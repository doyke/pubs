SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This supplement
was revised to complement the Interim Changes issued in AFI10-401 and includes new
MAJCOM-focused end-to-end sourcing methodology via the Expeditionary Combat Support
Consolidated Planning Schedule (ECS CPS) and a revised reclama methodology, and delineates
roles and responsibilities between functional area managers and commanders/functional
directors. This change also includes new collaborative resourcing methodology to expedite the
sourcing process of taskings reclama‘d under 75 days to first movement.
1.2.1. (Added) AFMC installations, direct reporting units (DRUs) and geographically
separated units (GSUs) must maintain the capability to execute Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)

member‗s required deployment preparations. Volunteering to support an exercise regardless of
ETL will not relieve any individual from an AEF deployment during their assigned vulnerability
period.
2.4.2.4. AFMC FAMs with personnel UTCs postured in the Enabler will ensure units establish a
deployment schedule to provide Airmen a measure of predictability.
2.4.2.4.1. (Added) If FAM/Directorate required, AFMC unit commanders will review/update
the deployment schedule annually and provide a copy of the schedule to the applicable AFMC
FAM(s). If required, Commanders will also establish procedures to ensure they do not violate
CSAF or SecDef redlines.
2.4.3.2. AEF Schedule Preparation Timeline. HQ AFMC/A3X will monitor and perform the
applicable tasks associated with planning for the upcoming AEF Schedule. AFMC FAMs will
complete all required actions in accordance with the schedule and inform HQ AFMC/A3X of

2.6.2. AFMC/A3X will send the appropriate FAM the AF FP‘s Collaborative Re-Sourcing
request with identified ALN‘s and IF personnel in the correct band to complete the assessment.
The FAM will assess all ALNs/IF personnel if applicable in the spreadsheets and provide
AFMC/A3X their assessment and recommended sourcing solution within the suspense date
provided. AFMC/A3X will forward assessment and recommendation to AF FP within suspense
timeline. Assessments will be categorized as either ―Low‖ – No or minimal impact to mission;
―Moderate‖ – Likely to accomplish all missions with some difficulty; ―Significant‖ – Substantial
impact to mission but may be able to fill with significant work around; or ―High‖ – Unable to
accomplish all missions; will require extraordinary measures to accomplish some missions.
2.11.1. All CJCS and USAF orders (Planning, Warning, Alert, Deployment Preparation,
Deployment and Execution) will be transmitted through Command Post channels in accordance
AFI10-401_AFMCSUP 6 DECEMBER 2012                                                            3

20Document%20Military%20only/Forms/AllItems.aspx
5.15.10.1. AFMC FAMs will identify a pilot unit to HQ AFMC/A4R for LOGDET purposes for
each UTC where AFMC is the MEFPAK Responsible Agency. AFMC FAMs will advise HQ
AFMC/A4R of all required changes to LOGFOR for AFMC MEFPAK UTCs.
5.15.12.2. AFMC MRA/pilot units will coordinate with base manpower office to ensure UTC
MANFOR detail (AFSC, Grade, FAC and PAX Quantity) accurately reflect UTC manpower
force requirement for any new or changes to pilot unit UTCs.
5.16.2. LOGFOR Reporting. HQ AFMC/A4R is Command OPR for LOGDET. IDOs must
submit LOGDET updates for MEFPAK pilot units to HQ AFMC/A4R as required.
7.5. UTC Posturing Concept Overview. AFMC FAMs will submit their deviation package to
the HQ AFMC/A3X for coordination prior to their 2 Letter Director‗s approval and submission
to AF/A3/5.
7.7. Overview of UTC Posturing. AFMC FAMs provide the necessary information to posture
UTCs in UTA to HQ AFMC/A3X. For Standard UTCs, provide the UTC designator, AEF
assignment, Posturing Availability Code and UIC. For Associate UTCs, provide UTC
designator, AEF assignment, Posturing Availability Code, UIC, AFSC and Grade.
7.9.1.1. AFMC FAMs submit requests for UTC additions/deletions in UTA to HQ AFMC/A3X
and provide justification, as required, for unlock requests.
7.9.1.2. AFMC FAMs will posture UTCs based on FAM prioritization and sequencing (P&S)
guidance for those organizations identified as a Combat, Combat Support (CS), or Combat
Service Support (CSS) in the JCS Unit Descriptor Code (UDC) field of the PAS file (see
Attachment 8). Institutional Force organizations are identified with a UDC of ―Other‖ and will
not posture UTCs.
7.9.1.4. AFMC FAMs will develop MAJCOM supplemental guidance to address AFMC unique
situations, as applicable, or when there is no Air Staff guidance. AFMC FAMs will coordinate
MAJCOM supplemental guidance with the AFMC AEF Cell and obtain approval of their 2-
Letter Director.
AFI10-401_AFMCSUP 6 DECEMBER 2012                                                          11


7.9.2.1.3. AFMC will not modify the UTA manpower detail. Notes on substitution rules may be
included in the commander‘s comment block of ART. Substitution rules and tailoring
requirements occur at execution sourcing/verification.
7.12.8.1.15. AFMC functional areas may request an additional Enabler category as required.
Each request must include the functional area, number and types of UTCs including equipment
and manpower detail, Unit Identification Codes (UICs), proposed Enabler category and
justification. All requests will be coordinated with HQ AFMC/A3X and approved by the
applicable HQ AFMC 2-Letter Director before submission to their HAF FAM and AF/A5XW
for coordination.
7.12.8.1.16. (Added) UTCs with personnel authorizations postured in the Enabler will be
prioritized for deployment by the tasked unit before the beginning of each AEF Schedule. The
deployment priority of each UTC will be rotated each AEF vulnerability period throughout the
AEF Schedule to provide a level of predictability and dwell to Airmen.
7.14. Procedures for P-Coding Standard Deployable UTCs. UTC posturing will comply
with Air Staff FAM prioritization and sequencing guidance. AFMC FAMs will posture the
maximum number of Standard Deployable UTCs (D* coded) as possible. Residual
authorizations that cannot be postured into Standard Deployable UTCs will be placed into
Associate (A* coded) UTCs.
7.14.1. AFMC FAMs will review P&S guidance and assist unit commanders (or equivalent)
with applying correct P-coding for Standard and Associate UTCs, prior to the beginning of each
AEF schedule. Once unit P-coding is agreed upon, FAMs will verify all data before and after P-
coding changes are accomplished in UTA. AFMC FAMs provide UTC posturing changes to HQ
AFMC/A3X to update UTA.
8.2.2. AFMC FAMs will review Supported Command TPFDDs upon request for tasking
supportability. AFMC FAMs will submit required changes to HQ AFMC/A3X and courtesy
copy their Air Force FAM. HQ AFMC/A3X will consolidate FAM inputs and provide
recommended changes to the OPR at the Supported Command‘s Air Force component
headquarters.
8.6.4. HQ AFMC/A3X is the Command OPR for PID allocation and administering ―08M‖ PID
Series.
8.10. TPFDD Sourcing Overview. HQ AFMC/A3X is the Command OPR for TPFDD UTC
requirements sourced to AFMC via DCAPES. HQ AFMC/A3X verifies requirements based
upon inputs provided by the AFMC FAMs and Installation Deployment Officers (IDOs).
TPFDDs will be made available to Command subordinate activities for planning immediately
following each operation plan‗s (OPlan‗s) initial refinement conference. Each OPlan‗s
JOPES/DCAPES data base will be made available to AFMC installation planners via GCCS.
HQ AFMC/A3X is the HQ AFMC OPR for CCDR and AF Component Commander TPFDD
sourcing. HQ AFMC/A3X will pass the sourcing requirements to the HQ AFMC FAMs. HQ
AFMC/A3X also provides access to the TPFDDs and tasking information to HQ AFMC/A1R.
HQ AFMC/A3X and HQ AFMC/A1R work together with the HQ AFMC FAMs to ensure each
TPFDD is properly sourced. Each AFMC Installation Commander‗s designated OPR is
responsible for ensuring the installation‗s data contained in the TPFDD is furnished to the
 12                                              AFI10-401_AFMCSUP 6 DECEMBER 2012


appropriate planning OPRs on the installation and required deployment planning and preparation
are completed.
8.14.3. HQ AFMC/A3X will monitor newsgroups daily and up channel significant events/issues
to AFMC senior leadership, as appropriate. AFMC installations and their GSUs will maintain a
capability to review designated newsgroups regularly to access tasking and TPFDD management
information. HQ AFMC/A3X will provide AFMC IDRCs a list of the applicable GCCS
newsgroups to be monitored upon request.
8.14.6.1.3.2. For short-notice taskings requiring immediate action (i.e., 5 days or less to first
movement), HQ AFMC/A3X will promptly notify the IDRC by e-mail and/or telephone to
complete name in system immediately.
8.14.6.3.1. HQ AFMC/A3X accomplishes MAJCOM verification of deployment tasking
requirements to the Supported Command‘s Air Force component headquarters.
8.14.6.3.2. IDOs are the installation‗s focal point for all deployment related matters covered by
AFI 10-403, Air Force Deployment Planning and Execution.
8.14.6.3.3. (Added) Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) will verify the readiness of UTCs
tasked to deploy to their host installation.
8.14.7.1.2. AFMC/A3X will contact the AFMC FAM to review and verify the sourced
requirement can be filled by the tasked unit. Once the FAM reviews requirement they will notify
A3X in person or by SIPR message to complete verification and initiate base-level names in
system process when applicable. A3X will verify tasking in AFVC relieving the IDRC of having
to ―BX‖ or ―NXX‖ requirement.
8.14.7.1.3. Total time to complete verification (―S‖ project code in ULN record) of tasking
requirements is 3 duty days during normal AEF rotational operations, or within 24 hours during
crisis action operations. Requirement timeline for verification begins upon receipt of a sourcing
nomination from AFPC/DPW and ends when MAJCOM verification is provided to the
Supported Command‗s Air Force component headquarters.
8.14.7.1.3.1. (Added) Short notice tasking requirements (i.e., within 45 calendar days of the
scheduled first movement) will be verified to the Supported Command‗s Air Force component
headquarters within 24 hours.
8.14.8. AFMC/A3X will monitor force modules to ensure all requirements are being processed
in required timelines.
8.14.8.2.2.2. AFMC FAMs will provide risk assessment to HQ AFMC/A3X within 24 hours of
notification of need to surge. HQ AFMC/A3X will review and coordinate on risk assessment.
After HQ AFMC/A3X coordination, AFMC FAMs will provide risk assessment to their
respective HAF FAM NLT 48 hours after notification of surge. Risk assessments will be signed
by the FAM‗s 2-Ltr Director before submitting to HAF FAM.
8.14.9. Verification. AFMC FAMs verify the tasked unit can provide the capability being
requested prior to HQ AFMC/A3X completing verification in AFVC. This includes reviewing
the DCAPES ULN record data elements (level 2 and line level detail), checking the UTC ready
status in ART (as applicable), pre-deployment training and/or verifying UTC readiness/personnel
availability with the tasked unit. AFMC FAMs shall ensure the tasking requirement is
AFI10-401_AFMCSUP 6 DECEMBER 2012                                                               13


supportable and resolve issues with their respective AFPC Scheduler, AF FAM and/or AF
component FAM, prior to verification whenever possible.

8.14.9.2.1. AFMC AEF Cell has obtained a waiver to bypass this requirement and streamline the
process.
8.14.9.2.2. AFMC AEF Cell has obtained a waiver to bypass this requirement and streamline the
process.
8.14.9.2.3. AFMC AEF Cell has obtained a waiver to bypass this requirement and streamline the
process.
8.15. Force Reporting. The AFMC Commander, HQ AFMC CAT Director or higher authority
may direct the commencement of AFMC situation reporting by installation (Center SITREP) and
a consolidated Command SITREP at any time during a contingency operation.
8.19.1. When contacted by TPFDD owner to review and provide updated capabilities data,
AFMC/A3X will coordinate with applicable FAMs for review, update, and approval of their plan
contribution. Once A3X compiles all comments they will provide one consolidated AFMC
response for updates to the TPFDD.
9.6. AEF Sourcing Plans and Tasks Timeline. AFMC/A3X will distribute the AEF Sourcing
Plans and Tasks Timeline for each rotation to AFMC FAMs and IDRCs for situational
awareness. Upon direction the AFMC AEF Cell will analyze the ECS CPS and obtain HQ
AFMC 2-Ltr review and coordination. Once all reviews are completed AFMC/A3X (ECS SIPT
Member) will provide a consolidated ECS CPS response to AFPC/DPW IAW timelines
established.
9.7.6. AEF Association Review. Unit commanders (or equivalent) will review AEFIs of all
assigned personnel on a monthly basis to ensure the individuals AEF association to assigned
UTCs or the X Band, as applicable, is correct. Missing or incorrect AEFIs will be
corrected/submitted by the unit to the IPR office for update in MilPDS. After 15 days upon
signing into the base if the AEFI is still missing the member is considered eligible for any AEF
deployment tasking until their AEFI is loaded into MILPDS. If a member receives an AEF
tasking due to a missing AEFI the tasking is considered valid due to information available at the
time of sourcing.
 14                                              AFI10-401_AFMCSUP 6 DECEMBER 2012


9.7.7. Posturing Code (P-Code) Review. AFMC FAMs review UTC posturing codes for their
functional area prior to the start of the AEF Schedule and coordinates with the affected units.
AFMC FAMs provide UTC changes to HQ AFMC/A3X to update UTA NLT 9 months prior to
the start of each AEF Vulnerability Period.
9.9.3. MAJCOM TPFDD Verification. MAJCOM verification (―S‖ project code in ULN
record) will be completed within 3 duty days for routine sourcing in support of an upcoming
AEF rotation. HQ AFMC/A3X will notify the FAM via e-mail and/or telephone upon receipt of
a tasking requirement that requires pre-verification. FAMs may request an extension to the
verification requirement on a case-by-case basis. Verification will be completed within 24 hours
during short notice and crisis action sourcing. ―Short notice‖ is defined as any tasking
requirement 45 calendar days or less from the scheduled first movement.
9.13.1. Upon receiving a tasking with a status code of ―S‖ the ULN record will be changed to
―P‖ (ready for IPR to assign names) by the base IDO. The IDO will pull tasking records from
DCAPES at least twice each duty day and ensure tasked units are notified. If requested by the
IDO, the IPR, wing manpower office, or logistics plans function will prepare a levy export file of
taskings from DCAPES for import into LOGMOD. IDRCs will conduct TPFDD line-by-line
reviews daily to ensure all ULN transactions that alter any JOPES characteristics from a previous
day‘s TPFDD are reconciled. Additionally, IDRCs will compare the daily TPFDD pull with data
in Deployed Personnel Taskings (DPT) to verify all taskings reflected on the TPFDD are also
present in DPT. If taskings on the daily TPFDD pull are not present in DPT after 3 duty days (1
duty day for short notice), the IDRCs must contact the AFMC AEF Cell for resolution. The IPR
office will enter the SSAN of individuals identified by the unit commander to fill the tasking
requirement in DCAPES NLT 5 duty days of verification and flip record from ―P‖ to ―C‖. For
short notice taskings, the SSAN must be entered in DCAPES and record flipped from ―P‖ to ―C‖
within 24 hours of completing MAJCOM verification. **Note: Tasking is not completed until
the record is flipped from ―P‖ to ―C‖ by the IPR office.
9.13.2. (Added) Base Manpower has been removed from day to day tasking (non-ORE/ORI)
verification process. IDO will change tasking status from ―D‖ to ―P‖.
AFI10-401_AFMCSUP 6 DECEMBER 2012                                                             15


Figure 9.7. (Added) AFMC Names in System Process




9.14.1.1. On-Call Status (AD only). AFMC On-Call guidance:
9.14.1.1.1. (Added) Individuals assigned to an AEF but not tasked to deploy or in an on-call
status are considered residual resources during their AEF Vulnerability Period. These individuals
serve as the residual capability throughout the assigned AEF period or until tasked to deploy in
support of an AEF tasking.
9.14.1.1.2. (Added) On-call or residual personnel may take leave and perform temporary duty
during their AEF Vulnerability Period at the discretion of the unit commander. Approval of leave
and/or TDY is contingent upon the individual‘s ability to be present for duty, complete all pre-
deployment requirements and deploy within 72 hours (or sooner as required by the UTC
MISCAP) using normal recall procedures. Commanders should not approve leave to remote
areas (e.g., beyond normal communications) and long duration TDYs where the individual
cannot be contacted for extended periods of time or far from home station making timely return
unlikely.
9.14.1.1.3. (Added) AEF on-call or residual status does not preclude an individual‗s
availability for on-base activities including participation in local exercises and short-duration
training.
9.15. Response Timing. Installation Personnel Readiness (IPR) prepares CED orders for
deploying forces following verification and name entered in the system.
9.19.2. Volunteer Guidance. If an Airman volunteers to fill a requirement inside their assigned
AEF period, he/she must complete the volunteer statement (due to the fact they were not
obligated to a tasking). They must first obtain approval of their Unit Commander and
coordination from their MAJCOM FAM before obtaining approval from their
 16                                               AFI10-401_AFMCSUP 6 DECEMBER 2012


installation/center/complex/wing commander (Volunteers from HQ AFMC staff will need their
2-Ltr approval and volunteers from Center level will follow Center CC guidance not to be lower
than Wing CC equivalent). Upon approval, he/she must provide the volunteer availability notice
to the AFMC FAM. Commanders must consider this important point: if the volunteer becomes
unable to deploy for any reason after being selected for the deployment, the unit will be required
to replace the individual or submit a reclama if no replacement can be found.
9.19.3. Volunteer Implementation Guidance. If an AFMC Airman volunteers to fill a
requirement outside his or her assigned AEF window, he/she must first obtain approval through
their chain of command to include the wing commander (HQ AFMC staff will need their 2-Ltr
approval and Centers will need Center CC approval). Once approved, the unit informs AFMC
FAM of the volunteer and the individual completes the required volunteer statement. Provide the
volunteer availability notice to the AFMC FAM. Commanders must consider two important
points: (1) the volunteer is still subject to deployment in his/her assigned AEF vulnerability
period and (2) if the volunteer is unable to deploy for any reason after being selected for the
deployment, the unit must replace the individual. If no replacement can be found, the unit must
initiate a reclama action.
9.19.3.1. Volunteer Implementation Guidance. If an AFMC Airman volunteers to fill a
requirement outside their assigned AEF period, they must complete the volunteer statement and
first obtain approval of their Unit Command followed by their MAJCOM FAM before obtaining
approval of their installation/complex/wing commander (Volunteers from HQ AFMC staff will
need their 2-Ltr approval and volunteers from Center level will follow Center CC guidance not
to be lower than Wing CC equivalent). Provide the volunteer availability notice to the AFMC
FAM. Commanders must consider two important points: (1) the volunteer is still subject to
deployment in his/her assigned AEF vulnerability period and (2) if the volunteer is unable to
deploy for any reason after being selected for the deployment, the unit must replace the
individual. If no replacement can be found, the unit must initiate a reclama action. Members
who receive a DAV 81 as a result of a volunteer deployment cannot use this as justification for a
reclama during their normal AEF window.
9.22. AEF Debrief Concept. The AFMC AEF Debrief is conducted every 6 months following
each AEF deployment rotation period, usually in May and Nov, and is chaired by AFMC/CV
with HQ AFMC/A1/A3/A4 and Installation Commanders as participants. HQ AFMC/A3X is the
Command OPR and has overall responsibility for scheduling, preparing and conducting the AEF
Debrief. HQ AFMC/A1R/A4R as Command OCRs are responsible for their assigned AEF areas
and assisting HQ AFMC/A3X in preparing for the debrief.
9.23.1. HQ AFMC/A3X is AFMC‘s charter member of the Expeditionary Combat Support
Integrated Process Team (ECS SIPT) and Command OPR for AEF planning/scheduling in
support of SecDef GFM and APEX.
9.23.2. HQ AFMC/A3X is AFMC‘s charter member of the AEF Steering Group.
9.24.2. ECS CPS Coordination. HQ AFMC/A3X will analyze ECS CPS and provide FAMs
with their equity to review for supportability. HQ AFMC/A3X will compile all FAM/2-Ltr
Directorate inputs to ECS CPS and respond within timelines established.
9.24.6. HQ AFMC/A3X will provide AFMC FAMs with the ECS CPS. FAMs have the
responsibility to notify units and acknowledge taskings they are scheduled to fulfill at execution.
AFI10-401_AFMCSUP 6 DECEMBER 2012                                                             17


10.11.1. IPRs will send a copy of all waiver requests via SIPR to their IDO, HQ AFMC/A1R,
HQ AFMC/A3X and AFMC FAM.
10.11.4. AFMC tasked units will initiate a reclama after 3 duty days (24 hours for requirements
within 75 days of first movement) of submitting a waiver request if unanswered. Units will enter
information on the unanswered waiver in the unit justification section of the reclama in RPT.
Justification will include information on the original waiver request and follow-up attempts made
during the 3 days (i.e., telephone calls/e-mails to PERSCO).
10.15.1.2. AFMC will posture Associate UTCs in lieu of tailored (Standard) UTCs in UTA.
10.16.2. AFMC FAMs prepare the waiver request and coordinate with HQ AFMC/A3X prior to
submission to AF/A5XW and Air Staff FAM.
10.21. Shortfall/Reclama/UIC. In the event AFMC/CV is unavailable, AFMC/CA may
approve or disapprove a "Severe Mission Impact" reclama.
10.21.2.5. "Severe Mission Impact": The following procedures apply for all ―Severe Mission
Impact‖ reclamas submitted by AFMC units. See Attachments 9 and 10 for guidance on reclama
information processing at the Installation and HQ AFMC respectively. Each request will include
justification to support the recommendation to approve or disapprove the reclama and explain
why the individual and/or unit cannot support the tasking. Clearly state the impact (i.e. loss of
funding, project over-runs, personnel/unit impacts, etc.) to the unit/home station mission if the
member deployed. Include the following information as applicable to the tasked unit: 1) Number
and types of UTCs assigned if applicable; 2) Unit and base military manning (# authorized / #
assigned for the tasked AFSC, civilian manning and any unique circumstances (e.g., individual
tasked is assigned to a one-deep position as a GSU); 3) Number of personnel (military and
civilian) currently deployed and tasked to deploy; and 4) the projected return date of those
currently deployed.
10.21.2.5.1. (Added) The owning Center Commander will approve/disapprove all "Severe
Mission Impact" reclamas except for HQ AFMC initiated reclamas. The decision will be entered
in the ―Wing CC/Equivalent Recommendation/Remarks‖ field in the Reclama Processing Tool
(RPT). The RPT entry will include the name, rank, organization/office symbol, and date of the
decision.
10.21.2.5.1.1. (Added) If the "Severe Mission Impact" is a IF tasking then the following
additional information must be added to the Wing CC remarks section in RPT. Taskee‗s Rank
Full Name, Taskee‗s SSN, Taskee‗s PAS Code, IF Taskee‗s UDC-X Code [X1-X5] in MilPDS,
IF requirement‗s Tasking Type (from DCAPES), Deferment Stop Date (NGT RDD+6 months,
as applicable for operational reasons), Taskee‗s Unit CC or MAJCOM unit CC lvl POC contact
info and POC Rank/Name/Org/DSN/Email address.
10.21.2.5.2. (Added) Owning Center Commander decisions will be supported by amplifying
comments that clearly state the reason for the approval or disapproval of a reclama. The reclama
justification must demonstrate ―mission failure‖ to the tasked unit if the individual deployed.
Supporting documentation (See Attachment 9) will accompany all "Severe Mission Impact"
reclama packages.
 18                                            AFI10-401_AFMCSUP 6 DECEMBER 2012


10.21.2.5.3. (Added) "Severe Mission Impact" reclamas that are ―approved‖ by the Center
Commander are forward to the HQ AFMC Functional Directorate to obtain AFMC/CV final
decision.
10.21.2.5.3.1. (Added) AFMC FAM-initiated or MAJCOM reclamas do not need to be staffed
through the IDO, wing commander or center commander. The AFMC FAM and UDM will fill in
the unit commander and IDO fields in RPT. The FAM will enter their Director‘s
approval/disapproval in the Wing Commander Remarks section. For "Severe Mission Impact"
reclamas, the FAM will prepare a staff package IAW with the guidance in paragraphs
10.21.2.5.4. (Added) The MAJCOM Functional Area Manager (FAM) is the responsible
Action Officer for staffing a "Severe Mission Impact" Reclama at HQ AFMC. The FAM
prepares the reclama staff package (see Attachment 10) with a staff summary sheet (SSS), RPT
printout with the FAM recommendation, supporting documentation and any additional
information required to ascertain a complete and accurate picture of the situation and mission

request will include compelling justification explaining why each individual requires a
Deployment Availability (DAV) Code 64 (Operational Deferment) to support critical mission
requirements at home station and an expiration date. Commanders may submit requests up to a
year prior to the start of the individual‗s AEF Vulnerability Period to ensure the DAV 64 is
entered in MilPDS prior to the sourcing verification period (usually 7-8 months prior to the start
of the rotation). The expiration date of the DAV code will be the day following the conclusion of
the individual‗s AEF Vulnerability Period. All requests will be coordinated with the applicable
HQ AFMC 2-Ltr Directorate prior to approval to de-conflict with functional area prioritization
and sequencing guidance as required. Units may use the eSSS template at Attachment 12 of this
supplement to request a DAV 64 from the Unit Commander up to the MAJCOM. Personnel that

Code 64 assignments for validity at least annually and submit required changes to the FSS/IPR
office. In addition, DAV Code 64 assignments will be reviewed monthly during the Command
ART/SORTS/DRRS readiness briefing and semiannually during the AEF Debrief for significant
issues and trends. Note: individuals with an approved operational deferment may be tasked to
deploy, as required, in support of contingencies to include but not limited to surge operations or
crisis response actions.
14.3.6. Prior to newly assigned individuals departing on house-hunting or any kind of leave,
gaining commanders need to assign an AEFI to ensure the 15 day suspense is met and to
preclude the individual from being tasked to deploy inadvertently.
14.3.7. Unit Commanders (or equivalent) will provide new or changed AEF alignments to the
FSS‗s IPR office. Commanders must ensure the member‗s AEFI is updated in MilPDS.
Commanders will verify the status of their unit and individual assigned AEFI‘s by utilizing the
AEF Report in the Base Level Service Delivery Model (BLSDM) monthly.

will ensure Airmen‘s AEFI is properly coded in MilPDS and notify Airmen in writing of their
AEF association and vulnerability period.
14.4.1. AFMC/CV waiver is not required if the individual‗s AEF must be changed as a result of
higher headquarters direction (e.g., re-banding UTCs or moving Airmen at Institutional Force
units to equally distribute AFSCs across the X Band). If Wing Commanders or equivalent
approve a second deployment with less than dwell then they must report this action to HQ
AFMC/A1R prior to the AEF debrief.
14.4.1.4. Installation Commanders will provide HQ AFMC/A3X a listing of Airmen that filled
out-of-cycle requirements or short notice individual augmentation requests prior to the AFMC
AEF Debrief.

-------------------------------STAFF SUMMARY
AO: Rank & Name, XXX FLTS, DSN # XXX-XXXX
SUSPENSE: XX May XX, SOCCER # XXXXXXX

SUBJECT: Deployment Availability Coding (DAV) 64 (Operational Deferment) Package
for XXXth FLTS personnel.

1. PURPOSE: Obtain AFTC/CC approval on Operational Deferment package for XXXth
FLTS personnel.

2. BACKGROUND: Request DAV Code 64 designation for the following individual due to
the severe adverse impact his deployment would have on the operational mission of the XXXth
Flight Test Squadron during the AEFI X5 vulnerability period. Specifically, it would delay the
scheduled completion of the following XXX flight test programs: .

3. DISCUSSION: Major XXX XXX is a primary B-1 pilot in the squadron and functions as
XXX Pilot. Maj XXX is currently one of only 3 qualified XXX instructor pilots assigned to the
squadron, to include the XXX FLTS/CC. Additional XXX pilot manning includes one DT
qualified pilot who is the Operations Officer at the XX TES with limited availability and one
additional 31 TES operational pilot with zero test experience. Over the next year the XXX will
be executing developmental flight test XXX out of two locations, Edwards and Dyess, in
addition to planning and reporting on several other programs. The XXth is already below a
manning level that is considered sufficient to properly plan and execute the flight test
requirements we have for the XXX. The XXXth will lose one of the three DT pilots in late
spring as the commander will be moving on to a new assignment following his two year point,
leaving only Maj XXX and one other pilot to accomplish all of the DT responsibilities. One
new test pilot will be joining the squadron following his graduation from USAF Test Pilot
School in late summer, but he is not expected to be qualified in the XXX until late Fall/early
winter. Maximizing the two remaining XXX pilots during the summer and fall of 2012 is the
current plan to continue test. During a typical week, one of them is at Dyess and one of them
remains at Edwards. Deployment of Maj XXX would negate that plan. Specifically, in order to
ensure uninterrupted flight test operations, Maj XXX must be on station to complete flight test
as the DT responsible XXX aircrew member at either Edwards or Dyess through the summer
and fall of 2012. Additionally, the XXXth would lose one of the only two XXX pilot solely

dedicated to planning, executing and reporting on a multitude XXX DT programs. Should Maj
XXXX deploy for 179 days, our new DT test pilot will be greatly delayed in completing XXX,
Maj XXX will lose his XXX qualification, and the XXXth will be unable to support continuous
flight test execution starting summer of 2012. Specifically, this would result in (1) mission
failure for the XXX and XXX program due to the requirement for an all-DT crew for multiple
missions and (2) significant delays (weeks or months) to the XXX DT programs being executed
off station due to the program requirements of having at least one DT pilot in the
missions. Recommend that Maj XXX be given a DAV Code 64, effective through the duration
of the AEFI X5 vulnerability period: 1 Apr – 30 Sep 2012.

4. RECOMMENDATION: AFTC/CC approve this DAV 64 request.
