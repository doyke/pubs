                                          Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. General. This positional performance evaluation criterion, in conjunction with AFI 13-1-1-
202 Volume 2, provides both the examiner and examinee with procedures and evaluation criteria
for use during the conduct of Initial Qualification (INIT QUAL), Mission Qualification (MSN),
Qualification (QUAL), Requalification (RQ), and Spot Evaluations. Adherence to these
procedures and criteria ensure an accurate and standardized assessment of the proficiency and
capabilities of the examinee. Standardization/Evaluation examiners (examiner) and examinees
will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed rating criteria in this document.
1.2. Recommended Changes. Recommendations for changes are encouraged, and must focus
on specific areas and standards of performance. Forward comments through channels (HQ
ACC/A3Y, HQ PACAF/A3O, HQ USAFE/A3Y, or to HQ USAF/A3O-AY using AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication. HQ USAF/A3 is the approval authority for interim
changes to this AFI.
1.3. Waivers. HQ ACC/A3Y (ACC/ANG units), HQ PACAF/A3O (PACAF units), and HQ
USAFE/A3Y (USAFE units) will serve as the MAJCOM OPR with waiver authority for all
waiver requests to this instruction. File a copy of approved written waivers with this volume
IAW AFI 33-360, Volume 1.
   1.3.1. All waiver requests will be submitted via electronic means through channels to the
   appropriate MAJCOM OPR. MAJCOMs will forward a copy of all approved supplements to
   AF/A3O-AYO.
1.4. Evaluation Methods. The primary methods of determining the examinee’s level of job
knowledge and proficiency are academic testing and observation of job performance. The
questioning of examinees during the positional portion of the evaluation should be limited to
items not determined by observation, but related to the scenarios being employed for evaluation.
1.5. Evaluation Procedures. Examiners will conduct evaluations in accordance with (IAW)
this AFI.
   1.5.1. Written Examination (WE). The WE is the master question file (MQF) written
   examination. The WE will be administered IAW AFI 13-1-1-202 Vol. 2, Section 4C. For
   initial evaluations, all written examinations must be completed prior to the positional
   evaluation. For RQ the written examinations will be completed at the discretion of the Chief,
   Stan Eval.
   1.5.2. Positional Evaluation. The examiner will provide the examinee a briefing explaining
   how the evaluation will be conducted. The examiner will evaluate the examinee’s
   performance for each graded area and note discrepancies when deviations from prescribed
   performance criteria occur during the evaluation. The judgment of the examiner will be the
   determining factor in assigning the overall grade for the examinee’s performance.
       1.5.2.1. The examiner will not occupy a primary crew position during the evaluation.
   1.5.3. The examiner will not stop the evaluation unless continuing the evaluation would
   result in an unsafe act.
10                                                         AFI13-1CRCV2 27 OCTOBER 2009


     1.5.4. During the live mission portion of the evaluation, the examiner will make every effort
     to evaluate the examinee’s performance in all required areas. When live flying cannot be
     used to evaluate a required area or task because of equipment malfunction, weather
     conditions, operational requirements, etc, use guidance in AFI 13-1-1-202, Volume 2, to
     determine if an alternate method (e.g., simulation or verbal evaluation) can be used to
     complete the evaluation. If an alternate evaluation method is used, the Examiner will
     document the method under the Mission Description paragraph in the Remarks section of the
     AF Form 8, Certification of Aircrew Qualification, IAW AFI 13-1-1-202, Volume 2.
     1.5.5. Simulation Profiles. The examiner will ensure all simulation profiles used in the
     evaluation will accomplish the following: reflect unit daily training missions and unit
     tasking, provide realistic assessment of examinee capabilities, and provide assessment of the
     application of current tactics, techniques, and procedures. Units will build simulation
     evaluation profile missions and will include a scenario and other pertinent information that
     would normally be available in theater Air Tasking Order (ATO), Airspace Control Order
     (ACO), Operational Tasking Data Link (OPTASKLINK), intelligence data such as air and
     ground order of battle, political assessment, etc. The examiner will be responsible for
     selecting simulation equipment operators and managing the simulated scenarios. The
     examiner will not hold the evaluatee liable for simulator operator errors, non-simulated
     scenario errors, or aircrew errors committed during the live mission portion of the evaluation.
1.6. Rating Policy. Examiners will use the rating policy contained in AFI 13-1-1-202, Volume
2, and the evaluation criteria in this instruction for conducting evaluations. A three-level rating
system is used for the overall grade. They are: Qualification Level 1 (Q-1), Qualification Level 2
(Q-2), Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). A three-level rating system is also used for individual areas
and is detailed in paragraph 1.7.
     1.6.1. Exceptionally Qualified Designation. An exceptionally qualified designation may be
     awarded by the examiner. The designation can only be applied to the total evaluation - not to
     separate evaluation areas. The designation may be awarded when:
        1.6.1.1. The crewmember has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in all
        phases of the evaluation;
        1.6.1.2. The crewmember has not failed any evaluation area and;
        1.6.1.3. The crewmember received a qualified grade with no remedial action on all
        areas/subareas evaluated during positional evaluations.
        1.6.1.4. The crewmember has achieved a score of 96% or greater on all portions of the
        written examinations.
     1.6.2. Qualification Level 1. The crewmember demonstrated desired performance and
     knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the grading
     criteria. This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted and may be awarded when
     discrepancies are noted if: The discrepancies resulted in no ―U‖ grades being given in any
     area(s)/subarea(s); in the judgment of the examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
     awarding of an overall ―Q-1‖; all discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared
     during the debrief of that evaluation.
AFI13-1CRCV2 27 OCTOBER 2009                                                                    11


   1.6.3. Qualification Level 2. The crewmember demonstrated the ability to perform duties
   safely, but: There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
   assigned; a non-critical area/subarea grade of ―U‖ was awarded; in the judgment of the
   examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/subareas.
   1.6.4. Qualification Level 3. The crewmember demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety,
   performance or knowledge. An area grade of ―U‖ awarded in a critical area requires an
   overall ―Q-3‖ for the evaluation. An overall ―Q-3‖ can be awarded if, in the judgment of the
   examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/subareas.
1.7. Required Evaluation Areas. Required evaluation areas are defined as all areas (and
associated sub-areas) identified in this document.
   1.7.1. Evaluation tasks are shown in the appropriate evaluation area, along with the rating
   scale for each task. Each area/task has a three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system. The overall
   area grade will reflect the majority of the ratings assessed for the examinee’s achievement of
   tasked sub-areas.
       1.7.1.1. Q. A ―Q‖ is the desired level of performance. This grade is given when the
       examinee demonstrates a satisfactory knowledge of all required information and performs
       mission duties within the prescribed tolerances and accomplishes the assigned mission.
       1.7.1.2. Q-. A ―Q-‖ indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area tasks
       without supervision, but requires additional training unless, in the judgment of the
       examiner, it will not constructively improve the examinee’s performance. Deviations
       from established standards must not exceed the prescribed ―Q-‖ tolerances or jeopardize
       flight safety.
       1.7.1.3. U. Assign a ―U‖ area grade for any performance outside allowable parameters
       and for deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely affect mission
       accomplishment or compromise flight safety. An examinee receiving an area grade of
       ―U‖ requires additional training.
1.8. Critical Rating Areas. Critical rating areas have been established for examinee positional
evaluations. Critical areas are defined as areas that contain critical tasks and are identified by
―(CRITICAL)‖ following the applicable area title. Critical tasks require the examinee to follow
mandatory procedures and directives; failure to successfully accomplish the task directly impacts
either overall mission success or personnel/flight safety. Critical tasks can only be graded ―Q‖ or
―U‖. If an examinee's performance is graded ―U‖ for any critical task, the area grade must be
marked ―U,‖ and the overall grade for the evaluation must be ―Q-3‖.
1.9. Post Evaluation. The examiner will assess the examinee’s performance with the rating
criteria and assign a grade for each area. When the examinee’s performance is measured using a
range of performance, the examiner will apply the rating criteria within the range limits. The
examiner will debrief, with the examinee, the overall rating, specific deviations, grades assigned,
and any additional training the examinee may be required to complete. The debriefing will be
annotated in the Remarks section of AF Form 8, Certification of Aircrew Qualification. All
evaluation results will also be debriefed with the examinee’s squadron commander/operations
officer (or designated representative).

            BATTLE STAFF COORDINATOR QUALIFICATION EVALUATION

Section 2A—Instructions.

2.1. General.
     2.1.1. This chapter contains the criteria specifying the tasks required of a qualified Battle
     Staff Coordinator (BSC) positional evaluation.
     2.1.2. Certain areas contain performance tasks that require a degree of
     knowledge/proficiency that is mandatory for successful mission accomplishment and to
     ensure safety of flight. Consequently, a ―Q-3‖ score in any ―Critical‖ area will result in an
     overall grade of ―Q-3.‖
     2.1.3. BSC performance evaluations will be conducted using an operational mission crew
     and mission scenario during routine daily operations and/or a Mission Training Exercise
     (MTE) as defined in MAJCOM guidance. When possible, the evaluation will be conducted
     with a full operational crew, either during routine daily operations or while using an
     operational mission crew and mission scenario. Tasks not observed and assessed during the
     normal course of the evaluation will be evaluated separately while the examinee is on
     position.
2.2. Evaluation Objective. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to accomplish all BSC
duties safely and effectively IAW technical orders, applicable operations directives and
MAJCOM Standardization Evaluation checklists.

     Crew Commander (MCC).
     3.1.2. Certain areas contain performance tasks that require a degree of
     knowledge/proficiency that is mandatory for successful mission accomplishment and to
     ensure safety of flight. Consequently, a ―U‖ score in any ―Critical‖ area will result in an
     overall grade of ―Q-3.‖
     3.1.3. MCC performance evaluations will be conducted during a Mission Training Exercise
     (MTE), as defined in MAJCOM guidance, or during live operations. Tasks not observed and
     assessed during the normal course of the evaluation will be evaluated separately while the
     examinee is on position. The evaluation will include participation of at least one or more
     external TACS units and, when possible, conducted with a full operational crew. If a full
     operations crew is used, an Air Defense Artillery (ADA) interface should be simulated.
     When possible, the evaluation will be conducted in a controlled radar and communications
     jamming environment; otherwise, radar and communications jamming will be simulated.
3.2. Evaluation Objective. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to accomplish all MCC
duties safely and effectively IAW technical orders and applicable operations directives.

                  SENIOR DIRECTOR QUALIFICATION EVALUATION

Section 4A—Instructions.

4.1. General.
     4.1.1. This chapter contains the criteria specifying the tasks required of a qualified Senior
     Director (SD).
     4.1.2. Certain areas contain performance tasks that require a degree of
     knowledge/proficiency that is mandatory for successful mission accomplishment and to
     ensure safety of flight. Consequently, a ―U‖ score in any ―Critical‖ area will result in an
     overall grade of ―Q-3.‖
     4.1.3. SD performance evaluations will be conducted during a Mission Training Exercise
     (MTE), as defined in MAJCOM guidance, as well as a live environment. Tasks not observed
     and assessed during the normal course of the evaluation will be evaluated separately while
     the examinee is on position. (NOTE: The 607ACS is exempt from those tasks requiring
     participation in a MTE.) The SD will supervise a minimum of two controllers performing a
     live mission. The evaluation, when possible, will be conducted with a full operational crew.
     When possible, the evaluation will be conducted in a controlled radar and communications
     jamming environment; otherwise, radar and communications jamming will be simulated. An
     Air Defense Artillery (ADA) interface should be simulated. The SD will maintain a current
     weapons qualification and be evaluated IAW the tasks below:
        4.1.3.1. SD examinees will be evaluated on air-to-air, air refueling, and air-to-surface
        missions. Examiners will make the determination as to whether briefed/conducted
        control activities meet/fulfill control requirements. The live mission does not have to
        conform to a specific profile if the unit is unable to schedule aircraft to conduct such a
        mission. At least one air-to-air mission must be evaluated in the live/virtual/DTOC
        constructive environment. Air refueling mission will be evaluated in a live/DMO/DTOC
        constructive or simulator environment. The examiner will document the evaluation
        environment (live/virtual/sim) in the Mission Description paragraph in the Remarks
        section of the AF Form 8, IAW AFI 13-1-1-202, Vol. 2. Other missions not evaluated in
        the live environment may be evaluated using simulation. If necessary, all events may be
        accomplished using the same set of assets.
        4.1.3.2. Air-to-air missions will be conducted where weapons examinees provide tactical
        or broadcast control, as briefed by the aircrew. The control will be provided to at least

WEAPONS DIRECTOR/AIR WEAPONS OFFICER QUALIFICATION EVALUATION

Section 5A—Instructions.

5.1. General.
     5.1.1. This chapter contains the criteria specifying the tasks required of a qualified Weapons
     Director/Air Weapons Officer Qualification Evaluation.
     5.1.2. Certain areas contain performance tasks that require a degree of
     knowledge/proficiency that is mandatory for successful mission accomplishment and to
     ensure safety of flight. Consequently, a ―U‖ score in any ―Critical‖ area will result in an
     overall grade of ―Q-3.‖
        5.1.2.1. WD/AWO performance evaluations will be conducted during a Mission
        Training Exercise (MTE), as defined in MAJCOM guidance, as well as a live
        environment. Tasks not observed and assessed during the normal course of the
        evaluation will be evaluated separately while the examinee is on position. At least one
        ―live‖ air-to-air mission, supervised by an SD, must be evaluated. When possible, the
        evaluation will be conducted with a full operational crew. When possible, the evaluation
        will be conducted in a controlled radar and communications jamming environment;
        otherwise, radar and communications jamming will be simulated. The WD/AWO will
        maintain a current weapons qualification and be evaluated IAW the tasks below:
        5.1.2.2. WD/AWO examinees will be evaluated on air-to-air, air refueling, and air-to-
        surface missions. Examiners will make the determination as to whether briefed/conducted
        control activities fulfill control requirements. The live mission does not have to conform
        to a specific profile if the unit is unable to schedule aircraft to conduct such a mission. At
        least one air-to-air mission must be evaluated in the live /virtual/DTOC constructive
        environment. The air refueling mission will be evaluated in a live/DMO/DTOC
        constructive or simulator environment. The examiner will document the evaluation
        environment (live/virtual/sim) in the Mission Description paragraph in the Remarks
        section of the AF Form 8, IAW AFI 13-1-1-202, Vol. 2. Other missions not evaluated in
        the live environment may be evaluated using simulation. If necessary, all events may be
        accomplished using the same set of assets.
        5.1.2.3. Air-to-air missions will be conducted where weapons examinees use the
        continuum of control as briefed by the aircrew. The control will be provided to at least
        two fighters committed against adversaries. The examiner will ensure the weapons
        examinee participates in all phases of the mission. NOTE: It is not a requirement for this
        mission to result in a maneuvering dogfight.
        5.1.2.4. Air refueling evaluations require control be provided to at least two separate
        receivers rendezvousing on one or more tankers. The weapons examinee must
        demonstrate both point parallel and receiver turn-on rendezvous tactics using close
        control procedures.
AFI13-1CRCV2 27 OCTOBER 2009                                                                    35


        5.1.2.5. During air-to-surface evaluations, the WD/AWO directs at least one flight of
        aircraft conducting air-to-surface tactics against a ground objective. The WD/AWO will
        control the flight from check-in to the prosecution of at least one objective, or until the
        criteria for swapping controllers is met. An air-to surface mission must include the
        following elements:
            5.1.2.5.1. Airspace management: Assigning altitude blocks, and/or safe deconfliction
            between aircraft (manned/unmanned)
            5.1.2.5.2. Target Area Brief: Air or ground picture and the objective area
            5.1.2.5.3. Dynamic/deliberate Tasking: Updated or pre-planned objective
            5.1.2.5.4. MISREP: Mission results
5.2. Evaluation Objective. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to operate safely and
effectively IAW technical orders, air traffic control (ATC) regulations, and other applicable
directives.

Section 6A—Instructions.

6.1. General
     6.1.1. This chapter contains the criteria specifying the tasks required of a qualified Air
     Surveillance Officer/Technician (ASO/AST).
     6.1.2. Certain areas contain performance tasks that require a degree of
     knowledge/proficiency that is mandatory for successful mission accomplishment and to
     ensure safety of flight. Consequently, a ―U‖ score in any ―Critical‖ area will result in an
     overall grade of ―Q-3.‖
     6.1.3. ASO/AST performance evaluations will be conducted during a Mission Training
     Exercise (MTE) as defined in MAJCOM guidance, or during live operations. Tasks not
     observed and assessed during the normal course of evaluation will be evaluated separately
     while the examinee is on position. When possible, the evaluation will be conducted with a
     full operational crew. Also, when possible, the evaluation will be conducted in a controlled
     radar and communications jamming environment; otherwise, radar and communications
     jamming will be simulated. The evaluation should include participation from one or more
     external TACS units and, when possible, conducted with a full surveillance crew. At least
     one Tactical Digital Information Link (TADIL) A (Link 11), B (Link 11B) or J (Link 16)
     will be used. Link events can occur on different days and/or with different agencies.
6.2. Evaluation Objective. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to accomplish all
ASO/AST duties safely and effectively IAW technical orders and applicable operations
directives.
