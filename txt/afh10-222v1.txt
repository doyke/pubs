                                    Chapter 1

                        BARE BASE DEVELOPMENT

1.1. Overview. Development of a bare base, while comprised of many tasks is
performed with one goal in mind—quickly setting up infrastructure to support
aircraft operations and other contingency missions. Engineer efforts and work
force must be focused and concentrated on the establishment of facilities,
structures and services that help bring about an initial operational capability
(IOC). Civil engineer (CE) bare base development actions relies heavily on the
use of Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) mobile assets, as well as
the type of information and procedures addressed here. This handbook contains
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for use by civil engineers in
supporting precepts outlined in Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 4-0,
Combat Support, and AFDD 3-34, Engineer Operations, and it aids in the
implementation of Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-2, Readiness. This
relationship is illustrated in the Air Force CE hierarchy of publications (Figure
1.1.). Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (Prime BEEF) team leaders,
supervisors, and other members may find this handbook useful when organizing
beddown operations, including management of beddown teams, and the
erection, construction, and repair of airfield pavements, facilities, utilities, and
other vital infrastructure.
1.2. Roles and Responsibilities. Air Force civil engineers play a key role in the
development of bare bases and the beddown of Air Force units and weapons
systems. Moreover, they are often tasked to help develop operating locations to
beddown personnel and weapons systems for joint, combined, and multinational
operations. Regardless of the military service supported or location, efficient
planning and use of available resources to erect, construct, install, and repair
expedient facilities and critical infrastructure is essential to meet initial mission
requirements. Bare base development typically involves both Prime BEEF and
RED HORSE forces, and while RED HORSE will be mentioned at times
throughout this handbook, our primary focus is on Prime BEEF support for bare
base development.

1.2.1. Prime BEEF Teams. Personnel and equipment needs vary at each
beddown or operating location. Table 1.1. lists common Prime BEEF beddown
responsibilities by team and capability. Each team has personnel and equipment
unit type codes (UTC) to support its capability. To determine actual or specific
team composition and skills, or to view other CE personnel and equipment
UTCs, refer to the Expeditionary Engineering Community of Practice (CoP)
website. Multiskilling plays an important role in engineer operations and though
personnel are generally organized around specialties and abilities, many tasks
will require more than one skill for accomplishment and many more are not
solely Air Force Specialty (AFS) unique. Requirements such as camouflage and
concealment, dispersal site construction, hardening, revetment erection, facility
erection, etc., will require more workers than is provided by any one AFS. The
main points to remember are to remain flexible and keep a mission perspective.

1.2.2. Specialized Skills. Although Table 1.1. does not list every possible CE
beddown team, the skills and knowledge possessed by members of these teams
substantiates the tremendous bare base development capability that Prime BEEF
teams bring to the fight. For some beddown requirements, however, specialized
skills and equipment may be necessary; in those cases RED HORSE forces and
specialized teams from the 49th Material Maintenance Group (MMG) and Air
Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA) Civil Engineer Maintenance,
Inspection, and Repair Team (CEMIRT), can be deployed to locations requiring
their expertise.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                           18

1.2.2.1. RED HORSE. Provides a capability for heavy civil engineering repair
and construction beyond the ability of Prime BEEF forces. They can perform
major vertical and horizontal construction and have specialized bare base
taskings. These squadrons are self-sufficient and can deploy to remote sites with
little or no outside support except for construction materials, rations, petroleum,
oils, and lubricants (POL), and other expendable type supplies. Each squadron
has its own housing, medical, food service, maintenance, and limited security
(small arms) capabilities. Their specialized capabilities include those listed in
Table 1.2.

1.3. Planning Information and Resources. Initial beddown planning and
execution at bare bases and forward operating locations require engineers have a
basic knowledge of bare base assets and their use. Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM)
10-219, Volume 5, Bare Base Conceptual Planning Guide, has additional
information on bare base planning and resources. Users should also refer to
AFPAM 10-219, Volume 1, Contingency and Disaster Planning, and the Air
Force Handbook (AFH) 10-222 Series for more information on bare base
development and beddown actions. In addition, contact the AFCESA Reach-
Back Center when seeking information not found in this publication or the
references in Attachment 1. Contact the Reach-Back Center at 888-232-3721
(comm), DSN 523-6995, or email at afcesareachbackcenter@tyndall.af.mil.
Other reach-back resources are listed in Attachment 2.

                            IMPORTANT NOTE
       The information in this handbook is for guidance ONLY. It is not
       intended to replace policy documents, technical orders and
       manuals, or any applicable mandatory procedures or instructions.
       Specialists should review applicable technical, safety, and policy
       references before performing specific tasks.

1.4. Employment. A significant amount of forethought and advance planning
occurs before bare bases are developed in any TO. In simple terms, Air Force
planners, responding to guidance from our military decision-makers, prepare
solutions to meet or satisfy specific taskings or missions. These missions are
based on Air Force distinctive capabilities or what we “bring to the fight.”
According to AFDD 4-0, one of several distinctive capabilities the Air Force
brings is Agile Combat Support or ACS; and one of ACS’s master capabilities is
to “Establish Operating Locations (EOL).” This EOL capability is the
cornerstone for the Air Force civil engineer’s bare base development mission
and although other functions share this mission, CE has a significant role when
tasked to plan, develop and sustain airfields or operating locations (OL) in
support of Air Force, joint, combined, or multinational operations.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         23

1.4.1. The Air Force organizes and deploys under the Air & Space
Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) Force Modules. Moreover, much of the
planning for bare base development usually revolves around the force module
concept addressed in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-401, Air Force Operations
Planning and Execution. The force module concept is the method used by the
AETF to standardize force packaging, and it integrates light and lean operational
and support capabilities that are scalable and flexible. It is made up of six
modules that are not executed sequentially, but rather overlap each other over
time to build the capability to support operations. As shown in Figure 1.5., the
modules are open the airbase, command and control, establish the airbase,
generate the mission, operate the airbase, and robust the airbase.
Figure 1.5. Force Modules.




1.4.2. Civil engineers, including airborne RED HORSE and those assigned to
contingency response groups (CRG), airfield assessment teams, and other small
units responsible for specific initial assessment and repair tasks will likely
deploy with the Open the Airbase force module. Then, after completing their
tasks, redeploy home to reconstitute or forward deploy to open a different site.
Prime BEEF units tasked to beddown and sustain forces at a given site typically
deploy a six-person C2 team with the Command and Control force module, with
the remainder of the tasked Prime BEEF forces deploying with the Establish the
Airbase and later modules. In general, Prime BEEF forces use their bare base
development capabilities along with expedient facilities and utilities to beddown
deploying forces. They erect engineer and services shops, billets, latrine,
laundry, dining, and other critical facilities. They also assist in the construction
or erection of personnel, vehicle, and aircraft revetments, and modify or restore
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        24

runways, taxiways, or aircraft parking areas. There may also be a minimum
cadre of engineers available to assist personnel of other base functions erect
their base facilities. Refer to Attachment 3 for a timeline of CE bare base
development and beddown tasks.
1.4.3. In addition to bare base development, civil engineers may also be tasked
to support beddown operations for other Services, such as building Army
tactical operations centers (TOC) and other structures at forward operating bases
(FOB) as shown in Figure 1.6., and may even provide support to joint,
combined, and multinational forces.
Figure 1.6. Building an Army TOC at FOB Kalsu, Iraq (2007).




1.5. Expeditionary Site Planning (ESP). ESPs are usually developed long
before Prime BEEF teams are deployed to establish bare bases or other
operating locations. AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site
Planning, states “ESPs are chiefly associated with locations without a
permanent Air Force presence and may contain only the minimum data
necessary to make initial beddown decisions. ESPs may be developed in short
periods to meet contingency needs without full staffing or coordination. It is the
installation level or site plan to support unified and specified command wartime
operations plans, as well as major command (MAJCOM) supporting plans. It
cuts across all functional support areas in a consolidated view of installation
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        25

missions, requirements, capabilities, and limitations to plan for actions and
resources supporting war or contingency operations, including deployment,
post-deployment, and employment activities (as appropriate).” This definition
suggests even when an ESP is accomplished, it may lack sufficient details to
satisfy the needs of every tasked function, and significant planning may still be
required to develop a bare base efficiently to support the incoming mission. In
any case, Prime BEEF team leaders should have as much information as
possible about factors affecting the beddown location before deploying—use
every available resource at your disposal to help ensure mission success.
1.5.1. Site Planning Resources. In addition to the ESP, Table 1.5. lists other
resources that may provide valuable information about beddown locations and
bare base development data.

1.5.2. Materiel Resources. In addition to deploying skilled personnel to a bare
base or operating location, appropriate types and numbers of systems and
materiel must also be available to develop or set up the base or location quickly
to support the operational mission. This is where BEAR mobile assets and other
bare base development materiel play a huge role.
1.5.2.1. BEAR Assets. BEAR is a critical ACS capability. It provides vital
equipment and supplies necessary to beddown and support combat forces at
expeditionary sites with limited infrastructure and support facilities. BEAR assets
are flexible, modular and scaleable to meet an array of beddown missions. It
consists of a variety of systems and equipment, such as personnel shelters,
aircraft shelters, food service facilities and equipment, hygiene facilities, power
and water production and distribution equipment, heating, air conditioning, and
refrigeration equipment, vehicles, runway lighting, vehicle maintenance
equipment, and civil engineering equipment and associated spares configured
into Mobility Readiness Spares Packages (MRSPs). When combined, these
systems and equipment make-up the infrastructure needed to establish an air
base in a deployed environment. Traditionally, BEAR assets was configured into
six materiel sets (Swift BEAR, 550 Initial/Follow-on, Industrial Operations, and
Initial/Follow-on Flightline) with a variety of Playbook Options that allow sets
to be tailored for a specific mission. However, with the advent of BEAR Order
of Battle (BOB), BEAR assets are being transformed into capability-based
configurations. These new configurations will allow Air Force and Combatant
Commanders (CCDRs) to employ only those capabilities required to meet the
mission, thereby reducing the overall logistics footprint of the previous larger
BEAR set.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        28

1.5.2.2. Other Assets. The importance of BEAR assets (including legacy
equipment sets) to bare base development is readily apparent. However, non-
BEAR assets also play an essential role. Items like non-BEAR support
equipment and vehicles, expeditionary medical, communications, and services
facilities, fuels mobility support equipment, Air Force Contract Augmentation
Program (AFCAP) and locally contracted resources, and the Army’s Force
Provider assets are just a few examples. Any of these resources can be part of
the asset mix needed to successfully develop a bare base for deploying forces.
Although our engineer workforce has a long tradition of innovative and
flexible use of available resources to satisfy command and mission
requirements, we continue to apply lessons learned and use the ever-changing
tools that improve our processes and product. For Prime BEEF forces, this
includes employment of non-BEAR assets we may encounter at expeditionary
OLs (Figure 1.7.).
Figure 1.7. Non-BEAR Water Tank Used At Operating Location.




1.5.3. Movement of Bare Base Assets. The proper flow of bare base assets into
a contingency location is critical to establishing the airbase and generating the
mission. Obtaining non-essential assets early in the logistics flow merely
congests off-load areas, increases the potential for loss or damage to items, and
does little to provide immediate mission capability. The BOB transformation
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                          29

and capabilities-based configuration of BEAR assets should remedy many of
these problems. However, as users and installers of much of the bare base
equipment, and in some cases planners for bare base contingency operations,
civil engineers have a vested interest in, and responsibility for, influencing the
flow of bare base equipment. Selection and time-phasing of BEAR and other
assets for a given site is usually determined by the theater logistics staff, with
input from the civil engineer staff. Engineers can influence the process by
working with their unit-level logistics plans office and the theater civil engineer
staff. While the planned flow of equipment can be influenced, the real-time
availability of transportation assets is a significant factor. Understanding the
pressures applied to limited airlift resources available to support all the Services’
deployment requirements, BEAR is designed with transportation flexibility in
mind. Therefore, it is being packaged in a multi-modal configuration for both air
and surface transportation. Anticipate nearly one-third of all BEAR assets to be
configured for air shipment.
1.5.4. BEAR UTCs. BEAR capabilities, in the form of UTCs, are critical to
employment planning for locations ranging from austere to main OLs depending
on specific missions, locations, and population requirements. Built with the end-
user in mind, BEAR is synchronized to other combat support UTCs to arrive as
needed to enhance the incremental buildup of an OL. As a critical enabler of the
force module construct, BEAR plays a key role in open, establish and operate
the airbase force modules.
1.5.4.1. The only BEAR UTC found in the Open the Base force module is Swift
BEAR (SB). Two of each SB UTCs are operationally linked to eight CRGs
positioned around the world. Each SB UTC includes basic hygiene, billeting,
power, lighting, water and Meals Ready-to-Eat (MREs) for an initial cadre of
150 personnel. This package normally remains in-place even if the base is
turned over to follow-on forces in the Establish/Operate the Airbase force
modules. Unlike the other BEAR UTCs, SB is configured exclusively for airlift
due to requirements to deploy with little or no notice.
1.5.4.2. BEAR UTCs in Establish the Airbase force module are synchronized
with other combat support capabilities to provide shelters, billeting, messing,
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         30

lighting, and power capabilities that arrive on or about C-day, and are designed
to provide an IOC within the first few days of arrival.
1.5.4.3. The BEAR UTCs in the Operate the Base force module includes
engineering, structural and fuels facilities necessary to complete the deployed
location layout and support quality of life activities, such as Chaplain and the
Tactical Field Exchange.
1.5.4.4. BEAR Generate the Mission UTCs support both Combat Air Forces
(CAF) and Mobility Air Forces (MAF), and contain maintenance shelters,
lighting, and aircraft supporting structures. Generate the Mission UTCs are
tasked in response to increasing numbers of aircraft to be supported. Currently,
the MAF-specific UTCs are structured to support 12 MAF aircraft at a location,
while the CAF UTCs are configured to support from 12–72 aircraft, or up to the
equivalent of three Fighter Squadrons.
1.6. Stages of Bare Base Development. There are normally four stages of bare
base development: initial, intermediate, follow-on and sustainment stages.
Beddown tasks within these stages are generally prioritized as shown in Table
1.6. During the initial and intermediate stages, most tasks will fall in the upper
two priorities. In the follow-on stage, tasks will shift more toward the lower
priorities on the list. In any case, some of the task efforts in the various stages
will overlap because of their scope or manpower requirements.
Table 1.6. General Bare Base Development Priorities.

                  Priority                  Task

1.6.4. Sustainment Stage. When the sustainment stage begins, most BEAR
support work has been completed and the engineer’s focus shifts to operations,
maintenance and upgrade activities. The extent of many of these activities will
be predicated on the anticipated duration of the deployment—this is a command
decision that should be made early in the bare base operation. Typical engineer
tasks during this period include:
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                          39

                                   SAFETY

2.1. General Safety Guidelines. Whether constructing a beddown location from
the ground up or upgrading existing facilities and infrastructure, the nature of
our business involves work that can crush, cut, pinch, burn, freeze, poison,
electrocute, suffocate, and many other ills. We must be forever vigilant to avert
injury and death caused by preventable unsafe acts and conditions. Compliance
with all technical order warnings and cautions is essential and our engineers
must wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) according to
applicable technical information and standards.
2.1.1. Published Guidance. When published guidance is available and
followed, unsafe acts and conditions can usually be avoided. Guidance comes in
many different forms, including instructions; technical orders (T.O.); technical
manuals (TM); commercial manuals; tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP);
handbooks; unified facilities criteria (UFC); engineering technical letters (ETL);
and various on-line resources. Depending on the project or task, the guidance
and instructions provided in these sources could be the difference between
success and failure. Team leaders and supervisors should ensure required
technical guidance is available for their engineer teams.
2.1.2. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). No matter how effective PPE
can be, it does not protect or benefit anyone unless it is available and properly
worn. One of the most important responsibilities of a supervisor is to ensure
their people have and wear the necessary protective equipment for the working
environment. In addition, individuals should properly use, inspect, and care for
PPE assigned to them. Personal protective equipment is mandated in specific
equipment T.O.s, TTPs, and local guidance. Attachment 4 lists PPE that may
be needed for selected CE activities according to AFOSHSTD 91-10, Civil
Engineering. For certain electrical tasks, additional Arc Flash PPE is required.
See UFC 3-560-01, Electrical Safety, O&M, NFPA 70, National Electric Code,
and Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 06-9: Arc Flash Personal Protective
Equipment (PPE) Requirements for High-Voltage Overhead Line Work at 69 kV
(Nominal) or Less, for specific requirements.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                          42

2.2. Job Hazards. Ensuring personnel observe proper safety procedures are
especially critical during bare base development. Exposure to construction,
heavy equipment, power production equipment, fuel systems, mechanical
systems, and water and waste system operations makes for a hodgepodge of job
safety hazards. Items like flammable fuels, high voltages, dangerous chemicals,
and rotating, cutting, and crushing equipment associated with these operations
are significant hazards, and adherence to all technical data warnings is critical to
avoid personal injury or death. In particular, personnel must comply with AFI
32-1064, Electrical Safe Practices, any time lethal voltages are involved. It is
also important that workers be protected against hazards such as high-pressure
subsystems and components, harmful solvents and adhesives, and infectious
black and gray water products from wastewater systems.
2.3. Basic Safety Rules. Each job or operation has its own particular safety
hazards and everyone involved must follow proper safety procedures to prevent
injury or illness. In addition to wearing required PPE, Attachment 5 lists basic
safety rules for specific CE operations and equipment according to AFOSHSTD
91-10. Ensure personnel check applicable safety standards and technical and
operator manuals for additional safety requirements before performing
operations or using equipment. Additionally, Arc Flash warning labels (Figure
2.1.) must be present on switchgear, switchboards, panelboards, disconnect
switches, industrial control panels, meter socket enclosures, and motor control
centers according to UFC 3-560-01.

                                 SITE LAYOUT

3.1. Layout Plan. Site planning and layout are critical tasks that set the stage for
the entire bare base development operation (Figure 3.1.). In a worst-case
situation where a true bare base is encountered, no existing facilities or
developed utility systems will be available. The base will fully rely on incoming
BEAR and/or other mobile assets and local resources. With limited or non-
existent infrastructure, facility and group layout often depend on the physical
layout of the terrain, tactical and operational requirements, and available
resources.

           An or ganized base layout is a cr ucial par t of a master
           plan. Poor site layout may degr ade physical health,
           r educe coor dination and cooper ation among units,
           er ode mor ale, and incr ease oper ational costs.

3.1.1. A conventional site layout for an expeditionary base is depicted in Figure

considered, support facilities, billeting, and services functions can be
progressively moved away from the flightline and industrial support functions.
If the base is long and narrow, a more linear layout may be appropriate.
Whatever the layout, the dispersed distances listed in Table 3.1. should be used
as a guide when planning and establishing essential facilities and groups.
However, improved safety and advances in materiel (i.e. smaller footprint,
reduced hazards) may decrease dispersal distances.

3.1.2. Dispersal may also play a role when protecting aircraft assets. If dispersal
of aircraft is possible and consistent with active defense measures, varied
parking patterns provide fewer lucrative targets for indirect-fire weapons.
Figure 3.3. illustrates an airfield layout that provides random, dispersed aircraft
parking areas.
Figure 3.3. Notional Airfield w/Dispersed Aircraft Parking Layout.




3.2. Facility Placement and Spacing. When facility groups are laid out, they
often impact each other. Ensure enough room is allowed in each of the facility
groups for future expansion and growth requirements (including utilities), as
illustrated in Figure 3.4. and Figure 3.5. Placement and spacing of facilities will
also influence the space available for construction of revetments and personnel
bunkers. If these requirements are not accounted for initially, the result may be
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                      47

higher risk facility configurations or a requirement to relocate utility systems.
Consult the theater engineer staff about command-specific base defense
construction standards and the potential for follow-on aircraft squadrons and
other mission beddowns. Additionally, consult Bioenvironmental Engineering
(BE) for methods to reduce or minimize base population exposures to health
hazards (noise, chemical, radiation, etc) during base development. The BE flight
conducts health-based site assessments from initial bare base development to
enduring bases.

AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                          48

3.2.1. Minimum Antiterrorism Standards. In addition to conforming to
theater-specific construction standards, expeditionary structures should comply
with minimum antiterrorism standards prescribed in UFC 4-010-01, DOD
Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Building, Appendix D, and UFC 4-020-
01, DOD Security Engineering Facilities Planning Manual. Standoff distances
and facility separation is especially critical for these structures because
hardening may or may not be possible. The following paragraphs address
standoff distances, structure separation, and facility dispersal.
3.2.1.1. Standoff Distances and Structure Separation. Standoff distances are
used to minimize the accessibility and vulnerability of a facility. These distances
are critical when siting a facility and can effectively mitigate indirect fire and
Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attacks. Structure separation requirements
are established to minimize the possibility an attack on one structure causes
injuries or fatalities in adjacent structures. The separation distance is predicated
on the potential use of indirect fire weapons. Standoff distances and separation
for expeditionary and temporary structures are listed in UFC 4-010-01 and UFC
4-010-02 (FOUO) respectively. Always refer to these two UFCs and theater
construction standards for specific requirements.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                       49

3.2.1.2. Facility Dispersal. While standoff and separations distances are
important to base defense, dispersed facility layouts also reduce risks from a
variety of threats by taking full advantage of terrain and site conditions;
therefore, nothing in the standoff distances or separation standards are intended
to discourage dispersal. However, dispersal distances may be limited by other
factors such as available resources and utilities. For example, If dispersed
facilities will be supported by utility systems (e.g. electrical, water and waste
distribution systems), appropriate adjustments must be made to the utility sizes
and quantities when site plans are changed to accommodate actual field
conditions, topography changes, and local dispersal requirements.
3.2.2. Other Layout Considerations. When reviewing the facility group
layouts, make sure everything can fit well within the real estate available and
according to facility and facility group dispersal requirements. The overall
facility/group layout should be built around a road network that provides easy
access to various points on the flightline, since much of the initial base traffic
will be operating from flightline locations. Look at the locations for utility
plants, evaporation beds, and stabilization lagoons (if required) at this time.
Ensure the locations of sewage lagoons are downwind from the base.
3.2.2.1. The locations of all large facilities, such as aircraft hangers, frame
supported tension fabric shelters or dome shelters should be marked on the site
layout map. A representative sampling of the more common medium and small
shelter systems should also be represented. A general template (and dispersal
pattern if necessary) should be provided to the survey crews who will eventually
stake out the facility groups.
3.2.2.2. Once site layout is completed, engineer survey crews must begin the
sizable task of physically marking the locations of the various bare base assets.
Use more than one crew and augment with other shop or base personnel, if
necessary. If required, survey crews should identify and mark the locations of
the mobile aircraft arresting systems and airfield lighting components.
3.2.2.3. Have crews initially mark the boundaries (corners and a few
intermediate points if distances are long) of the various facility groups. Use
markers that are relatively permanent (e.g. driven stakes) since they will become
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                            50

benchmarks for starting the location marking of individual facilities and assets.
Expedient survey methods are used during this process, for example, "walking
off" distances, using vehicle odometers, or using a hand compass for turning
angles.
3.2.2.4. Once facility groups are laid out, concentrate on locating individual
facilities within each facility group. In smaller groups (e.g., aerial port, squadron
operations, alert area, etc.), the location of all facilities can be pinpointed at one
time. In large groups, such as the billeting complex, locate only a portion of the
total requirement initially—don’t get hung up on trying to locate positions of
facilities for people who won’t be arriving for a few days. These large areas can
be marked after other more important operational portions of the base are
completed. Use expedient survey methods for laying out individual facilities as
well. Because individual facility layout is repetitious with respect to distances
between buildings, a couple of pieces of rope cut to the proper spacing intervals
can be used as a quick and accurate way of measuring and locating facility
positions.
3.2.2.5. Plan the locations of water and electrical plants and distribution systems,
in relation to facility siting, early in the site layout process. When siting and
installing contingency water systems, refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 11,
Contingency Water System Installation and Operation, and for contingency
electrical systems, refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 5, Guide to Contingency
Electrical Power System Installation.          Coordinate plans with the shop
superintendents and survey crews to optimize constructability, serviceability and
speed of initial setup. See Chapter 8 and Chapter 9, in this handbook for more
information on developing bare base utilities.
3.2.2.6. Consider location and routing of fuel distribution system during initial
facility layout. To ensure safety and fuel hose/line integrity, carefully consider
the placement of fuel lines and hoses. Strive to design road layout so fuel
lines/hoses will not cross roads. If facility expansion requires intersecting fuel
hoses/lines with roads, provide a trench with a hardened cover to protect the fuel
hose/line.

                          BARE BASE AIRFIELDS

4.1. General Information. Upgrading, modifying, or restoring an existing
airfield to full operational or mission-ready status are considerable bare base
development tasks. Even after the “Open the Airbase” phase is completed, our
Prime BEEF forces continue the enormous task of developing the airfield and
support facilities for the intended mission. Airfield development tasks include
clearing airfield hazards and obstacles, repairing pavement, installing and
repairing aircraft arresting systems, constructing revetments and berms, setting
up airfield lighting, implementing dust control measures, and many other tasks.
This chapter provides insight into these and other areas related to airfield
development.
4.2. Airfield Hazard Clearance. Clearing airfield hazards is a top priority and
usually begins during the airfield opening phase of bare base development.
Initial engineer forces, using information garnered from airfield assessments and
the situation on the ground, start clearing hazards as soon as practical after
arriving on station. Obviously, unexploded explosive ordnance or scattered
wreckage and debris on airfield pavements pose considerable hazards, and will
probably have the innate attention of both the mission commander and engineers
until the airfield is operational. When Prime BEEF forces arrive, most hazards
and obstacles in the airfield clear zones may be removed, but any remaining
hazards should be removed or mitigated early in the beddown process.
4.2.1. Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) Hazards. Whether found during force
beddown operations or recovery after an attack, the presence of UXO is a threat
to operations, installations, personnel and material. Safing and clearance of these
deadly hazards is a responsibility of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams.
EOD teams may defuse, detonate, or perform other actions to neutralize
munitions “in-place,” or they may move munitions to a nearby, isolated, and
protected location to defuse, detonate, or otherwise abate the immediate threat.
Note: Under certain circumstances, our joint and coalition partners with mine
clearing capability may assist in clearing large numbers of mines or UXO from
planned beddown areas.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                       52

4.2.1.1. During site layout, when constructing defensive fighting positions,
erecting shelters, or running utilities, expect a slower, more extended UXO
clearing process. EOD teams will clear UXO from these areas before
construction begins. Any resulting craters from in-place UXO demolition may
need to be leveled by heavy equipment operators. Once safing procedures are
completed, erection of facilities and surface layout of utilities can proceed
within the cleared areas.
4.2.1.2. Burying utilities may present additional challenges. Mines and UXO
located below the surface, especially in areas subject to flooding with drifting
soil and sand, could explode when hit or uncovered when trenching. EOD teams
may need to scan or sweep for additional UXO and mines directly along the
pathways for utility trenching.
4.2.1.3. While EOD teams are responsible for UXO clearing, other engineer
personnel may be tasked to support them. Table 4.1. lists a few tasks
augmenters may perform to support EOD activities. Using safe practices, other
wartime tasks, such as crater repairs, can begin as soon as EOD personnel have
progressed sufficiently down the airfield. Always follow EOD guidance and
seek additional information on UXO operations in the references provided at the
end of this chapter.

                                Support Tasks
         Construct protective berms around danger zones
         Provide heavy equipment support to access or remove UXO

         Reinforcing adjacent structures
         Isolating major utilities around UXO areas
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                      53

4.2.1.4. Protective Measures. Before any UXO clearance operation begins, take
measures to protect personnel and equipment by evacuating, isolating, barricad-
ing, or any combination thereof.
4.2.1.4.1. Evacuate. Adhering to Table 4.2., evacuate all nonessential personnel
and equipment in the danger zone before commencing UXO clearance
operations. Allow movement within the danger zone to essential personnel only.
Personnel who must remain in the area should wear all protective equipment
including Kevlar helmets and vests.

4.2.1.4.2. Isolate. For mission-related, operational, or other reasons, some
mission-essential personnel or equipment cannot be evacuated. To the greatest
extent possible, isolate these assets from, and limit exposure to, the immediate
vicinity of the UXO.
4.2.1.4.3. Barricade. Use barricades to protect mission-essential personnel and
equipment that must stay in the hazard area. Barricading provides limited
protection by blocking blast and fragmentation from an explosion. Suppressive
barricades (Figure 4.1.) are constructed to isolate an explosion, to deflect
thermal and shock waves and absorb low-angle, high-speed fragments. On the
other hand, Protective barricades (Figure 4.2.) are constructed around exposed
resources to shelter them from overpressure and the impact of high-angle, low-
speed fragments, which can escape over the top of “suppressive” barricades. See
AFTTP (I) 3-2.12, UXO Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for
Unexploded Explosive Ordnance Operations for more information on barricade
construction and UXO operations.

4.2.2. Wreckage and Debris Hazards. Removing wreckage and debris hazards
from runways, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas is essential to increase
airfield operability. Material initially pushed aside to establish an expedient
airfield (minimum operating strip or landing zone), or left in nonessential areas
can be removed when time and resources become available. Material may be
pushed into craters at the scene, moved to a central location for disposition, or
loaded into dump trucks and transported to a remote location for disposal.
Whatever the case, engineers must remain vigilant when using heavy equipment
and be on the lookout for UXO.
4.2.2.1. Equipment. The type of equipment needed to clear aircraft operating
surfaces depends on the size and amount of debris. The presence of large pieces
of wreckage or debris (e.g. damaged vehicles, aircraft, or pavement sections)
necessitates the use of heavy equipment such as bulldozers and cranes.
However, many of the heavy equipment items needed may not be on the first
series of incoming airlift sorties. Until these assets arrive, consider working with
the contracting officer to find local sources of heavy equipment and materials.
The following equipment items are commonly used for debris clearing
operations:
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         56

4.2.2.1.1. Crane. For removing extremely large chunks of debris, a crane may be
the only suitable piece of equipment.
4.2.2.1.2. Bulldozer. A bulldozer has the power to push large pieces of debris
out of an area and can quickly clear large areas of smaller debris. One skilled
dozer operator can clear an area that would require several hours of labor if done
by hand.
4.2.2.1.3. Front-End Loader. Front-end loaders are especially useful in loading
debris on dump trucks and other vehicles for removal from the site. They also
are adequate for clearing paved areas and streets of large amounts of small
debris.
4.2.2.1.4. Dump Truck. Dump trucks haul debris to disposal sites. Other suitable
vehicles, such as cargo trucks and tractor-trailer units, can sometimes substitute
for them.
4.2.2.1.5. Sweepers. Once larger debris is removed from an area, street sweepers
and vacuum trucks are employed to clear smaller items from aircraft operating
surfaces and primary access streets. If sweepers are not used, small metal items
left on roadways and working areas can cause tire damage to aircraft and
equipment involved in cleanup operations. Time spent repairing and replacing
flat tires on these vehicles delay the overall recovery effort.
4.2.2.1.6. Towing Devices. Steel cable, chains, hooks, and similar items can be
fashioned into towing devices for debris removal. Care must be used when
selecting towing devices to ensure they are appropriate and strong enough for
the job.
4.2.2.2. Manpower. Generally, manpower is stretched to the limit during
airfield opening operations; therefore focus available resources to clear debris
from minimum airfield operating surfaces first.
4.2.3. Airfield Obstructions. Debris is removed quickly from airfield
pavements to facilitate recovery and launch of aircraft and to accommodate
aircraft parking and loading requirements. However, obstructions along the
approach or departure ends of the runway, around ramps and taxiways, or near
the adjacent terrain may still need to be removed (Figure 4.3.). Be especially
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                       57

observant of terrain features or obstacles that could affect wing tip clearance of
wide-body aircraft. However, it may not be prudent to have crews remove items
in the outer edges of the clear zones that produce minimal danger (a culvert head
wall for example)—in these instances, airfield authorities may initially accept
the risk. Also ensure the shoulders of runways and taxiways and the grounds
along access routes to aprons and ramps are checked for potential foreign object
damage (FOD) producing areas.
Figure 4.3. Removing Destroyed Iraqi Tank near Taxiway, Iraq (2008).




4.3. Airfield Repairs and Restoration. Immediate repair and restoration may
include selection of a minimum operating strip (MOS), expedient airfield or
landing zone (LZ) marking and repairs, pavement sweeping and cleaning,
pavement marking and striping, site preparation for installation of navigational
aids (NAVAIDs), and installing airfield lighting and mobile aircraft arresting
systems (MAAS). The goal is to have the airfield ready to commence aircraft
operations as soon as possible. As soon as a minimum operating strip is
established, plan on immediately dedicating equipment and personnel to around-
the-clock airfield sweeping operations since there will likely be considerable
aircraft and vehicle traffic on pavement surfaces as bare base assets are
delivered, off-loaded and transported from ramp areas.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         58

4.3.1. NAVAIDs. Support for NAVAIDs includes clearing and leveling various
sized areas for setting up mobile communications equipment. Normally these
areas are not particularly large (2,500 sq ft or so), but plan on having to clear
and grade vehicle access ways up to 1,000 feet long to these sites and provide
electrical service. See AFPAM 10-219, Volume 5, and consult with
Communications personnel for specific siting requirements.
4.3.2. Minimum Operating Strip (MOS). By definition, the MOS is a runway
that meets the minimum requirements for operating assigned and/or allocated
aircraft types on a particular airfield at maximum or combat gross weight. When
airfield damage, unexploded ordnance, or other obstructions prevent immediate
and full use of the runway, quickly selecting a MOS for operation of mission
aircraft is essential. Minimum operating strip layout usually involves identifying
the location or layout of the areas listed in Table 4.3. See AFPAM 10-219,
Volume 4, Airfield Damage Repair Operations, for more MOS information.

4.3.3. Landing Zones (LZs). Landing zones support contingency airlift
operations for C-130 and C-17 aircraft. Potential LZ areas fall into two basic
categories: prepared and semi-prepared (unpaved). Prepared areas may include
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                       59

existing airfields, roads, highways, or other paved surfaces. Semi-prepared
surfaces are natural areas such as deserts, dry lakebeds, and flat valley floors
(Figure 4.4.). These surfaces offer the ability to construct short airstrips for a
limited use and may or may not have an aggregate surface. A lthough Prime
BEEF forces may not be involved with the initial construction of LZs, they
could be tasked with maintaining LZs if flight operations continue. Surface
maintenance may include soil stabilization, adding an aggregate course,
compacting in-place soils, or matting. See ETL 09-6, C-130 and C-17
Landing Zone (LZ) Dimensional, Marking, and Lighting Criteria, for more
information on LZs.
Figure 4.4. C-17 Lands on Semi-Prepared LZ.




4.3.4. Airfield Markings. Airfield markings must adhere to precise guidelines
that conform to recognized standards for aircraft operations as identified in AFI
32-1042, Standards for Marking Airfields, and USAF Engineering Technical
Letter (ETL) 04-2, Standard Airfield Pavement Marking Schemes. While these
standards are considered ideal under normal circumstances, it is unlikely
sufficient time will exist to restore the markings to their original condition
following an attack. The marking team must be ready to apply expedient
techniques that will mark the usable runway surface in the shortest possible time
to launch and recover aircraft in a timely fashion.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                       60

4.3.4.1. MOS Markings. MOS markings consist of threshold and centerline
pavement markings, edge markers, and aircraft arresting system location and
distance-to-go (DTG) markers. Pavement markings and markers may be used
together or independently. For the basic layouts for marking and striping a
MOS, see T.O. 35E2-6-1, Minimum Airfield Operating Surface Marking System
(MAOSMS) and AFH 10-222, Volume 16, Guide for Use of the Minimum
Airfield Operating Surface Marking System.
4.3.4.2. LZ Markings. Marking and lighting schemes for LZs are covered in AFI
13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations, and ETL 09-6, C-130 and C-
17 Landing Zone (LZ) Dimensional, Marking, and Lighting Criteria.
4.3.5. Expedient Airfield Pavement Repairs. Repairs to airfield pavements
may be needed due to war damage by our forces in a battle for the airfield;
deliberate damage the enemy did before yielding the field to our forces; poor or
substandard construction; or general disrepair due to inadequate upkeep and
maintenance. Whatever the reason, pavement repairs during the initial period of
beddown must usually be rapid in nature (e.g., compacted crushed stone, cold
mix, quick set cements, etc.), due to pressing operational need. When time
permits, the expedient repairs are upgraded to sustainment repairs to allow more
aircraft passes between maintenance of the repairs. When appropriate, upgrade
the sustainment repairs to permanent repairs.
4.3.5.1. Spall Repair. Spalls are generally defined as pavement surface damage
that does not penetrate through the pavement surface to the underlying layers
(Figure 4.5.), and less than 5 feet in diameter. As a norm, spalls are easier to
correct than crater damage, providing the number of spalls are not
overwhelming. For specific spall repair procedures, see UFC 3-270-03,
Concrete Crack and Partial Depth Spall Repair, ETL 09-2: Contingency
Airfield Pavement Specifications, and ETL 07-8: Spall Repair of Portland
Cement Concrete (PCC) Airfield Pavements in Expeditionary Environments.
4.3.5.2. Crater Repair. Craters represent damage that penetrates through the
pavement surface into the underlying base and sub grade soil, which uplifts the
surrounding pavement and ejects base, sub base soils, rock, and pavement debris
around the impact area (Figure 4.6.). Craters are more severe damage than
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                       61

spalls. Large craters have an apparent diameter equal to or greater than 6 m (20
ft). Small craters have an apparent diameter less than 6 m (20 ft). There are
several crater repair methods and newer methods are often being tested and
evaluated. For specific crater repair methods and criteria, refer to UFC 3-270-07,
O&M: Airfield Damage Repair, and AFPAM 10-219 Volume 4.
Figure 4.5. Repairing Spall Damage at Deployed Location.

4.3.6. Airfield Lighting. Airfield lighting may not be important for routine
daytime aircraft operations, but it is essential for flight in an environment with
limited visibility. Restoration of the existing permanent lighting system may not
be feasible due to the extent of damage or location of existing lighting relative to
the MOS; if this is the situation, initially install an Emergency Airfield Lighting
System (EALS). If considerable daylight will be available after anticipated ADR
operations, airfield lighting should not be immediately critical to aircraft launch
and recovery efforts; therefore, installation can be delayed so workers can be
used on higher priorities. On the other hand, if the onset of darkness or limited
visibility due to bad weather is a factor, start airfield lighting installation as soon
as possible. Procedures for installing EALS (Figure 4.7.) are provided in T.O.
35F5-3-17-1, Lighting System, Airfield, Emergency A/E82U-2, and AFH 10-222,
Volume 7, Emergency Airfield Lighting System (EALS). In most cases, the
question will be when to install the lighting system, not whether one is
necessary.
Figure 4.7. EALS Supports Contingency Airfield Lighting Requirements.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                       63

4.3.7. Perimeter and Critical Area Lighting. Portable lighting is provided in
both BEAR beddown packages and ADR equipment packages. They primarily
consist of the Remote Area Lighting System (RALS) and TF-2 Light Carts
(Figure 4.8.). However, some packages may still contain legacy lighting
systems. The RALS is used for general lighting along the flightline, around POL
or Cryogenics storage, etc. Refer to T.O. 35F5-5-22-1, Remote Area Lighting
System (RALS), for installation instructions. The TF-2 light cart is a mobile
floodlight unit used for large area lighting. It is designed primarily for initial
camp beddown, perimeter lighting and flightline use. To setup and operate the
TF-2, see T.O. 35F5-5-21-1, Flood Light, Trailer Mounted, Type TF-2.
Figure 4.8. Examples of Portable Area Lighting.




4.3.8. Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS). Provides expedient aircraft
arresting capabilities for arresting hook-equipped fighter aircraft and is capable
of up to 20 aircraft engagements per hour (Figure 4.9.). If the arresting system
is necessary, MOS layout personnel should mark its location prior to the arrival
of the MAAS installation team. Additional details regarding applications and
capabilities of this system are discussed at length in T.O. 35E8-2-10-1, Mobile
Aircraft Arresting Systems (MAAS) and AFH 10-222, Volume 8, Guide to
Mobile Aircraft Arresting System Installation.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         64

Figure 4.9. F-22 Engaging MAAS.




4.3.9. Aircraft Parking/Pavement Expansion. After meeting initial airfield
operational requirements, pavement expansions may be required to satisfy
aircraft parking and servicing requirements. Potential tasks to satisfy these
requirements include expanding aircraft parking aprons and providing special
pavement areas such as arm/de-arm pads, hot cargo pads, quick turn areas,
compass rose, wash racks, along with the accompanying tie-down anchors and
static grounding points. Existing pavements may be for some requirements;
however, if it is necessary to provide these additional areas, be sure to follow
safety distance criteria associated with them (arm/de-arm, hot cargo, etc). Also,
ensure expansion projects meet specific characteristics (e.g., size, weight, etc.)
of the supported aircraft by using the Geospatial Expeditionary Planning Tool
for automated aircraft parking plans. Refer to AFTTP 3-2.68 IP, Multi-Service
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Airfield Opening, for a list of aircraft
characteristics.
4.3.9.1. Start aircraft pavement expansions as soon as additional requirements
are known; otherwise, a massive backlog of aircraft flows and serious
congestion in material and asset movement on the ground may occur. Pavement
expansion could also be required to park incoming deployed aircraft. Contact
wing operations during the site planning process to obtain the probable numbers
and types of expected aircraft. Coordinate aircraft parking plans with
maintenance personnel. If more parking positions are needed, employ
construction techniques identified in paragraph 4.3.9.2.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         65

4.3.9.2. Expanded parking areas can be constructed next to existing aircraft
pavements using expedient techniques such as graded and compacted earth,
compacted crushed stone or AM-2 matting over a compacted subbase. Once
primarily for rapid runway crater repairs, AM-2 matting is now often used to
repair or expand aircraft parking areas and as warehouse floors. Refer to UFC 3-
270-07, for more information on AM-2 matting assembly and installation.
4.3.10. Access Roads and Drainages. Construction, maintenance, repair, and
rehabilitation of access roads and drainages are critical to airfield operations. In
essence, these roads are the installation’s arteries that support the flow of
personnel and materials needed to accomplish the mission. For information in
addition to that addressed in this section, refer to FM 5-430-00-1, Planning and
Design of Roads, Airfields, and Heliports in the Theater of Operations—Road
Design.
4.3.10.1. Access Roads. At least one access road connecting the airfield with the
existing road network is required. Bases with operations and service facilities on
both sides of a runway should have a perimeter road connected to the access
road. Connect service roads to hardstands, the control tower, service areas, fuel
storage and dispensing areas, munitions storage areas, and base camps. It may
also be desirable to provide a turnaround loop to ease vehicle maneuvers around
hardstands (including fuel storage and distribution areas). Below are other
roadway concerns:
4.3.10.1.1. General. Roads on airfields should not cross or be within the lateral
clearance distance for runways, high-speed taxiways, and dedicated taxiways for
alert pads. This prevents normal vehicular traffic from obstructing aircraft in
transit. Roads should be located so surface vehicles will not be hazards to air
navigation and NAVAIDS.
4.3.10.1.2. Firefighting and Rescue Roadways. Firefighting and Rescue access
roads shall provide unimpeded two-way access for firefighting vehicles and
equipment to incident areas (Figure 4.10.). When practical, connecting these
access roads with airfield operational surfaces and other airfield roads will
enhance FES operations.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                           66

Figure 4.10. Firefighters Responding to Vehicle Fire, Iraq (2008).




4.3.10.1.3. Fuel Truck Access. Fuel truck access points to aircraft parking aprons
should be located so minimal disruptions and hazards to active aircraft move-
ment occurs. Fuel truck access from aircraft areas to the fuel storage areas
should be separate from other vehicular traffic. Bulk fuel, truck parking, and
truck filling areas need to be as close to the flight line as is reasonably possible.
4.3.10.1.4. Explosives and Munitions Transfer to Arm/Disarm Pads. Transfer of
explosives and munitions from storage areas to arm/disarm pads should occur on
dedicated transfer roads. Transfer roads should be used exclusively for
explosives and munitions transfer vehicles.
4.3.10.2. Drainages. Drainages should be constructed and maintained for all
active roadways. Improperly channeled surface water can quickly undermine
most roads, even when they are considered well-constructed. Pending or delayed
surface water runoff can also seep into the pavement structure of paved roads if
the road surface is not tightly sealed.
4.3.11. Road Design and Construction. Air Force engineers generally design
and construct roads in the theater of operations to three standards: initial,
temporary, or semi-permanent. During contingency operations, nearly all roads
are constructed to temporary standards. In some rare cases, semi-permanent and
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                      67

permanent roads may be designed to support long-term operations. Initial and
temporary roads are usually constructed of stabilized earth or gravel, while
semi-permanent roads are typically made of asphalt with concrete turn pads.
Roads are generally constructed with a crowned driving surface and pavement
structure, a shoulder area that slopes directly away from the driving surface to
provide drainage off the driving surface, and side ditches for drainage away
from the road itself (Figure 4.11.). Refer to FM 5-430-00-1 for complete road
construction details.
Figure 4.11. Typical Road Cross Section.




4.4. Revetment and Soil Berm Construction. Revetments and berms are sim-
ple and sometimes low-tech solutions that can satisfy certain protective and
safety construction requirements. They are used primarily to protect and shield
vital facilities and equipment, suppress noise, control spills, or support waste
management activities in the theater of operations. Table 4.4. provides labor
comparisons for construction of certain revetments and soil berms. As shown,
berms are generally less labor intensive and quicker to build than some of the
more common revetment materials, especially sandbag protective structures.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        68

   high by 6.9 feet wide and 12 feet long)

   * Approximate man-hours per linear foot (mh/lf) (Ref: UFC 4-020-01)

4.4.1. Revetments. Revetments are walls or barriers generally used for base
defense purposes. They are routinely constructed using soil-filled wire and
fabric containers, prefabricated concrete barriers, or metal bins (Figure 4.12.).
However, they may also be constructed using sandbags, wooden bins, sand
grids, and even plastic bins or various other expedient methods. Preliminary
construction plans should identify the locations for the revetments, their
configuration, and a source (on-base quarry or off-base vendor) for revetment
fill material. See the Joint Forward Operations Base (JFOB) Survivability and
Protective Construction Handbook (FOUO), UFC 4-022-02, Selection and
Application of Vehicle Barriers, T.O. 35E4-170-2, Aircraft Revetment Kit, Type
B-1, AFH 10-222, Volume 3, Civil Engineer Guide to Expeditionary Force
Protection, and AFH 10-222, Volume 14, Guide to Fighting Positions,
Obstacles, and Revetments, for more information on constructing revetments.
4.4.2. Soil Berms. Soil or earthen berms have a wide range of uses. They
provide base defense as base perimeters, defensive fighting positions, traffic
control barriers, or facility hardening. They also provide safety barriers for
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                       69

landfills, burn pits, hazardous materials storage sites, and for noise abatement
and spill protection, among other things. Refer to the JFOB Survivability and
Protective Construction Handbook, UFC 4-022-02, AFH 10-222, Volume 14,
and AFPAM 10-219, Volume 2 and Volume 7, for more information on
constructing berms.
Figure 4.12. Expedient Revetments at Deployed Locations.




4.5. Raised Dikes. Raised dikes are generally used as a means to hold back
water or as a spill control measure around fuel storage and distribution areas. In
the context of bare base development, only dikes used for controlling fuel spills
will be addressed here.
4.5.1. Fuel Dikes. Referred to as either fuel dikes or fuel berms are raised dikes
around fuel storage containers designed to contain spills if tanks or bladders
rupture or catch fire. They also act as a safety barrier and base defense measure
(Figure 4.13.).
4.5.2. Engineers tasked to build fuel dikes should work closely with logistics
(fuels) specialists responsible for the design and operation of fuel distribution
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         70

systems. Consider the following when constructing dikes for Fuels Support
Equipment (FSE) refueling units:
Figure 4.13. Fuel Dikes Control Spills and Forms Protective Barrier.




4.5.2.1. The site should be reasonably level and well drained to prevent water
damage. Low areas should be avoided to prevent danger of vapor collection. The
site should not be placed in low hill areas, rolling country, uphill, or upstream
from other installations that would be in the path of escaping fuel. It should also
be free of rocks and obstructions.
4.5.2.2. The dike should be placed as close to the aircraft apron as practically
possible (Figure 4.14.). The ground should be as level as possible with a
maximum slope of three degrees to prevent the tank from creeping or crawling.
Avoid low areas to prevent accumulation of trapped vapors. Give careful
attention to receiving capabilities, such as rail cars, taxiways, and roads. If the
site is dependent on aerial bulk fuel delivery system for resupply, positioned the
area 100 feet from a parking apron.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         71

Figure 4.14. Fuel Dikes Around Jet Fuel Storage Bladders.




4.5.3. Listed below are several other factors to consider when constructing fuel
dikes for fuel storage and distribution areas. Figure 4.15. and Figure 4.16.
illustrates typical dikes or berm layouts for various sized single and multiple fuel
bladders.
4.5.3.1. The size or height of fuel dikes should be able to contain the volume of
liquid in the fuel bladder within the dike should a rupture occur. Consider
adding secondary dikes around the primary dike to catch residual or accidental
leakage and spillage due to hose/coupling breaks (Figure 4.17.). If secondary
dikes are used, the berm liner should be long enough to cover the secondary
dike.
4.5.3.2. Roads built around fuel dikes should permit fuel trucks (fueling and de-
fueling) to travel over the ground adjacent to the dike. Keep in mind most of the
trucks weigh more than 80,000 lbs. If applicable, consider civilian delivery truck
weights and turn radiuses when sizing the truck travel area. Refer to AFPAM
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        72

23-221, Fuels Logistics Planning, and T.O. 37A12-15-1, Collapsible Fuel
Bladders, for other fuel dike or berm construction details.
4.5.3.3. When setting up a bladder area, ensure all areas can be reached using a
fire-fighting vehicle with a top turret throw range of 175 feet. Minimum distance
between bladder storage areas should not exceed 150 feet.

4.6. Ditches. Ditches are generally used during bare base development to
enhance or establish proper drainage around the installation’s roads, airfield, and
facilities (Figure 4.18.), but may also be employed as an anti-vehicle barrier to
stop vehicles from penetrating the base’s perimeter. For specific ditch
construction information, refer to FM430-00-1, UFC 4-022-02, and the JFOB
Survivability and Protective Construction Handbook.

                          BARE BASE FACILITIES

5.1. Contingency Construction Standards in Theater. Having adequate bare
base facilities is essential to the success of the Air Force’s force projection
mission. Civil Engineers help provide the required infrastructure to support
planned operations and ensure an ample quality of life for base residents.
Facilities erected at bare bases must meet certain theater construction standards.
Joint Publication 3-34, Joint Engineer Operations, indicate the combatant
commander (CCDR), in coordination with Service components and the Services,
specifies the construction standards (Figure 5.1.) for facilities in the theater of
operation. Beddown or bare base construction standards generally fall into three
categories: organic, initial, and temporary construction standards.
5.1.1. Organic construction uses host nation or unit organic equipment, facilities
and labor to support deployments lasting up to 90 days. Since construction is
time-consuming and often costly, the intent is to seek an alternative to new
construction and use a minimum amount of labor and resources, until the arrival
of the full engineer capability. Minimal or no land grading or site work, tents
and pit latrines are examples of this standard. Although intended for use for up
to 90 days, organic construction may be used for up to six months.
5.1.2. Initial construction is also characterized by relatively austere facilities
and utilities that require minimal engineer effort. This construction is intended
for use during the first six months of a contingency. Wood framed tents with
flooring, latrines with sewage lift stations, tactical generators for electrical
distribution and portable refrigeration are examples of this standard. BEAR
assets are generally categorized as “initial” construction facilities. This
connotation, however, does not mean they will be totally replaced after six
months; but rather they will be used at the onset of a conflict. It is possible that
some of these assets will last several years before needing replacement.
5.1.3. Temporary construction is characterized by facilities and utilities of a
more substantial nature. It is used to increase efficiency and sustain operations
for at least 24 months and with upgrades for up to 5 years. Wood frame
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                    76

buildings, bathhouses, commercial electric power and paved roads are examples
of the temporary standard.
Figure 5.1. Contingency Construction Standards.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        77

5.2. Facility Assets and Preparation Actions. Successful BEAR facility
erection depends on several actions being carried out prior to and during the
arrival of personnel at a bare base. Some of these actions are easy to control;
others are not easily influenced. The ones easily influenced include the degree of
training the base populace has had on erecting BEAR facilities, which could
dictate the degree of involvement engineers will have in erecting facilities for
other organizations and the arrival timing and sequence of facility assets.
Always make the best of your particular situation; for purposes of this
handbook, let us assume the base populace is generally knowledgeable in
facility erection and assets flow into the base in a reasonable manner.
5.2.1. It is doubtful many people at a bare base will be able to identify all the
various BEAR facility and utility components as they arrive. Consequently,
engineers will have to accomplish this task since it is an engineer responsibility
to place most of these items in service. Supply personnel deployed in support of
BEAR help expedite assets as BEAR items arrive. These asset expediters will
assist aerial port personnel in identifying equipment, arrange to have engineer-
related items moved from the ramp area to the job site or interim holding area
and maintain asset accountability. If a supply representative from the 49th MMG
is available, they may be able to help identify BEAR assets as they arrive and
assist in maintaining accountability.
5.2.2. Identify a reasonably large open storage area immediately upon arrival at
a bare base for temporary storage and eventual longer-term storage for shipping
containers. As facility and utility assets are off loaded, they should be separated
by type of system or building and moved to the holding area or work site if
needed at the time. Any forklift-qualified personnel can assist in moving items if
necessary. Plan to have most bare base facilities delivered to the engineer
holding area, then to their final location for erection by user personnel as they
arrive. Arrange with base supply personnel to consolidate all the shipping and
storage containers (Figure 5.2.) once empty. If arrangements with supply
personnel cannot be made early in the deployment, plan on initially storing these
containers in the engineer holding area.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                            78

Figure 5.2. Arrange Storage of BEAR Shipping Containers.




5.2.3. As assets are being off loaded from incoming aircraft or vehicles, site
layout and site preparation should be well underway. Try to have enough heavy
equipment operators on the job so as not to fall way behind the site layout crews.
Obviously, this tactic is dependent on equipment availability and the number of
other heavy equipment tasks ongoing; however, the speed of facility erection is
directly related to the degree of site preparation completed. If the terrain is
relatively level, the site preparation task should go faster, if terrain is irregular,
size the heavy equipment support accordingly. Look to contract support to fill
heavy equipment gaps.
5.2.4. As site layout and preparations continue, begin delivering assets to the job
sites; plan on doing this with engineer forces. Have someone use the site layout
plan and a general list of facility allocations to oversee this effort.
5.3. BEAR Shelters.
5.3.1. Small and Medium Sized Shelters. Virtually all functional areas receive
BEAR small shelters like the Small Shelter System (SSS), so delivery of these
assets should be reasonably straightforward. On the other hand, use of the
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         79

Medium Shelter System (MSS) is unique to certain areas and must be
apportioned carefully. Deliver shelter assets as close as possible to final
locations to prevent moving them later. Pick up empty ship/store containers
when returning to the holding area after delivering assets. This keeps the base
less cluttered and protects containers from damage or misuse.
5.3.2. Large Shelters. Large shelters, such as the dome shelter, large area
maintenance shelter (LAMS), and frame supported tension fabric shelter
(FSTFS), are not erected by users, but rather Prime BEEF or RED HORSE
teams with support from the 49th MMG large structures team. These
organizations can handle the movement, unpacking, and erection of these larger
facilities since they have the requisite training and skills.
5.3.3. Miscellaneous and Legacy Shelters. Some miscellaneous and legacy
shelters still in use include the Expandable Light Air Mobile Shelter (ELAMS),
General Purpose (GP) Shelter, Expandable Shelter Container (ESC), and the
Aircraft Hangar (ACH). They are used for multiple purposes at deployed
locations worldwide.
5.3.4. From an engineer aspect, a basic premise of bare base development is that
users will erect their own facilities, thereby freeing engineer personnel for other,
more critical beddown tasks. This does not mean engineers provide no support
at all for facility erection. Plan to erect all Medium Shelter Systems—these are
probably too complex for most base organizations to handle. Plan to have a
small cadre of personnel knowledgeable on erection techniques for Small
Shelter Systems to assist the base populace. There will be occasions where
untrained people will be faced with facility erection tasks and engineers must be
prepared to offer supervisory and instructional guidance. However, base
populace must not attempt utility connections to facilities. The potential for
damage to system components and harm to both base personnel and electrical
crews is too great.
5.3.5. The facilities outlined in Table 5.1. are typically used to support various
base functional areas. However, senior personnel determine final facility
allocation locally. Make sure the base and wing command staffs are involved.
Refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 2, for details and descriptions of BEAR shelters.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         80

5.4. Services Facilities. During bare base development, Services functions
generally consist of kitchen, billeting, laundry, and mortuary facilities. While
many of these facilities use BEAR small shelter assets and are erected by
Services personnel, CE personnel erect the larger facilities, perform site
preparation, connect utilities such as power, water, and sewage, and install some
of the more complicated equipment items such as water heaters, walk-in
refrigeration units and air conditioning units.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                       81

5.4.1. Kitchens. Two types of kitchen packages are available for bare base
development, the standard BEAR 550 Kitchen and the Single Pallet
Expeditionary Kitchen or SPEK.
5.4.1.1. The BEAR 550 kitchen is a complete portable food preparation and
serving complex. It is designed to serve up to 550 personnel and seat 120
(Figure 5.3.). When siting the facility, select a site approximately 200 feet by
100 feet that is relatively level, has good drainage, is free of rocks and
underbrush, is sheltered from high winds, and accessible to the rest of the
installation. If two BEAR 550 kitchen facilities are configured to serve up to
1100 personnel, select a site that is approximately 300 feet by 300 feet. Refer to
Work Package (WP)-005 00, T.O. 35E4-169-31, BEAR Base Harvest
Falcon/Eagle Electric Kitchen with Mess Kit Laundry, for more information.
Figure 5.3. BEAR 550 Kitchen (550-Personnel).




5.4.1.2. The SPEK is a complete food service facility inside an Expandable,
Internal Slingable Container Unit (EISU). It is capable of providing hot meals to
500 personnel at a time but does not provide dining or seating space. It requires
a clear, level area; ideally, the area underneath the container must be completely
clear of all stones and branches, and it must not be placed on any depressions or
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                           82

sharply raised areas. See T.O. 35E4-235-1, Single Pallet Expeditionary Kitchen,
for siting and assembly information.
5.4.2. Billeting (Lodging). Billeting facilities generally utilize small and
medium shelter systems from BEAR housekeeping packages for personnel
shelter, showers and latrines, offices, laundries, and storage. However, in some
instances, other shelters (including legacy assets) may be used.
5.4.2.1. Personnel Shelters. The bulk of personnel shelters are comprised of
small shelter systems. These shelters should be sited and erected as discussed
earlier in this chapter. It is a good idea to obtain a lodging facility breakout list
from Services personnel before siting these facilities. The group breakout list
identifies any personnel groups that must be within contiguous billeting blocks
(examples: flight crews, officers, females, and foreign military). Table 5.2. lists
typical breakout groups. The number of personnel planned for each group could
affect the layout plan. Spacing and distance for these personnel shelters should
be according to specifications in UFC 4-410-01, DOD Minimum Antiterrorism
Standards For Buildings.

AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        83

5.4.2.2. Showers and Latrines. Portable shower and latrine facilities are
included in BEAR housekeeping and flightline operations packages. They are
usually housed in small shelter systems and should be sited on a relatively level
surface that is free of debris. Refer to T.O. 35E35-5-1, Field Deployable Latrine
Assembly, T.O.35E35-4-1, Shower Facility Bare Base, and T.O. 35E35-3-1,
Shave Stand Bare Base, for more information.
5.4.3. Self-Help Laundry. The self-help laundry (Figure 5.4.) is designed for
rapid deployment and continuous operation as an efficient field laundry system.
The site selected for the laundry facility should be relatively level with adequate
drainage. Laundry equipment requires approximately 75 square feet of space
inside a small shelter system or legacy tent. Consult T.O. 50D1-4-1 or 50D1-4-
11, Self-Help Laundry, for more information.
Figure 5.4. Self-Help Laundry (SHL).




5.4.4. Mortuary. Most field mortuary operations can use a small shelter system
for mortuary collection point (MCP) operations (Figure 5.5.). The site also
requires the Advanced Design Refrigerator, 300 Cubic Foot (ADR-300), or
legacy 150-cubic foot refrigerators for refrigerated storage. The site and facility
should be located away from other facilities. It may require a power generator if
normal site power is not available during processing. The MCP should also have
ample area lighting, a water supply, access for truck and forklift operations,
good drainage and runoff protection, and ventilation. Depending on the location
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         84

and temperatures, an ECU may be needed during processing. A contaminated
waste collection point may also be necessary.
Figure 5.5. Field Mortuary Operation Set Up In Small Shelter System.




5.5. Non-BEAR Facilities. Non-BEAR facilities come in all shapes and sizes
and may be from various sources. They may be special field-deployable medical
systems, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) items, deployable assets from other
Services, locally manufactured structures, or pre-designed facilities constructed
from the ground up using Class IV construction materials. Whatever the source,
Prime BEEF forces are building and supporting bare base and force beddown
facilities and structures around the world for Air Force, joint, combined, and
multinational operations.
5.5.1. Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) Facilities. Expeditionary
medical and dental facilities provide an essential resource to treat (and evacuate,
if necessary) casualties under all conditions. These facilities generally utilize
SSS or Multipurpose Tent System (MPTS). However, other shelters may also be
employed. The EMEDS (Figure 5.6.) are expandable equipment packages that
range from a basic, rapid response facility to an Air Force Theater Hospital
(AFTH). While medical personnel are trained and experienced in erecting
medical facilities, deployed civil engineers provide significant beddown support
for these facilities. EMEDS facilities require specific siting and utility
requirements. Medical units should be situated in lower threat areas of the base
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                          85

but as near as practical to force support facilities such as billeting, showers and
laundry. In addition to performing site preparations and providing basic utilities
like heat, electric, and water, engineers should also consider these factors: (a)
emergency back-up power needs; (b) oxygen and vacuum lines, if required; (c)
refuse and medical waste disposal requirements; (d) room for possible expansion
of MTF facilities; (e) adequate access roads; (f) areas for erection of a radio
antenna/satellite; (g) location of latrines (should be in close proximity), and (h)
flightline accessibility (incoming/outgoing aeromedical patients).
Figure 5.6. Expeditionary Medical Support Facility.




5.5.2. Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Facilities. When required,
commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) building systems are procured to meet specific
mission requirements. These facilities are usually frame, fabric, and/or steel
structures that can be erected rapidly, are cost effective, and generally have a life
span that exceeds theater temporary construction standards. These facilities are
used as aircraft sunshades and hangars, maintenance buildings, warehouses, and
other purposes. While commercial contractors may construct some of these,
engineers will likely be required to maintain and repair these facilities. If the
facilities are portable, like the aircraft sunshade in Figure 5.7., Prime BEEF
personnel may be tasked to relocate these structures to satisfy operational
requirements.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                          86

Figure 5.7. Engineers Relocate Aircraft Sunshades.




5.5.3. Force Provider Facilities and Equipment. Army beddown facilities and
equipment (referred to as Force Provider) will likely be encountered when
deployed to a joint environment, and engineer work crews could be tasked to
help beddown troops using these facilities. In some instances, work crews may
need to complete site preparation, build access roads, and provide water and
power to these facilities. In other situations, crews may be required to erect these
facilities. Force Provider assets are similar to Air Force BEAR and legacy
equipment assets (Figure 5.8.), but there are some variations, and workers
should review applicable technical manuals before erecting or maintaining these
assets. As shown in Table 5.3., some examples where Force Provider assets
differ from BEAR assets includes power production equipment, Reverse
Osmosis Water Purification Units (ROWPUs), and latrine and shower units. In
addition, there are some differences in the water distributions systems, field
laundry configurations, and methods for collecting and treating gray water.

5.5.4. Pre-Designed Theater-Constructed Facilities. There are numerous, pre-
designed initial, temporary, and semi-permanent facilities intended for
OCONUS contingency operations. They include barracks, latrines,
administrative areas, hospitals, storage and distribution facilities, and many
others. In today’s joint environment, Prime BEEF work crews are often tasked
to build these and other pre-designed structures (Figure 5.9.). Engineering data
for pre-designed, theater-constructed facilities are located on the Army Facilities
Component System (AFCS) website at www.tcms.net. The AFCS website
offers design plans and provides two and three-dimensional drawings of various
facilities. Additionally, a 360-degree animated fly-through of selected facilities
is available so builders can see what the structure looks like before it is
constructed.
Figure 5.9. Building Army Shower Facilities at an FOB.




5.6. Cryogenics Facilities. Cryogenics (Liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen)
storage and servicing facilities (Figure 5.10.) have specific siting requirements
and should be part of initial base planning. Air Force Occupational Safety and
Health Standard (AFOSHSTD) 91-67, Liquid Nitrogen and Oxygen Safety, lists
siting and safety requirements for liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid nitrogen (LIN
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        89

or LN2) facilities. Because of the special hazards associated with LOX and LIN,
exercise care when siting these facilities. A paved road is required to and from
the facility for delivery, maintenance, and emergency vehicles according to AFI
23-201, Fuels Management, and the area around the Cryogenics facilities where
spills are most likely to occur (i.e., storage tanks, receiving and servicing area,
and servicing cart parking areas) should be concrete with non-petroleum based
sealant between the joints. Utility services (water, electricity and sewage) should
also be coordinated with the installation civil engineer.
5.6.1. LOX storage facilities having a capacity of 100 gallons or more will
conform to the minimum separation distances in AFOSHSTD 91-67 (shown in
Table 5.4.), and the facility must be permanently placarded to indicate
“OXYGEN-NO SMOKING-NO OPEN FLAMES” or an equivalent warning.
5.6.2. Further information can be found in the Air Force 32-series publications
(Civil Engineering) and T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static
Grounding/Bonding. Additionally, consult AFI 23-201, for information on
security fencing and lighting requirements.

        EXPEDIENT HYGIENE AND SANITATION FACILITIES

6.1. Expedient Field Facilities. Sometimes during contingencies or in the early
stages of bare base deployments, deployable hygiene and sanitation kits may not
be readily available. Additionally, even when BEAR assets begin to arrive, there
may be some locations on the base that still need expedient facilities because
certain areas may be too far from main utility networks or the quantity of
deployable assets may be insufficient to cover all worksites. In most cases,
engineer support will be required to construct various types of field hygiene and
sanitation facilities (Figure 6.1.). Expedient facilities could include any of the
following: latrines, urinals, hand-washing stations, shower and shaving stations,
and water-heating or mess kit cleaning devices. Construct these facilities when
no other practical options are available or permitted. In addition to procedures
addressed here, refer to FM 21-10, Field Hygiene and Sanitation, AFH 10-222,
Volume 4, Environmental Guide for Contingency Operations, and AFPAM 10-
219, Volume 5 and Volume 7, for additional details on expedient hygiene and
sanitation facilities.
Figure 6.1. Field Expedient Latrine Often First Sanitation Facility.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                          92

6.2. Expedient Latrines. Expedient latrines are basic versions of either pit or
above-ground drum type latrines. They are normally collocated with urine tubes
and hand-washing stations. Even commercial portable latrines like that shown
next to the hand-constructed latrines in Figure 6.2. can be considered a drum
type latrine because it must be emptied after some period of use—albeit by
contractor personnel. In general, expedient latrines are intended for temporary
use until suitable facilities are erected or an existing sanitary sewer system is
being rehabilitated. See Attachment 6 for the pros and cons of the various types
of expedient field latrines.
Figure 6.2. Commercial Latrines Used Alongside Field Latrines.




6.2.1. Pit Latrines. Normally there will be a central latrine within the camp or
beddown area. The number of latrines and locations will increase as the
population grows. Basic pit latrines consist of digging a pit with a minimum
depth of six (6) feet and providing various convenient facilities for depositing
human waste. Often the earth removed from the pit is placed next to the pit so
waste can be covered with earth periodically to control insects and odor.
Normally, when the pit is filled to within three (3) feet of the surface, a new pit
is dug and the old pit is covered with the remaining soil, treated with insecticide,
and appropriately posted closed. Once closed, immediately remove latrine
structure from over the pits and update base maps to show location of closed
pits. The types of pit latrines presented in this section are limited to areas where
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         93

the groundwater table is deep enough to prevent groundwater contamination or
water standing in the latrine pit. They are also limited to areas that are free of
impervious rock formations near the surface. Several alternatives are available
for locations where a high groundwater table or a rock formation near the
surface prevents digging a pit of adequate depth. Examples are presented in
paragraph 6.2.2.
6.2.1.1. Straddle Trench Latrine. A common type of multiple-user pit latrine
for temporary use (one to three days) is the straddle trench or straddle-pit latrine
(Figure 6.3.). A straddle trench latrine is usually dug 1 foot wide, 2 1/2 feet
deep, and 4 feet long. In this configuration, it will accommodate two people at
the same time. Another version of the straddle trench latrine with individual pits
and privacy partitions is shown in Figure 6.4.
6.2.1.1.1. As shown in both figures, there are no seats with this type of latrine.
Instead, boards may be placed along both sides of the trench to provide better
footing. Place toilet paper on a suitable holder and protect it from inclement
weather with a tin can or other covering. Remove the earth and pile it at the end
of the trench so each individual can properly cover his excreta and toilet paper.
Figure 6.3. Straddle Trench Latrine without Partitions.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                           94

Figure 6.4. Straddle Trench Latrine with Partitions.




6.2.1.2. Bored Hole Latrine. A bored-hole latrine consists of a hole that is
about 18 inches in diameter and 15 to 20 feet deep. As indicated in Figure 6.5.,
a one-hole latrine box covers it. The actual diameter is not critical, and is usually
determined by the size of the largest available auger. A metal drum (with both
ends removed) placed into the ground serves as a box. A fly proof seat cover
with a self-closing lid is fitted for the top of the drum. An 18-inch high wooden
box is sometimes used when a metal drum is not available. A bored hole latrine
is satisfactory for small groups.
Figure 6.5. Bored Hole Latrine.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                          95

6.2.1.3. Deep Pit Latrine. The deep pit latrine is used for longer periods of time
and in built-up areas. As shown in Figure 6.6., it is used with a latrine box. The
standard latrine box has four seats, and is 8 feet long and 2 1/2 feet wide at the
base. A unit of 100 men requires two four-seat latrine boxes. To prevent flies
from breeding and to reduce odors, keep the latrine box clean, the seat lids
closed, and the cracks sealed. Maintain a good fly control program in the area.
Applying lime to the pit contents or burning it does not effectively control flies
or odor. The box and latrine seats should be scrubbed with soap and water daily.
Note: If the ground is too hard for digging, or if the water table is too high, use a
pail latrine or a burnout latrine instead.
Figure 6.6. Deep Pit Latrine.




6.2.1.4. Mound Latrine. As illustrated in Figure 6.7., a dirt mound makes it
possible to build a deep-pit latrine without the pit extending into water or rock.
The mound latrine should be fly-proofed and enclosed as described for deep pit
latrines. Note: The size of the mound base depends on the type of soil in the
area. A larger mound will be likely be required if the slope is steep. It may also
be necessary to build steps up a steep slope.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                           96

Figure 6.7. Mound Latrine.




6.2.1.5. Cat Hole Latrine. The simplest of all field human waste disposal
devices is the cat hole latrine (Figure 6.8.). This latrine is used by individuals on
the move or when on patrol (if individual waste collection bags are not
available) and is covered immediately after use. It is also used in situations when
individual chemical toilets and other latrine facilities are not available. After
use, replace and repack the removed soil.
Figure 6.8. Cat Hole Latrine.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         97

6.2.1.6. Cross Tree Latrine. Another very basic latrine is the cross tree type
(Figure 6.9.). One latrine will usually serve the needs of 6 to 8 people. As might
be expected, the latrine is situated downwind from the encampment area, but not
so far from the shelters as to encourage individuals to break sanitary discipline.
In areas where it is difficult to dig a pit, ration boxes or similar material should
be used to collect waste. A urinal, designated for each shelter, should also be
located within 4 to 5 meters (4 to 5 yards) of the shelter. A windbreak of boughs,
tarpaulins, ponchos, or snow wall can be constructed to provide both privacy
and protect the latrine from the wind.
Figure 6.9. Cross Tree Latrine.




6.2.2. Drum and Pail Latrines. Drum and pail latrines are often used when the
groundwater table is high and ground-water contamination or water standing in
the latrine pit is probable. They are also ideal when an impervious rock
formation is close to the surface, preventing adequate dispersal of liquids.
6.2.2.1. Burn Out Latrine. A burn out latrine is particularly suitable for areas
with high groundwater tables. It is also useful in desert regions where an
impervious rock layer lay a short distance under the sand. When using this
technique, ensure the burning location is downwind of the base camp. For a unit
of 100 men and 100 women, at least eight men's latrines and eight women's
latrines are needed. As illustrated in Figure 6.10., a 55-gallon is used for a basic
burn out latrine drum (sometimes cut in half to make two latrines). Handles are
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         98

welded to the sides of the drum so two people can carry it with ease, because
drums must be moved before the contents are burned. Have two sets of drums, if
possible, so one set can be used while the other set is being burned out.
Encourage male personnel to urinate in a urine disposal facility rather than a
burn out latrine because more fuel is required to clean a latrine with a liquid
content. Burn the contents of each drum daily by adding sufficient fuel to
incinerate the fecal matter. Do not use highly volatile fuel because of its
explosive nature. A mixture of 1-quart of gasoline to 5 quarts of diesel oil is
effective; nevertheless, use it with caution. Burn the contents again if they are
not rendered dry and odorless in one effort. Once the burning process is
complete, bury the residual ash.
Figure 6.10. Basic Burn-Out Latrine.




6.2.2.2. Pail Latrine. Pail latrines can be used when conditions (populated
areas, rocky soil, marshes) are such that a latrine cannot be dug. A standard,
deep pit latrine box is used with a pail under each seat (Figure 6.11.). Urinals
should also be available in male latrines with a drainpipe leading to a pail
outside. Pails should be cleaned at least once daily and bury or burn the contents
or dispose of them by another sanitary method.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                          99

Figure 6.11. Pail Latrines.




6.2.2.3. Portable Latrines. If access to BEAR or similar latrine assets will be
delayed during a sizeable deployment or beddown activity; the more substantial
portable latrine may serve large groups better than some of the expedient options
discussed previously in this chapter. Portable latrines vary, however all are built
on the same basic precepts of mobility, adequate ventilation, proper sanitation,
and reasonable privacy.
6.2.2.3.1. Portable Pit Latrines. For portable pit latrines (Figure 6.12.), once the
supporting pit is filled, the latrine is simply relocated to another spot, usually in
the same vicinity, and the old pit is then filled and closed as discussed
previously.
6.2.2.3.2. Portable Burn-Out Latrine. Similar to the portable pit latrine, the burn-
out latrine variation (with access doors in the rear for removing drums) depicted
in Figure 6.13. can easily be relocated as needed to accommodate facility
expansion or to support remote areas.

6.3. Expedient Urine Disposal Facilities. There are several good reasons to
construct separate male urine disposal facilities. One of the more important rea-
sons is to limit the amount of liquid content that accumulates in expedient drum
(burnout) or pail latrines. As mentioned previously, waste containers with a high
liquid content require more fuel to burn and must be cleaned more frequently
than those containing less liquid content. In addition, separating male urine fa-
cilities from toilets will help prevent soiling toilet seats and the immediate areas.
At least one urine disposal facility is required for each male latrine or per 100
personnel. Below are some examples of expedient field devices used for the
disposition of urine. Each facility incorporates a soakage pit to dispose of urine.
As a general rule, urinals should always be situated either in or very near latrines
that are used by male personnel.
6.3.1. Pipe Urinal. The pipe urinal is one of the most common expedient urine
disposal methods. It may be constructed as a single unit or multiple units as
shown in Figure 6.14. and Figure 6.15. Privacy screens should be used where
appropriate.
Figure 6.14. Single Pipe Urinal with Privacy Screen.

Figure 6.15. Multiple Pipe Urinal Illustration With Soakage Pit.




6.3.2. Trough Urinal. If materials are available and facilities that are more
permanent are desired, a trough urinal can replace pipe urinals. The trough
urinal is normally U-shaped or V-shaped and made of sheet metal or wood
(Figure 6.16.). Another expedient trough urinal variation is shown in Figure
6.17.
Figure 6.16. Basic Trough Urinal.

Figure 6.17. Variation of Basic Trough Urinal.




6.4. Expedient Hand-Washing Station. Simple hand-washing devices must be
available at field latrine locations. These devices should be easy to operate and
have a constant supply of water. As previously mentioned, the importance of
hand-washing devices must be given aggressive emphasis because hands
contaminated with fecal material are a common means of disease transmission.
An expedient hand-washing station can be constructed rather quickly using
material that is readily available like that shown in Figure 6.18. and Figure
6.19. However, stations that are more durable can be assembled using Lyster
bags and water cans (Figure 6.20.).
Figure 6.18. Simple and Effective Hand Washing Device.

Figure 6.19. Basic Arrangement of Expedient Hand Wash Station.




Figure 6.20. Other Types of Expedient Hand Wash Stations.




6.5. Expedient Shower and Shave Facilities. Although very important to
hygiene, sanitation and quality of life, shower and shave facilities do not
represent the critical requirement that latrines do. Recent operations have shown
that shower/shave kits will be bumped by higher priority assets for daily intra-
theater airlift. Therefore, engineers should be ready to construct field expedient
shower and shave facilities with any construction material that may be available
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                      105

locally. If it is known in advance that showers will be a high priority, pack
enough Class IV construction material to build rudimentary showers until BEAR
assets arrive. Expedient field showers and washing devices, including various
types of water-heating devices, are generally collocated with a base camp to
support residents. Engineer personnel are usually responsible for the installation
and upkeep of these devices to include disposition of the resulting wastewater.
6.5.1. Expedient Showers. When it comes to bathing in the field, showers have
many advantages over bathtubs. Specifically, they use a lot less water and afford
much better sanitation. Each field shower will require a soakage pit or trench to
absorb discarded water. Figure 6.21. is an example of an expedient field
shower. Note: In some climates, heat from the sun will take the chill from
shower and bath water (painting water containers black can absorb more heat
from the sun).
Figure 6.21. Expedient Field Shower Facility.




6.5.2. Expedient Shave Station. The likelihood that an expedient shave station
would be needed during a bare base deployment is probably remote. However, if
needed, a skilled craftsman can easily improvise a shave stand made of wood
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        106

with accompanying water can or bucket in very little time. Figure 6.22.
illustrates how a basic shave station may look. If the station will be used heavily
or for an extended period, the addition of a soakage pit to dispose of discarded
water and a grease trap to prevent the premature clogging of the pit will be
necessary.
Figure 6.22. Expedient Shave Stations.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         107

                            PEST MANAGEMENT

7.1. General Information. Control of insects, rodents, and associated vermin is
important during force beddown. These pests carry disease and quickly spread
contamination throughout the airbase if left uncontrolled. The CE pest
management team performs critical tasks that help preserve the health and
welfare of deployed forces. Primarily, they provide entomological services to rid
an installation of pests and help maintain a healthy work and rest environment
under austere conditions (Figure 7.1.). This task includes more that the sensible
use of pesticides, but rather a comprehensive, integrated pest management (IPM)
program. The IPM approach combines a variety of techniques--including
physical, mechanical, educational, biological and chemical--to prevent medical
injury or economic damage from pests and disease vectors.
Figure 7.1. Judicious Application of Pesticides Help Control Insects.




7.2. Guidance and Resources. Although AFI 32-1053, Integrated Pest
Management Program, implements DOD and Air Force pest management
policies, it generally applies to Air Force installations in the United States and
its territories. For installations outside the United States and its territories, the
Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD), the Final
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                      108

Governing Standards (FGS) for the host country, or theater specific
requirements take precedence. The Armed Forces Pest Management Board
(AFPMB) is also an important resource. It provides, collects, stores and
disseminates published and unpublished information on arthropod vectors and
pests, natural resources, and environmental biology important to the DOD.
Other products include technical guides (TGs) and country- or region-specific
Disease Vector Ecology Profiles (DVEPs), like that illustrated in Figure 7.2. for
Afghanistan and the South Central Asia region. The AFPMB TG No. 24,
Contingency Pest Management Guide, provides basic information on using
pesticides to control insects that transmit disease and other pests during field
situations worldwide. Information from TG-24 is used extensively in this
section. See the AFPMB web site at http://www.afpmb.org for this and other
contingency-related entomological information.
Figure 7.2. Disease Vector Ecology Profiles (DVEPs).
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        109

7.3. Safety. When working with pesticides and pest management equipment,
safety is paramount. A dangerous temptation during contingency operations is to
relax safety requirements. Some people think, “The rules don’t apply here.”
Yielding to that temptation can cost you your health and the health of those
around you. Table 7.1. lists some general safety requirements and precautions
that should be observed.
Table 7.1. General Pest Management Safety Checklist.

                         Item or Activity                            Yes    No
  Are pesticides only used as part of an IPM program?
  Is proper PPE on hand and utilized IAW pesticide label?
  Do workers adhere to safety requirements and restrictions on
  pesticide labels?
  Do workers follow all directions, restrictions, and warnings for
  protecting the general population and non-target organisms?
  Are empty pesticide containers rendered “UNUSABLE” and
  properly disposed as per label?
7.4. Sanitation. Good sanitation and proper waste disposal under contingency
conditions are the most important principals in combating diseased pests such as
filth flies and rodents. Even in mobile field situations, these pests have
historically amplified sanitation problems, often causing epidemics of diarrheal
diseases. This threat is even greater in urban areas converted to temporary or
semi-permanent military use because personnel will not move every day to a
different, cleaner area. In this situation, cockroaches may join other pests
associated with poor sanitation in compounding the problem, especially in and
around structures used for food storage, preparation and consumption, and
buildings used for troop housing. All these pests must be controlled, but only in
conjunction with efforts to correct the sanitation problems that provide them
food, breeding areas, and harborage. Successful pest control requires good
sanitation practices be established and maintained. You can't control pests with
pesticides alone.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                     110

7.5. Contingency Pesticides. As previously addressed, the ideal means of pest
control is good sanitation and proper disposal of waste materials and garbage.
Sometimes that may not be enough to control the pest population, and
extermination may be required. Insects are controlled by spraying an insecticide
in and around nesting and feeding areas and fogging or spraying throughout the
installation. Rodents are controlled with poison baits, trapping, and sealing
access points (Figure 7.3.). The pesticides found on the AFPMB contingency
pesticide list are suitable for contingency use by one or more of the Military
Services. A current list is posted to the AFPMB web site at
http://www.afpmb.org/standardlist.htm.
Figure 7.3. Using Traps to Control Rodent Population.




7.6. Using Pesticides in Foreign Countries. Different rules concerning the
application of pesticides may apply in areas outside the jurisdiction of the
Environmental Protection Agency. The DOD should follow the FGS for
installations in each host country or applicable theater requirements—whichever
takes precedence. For NATO operations, STANAG 2048, Chemical Methods of
Insect and Rodent Control, provides a list of pesticides approved for use by
member nations. See AFPMB TG-24 for additional guidance on use of
pesticides during contingencies.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                      111

7.7. Emergency Procurement of Pesticides/Pest Management Equipment.
Deploying forces often need pesticides and equipment on short notice. The
Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has established an Emergency Supply
Operations Center (ESOC) to provide equipment and supplies to deploying
forces with urgent requirements and in a timely manner. Use the contact
information in Table 7.2. The most current list of pesticide dispersal and
surveillance equipment is found on the DOD Pest Management Material list.
All items may be suitable for contingency use by one or more of the military
Services. The list contains the most current products and prices.

7.8. DOD Pesticide Hotline. The DOD Pesticide Regulatory Action System
(DOD PRAS) provides the pesticide hotline service as a DOD-wide source for
all pesticide-related information and enables DOD personnel to obtain
information on pesticide labels, Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), recent
pesticide regulatory actions, and pesticide use and disposal information. Pre-
deployment units can utilize this service to determine the current availability of
approved pesticides in the military supply system and to receive
recommendations on the availability and suitability of non-standard pesticides
for use in the deployed areas. Contact the DOD Pesticide Hotline at (410) 436-
3773/DSN: 584-3773, Email at pesticide.hotline@amedd.army.mil.
7.9. Contingency Pesticide Storage. Pesticide storage areas should be isolated
from congested areas for reasons of health and safety, fire protection,
environmental protection, and security (Figure 7.4.). The most compelling
reason for the isolation of pesticide storage facilities is the fire safety. If a fire
occurs in a facility located within or adjacent to an office complex, extensive
decontamination of nearby areas from drift of toxic vapors, smoke, liquids, and
particulates is required. Designated pesticide storage areas are essential to safely
protect and store pesticides and related chemicals. See AFPMB TG-24 for
additional guidance.
Figure 7.4. Isolated Pesticide Storage Facility at Deployed Location.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                      113

7.10. Transporting Pesticides. Vehicles used to transport pesticides should be
single use vehicles and clearly identified as vector control vehicles. If vehicles
cannot be designated single use, vehicles used to transport pesticides will NOT
be used to transport food, water, or medical supplies. Vehicles will be
maintained with a clean and orderly appearance, free from observable pesticide
spills, or residues. Vehicles used to transport pesticides will be equipped with a
fire extinguisher and a spill kit capable of handling the maximum amount of
pesticide transported at any given time.
7.11. DOD Repellents. The best strategy for defense against disease-bearing
arthropods includes the application of extended-duration DEET lotion to
exposed skin, coupled with the application of permethrin to the field uniform.
When used with a properly worn uniform, this system will provide nearly
complete protection from arthropod-borne diseases. Additional information on
repellents and their application is available in the AFPMB TG 36, “Personal
Protection Measures Against Insects and Other Arthropods of Military
Significance.”
7.12. Controlling Vegetation with Herbicides. There are specific limits
imposed on the use of herbicides during wartime and peacetime, inside and
outside the United States. According to Executive Order 11850, Renunciation of
Certain Uses in War of Chemical Herbicides and Riot Control Agents, 8 April
1975, the United States has renounced first-use of herbicides in war except
under regulations applicable to their domestic use on bases or for control of
vegetation around the immediate defensive perimeters of bases. Only the
President of the US may authorize other wartime uses. Make sure any use of
herbicides is according to established procedures and limits.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        114

                 WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS

8.1. General Information. Establishing a viable water and wastewater system is
essential to the success of deployed military operations. It has a direct impact on
the health, welfare, and morale of the troops. The Air Force’s contingency water
system (aka BEAR Water System) fulfills both potable water and wastewater
recovery needs at austere locations (Figure 8.1.). The water system provides
water to support kitchens, latrines, showers, laundries, and other bare base
facilities and recovers the wastewater for appropriate disposal. Besides the
information addressed here, refer to T.O. 40W4-21-1, Basic Expeditionary
Airfield Resources (BEAR) Water System, AFH 10-222, Volume 11,
Contingency Water System Installation and Operation, and UFC 3-240-02N,
Wastewater Treatment Systems Augmenting Handbook, for information on
setting up contingency water and wastewater systems. Additionally, consult
Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) in design and development of drinking
water systems/processes. The BE flight plays an instrumental role in drinking
water quality, treatment, and vulnerability.
Figure 8.1. Typical Contingency Water System Components.




8.1.1. Water Consumption. Water consumption is based on the size of the
deployed force and its consumption requirements. Joint Publication 4-03, Joint
Bulk Petroleum and Water Doctrine, describes essential water requirements as
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                   115

drinking, personal hygiene, field feeding, medical treatment, heat casualty
treatment, personal contamination control, patient decontamination in CBRN
environments, and in arid regions, vehicle and aircraft maintenance. When
requirements exceed production, all but essential consumption should be
reduced. Air Force engineer panels have determined that when mobile water
treatment and distribution assets are used, the water-use planning factor is 30
gallons per person per day (gpppd) at a bare base. If a permanent water
treatment plant and adequate storage capability are available at the beddown
location, a 60-gpppd factor may be used. A breakdown of the 30-/60-gpppd
planning factor is shown in Table 8.1.

8.1.2. Wastewater Estimates. Since potable water is often viewed as the most
essential element to bare base operations, the disposal of wastewater and other
wastes may seem to be of lesser importance. On the contrary, unless wastes of
all types are quickly and properly disposed of, unsanitary conditions may
quickly develop. Flies, mosquitoes and rodents can overwhelm a bare base,
spreading disease with them. The wastewater disposal elements of the BEAR
water system use the same concept as a typical municipal wastewater system.
Wastewater is collected and transported via hoses to a centralized treatment
area. The wastewater receives the equivalent of secondary treatment before
being discharged for disposal. Setting up this system takes time. Until the BEAR
water system is operational, wastewater should be picked up at the point of
generation by wastewater removal trailers. These trailers are discharged away
from the base or into the lagoon system if one is available. Of the 30 gpppd of
potable water provided at a bare base for initial beddown, about 21 gpppd (70
percent) will become wastewater. The information in Table 8.2. provides
estimated quantities of wastewater generated in a given area.

8.1.3. Water Sources. Available water source has a significant impact on water
system development. For example, is the water fresh, brackish, or salt water?
Does it come from a well, river, lake, ocean, or municipal water supply? How
far is the water source from the base? What is the water temperature? These
factors determine how much effort and equipment is needed to capture and treat
the water during the initial beddown period. In some instances, a road may need
to be cleared to the water source or an expedient water intake system may need
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        117

to be set up. Even building a temporary dam to create an expedient reservoir
could possibly be required. In any case, once the source location is made usable,
install and use raw water pumps to retrieve the water (Figure 8.2.). If the water
production plant will not be located near the water source, it may be necessary
to fill bladders, tanks, or other water vessels for transport to the site chosen for
the water plant (Figure 8.3.).

8.2. Initial Water Production. Providing essential water to support the
anticipated base population and projected mission is a priority-1 task.
Complicating the situation somewhat is the fact that the entire contingency
water system package is unlikely to arrive at one time early in the deployment.
An initial water production package (consisting of two ROWPUs, storage
bladders, pumps, hoses, fittings, and power source for standalone operation) is
usually the first BEAR water production items received (Figure 8.4.). If the
source water is located over 500 feet from the anticipated water production
location, a Source Run subsystem package may also be included with the initial
water package. Take immediate steps to develop water sources, set up water
production, and set up potable water storage bladders. Later on, additional
BEAR water system assets should arrive to enable installation of a complete
water plant, distribution, and wastewater collection system.

Production Package.




8.3. Water Operations Area (WOA) Site. Wherever the camp is located, there
should be enough real estate outside the camp placement area to allow for the
Water Operations Area. The WOA is an area identified for the Dual Water
Pump Station, Water Tank Farm, and Water Production subsystems. The WOA
should be sited on terrain that is relatively flat and free of debris. Table 8.3.
provides WOA dimensions and the quantity of water production subsystems
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                             119

required based upon camp population. Figure 8.5. shows a typical location for a

8.4. BEAR Water System. The BEAR water system consists of five distinct
subsystems shown in Table 8.4. It provides for both potable water and
wastewater distribution. The system is modular in design and scalable to meet a
variety of user deployment needs. Work crews have the flexibility to configure
subsystems to meet their unit’s specific needs. In addition to the information
addressed in this section, users should also refer to T.O. 40W4-21-1 and AFH
10-222, Volume 11 for more specific layout, configuration, and assembly
instructions.
Table 8.4. BEAR Water Subsystems.

                            WATER SUBYSTEMS
     1   The Source Run Subsystem (SRS).
         Water Production Subsystem (WPS) with Reverse Osmosis Water
     2
         Purification Units (ROWPU).
     3   550-Initial Subsystem.
     4   550-Follow-On Subsystem.
     5   Industrial Operations and Flightline Extension Subsystem.

8.4.1. Source Run Subsystem. The Source Run Subsystem (SRS) provides raw
water input (source water) for the contingency water system. It can pull water
from a raw water source (i.e., river, lake, sea, or ocean) up to 100 feet away and
20 feet below the pumping station. The SRS can pump source water up to a
distance of 6000 feet and to a height of 150 feet to a raw water storage tank.
8.4.2. Water Production Subsystem. The Water Production Subsystem (WPS)
generates potable water for distribution to user facilities within the contingency
water system. Water purification is accomplished using the 1500 ROWPU
and/or 600 ROWPU set up in a parallel configuration. The potable water
generated by the ROWPUs is distributed through another series of hoses and
fittings to 20,000-gallon potable water storage tanks. A typical water production
subsystem layout is illustrated in Figure 8.6.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                      121

Figure 8.6. Typical Water Production Subsystem Layout.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                          122

8.4.3. 550-Initial Water Distribution Subsystem. The 550-Initial Subsystem
(550-I) is the primary water distribution subsystem of the contingency water
system. The subsystem may be deployed as a stand-alone water distribution
subsystem; however, it is designed for expansion and buildup to meet varying
user deployment and operational needs. The 550-I subsystem normally receives
potable water input from the WPS. However, supplied adapters also provide a
means to draw water from other similar potable water sources. Potable water
input to the subsystem is typically distributed to three 20,000-gallon fabric
storage tanks. The water in theses tanks is distributed via a variable speed dual
pumping station. The two pumps are parallel configured, enabling dual or single
pump operation, and single pump isolation for maintenance or repair purposes.
Either pump is capable of maintaining water pressure within the loop
distribution line.
8.4.4. 550-Follow-On Water Distribution Subsystem. The 550-Follow-On
Subsystem (550-F) expands and builds off the 550-I subsystem; it is not
intended to function alone. When used as an expansion to the 550-I subsystem,
this system functions identically to the 550-I.
8.4.5. Industrial Operations and Flightline Extension Subsystem. The
Industrial Operations and Flightline Extension Subsystem is a potable water
expansion subsystem for the 550-Initial, 550-Follow-On, or Water Production
Subsystems. The extension subsystem can branch off any part of the 3-inch
pressurized feed line from these systems, and can supply potable water to
isolated user facilities such as latrines, showers, and kitchens. Additionally, hose
rollover protection ramps (hose bridges) safeguard hoses in the event potable
water distribution lines need to cross roadways or similar heavy vehicular traffic
areas.
8.4.6. BEAR Wastewater Distribution. Wastewater output from user facilities
is processed by various lift pumps and wastewater lines that distribute the
wastewater for disposal. In the layout shown in Figure 8.7., all wastewater is
distributed to a 25,000-gallon wastewater collection tank. The wastewater tank
has an aerator and pump to mix and aerate wastewater to maintain liquid state
for disposal. In this configuration, it is estimated that the wastewater tank will be
required to be pumped out one or more times per day. The waste can be sent to a
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                   123

lagoon, leach field, or treatment plant, etc. In another configuration (Figure
8.8.), only wastewater from latrines and kitchens is routed to the wastewater
tank. The remaining wastewater (graywater) from showers and laundries is sent
to graywater drying beds. In this configuration, it is estimated the wastewater
tank will be required to be pumped out once every five days.

8.5. Wastewater Disposal. Water usage generally results in wastewater that
requires disposal. The volume of wastewater alone can cause significant
problems in the field, and depending on the source, wastewater may also contain
suspended solids and particulate matter, organic material, dissolved salts,
biological and pathogenic organisms, and even toxic chemicals. In any case,
proper wastewater disposal is essential to protect the health of the force.
Deployed units must comply with theater-specific procedures and guidance for
wastewater disposal. The following options should be considered:
8.5.1. Connection to an established installation sanitary sewer system.
8.5.2. Collection and retention of wastewater for engineer/contractor removal to
a fixed treatment facility.
8.5.3. Engineer construction of semi-permanent wastewater collection and
disposal systems.
8.5.4. Use of a field expedient wastewater disposal system, if available.
8.6. Expedient Wastewater Disposal Methods. There are several expedient
wastewater disposal methods. Some include evaporation beds, seepage pits,
soakage pits and soakage trenches, sewage lagoons and leach fields. Although
each of these will be briefly discussed here, refer to UFC 3-240-02N,
Wastewater Treatment Systems Augmenting Handbook, FM 3-34.471,
Plumbing, Pipe Fitting, and Sewerage, theater-specific requirements, or other
more definitive guidance for detailed procedures and construction information.
In addition, Attachment 7 provides the pros and cons of some of these
expedient wastewater disposal methods, including special considerations for
disposal facilities in desert environments.
8.6.1. Evaporation Beds. Evaporation beds (aka drying beds) are often used to
dispose of graywater from shower and laundry facilities in hot, dry climates and
where clay soil prevents the use of standard soakage pits. Generally, expedient
evaporation beds measure 8 by 10 feet (Figure 8.9.), although larger
evaporation fields can be constructed to handle greater amounts of graywater as
shown in Figure 8.10.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        126

Figure 8.9. Typical Evaporation Bed Construction.




Figure 8.10. Evaporation Field.




8.6.2. Seepage Pits. Seepage pits can also efficiently dispose of wastewater. The
required size of a seepage pit can be determined from a percolation test and the
estimated amount of effluent from the facility. Several smaller pits for a facility
may be more feasible than one large pit. When more than one pit is used, ensure
that there is equal distribution of the wastewater to all the pits. The pits should
be located outside the base camp and at least 100 feet from the nearest water
source.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        127

8.6.3. Kitchen Soakage Pits and Trenches. Prior to installation of the BEAR
water system, wastewater from kitchens can be disposed of using a kitchen
soakage pit or trench (Figure 8.11.). Soakage trenches are used when the
groundwater level or a rock formation precludes digging a soakage pit.
Figure 8.11. Soakage Trench with Barrel-Filter Grease Trap.




8.6.4. Barrel-Filter Grease Trap. There are many types and variations of
expedient grease traps. The barrel-filter grease trap is typically used with kitchen
soakage pits and trenches (Figure 8.12.). The trap is usually placed directly over
the soakage pit or on a platform with a trough leading to the pit. However, it can
be embedded within a soakage pit as illustrated in Figure 8.13.
Figure 8.12. Barrel-Filter Grease Trap Design.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                     128

Figure 8.13. Imbedded Grease Trap.




8.6.5. Sewage Lagoons. Sewage lagoons (Figure 8.14.) are common throughout
the world. Although easy to construct, sewage lagoons are not a recommended
theater practice. Sewage lagoons must be located at least one-half mile from the
population center because of the odors produced by anaerobic digestion. The
increased length of the sewer collection system, compounded by the possible
need for automatic lift stations, significantly increases the material cost and
construction effort required for a complete system.
Figure 8.14. Sewage Lagoon.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         129

8.6.6. Leach Fields. Leach fields (also termed “absorption fields”) are more
complicated than wastewater disposal methods previously addressed and they
are used in conjunction with septic tank treatment as the final treatment and
disposal process for the septic system. Leach fields (Figure 8.15.) normally
consist of perforated distribution pipe laid in trenches or beds that are filled with
rock. The septic tank effluent is distributed by the perforated pipe and allowed to
percolate through the ground, where it is filtered and treated by naturally
occurring bacteria and oxygen. Once effluent is released from the septic tank, it
travels by gravity through a solid PVC pipe to the distribution box. The
distribution box is a reinforced concrete structure that distributes the septic tank
effluent evenly throughout the absorption field through several 4-inch diameter
perforated pipes.
Figure 8.15. Leach Field and Septic Tank Configuration.

      ELECTRICAL POWER GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION

9.1. General Information. Developing a bare base electrical power generation
and distribution system is a two-phase approach. The first phase is to provide
initial power via mobile electric power (MEP) generators to those functions
critical to initial base operation. The second and much more complex phase is to
establish primary power plants and install the overall base electrical distribution
network. It is advantageous to have multi-skilled, and forklift qualified,
electrical systems and electrical power production personnel to enable the
expeditious, independent, and concurrent completion of these phases. Ensure
personnel wear appropriate PPE (including arc flash protection), as required in
UFC 3-560-01. In addition, noise hazard and high voltage warning signs should
be installed where appropriate.

                                WARNING
            Working on energized electrical equipment is prohibited
            except in rare circumstances, and then only when
            justified and approved by the BCE or equivalent in
            accordance with AFI 32-1064, Electrical Safe Practices.

9.2. Mobile Electric Power (MEP) Generators. During the initial base
planning and layout stages, precisely identify the locations of mission-critical
facilities that require immediate mobile generator support. In most instances,
these facilities will also require fulltime emergency or backup power generators;
AFI 32-1063, Electrical Power Systems, identifies emergency and standby
power authorizations. Typical authorized facilities include command and control
facilities, air traffic control towers, feeding facility, water plant, communication
facilities, and other mission-essential facilities. The bare base Wing Commander
has final authority to determine which facilities receive dedicated generator
support. Once these facilities are identified and located, electrical power
production personnel determine the appropriate size generator for each facility.
Almost without fail, there will be more facilities requiring dedicated generator
support than there are generators. One way to overcome this problem is to feed
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                    131

multiple facilities from a centrally located secondary distribution center (SDC)
that is power by a single generator. Attempt to place SDCs in positions where
they can eventually be integrated into the primary distribution network without
having to relocate them. As facilities are erected, electrical personnel connect
the secondary service to the facility distribution panels when appropriate. Once
mobile generators are online, specifically designate personnel to accomplish
regularly scheduled operational checks, recurring maintenance, and establish a
refueling plan with base fuels personnel. Anticipate that mobile generators will
provide prime power between 10 and 15 days—it may take that long before the
base electrical distribution grid is installed and energized.
9.3. Prime Power Plants. Concurrent with installing MEP generators, a team
should setup main power plants (Figure 9.1.). This effort includes placing prime
generators (including Interim Power Units or IPUs), installing and connecting
fuel bladders, setting up control panels for remote operation, installing and
connecting primary switching centers and installing grounding systems. For
information in addition to that addressed here, refer to T.O. 35C2-3-474-1,
Generator Set, Diesel Engine-Driven, Wheel-Mounted 750-KW, 3-Phase, 4-
Wire, 2200/3800 and 2400/4160 Volts, when installation and siting MEP-012A
generators.
Figure 9.1. MEP-12 Power Plant.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                      132

9.3.1. Centrally located high-voltage generators offer the most advantageous
primary distribution system, however, in a high threat area, disperse these
generators between prime and slave power plant locations to improve
survivability. Multiple power plants and primary distribution loops that
interconnect these plants are especially critical in high-threat locations. If a
power plant becomes inoperative for any reason, the electrical grid can be
energized from the remaining power plant(s).
9.3.2. Diesel generators, which generate hazardous noise levels, should be
placed a sufficient distance from work or lodging facilities to prevent personnel
injury. If separation distances are an issue, noise barriers or baffles should be
installed. Concrete "Bitburg" revetments and earthen berms have proven to be
effective in this regard. However, ensure adequate airflow and safety clearances
are maintained around the equipment.
9.4. Electrical Power Distribution. The SDC (Figure 9.2.) is an integral part of
BEAR electrical distribution. It is designed to received regulated electrical
power at 2400/4160 VAC, and transform the power into 120/208 VAC.
Following the site layout plan, electrical personnel place SDCs at their required
locations and begin connecting the SDCs to primary switching centers (Figure
9.3.) or legacy primary distribution centers (Figure 9.4.) at the power plants.
Figure 9.2. Secondary Distribution Center (SDC).
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                   133

Figure 9.3. Primary Switching Center (PSC).




Figure 9.4. Primary Distribution Center (PDC).




9.4.1. As facilities are erected, crews make secondary distribution connections
between the SDCs and facility power distribution panels (Figure 9.5.) and the
internal connections of equipment within facilities.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                     134

Figure 9.5. Power Distribution Panel (PDP).




9.4.2. For planning and installation purposes use the following “rules of thumb”
regarding SDCs:
9.4.2.1. Limit the load on each SDC circuit to 21.6 kVA.
9.4.2.2. Limit the total load on each SDC to 150 kVA.
9.4.2.3. Limit the number of shelters on a SDC to ten when the Field-
Deployable Environmental Control Unit (FDECU) is used in each shelter.
9.4.2.4. One MEP-12, 750 kW generator (operating at 80% of its maximum
capacity) will support no more than 5 SDCs per one 200-amp PSC/PDC output
circuit when facilities are operating at maximum loads with FDECUs.
9.4.2.5. Under normal operating loads, a power plant with at least two
generators operating will support 6 to 10 SDCs per PSC/PDC circuit when
facilities have FDECUs (Figure 9.6.), and 10 to 15 SDCs per circuit when
facilities do not have FDECUs.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                     135

Figure 9.6. Typical SDC/Facility Configuration with FDECUs.




9.4.3. Several remote area lighting sets (RALS) are included in BEAR unit type
codes (UTCs) and most should arrive relatively early in the overall asset flow.
Powered by SDCs, RALS (Figure 9.7.) support area lighting requirements for
such functions as aerial port offloading, aircraft maintenance, POL transfer and
security of critical assets. Be prepared to provide electrical support to RALS as
soon as these systems come on line. Refer to T.O. 35F5-5-22-1, Remote Area
Lighting System (RALS) to site, install, and operate RALS.
Figure 9.7. Remote Area Lighting Systems Connect to SDC.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        136

9.4.4. Facilities and SDCs should be sited to optimize both the number of
facilities each SDC serves (more is generally better, up to a maximum of 10
with FDECUs or up to 16 without air conditioners as long as the total load does
not exceed 150 kVA) and the length of secondary cable runs (shorter is
generally better, ideally no more than 150 feet). Refer to T.O. 35CA2-2-17-1,
Operation and Maintenance Manual, Secondary Distribution Center (SDC) 150
KVA (DPGDS), for additional SDC installation and siting instructions.
9.4.5. When initially laying prime power (high voltage) electrical cable, if soil
conditions or time and equipment constraints prevent its immediate burial, the
BCE may make an operational risk management decision to leave some or all of
the high-voltage cable on the surface initially. If that is the case, take measures
to mitigate the risk of personnel injury or damage to the cables. As a minimum,
bury or otherwise protect cables crossing roads and high-traffic walkways. Bring
the base onto the electrical grid in stages as the population increases and
functional area activities dictate. Whenever the primary electrical grid can pick
up facilities served by MEP generators, reconfigure these units as standby or
emergency backup power. Obviously, as the primary power plants energized,
devote a portion of electrical power production crews to plant operations and
maintenance. Once the electrical generation and distribution system is fully
installed and operational, bury all aboveground primary power electrical cables
(Figure 9.8.). See AFH 10-222, Volume 5 for more detailed information on
power plant installation.

                         SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL

10.1. General Information. Proper disposition of solid waste during and after
bare base development can be an overwhelming task. The goal is to dispose of
solid waste in an environmentally acceptable manner consistent with good
sanitary engineering principles and still accomplish the unit mission. There are
many information sources pertaining to solid waste disposal in a deployed
environment, and a few general principles are addressed in this chapter. AFI 32-
7001, Environmental Management, AFI 32-7042, Waste Management, UFC 3-
240-10A, Sanitary Landfill, and AFH 10-222, Volume 4, all provide good solid
waste management principles, however, engineers should follow local and
theater-specific waste management guidance and procedures.
10.2. Basic Guidelines. Disposal of solid waste is dependent on the location and
surrounding environment. Some bases use host-nation contractors to dispose of
solid waste, some use on-site facilities, and others use a combination of these
methods. Whatever method is used, installations should try to minimize the
amount of solid waste that must be disposed of while still satisfying command
requirements. Solid waste managers typically use the hierarchy in Table 10.1.
when making waste diversion and disposal decisions. However, additional
considerations may be necessary for overseas contingency operations.
Table 10.1. Waste Diversion and Disposal Hierarchy.

10.2.1. Disposal methods should be thoroughly planned out and sited (collocated
if necessary) for easy use. Waste collection areas should be downwind of base
populated areas to prevent nuisance odors.
10.2.2. Improper disposal of waste may contribute to environmental
contamination, and accumulated waste could serve as a breeding ground for
rodents and arthropods. If on-base locations are created for garbage and refuse
disposal, ensure a stringent pest control program is instituted to alleviate the
danger or spread of disease. See Chapter 7 for information on pest management
procedures and guidance.
10.2.3. Weigh all issues and alternatives before selecting the installation’s
disposal methods.
10.3. Waste Reduction and Disposal Methods.
10.3.1. Recycling. Recycling is an effective means to reduce solid waste
disposal streams. Solid waste like high-grade paper, plastic, cardboard, scrap
metals, glass, wood cartons, pallets, used oil, tires, batteries, and more can be
disposed of without burying or burning. Keep in mind equipment may need to
be purchased or contracted to grind, compress, and bundle the recyclables for
movement. Materials separated for recycling should be stored so they do not
constitute a fire, health or safety hazard or provide food or harborage for
vectors. They should also be contained or bundled to avoid spillage.
10.3.2. Solid Waste Contractors. Using host-nation contractors can sometimes
be the most practical approach to disposing of solid waste. Many expeditionary
air bases are located at existing airports near towns and cities with large
municipal solid waste disposal operations. While there are clear advantages to
using a well-established and proficient local contractor for waste disposal, use of
host-nation workers could create security issues. Some installations may address
these security issues by using military escorts (Figure 10.1.) and establish waste
collection points outside of key areas; others may establish a solid waste transfer
station near a base entry point where waste is picked up by the contractor,
thereby denying their access to other areas of the base. The latter method, while
more secure, requires significant resources and personnel for on-base waste
collection before moving the solid waste to a transfer station.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                      139

Figure 10.1. Escorts Monitor Host-Nation Contractors.




10.3.3. Composting. Another method of reducing solid waste, composting is an
engineered process that promotes the biochemical decaying of organic material.
During bare base beddown, a large percentage of the solid waste is packaging
materials (such as cardboard, paper, and plastic), waste food, and sewage sludge.
Although plenty of this material is biodegradable, it still presents a significant
waste management challenge, especially in countries with few modern waste
facilities. When composting, solid waste is usually shredded with most of the
nonorganic material removed. The remaining organic material is then arranged
into a row and turned frequently to promote decomposition. In addition to
disposing of unwanted solid waste, compost can be useful for agricultural
purposes and as a cover material on slopes or at sanitary landfills because of its
resistance to erosion. If a compost operation is near the airfield, it should be
monitored to ensure it does not adversely affect air operations. Installations
anticipating establishing a composting operation should comply with DOD Final
Governing Standards composting regulations or other applicable theater
requirements.
10.3.4. Landfills. Disposing of solid waste in a landfill is a common practice at
expeditionary bare bases (Figure 10.2.). However, before establishing a new or
expanding an existing landfill, units must have the approval of the CCDR.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         140

Landfills at expeditionary bare bases generally fall into two categories,
municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLF) or sanitary landfills.
Figure 10.2. Solid Waste Landfills.




10.3.4.1. A MSWLF is a discrete area of land or an excavation, on or off an
installation, that receives solid waste like durable goods (e.g., appliances, tires,
batteries), non-durable goods (e.g., newspapers, books, magazines), containers
and packaging, food wastes, yard trimmings, and miscellaneous organic wastes
from residential, commercial, and industrial non-process sources. During landfill
operations, work crews should use standard sanitary landfill techniques of
spreading and compacting solid wastes and placing daily cover over disposed
solid waste at the end of each operating day.
10.3.4.2. Sanitary landfilling is an engineered solid waste disposal process that
minimizes environmental hazards and nuisances of land disposal. Solid waste is
delivered to a carefully selected and prepared site, deposited into a trench or
controlled area, compacted, and covered with soil or other material daily. The
sanitary landfill is capable of accepting a wide variety of solid waste types.
Nearly all rubbish, garbage, trash, ashes, solid organic waste, and miscellaneous
solids may be disposed of safely. This method can also be used in combination
with other waste reduction methods for example, incineration, baling,
compacting, or shredding.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                     141

10.3.5. Incinerator Facilities. In the context of this chapter, an incinerator is
defined as any furnace used in the process of burning solid or liquid waste for
the purpose of reducing the volume of the waste by removing combustible
matter (Figure 10.3.). Incinerators must meet published air emissions/air quality
requirements. Incinerator operations at expeditionary bases are used generally as
a waste reduction method and not a disposal method. However, incineration can
be used for energy recovery at more technically sophisticated facilities.
Regardless, ash by-product from the incineration process must be disposed of
through normal waste disposal methods. Therefore, the incineration facility
should be located as close to the waste collection point as possible to simplify
the collection process. Although many factors affect the location of an
incinerator plant, below are two basic factors:
10.3.5.1. Traffic. Consider the frequency and size of vehicles utilizing the
incinerator facility. Access roads should be all-season permanent roads;
however, travel on and across primary roads shall be minimized.
10.3.5.2. Location. Select locations that help mitigate noise and odors from the
incinerator. Prevailing wind direction should be evaluated to avoid odors being
transmitted to residential sites.
Figure 10.3. Incinerator Facility at Forward Operating Location.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                     142

10.3.6. Burn Pits. Open-air burn pits are prohibited during contingency
operations except when no alternative disposal method is feasible. Open-air burn
pits are a short-term solution to reduce the volume of solid waste during
contingency operations. Long-term solutions include the use of incinerators and
landfills. When used, open-air burn pits will be operated in a manner that
prevents or minimizes risks to humans and the environment. Manage open-air
burn pits in contingency operations IAW DODI 4715-19, Use of Open-air Burn
Pits in Contingency Operations.
10.4. Hazardous Waste. Disposal of hazardous waste at expeditionary
contingency bases must comply with DOD and HN regulations. Hazardous
waste (HW) includes waste that is ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic
(especially POL and some chemicals), and requires special handling,
transportation, disposal, and documentation. If HW is disposed of using an
incinerator, the incinerator must be licensed or permitted by a component HN
authority or approved by the DOD Environmental Executive Agent (EEA).
Consult with base hazardous materials personnel for guidance and assistance on
the handling and disposing of hazardous waste.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                       143

                                   Chapter 11

                               BASE DEFENSE

11.1. General Information. Protection of personnel and assets is always an
important task at expeditionary bases. It can be especially challenging when
forces are beddown at austere, forward locations that are close to the battle area
or areas with a high probability of terrorist attacks. Although absolute protection
against all attacks is not possible, protective plans and procedures should be
implemented based on the latest threat information. During bare base
development, engineer and security forces (SF) coordinate base defense
requirements, establish protection zones, reinforce fighting positions, clear or
establish obstacles, and harden base perimeters; all in an effort to protect vital
resources (Figure 11.1.). Depending on potential threats, engineer work crews
can also be heavily engaged in bunker construction and facility hardening
activities. Even at low threat locations, workers could be tasked to build FP
facilities and structures, because low-threat can easily turn into high threat
overnight.
Figure 11.1. CE and SF Coordinate Building of Guard Tower.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                          144

11.1.1. Establishing and maintaining certain FP measures are an important bare
base development responsibility. For additional guidance on FP measures and
protective construction requirements, refer to UFC 4-010-01, the JFOB
Survivability and Protective Construction Handbook, AFH 10-222, Volumes 3
and 14, and the theater engineer staff. In addition, detail drawings and
construction details for many protective structures can be downloaded from the
Theater Construction Management System (TCMS) website at
http://www.tcms.net.
11.1.2. Overall, base defense measures are designed to protect personnel,
facilities, and critical assets. While the actual site work is often the most visible
part of FP measures, engineer involvement in the planning process, including
site survey and site layout, is equally important.
11.1.2.1. Site Survey. During the site survey, learn as much as possible about the
region and specific location to assist in selecting a site suitable to beddown the
expected population, weapon systems, support equipment, and other assets.
11.1.2.2. Site Layout. Ensure FP is addressed and integrated into site layout. If
the site layout is not well thought out, it could be extremely difficult and costly
to rearrange assets to provide increased protection once beddown is complete.
11.1.3. As expeditionary airbases experience planned and unplanned growth,
they typically end up needing additional land and resources. Consequently,
every change that increases the base’s footprint usually requires modification to
local FP measures. Always consider FP requirements when planning future
expansion and growth.
11.1.4. Many expeditionary and temporary structures used during contingencies
are composed of metal frames and fabric or wood frames and rigid walls, they
are generally impractical to harden or retrofit. For this reason, standoff distance
is the primary approach to FP in the expeditionary environment, which often
drives the need for larger sites. Space should be sufficient to allow for dispersal
of certain functions and equipment and to provide the commander the flexibility
to increase the beddown population and standoff distances if needed in response
to higher threat levels.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        145

11.1.5. Although BEAR shelters provide beddown forces with vital temporary
protection from the elements at locations with limited infrastructure and support
facilities, these same shelters create additional FP challenges for the reasons
addressed above. The inherent advantages of lighter, leaner, and more mobile
shelters means some tradeoffs in survivability were allowed. Most BEAR
facilities cannot withstand even small arms fire, let alone fused munitions
detonation (Figure 11.2.). This makes it imperative that personnel and asset
protection be seriously considered at bare base locations, especially in high
threat areas. In fact, in serious high threat areas, one of the first tasks might be
digging foxholes and protective trenches for personnel protection.
Figure 11.2. Erecting Non-Hardened BEAR Shelter.




11.1.6. BEAR packages also include assets for aircraft protection, such as bin
revetment kits addressed in Chapter 4. However, because of their weight, do
not expect to receive these kits until well into the deployment timeline. In fact,
they may even arrive by ship rather than air. Nevertheless, have all parking
plans, revetment locations and configurations and fill material sources identified
early. Start installing the kits as soon as they arrive.
11.2. Physical Security Measures. A key element of FP is physical security.
The two broad areas of physical security that civil engineers might dedicate the
majority of time and resources in expeditionary environments include perimeter
security and internal security.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                      146

11.2.1. Perimeter Security. One of the most important FP tasks civil engineers
undertake during the initial stages of deployment and beddown is establishing
perimeter security. Working with SF, civil engineers help establish a continuous
physical barrier that clearly defines the physical limits of the site to prevent
unauthorized access. Perimeter security may include the following:
11.2.1.1. Perimeter berms and ditches (See Chapter 4).
11.2.1.2. Perimeter fencing.
11.2.1.3. Obstacles.
11.2.1.4. Terrain modification and vegetation-clear zones.
11.2.1.5. Obscuration screens.
11.2.1.6. Entry control points and search pits.
11.2.1.7. Security lighting.
11.2.1.8. Guard towers/observation posts.
11.2.1.9. Defensive fighting positions.
11.2.2. Internal Security. The focus on internal security, from a civil engineer
perspective, generally involves establishing protective measures inside the base,
and may include the following:
11.2.2.1. Side-wall protection and facility hardening.
11.2.2.2. Dispersal.
11.2.2.3. Compartmentalization.
11.2.2.4. Revetments.
11.2.2.5. Personnel bunkers.
11.2.2.6. Power and water protection.
11.2.3. Protective Shelters or Bunkers. When the installation of BEAR assets
nears completion, attention should be turned to providing protective shelters or
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                       147

bunkers for the base populace. These protective structures are intended for short-
term use and are generally employed to shelter personnel from the effects of
weapon attacks. They may be constructed using prefabricated concrete modular
forms, improvised materials, or built by local contractors.
11.2.3.1. Protective shelters may be the only alternative when there are not
enough permanently hardened facilities in the right locations—make sure they
are sited in areas readily accessible to base personnel. This is especially true in
bare base or dispersed operations.
11.2.3.2. The best protective shelter is usually one that provides the most
protection but requires the least amount of effort to construct. Shelters should
have as much overhead cover as possible. Belowground shelters require the
most construction effort but generally provide the highest level of protection
from conventional and chemical weapons. Aboveground shelters provide the
best observation and are easier to enter and exit than belowground shelters. They
provide the least amount of protection from conventional weapons; however,
they do provide protection against liquid droplets of chemical agents.
Aboveground shelters are used when water levels are close to the ground surface
or when the ground is so hard that digging a belowground shelter is impractical.
Illustrated in Figure 11.3. is one example of a protective shelter currently being
used in Southwest Asia.
Figure 11.3. Improvised Bunker Using Concrete Culverts and Sandbags.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                        148

11.2.3.3. If necessary, other types of improvised shelters can be constructed
using general construction materials. As the base is being established, look for
and store such items as 55-gallon drums, pieces of revetment material, structural
steel shapes, timber and wood packing materials, ship dunnage, steel or precast
concrete culvert sections, CONEX boxes, etc. Unserviceable aluminum matting
may be readily available, but must be used with caution since they were not
designed to support heavy loads over a large clear span. Do not use BEAR
shipping and storage containers for shelter components; they will be needed
intact later on for reconstitution of assets. Figure 11.4. illustrate an improvised
shelter made from general construction materials, sandbags, containers, and
other available materials.
Figure 11.4. Metal Culvert Shelter.




11.2.4. Defensive Fighting Positions. Defensive fighting positions are sited in
locations that support base defense operations. They are generally positioned
around the base perimeter and other areas as needed. They are also used for
work party security and in conjunction with dispersed operations. These fighting
positions can range from expediently constructed bunkers to elevated hardened
observation towers.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                       149

11.2.5. Obstacles and Barriers. During bare base development, obstacles and
barriers should also be erected/place where needed to support FP requirements.
While there are many different types and functions, expedient anti-personnel
and anti-vehicle structures will likely be needed at various locations around the
base perimeter and at key on-base facilities. One example of a barrier is shown
in Figure 11.5.
Figure 11.5. Constructing Security Barrier around Flightline.




11.2.6. Berms and Revetments. It may be necessary to build berms and
revetments around critical facilities and utility nodes. Although it will be nearly
impossible to construct protective features for all candidate locations quickly
due to material, time or manpower shortfalls, prioritize your requirements
carefully. Look primarily at mission sensitivity. Consider protecting water and
power plants early—without these utility services bare base operations will
rapidly shut down. Also, consider key secondary distribution centers,
maintenance shops, and command posts. See Chapter 4 for more information
on siting berms and revetments.
11.2.7. Clearing Obstacles. In addition to erecting obstacles for FP, removing
unwanted obstacles is also an important FP task for engineers. Work crews may
need to clear obstacles on or around the airfield or clear terrain along the base
perimeter. Especially, in areas where SF need clear areas or vegetation-free
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                     150

zones for observation or to eliminate possible areas of enemy concealment near
the installation’s boundary.
11.3. CBRN Defense. The potential for accidental or deliberate release of
CBRN agents within the operational area is a major concern. Additionally, the
threat of CBRN materials being used against a bare base, either during or after
construction, is always present. Engineers are responsible for a number of FP
tasks associated with CBRN defense; some of them are listed below.
11.3.1. Coordinate CBRN defense operations.
11.3.2. Layout CBRN defense areas.
11.3.3. Establish CBRN monitoring points.
11.3.4. Establish alerting system and contamination control areas.
11.3.5. Construct and improve personnel shelters.
11.3.6. Determine decontamination procedures.
11.3.7. Site Decontamination Stations.
11.3.8. While emergency management (EM) specialists primarily support all of
the CBRN defense tasks listed above, other engineer specialists will also be
involved. For example, utilities personnel may need to run water lines to
decontamination stations; engineering assistants may be needed to survey
potential sites for decontamination stations, contamination control areas and
shelters; HVAC personnel could be involved with installing and maintaining
collective protection (COLPRO) systems; and heavy equipment operators might
have to level terrain or dig drainage ditches for decontamination operations.
Nearly every Prime BEEF specialty will somehow be involved in CBRN
defense and FP operations.

Terms
Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA)—A field operating
agency (FOA) located at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. The Directorate of
Readiness Support (HQ AFCESA/CEX) acts as the Air Force program manager
for Base Civil Engineer (BCE) Contingency Response Planning.
Bare Base—An installation having minimum essential facilities to house,
sustain, and support operations to include, if required, a stabilized runway,
taxiways, and aircraft parking areas. A bare base must have a source of water
that can be made potable. Other requirements to operate under bare base
conditions form a necessary part of the force package deployed to the bare base.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                         164

Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR)—Facilities, equipment, and
basic infrastructure to support the beddown of deployed forces and aircraft at
austere locations; a critical capability to fielding expeditionary aerospace forces.
Also known as BEAR, the resources include tents, field kitchens, latrine
systems, shop equipment, electrical and power systems, runway systems, aircraft
shelters, and water distribution systems needed to sustain operations.
Beddown—A location at which a deploying unit operates during a contingency.
It is usually, but not always, in the area of responsibility.
Bitumen or Bituminous—The most common type of asphalt surface placed in
the theater of operations.
C-day—The unnamed day on which a deployment operation commences or is
to commence.
Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense—The
methods, plans, procedures and training required to establish defense measures
against the effects of attack by nuclear weapons or chemical and biological
agents.
Collective Protection (COLPRO)—systems protect those inside a building,
room, shelter or tent against contamination through the combination of
impermeable structural materials, air filtration equipment, air locks, and over
pressurization.
Collective Protection Shelter—A filtered air shelter that provides a
contamination-free working environment for selected portions of the force such
as command and control elements. The shelter allows relief from continuous
wear of chemical protective equipment.
Disease Vector—Any animal capable of transmitting the causative agent of a
human disease; serving as an intermediate or reservoir host of a pathogenic
organism; or producing human discomfort or injury, including (but not limited
to) mosquitoes, flies, ticks, mites, snails, and rodents.
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                       165

Expeditionary Structures—Those structures intended to be inhabited for no
more than 1 year after they are erected. This group of structures typically
includes tents, Small and Medium Shelter Systems, Expandable Shelter
Containers (ESC), ISO and CONEX containers, and General Purpose (GP)
Medium tents and GP Large tents, etc.
Integrated Pest Management—A sustainable approach to managing pests by
combining biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools in a way that
minimizes economic, health, and environmental risks.
Minimum Aircraft Operating Surface—The minimum surface on an airfield
which is essential for the movement of aircraft. It includes the aircraft dispersal
areas, the minimum operating strip, and the taxiways between them.
Minimum Operating Strip—A runway which meets the minimum
requirements for operating assigned and/or allocated aircraft types on a
particular airfield at maximum or combat gross weight.
National Pipe Thread—A U.S. standard for tapered threads used to join pipes
and fittings.
Pests—Arthropods, birds, rodents, nematodes, fungi, bacteria, viruses, algae,
snails, marine borers, snakes, weeds, and other organisms (except for human or
animal disease-causing organisms) that adversely affect readiness, military
operations, or the well-being of personnel and animals; attack or damage real
property, supplies, equipment, or vegetation; or are otherwise undesirable.
Pest Management—The prevention and control of disease vectors and pests
that may adversely affect the DOD mission or military operations; the health and
well-being of people; or structures, materiel, or property.
Pest Management Professional. DOD military officers commissioned in the
Medical Service or Biomedical Sciences Corps or DOD civilian personnel with
college degrees in biological, physical or agricultural sciences whose current job
includes pest management responsibilities. DOD civilian employees shall also
meet Office of Personnel Management (OPM) qualification standards. Based on
assignment, some professional pest management personnel are pest management
consultants. (DODI 4150.07)
AFH10-222 Volume 1, 23 January 2012                                       166

Pesticide—Any substance or mixture of substances, including biological control
agents, that may prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate pests and is specifically
labeled for use by the EPA. Also, any substance or mixture of substances used
as a plant regulator, defoliant, desiccant, disinfectant, or biocide. The AFPMB
does not review or approve disinfectants or biocides.
Solid Waste—Garbage, refuse, sludge, and other discarded materials, including
solid, semi-solid, liquid, and contained gaseous materials resulting from
industrial and commercial operations and from community activities. It does not
include solids or dissolved material in domestic sewage or other significant
pollutants in water resources, such as silt, dissolved or suspended solids in
industrial wastewater effluent, dissolved materials in irrigation return flows, or
other common water pollutants.
Temporary Structures—Those structures that are erected with an expected
occupancy of 3 years or less. This group of structures typically includes wood
frame and rigid wall construction, and such things as Southeast Asia (SEA)
Huts, hardback tents, ISO and CONEX containers, pre-engineered buildings,
trailers, stress tensioned shelters, Expandable Shelter Containers (ESC), and
Aircraft Hangars (ACH).
Theater of Operations—An operational area defined by the geographic
combatant commander for the conduct or support of specific military operations.
Multiple theaters of operations normally will be geographically separate and
focused on different missions. Theaters of operations are usually of significant
size, allowing for operations in depth and over extended periods of time. Also
called TO.

A6.2. Straddle Trench Latrines.

                 DESCRIPTION: Straddle Trench Latrines
 • Uncovered trenches without a seat above.
 • Boards may be placed on the ground along both sides of trench to
   provide better footing and prevent crumbling/cave in of sides.
 • Two trenches. Each trench is 1 foot wide x 2.5 feet deep x 4 feet long
   and can accommodate 2 people at a time.
 • Excreta must be covered with soil after each use since the trenches are
   open to filth flies, thereby reducing the serviceable volume.
 • Design capacity: 2 trenches (capacity for 4) per 100 males, 3 trenches
   (capacity for 6) per 100 females.
 • An interim measure, only expected to last 1-3 days while final facilities
   are being constructed are installed.

 • Designed for liquids only.
 • Pit 4 feet x 4 feet filled with gravel, rubble, or shredded metal, e.g.,
   aluminum cans.
 • Constructed as stand-alone urine soakage pits with urine tubes or pipes.
 • Should be constructed in conjunction with standard in-ground latrines,
   chemical toilets or burn-out latrines for solid human waste.
 • Soakage pits or trenches for shower and kitchen are built separately from
   urine soakage pits. Four trenches radiating from a central1-foot deep pit
   are 6 feet long, 2 feet wide and increase in depth from 1 to 1-1/2 feet.
   Kitchen soakage pits or trenches also need grease traps to prevent
   percolation from being blocked.
 • No estimate of length of service for soakage pits and trenches is made in
   any field manuals, except the instruction to build a new one when the
   existing one stops working (standing water observed).
