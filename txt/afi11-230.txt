Section 1B—General TERPS Definitions, Procedures, and Requirements

1.7. Holding Patterns. Apply holding pattern requirements established in FAA Order 7130.3,
Holding Pattern Criteria, FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1, Chapter 2, Section 9, AATCP-1,
PANS-OPS and as follows. Holding at (overhead) a Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) facility
is nonstandard regardless of the criteria being applied.
   1.7.1. Develop all holding patterns to accommodate a holding airspeed of 310 knots
   indicated airspeed (KIAS). When an operational requirement exists, develop the holding
   pattern using the required airspeed (less than 310 KIAS) and publish this airspeed as the
   maximum airspeed on the planview of the procedure, adjacent to the holding pattern. Do not
   publish the standard holding airspeed of 310 KIAS or standard (timed) holding leg lengths on
   the planview. Note: For ICAO holding airspeeds, see Doc 8168 Vol II.
   1.7.2. Select the maximum holding altitude based on the highest anticipated altitude that will
   be used by ATC.
   1.7.3. At locations where the AF has instrument procedure development responsibility,
   advise military and FAA ATC facility management, including adjacent facilities with
   Approach Control responsibility, of all limitations (maximum speed and altitude) and any
   overlap of the holding pattern primary obstacle clearance area into the adjacent facility’s
   airspace associated with each holding pattern.
   1.7.4. Evaluate holding patterns based on the distance measuring equipment (DME) slant
   range effect regardless of the altitude specified or the difference between slant range and
   geographical distance. DME holding fixes may be established in tenths of a NM only when
   applying US TERPS criteria; PANS-OPS (ICAO/NATO) requires DME holding fixes to be
   established in whole NM values.
   1.7.5. RNAV holding pattern criteria. Holding pattern development at an RNAV PFAF/FAF
   waypoint is not authorized. Use FAA Order 7130.3, Chapter 2, Conventional Holding
   Criteria, to develop RNAV holding with the following exceptions:
      1.7.5.1. Paragraph 2 3, Navigational Aid (NAVAID) Ground and Airborne System
      Tolerance. Use basic holding pattern assumptions for GPS holding pattern development
      except use a constant fix error of 0.5 NM.
      1.7.5.2. Paragraph 2-12, Fix Distances. When determining the appropriate RNAV
      holding pattern template, do not apply Table 7 from Chapter 6; use the 15-29.9 NM Fix-
      to-NAVAID Distance column of Table 2 Holding Pattern Selection Chart from Chapter
      2.
      1.7.5.3. Paragraph 2-19, DME Leg Lengths. Use Chapter 6, GPS Holding Patterns,
      paragraph 6-4, GPS Leg Length Determination, and Table 8 to determine maximum
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                    13


       RNAV holding leg lengths. Determine RNAV holding leg lengths using along track
       distance (ATD) fixes only. Timing is not authorized for RNAV holding. Notes: There
       is no requirement for RNAV holding patterns to be associated with or aligned with any
       DME source. There is no TERPS criterion defining a “standard” RNAV holding leg
       length. All RNAV holding leg lengths shall be charted by NGA at each applicable
       holding pattern on the RNAV instrument procedure.
       1.7.5.4. Do not apply the following to RNAV holding pattern development: paragraphs
       2.14; 2.15; 2.16; 2.17; 2.18; 2.20; 2.21; 2.22; Section 5, and paragraphs 2.31; 2.34; and
       2.35. Do not apply fix end or outbound end reduction areas to RNAV holding patterns.
   1.7.6. Each holding pattern shall be documented on FAA Form 8260-2 IAW guidance in
   FAA Order 8260.19, Flight Procedures and Airspace.
   1.7.7. Missed Approach Holding. When a holding pattern has been evaluated for a climb-in-
   hold and missed approach climb-in-holding is required, publish the information in the missed
   approach instructions IAW FAA Order 8260.19, paragraphs 8-56.f.(1) or 8-56.f.(2), as
   applicable.
   1.7.8. Turbulent Air Holding. Turbulent air holding evaluations are required when holding
   airspeed is less than 280 KIAS. When applicable, provide all restrictions related to turbulent
   air holding to the ATC facility manager. See FAA Order 7130.3, Chapter 3, for additional
   guidance.
1.8. Separating IFPs from Special Use Airspace (SUA) and Adjacent ATC Airspace. To
the maximum extent possible, develop and establish IFP primary obstacle clearance areas, to
include holding patterns, within the lateral airspace boundaries assigned to the USAF ATC
facility. When the primary obstacle clearance area extends into adjacent USAF, FAA or host
nation airspace, advise appropriate ATC facility management. This is normally accomplished
through procedure package coordination. Extension outside of SUA or within adjacent ATC
airspace is permitted when one or more of the conditions in paragraphs 1.8.1, 1.8.2, or 1.8.3
exist.
   1.8.1. The ATC facility with control responsibility for the instrument procedure is
   designated as the controlling agency for the SUA.
   1.8.2. ATC radar is operational and used to ensure separation from the SUA. When ATC
   radar is required, the procedure must be noted appropriately, for example: ATC RADAR
   required.
   1.8.3. A satisfactory airspace usage agreement has been established between the ATC
   facility with control responsibility for the instrument procedure and the controlling agency
   for the SUA. The usage agreement must detail all actions required by both parties to ensure
   separation between participating aircraft in the SUA (or the SUA itself) and non-participating
   aircraft. Note: Coordinate with the local military airspace manager for matters concerning
   SUA.
   1.8.4. Ensure that a SUA check is performed on all procedures developed using GPD (except
   those developed with NATO or PANS-OPS criteria) prior to export (not applicable to ATC
   charts or diverse departure obstacle assessments). When the GPD SUA check indicates a
   violation that is justifiable with one or more of the conditions in paragraphs 1.8.1, 1.8.2, or
 14                                                          AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


   1.8.3, enter the details in the GPD Justification Tab. For example, “IAW AFI 11-230,
   paragraph 1.8.1, XYZ Approach Control is the controlling agency for R-3202A and for the
   instrument procedure.” Completion of the Alternative Tab, Equivalent Tab, or Organization
   Tab is only required when pursuing a waiver.
   1.8.5. To the maximum extent possible, develop and establish IFP primary obstacle
   clearance areas, to include holding patterns, within the lateral airspace boundaries assigned to
   the USAF ATC facility. When the primary obstacle clearance area extends into adjacent
   USAF, FAA, or host nation ATC airspace, ensure the note “ATC RADAR required” is
   charted on the IFP.
       1.8.5.1. The note in paragraph 1.8.5 is not required when an agreement (e.g., LOA)
       between the applicable ATC facilities outlines coordination procedures and control
       responsibilities during non-radar operations. Graphics detailing the penetration or
       overlap of the instrument procedure’s primary obstacle clearance area into the adjacent
       facility’s airspace should be available as support for the agreement.
       1.8.5.2. When developing an instrument procedure in FAA controlled airspace, the FAA
       is responsible for coordinating control responsibilities in the event of radar failure.
1.9. Documenting and Processing Navigational Fixes. Apply requirements established in
FAA Order 8260.19, Flight Procedures and Airspace, specifically; Chapter 2, Section 10,
paragraphs 2-63, 2-64, and 2-65, and Chapter 8, Section 6, Radio Fix and Holding Data Record,
as supplemented by this instruction. Note: When completing the “Reason for Revision” section,
use a “from-to-reason” format. When a fix has moved, document the distance the fix has moved
in ft or NMs to assist flight inspection in determining whether or not the fix needs to be re-
evaluated. Example: “PAT 1 MIN holding altitude changed from 2000 to 3000; new controlling
obstacle.” Note: Obtain and publish a new fix name when moving a fix 1 NM or more unless
operational requirements dictate otherwise (reference FAA JO 7400.2, Chapter 3, Section 3,
paragraph 3-3-4.f.).
   1.9.1. Document data required for holding and for named fixes on the Fix Report Generator
   (FRG) or on the AFFSA generated FAA Form 8260-2. Both documents are available on the
   AFFSA TERPS helpdesk. Note: References are embedded in the FRG for use when
   entering data.
       1.9.1.1. For Non-RNAV patterns, ensure the FAA Form 8260-2 holding pattern value
       entered for “RAD/CRS/BRG” is the same as the “MAG BRG” value used in Fix Make-
       Up at the top of the form. The holding pattern “CRS INBOUND” value will always be
       exactly the same as the “MAG BRG” when holding away from the NAVAID/fix and will
       always be the reciprocal of “MAG BRG” when holding towards the NAVAID/fix.
       1.9.1.2. For RNAV holding; enter the “Inbound Course” that was entered into the GPD
       Holding properties page as the “CRS INBOUND”. The “RAD/CRS/BRG” will always
       be the reciprocal of “CRS INBOUND”.
       1.9.1.3. For non-RNAV procedures; when the MAP is not at landing threshold and
       cannot be designed as a DME fix or with another ground-based NAVAID solution, apply
       FAA Order 8260.19, paragraph 2-64 a.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 15


         1.9.1.3.1. For example; localizer procedures where the MAP is defined as a distance
         from the FAF and timing is used as the sole source to identify the MAP. In this case,
         develop and process a Computer Navigation Fix (CNF), i.e., obtain a non-
         pronounceable 5 letter fix name (beginning with “CF”) via the helpdesk and process
         FAA Form 8260-2.
         1.9.1.3.2. Where there is a DR route defined, establish a CNF at the intersection of
         the DR heading leg and the next segment. Document the CNF on FAA Form 8260-2.
         1.9.1.3.3. In the examples above, GPD will not allow definition of the CNF during
         the IFP design phase, however, the GPD publication report will provide the
         coordinates for use on the FAA Form 8260-2. Annotate this process in the GPD
         designer notes and request charting of the non-pronounceable 5 letter fix name within
         parentheses (CNF).
  1.9.2. Reference IFPs developed for CONUS locations, an FAA Form 8260-2 must be
  processed through AFFSA TERPS helpdesk for each named fix used on the instrument
  procedure prior to flight inspection. Each named fix must be processed by NFDC via NFDD
  for publication in NASR with an effective date that matches the publication date of the IFP.
  Note: Published holding pattern DME leg length fixes do not require naming.
  1.9.3. Instrument procedures developed by the AF at OCONUS locations may be published
  in the DOD FLIP (Terminal) only after all required fix names have been approved by the
  host nation. If the fix name originated from the host nation, include that information in the
  AFFSA TERPS helpdesk incident.
  1.9.4. Reserve all fix names and process all fix actions at both CONUS and OCONUS
  USAF locations as follows:
     1.9.4.1. Open a Fix Processing incident on the AFFSA TERPS helpdesk for each
     requested fix action. Except when requesting or canceling a fix name, attach the GPD
     Build Report, GPD FLIP depiction and any additional source material (IAPA
     spreadsheet, etc…) as supporting documentation. All data on the 8260-2 must be
     supported by source. The incident must indicate the use of Active or Pending facility
     data to define fix make-up. Note: Multiple fix names may be requested via a single
     incident.
     1.9.4.2. When requesting a fix name, AFFSA will obtain the fix name, update the
     helpdesk incident with the reserved name, and close the incident. The requesting
     MAJCOM has 90 days to submit a 8260-2 after fix name reservation. When the
     MAJCOM needs more than 90 days or a reserved fix name is not going to be used, notify
     AFFSA via email. Failure to contact AFFSA at the 90 day point may lead to the fix
     name reservation being canceled and the fix name returned to NFDC.
     1.9.4.3. Submit the FRG or the AFFSA worksheet version of the 8260-2 to the AFFSA
     TERPS helpdesk at least 130 days prior to the proposed effective date via a new Fix
     Processing incident whenever establishing, modifying or cancelling a fix. Note:
     Establish an effective date and select it from the Proposed Effective Date dropdown box
     when submitting a fix for processing on the Helpdesk.
16                                                        AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


     1.9.4.4. AFFSA will process the submission with the NFDC, send the signed FAA Form
     8260-2 to the requestor, and close the incident. The NFDC NFDD cut-off schedule is
     contained in FAA Order 8260.26, Appendix A.
     1.9.4.5. The NFDC will publish new and amended fixes in the NFDD for CONUS
     locations.
     1.9.4.6. For OCONUS locations, the NFDC will not publish new and amended fixes via
     the NFDD but may retain the FAA Form 8260-2 in their internal database for fix name
     tracking purposes.
     1.9.4.7. When publishing host nation procedures in the DOD FLIP (Terminal) and the
     host has not named all fixes IAW US criteria, do not obtain fix names for the host nation
     procedure; publish these fixes as they appear in the host nation source documentation.
     1.9.4.8. When publishing fix names at US locations OCONUS in the DOD FLIP
     (Terminal), the fix name published at the US location shall not duplicate a host nation fix
     name. When made aware that this has occurred, the responsible MAJCOM shall take
     action to rename the US charted fix to eliminate any fix name duplication.
  1.9.5. TERPS authority shall review the NFDD for accuracy and to determine when
  submitted fixes for CONUS locations are established, modified or cancelled.
     1.9.5.1. The NFDD is published daily (except weekends and Federal holidays) by the
     National Flight Data Center (NFDC) and is available through the FAA Facility
     Aeronautical Data Distribution System (FADDS) at http://nfdc.faa.gov/fadds/index.jsp
     or by going to the NFDC website at http://nfdc.faa.gov.
     1.9.5.2. Whenever the proposed effective date changes, notify AFFSA via email.
  1.9.6. When the fix is located OCONUS, obtain approval for publication from the host
  nation prior to publishing the procedure in the DOD FLIP (Terminal). Document this
  coordination.
  1.9.7. When submitting an instrument procedure to NGA for publication or revision, include
  a copy of each applicable, approved (signed by AFFSA, A.N.D., or the FAA), FAA Form
  8260-2 for each fix. When applicable, ensure the procedure effective date (paragraph
  2.10.3) in the NFDD matches the requested effective date sent to NGA. When there is an
  operational requirement to publish an instrument procedure prior to the effective date of the
  fix(es), apply paragraph 2.10.4.
     1.9.7.1. Ensure each Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the Intermediate Fix (IF) are named
     and identified for charting on the planview in the documentation sent to NGA. The IF
     will be indicated on the planview by “(IF)” near the Intermediate Fix. Note: When the
     IF is co-located with the IAF, NGA will chart “(IAF/IF)” near the fix.
     1.9.7.2. When using existing fixes maintained by another organization or MAJCOM on a
     new IFP or when revising a current IFP, submit fix name, IFP name, and airport four-
     letter ID via a new incident to the TERPS helpdesk. AFFSA will update the current FAA
     Form 8260-2 and close the helpdesk incident. For FAA owned fixes, see paragraph
     1.9.8.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   17


   1.9.8. Using FAA fixes on USAF IFPs. Due to increased coordination and processing time,
   using FAA owned fixes on USAF IFPs is discouraged. This includes any action that requires
   a revision to the FAA Form 8260-2 to include adding or modifying holding. When required
   to use a fix owned by the FAA, the responsible MAJCOM TERPS authority must first obtain
   approval from the FAA ATO Service Areas' Operational Support Group, Flight Procedures
   Team (OSG-FPT). HQ AFFSA/A3A maintains the POC listing for OSG-FPT geographic
   regions       on     the      HQ    AFFSA        Airfield    Operations      website      at
   https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/AFFSA/A3A/SitePages/Home.aspx. Include an effective date in
   all correspondence with the FAA. The FAA OSG-FPT will forward the approved request to
   AeroNav Products to ensure all required changes or updates are made to the FAA Form
   8260-2. Note: Do not establish a new fix in the same location as the FAA’s fix to avoid this
   additional coordination.
1.10. NAVAID Service Volume.
   1.10.1. Ensure that a NAVAID service volume check is performed on all non-RNAV
   procedures developed with GPD (not applicable to diverse departure obstacle assessments).
   Consider all flight inspected and any other known restrictions to NAVAIDs when developing
   instrument procedures. All courses and fixes of the instrument procedure shall fall within
   useable radials and useable ranges of the applicable NAVAID.
      1.10.1.1. When any course or fix extends beyond the standard service volume of the
      applicable NAVAID, an ESV evaluation is required.
      1.10.1.2. Holding Patterns. If the primary holding fix is within the service volume of the
      NAVAID, an ESV is not required. ESVs are not require when portions of the holding
      pattern other than the primary holding fix are outside the service volume of the
      NAVAID. Use this paragraph to justify GPD violations for holding inbound points
      beyond the service volume of the NAVAID.
   1.10.2. When an ESV evaluation is indicated for US owned and operated NAVAIDs at AF
   locations CONUS where the AF has TERPS responsibility, the applicable TERPS function
   will access the on-line Expanded Service Volume Request form via the FAA’s public web
   site                                                                                   at
   http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/spe
   c_management/library/esvms.cfm. Download the ESVMS Military Module User Manual
   from the site and follow the directions for registering a new user. After successful
   registration and receipt of credentials by email, follow the user manual instructions for
   entering ESV criteria. Annotate the appropriate NAVAID 3-letter identification and
   frequency. Enter the remaining information on the on-line form as follows:
      1.10.2.1. General Information. Enter the name of the point of contact (POC) and the
      street mailing address in the ‘From:’ space; include zip code. Enter the airspace docket
      number only if the request is associated with an airspace action. The ‘State’ space will be
      auto-filled with the two letter state abbreviation where the NAVAID is located.
      1.10.2.2. Facility Data. Enter the Instrument Approach/Departure Procedure title in the
      ‘Chart Name’ field. For a new instrument procedure, enter the procedure name as
      specified in the flight inspection package. The remaining fields will be auto-filled in
      accordance with data stored in the system.
18                                                         AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


     1.10.2.3. ESV Data. Enter the radial(s) required, the minimum and maximum mean sea
     level altitudes desired, and the nautical mile distances required. Enter all operational use
     requirements that are beyond the standard service volume. Enter altitudes as follows;
     ‘040’ for 4,000 feet and ‘450’ for 45,000 feet, etc.
         1.10.2.3.1. The ‘Requirement’ space is limited to approximately 250 characters. It
         should contain a specific narrative addressing all requirements for flight inspection
         during the ESV evaluation.
         1.10.2.3.2. The ‘Routing Symbol’ space is not used for electronic routing as may be
         expected and is limited to approximately 11 characters. Simply enter the MAJCOM
         office symbol i.e., HQ AMC/A3A.
     1.10.2.4. Submit the completed ESV request by clicking the blue ‘Submit’ button at the
     bottom of the on-line form. When the ESVMS data submission request is successful, the
     system will assign a tracking number.
  1.10.3. After a successful transmission of the ESV request, various email confirmations will
  be received as the request is being routed to the appropriate offices for updating in the
  ESVMS (e.g., the module will show both the date the request was sent to the Frequency
  Management Office (FMO) and the date the request was approved by the FMO, i.e., “SENT
  TO FMO” and “FMO APPROVED.”) Note: Frequency management guidance can be
  found in FAA Order 6050.32, Spectrum Management Regulations and Procedures Manual.
  A phone listing of the FAA Regional Service Area Frequency/Spectrum Management
  Offices                         is                        posted                         at:
  http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/spe
  c_management/locations/fmos.cfm.
     1.10.3.1. Track the status of the request using the tracking number assigned during the
     initial submission to ensure the ESV request has been routed by the Flight Inspection
     Central Operations (FICO) office to the appropriate Flight Inspection Field Office
     (FIFO), i.e., “SENT TO FIFO.” Print a copy of this single page of the module for
     inclusion in the flight inspection package; this serves as a simple reminder to flight
     inspection that an ESV is pending their evaluation.
     1.10.3.2. Once a satisfactory ESV is obtained, official notification will be documented in
     the Flight Inspection Report and the ESVMS module will be updated by the FIFO, i.e.,
     “FIFO APPROVE.” Retain a print-out of the completed and approved ESV (Figure 1.1)
     in the procedure package. Ensure ESV results submitted to the FAA on the applicable
     facility data form are reflected in the FAA’s AVN Datasheet System’s website:
     http://avnwww.jccbi.gov/datasheet/. Note: An ESV requires specific ‘NAVAID
     tuning’ during the ESV flight evaluation. Coordinate all ESV flight inspection requests
     with the MAJCOM NAVAID maintenance office so they can ensure qualified
     maintenance personnel are available during the evaluation.
  1.10.4. The applicable MAJCOM TERPS function will validate requirements for ESV
  evaluations on US owned and operated NAVAIDs at AF locations OCONUS where the AF
  has TERPS responsibility prior to sending an ESV request to the MAJCOM Spectrum
  Management Office.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   19


   1.10.5. ESV evaluations are not required on AF developed IFPs that incorporate segments or
   fixes established beyond the standard service volumes (established in FAA Order 8260.19) of
   host nation owned and operated NAVAIDs.
       1.10.5.1. GPD is not currently performing service volume checks when using
       NATO/PANS-OPS (the “NATO” button in GPD) or ICAO/PANS-OPS (the “ICAO”
       button in GPD) criteria to design an IFP. Future versions of GPD will be programmed to
       perform service volume checks on IFPs developed using these criteria sets.
       1.10.5.2. Until GPD is programmed to perform service volume checks when using either
       of the ICAO criteria sets, a manual service volume evaluation is required to determine
       whether or not an ESV request is required.

1.11. Airspace Action Requirements. Within the US (and where required by host nation
regulations), ensure each IFP’s primary obstruction clearance areas are contained within
controlled airspace. Document all efforts to obtain controlled airspace to support required IFPs.
Where it is not possible to designate controlled airspace, annotate the procedure with an
applicable note. Example note 1: “CAUTION: Procedure not contained within controlled
airspace.” Example note 2: “CAUTION: Uncontrolled airspace below 700’/1200’ (or other
altitude) AGL.” Example note 3: “CAUTION: Uncontrolled airspace beyond/within XX
NM of (airport name) airport.” Note: Consider continuously active restricted areas as
controlled airspace and apply paragraph 1.8.
   1.11.1. Where controlled airspace exists, ensure all IFP altitudes are at least 300 feet above
   the floor of Class E airspace at the final approach fix, in all preceding segments, and in the
   clearance limit holding pattern.
 20                                                         AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


   1.11.2. Where controlled airspace to the surface exists, ensure all circling areas remain
   within the lateral confines of Class D and Class E Surface Areas and extensions to the
   maximum extent possible.
   1.11.3. Advise the AFREP when new or revised instrument procedures require establishing
   or changing airspace.
      1.11.3.1. Establish new airspace or change existing airspace to accommodate new or
      revised instrument procedures IAW AFI 13-201, Air Force Airspace Management, FAA
      Order 7400.2, Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters, and FAA Order 7610.4,
      Special Military Operations.
      1.11.3.2. Coordinate with the local military airspace manager for matters concerning
      SUA.
   1.11.4. Comply with the EIAP program guidance contained in Title 32, Code of Federal
   Regulations, Part 989, Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP). Complete Section I
   of AF IMT 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, to initiate the EIAP when
   making altitude or flight track changes to existing instrument procedures or when developing
   new instrument procedures.
      1.11.4.1. Use the website http://www.gpoaccess.gov/ecfr/ to access the Electronic Code
      of Federal Regulations. Click on the arrow at the first dropdown window and select
      ‘Title 32 – National Defense’ then click on the ‘Go’ button. Select the ‘800-1099’ option
      under the ‘Browse Parts’ column. Scroll down and select Part 989.
      1.11.4.2. As the proponent, pay particular attention to all of the responsibilities outlined
      in 32 CFR PART 989.3(c). Coordinate the AF IMT 813 through the Environmental
      Planning Function at the appropriate level for their evaluation of any effect the new or
      revised instrument procedures may have on the Air Installation Compatible Use Zone
      (AICUZ).
   1.11.5. Retain all coordination and airspace documentation with the IFP.
1.12. Epoch Year Magnetic Variation (MV) Values.
   1.12.1. Comply with FAA Order 8260.19, Chapter 2, Section 5, when implementing,
   maintaining, and updating Epoch Year magnetic variation (magvar) values on USAF owned
   and operated airports and NAVAIDs. Request current magvar for USAF locations via the
   TERPS Helpdesk (paragraph 2.16).
   1.12.2. Notify HQ AFFSA/A3M (hq.affsa.a3m.atcals@tinker.af.mil) when the MV of
   record will change by 3° or more from the currently assigned value. MAJCOMs shall inform
   their applicable supported TERPS functions of the magvar change. The unit will propose a
   timeline and effective date for implementing the new magvar that coincides with a FLIP and
   DAFIF publication date. Allow sufficient time for all agencies to complete their required
   coordination and actions. All effected agencies must agree to the effective date before a
   reasonable timeline can be developed.
      1.12.2.1. The MAJCOM will revise or implement the proposed timeline for updating the
      magvar of the airport or NAVAID(s), to include Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and
      Precision Approach Radar (PAR), and all affected instrument procedures with their
      supported unit(s). The effective date of the change may require additional coordination
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                      21


       when the USAF owned and operated NAVAID is within the NAS or when runway
       renumbering is required. The effective date shall be established with enough lead time to
       ensure all affected NAVAID data and instrument procedures are modified to reflect the
       future Epoch Year magvar value on the effective date.
       1.12.2.2. Once this timeline is established, the MAJCOM shall provide the revised
       magvar value and the effective date to the FAA, NGA and, for CONUS locations, to
       NFDC. The NFDC will ensure publication of the change in the NFDD. When there is a
       need to change the proposed effective date, the MAJCOM will coordinate the new date.
       1.12.2.3. Digital Airport Surveillance Radar (DASR) systems are normally aligned to
       true north. Older DASR systems aligned to magnetic north will be realigned to true north
       by HQ AFFSA/A3MER when the assigned magnetic variation is updated. The
       operations support facility (OSF) will ensure the associated STARS equipment will
       display the proper radar presentation.
   1.12.3. When host nation directives do not provide guidance for processing MV changes at
   USAF installations OCONUS, comply with this instruction to the maximum extent possible.
1.13. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Procedures. When a flight procedure has not been evaluated
to ensure compliance with TERPS criteria and has not been flight inspected, it shall not be flown
in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). These flight procedures are for use under USAF
and ICAO VFR cloud clearance and visibility minima rules as stipulated in AFI 11-202V3,
General Flight Rules, Chapter 7, and AFMAN 11-217V2, Visual Flight Procedures.
   1.13.1. VFR procedures may be published in local flying directives or in a locally-produced
   loose-leaf format; they may also be sent to NGA for publication or charting in loose-leaf
   format.
   1.13.2. When these procedures are developed by an AF instrument procedure designer,
   ensure the notes “CAUTION: For use under VMC only” and “CAUTION: Pilot is
   responsible for terrain/obstacle avoidance” are included in the planview of graphically
   depicted VFR procedures and in each VFR procedure published in textual format.
   1.13.3. VFR procedure identification.
       1.13.3.1. VFR procedures shall be identified IAW FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1,
       Chapter 1, Section 6 as long as the procedure identification also indicates it is not useable
       during instrument meteorological conditions.
       1.13.3.2. For clarity, include (NOT FOR USE IN IMC) in the procedure identification;
       e.g., “SUMTER DEPARTURE (NOT FOR USE IN IMC)” or “TLS RWY 13 (NOT
       FOR USE IN IMC).”
   1.13.4. The entire minima line [minimum descent altitude (MDA), height above
   threshold/height above airport (HATh/HAA), decision altitude/decision height (DA/DH),
   ceiling and visibility] shall be replaced with the single abbreviation: “VFR”.
   1.13.5. VFR procedures published IAW paragraph 1.13 do not require flight inspection or
   waiver action.
1.14. FAA Forms and FAA Publications Guidance.
22                                                        AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013

  FAA websites, they may be requested from the FAA forms officer via commercial fax
  number (202) 267-5407. The FAA forms officer will submit the request to the appropriate
  FAA program office. The program office will provide a copy of the requested form by either
  faxing a hard copy or emailing an electronic copy. Ensure each request to the FAA forms
  officer includes the correct return email address and fax number.
  1.14.2. FAA publications referenced in FAA Order 8260.3 and in this instruction are
  approved for AF use as stated. Example 1; FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1, Chapter 2, Section
  9 refers to FAA Order 7130.3 for holding criteria. Example 2; AFI 11-230 makes reference
  to FAA Order 8260.19 for instructions on filling out FAA Form 8260-2. The first example
  allows application of all criteria within FAA Order 7130.3, where the second example only
  allows application of a portion of FAA Order 8260.19.
  1.14.3. AF TERPS functions shall not apply any guidance or criteria changes in FAA Policy
  Memorandums or TERPS Instruction Letters unless directed by HQ AFFSA via this AFI or
  via message.
  1.14.4. FAA Facility Data Forms.
     1.14.4.1. Complete and maintain the appropiate Facility Data Form IAW FAA Order

         1.14.4.3.3. Complete the Supporting Documents section of the ADC Form by
         uploading the applicable FAA Facility Data Form or the NAVAID data list.
     1.14.4.4. When Terminal Aeronautical GNSS Geodetic Survey (TAGGS) data is
     available, it must be used to complete the applicable facility data blocks. Document the
     specific TAGGS data (survey name, date, etc.) and all other source data used to populate
     the FAA Facility Data Form in the "Remarks" section of the applicable form.. Previous
     facility data forms shall not be considered as source material. Retain all source
     documentation used to complete the form.
     1.14.4.5. Courtesy              copy                 HQ                AFFSA/A3M
     (HQ.AFFSA.A3M.ATCALS@tinker.af.mil) whenever new or revised FAA Facility
     data Forms are sent to the FAA. Retain a copy in the local TERPS files and provide a
     copy to the applicable ATCALS maintenance function and to the Airfield Manager (or a
     designated representative).
  1.14.5. FAA Form 7460-1, Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration. This form
  documents new construction and alterations to current obstructions. Title 14, Code of
  Federal Regulations, PART 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace requires notification
  be provided to the FAA on proposed construction or alteration of structures that might
  present a hazard to flight. Copies of Obstruction Evaluation (OE) case studies and FAA
  determinations     may     be   obtained      from    the     FAA public     website   at
  https://oeaaa.faa.gov/oeaaa/external/portal.jsp. Note: In addition to notifying TERPS of
  proposed obstructions, the FAA and or the AF OE/AAA cell may coordinate notices for
  airport construction or new/modified IFPs at adjacent airports.
     1.14.5.1. The appropriate FAA region will forward FAA Form 7460-1 to the affected
     military installation for evaluation and recommendations by the TERPS function.
         1.14.5.1.1. Evaluate the proposal for impact to current and proposed terminal area
         IFR operations. When the proposal impacts IFR aircraft operations, instrument
         procedures, or minimum IFR altitudes, document all aspects of the impact in detail,
         determine alternatives, and coordinate the results with wing flying officials (AOF/CC,
         OG/CC, Stan/Eval, etc.).
         1.14.5.1.2. Email the results of the evaluation to the OE/AAA cell member office
         within 14 working days of receipt. Cases marked “RUSH” have a 5 working day
         review suspense. Whenever a suspense cannot be met, request an extension from the
         USAF OE/AAA cell member.
     1.14.5.2. The response should clearly state the extent of the impacts and when possible,
     provide acceptable solutions such as limiting the height of the structure to a specified
     height or relocating the structure. Characterize evaluation results as one of the following:
         1.14.5.2.1. “No Objection.” When the evaluation results show no impact to IFR
         operations, notify the OE/AAA cell member that there are “no TERPS objections” to
         the proposal.
         1.14.5.2.2. “No Objection with Provision.” Submit this response when the proposal
         will have an impact on IFR operations unless some mitigating action is taken.
            1.14.5.2.2.1. Suggested mitigation (the ‘provision’) could include lowering the
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   25


              proposed height, relocating the structure, supplying a better survey accuracy, or
              ensuring marking and lighting IAW AC 70/7460-1.
              1.14.5.2.2.2. Include the following statement in the response when the evaluation
              indicates an object may become the controlling obstacle in any segment of an
              instrument approach procedure: “No Objection with Provision: request
              proponent contact (responsible TERPS function) at (enter applicable email
              address) within 7 days of start of construction.”
              1.14.5.2.2.3. After confirming construction has started, take the necessary actions
              to assure all affected IFPs are amended, as required. Note: FAA Form 7460-2,
              Notice of Actual Construction, are available from the FAA public site (paragraph
              1.14.5). Once at the website; click on the “View Supplemental Notices (Form
              7460-2)” tab on the left side of the page.
          1.14.5.2.3. “Objection.” When the proposed construction or alteration will impact
          IFR operations and mitigation is not possible, the response should state an
          “Objection” to the proposal. This response to a proposal should be used as a last
          resort when the construction project will have a substantial adverse impact upon IFR
          flight operations. Clearly define the adverse effect on the IFR aircraft operations;
          quantify the approximate number of operations affected (weekly or monthly). Note:
          Obtain endorsement of this response by wing flying officials (Director of Operations,
          Stan/Eval, etc.).
              1.14.5.2.3.1. Document “Substantial Adverse Impact” (a significant number of
              aeronautical operations being impacted) and the reason(s) why the impact in this
              specific area rises to the level of being significant. For example; an obstruction
              that raises the procedure MDA or DA, penetrates the 40:1 departure surface or the
              visual portion of the final approach 20:1 OIS should be considered substantial
              adverse impact.
              1.14.5.2.3.2. Conversely, an obstruction that requires amending the altitude in the
              intermediate or initial approach segment would not be considered to have a
              substantial adverse effect unless doing so would cause unreasonable descent
              gradients.
1.15. Special Notation Requirements.
   1.15.1. All Category II and III ILS procedures (including FTIP) require the following special
   notation: “CATEGORY II (or III) ILS – SPECIAL AIRCREW AND AIRCRAFT
   CERTIFICATION REQUIRED.” Apply paragraph 2.11 when instrument procedures
   other than CAT II or CAT III ILS procedures are considered special use and require special
   notation.
   1.15.2. Instrument procedures published in true headings or in grid bearings versus magnetic
   headings are nonstandard and require waiver. The following note shall be included in the
   planview of all instrument procedures developed, published, or reviewed by the AF that use
   true headings:       “SPECIAL AIRCREW and AIRCRAFT AUTHORIZATION
   REQUIRED.”
 26                                                         AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


   1.15.3. On charts in the south latitudes where grid navigation is used, only grid bearings
   shall be shown and charts will be oriented to Grid North. The following note shall be
   included in the planview of all instrument procedures developed, published, or reviewed by
   the AF that use grid bearings: “ALL BEARINGS AND DIRECTIONS ARE GRID.”
   Note: Special aircrew and aircraft certification and authorization requirements are the
   responsibility of the flying unit or MAJCOM flying authority. Except for CAT II and CAT
   III procedures, when any special aircrew and aircraft certification or authorization notes are
   annotated on the IFP, a method to contact the unit or MAJCOM flying authority will also be
   annotated on the IFP.
1.16. Climb Gradients (CGs). IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3 and AFMAN 11-217, Instrument
Flight Procedures, Volume 1, the standard climb gradient (CG) for aircraft executing a departure
or a missed approach procedure is 200 ft/NM. When a rate of climb higher than 200 ft/NM is
required for obstacle avoidance or to meet ATC restrictions, the climb rate required shall be
specified on the procedure IAW Inter-Agency Air Cartographic Committee (IACC), NGA and
DOD production specifications.
   1.16.1. Specify a climb-to-altitude (CTA) or fix where the standard CG can be resumed
   whenever a climb rate (obstacle or ATC) higher than 200 ft/NM is published.
   1.16.2. When a CG is required to avoid obstacles, it shall be identified as a “Minimum
   Climb Rate.”
   1.16.3. When a CG is required for an ATC restriction or for noise abatement, it shall be
   identified as an “ATC Climb Rate.”
       1.16.3.1. An ATC CG shall not be published in lieu of an obstacle driven CG that is also
       required.
       1.16.3.2. There may be occasions when it is necessary to publish an ATC CG in
       conjunction with an obstacle driven CG. The ATC CG shall always be greater than the
       obstacle driven CG. Note: ATC CGs may be cancelled by ATC upon pilot request.
   1.16.4. Departure and missed approach CGs greater than 200 ft/NM will also increase the
   slope of the associated obstacle clearance surface (OCS).
       1.16.4.1. The formula used to calculate the slope of the OCS for a departure CG using
       the Standard Formula (paragraph 1.16.6) or for a missed approach using a formula from
       paragraph A4.17.1 or A4.17.2 is 0.76 times the CG (OCSslope = 0.76 × CG). For
       example: The slope of the OCS associated with a 300 ft/NM Standard Formula CG is
       228 ft/NM (0.76 × 300 = 228).
       1.16.4.2. The slope of the OCS for a departure CG calculated using the DOD Option or
       for a missed approach CG using the formula from paragraph A4.17.3 is determined by
       subtracting 48 ft/NM from the CG (OCSslope = CG − 48). For example: The OCS
       associated with a 300 ft/NM DOD Option CG is 252 ft/NM (300 − 48 = 252).
   1.16.5. Missed Approach (MA) Climb Gradient (CG). MA CGs that exceed 200 ft/NM do
   not require a waiver to TERPS criteria.
       1.16.5.1. Calculate MA CGs in the CONUS using the applicable (precision or
       nonprecision) criteria in paragraph A4.17. When a lower CG for locations in the
       CONUS is desired and can be achieved, use the OCONUS criteria from paragraph
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  27


     A4.17.3. When using the OCONUS option at a CONUS location, ensure the procedure is
     annotated “NOT FOR CIVIL USE.”
     1.16.5.2. When an instrument approach procedure is developed for publication with an
     obstacle driven MA CG that exceeds 200 ft/NM, develop identical final and missed
     approach segments based on the same NAVAID to the same runway with an adjusted
     MDA/DA that allows a standard MA CG (200 ft/NM or less).
         1.16.5.2.1. Publish both lines of minima on a single instrument procedure (one line
         of minima will support the MA CG that exceeds 200 ft/NM and the other supporting
         the standard MA CG) or publish two separate instrument procedures. When charted
         on a single plate, label any minima that requires a missed approach CG in excess of
         200 ft/NM as follows: “BELOW MINIMA REQUIRES A MISSED APPROACH
         CLIMB GRADIENT OF XXX FT/NM.”
         1.16.5.2.2. When unable to comply with paragraph 1.16.5.3 by adjusting the
         MDA/DA, develop a separate instrument procedure to the same runway with the
         necessary adjustments (i.e., move the MAP, adjust the MDA/DA, change the MA
         procedure, etc.) to allow a standard MA CG. Identify this second procedure IAW
         FAA Order 8260.3, paragraph 161.a. (e.g., TACAN Z RWY 32).
         1.16.5.2.3. When there is not enough space to chart the required lines of minima on
         one procedure plate, publish two separate instrument procedures (e.g., publish the
         localizer separately from the ILS or publish the TACAN separately from the
         VOR/DME).
  1.16.6. Departure Climb Gradients. Departure climb gradients (ATC or obstacle driven) that
  exceed 200 ft/NM do not require a waiver. Apply the Standard Formula from FAA Order
  8260.3, Volume 4, Chapter 1, paragraph 1.4.1, when calculating departure climb gradients in
  the CONUS. When a lower climb gradient can be achieved and is desired for locations in the
  CONUS, apply the DOD Option from FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, Chapter 1, paragraph
  1.4.1. The DOD Option shall also be applied to all departure procedures OCONUS including
  host nation locations and all OCONUS locations where the AF exercises TERPS authority.
  Note: Whenever the DOD Option formula is used, annotate the procedure “NOT FOR
  CIVIL USE” on the planview of the graphic or in the Delta T ( T ) section of the DOD FLIP
  (Terminal). Annotate in the IFP design notes that the DOD option is being applied. Include
  all manual calculations (clearly indicating which option is being applied) in the IFP package.
  1.16.7. Determine vertical velocity (V/V) for departure and missed approach climb gradients
  that exceed 200 ft/NM. The result of either the Standard Formula or the DOD Option
  Formula establishes the baseline climb gradient used to determine V/V. Climb gradients
  expressed in feet per nautical mile (ft/NM) shall be converted to a climb rate expressed in
  feet per minute (fpm) prior to publishing in the Vertical Velocity chart.
     1.16.7.1. The V/V is determined by dividing the ground speed increment for the V/V
     chart by 60 and then multiplying the calculated climb gradient by the result. Round the
     result up to the next 1-foot increment and publish that value for the 60 knot ground speed
     increment as the V/V.
     1.16.7.2. Example: the V/V for 60 knots based on a computed climb gradient of 253.39
     ft/NM would simply be published as 254 fpm (60 ÷ 60 = 1. 1 × 253.39 = 253.39). The
 28                                                           AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


       V/V for 120 knots based on the same climb gradient (253.39 ft/NM) would be published
       as 507 fpm (120 ÷ 60 = 2. 2 × 253.39 = 506.78). Based on this example, the published
       V/V for 180 knots would be 761 fpm; the V/V for 240 knots would be 1014 fpm, etc.
1.17. Procedural Information. Procedural information includes the following: any fix, radial,
bearing, course, track, distance, altitude, minima, controlling obstacle, holding pattern, climb
table, time/distance table, and changes to any procedure identification, any operational note, or to
any caution note depicted on an IFP. All other information depicted on an IFP or FTIP is
considered non-procedural information. Changes made to procedural information depicted on
any IFP or FTIP are referred to ‘procedural changes’ throughout this AFI.
1.18. Displaced Threshold Procedures. Instrument procedure designers shall revise
instrument procedures as necessary when the threshold is displaced temporarily and operations
will continue to the affected runway. Make adjustments only to those procedures considered
mission essential. Note: Evaluating existing precision instrument procedures with GPD may not
be possible as the location of the displaced threshold may place the GS, the runway point of
intercept (RPI) and Ground Point of Intercept (GPI) into the displaced portion of the runway.
   1.18.1. Enter the amount of threshold displacement, temporary runway length, and the
   displaced threshold elevation into GPD using the Data Manager application. When the
   displaced portion of the runway is not available for departure roll, change the DER of the
   opposite direction runway on the Runway Supplementary Data Tab to match the coordinate
   and elevation of the displaced threshold. Exit Data Manager and run the Auto Eval Tool on
   all mission essential procedures. Note: When the airport elevation was based on the
   displaced portion of the runway, update the airport elevation in the aerodrome properties with
   the new value based on the shortened runway.
   1.18.2. When the Auto Eval results in a glidepath qualification surface (GQS) penetration,
   precision obstacle free zone (POFZ) penetration, lower than standard threshold crossing
   height (TCH) or wheel crossing height (WCH), or when the location of the displaced
   threshold places the GS, RPI, and GPI into the displaced portion of the runway, existing
   precision procedures must be NOTAMed not authorized. The associated localizer approach
   may be used as a stand-alone localizer procedure. Note: When this is the case, coordinate
   with Airfield Management personnel to suspend ILS operations, except localizer only, via
   NOTAM.
   1.18.3. Do not apply credit for the approach lights when determining visibility minima.
   When reverting to no-light minima, ensure the revised MAP to threshold distance is included
   in the NOTAM, when required.
   1.18.4. VGSI systems, i.e., visual approach slope indicator (VASI); precision approach path
   indicator (PAPI); or pulse light approach slope indicator (PLASI), may be unavailable for the
   same reason as the ILS. Ensure the applicable VGSI system is NOTAMed appropriately
   when this is the case.
1.19. Published Altitudes. All published altitudes shall provide at least the minimum required
obstacle clearance (ROC), plus ROC adjustments when applicable, appropriate for the segment
or the sector. This policy applies to all IFP segments, all minimum safe/sector altitude (MSA)
and emergency safe altitude (ESA) sectors and to all ATC chart sectors, regardless of
established altitude rounding guidance. Unless otherwise noted, all altitudes listed in a
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                            29


procedure package will be charted as an “at or above” altitude. Document the rationale for
charting an altitude as an “at” or as an “at or below” altitude.
 30                                                        AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013

       REQUESTING, PROCESSING, PUBLISHING AND MAINTAINING IFPS

Section 2A—Terminal Amendment System (TAS)

2.1. TAS Letter Processing.
   2.1.1. The MAJCOM will send a TAS letter to NGA specifying the effective date when
   submitting a new procedure, deleting a procedure, or when making procedural change(s) to
   an IFP currently published via loose-leaf or in the DOD FLIP (Terminal). Use a separate
   TAS letter in the format specified in Attachment 8 or Attachment 10 for each new or
   amended IFP. Note: Except in extreme circumstances when safety of flight dictates, do not
   request effective dates for SIDs, STARs, or graphic ODPs with center-assigned codes (CID)
   that fall on the change notice (TCN) cycle date.
   2.1.2. A single TAS letter may be used when requesting deletion of multiple IFPs from a
   single location. The letter only needs to identify the airport, the IFP(s) to be deleted, the
   effective date, and a POC. Note: List each IFP being deleted individually in the body of the
   letter.
   2.1.3. Requests to NGA for the initial publication of new IFPs may be limited to a TAS in
   cover letter format that identifies the IFP to be published IAW the documentation attached,
   and a POC. Include a request for NGA to annotate the IFP as original (“Orig”) in the margin
   information, as required.
   2.1.4. When making any procedural change(s) to a currently published IFP, the TAS letter
   will document each change required; multiple changes may be made in a single amendment.
   Assign a number to each amendment, beginning with the number one.
      2.1.4.1. Indicate the amendment number in the procedure properties of GPD and ensure
      the TAS letter requests NGA to change “Orig” to “Amdt 1” or to update the amendment
      number to the next amendment number, as appropriate, on each instrument approach, to
      include radar instrument approaches.
      2.1.4.2. Textual Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODPs) also require the ‘Orig’ or ‘Amdt
      (number)’ notations. With the exception of Host Nation developed IFPs, amendment
      numbers on graphic ODPs and SIDs are not authorized. Name and amend graphic ODPs
      and SIDs IAW FAA Order 8260.46. When publishing Host Nation IFPs, do not modify
      the IFP name to meet the requirements in FAA Order 8260.46. In this case, amendment
      numbers may be appropriate for tracking changes.
      2.1.4.3. When requesting publication of new procedures or when amending currently
      published procedures, ensure the TAS letter specifies the following, as necessary;
      charting of QFE (altimeter setting above station) heights, Special Use Airspace,
      obstacles, coordinate data, operational notes, Approach Lighting System (ALS)
      inoperative notes, etc. Be as specific as possible and include as much data as possible in
      the TAS letter to increase the accuracy of the published procedure.
   2.1.5. Foreign Terminal Instrument Procedures (FTIP). MAJCOM TERPS functions shall
   submit all new instrument procedures and procedural changes to existing procedures to
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  31


   NGA IAW paragraph 2.1 and guidance contained in paragraph 5 of the “Working
   Agreement Between NIMA [sic] and DOD Flight Information Coordinating Committee
   (FCC) On Processing Foreign Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS).”
       2.1.5.1. Process revisions to non-accredited FTIPs IAW paragraph 2.14.           Original
       signatory coordination is not required
       2.1.5.2. Process revisions to special accredited and accredited FTIPs IAW paragraphs
       2.12.3.2 and 2.14. Original signatory coordination is not required.
   2.1.6. When requesting publication of new procedures and when amending currently
   published procedures at all host nation locations (FTIP), ensure the TAS letter specifies the
   charting of one of the four following instrument procedure design rules used by the host
   nation;
       2.1.6.1. TERPS. Procedure designed in accordance with US or former NATO military
       criteria.
       2.1.6.2. MIPS. Procedure designed in accordance with NATO military instrument
       procedures standardization implemented by AATCP-1.
       2.1.6.3. PANS-OPS. Procedure designed in accordance with ICAO DOC 8168, Volume
       II.
       2.1.6.4. NATIONAL XXX. Procedure designed in accordance with national specific
       criteria, with XXX being the ICAO abbreviation for the country, e.g., NATIONAL CAN.

Section 2B—IFP Processing

2.2. Identifying Requirements. The MAJCOM TERPS function shall establish user guidance
for requesting new IFPs and for changing or deleting existing IFPs. Include the following items
(at a minimum) in this guidance:
   2.2.1. Name of the airfield or location desired.
   2.2.2. Type of procedure. Examples: High or Low Altitude, VOR; ILS; and TACAN.
   2.2.3. Runway number(s) of the requested procedure(s).
   2.2.4. Aircraft categories that will use the procedure.
   2.2.5. Special requirements. Detail specific features or capabilities needed, for example,
   termination fix for a departure, fix at which the instrument procedure should commence, and
   avionics features that influence procedure design.
   2.2.6. Date procedure required, and when appropriate, date no longer needed.
   2.2.7. Designation and address of organizations or units requesting the procedure.
   2.2.8. Email address of where to send procedures published via loose-leaf format. Note:
   Procedures published by NGA in the loose-leaf format are not normally coded in DAFIF and
   therefore may not be available for GPS or any FMS using DAFIF.
   2.2.9. The requesting agency may recommend, with justification, the inclusion of existing
   civil IFPs and publication of new IFPs at domestic civil airports IAW FAA Order 8260.32.
 32                                                         AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


2.3. RESERVED.
2.4. Contingency Operations and Deployed TERPS. Process requests to support contingency
operations IAW this chapter and the following:
   2.4.1. The responsible MAJCOM (paragraph 1.6) performing the contingency TERPS
   tasking shall develop and process the required IFP(s). This MAJCOM will also be
   responsible for maintaining the IFP(s) for the duration of the operation.
      2.4.1.1. These procedures can be published in DOD FLIP (Terminal) or in a loose-leaf
      format. Note: Procedures published by NGA in the loose-leaf format may not be coded
      in DAFIF and therefore may not be available for GPS or any FMS using DAFIF.
      2.4.1.2. This MAJCOM shall also be responsible for coordinating all required IFP
      changes with the original requesting agency for as long as necessary to support the
      operation. Timely coordination of changes is essential to flight safety.
   2.4.2. The requesting agency shall provide an email address of where to send procedures
   published via loose-leaf format. The MAJCOM OPR shall forward the appropriate AF IMTs
   to NGA IAW Table 2.1 for loose-leaf publication. Subsequent distribution to aircrews of the
   NGA produced loose-leaf product shall be made by the requesting agency.
   2.4.3. MAJCOM TERPS functions may submit a Crisis/Combat Support request to NGA
   when there is an urgent need. Identify the request as a “TERPS Crisis/Combat Support
   Request.”
      2.4.3.1. NGA will provide a loose-leaf copy of the IFP to the requesting MAJCOM for
      review and approval. The MAJCOM will distribute the final, approved, IFP in the loose-
      leaf format. When the IFP is required on a permanent basis, the MAJCOM may request
      its publication in the DOD FLIP (Terminal) by NGA. Note: Requests for procedures in
      loose-leaf format shall not be used to circumvent the normal production process outlined
      in FLIP General Planning (GP).
      2.4.3.2. When NGA is unable to support a short notice request, MAJCOMs may
      manually produce, locally process, and use the required IFP(s) until the NGA product is
      available. Manually produced and locally published IFP(s) shall be developed to match
      the DOD FLIP format (planview, profile, minima data block, etc.) to the maximum extent
      possible, contain an expiration date, a point of contact, and, if applicable, operation name
      and the unit designation(s) of authorized users.
   2.4.4. Use of NGA provided Stereo Airfield Collection (SAC) data. During contingency
   operations or at locations where standard geodetic survey data sources are not available, the
   use of SAC derived data is permitted to develop special use, nonprecision IFPs. The
   MAJCOM TERPS function must first exhaust and document all efforts to obtain standard
   geodetic data source prior to implementing this guidance. The use of SAC data does not
   make an IFP nonstandard or require waiver processing.
      2.4.4.1. When DTED and DVOF are available for the contingency location, supplement
      this data with SAC data provided by NGA. Obtain the SAC data by requesting a
      “baseline airfield collection” from NGA. This collection consists of an obstacle search
      within the defined airfield boundaries (Figure 2.2) via SAC methodology.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  33


     2.4.4.2. When DTED and DVOF are not available for the contingency location, request a
     “baseline airfield collection” supplemented with an obstacle search that includes the
     military airport surfaces (Figure 2.3). Perform a map study to identify the controlling
     obstacle for each segment of the procedure IAW AFI 11-230, paragraphs 3.15.2 and
     8.4.6.2. Note: Information about airport surfaces can be found in UFC 3-260-01.
     2.4.4.3. When the NGA supplied SAC data does not include a statement of vertical and
     horizontal accuracies, apply standard accuracy values based on the map study when
     entering the data into GPD data manager; otherwise apply the accuracy values provided
     with the SAC data.
     2.4.4.4. When coordinating the instrument procedure with the approval authority, clearly
     identify all SAC derived data (facility, aerodrome, runway, obstruction locations, heights,
     etc.) used to develop the procedure; include any NGA provided vertical and horizontal
     accuracies.
     2.4.4.5. Authorization to fly any special use IFP (paragraph 2.11) developed using SAC
     data is restricted to those aircraft under the operational control of the approving
     commander. The MAJCOM A3 or equivalent will sign the AF IMT 4342 as the “Senior
     Operational Commander”.

2.5. Nonstandard IFPs (Waiver Requests).
   2.5.1. Unless specifically noted within this AFI, deviation(s) from any instrument procedure
   criteria in AFI 11-230, AATCP-1, ICAO PANS-OPS, or from any authorized FAA criteria,
   must be submitted to the appropriate MAJCOM A3 (or a designated representative) for
   approval consideration. This requirement applies to instrument flight procedures published
   by the AF via loose-leaf or in the DOD FLIP (Terminal), and to foreign instrument
   procedures based on non-accredited host nation source published by the AF. Obtain waiver
   approval for nonstandard IFPs prior to flight inspection.
   2.5.2. Procedures developed for the AF by the FAA at domestic civil airports that do not
   meet US TERPS criteria shall be processed IAW FAA Order 8260.32.
   2.5.3. Except for the requirements listed below, MAJCOM authorities will determine waiver
   documentation and processing requirements.
 36                                                         AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


       2.5.3.1. Use of AF IMT 3980, Instrument Procedure Waiver, (paragraph 2.6) is
       required. Multiple criteria deviations pertaining to a single standard or criteria may be
       combined into one entry on the AF IMT 3980.
       2.5.3.2. Each violation listed in the Violations, Warnings, Notes, etc. section of the GPD
       build or publication report must be justified. Each justification for a violation to
       instrument procedure criteria shall specify the reason(s) an exception to criteria is
       required. Phrases such as “Operationally advantageous”, “Provides an operational
       advantage” or “Because the pilots want to do this” will not meet this requirement; a short
       description of the operational gain is needed. For example, when developing holding in
       mountainous terrain: “Holding pattern obstacle clearance was reduced to 1000 feet to
       meet descent gradient criteria between the IAF and the IF”. Each violation that cannot be
       properly justified requires waiver.
       2.5.3.3. Complete documentation and supporting data (Table 2.1) shall accompany the
       waiver request to allow reviewing offices to conduct an evaluation without additional
       research. Include documentation stating the procedure was developed using the most
       current criteria (or the current version of GPD) and the most current aeronautical data.
       2.5.3.4. The waiver authority (MAJCOM A3 or designated representative) may restrict
       or limit the use of a nonstandard procedure. The waiver authority may, at their
       discretion, annotate the planview IAW FAA Order 8260.3b, paragraph 141 or with the
       specific MAJCOM or flying unit approved to use the procedure as follows: “FOR USE
       BY (specific MAJCOM or flying unit(s), exercise or operation, as appropriate) ACFT
       ONLY.”
   2.5.4. Submit a copy of the approved waiver to HQ AFFSA/A3A to facilitate trend analysis.
2.6. AF IMT 3980/AF Form 3980. Use either AF IMT 3980 or AF Form 3980 (GPD
produced) to document violations to instrument procedure criteria and request approval for an
equivalent level of safety as determined by the requesting TERPS function.
   2.6.1. Procedure Name. Also include Airport Name, 4-letter ICAO ID, City, State or
   Country, and, when applicable, the amendment number.
   2.6.2. Specific Directive and Paragraph To Be Waived. Document the specific criteria
   violated and the condition that is creating the violation (i.e., “FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1,
   paragraph 242b(1); intermediate segment for CAT C/D/E aircraft less than 6 NM”). Note:
   Multiple violations to the same criteria may be grouped together and entered as a single
   violation.
   2.6.3. Reason For Waiver (Justification) and Operational Impact, If Not Approved. Be
   specific when stating the operational impact; do not use the fact that a procedure has existed
   for a number of years to justify the waiver. Example: “Historical weather data shows that
   ceilings below 500 feet and visibilities below 2 miles occur approximately 95 days per year.
   At approximately 10 sorties a day, this equals a loss of approximately 950 sorties per year;
   seriously degrading training capability and mission readiness.”
   2.6.4. Alternative(s) Considered and Reason For Rejection. Document the alternative(s)
   considered to eliminate the need for the waiver and state why each was not accepted.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   37


   2.6.5. Equivalent Level of Safety Provided. See FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1, paragraph
   141. An equivalent level of safety is a compensating measure to insure the deviation from
   criteria does not have an adverse impact to the safe operation of aircraft. The TERPS
   function requesting the waiver must establish an equivalent level of safety for each criterion
   deviation included in the request. Provide a statement explaining how the compensating
   measure would provide an equivalent level of safety sufficient to deviate from the established
   criterion without affecting flight safety. An example equivalent level of safety would be a
   warning note published on the procedure. Note: The fact that the criteria violation has
   existed for a number of years does not provide an equivalent level of safety.
   2.6.6. Submitted By. The person that designed or reviewed the nonstandard procedure
   should be indicated in this item.

2.9. Coordination Requirements for Standard, Manually Developed IFPs.
   2.9.1. When the amount of manual computations, drawings, and other hard copy
   documentation required in these packages make it impractical to transfer them electronically,
   process in accordance with Figure 2.1 via surface mail.
   2.9.2. When using paper maps for map studies, apply paragraph 1.5.9 and use current,
   appropriately scaled paper maps for each segment of the procedure as defined in Table 4.1,
   when available. Use the next lowest map scale when the scale required is not available.
2.10. IFP Publication Responsibilities.
   2.10.1. Submit all new and revised IFPs to the NGA FLIP mailbox (taps@nga.mil) IAW
   this AFI, as required, and as shown in Figure 2.1; include required documentation from Table
   2.1.
   2.10.2. Establish an effective date for each new, revised, or cancelled IFP and navigational
   fix.
       2.10.2.1. Coordinate the effective date with all concerned agencies (NGA, NFDC, FAA,
       etc.) to ensure aeronautical charts and supporting data are not published in the DOD FLIP
       (Terminal) until after a successful flight inspection and all published procedural data is
       correct. When necessary, apply paragraph 2.10.5.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                     41


       2.10.2.2. The effective date for IFPs, aeronautical data, and for navigational fixes shall
       coincide with the effective dates established IAW the Aeronautical Information
       Regulation and Control (AIRAC) system. These effective dates can be found in the DOD
       FLIP, General Planning (GP), Chapter 11, paragraph 11-7, Revision Schedules. When
       the effective date needs modification after coordination but prior to publication, establish
       a new publication date and ensure all agencies (NGA, Jeppesen, AFFSA, etc.) are
       advised of the new timeline.
   2.10.3. When unable to comply with paragraph 2.10.3.1, ensure the caveat “EFFECTIVE
   BY NOTAM” is charted on new or revised IFPs when required to publish in the DOD FLIP
   (Terminal) under the following conditions (Note: do not use this caveat for more than 90
   days):
       2.10.3.1. Before all applicable fix names are published in the NFDD.
       2.10.3.2. Before being flight inspected.
       2.10.3.3. Before required waiver approval.
       2.10.3.4. Before DAFIF data is updated to match the data used to develop the instrument
       procedure.
   2.10.4. Issue a NOTAM stating the procedure is authorized for use immediately following
   successful flight inspection, verification that all requested updates to DAFIF have been made,
   waiver approval, or publication of all required fixes in the NFDD, as applicable. The
   NOTAM shall include any changes required by flight inspection or the waiver approval
   authority. All IFPs (except those that can not be coded) require the completion of ARINC
   424 coding prior to this NOTAM action. Note: See AFI 11-208(I) for additional NOTAM
   guidance.
2.11. Special Use IFPs. A special use IFP is defined as a procedure developed and maintained
IAW this AFI for a unique operational requirement and published by NGA. When the special
use IFP is published in a loose-leaf format, the effective start and termination dates must be
indicated in the margin. Note: Once completed by NGA, instrument procedures published via
loose-leaf format are not updated by NGA. All changes or updates, procedural and non-
procedural, to any IFP published via loose-leaf format must be made via a TAS letter to NGA.
   2.11.1. Special use IFPs must state: “FOR USE BY (specific MAJCOM or flying unit(s),
   exercise or operation, as appropriate) ACFT ONLY” in the planview. Note: Other aircraft
   and DOD components may use these procedures only after receiving approval from the
   MAJCOM A3 (or a formally designated representative) responsible for the development and
   maintenance of the procedure (paragraph 1.3.4).
   2.11.2. Special use procedures that do not meet applicable criteria (nonstandard procedures)
   must receive waiver approval prior to being published or used.

Section 2D—Maintaining IFPs

2.12. FLIP Maintenance.
   2.12.1. Establish a Flight Information Publication (FLIP) maintenance system (checklist(s),
   operating instruction(s), etc.) to ensure all IFPs (including FTIP) published in the DoD FLIP
42                                                       AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


  (Terminal) remain current and meet applicable criteria. The supporting MAJCOM TERPS
  function is responsible for maintaining IFPs at locations where a unit instrument procedure
  designer is not assigned or available.
     2.12.1.1. When a unit instrument procedure designer is not assigned or available,
     establish a clear avenue of communication with a POC at the location to enhance timely
     requests for new instrument procedure development or changes to currently published
     IFPs. Each POC must be thoroughly briefed on the specific data (determined by the
     MAJCOM) that needs to be reported to the MAJCOM to keep instrument procedures
     current; pertinent changes to the airfield environment should be included.
     2.12.1.2. MAJCOM TERPS functions shall establish a method to track each IFP, each
     fix, and each waiver to criteria applicable to the IFPs published in the MAJCOM TERPS
     AOR (paragraph 1.6). Also track IFPs developed at domestic civil airports by the FAA at
     the request of the AF or the NGB IAW guidance outlined in FAA Order 8260.32 and
     published in the DOD FLIP (Terminal).
  2.12.2. Initiate GPD Auto Eval on each workspace and all active (currently published or
  pending publication) IFPs after ingest of new aeronautical data (DTED, DVOF, DAFIF, or
  SRTM) or after manual edits are processed.
  2.12.3. When publishing FTIP in the DoD FLIP (Terminal), the MAJCOM should attempt to
  establish a host nation POC to coordinate changes, resolve questions, etc., as necessary, to
  ensure published FTIP are kept current.
     2.12.3.1. Review host nation source documentation when received for procedural
     changes to IFPs published in the DOD FLIP (Terminal). Document all host nation
     procedural changes in a TAS letter and comply with paragraph 2.1.
     2.12.3.2. Check the following source documents on a daily basis:
         2.12.3.2.1. Host nation AIP revisions. Compare new information against the old
         information and against what is currently published in the DOD FLIP (Terminal) or
         posted on the HQ AMC Global Decision Support System (GDSS).
         2.12.3.2.2. US and host nation NOTAMs.
     2.12.3.3. Document all discrepancies found, corrective actions taken, and the review
     completion date in the procedure package.
     2.12.3.4. Maintain as much source information as possible in the applicable procedure
     package.
     2.12.3.5. Whenever possible, perform a full review of host nation source documentation
     in advance of its effective date. Notify NGA of any procedural changes to published
     instrument procedures required prior to the applicable cut-off dates established in DOD
     FLIP, General Planning (GP), Chapter 11, Revision Schedules, for inclusion in the
     appropriate publication cycle. To the maximum extent possible, ensure the DOD
     procedure is published and effective on the same date as the host nation procedure.
     2.12.3.6. When host nation changes will be effective before the next DOD FLIP
     (Terminal) cycle, ensure a NOTAM is issued documenting the required changes to the
     DOD FLIP (Terminal). Notify NGA of the required changes via the TAS letter and
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   43


       either cancel or revise the NOTAM after the changes are published in the DOD FLIP
       (Terminal). Also apply paragraph 3.28.1 when applicable.
2.13. Review of Flight Information Publications and Other TERPS Related Data.
   2.13.1. Prior to the effective date, the responsible TERPS function shall complete a Post
   Publication Review (PPR) of all DOD FLIP (Terminal) and NGA produced loose-leaf
   products where the AF has either maintenance or publication responsibility. A thorough
   review of the initial publication of new or revised IFPs is required to ensure the information
   published by NGA mirrors the IFP as documented by the instrument procedure designer.
       2.13.1.1. When errors are found in procedural information, regardless of the version in
       which the error was made (paper or electronic), take the following actions:
           2.13.1.1.1. Initiate the appropriate NOTAM(s) IAW AFI Interservice Publication 11-
           208, Department of Defense Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) System.
           2.13.1.1.2. Initiate a PPR letter (Attachment 9).
       2.13.1.2. Document FLIP review results IAW specific MAJCOM guidance.
   2.13.2. Annually review revised Base Civil Engineering Comprehensive Planning Maps and
   GIS equivalent and GeoBase CIP Foundations for planned or completed changes in airfield
   layout, facilities, lighting, etc., and new information, to determine the effect (if any) on
   current or proposed IFPs.
2.14. Revising IFPs. Submit revisions to procedural information (paragraph 1.17) on
currently published IFPs to NGA via the Terminal Amendment System (paragraph 2.1). When
a change is made to the graphic depiction of the IFP in either the planview or profile, inclusion
of an annotated graphic is encouraged for clarification.
   2.14.1. Coordinate changes to procedural information with all original signatory agencies
   and offices except as noted in paragraph 2.14.3.
   2.14.2. After the revised IFP has been flight inspected, a NOTAM or a message may be used
   to amend the IFP with the required change(s) prior to it being published in the DOD FLIP
   (Terminal).
       2.14.2.1. Specify the DOD published IFP by name and amendment number in the
       NOTAM for currently published instrument approach procedures or textual ODPs.
       Except for ODPs and SIDs, include “Original” or the applicable amendment number.
       Use the current name of the graphic ODP or SID when amending these procedures via
       NOTAM.
       2.14.2.2. Identify the procedural changes in the NOTAM followed by the phrase “THIS
       IS (procedure identification) AMENDMENT NUMBER (next amendment number in
       sequence).”
       2.14.2.3. Examples:
           2.14.2.3.1. VOR RWY 31 AMDT 6. S-31 MDA 720/HAT 693 ALL CATS. VIS
           CAT C 2, CAT D 2-1/2. CIRCLING MDA 720/HAA 692 ALL CATS. VIS CAT C
           2, CAT D 2-1/2. THIS IS VOR RWY 31 AMDT 7.

         2.14.2.3.2. ILS RWY 10R ORIG. CIRCLING MDA 1420/HAA 559 ALL CATS.
         THIS IS ILS RWY 10R AMDT 1.
     2.14.2.4. Ensure this NOTAM is cancelled when the amended IFP is published in the
     DOD FLIP (Terminal).
  2.14.3. When the only change to an IFP is a change to the controlling obstacle as listed in the
  controlling obstacle table of the GPD Publication Report and no other changes are required
  (i.e., minima increase/decrease, VDP location, descent angle, etc.), full processing of a
  revised IFP package through all signatories is not required. Process this change as an
  amendment as follows:
     2.14.3.1. Update the affected procedure package with;
         2.14.3.1.1. The revised GPD Publication and Build Reports and
         2.14.3.1.2. A new AF IMT 4342 signed as described in paragraph 2.14.3.2 and
         2.14.3.1.3. The updated GPD produced FLIP depiction and
         2.14.3.1.4. All updated flight inspection maps showing the location of the new
         controlling obstacle and
         2.14.3.1.5. An updated FAA Form 8260-2 when the new controlling obstacle is
         located in a holding segment.
     2.14.3.2. Retain the original AF IMT 4342 signature page and the original GPD
     Publication and Build Reports with the procedure package along with the revised AF
     IMT 4342 signature page. The new AF IMT 4342 for the controlling obstacle change
     only needs the following approval authority signatures:
         2.14.3.2.1. The instrument procedure designer
         2.14.3.2.2. MAJCOM TERPS
         2.14.3.2.3. Flight Inspection
     2.14.3.3. Provide written notification (memorandum for record or similar type of written
     notification) of the controlling obstacle change and that no other changes to the published
     procedure are required to the following (retain a copy of the notification with the
     instrument procedure package):
         2.14.3.3.1. Airfield Operations Flight Commander
         2.14.3.3.2. Civil Engineering (Environmental & AICUZ)
         2.14.3.3.3. FAA or Host Nation (when applicable)
         2.14.3.3.4. Senior Operational Commander
     2.14.3.4. Forward a copy of the revised procedure package to the MAJCOM. The
     MAJCOM shall:
         2.14.3.4.1. Review the revised instrument procedure package (perform MAJCOM
         Review as defined in Attachment 1);
         2.14.3.4.2. Process the new controlling obstacle data with the FAA when it changes
         FAA Form 8260-2 holding documentation (as applicable);
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                     45


           2.14.3.4.3. Forward a complete flight inspection package to Flight Inspection.
           2.14.3.4.4. When the controlling obstacle changes in the final approach segment,
           forward a TAS letter as outlined in paragraph 2.1 to NGA for charting of the new
           controlling obstacle. Charting other obstacles is at the discretion of the MAJCOM
           TERPS authority.
   2.14.4. When the only required changes to an IFP are an increase to landing minima, an
   increase to a fix crossing altitude, a change to the VDP location, a change to the descent
   angle, or a change to an operational or caution note, a NOTAM may be issued that amends
   the IFP prior to flight inspection only under the following conditions:
       2.14.4.1. The AOF/CC, OG/CC and the MAJCOM TERPS function, as applicable, are
       notified of the procedural change(s) prior to issuing the NOTAM;
       2.14.4.2. The required change does not create a nonstandard condition. Note: When
       changes are permanent, process a revised procedure package and ensure the NOTAM is
       cancelled when the changes are published correctly.
2.15. Deleting IFPs from DOD Publications.
   2.15.1. When a request to delete an IFP is received, coordinate deletion of the IFP with other
   interested agencies and using organizations (transient and tenant flying units, MAJCOM,
   DOD, FAA, host nation, etc.). Note: Do not consider the absence of a reply as concurrence;
   follow-up with each interested agency or using organization for a response before deleting
   the instrument procedure from the DOD FLIP (Terminal).
   2.15.2. When an FTIP published by the AF is deleted from host nation source (AIP or other
   host document) or after determining an AF developed and maintained IFP is no longer
   required, the MAJCOM TERPS office will send the appropriate TAS letter to NGA, include
   all AFFSA processed 8260-2s for any fixes being cancelled. Courtesy copy this TAS letter
   (include any attachments) to Jeppesen and to AeroNavData.

Section 2E—Data Management

2.16. TERPS Helpdesk. Submit requests for GPD license keys, navigational fix names,
magnetic variation information, information on FAA NAVAIDs (to include magnetic variation
and any other data), initial and revalidation requests for host nation accreditation, and suspected
problems or recommendations for GPD software enhancements to HQ AFFSA via the AFFSA
TERPS helpdesk. When the helpdesk is not operational, contact HQ AFFSA/A5C via DSN 339-
9544 or via email at hqaffsa.a.5.8@tinker.af.mil. AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change
of Publication, may also be submitted via the AFFSA TERPS helpdesk as an attachment to an
incident when requesting changes to AFI 11-230.
2.17. Digital Data. Digital products that support IFP development and review include DAFIF,
DVOF, DTED (Level 1 or Level 2, as required), the NACO digital Visual Flight Rules (VFR)
Sectionals (http://aeronav.faa.gov/index.asp?xml=aeronav/applications/VFR/chartlist_sect),
raster map and imagery products (Compressed Arc Digitized Raster Graphics [CADRG] and
Controlled Image Base [CIB]), and vector products (Urban Vector Map [UVMAP] and Vector
Map [VMAP] 0 – 1), as deemed necessary. Note: Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)
 46                                                         AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


data may be used when DTED is not available or when determined to be operationally
advantageous.
   2.17.1. When used during procedure development, provide updated obstacle data (revised
   description, height, coordinates, etc.) directly to the Imagery and Obstructions Branch of the
   Aeronautical Division (PVA) of NGA via email at: quality@nga.mil. Note: The
   Obstructions Team at PVA is responsible for updating the DVOF database.
   2.17.2. Include updates to DAFIF and any additional aeronautical data used in the
   development of an IFP that are not reflected in the current DAFIF when submitting the TAS
   letter to NGA.
      2.17.2.1. Document airport magvar changes, NAVAID magvar changes, and DAFIF
      updates on the FAA hosted Airport Data Change (ADC) website (https://nfdc.faa.gov).
      Supporting documents may be attached if necessary. Upon receipt, HQ AFFSA/A3OF
      will process the form and the OPR will receive confirmation. Retain the processed copy
      with the IFP documentation. Note: The effective date will be entered by HQ
      AFFSA/A3OF and will be the effective date from the appropriate revision schedule
      published in the current DOD FLIP General Planning (GP) document.
      2.17.2.2. After DAFIF publication, ensure all requested data changes have been made
      and all DAFIF data matches the data used to develop the published IFP. Follow-up with
      NGA to adjudicate and resolve all data discrepancies between DAFIF and corresponding
      data in the GPD publication report on or before the procedure effective date. When
      requested changes to DAFIF are not complete or made in error, notify HQ AFFSA/A3OF
      at: hqaffsa.a3of@tinker.af.mil and take any required NOTAM action. A new
      submission to the FAA hosted Airport Data Change (ADC) website is not required; HQ
      AFFSA/A3OF will re-process the original submission through NGA. Note: DAFIF data
      is used to populate various DOD aircraft navigation databases. When using data other
      than the data contained in DAFIF to develop instrument procedures, the published paper
      product will not match the digital data used by the aircraft for navigation. Tracking
      changes and updating the data in DAFIF when developing IFPs is essential to flying
      safety.
      2.17.2.3. Using GPD Data Manager, import updates to aeronautical and obstacle data
      upon receipt. Note: NGA distributes DAFIF and DVOF every 28 days. DTED and
      other products are updated as necessary by NGA and NACO. Ensure the DTED disk
      being used is current by checking the National Stock Number against the Defense Supply
      Center Richmond web page (www.aviation.dla.mil/rmf/) listing (click on “Digital”) at
      least once every 28 days.
          2.17.2.3.1. Make manual edits as necessary based on OE/AAA case studies, new
          construction, NAVAID changes, host nation AIP changes, NOTAMs, etc. After new
          data is imported, and after manual edits are processed, initiate the Auto Eval Tool to
          check each saved procedure in the workspace to determine whether the data changes
          will require revisions to published procedures. Justification supporting manual edits
          and additions to obstacle data shall be annotated in the GPD Obstacle Properties
          Notes tab. When the Auto Eval tool indicates a change has taken place, restore the
          procedure using Procedure Designer to determine the extent of the changes. When
          procedural changes are necessary, export the procedure and process an amendment.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                    47


          Document the completion of the Auto Eval on the hard copy or electronic Procedure
          Log. Note: Auto Eval checks critical data elements (i.e., minimum segment
          altitudes, courses, violations, etc.) recorded in the electronic procedure file compared
          against the same data elements from a “virtual” build of the saved procedures. It is
          not the same as restoring the procedure. Each time a procedure is opened, it is
          ‘restored’ and re-evaluated based on the current data environment. Auto Eval is
          limited to checking those instrument approach and departure procedures that GPD
          currently supports.
          2.17.2.3.2. Auto Eval does not check ATC charts (MVACs and MIFRACs) for
          changes after data import or after revisions to data. Each saved chart shall be restored
          in GPD Chart Designer after data update or revision and manually compared to the
          previous chart for new sector altitudes and violations.
   2.17.3. Aeronautical dataset differences.      When runway construction, unprompted
   aeronautical database changes, etc., cause data disparities between the IFP build report or
   official source survey data and the DAFIF or AVNIS aeronautical databases, consider the
   following tolerances to the location of the runway threshold when determining appropriate
   NOTAM action:
      2.17.3.1. +/- 50 ft or less longitudinally.
      2.17.3.2. +/- 10 ft or less laterally.
      2.17.3.3. +/- 3 ft or less vertically.
      2.17.3.4. Changes that exceed the tolerances above require immediate NOTAM action to
      ensure safety and procedural currency.
      2.17.3.5. Implement corrective actions to harmonize aeronautical databases, source
      survey data, and flight check documentation.
2.18. Geospatial Information and Services (GI&S).
   2.18.1. Geodetic surveys establish source documentation for obstructions, topographic data,
   and aeronautical data. They are required at all AF owned or operated locations within the
   Continental United States (CONUS) and outside the CONUS where the AF develops and
   maintains terminal instrument procedures (not including FTIP locations). Use current source
   data relating to aeronautical or air traffic control and landing systems (ATCALS) surveys,
   NAVAID and radar siting, obstructions (on- and off-aerodrome), and all correspondence
   relating to manual revisions to aeronautical data. Terminal Aeronautical Global Navigation
   Satellite System (GNSS) Geodetic Survey (TAGGS) data should be used when available.
   Whenever source documentation is not derived from a TAGGS survey, submit the source
   documentation to AFFSA/A3A. AFFSA/A3A will coordinate with NGA for inclusion of the
   source documentation into the TAGGS program.
   2.18.2. AF locations with terminal instrument procedures that have never had a TAGGS
   geodetic survey shall obtain geodetic survey support IAW AFI 14-205, Geospatial
   Information and Services (GI&S), paragraph 10.3.The responsible TERPS function must
   coordinate with local Airfield Management and Civil Engineering authorities to confirm
   items to be surveyed (e.g., runway threshold location, runway edges, NAVAIDs, airfield
   obstacles, etc.) prior to the TAGGS survey. Note: Survey specifications are contained in the
 48                                                           AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


   NGA Airfield Survey Specification Document for the Terminal Aeronautical Global
   Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Geodetic Survey (TAGGS) Program. Current geodetic
   airfield surveys and the Airfield Survey Specification Document for the TAGGS Program
   may        be      downloaded        from      the      following     NGA     website:
   https://aero.geointel.nga.mil/products/taggs/index.cfm.
   2.18.3. Update survey requirements for the following calendar year using the TAGGS
   Priority Spreadsheet posted on the HQ AFFSA Airfield Operations website at
   https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/AFFSA/A3A/SitePages/Home.aspx. NLT 15 October annually.
   Updating this spreadsheet is mandatory for establishing priority and validating the need for
   geodetic surveys.
       2.18.3.1. The MAJCOM TERPS function will coordinate with HQ AFFSA/A3A to
       adjust the survey schedule for their AOR, as required. For example; when proposed
       airfield construction projects conflict with the scheduled survey dates for a particular
       location.
2.19. Master Obstruction Chart (MOC). When establishing a new instrument procedure
program at a location where the AF is responsible for development, publication, and
maintenance of IFPs published in the DOD FLIP (Terminal), a MOC is mandatory. The MOC is
used to assist in the identification of obstructions on or near the airfield that are not normally
included in digital products (e.g., DVOF) used by GPD when no other source of airfield data
(GEOBASE, geodetic airfield surveys, etc.) is available. Note: A MOC is not required when
only developing and using ATC charts at a location and no approach or departure procedures are
developed or maintained by the AF.
   2.19.1. Enter all identified obstacles, terrain points and vegetation into the GPD obstacle
   database unless it has been identified previously via digital ingestion (avoid duplicating
   previously accounted for obstacles). Document the locations and heights of the following
   items within the splays depicted on the MOC consistent with airfield geometry
   (runway/taxiway/ramp layout):
       2.19.1.1. Man-made items (buildings, antennas, light poles, jet blast barriers, etc.).
       2.19.1.2. Taxiing aircraft, parked aircraft, and aircraft parking spots. Add the aircraft tail
       height to the obstacle database with a 3-foot vertical accuracy at the appropriate location
       with a horizontal accuracy equal to at least the fuselage length of the type aircraft.
       2.19.1.3. Terrain points. GPD utilizes digital terrain data from DTED, SRTM, obstacle
       data from NGA produced DVOF, and manually entered terrain and obstacle data. When
       using digital terrain data from DTED or SRTM in GPD, there is no requirement to
       manually search hard copy maps to identify terrain within the MOC. Note: The use of
       digital map products (CADRG, etc.) is authorized to validate obstacle data and terrain
       points only as the values on contour lines are not readable in most CADRG products.
       Ensure terrain lines and obstacles on the border of the trapezoids are considered during
       the manual map study. When available, use the appropriate scale paper map for each
       segment of the procedure as defined in Table 4.1.
       2.19.1.4. Vegetation. GPD has the capability to add a vegetation allowance to the terrain
       model, however the increased MSL elevation for vegetation is not applied to DTED
       within 1.5 NM (2.8 kilometers) around each runway threshold, in precision final and all
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                    49


     visual areas and in the departure ICA (as described in the GPD Operator’s Manual,
     Volume III, paragraph 1.1.5.2.). Because the vegetation allowance is not applied in these
     areas, a manual search for vegetation for addition to the MOC is essential. When
     vegetation is present within the search area covered by the MOC, the location and
     elevation of this vegetation must be identified. Note: Vegetation outside the MOC must
     also be accounted for by adding it to procedure and chart properties or manually entering
     an obstacle (vegetation) with the required allowance.
         2.19.1.4.1. In order to accurately account for trees, determine the maximum height of
         the tallest tree species indigenous to the area by contacting the State Forestry Division
         or host nation equivalent. When desired or necessary, instrument procedure designers
         may reduce the maximum tree height when a lower height can be verified by a
         qualified source or survey (i.e., Forestry Division confirms vegetated area does not
         include largest indigenous tree species, or qualified survey source determines actual
         tree height).
         2.19.1.4.2. When electing to reduce the maximum tree height to a lower height,
         consider annual rate of growth and update the tree or vegetation height annually.
         Document the addition of the annual rate of growth in TERPS records.
  2.19.2. Obstacle accuracies.
     2.19.2.1. When no vertical accuracy value is applied to manually added obstacles, GPD
     will automatically add 125 feet to the top of the obstacle height entered. To prevent this
     automatic addition by GPD, manually input an accuracy value. For example, the
     appropriate authority has provided the maximum height of any tree in a given area as 90
     feet. Add the trees as 89-foot AGL trees with a vertical accuracy of ± 1-foot; GPD will
     then evaluate 90 feet AGL trees.
     2.19.2.2. When deriving data directly from paper map products, apply the appropriate
     horizontal and vertical accuracies from Table 8.4.
  2.19.3. Forward unit developed MOCs to the responsible MAJCOM for review and
  approval. Once the obstacle data (vegetation, buildings, towers, terrain points, etc.)
  identified on the MOC is included in the GPD obstacle database and a copy of the completed,
  original MOC is saved either electronically or hard copy, follow-up maintenance or review of
  the MOC is not required.
  2.19.4. Develop a MOC centered on the aerodrome reference point and extended to include
  the area within 1.5 NM (2.8 kilometers) around each runway threshold or to the perimeter of
  the airfield or to the extent of the CE maps or airport obstruction charts (OCs) whichever is
  greater. Topographical map equivalents may be used to support the obstacle search. Note:
  Digital GIS or Geobase Common Installation Picture (CIP) equivalents to “E-” and “C-”
  series CE maps may also be used for obstacle searches and MOCs.
  2.19.5. When maps are not available for MOC development at contingency locations, create
  a GPD database containing the most current DAFIF, DVOF and digital terrain data covering
  each active workspace. Create a workspace (or workspaces) large enough to encompass an
  area at least 5 nautical miles (NM) beyond the area to be protected for the furthest segment or
  sector of any instrument procedure or chart developed using automation. Document the lack
  of map availability in each affected procedure package.
 50                                                         AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


   2.19.6. Construct a search area using Topographic charts (1:24,000, 1:25,000, 1:50,000,
   1:62,500, or 1:100,000) and Civil Engineering (CE) maps as follows:
       2.19.6.1. Draw a line originating from the ARP extending out to the map edge. Repeat
       the line every 5° until the entire map has been covered (360° – 72 lines).
       2.19.6.2. Construct concentric circles, each centered on the ARP, in 0.25 NM intervals
       (0.25 NM, 0.50 NM, 0.75 NM, 1.0 NM, etc.) outward to the map edge. When the edge of
       the map extends beyond 10 NM, limit this search area to 10 NM from the ARP.
       2.19.6.3. Each 5° by 0.25 NM splay area represents an area for obstacle search and
       identification. Identify the object (obstacle, terrain or vegetation) with the highest MSL
       elevation within each splay area. Objects with an MSL elevation below the lowest
       threshold elevation at the airport may be excluded.
   2.19.7. When a vegetated (tree covered) area is identified within the obstacle identification
   splay, determine the location of the vegetation as the point closest to the edge of the runway
   and identify the obstruction as multiple trees.
   2.19.8. Use adverse assumption when determining the most critical height of un-measurable
   objects (trees, power poles, power lines, etc.). When assumptions are made, document the
   source(s) used to determine the assumed values and retain in TERPS records. When
   evaluating terrain around an above ground object to determine the MSL elevation of the
   object where only the AGL height of the object is reported, ensure hilltops and draws are
   considered; apply adverse assumption by using the ‘one foot less than the next map contour
   line interval’ technique. The following sub-paragraphs illustrate this technique. Note:
   Adverse assumption for vegetation shall be applied, as appropriate, when using DTED and
   map products. Printed or plotted NGA CADRG maps shall not be used in-lieu-of the
   appropriate scale paper map for manual evaluations.
       2.19.8.1. Given the following: map contour interval is 20 feet; the highest contour line
       identified within the applicable map study area is 300 feet; the reported height of the
       object is 100 feet AGL; and the vertical accuracy associated with the object is 25 feet.
       2.19.8.2. The MSL elevation value of the ground used to determine the MSL value of the
       obstacle would be 319 feet (320 – 1 = 319) in this example.
       2.19.8.3. This value is then added to the reported AGL height of the object to derive the
       MSL elevation of the object (319 + 100 = 419). Any vertical accuracy value associated
       with the object must also be added to determine the final MSL value of the object for
       TERPS obstruction considerations.
       2.19.8.4. Using the technique described above with the values provided, the object’s
       final MSL height used to evaluate it for TERPS considerations would be 444 feet MSL
       (319 + 100 + 25 = 444).
2.20. Obstruction Evaluation/Airport Airspace Analysis (OE/AAA). The TERPS authority
must assess the effect of construction proposals upon existing or proposed terminal area IFR
operations (paragraph 1.14.5).
   2.20.1. Obstacles may be ignored when means are established to control its height, location,
   or both. A construction crane or vehicular traffic on a perimeter road equipped with lights
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                             51


  controlled by ATC are good examples. Note: Procedures for control of these types of
  obstacles must be outlined in a Local Operating Procedure.
  2.20.2. Temporarily adding an obstruction to the GPD database for evaluation purposes is
  allowed. Do not amend any IFP or ATC chart based on the evaluation until it is determined
  actual construction has started.

                                           Chapter 3

             FOREIGN TERMINAL INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES (FTIP)

Section 3A—United States Air Force FTIP Acceptance Program

3.1. Program Overview. IAW SECDEF policy, each service has the authority to establish a
process that identifies, maintains, and periodically revalidates a list of nations and specific
airports that meet instrument procedure criteria equivalent to US standards. The USAF FTIP
Acceptance Program implements the SECDEF policy for the AF. This program provides relief
from completing a full review of every host nation instrument procedure prior to being used.
FTIP accepted under this program and published by the AF in the DOD FLIP (Terminal) are not
subject to the instrument procedure waiver process (paragraph 2.5) for any deviation to accepted
standards, i.e., US TERPS, ICAO PANS-OPS, or NATO Military Instrument Procedures
Standardization (MIPS) as defined in Allied Air Traffic Control Publication-1 (AATCP-1).
   3.1.1. Host nation programs, airports, and associated source data that have not been
   evaluated and those that do not meet the guidelines set forth in this chapter are categorized as
   “non-accredited”. These programs and airports are not listed on the USAF Host Nation
   Acceptance List. When published in the DOD FLIP (Terminal), FTIP based on non-
   accredited host nation source require in-depth review and waiver for deviations to standards
   prior to publication in the DOD FLIP (Terminal).
   3.1.2. Completion of the checklist at Attachment 5 (paragraph 3.2.4) by the MAJCOM
   TERPS function is required to assess the acceptability of each host nation program or airport.
   The reliability and accuracy of selected host nation flight inspection and instrument
   procedure development and publication practices are systematically evaluated prior to
   acceptance. Once accepted, host nation civilian airports and military or civilian instrument
   procedure programs are added to the USAF Host Nation Acceptance List.
   3.1.3. The two categories for accepted host nation programs are “accredited” and “special
   accredited.” Individual host nation airports are not eligible for the accredited category but
   may be evaluated for the special accredited category. The approval period for both
   categories (accredited and special accredited) expires three years from the date the approval
   is granted.
       3.1.3.1. Host nation instrument procedure programs and airports may be categorized as
       special accredited only when the AF places a very high degree of confidence in the host’s
       flight inspection practices, and IFP development and publication practices. These host
       nation programs are considered equal to DOD or FAA programs.
       3.1.3.2. Host nation instrument procedure programs may be categorized as accredited
       only when the AF has confidence in the host’s flight inspection practices, IFP
       development and publication practices. These host nation programs produce instrument
       procedures that require completion of the checklist at Attachment 6 when being reviewed
       for posting to GDSS in the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) and prior
       to publishing in the DOD FLIP (Terminal).
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   53


   3.1.4. The responsible MAJCOM TERPS function shall only evaluate and submit candidate
   host nation programs and airports that are within their MAJCOM TERPS AOR (paragraph
   1.6).
      3.1.4.1. Evaluate each country’s military and civilian instrument procedure development
      and publication process separately when each uses different methods, criteria, or
      standards, or when performed by separate offices.
      3.1.4.2. Submit requests for initial accreditation, for program upgrade to the special
      accredited category, for special accreditation of individual airports, and revalidation via
      email to HQ AFFSA/A3A at hqaffsa.a3a@tinker.af.mil or via the TERPS helpdesk.
      Accreditation requests for multiple programs or airports in a single submission will not
      be accepted. Do not submit requests attached to (or part of) another document such as a
      trip report.
      3.1.4.3. Ensure each FTIP acceptance request is approved and endorsed by the
      MAJCOM TERPS function OIC, Flight Commander (or higher), or a formally designated
      representative. Include a statement that indicates all requirements have been completed,
      a short summary of the review results, and any MAJCOM recommendation(s).
3.2. Evaluation and Acceptance Requirements – Accredited Category. In addition to the
requirements in paragraph 3.1, the following requirements apply when submitting candidate
instrument procedure programs for initial acceptance.
   3.2.1. Inform HQ AFFSA/A3A as soon as practical (but not later than 30 days prior to
   submitting a candidate program) that a host nation instrument procedure program is being
   considered for accreditation purposes. Identify the country name and which program (civil,
   military, or both) is being considered.
   3.2.2. Inform the applicable US Defense Attaché Office (USDAO) that a host nation
   instrument procedure program is being considered for addition to the USAF Host Nation
   Acceptance List. Request input from that office reference any concerns they have that may
   discourage acceptance of the candidate program.
   3.2.3. Access information from the following documents (web sites not listed here are listed
   in Attachment 1) and review the indicated documents for data that supports the accreditation
   request and for potential concerns that may discourage acceptance of the candidate program:
      3.2.3.1. FAA International Flight Information Manual;
      3.2.3.2. FAA Notices To Airman-Domestic/International;
      3.2.3.3. Foreign Facilities Approved for Category II/III Operations at
      http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/afs/afs400/afs4
      10/status_lists/.
   3.2.4. Complete the checklist at Attachment 5 and provide supporting documentation used to
   answer each checklist item as follows:
      3.2.4.1. Document all known and declared host civil or military exceptions to criteria
      (i.e., US TERPS, ICAO PANS-OPS, NATO AATCP-1) and flight inspection standards
      used by the candidate program when answering checklist Items 6 and 7. Normally, these
      exceptions are located in the host nation AIP. Note: Host nation exceptions are not
 54                                                          AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


       always declared in the host nation AIP or other host nation source documentation. When
       exceptions to standards are known to exist but are not documented in host source, attempt
       to validate them with host nation instrument procedure and aviation authorities.
       3.2.4.2. A site visit is not required, however, when a site visit is conducted, include site
       visit results or a copy of the trip report, as applicable.
       3.2.4.3. Except for checklist items 1 and 2, validate the answers to checklist items by
       including copies of host source, emails, or hard copy correspondence. When host source
       does not or cannot directly validate the response to a checklist item, provide other
       justification; providing only a checkmark in the appropriate column of the checklist will
       not be accepted.
       3.2.4.4. Documentation shall include a historical listing of any obstacle clearance related
       discrepancies previously discovered as part of the FTIP review or publication process
       while the program was non-accredited. Provide rationale that explains how these
       discrepancies no longer affect safety of flight.
       3.2.4.5. Include representative samples of host nation approach and departure
       procedures; do not submit the entire AIP. Further, submit the following sections from the
       current host nation AIP (or other host nation source that documents the same
       information):
          3.2.4.5.1. GEN 1.7. Differences from ICAO Standards, Recommended Practices and
          Procedures.
          3.2.4.5.2. GEN 2.1. Measuring System, Aircraft Markings, Holidays.
          3.2.4.5.3. GEN 3.1. Aeronautical Information Services.
          3.2.4.5.4. ENR 1.5. Holding, Approach and Departure Procedures.
3.3. Evaluation and Acceptance Requirements – Special Accredited Category. In addition
to the requirements in paragraph 3.2, the following requirements apply when submitting a host
nation’s civil or military program or airport for the special accredited category.
   3.3.1. The program shall have been categorized as “accredited” on the United States Air
   Force Host Nation Acceptance List for a minimum of 24 consecutive months.
   3.3.2. The special accredited category will not be granted for an individual airport or for a
   specific instrument procedure program unless specific justification is provided when;
       3.3.2.1. Host nation source documentation (AIP, FLIP data, NOTAMs, IFPs, etc.) is not
       published in easily understandable English;
       3.3.2.2. Host nation departure procedures are not available from host source
       documentation for review. Note: Review AIP and FLIP products to determine whether
       or not departure procedures (either ODPs or SIDs), as defined in FAA Order 8260.46,
       Departure Procedure (DP) Program, have been established for obstacle avoidance;
   3.3.3. FAA International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) Program. Review the results
   of the FAA International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) Program at
   http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                    55


       3.3.3.1. Although the IASA program does not currently review or apply specifically to
       host nation instrument procedure processes, the results indicate host nation oversight
       capability of their aviation safety program. Since this program assists each country meet
       its obligations under ICAO and provides oversight of each air carrier operating into the
       U.S., the AF will take advantage of these FAA efforts and consider IASA program results
       as a limited part of the special accreditation process for host nation civil programs only.
       3.3.3.2. Civil instrument procedure programs in countries that are rated Category 2 (does
       not meet ICAO Standards) will be provided additional review by HQ AFFSA/A3A
       during the approval process on an “as needed” basis. When requesting special
       accreditation for programs rated Category 2, include justification endorsed at the
       MAJCOM 3-letter level (or above).
   3.3.4. A site visit (not an inspection) by representatives from the MAJCOM TERPS function
   to the applicable (civil or military) host nation’s procedure development office shall be
   conducted. Document the results of the site visit (a trip report format is acceptable) and
   forward to HQ AFFSA/A3A within 90 days of the site visit. Note: The purpose of this visit
   is to become more familiar with the host nation’s IFP processes. To the maximum extent
   possible, review and document instrument procedure designer experience and training, flight
   inspection practices, procedure development standards, and IFP publication processes.
   3.3.5. The request to special accredit an instrument procedure program shall include a
   statement indicating all requirements in paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 have been met unless
   rationale is provided for submitting the program for special accredited category without
   meeting the requirement(s). HQ AFFSA/A3A will make the final decision based on the
   documentation and rationale provided.
3.4. Evaluation and Acceptance Requirements – Host Nation Airports. Individual host
nation airports may only be considered for the special accredited category, regardless of the
status (accredited or non-accredited) of the applicable host nation program responsible for IFP
design and publication at the airport. Include the official airport name and the associated four-
letter ICAO airport identification as indicated in host source in the request.
   3.4.1. Requests for special accreditation of host nation airports shall normally meet all
   requirements as outlined in paragraph 3.3 except for those in paragraphs 3.3.1 and 3.3.3.
   3.4.2. Conduct the site visit (paragraph 3.3.4) to the host nation aviation authority’s office
   responsible for developing that airport’s instrument approach and departure procedures.
   3.4.3. The request shall state that all requirements in paragraph 3.4 have been met unless
   rationale is provided for submitting the airport for special accredited category without
   meeting the requirement(s). HQ AFFSA/A3A will make the final decision based on the
   documentation and rationale provided.
3.5. HQ AFFSA/A3A Acceptance Approval Responsibilities.
   3.5.1. Solicit and consolidate comments from other MAJCOMs, NGA, the United States
   Army Aeronautical Services Agency (USAASA), the Naval Flight Information Group
   (NAVFIG), and from the FAA regarding the suitability of submitted programs or airports, as
   appropriate, based on the accreditation category being requested or revalidated and inform
   these agencies of completed FTIP acceptance actions.
 56                                                           AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


       3.5.1.1. Review and evaluate the documentation provided by the responsible MAJCOM
       and the results of the inquiries to outside agencies. This includes requests for initial
       accreditation of candidate programs and airports and all subsequent revalidation packages
       for accepted programs and airports. The review will be completed within 30 days
       depending on the completeness of the MAJCOM’s submission and the responsiveness of
       the outside agencies.
       3.5.1.2. Provide feedback to the responsible MAJCOM when comments from outside
       agencies reflect negatively on the MAJCOM’s request. Note: The MAJCOM should
       attempt to resolve these issues with the host nation or the commenting agency, as
       necessary, to continue the accreditation process.
   3.5.2. Maintain and distribute the United States Air Force Host Nation Acceptance List
   whenever updates are made to the list.
   3.5.3. Notify the appropriate MAJCOM TERPS function of changes to the status of
   approved host nation instrument procedure programs.
3.6. Maintaining FTIP Acceptance Approval. The responsible MAJCOM TERPS function
shall periodically revalidate accepted programs and airports. Submit revalidation packages to
HQ AFFSA/A3A at any time during the approval period but NLT 30 days prior to the
accreditation expiration date; include all documentation required in paragraphs 3.2, 3.3, and
3.4, as applicable. When required, forward revalidation extension requests to HQ AFFSA/A3A
at least 30 days prior to the accreditation expiration date; include rationale for the extension and
the amount of additional time required.
   3.6.1. Accredited Category. Include a recommendation for the program to either retain the
   current status, or for it to be upgraded or downgraded, as applicable. Failure to conduct the
   revalidation will result in status downgrade and removal from the USAF Host Nation
   Acceptance List without an approved request for extension.
   3.6.2. Special Accredited Category. Include a recommendation for the program or airport to
   either retain the current status or for it to be downgraded, as applicable. Failure to conduct
   and document the revalidation site visit will result in removal of special accredited airports
   from the USAF Host Nation Acceptance List and downgrade of special accredited programs
   to the accredited category without an approved request for extension. Airports will remain
   non-accredited and programs will remain accredited until revalidation requirements are
   completed. Programs downgraded to the accredited category may retain this status for only
   12 months before being removed from the acceptance list unless revalidation is
   accomplished.
   3.6.3. Monitor the FAA IASA Program for changes to a country’s IASA rating.
       3.6.3.1. When a host nation’s civil program is categorized as special accredited and the
       country no longer meets ICAO standards IAW the IASA Program, the responsible
       MAJCOM shall notify HQ AFFSA/A3A and recommend either downgrading the
       program or keeping the program in the special accredited category.
       3.6.3.2. Adequate justification endorsed at the MAJCOM 3-letter level or above is
       required to keep the program special accredited. HQ AFFSA/A3A will review the
       documentation submitted and respond within 5 working days.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  57


   3.6.4. After a host nation’s program or airport is accepted and the MAJCOM becomes aware
   of a condition or identifies a trend that would have precluded the initial approval of either
   category (accredited or special accredited), the responsible MAJCOM shall take the
   following actions:
      3.6.4.1. Special accredited category airports and programs.
          3.6.4.1.1. Notify HQ AFFSA/A3A of the new trend(s), condition(s), or change(s) to
          the host nation program and make one of the following recommendations: to
          maintain the special accredited category; to downgrade a program to the accredited
          category; or to downgrade an airport to the non-accredited category (i.e. remove the
          airport from the acceptance list). Final action will be based on the HQ AFFSA/A3A
          evaluation of the MAJCOM recommendation.
          3.6.4.1.2. When a special accredited program is downgraded to accredited category,
          ensure the checklist at Attachment 6 is completed for all affected instrument
          procedures and that any required procedural changes are sent to NGA via a TAS
          letter.
          3.6.4.1.3. When a special accredited airport is downgraded, the airport reverts to the
          non-accredited category.
              3.6.4.1.3.1. NOTAM all affected instrument procedures “NOT AUTHORIZED”
              until the appropriate review is completed.
              3.6.4.1.3.2. Unless the instrument procedure authority for the airport is
              categorized as accredited (e.g., Mexico civil), pursue all required waiver actions
              on all affected instrument procedures now based on non-accredited host nation
              source.
      3.6.4.2. Accredited category programs.
          3.6.4.2.1. Notify HQ AFFSA/A3A of the new trend(s), condition(s) or change(s) to
          the host nation program and make one of the following recommendations; to maintain
          the current status or to downgrade the program to the non-accredited category. Final
          action will be based on the HQ AFFSA/A3A evaluation of the MAJCOM
          recommendation.
          3.6.4.2.2. NOTAM all instrument procedures downgraded to non-accredited as
          “NOT AUTHORIZED”.
          3.6.4.2.3. Perform a complete TERPS review IAW Figure 3.1 based on a downgrade
          on all affected instrument procedures.
          3.6.4.2.4. Pursue all required waiver actions on all affected instrument procedures
          now based on non-accredited host nation source.

Section 3B—General FTIP Requirements

3.7. Reviewing or Publishing Foreign Standard Terminal Arrivals (STARs). Validate the
following items on foreign STARs to the maximum extent possible according to the
accreditation category of the host nation program that publishes the STAR. When able,
 58                                                        AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


reproduce host nation STARs based on non-accredited source using GPD to assist in the
validation process.
   3.7.1. Special accredited category. When requested, provide a comparison review
   (paragraph 3.19) to the host nation STAR.
   3.7.2. Accredited category.
      3.7.2.1. Ensure the STAR commences at a charted high or low altitude en route fix.
      3.7.2.2. Ensure the STAR terminates at a feeder fix, initial approach fix, or another
      appropriate fix.
   3.7.3. Non-accredited host nation source. Validate the items in paragraph 3.7.2 and the
   following.
      3.7.3.1. Verify altitudes provide obstruction clearance and that Special Use Airspace is
      not violated.
      3.7.3.2. Verify the accuracy of courses, distances, and coordinates.
3.8. Approach Minima Validation.
   3.8.1. When evaluating FTIP for TERPS review or when processing FTIP for publication,
   determine the units of measurement used by the host in their published instrument
   procedures for ceiling, runway visual range (RVR), and prevailing visibility (PV). The same
   units of measurement used by the host must be used in the DOD FLIP (Terminal) product
   and/or documented in the TERPS review.
   3.8.2. When required, compute or validate FTIP ceiling and visibility minima IAW FAA
   Order 8260.3. Compare results with the host’s published value(s) and publish the higher of
   the two. Adjust visibility minima upward when necessary to comply with reportable weather
   values IAW Attachment 2. Note: Changes made to FTIP minima due to rounding or
   adjusting upward to meet reportable values do not require coordination with the host nation.
   3.8.3. For FTIP based on accredited and special accredited host nation source, evaluation of
   the visual portion of the final approach segment is at the discretion of the MAJCOM. Note:
   When this evaluation is accomplished, apply paragraph A3.23 and if a penetration of the
   20:1 OIS is found, notify host nation instrument procedure authorities.
   3.8.4. Apply paragraph 3.8.2 and reproduce accredited and special accredited radar minima
   data as published by the host in the DOD FLIP (Terminal) or in the TERPS review; neither
   GPD or the Attachment 6 checklist is required when reviewing or publishing radar minima
   from an accredited or special accredited source. Note: Review or publication of radar
   minima is at the discretion of the MAJCOM.
3.9. Departure Procedure Validation.
   3.9.1. When host nation obstacle avoidance departure procedures have been established or
   when the host has published one or more SIDs, evaluate the host product(s) IAW this chapter
   for review or publication. When departure information is not evident in host nation
   documentation, close coordination with host aviation authorities may be required to
   determine their method of accommodating departures.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   59


   3.9.2. When unable to verify or validate host nation departure procedure practices (SIDs,
   Omni-directional departures, diverse departure information, etc.) and an AF developed
   method of departure is required to support the mission, apply the following:
      3.9.2.1. Develop an appropriate workspace and accomplish a diverse departure (i.e.,
      omni-directional departure) obstacle assessment IAW Chapter 5 regardless of the
      location’s accreditation category.
      3.9.2.2. Apply paragraph 3.25 and advise the host nation when obstacles penetrate the
      40:1 OCS and establish a departure procedure package.
      3.9.2.3. When the diverse departure (i.e., omni-directional departure) obstacle
      assessment identifies any obstacle that requires a climb gradient to an altitude greater
      than 200 feet above the DER, comply with paragraph 3.9.2.2 and either:
          3.9.2.3.1. Determine the minimum climb gradient to a specified altitude that will
          provide the required obstacle clearance. Example: “Minimum climb of 230 feet per
          NM to 4600”, or
          3.9.2.3.2. When an ODP routing permits a climb within a sector, define the courses
          to remain within in a clockwise (CW) fashion; e.g.,: “RWY 12 – Climb on a
          heading between 061° CW to 228° from departure end of runway.”
          3.9.2.3.3. Combining the options described in paragraphs 3.9.2.3.1 and 3.9.2.3.2 is
          also authorized. Example: “Minimum climb of 350 feet per NM to 9300, climb on
          a heading between 061° CW to 228° from departure end of runway, or minimum
          climb of 260 feet per NM to 8700 for all other courses.”
   3.9.3. MAJCOMs shall establish documentation requirements for host nation departure
   procedures developed with manual methods in a supplement to this AFI. Document
   departure procedures designed with GPD by completing AF IMT 4342, Approach/Departure
   Signature Page. MAJCOMs shall establish approving authority signature requirements for
   these FTIP.
3.10. Metric Minima, Rounding, and Associated Conversions.
   3.10.1. Climb Gradients/Climb Rates/Vertical Velocity. Host nation departure and missed
   approach climb gradients are normally expressed as a percentage. Host nation climb
   gradients of 3.3% shall be considered equal to the standard climb rate for fixed wing aircraft
   of 200 ft/NM. When the published host nation climb gradient exceeds 3.3%, convert the
   climb gradient percentage to a foot per nautical mile (ft/NM) value. Determine the vertical
   velocity IAW paragraph 1.16.7 and ensure the appropriate values are published.
      3.10.1.1. Multiply the host published percentage by 6076.11548. The result is the raw
      ft/NM value; round this raw ft/NM value up to the next whole foot value. The resulting
      value is the host percentage climb gradient expressed in ft/NM.
      3.10.1.2. Example. Convert 5.4% into a climb gradient expressed in ft/NM as follows:
      .054 × 6076.11548 = 328.1102359. This result is rounded up to 329. Use 329 to
      determine the appropriate V/V values.
60                                                         AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


  3.10.2. Descent Gradients. Convert host nation final approach descent gradients expressed
  as a percentage to a descent angle expressed in degrees. Round appropriately and publish the
  descent angle to the nearest 100th degree.
  3.10.3. Descent Angle. Calculate and publish the descent angle IAW FAA Order 8260.3,
  Volume 1, paragraph 252, and as supplemented by paragraph A3.24.
  3.10.4. Rounding altitudes and climb gradients is acceptable when converting from meters to
  feet or when converting host nation climb gradients expressed as a percentage to a ft/NM
  value.
     3.10.4.1. Round minimum altitudes UP to the NEXT, maximum altitudes DOWN to the
     NEXT, and mandatory altitudes to the NEAREST:
         3.10.4.1.1. Enroute - 1000-foot increment; altitude or flight level.
         3.10.4.1.2. Departure procedures, Feeder, Initial, Intermediate, and Missed Approach
         segments – 100-foot increment.
             3.10.4.1.2.1. Clearance limit altitudes specified in departure procedures and
             missed approach instructions shall be rounded to nearest 100-foot increment.
             Other altitudes used in the departure and missed approach should also use 100-
             foot increments.
             3.10.4.1.2.2. When the 100-foot increment causes missed approach and departure
             procedure construction difficulties or changes the intent of the host developed
             procedure, use of 50-foot, 20-foot, or 10-foot increments is authorized. Note:
             These smaller increments are not programmed into GPD for missed approaches
             and will require manual missed approach evaluation or construction methods.
         3.10.4.1.3. Final Approach Fix (FAF), stepdown fix, MDA - 20-foot increment.
         Note: ICAO/NATO MDA – 10-foot increment.
         3.10.4.1.4. DH – 1-foot increment.
     3.10.4.2. In all instances of rounding, ensure the rounded result does not violate the ROC
     of any segment or chart.
  3.10.5. A pressure type altimeter calibrated in accordance with the Standard Atmosphere
  will indicate altitude above MSL when set to a QNH altimeter setting and height above the
  QFE reference datum when set to a QFE altimeter setting. Depict host nation published QFE
  heights in parentheses below the associated QNH altitudes in the DOD published FTIP.
  Note: Refer to AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, Chapter 15, for additional information.
     3.10.5.1. The QFE reference datum is normally indicated on each FTIP and will usually
     be one of the following: the runway threshold elevation; the runway touchdown zone
     elevation; or the airfield elevation.
     3.10.5.2. The difference between the QNH value and the QFE value should equal the
     host published field elevation. When the applicable threshold elevation is more that 2
     meters (7 feet) lower than the field elevation, the difference between the QNH value and
     the QFE value should equal the threshold elevation.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  61


       3.10.5.3. When the host nation publishes MSL altitudes in meters, convert and round
       host nation meter MSL values to a value expressed in feet MSL prior to publication in the
       DOD FLIP (Terminal).
   3.10.6. Metric Altitude Conversions. Apply Table A4.3 when converting metric values. Do
   not directly convert metric QFE values to an equivalent MSL value and then round that value
   prior to publishing in the DOD FLIP (Terminal). When required, derive the equivalent MSL
   foot value of the host QFE value as follows:
       3.10.6.1. Example 1: The reference datum is the field elevation of 34 feet (threshold
       elevation 30 feet). Host publishes a QFE value of 750 meters at the stepdown fix. Do
       not simply divide 750 meters by 0.3048 (750 ÷ 0.3048 = 2460.629921) and publish 2461
       in parentheses. First add the reference datum elevation to the converted value (34 + 2461
       = 2495) to determine the equivalent MSL value. Next, round that result (2495) up to the
       next 10-foot increment (2500) IAW paragraph 3.10.4.1.3. Next, subtract out the
       reference datum elevation from the rounded value (2500 – 34 = 2466). Publish 2500 (US
       QNH) over 2466 (US QFE) in parentheses at the stepdown fix on the DOD procedure.
       3.10.6.2. Example 2: The reference datum is the threshold elevation of 616 feet (field
       elevation 625). Host publishes a QFE value of 750 meters at the final approach fix. Do
       not simply divide 750 meters by 0.3048 (750 ÷ 0.3048 = 2460.629921) and publish 2461
       in parentheses. First add the reference datum elevation to the converted value (616 +
       2461 = 3077) to determine the equivalent MSL value. Next, round that result (3077) up to
       the next 10-foot increment (3080) IAW paragraph 3.10.4.1.3. Next, subtract out the
       reference datum elevation from the rounded value (3080 – 616 = 2464). Publish 3080
       (US QNH) over 2464 (US QFE) in parentheses at the final approach fix on the DOD
       procedure.
3.11. Departure End of Runway (DER) Crossing Restrictions (screen height). Apply
paragraph 5.3.14. The standard ICAO OIS for straight departures begins at the DER at a height
of 5 meters (16 feet). Evaluate host source for nonstandard DER crossing restrictions (screen
heights) for either publication or for a TERPS review; take the following additional actions:
   3.11.1. Use 16 feet above DER as the 40:1 OCS origin height when calculating the climb
   gradient unless the host source documents another height as the procedure design gradient
   starting point.
   3.11.2. Do not approve a screen height lower than published by the host without first
   obtaining approval from the appropriate host nation aviation officials.
   3.11.3. Do not establish DER crossing restrictions or publish a climb gradient (paragraph
   5.3.1) solely to avoid any obstacle(s) identified at the host location as a low, close-in
   obstacle.
   3.11.4. TAS letters to NGA shall include a request to chart host nation screen heights.
   Incorporate all DER crossing restriction instructions in the IFR takeoff minimums or in the
   departure route description, as applicable, describing the Above Ground Level (AGL) and
   MSL restriction in the following format: “Cross DER at or above 20′ AGL/187′ MSL” or
   “Cross DER at or above 16′ AGL/3685′ MSL”.
3.12. Maximum Holding Altitude Determination.
 62                                                         AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


   3.12.1. When evaluating holding patterns based on non-accredited host nation source and the
   maximum holding altitude cannot be determined, evaluate the holding pattern to an altitude
   equal to an ESA or 10,000 feet above the host nation published minimum holding altitude (or
   the published IAF altitude), whichever is greater.
       3.12.1.1. When this evaluation indicates a required change to the holding pattern as
       depicted on the FTIP, either lower the selected maximum holding altitude or select a
       smaller holding pattern (lower airspeed) and re-evaluate.
       3.12.1.2. Continue this process until the selected altitude, the lower airspeed, or a
       combination of both allows use of the holding pattern as depicted on the FTIP. Publish
       the validated maximum holding altitude (and airspeed when required) on the DOD FLIP
       (Terminal). Note: Only publish the maximum holding altitude when required to ensure
       separation from obstacles.
   3.12.2. A maximum holding altitude determination is not required for FTIP holding patterns
   based on accredited or special accredited host nation source.
3.13. Foreign Facilities Approved for Category II and Category III Operations. Host
nation CAT II/III ILS procedures approved by the FAA are posted on the FAA AFS-410, Flight
Operations Branch, web site (paragraph 3.2.3.3). These FTIP are evaluated individually
therefore the FAA approval does not apply to any other procedures or to the ILS equipment
associated with that runway.
   3.13.1. At MAJCOM discretion, CAT II/III ILS FTIP that have been approved by the FAA
   on the FAA AFS-410 web site may be reviewed or published under the guidelines
   established in this AFI for instrument procedures based on special accredited host nation
   source regardless of the accredited category of the host nation instrument procedure
   authority.
   3.13.2. CAT II/III ILS FTIP not on the FAA AFS-410 web site are subject to the review or
   publication requirements associated with FTIP based on the accredited category of the host
   nation instrument procedure authority, as applicable.
   3.13.3. Do not combine host nation CAT I ILS procedures with host nation CAT II/III ILS
   or any other instrument procedure. When the host nation combines CAT I/II/III ILS
   procedures on a single plate, de-combine the CAT I ILS procedure from the CAT II/III ILS
   procedures and publish the host nation CAT I ILS separately in the DOD FLIP (Terminal).
3.14. FTIP Procedure Turns. Chart procedure turns exactly as shown on the FTIP. Include
the fix when the turn starts at a fix, rather than at a time or distance determined by the pilot.
Determine and publish the outbound and inbound tracks on the 45° offset of the 45°/180°
procedure turn (PT) when they are not shown on the FTIP.
   3.14.1. When a “Remain within Distance” is not published by the host nation, coordinate
   with the host nation instrument procedure authority to determine the intended “Remain
   within Distance” for the PT and publish that value in the DOD FLIP (Terminal). Publish an
   appropriate note in the profile view when unable to determine this distance; e.g.,
   “CAUTION: Remain within dist unknown”.
   3.14.2. Determine and publish all appropriate notes and operational information necessary to
   convey the intent of the course reversal maneuver.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  63


3.15. FTIP Master Obstruction Chart (MOC) Requirements.
   3.15.1. Develop a MOC IAW paragraph 2.19 when the AF has requested and obtained
   approval from host nation aviation authorities to develop and maintain one or more IFPs at a
   non-accredited location and the IFP(s) will be published in the DOD FLIP (Terminal). A
   MOC is not required at any host nation location where the AF only reviews or publishes
   FTIP.
   3.15.2. Search for applicable obstacle data to support MOC development in the host nation
   AIP and include this data in the GPD obstacle database. Perform a map study of the host
   nation location and add any additional obstacle (trees, buildings, towers, smokestacks, etc.)
   data into the GPD database. Note: Manually developed IFPs and manually developed IFP
   segments also require a map study that includes all segments of the IFP, to include holding
   patterns, holding pattern buffer areas and each initial approach fix area for man-made
   obstacles, terrain and vegetation.
3.16. Translating FTIP Not Published in English. FTIP published by the host nation in any
language other than English require a complete translation prior to publication in the DOD FLIP
(Terminal) and prior to being reviewed for posting to GDSS in the ASRR.
   3.16.1. The only approved sources for translating information and instrument procedures
   obtained from a foreign AIP are NGA, a qualified translator on the MAJCOM TERPS staff,
   or the USDAO located in the country where the instrument procedure is located.
   3.16.2. Send requests for copies or translation of host nation source documentation to the
   NGA Terminals Procedures Branch at: Host_Source@nga.mil. The subject line of the
   email should include the country name, airfield name, due (D) date, mission (M) date and the
   priority code per paragraphs 3.16.2.1 and 3.16.2.2; this will ensure proper distribution at
   NGA and a timely response. Also include the purpose (either FTIP review or publication)
   for the translation.
       3.16.2.1. Priority Codes. P1 = 1-3 Business Days; P2 = 3-6 Business Days; P3 = 7-14
       Calendar Days; P4 = 15-30 Calendar Days.
       3.16.2.2. Example 1: Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek, D5/13/12, M5/30/12, P2.           Example 2:
       Columbia, Multiple Airfields, D5/13/12, M5/20/12, P1.
3.17. FTIP Flyability Check Requirements. FTIP based on accredited or special accredited
host nation source do not require any type of flyability check. FTIP based on non-accredited
host nation source require an actual (live) flyability check, flown IAW paragraph 4.1, prior to
initial publication in the DOD FLIP (Terminal) unless one of the conditions in paragraph 3.17.1
or in paragraph 3.17.2 is met.
   3.17.1. A Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, PART 121, Operating Requirements:
   Domestic, Flag, and Supplemental Operations, air carrier routinely serves the location.
       3.17.1.1. Contact the US air carrier to determine if special restrictions have been
       established for operating at this airport. Document the results of this inquiry in the
       procedure package.
       3.17.1.2. When the air carrier has established restrictions, obtain and evaluate these
       restrictions to determine whether or not they should be applied to the DOD procedure.
       Note: FAA Order 8260.31, Foreign Terminal Instrument Procedures, requires air
 64                                                         AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


       carriers to provide this information to the AF. When the air carrier does not respond or
       refuses to divulge information, contact HQ AFFSA/A3A for assistance. When
       publication of the procedure is required prior to resolution by HQ AFFSA/A3A, a
       flyability check is required.
   3.17.2. The FAA has flight inspected the instrument procedure.
       3.17.2.1. A copy of this flight inspection report will be considered an acceptable
       substitute for AF IMT 3992 or AF IMT 3993 and shall be maintained with the instrument
       procedure package.
       3.17.2.2. The flight inspection report must specifically state “SIAP verified IAW Order
       8200.1, USSFIM, Chapter 6” or the “SIAP Verified” block must be checked. Rationale:
       there are locations where only the NAVAID is inspected IAW FAA Order VN 8200.3A,
       Policy with Respect to Military Program Procedures for Flight Inspection of Foreign-
       owned Air Navigation Facilities and not the associated instrument procedure(s).
   3.17.3. When one of the conditions in paragraph 3.17.1 or 3.17.2 exists and a live flyability
   check is not completed, a flight simulator or tabletop review is required prior to initial
   publication in the DOD FLIP (Terminal). Document completion of this review on AF IMT
   3992, Instrument Procedure Flyability Check Instrument Approach Procedure (IAP) or AF
   IMT 3993, Instrument Procedure Flyability Check Departure Procedure (DP), as
   appropriate, and retain the signed IMT in the procedure package. When either the
   “simulator” or “tabletop reviews only” block is checked, explain in the comments block why
   this option was used. Example: “Tabletop review conducted due to airport having
   routine 14 CFR PART 121 air carrier operations.”
   3.17.4. Revisions to FTIP published in the DOD FLIP (Terminal) do not require flyability
   checks, tabletop, or simulator reviews.
3.18. FTIP Flight Inspection Requirements. Flight inspection of FTIP is required prior to the
initial publication in the DOD FLIP (Terminal). Revisions made to FTIP after initial publication
in the DOD FLIP (Terminal) do not require flight inspection.
   3.18.1. Flight inspection may be performed by the FAA or by an ICAO certified or approved
   host government or private flight inspection authority. Flight inspections conducted by a
   host nation government or private flight inspection authority are acceptable as long as the
   host nation indicates that the flight inspection authority adheres to standards in FAA Order
   8200.1 or ICAO Annex 10.
   3.18.2. When the MAJCOM has been given the authority to develop and publish IFPs at a
   host nation location, flight inspection is required prior to the initial publication in the DOD
   FLIP (Terminal). Apply paragraph 1.14.4.2, as required.

Section 3C—FTIP Review (Figure 3.1)

3.19. Non-US Government Published FTIP. When FTIP are not published by the US
government, an FTIP review must be accomplished before the host procedure can be flown.
There are two types of FTIP reviews; TERPS review and comparison review. TERPS review is
conducted on the host nation produced instrument procedure; it validates host nation compliance
with the appropriate instrument procedure criteria or standard. Comparison review is conducted
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                       65


between the host nation produced instrument procedure (the FTIP) and the corresponding
commercially produced instrument procedure. This review only validates the reproduction
accuracy provided by the commercial vendor (e.g., Jeppesen®, Lufthansa, etc.), i.e., the
comparison review does not evaluate compliance with instrument procedure criteria or standards.
   3.19.1. MAJCOMs will only perform reviews at locations within their established TERPS
   AOR (paragraph 1.6). Prior to beginning a review, the HQ AMC Global Decision Support
   System (GDSS) Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) should be checked to
   determine whether or not a review has already been accomplished. Submit reviews approved
   by the MAJCOM flying operations authority to HQ AMC for posting to the GDSS IAW the
   HQ AMC MOU, subject: Disseminating Foreign Terminal Instrument Procedures
   (FTIPs) Information via AMC Global Decision Support System (GDSS) at:
   https://gdssams.maf.ustranscom.mil/gdss2web/
   3.19.2. Where a command has no “in-house” TERPS function (e.g., USAFCENT), or when
   the review responsibility is delegated to another MAJCOM (i.e., the reviewing MAJCOM),
   the ORM decision(s) and final approval to use the FTIP shall be made by the flying
   operations authority of the MAJCOM requesting the review (i.e., the requesting MAJCOM),
   or by the command authority exercising operational control of the mission aircraft. The
   requesting MAJCOM shall determine the office in which this authority is vested.
   3.19.3. The original review and approval restrictions are made by the reviewing MAJCOM
   and posted on the GDSS ASRR; all restrictions apply to all AF users of the reviewed FTIP.
   Specific conditions for a given aircraft category may be identified in the review; restrictions
   not identified for a specific aircraft category shall apply to all aircraft categories. Additional
   FTIP review may be performed by another MAJCOM after the original review has been
   posted to GDSS ASRR. When this reviewing command determines supplemental guidance
   is necessary, they may append command specific restrictions to the original review that only
   apply to aircrews under their operational control.
   3.19.4. The review may be waived when the procedure is required for nonstandard
   operations defined as an urgent requirement to fly short-notice, humanitarian, contingency,
   medical evacuation (MEDEVAC), “special” access and urgent State Department missions.
   3.19.5. The requester is responsible for identifying all FTIP and commercially produced
   products requiring review. Establish guidance for FTIP review requests to be directed to the
   MAJCOM TERPS function. Guidance should include the following:
       3.19.5.1. An amount of lead time sufficient to ensure review requests are completed
       before the mission start date. Requests for a single approach or departure should be
       provided to the reviewing MAJCOM at least seven duty days prior to the mission date;
       additional notice would be required when multiple FTIP reviews are requested.
       3.19.5.2. The following minimum review request content:
          3.19.5.2.1. The applicable four-letter ICAO location identifier(s);
          3.19.5.2.2. The airport name(s);
          3.19.5.2.3. Mission start and termination dates;
          3.19.5.2.4. The aircraft category and aircraft instrument capability (e.g., NDB, VOR,
          TACAN, GPS, etc.);
66                                                        AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


         3.19.5.2.5. The specific name of each FTIP required.
  3.19.6. Obtain copies of the applicable host nation’s AIP or terminal FLIP products from
  NGA. These products are available from the Aeronautical Source Packaging System (ASPS)
  at: http://149.8.167.106/. Note: An account and password is required to access this system.
  Do not download host nation instrument procedures from foreign internet web sites.
  3.19.7. When the FTIP review is complete, endorsement of the acceptability of the
  instrument procedure by the MAJCOM Stan/Eval (or MAJCOM determined equivalent)
  function is required. FTIP reviews must include recommendations or limitations from
  Stan/Eval concerning the procedure.
  3.19.8. Document reviews IAW the memorandum format outlined in Attachment 1 of the
  HQ AMC MOU. The review memorandum shall state which segments, if any, were found
  not to meet criteria or standards. Include appropriate comments when the FTIP does not
  meet recognized obstruction clearance or when flight inspection abnormalities are known to
  exist. In conjunction with the MAJCOM Stan/Eval, determine what action (normally an
  operational or caution note) is necessary, if any, to allow the user to compensate for each
  deviation. MAJCOMs shall establish FTIP review package content requirements. Record
  approval and disapproval actions and retain the TERPS review with supporting
  documentation, as applicable, in a procedure package.
     3.19.8.1. HQ AMC/A3AT shall post reviews as received, verbatim, from the reviewing
     MAJCOM (OPR). Any change(s) to the review made by HQ AMC/A3AT shall be
     approved by the OPR prior to the review being posted. When information in GDSS
     already contains the same information included in the completed review, the duplicated
     information may be excluded from the OPR version of the review posted to the GDSS.
     3.19.8.2. The reviewing MAJCOM shall be responsible for informing the requesting
     agency when changes to a review are required. Do not amend a review by NOTAM;
     send revisions to HQ AMC/A3AT for posting to the GDSS.
     3.19.8.3. Each review posted to the GDSS shall have an expiration date clearly indicated
     in the review. Reviewed FTIP will receive continuous maintenance IAW paragraph
     2.12.3 while the review remains effective. Note: When publication of the reviewed
     FTIP is desired, the review expiration date should match the anticipated publication date
     in the appropriate FLIP.
         3.19.8.3.1. When maintenance of the FTIP has been stopped for any reason, and a
         new request for review of the FTIP is received, the review must be re-accomplished
         with a new expiration date.
         3.19.8.3.2. When subsequent requests for a review are made and maintenance has
         been continuous, the FTIP does not have to be reviewed again. For example, when
         the FTIP will be required for an extended period of time or is awaiting publication
         and request(s) are received for the review to be used before the review expires, the
         process does not have to be reinitiated; the current review may be used to satisfy the
         new request.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   67


          3.19.8.3.3. When the requested FTIP is in the TERPS AOR of another MAJCOM
          (paragraph 1.6), the reviewing MAJCOM retains maintenance responsibility until
          the operation or exercise expires or until maintenance responsibility is transferred.
      3.19.8.4. When more than six reviews are required on a particular FTIP over a 12-month
      period, the responsible MAJCOM TERPS function should take steps to publish the
      required FTIP from that location in the DOD FLIP (Terminal).
3.20. Conducting TERPS Review. IAW Figure 3.1 and this chapter, review host nation
produced IFPs with US TERPS criteria. When the reviewing MAJCOM has personnel assigned
that have completed PANS-OPS training, reviews may be conducted using ICAO standards by
the trained individuals.
   3.20.1. Except for PAR and ASR approaches and as indicated in paragraph 3.20.2, all FTIP
   must have a complete TERPS review of all segments; include associated holding patterns,
   landing minima, and minimum sector altitudes. Host nation airway structure does not require
   evaluation. When unable to perform a complete evaluation of a segment using GPD, or
   when GPD does not support the type procedure, review the remainder of the segment or the
   procedure manually.
      3.20.1.1. Evaluate the required host nation departure procedure(s) IAW paragraph 3.9.
      Add the results of the diverse departure obstacle assessment to the review. When the
      assessment does not identify any OCS penetrations, add the following note to the review:
      “No obstacles found that require a climb gradient in excess of 200 feet per NM.”
      3.20.1.2. Also note in the review of the departure: “Rwy XX, Use (NAME of host
      DP/SID) for Obstacle Avoidance/ATC climb rate/noise abatement (as applicable).”
   3.20.2. TERPS review of special accredited FTIP (civil or military) is not required, however,
   the MAJCOM TERPS function may establish TERPS review requirements for this FTIP
   category at their discretion. When requested, provide ceiling and visibility based on the host
   published minimum descent altitude/height (MDA/H) or decision altitude/height (DA/H), as
   applicable.
   3.20.3. TERPS review of accredited FTIP. Use of the FTIP REVIEW and PUBLICATION
   CHECKLIST at Attachment 6 is required. Use of GPD software when conducting the
   TERPS review in conjunction with this checklist is optional.
      3.20.3.1. Complete, sign, and date the Attachment 6 checklist after completing the
      review.
      3.20.3.2. Evaluation of obstacles for ROC is not required except as noted in paragraph
      3.9.2.
      3.20.3.3. Add the results of the Attachment 6 checklist to the TERPS review.
   3.20.4. TERPS review of non-accredited FTIP. Evaluate obstacles for ROC in each segment
   of the instrument procedure. Use GPD to the maximum extent possible when conducting the
   TERPS review.
      3.20.4.1. Manually evaluate any segment(s) that GPD does not support for obstacle
      clearance via map study and report the results in the review. Indicate in the TERPS
 68                                                        AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


       review when deviating from map scale requirements established in Table 4.1; include the
       map scale required and the map scale used.
          3.20.4.1.1. When the appropriate scale paper map products outlined in Table 4.1 do
          not exist or are not available for the map study, and when digital terrain data is not
          available, ensure the procedure is restricted to “DAY VMC”. A live flyability check
          is required prior to the reviewed FTIP being used under IMC.
          3.20.4.1.2. Ensure all segments that have not been evaluated using the appropriate
          scale paper product or with digital terrain data are assessed during the flyability
          check. Conversely, when a 1:500,000-scale map (or a scale with better resolution)
          was used to evaluate the holding pattern, it would not be necessary to have the
          holding pattern evaluated.
       3.20.4.2. Retain the TERPS review in a procedure package with the GPD build report
       until the review expires.
3.21. Conducting Comparison Review. When requested, conduct a comparison review to
determine how accurately the commercial vendor reproduced all of the information and graphics
published by the host nation. Compare each item on the commercial product with the
corresponding item on the host nation product. When this review reveals charted differences
between the commercial product and the host nation product, ensure the differences are
annotated in the memorandum. When the reviewing MAJCOM does not have access to the
requested commercially produced product or when current copies are not readily available from
NGA or from the vendor, inform the requesting agency that a comparison review cannot be
accomplished.

Figure 3.1. Basic Process for Reviewing FTIP.




Section 3D—Publishing FTIP in the DOD FLIP (Terminal) (Figure 3.2)
 70                                                           AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


3.22. Selection. Requests for publication of FTIP in the DOD FLIP (Terminal) should specify
the required instrument procedure(s) by name and location. Obtain copies of the identified
instrument procedure(s) from the applicable host nation’s AIP or terminal FLIP product(s).
Select instrument or radar procedures that satisfy DOD requirements at foreign locations where a
US Government agency is not responsible for IFP development provided:
   3.22.1. The instrument procedure is published in an international AIP or host nation
   produced FLIP product. It may also be acquired as the result of a written agreement (MOU
   or MOA) between the MAJCOM TERPS function and the host nation aviation authority or
   US officials at or representing the host nation location (e.g., the applicable USDAO; local AF
   flying organization, etc.). This agreement shall insure that the MAJCOM is informed of
   changes or revisions made by the host nation as they occur. Host nation source not published
   in an international AIP or host nation produced FLIP product or acquired from the USDAO
   or local AF flying organization without this agreement shall be considered as non-accredited
   IAW paragraph 3.1.1.
   3.22.2. An international aeronautical information service (i.e., NOTAMs, etc.) is available
   for the host nation location.
   3.22.3. The procedure can be safely flown, as depicted or explained IAW paragraph 3.17
   using USAF instrument flight procedures contained in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217.
3.23. Evaluation. When evaluating FTIP for publication, apply the guidance in Chapter 7,
paragraph 7.3. Host nation airway structure does not require evaluation.
   3.23.1. Accredited FTIP. Accredited FTIP published by the AF in the DOD FLIP
   (Terminal) do not require waiver action for any deviation. When the evaluation reveals
   noncompliance with the selected standard, all deviations must be documented in the
   procedure package. In conjunction with the MAJCOM Stan/Eval, determine what action
   (normally an operational or caution note) is necessary to allow the user to compensate for
   each deviation. Address each with an appropriate note in the planview to provide an
   equivalent level of safety. For example; “CAUTION: CAT E short intermediate;
   recommend early configuration.”
   3.23.2. Non-accredited FTIP.
       3.23.2.1. Non-accredited FTIP to be published in the DOD FLIP (Terminal) must have a
       TERPS evaluation (either manual or automated) of all segments (including holding,
       minima, and minimum sector altitudes) completed by the MAJCOM prior to use. When
       performing the evaluation, apply paragraph A3.23.
       3.23.2.2. Initiate waiver action for criteria violations to accepted standards on instrument
       procedures based on non-accredited host nation source. Each violation listed in the
       Violations, Warnings, Notes, etc. section of the GPD build or publication report must be
       justified. Each justification shall specify one or more easily identifiable, written, criteria
       reference that allows the violation. Each violation that cannot be properly justified
       requires waiver.
       3.23.2.3. When the host publishes a straight-in procedure with circling minima and it is
       determined that the host procedure does not meet straight-in criteria, do not publish
       straight-in minima without an approved waiver; the circling minima may be published.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                        71


       3.23.2.4. When the host publishes “circling only” minima and does not comply with
       FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1, paragraph 162, build a circling only procedure and apply
       paragraph 3.28.14 when publishing the procedure.
3.24. Coordination. Obtain approval from host nation aviation or instrument procedure
authorities to develop and publish new IFPs when existing host nation procedures at the airfield
do not meet operational requirements or when there are no host published IFPs at the airfield.
   3.24.1. Coordinate with host nation aviation and instrument procedure authorities when there
   is a need to establish a navigational fix and when a fix name is no longer required. Obtain
   approval for publication of a new fix from the host nation prior to publishing the procedure in
   the DOD FLIP (Terminal). Note: Do not apply guidance from paragraph 1.9 to an
   unnamed host nation fix when publishing the host procedure in the DOD FLIP (Terminal).
   3.24.2. Obtain approval from the host nation as required in this chapter, and when altering an
   existing FTIP except for: higher ceiling and visibility minima; higher emergency safe
   altitudes; higher minimum safe altitudes; when converting metric altitudes to US equivalent;
   and other changes permitted by an established agreement with the host nation.
3.25. Publishing Foreign RNAV Procedures. When unable to determine the appropriate path
terminator from host nation source, do not try to interpret the intent of the host nation or establish
a path terminator for any RNAV segment. When unable to provide NGA with the appropriate
segment path terminator or leg type as published in host nation source data or validated in
writing (email, letter, etc.) by the responsible host nation instrument procedure authority, do not
publish the host nation RNAV procedure in the DOD FLIP (Terminal).
3.26. Publishing FTIP Missed Approach Procedures.
   3.26.1. When a host nation publishes more than one missed approach, publish all of them on
   the DOD FLIP (Terminal). Depict only one missed approach track graphically; all others
   will be published textually.
   3.26.2. When a host nation publishes a missed approach procedure for PAR or ASR
   procedures, publish them in the “RADAR INSTRUMENT APPROACH MINIMUMS”
   section in the DOD FLIP (Terminal).
3.27. DOD NOTAMs on FTIP Published in the DOD FLIP (Terminal).
   3.27.1. When the host nation makes changes to an instrument procedure that are or will be
   effective prior to the changes being published on the corresponding FTIP in the DOD
   publication, correct the DOD procedure by issuing a NOTAM reflecting the changes made
   by the host. When the host changes are extensive in nature or when a full review is not
   possible prior to the effective date of the host source, the DOD procedure shall be
   NOTAMed “NOT AUTHORIZED” as of the effective date of the new host source until the
   review can be completed. When the completed review reveals changes that can be corrected
   by NOTAM, issue the appropriate NOTAM (include required changes) to reinstate the
   procedure and cancel the “NOT AUTHORIZED” NOTAM. When the completed review
   reveals major changes not correctable by NOTAM, keep the procedure NOTAMed “NOT
   AUTHORIZED” until the corrected depiction is published in the DOD FLIP (Terminal).
   3.27.2. Issue NOTAMs on FTIP published in the DOD FLIP (Terminal); ensure the
   requirements in paragraph 2.14.4 are applied. Do not issue NOTAMs on the host nation
 72                                                         AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


   procedure (source) or on any FTIP reviewed and posted to the AMC GDSS IAW this
   chapter.
3.28. FTIP Publishing Package Content and Associated Documentation.
   3.28.1. Ensure all requests for publication sent to NGA conform to requirements in this AFI,
   Table 2.1, and to paragraph 5 of the “Working Agreement Between NIMA [sic] and DOD
   Flight Information Coordinating Committee (FCC) On Processing Foreign Terminal
   Instrument Procedures (FTIP).” Process Special Military Requests as described in the
   working agreement through HQ AFFSA/A3A at: hqaffsa.a3a@tinker.af.mil.
   3.28.2. Complete a TAS letter for each publication request.
      3.28.2.1. Do not use the phrase “Publish per host” or similar phrases when submitting
      FTIP for publication.
      3.28.2.2. Do not combine a request for an obstacle DP in the IFR Take-Off Minimums
      and Departure Procedures (Delta T) section of the DOD FLIP (Terminal) with a request
      for an approach or a SID; a separate TAS letter for each instrument procedure (SID,
      obstacle DP and approach, as applicable) is required. Note: Ensure “Rwy XX, Use
      (NAME of host DP/SID)” is published in the IFR Take-Off Minimums and Departure
      Procedures (Delta T) section.
   3.28.3. Publish all FTIP warning and caution notes. When host nation notes are confusing or
   when publishing translated host nation notes, use good judgment and ensure these notes are
   clear and make sense prior to publishing in DOD FLIP (Terminal).
   3.28.4. Publish all FTIP procedural restrictions. FTIP documentation may be located in
   different sections of the host nation AIP (not directly on the FTIP). Research host nation AIP
   and other host documentation to ensure the DOD published FTIP is complete and accurate.
   3.28.5. Publish minimum safe altitudes, minimum sector altitudes and emergency safe
   altitudes no lower than altitudes specified by the host nation. Combine host nation MSA
   inner ring sectors and sectors less than 90° to meet DOD production specifications.
   3.28.6. Apply paragraph 1.9.9. When the host does not publish or when unable to
   determine IAF or IF intent from host nation documentation, coordinate with host nation
   instrument procedure authorities to determine IAF and IF locations prior to publication in the
   DOD FLIP (Terminal).
   3.28.7. When the host publishes alternate minimums, convert as required to reportable
   values and publish all applicable alternate minima. CAUTION: When the DOD published
   version of the FTIP procedure will include the note “NOT FOR CIVIL USE” (for any
   reason), do not publish alternate minimums.
   3.28.8. Include all FTIP feeder routes and associated data and altitudes. Terminal routes on
   low procedures must include course, distance and minimum altitude values. Addition of a
   route not published by the host or establishing a minimum flight altitude not published by the
   host on a current route requires host nation instrument procedure authority approval.
   3.28.9. Publish all FTIP circling restrictions.
   3.28.10. Add VDPs only if specifically requested and approval for the addition is received
   from the host nation instrument procedure authority.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 73


  3.28.11. Ensure NAVAIDs and holding patterns not part of the instrument procedure but
  depicted on the FTIP are charted on the DOD procedure. These NAVAIDs and holding
  patterns must be specifically identified in the TAS letter for charting as an ATC requirement
  on the DOD procedure before NGA will add them. Note: Host nation ATC may require use
  of these NAVAIDs by DOD aircrews so they must be depicted even though not part of the
  instrument procedure.
  3.28.12. When the FTIP depicts a time/distance table, depict a time/distance table on the
  DOD procedure even when DME is required for the procedure. This allows timing to be
  used as a back up to DME for determination of the missed approach point. When the FTIP
  does not depict a time/distance table and there is no indication on the FTIP or in supporting
  host nation source (AIP, NOTAMs, etc.) that timing may not be used, develop and publish an
  appropriate time/distance table IAW the following:
     3.28.12.1. Convert distances expressed by the host in statute miles or kilometers to
     nautical miles (NM). Round this converted NM distance to the nearest tenth prior to
     publishing.
     3.28.12.2. When the FTIP is published with a time/distance table from the FAF or from a
     stepdown fix to the threshold, determine where the missed approach point (MAP) is
     located. Develop the time/distance table based on the FAF to MAP distance or the
     stepdown fix to MAP distance, as appropriate.
     3.28.12.3. When the host has published multiple stepdown fixes, document and publish
     the time/distance table from the stepdown fix nearest the MAP.
     3.28.12.4. Develop and publish the flying time in minutes and seconds from FAF to
     MAP or from stepdown fix to MAP, as applicable.
  3.28.13. When reviewing data on the FTIP in preparation for publication, compare the data
  to data published on area and enroute charts. Look for discrepancies in altitudes or common
  fix locations that should be the same on all sources. Coordinate any differences found with
  host nation authorities to determine the correct information.
  3.28.14. Do not alter host nation FTIP identification except when de-combining the FTIP to
  meet DOD publication specifications or other publication requirements outlined in this AFI.
  When the identification differs from FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1, paragraph 161 or
  paragraph 162 criteria, document the intent of the procedure. Waiver action is not required.
     3.28.14.1. Example 1. Document the intent as follows: The host nation identifies this
     FTIP as “TACAN/ILS RWY 22” but only provides ILS final approach guidance
     and minima. Publish “NOT AUTHORIZED” in the S-TAC-22 minima block along
     with a line for ILS minima.
     3.28.14.2. Example 2. Document the intent as follows: The host nation identifies this
     FTIP as “TACAN RWY 35” but only provides circling minima. Publish “NOT
     AUTHORIZED” in the S-TAC-35 minima block along with a line for CIRCLING
     minima.
  3.28.15. Document and maintain instrument procedure packages for FTIP based on special
  accredited host nation source by including, at a minimum, the following:
74                                                       AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


     3.28.15.1. A copy of the correspondence requesting publication of the procedure (when
     applicable);
     3.28.15.2. A copy of the TAS letter with instructions to NGA for publication;
     3.28.15.3. A copy of the host published source document (FTIP/STAR);
     3.28.15.4. A copy of all approach minima calculations when the host minima are
     incomplete or not published on the host approach procedure. Include minima
     computations (showing DA/MDA/CMDA, HATh/HAA, ceiling and visibility value
     computations) in the procedure package.     Nonprecision computations may be
     documented on the reverse side of AF IMT 3640, Nonprecision Computations. Note:
     Do not send computation sheets to NGA.
     3.28.15.5. A procedure log. Track procedural changes, reviews, Auto Eval completion,
     and document all other actions taken to keep the instrument procedure current.
     3.28.15.6. Copies of the current and most recent previous NGA produced procedure
     plate. Note: After the FTIP is published in the DOD FLIP (Terminal), the planview and
     profile from the DOD FLIP (Terminal) may be used to assist in illustrating changes being
     submitted to NGA as a procedural change.
  3.28.16. In addition to the documentation requirements in paragraph 3.29.15, document and
  maintain instrument procedure packages for FTIP based on accredited host nation source by
  including a completed FTIP REVIEW and PUBLICATION CHECKLIST (Attachment 6).
  3.28.17. Document and maintain instrument procedure packages IAW Table 2.1 for FTIP
  based on non-accredited host nation source. MAJCOMs shall establish approval authority
  signature requirements for all FTIP. Ensure all FTIP reviewed or developed with GPD
  include approval signatures on the AF IMT 4342, Approach/Departure Signature Page.
  Establish documentation requirements for host nation IFPs developed manually in a
  supplement to this AFI.

                                            Chapter 4

         FLYABILITY CHECK AND FLIGHT INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS

4.1. Flyability Check of Instrument Procedures. IFPs that are flight inspected by the FAA do
not require a flyability check. There are three acceptable types of flyability checks; live
(airborne), simulator, and tabletop. Flyability check requirements for FTIP are outlined in
paragraph 3.17. When the MAJCOM flying authority determines a flyability check is required,
ensure;
   4.1.1. To the maximum extent possible, a DOD aircrew completes the flyability check.
   4.1.2. Compliance with the guidance in Attachment 7.
   4.1.3. It is performed within 120 days of the original request. When the flyability check
   cannot be completed within the allotted time, IFP development must be reinitiated and a new
   flyability check request should be made.
4.2. Flight Inspection of Instrument Procedures. Except as indicated in this AFI, IFPs
developed by the AF for use in IFR or IMC shall be flight inspected IAW FAA Order 8200.1,
Chapter 6. Verbal acknowledgement received from the flight inspection pilot that the new or
amended procedure has passed the flight inspection will suffice for continued coordination of the
IFP until signed documentation is received. Additional requirements for FTIP are outlined in
paragraph 3.18.
   4.2.1. A Flight Inspection Package consists of (in order): Cover Letter, Signature page (with
   POC), graphic, Publication Report, maps, 8260-2s, misc. Submit an electronic copy of the
   IFP package to Flight Inspection. The electronic copy shall be a single, stand-alone (PDF) of
   each procedure (one complete file per procedure to include cover letter). Unless stated
   otherwise in this AFI, each instrument procedure package submitted for flight inspection
   shall contain the following:
       4.2.1.1. A cover letter for each instrument procedure (do not combine multiple
       instrument procedures on the same cover letter). The letter shall contain a requested
       flight inspect by date, points of contact, an address to where the completed package is to
       be returned, and whether or not a departure procedure will be published in a graphic or in
       a textual format. Clearly state whether ‘active’ (A) or ‘pending’ (P) AVNIS data was
       used to develop the IFP Document the Circling Approach Radius (CAR) in this cover
       letter.
           4.2.1.1.1. List all changes to courses/distances/altitudes/ fixes/controlling obstacles in
           a “from-to-reason” format to assist flight inspection determine whether or not the
           change needs to be evaluated via airborne inspection. Example: “LOC MDA
           changed from 500 to 560; new controlling obstacle.”
           4.2.1.1.2. When underlying data has changed due to a new survey but no NAVAIDs
           were physically moved, include a general statement to address the data changes in the
           cover letter. Example: “New survey - some coordinates and elevations have changed
           slightly to include HATh and HAA values.”
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  77


      4.2.1.2. A copy of the GPD publication report, and when requested, a copy of the
      procedure build report from GPD.
      4.2.1.3. Required maps. 1:100,000 scale planimetric or topographical charts are
      recommended. Manually produced segments must be drawn or traced directly on the
      chart. Do not send a single map for multiple procedures. Highlight the controlling
      obstacles on the map to make them easy to locate. Identify the controlling obstacles on
      the map with the GPD output reference number so that they correlate to the controlling
      obstacles listed on the approach or departure procedure publication report (as indicated
      on the sample controlling obstacle template in Figure 4.1). Attach a controlling obstacle
      template to the map.

Figure 4.1. Sample Controlling Obstacle Template (approach procedure).




      4.2.1.4. Graphic depiction of the procedure. This depiction may be drawn separately and
      included in the procedure package in the form of an attachment or as produced by GPD.
      IFP packages must include a graphic depiction of the procedure. The depiction may be a
      copy of the existing NGA graphic with changes added (penned in), a new GPD FLIP
      graphic depiction, or the host produced graphic obtained from the host nation AIP. All
      procedures shall have both the magnetic courses and true courses depicted in the plan and
      profile views. The true course shall be depicted within parenthesis directly above or
      below the magnetic course, e.g.: (240°T). When developing an IFP, the TERPS function
      may produce a draft product for review and coordination purposes. One of the following
      notes shall be published on the planview of the draft procedure: “NOT FOR
      NAVIGATIONAL USE” or “FOR USE BY FLYABILITY OR FLIGHT CHECK
      AIRCREW ONLY.”
      4.2.1.5. Each applicable FAA Form 8260-2. When there are no changes to the FAA
      Form 8260-2 and it does not require flight inspection action, annotate on the form that it
      is “For Information Only.”
      4.2.1.6. ESV request (when applicable).
 78                                                         AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


      4.2.1.7. Approved AF IMT 3980 (when applicable).
      4.2.1.8. Any additional information to aid the flight inspection process.
   4.2.2. Submit an electronic copy of the IFP package to Flight Inspection no later than 45
   calendar days prior to the requested flight inspection date. Identify requested flight check by
   date on cover letter (see para 4.2.1.1).
   4.2.3. Contingency and short-notice flight inspections shall be coordinated with the flight
   inspection office as soon as possible. Flight inspection requirements in overseas theaters
   may be delayed or prohibited due to country clearances and diplomatic visa requests. Note:
   The Flight Inspection Central Operations (FICO) schedules international flight inspections
   three months in advance; earliest possible notification of potential flight inspection
   requirements at OCONUS locations will improve the ability for flight inspection to respond
   in a timely manner.
   4.2.4. The FICO provides centralized scheduling, coordination, flight planning, and flight
   following for flight inspection activities.
      4.2.4.1. If required, mail flight inspection requests and packages to the FICO at:
   MMAC AJW-391

   Flight Inspection Central Operations

   6500 S. MacArthur Blvd.

   Bldg. #4, Room 132

   Oklahoma City, OK 73169
Note: The FICO email address is: 9-AMC-FI-PROCEDURES@faa.gov.
      4.2.4.2. To ensure request and package receipt and that the flight inspection is scheduled,
      contact the FAA Operations Support Office (9-AMC-FI-PROCEDURES@faa.gov).
      Additional             information               is              available              at:
      http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/avn/flightinspection/.
4.3. Flight Inspection of Special Use Instrument Procedures.
   4.3.1. Standard, special use instrument procedures (paragraph 2.11) do not require flight
   inspection when all of the following conditions can be met to achieve an equivalent level of
   safety:
      4.3.1.1. The special use procedure has received a live (airborne) flyability check that
      verifies the controlling obstacle and NAVAID reception in each segment of the
      procedure. Note: The controlling obstacle verification must be briefed to the aircrew
      prior to performing the flyability check sortie and the flyability check IMT must be
      annotated by the flyability check crew that this was completed satisfactorily.
      4.3.1.2. The special use procedure uses NAVAIDs that have been flight inspected
      according to FAA Order 8200.1 or ICAO Annex 10. This restriction does not apply to
      Airborne Radar Approach (ARA) procedures.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   79


      4.3.1.3. All segments and all fixes depicted on holding patterns of the special use
      procedure are within the standard service volume of the applicable ground-based
      NAVAID(s). This restriction does not apply to ARA, ASR or PAR procedures.
      4.3.1.4. The note “ATC RADAR monitoring required” is clearly indicated on the
      planview of the IFP. Note: This note is not required on ARA procedures.
   4.3.2. The MAJCOM Commander (CC), the JFACC, the CFACC, or equivalent, may waive
   flight inspection whenever use of a standard or nonstandard, special use, IFP is essential due
   to a military emergency or an urgent military necessity. This authorization only applies to
   those aircraft under operational control of the authorizing MAJCOM Commander,
   JFACC/CFACC (or equivalent). The planview of the instrument procedure shall be
   annotated with the specific MAJCOM or flying unit approved to use the procedure as
   follows: “FOR USE BY (specific MAJCOM or flying unit(s), exercise or operation, as
   appropriate) ACFT ONLY.”
   4.3.3. When the procedure is nonstandard or when all the requirements of paragraph 4.3.1
   cannot be fulfilled, the procedure requires flight inspection.
   4.3.4. Flight inspection of special use procedures based on host nation source conducted by
   the host country (not conducted by the FAA) is acceptable as long as the host nation indicates
   that their instrument procedures are flight inspected and that the flight inspection authority
   adheres to either FAA Order 8200.1 or ICAO Annex 10.

                      INSTRUMENT DEPARTURE PROCEDURES

5.1. Departure Procedure (DP) Development Guidance. Develop departure procedures (DPs)
IAW FAA Order 8260.44, Civil Utilization of Area Navigation (RNAV) Departure Procedures;
FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4; FAA Order 8260.46, Departure Procedure (DP) Program and
FAA Order 8260.53, Standard Instrument Departures That Use Radar Vectors to Join RNAV
Routes only when specifically indicated or supplemented in this chapter. To the extent possible,
use GPD when developing departure procedures. When required, develop DPs manually.
   5.1.1. DPs developed to communicate ATC clearances are referred to as Standard Instrument
   Departures (SIDs).
   5.1.2. DPs developed to assist pilots in obstacle avoidance are referred to as Obstacle
   Departure Procedures (ODPs). Establish only one ODP (paragraph 5.3.14) per runway.
   5.1.3. All DPs are subject to flight inspection except as noted in paragraph 4.3.1.
   5.1.4. Publication of a SID does not eliminate the need to publish an ODP when 40:1 OCS
   penetrations exist. The Delta T symbol ( T ) will be published on all instrument approach and
   departure procedures at an airfield when the diverse departure obstacle assessment results in
   penetrations to the 40:1 OCS. Note: Except as outlined in Chapter 3, a SID shall not be
   identified or used as an ODP in the DOD FLIP (Terminal).
   5.1.5. Establishment of ESAs and MSAs for graphic DPs is authorized. Note: Reference
   RNAV procedures, except for departures, establish the ESA and MSA center on the MAWP;
   for RNAV departures, use the DER.
   5.1.6. Arc segments should not be used when developing departure procedures. When an
   operational requirement exists to develop a DP with an arc segment, the aircraft must be at or
   above the MVA prior to starting the arc. Use the highest MVA elevation along the entire arc
   segment OIS as the beginning arc altitude. Arcing departures are nonstandard IFPs. Ensure
   the note “ATC RADAR required” is charted on the IFP. See FAA Order 8260.3b,
   paragraph 232 or PAN-Ops Chapter 3.3. for arc OIS dimensions.
   5.1.7. Publish minimum and ATC climb rates in a vertical velocity chart (paragraph
   1.16.7).
   5.1.8. Publish the location of low, close-in obstacles IAW paragraph 5.3.1.
   5.1.9. Computer codes (CIDs). Coordinate all departure procedures that affect the NAS with
   the appropriate FAA ATC facility IAW FAA Order 8260.46. OCONUS MAJCOM TERPS
   functions shall determine whether or not DPs that affect host nation airspace require
   coordination with host nation ATC officials for host nation assigned computer codes.
5.2. RNAV Departure Procedures. Use FAA Order 8260.44, Civil Utilization of Area
Navigation (RNAV) Departure Procedures, and other applicable FAA orders, as specified, when
developing RNAV departure procedures. IAW FAA Order 8260.46, annotate each USAF
RNAV departure procedure with the following 3 notes: “GPS REQUIRED”, “RNAV-1” and
“RADAR REQUIRED FOR NON-GPS EQUIPPED AIRCRAFT”.
 82                                                       AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


   5.2.1. FAA Order 8260.46, Appendix A, paragraph 5.b., Leg Types. The following leg
   types are the only types authorized for AF developed RNAV departure procedures: Direct-
   to-Fix (DF), Course-to-Fix (CF), Track-to-Fix (TF), and Heading-to-an-Altitude (VA).
   5.2.2. FAA Order 8260.44, paragraph 12.3.9; Direct to Fix Leg, Turns more than 120°, Fly-
   Over WP. For all turns greater than 90° at fly-over waypoints, construct the outside turn
   expansion area (Figure 5.1) as follows:
       5.2.2.1. The dimensions of the R2 arcs drawn to form the outside boundaries of the
       turning areas are radii selected from FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, Table 3-2, with the
       appropriate secondary dimension width added.
       5.2.2.2. Join the turn expansion area by tangent to the full basic width abeam the next
       waypoint (DF legs) or by tangent 30° inward towards the departure course to establish
       the primary and secondary areas after the turn (TF legs).

Figure 5.1. Turns Greater Than 90° at a Fly-over Waypoint.




5.3. Supplemented Departure Criteria. Use criteria in this paragraph in conjunction with the
indicated chapters and paragraphs from FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, and FAA Order 8260.46.
Except when applying paragraph 3.11, the departure OCS shall begin at the DER at the DER
elevation.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 83


  5.3.1. FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, Paragraph 1.3.1; Low, Close-in OCS Penetrations.
  Those obstacles identified within the ICA that penetrate a 40:1 OCS and require a CG in
  excess of 200 ft/NM to a climb-to-altitude of 200 feet or less above the DER elevation are
  known as low, close-in obstacles. Do not publish any climb gradient to avoid these
  obstacles. Apply paragraph 1.16.6 when calculating departure climb gradients to avoid
  obstacles that penetrate the 40:1 OCS. Note: When the DOD Option formula is used to
  determine the climb gradient, this formula will be used to determine whether or not the
  obstacle is classified as a “low, close-in” obstacle.
     5.3.1.1. Identify obstacle(s) requiring such a climb gradient by publishing takeoff
     obstacle notes in the IFR Take-Off Minimums and (Obstacle) Departure Procedures
     section of the DOD FLIP (Terminal). Specify obstacle type, location relative to the DER,
     height (AGL), and elevation (MSL). Do not add accuracy values to the reported
     heights/elevations.
     5.3.1.2. Publish takeoff obstacle notes using the following format: “RWY 35, trees
     2,430′ from DER, 50′ right of centerline, 120′ AGL/2,220′ MSL” or “RWY 22L,
     aircraft tail 270′ from DER, 190′ left of centerline, 40′ AGL/1,480′ MSL.” Note:
     When takeoff obstacle notes are published, there is no requirement to list the same
     obstacle(s) on a graphic depiction of a DP.
     5.3.1.3. When the noted takeoff obstacle is terrain, only list the MSL height; do not list
     an AGL height of “0” feet.
         5.3.1.3.1. When multiple terrain points are relatively close together and of similar
         height, group them together in a single entry in the following format: “RWY 04,
         terrain beginning 16′ from DER, 500′ left of centerline, up to 4305′ MSL.”
         5.3.1.3.2. When grouping numerous terrain points is impractical, group together as
         many as possible in the single entry and list the remaining points individually.
     5.3.1.4. See FAA Order 8260.46 for additional sample notes for trees, antennas, and
     buildings.
  5.3.2. FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, Paragraph 1.4.1; Calculating Climb Gradients to Clear
  Obstacles. At host nation locations and all AF OCONUS locations where the AF exercises
  TERPS authority, the Standard formula is not authorized; use the DOD Option formula. The
  note “NOT FOR CIVIL USE” is not required on these procedures. Note: The DOD option
  is not authorized when applying NATO/PANS-OPS Criteria (Chapter 7).
  5.3.3. FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, Paragraph 1.4.2; Calculating the CG Termination
  Altitude. When calculating the climb-to-altitude (CTA), use the un-rounded CG from either
  of the formulas from FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, paragraph 1.4.1.
     5.3.3.1. Document all manual CTA calculations in the procedure package. When the un-
     rounded value falls between two 100-foot increments, the published CTA value shall be
     rounded up to the higher 100-foot increment.
     5.3.3.2. When the controlling obstacle is in the secondary area, calculate the equivalent
     height IAW paragraph A3.11.1. Then calculate the CG and CTA as if the obstacle was
     located in the primary area.

  5.3.4. FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, Paragraph 1.4.3; Climb Gradients to Altitudes for
  Other than Obstacles, i.e., ATC. Distance “D” is measured from DER to the point where the
  altitude is required.
  5.3.5. FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, Paragraph 1.4.4; Multiple Climb Gradients
  Application. This paragraph applies to obstacle driven climb gradients only. When a
  departure utilizes multiple transitions, evaluate each transition separately. Publish the climb
  gradient from DER for each transition requiring a climb gradient greater than 200 ft/NM.
  Note: When an ATC climb rate is required after an obstacle climb rate, it may be established
  beginning at the point where the obstacle climb rate has terminated.
  5.3.6. FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, Paragraph 1.4.5, Limiting Takeoff Runway Available
  (TORA) to Reduce Climb Gradient. Do not apply this criteria.
     5.3.6.1. When required by FAA Order 8260.46, Table 1, and IAW paragraph 5.3.14 of
     this instruction, provide an option to reduce the available takeoff runway length [reduced
     takeoff runway length (RTRL) departure procedure] based on the most penetrating
     obstacle to the 40:1 departure OCS. Note: This option is not authorized when the
     obstacle penetrates the OCS by more than 35 feet.
     5.3.6.2. Where p = the amount of penetration to the 40:1 OCS, calculate the reduced
     takeoff runway length (value n) using the following formula (when publishing the
     reduced takeoff runway length value, round the result upward to the next 100-foot
     increment):
                                     n = 30.38 × (p + 35)

     5.3.6.3. Example: An obstacle is located 12,000 feet from DER. The 40:1 OCS surface
     rise from DER to the obstacle is 300 feet (12,000 ÷ 40 = 300). The obstacle penetrates
     the 40:1 OCS at this point by 23 feet; n = 30.38 × (23 + 35); n = 1762.04 (round up to
     1,800).
     5.3.6.4. Publish a RTRL departure procedure in the IFR Take-off Minimums and
     (Obstacle) Departure Procedures section of the DOD FLIP (Terminal) in the following
     format:
  TAKE-OFF MINIMUMS:

  RWY 13: 500-3, or standard with minimum climb of 230 feet per NM to 5600 feet.
  Alternatively, with standard takeoff minimums and normal 200 feet per NM climb
  gradient, takeoff must occur no later than 1,800 feet prior to departure end of runway.

  5.3.7. FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, Paragraph 1.4.6; Effect of DER-to-Obstacle Distance.
  Do not apply this criteria. Apply the applicable required actions from FAA Order 8260.46,
  Table 1 (paragraph 5.3.14).
  5.3.8. FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, Paragraph 1.6.2a; Length. Ensure the initial climb area
  (ICA) length is sufficient for an aircraft to reach 400 feet above the DER elevation.
     5.3.8.1. A climb gradient in excess of 200 ft/NM may be used to reduce the length of the
     ICA to less than 2 NM. By increasing the CG in the following formula, the length of the
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  85


     ICA can be adjusted as required: c ÷ CG = length of ICA in NM. Note: c = desired turn
     elevation above DER (enter an AGL value; normally 400).
     5.3.8.2. Departures requiring an early turn (turn at an altitude less than 400 feet above
     DER) are nonstandard and require waiver. Publish the note “NOT FOR CIVIL USE”
     on departures when applying this option.
  5.3.9. FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, Paragraph 2.3; DVA EVALUATION (ASR Required).
  Supplemental DVA guidance will be published in AFMAN 13-215, Volume 2.
  5.3.10. FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, Paragraph 3.1; DEAD RECKONING (DR)
  DEPARTURE. When operational necessity dictates, DR segments may extend more than 10
  NM from the DER; however, when applying this option, the DP is nonstandard and requires
  waiver.
     5.3.10.1. When a DR segment extends more than 10 NM from the DER the area
     continues to splay to points abeam the point where positive course guidance (PCG) is
     established or to the end of the departure.
     5.3.10.2. Publish headings (not DR tracks) to be flown. For example: “Climb heading
     220 to 3000 …” or “Climbing left turn direct ABC VOR …”.
  5.3.11. FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, Paragraph 3.5; TURNING SEGMENT
  CONSTRUCTION; 3.5.1. General. The minimum airspeed allowed for Category E aircraft
  shall be 310 KIAS.
  5.3.12. FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, Paragraph 3.8; MULTIPLE TURNS.
     5.3.12.1. A secondary area is authorized on the outside of a turn when the segment after
     the turn is established on a radial towards the NAVAID providing positive course
     guidance for the segment. Construct the secondary area by continuing the outside turn
     expansion area, 30° relative to the departure course, until the expansion joins the primary
     width of the trapezoid to establish point C as illustrated in Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.3.
     This secondary area is defined by the area bound by points A, B and C in Figure 5.2.
     When the termination point is established prior to the facility, the secondary area is
     defined by the area bound by points A, B, D and C in Figure 5.3.

Termination Point is Prior to the Facility.




      5.3.12.2. When multiple turns exist and the width of the first segment on the outside of
      the turn at the end of the first segment is wider than the width of the basic area at that
      point, construct the area on the outside of the turn based upon the width of the area at the
      end of the first segment (not on the width of the basic area at the end of the first
      segment). The start of the outside expansion area is an extension of the boundary of the
      first segment for 1 NM plus fix error (Figure 5.4).

Figure 5.4. Area on the Outside of the Turn When the Width of the Previous Subsegment
is Greater Than the Basic Area Width of the Succeeding Subsegment.




      5.3.12.3. Departure routes containing two successive segments where different facilities
      are providing course guidance may have different segment widths when no turn (or a
      negligible turn) exists where the segments join.
          5.3.12.3.1. Where the preceding segment is wider than the succeeding segment, the
          primary and secondary area boundaries shall taper inward at 30° towards the course
          line until they join the primary and secondary areas (as appropriate) of the succeeding
          segment (Figure 5.5).
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                           89


Figure 5.5. Negligible Turns with Different Facilities; Succeeding Segment Narrower Than
Preceding Segment.




          5.3.12.3.2. Where the preceding segment’s ending width is narrower than the
          succeeding segment’s beginning width, no adjustment is required (Figure 5.6).

Figure 5.6. Negligible Turns with Different Facilities; Preceding Segment Narrower Than
Succeeding Segment.




      5.3.12.4. When a turn is followed by two successive segments using the same facility, it
      is possible for the outside turn expansion to have not completed its inward taper prior to
      the end of the first segment after the turn. In these cases, the line defining the outside
      turn expansion shall be drawn at 30° from the centerline of the succeeding segment until
      it joins the next segment. The leg length of the succeeding segment may require
      adjustment if the extended line does not join the next segment (Figure 5.7). Note: When
      the last sub-segment of a departure procedure contains a turn, it is possible for the outside
      turn expansion to have not completed its inward taper prior to the end of the segment. In
      this case, the length of the last sub-segment must be extended to allow the inward taper of
      the turn expansion to complete. The inward taper of the turn expansion is complete when
      the inward taper intersects the outer boundary of the primary area of the trapezoid
      defining the segment at the final fix.

Figure 5.7. Outer Boundary Turn Expansion Continued to Join the Next Segment.




      5.3.12.5. Turns greater than 90° do not require an inside turn expansion when the
      preceding segment, from centerline to the outer boundary of the secondary area on the
      side of the turn, is fully contained within the basic area of the segment after the turn
      (Figure 5.8).

      5.3.12.6. For turns greater than 90°, the area of the succeeding segment that lies outside
      the centerline of the preceding segment and prior to the turn fix shall not be considered as
      part of the succeeding segment (Figure 5.9).

Figure 5.9. Area Not Considered as Part of the Succeeding Segment.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                     93


      5.3.12.7. For turns greater than 150° following a climb-to-altitude where point A is
      inside the basic area of the facility, a line tangent to the outer boundary radius shall be
      drawn at 30° from the centerline of the succeeding segment to join the succeeding
      segment’s outer boundary. When a tangent does not exist, then point A shall be used
      (Figure 5.10).

Figure 5.10. Construction with Tangent to Outer Boundary Arc.




      5.3.12.8. When a climb-to-altitude followed by a turn direct to facility is constructed, the
      segment’s outer boundary area will be defined as a line from point A to the tangent of the
      outer boundary, point B (Figure 5.11). The taper of this line will not exceed 30° relative
      to the course line. When the 30° maximum is used and the line will not intersect point A
      at the basic area width, expand the width of the basic area at point A to intersect the outer
      boundary line (Figure 5.12).

      be made to a point formed by a line drawn perpendicular to the course 2 NM prior to each
      turn fix at the inside boundary of the primary area, then directly to the obstacle. This
      method shall also be applied to distance measurements for obstacles in succeeding
      segments (Figure 5.13).

   Develop VCOAs in conjunction with an ODP per Table 1, ODP Development Combinations,
   from FAA Order 8260.46. Publish VCOAs in the IFR Take-off Minimums and (Obstacle)
   Departure Procedures section in a textual format only. When ODP development is not
   possible or practical, a stand-alone VCOA is authorized. Use this paragraph to justify the
   GPD generated violation for a stand-alone VCOA. Note: Do not build or publish VCOA
   procedures when ATC management has determined a VCOA is not operationally feasible.
   This determination shall be in writing and a copy shall be maintained in the departure
   procedure package. When ATC has made this determination and a VCOA is not developed,
   GPD will generate a violation indicating the ODP rules have not been satisfied. Justify this
   violation with “ATC has determined a VCOA is not operationally feasible; see
   documentation in procedure package” on the justification tab of the violation dialog of
   GPD. Do not pursue waiver action for this violation.
      5.3.13.1. Paragraph 4 1, BASIC AREA. The radius of the visual climb area (VCA) is

      5.3.13.2. Paragraph 4.2, VCOA EVALUATION.
         5.3.13.2.1. VCOA diverse areas are evaluated to 25 NM for non-mountainous areas
         and to 46 NM for designated mountainous areas.
         5.3.13.2.2. For basic areas that exceed the lateral limits of the VCA, the level surface
         is extended from the points of tangency on both sides of the VCA with lines drawn
         perpendicular to the route (lines 1 and 2 of Figure 5.14) and bounded by the side of
         the basic route outside of the VCA (shaded area of Figure 5.14).

      the applicable runway number and the phrase “for climb in visual conditions.” Note:
      Publish low, close-in obstacles IAW paragraph 5.1.8; other obstacles identified in the
      VCOA evaluation are not published.
         5.3.13.3.1. The fix/location specified to cross shall be the airport name for a VCOA
         diverse.
         5.3.13.3.2. The fix/location specified for a VCOA route shall be the start fix used to
         develop the procedure. Publish the airport name when the start fix is the airport.
         When a fix is utilized, publish the 5-letter name of the fix.
         5.3.13.3.3. Publish the radius of the VCA as a distance to remain within during the
         climb in visual conditions. VCA radii greater than 2 NM but less than 3 NM shall be

        be rounded downward to the next whole NM increment.
        5.3.13.3.4. Ensure each VCOA includes the instruction to advise ATC prior to
        execution. The following format is required: “RWY 9; Obtain ATC approval for
        VCOA when requesting IFR clearance. Climb in visual conditions to cross
        McAllen airport at or above 6000 before proceeding on course. Remain within
        4.0 NM of McAllen airport during climb in visual conditions.”
     5.3.13.4. Paragraph 4 3, CEILING AND VISIBILITY. The published ceiling and
     visibility associated with the VCOA procedure shall be followed by, “for climb in visual
     conditions.” Example: “4400-3 for climb in visual conditions.”
  5.3.14. FAA Order 8260.46, Paragraph 2-1. DEPARTURE PROCEDURE GUIDELINES,
  b. Obstacle DPs, Table 1, ODP Development Combinations. The results of diverse
  departure obstacle assessments shall be classified as one of nine ODP cases. Required
  actions based on each ODP case may be a single action or a combination of actions from
  Table 1. Note: Each ODP combination defined in paragraph 5.3.14.6 constitutes one ODP.
     5.3.14.1. Obstacle Departure Procedure (ODP) – a single action or a combination of
     actions developed to assist departing aircraft avoid obstacles that penetrate a 40:1 OCS.
     Only one ODP will be developed and published for each runway.
     5.3.14.2. Standard Instrument Departure (SID) – a departure procedure that is developed
     when requested by ATC. It must include a route, provide the required obstruction
     clearance and shall be published graphically. Multiple SIDs may be developed and
     published for each runway.
     5.3.14.3. ICA3 – a line 3 statute miles (SM) from the ICAB line (DER), perpendicular to
     the runway centerline extended.
     5.3.14.4. ICA (extended) – that area between the ICAB line and the ICA3 line. The ICA
     (extended) origin width is 1,000 feet (± 500 perpendicular to runway centerline) wide at
     the DER and splays outward at a rate of 15° relative to the runway centerline extended
     (Figure 5.15). The ICA (extended) shall only be used to determine which one of the nine
     ODP cases (paragraph 5.3.14.6) apply.
     5.3.14.5. Reduced Takeoff Runway Length (RTRL) departure procedure – A departure
     procedure option that limits the available takeoff runway length so that an obstacle that
     penetrates the 40:1 OCS by 35 feet or less can be cleared vertically by a departing aircraft
     at the standard climb gradient (200 ft/NM) (paragraph 5.3.6).

      5.3.14.6. Departure Procedure Workflow. Complete a diverse departure obstacle
      assessment for each runway authorized for IFR operations. Coordinate diverse departure
      assessment results through the IFR facility manager. Classify the results of the diverse
      departure obstacle assessment into one of the nine ODP cases defined in paragraphs
      5.3.14.6.1 through 5.3.14.6.9. Note: Compare calculated climb gradient (CG) values
      when making this determination in Cases 6, 7, 8, and 9. When the CG values inside and
      outside the ICA (extended) are identical, the CG outside the ICA (extended) shall be
      considered the highest CG and Cases 6 and 7 will not apply.
          5.3.14.6.1. ODP Case 1 – No 40:1 OCS penetrations exist.
             5.3.14.6.1.1. Do not develop or publish an ODP. Do not publish the Delta T ( T )
             symbol on any approach or departure procedure at that location. Note: A SID
             may be developed when required.
             5.3.14.6.1.2. Document the diverse departure obstacle assessment results in a
             procedure package using the AF IMT 4342 and ensure it is accounted for on the
             AFFSA Annual Procedure Inventory as a diverse departure obstacle assessment.
          5.3.14.6.2. ODP Case 2 – 40:1 OCS penetrations exist only within the ICA
          (extended) and all penetrations require a Climb to Altitude (CTA) of 200 feet or less
          above the DER; all penetrations are low, close-in obstacles.
             5.3.14.6.2.1. Only develop and publish low, close-in obstacle notes (paragraph
             5.1.8).
             5.3.14.6.2.2. Send the GPD publication report containing the location of the low,
             close-in obstacles to flight inspection; no drawing is required.
          5.3.14.6.3. ODP Case 3 – 40:1 OCS penetrations exist only within the ICA
          (extended) and all penetrations require a CTA greater than 200 feet above the DER;

      no low, close-in obstacles. Develop and publish only one of the following ODP
      combinations:
         5.3.14.6.3.1. Combination 1: A textual or graphic route or sector that avoids all
         40:1 obstacle penetrations and does not require a climb gradient in excess of 200
         ft/NM.
         5.3.14.6.3.2. Combination 2:
            5.3.14.6.3.2.1. A ceiling and visibility to avoid the penetrations and
            5.3.14.6.3.2.2. Standard minimums with a climb gradient to a fix or altitude
            that provides appropriate obstacle clearance beyond the fix or altitude so that a
            standard climb gradient (200 ft/NM) can be used beyond the fix or altitude
            and
            5.3.14.6.3.2.3. A note identifying the location and height of the controlling
            obstacle and
            5.3.14.6.3.2.4. A reduced takeoff runway length (RTRL) departure procedure
            (except do not apply RTRL when any obstruction penetrates the 40:1 OCS by
            more than 35 feet).
         5.3.14.6.3.3. Combination 3:
            5.3.14.6.3.3.1. A textual or graphic route or sector that avoids some 40:1 OCS
            penetrations laterally and uses a climb gradient to mitigate all other 40:1 OCS
            penetrations vertically. The climb gradient shall provide appropriate obstacle

              INSTRUMENT APPROACH AND ARRIVAL PROCEDURES

Section 6A—Supplemented Approach and Arrival Procedure Development Guidance

6.1. Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR). When a requirement for a STAR exists that can’t be
met by the FAA, develop STARs only when feeder routes and initial approach segments will not
suffice. Use the criteria in FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1, Chapter 17, and the guidance in FAA
Order 7100.9, Standard Terminal Arrival Program and Procedures, when developing a STAR.
Use FAA Form 7100-4, STAR-Standard Terminal Arrival, for documenting and processing the
procedure. Instructions for completing STAR documentation can be found in FAA Order
7100.9.
6.2. Self-Contained Approach (SCA) Criteria. SCAs are special use procedures (paragraph
2.11) used only by aircraft with MAJCOM-approved airborne systems. MAJCOM flying
operation authorities are required to determine whether specific airborne equipment supports the
ability to perform SCAs. Flight inspection is not required; however, a live flyability check
(paragraph 4.1) is required prior to use in IMC. MAJCOM Stan/Eval approval is required prior
to use and publication. SCAs shall be published in a graphic format (planview and profile). At a
minimum, develop an intermediate, final, and missed approach segment IAW FAA Order 8260.3
for each SCA as follows:
   6.2.1. Initial Approach Segment (as required). Apply FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1,
   paragraphs 230, 231, 232, and 235 except the angle of intersection between the initial
   approach course and the intermediate approach course may not exceed 90°.
       6.2.1.1. A satisfactory terminal area fix (FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1, Chapter 2,
       Section 8) may be used in addition to the SCA fix at the initial approach fix (IAF) to
       facilitate use of enroute navigation systems up to the IAF.
       6.2.1.2. Ensure altitudes in the initial segment are not established any lower than the
       MVA (with ATC RADAR) or below the MSA (without ATC RADAR).
   6.2.2. Intermediate Approach Segment. Apply FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1, paragraphs
   240, 241, and 242. When an initial approach segment is not developed, altitudes in the
   intermediate segment shall not be below the MVA (with ATC RADAR) or below the MSA
   (without ATC RADAR).
   6.2.3. Final Approach Segment. Comply with FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1, Section 5,
   Final Approach, except:
       6.2.3.1. Alignment. The final approach course shall be aligned to the extended runway
       centerline.
       6.2.3.2. Area. The area considered for obstacle clearance begins at the final approach fix
       (FAF), ends at the runway threshold, and is centered on the final approach course. The
       minimum length is 6 NM and maximum length is 10 NM.
           6.2.3.2.1. The primary area width at the runway threshold is 1.7 NM each side of the
           runway centerline.
106                                                        AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


         6.2.3.2.2. The primary area expands uniformly to 4 NM each side of the extended
         runway centerline (8 NM total width) 10 NM from the runway threshold.
         6.2.3.2.3. The secondary areas are zero miles wide at the runway threshold and
         expand uniformly to 1 NM at 10 NM from the runway threshold.
      6.2.3.3. Obstacle Clearance. The minimum ROC in the primary area is 300 feet. In the
      secondary area, 300 feet of obstacle clearance must be provided at the inner edge,
      tapering uniformly to zero at the outer edge.
      6.2.3.4. Descent Gradient (DG). Apply FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1, paragraph 252, as
      supplemented by paragraph A3.24.
  6.2.4. Circling Approach. Apply FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1, Chapter 2, Section 6.
  6.2.5. Missed Approach Segment. Apply FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1, Chapter 2, Section
  7.
      6.2.5.1. The missed approach point is on the final approach course at the point where the
      aircraft has reached a specific distance from the runway threshold. It must not be farther
      from the FAF than the first usable portion of the landing surface.
      6.2.5.2. Whenever possible, develop a missed approach that is not based exclusively
      upon the airborne equipment.
  6.2.6. Landing Minima. Apply FAA Order 8260.3.
  6.2.7. Develop single sector (360°) MSAs unless an operational requirement exists.
  Multiple sector MSAs must be coordinated with the requesting agency prior to
  implementation to ensure the users can identify multiple sectors
  6.2.8. Satisfactory Fixes. All fixes must be defined by use of the airborne equipment.
  RNAV waypoints shall be depicted for all segments, but they shall not be used as a primary
  means of navigation.
      6.2.8.1. Fix error for all SCA fixes is plus or minus 0.5 NM.
      6.2.8.2. Annotate all named turn points and fixes associated with an SCA as RNAV
      waypoints (paragraph 1.9). Request NGA add each RNAV waypoint to DAFIF in the
      TAS letter. Note: RNAV waypoints must be included on an SCA procedure to assist
      aircrews in maintaining situational awareness.
      6.2.8.3. Document waypoints associated with the published SCA IWA FAA Order
      8260.19 and this instruction on the FAA Form 8260-2.
  6.2.9. When using GPD to develop SCAs, select “ARA” under approach type. This will be
  modified in a future version of GPD.
      6.2.9.1. Apply paragraph 8.2.1.8 when utilizing GPD to develop holding.
      6.2.9.2. An initial segment must be developed prior to developing the holding pattern
      when utilizing GPD.
  6.2.10. Apply Figure 6.2 when publishing recommended altitudes on final.
  6.2.11. Publication. MAJCOM TERPS authority must contact MAJCOM Stan Eval to
  obtain a list of specific aircraft airborne equipment required to support the SCA approach.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 107


   Ensure these requirements are clearly annotated on the published plate (Example note: “FOR
   USE BY AIRCRAFT EQUIPPED WITH AIRBORNE RADAR”).
   6.2.12. The MAJCOM flying authority shall determine the required equipment notation to
   publish on the approach plate.
6.3. Area Navigation (RNAV). The FAA has replaced Order 8260.38, Civil Utilization of
Global Positioning System (GPS), Order 8260.48, Area Navigation (RNAV) Approach
Construction Criteria, and Order 8260.51, United States Standard for Required Navigation
Performance (RNP) Instrument Approach Procedure Construction, with updated RNAV
guidance in FAA Order 8260.58, United States Standard for Performance Based navigation
(PBN) Instrumrnt Procedure Design. All RNAV instrument procedures based on criteria in
these cancelled FAA orders remain valid. The USAF will continue use of RNAV criteria
guidance in these cancelled FAA orders (as amended in this AFI) in GPD until GPD is replaced
by the next generation automation tool. Digital copies of these cancelled orders are available
from                   the                  FAA                    web                    site:
http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/document.list.
MAJCOMs may, at their discretion, publish the note “NOT FOR CIVIL USE” on any of their
RNAV procedures developed with the cancelled FAA orders. Note: Do not develop Localizer
Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV) procedures and do not develop approach type
“RNAV Precision” using GPD until specific authorization is given by HQ AFFSA/A3A.
   6.3.1. RNAV (ground-based systems, e.g., VOR/DME). Do not develop RNAV procedures
   based on ground-based systems. Do not apply any criteria from FAA Order 8260.3, Volume
   1, Chapter 15.
   6.3.2. RNAV [satellite-based systems, e.g., global positioning system (GPS)].
       6.3.2.1. Develop nonprecision (stand-alone) lateral navigation (LNAV) IAW FAA Order
       8260.38, and terminal arrival areas (TAA) IAW FAA Order 8260.45, Terminal Arrival
       Area (TAA) Design Criteria). Intermediate segment lengths for stand-alone LNAV
       procedures will be determined IAW FAA Order 8260.3, Volume I, paragraph 242.b.(1)
       and Table 3. Use GPD to develop all supported procedure segments. Note: GPD builds
       the following missed approach types; straight to fix, turn to fix and a climb to altitude
       missed approach to which holding can be added.
       6.3.2.2. The AF takes exception to FAA Order 8260.38, paragraphs 11a and 12a. For
       AF procedures, course changes at the intermediate waypoint (IWP) shall not exceed 90°.
       Course changes at the final approach waypoint (FAWP) shall not exceed 15°. Note: The
       waypoints indicating the Intermediate Fix (IF) and the Final Approach Fix (FAF) shall be
       charted IAW DOD publication specifications.
       6.3.2.3. The AF takes exception to FAA Order 8260.38, paragraph 14, MISSED
       APPROACH SEGMENT. Except as stated in this AFI, use the criteria in paragraph 14
       in conjunction with FAA Order 8260.48. Rescind the “Route” portion of missed
       approach contained within FAA Order 8260.38. Utilize a “Direct” turning missed
       approach developed IAW FAA Order 8260.38 with the following restrictions:
          6.3.2.3.1. The turn must commence at the MAP (i.e., the combination straight and
          turning missed approach is not authorized).
108                                                        AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


         6.3.2.3.2. The missed approach procedure is limited to one turn.
      6.3.2.4. The AF takes exception to FAA Order 8260.38, paragraph 16, STRAIGHT
      MISSED APPROACH. Straight missed approach criteria are applied when the missed
      approach course does not differ more than 15° from the final approach course.
      Secondary areas are not permitted within the ICA.
      6.3.2.5. The AF takes exception to FAA Order 8260.38, paragraph 17, TURNING
      MISSED APPROACH. Turning missed approach criteria apply whenever the missed
      approach course differs by more than 15° from the final approach course. Establish a fly-
      by (FB) or a fly-over (FO) turning waypoint (TWP) to identify the point at which the turn
      commences, followed by a TF leg segment. Construct the ICA of a turning missed
      approach in the same manner as straight missed approach and shall be a continuation of
      the final approach course (±15°).
      6.3.2.6. When developing LNAV/VNAV procedures, use the LNAV VNAV TEMP
      Spreadsheet (available on the HQ AFFSA Airfield Operations website at
      https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/AFFSA/A3A/SitePages/Home.aspx) to calculate the lowest
      usable temperature for entry into the Summary Tab of the Approach Procedures dialog
      window.
      6.3.2.7. The USAF does not conduct DME/DME screening modeling to determine the
      adequacy of DME signal reception to support RNAV instrument approach procedures.
      Therefore, a chart note is required to indicate a DME/DME solution is not authorized.
      Ensure all current and future USAF RNAV instrument approach procedures have the
      following note charted: DME/DME RNP – 0.3 NA.
      6.3.2.8. When designing RNAV procedures, use Table 6.1 to determine whether the
      waypoint is to be designed as a Fly-by (FB) waypoint or as a Fly-over (FO) waypoint.
      EXCEPTION: The IAWP may be designed as a FO waypoint only when preceded by a
      feeder route. Applying this exception will result in a GPD violation; use this paragraph
      as justification for the violation. Note: All stepdown fixes are along track distances and
      are charted as FB fixes in the planview.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                    109


Table 6.1. Waypoint Design Standard (see Note).




       6.3.2.9. Apply FAA Order 8260.19, paragraph 8-56.d.(9) to AF developed RNAV
       missed approach instructions.
       6.3.2.10. When publishing LNAV minima in conjunction with LNAV/VNAV minima,
       identify the location of the VDP by the NM distance to the threshold. Indicate the VDP
       as applicable to the LNAV only and ensure “LNAV only” is published on the approach
       plate. Note: When required due to space limitations in the profile view, NGA will
       identify the procedure to which the VDP applies with an asterisk (*) or other symbol.
6.4. Point in Space (PINS) Procedures. Establish a minimum descent altitude (MDA) or
decision altitude (DA) of 500 feet or higher above ground level (AGL) for procedures that do not
provide for landing. Except for helicopter point in space procedures, these are special use
instrument procedures and require annotation per paragraph 2.11. Additionally, apply
paragraph 1.13 Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Procedures, to PINS procedures when all appropriate
instrument procedure criteria has not been applied. Calculate recommended altitudes manually
IAW paragraph 6.8.2 except use the FAF to missed approach point (MAP) distance and the
MDA.
6.5. Publishing ILS Restrictions. Permanent, flight inspected restrictions to ILS facilities, as
documented in the flight inspection report, shall be published in the planview of DOD FLIP
(Terminal) as a caution note(s) and as requested by flight inspection. Inform all other signatories
on the procedure of these restrictions. Examples: “CAUTION: ILS GS unusable below 3100
MSL”, or “CAUTION: Autopilot coupled operations NA past DA.” Process any new
restrictions from the flight inspection as procedural changes.
 110                                                        AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


6.6. Publishing More than One Instrument Procedure on a Single Chart in the DOD FLIP
(Terminal). Combining non-RNAV instrument approach procedures for publication on a single
chart is accomplished as a cartographic function by NGA during their publication process and
shall be limited to the conditions of this paragraph. When excessive chart clutter results, de-
combine and publish the two IFPs separately.
   6.6.1. VOR/DME and VOR procedures and VOR/DME and TACAN procedures predicated
   on VORTAC facilities may be combined by NGA for publishing on a single chart. Ensure
   the following when sending the IFPs referred to in this paragraph to NGA for publication on
   a single chart:
       6.6.1.1. Each IFP must be developed as a stand-alone procedure;
       6.6.1.2. Each IFP must be sent to flight inspection as a stand-alone procedure;
       6.6.1.3. The published final and missed approach courses are identical;
          6.6.1.3.1. The FAF location and altitude, any stepdown fix(es) and altitude(s), and
          the VDPs must be identical.
          6.6.1.3.2. Missed approach instructions must be identical.
       6.6.1.4. Include instructions for NGA to combine the procedures on a single chart.
   6.6.2. ILS and localizer procedures may be developed in GPD as a combined instrument
   procedure prior to flight inspection and publishing. Ensure the localizer box is checked so
   that both the localizer and the ILS are built in GPD simultaneously.
       6.6.2.1. A single package with both procedures documented is sent to flight inspection
       and then to NGA for publication.
       6.6.2.2. Whenever a VDP is published for the localizer procedure on any ILS procedure,
       indicate the VDP is for localizer use only by ensuring “LOC only” is published on the
       approach plate. Note: When required due to space limitations in the profile view, NGA
       will identify the procedure to which the VDP applies with an asterisk (*) or other symbol.
   6.6.3. Apply FAA Order 8260.19, paragraph 8-52.d.(1) to AF developed ILS and MLS
   instrument procedures published with non-vertically guided procedures (localizer or azimuth)
   that are published on the same approach chart and require a stepdown fix in the final
   segment. Also apply this guidance to RNAV (GPS) charts without vertical guidance that
   contain LNAV/VNAV minima when the stepdown fix restriction applies only to the LNAV
   line of minima.
       6.6.3.1. Fix altitudes published on the profile view of an ILS, RNAV, or MLS procedure
       between the FAF/PFAF and the runway threshold, i.e., stepdown fixes, are to be applied
       to the non-vertically guided (localizer, LNAV, or azimuth) procedure only. Note: For
       RNAV stepdown fixes published in conjunction with vertically-guided minimums, the
       published altitude at the fix must be equal to or less than the computed glidepath altitude
       at the fix.
       6.6.3.2. Ensure the following is applied to all applicable ILS, RNAV, and MLS
       procedures: annotate the stepdown fix altitude with “LOC only”, “LNAV Only”, or
       “AZ only”, as applicable, in the profile view.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 111


6.7. Sidestep Maneuver (SSM) Procedures. Apply FAA Order 8260.19, paragraph 4-6, and
this paragraph. A SSM is a procedure where the final approach is aligned to one runway
(referred to as the approach runway), and a visual maneuver is made to land on a parallel runway
(referred to as the sidestep runway). A SSM to an adjacent runway that is not parallel to the
approach runway is nonstandard and requires waiver. Publish SSM procedures only under the
following conditions:
   6.7.1. Depict only one final approach course (to the approach runway) on the planview.
   6.7.2. The same nonprecision final approach area (appropriate to the final approach
   guidance) is evaluated for both the approach and sidestep runways. When publishing SSM
   minima in conjunction with an ILS approach, use a localizer final approach trapezoid to
   establish the SSM MDA.
       6.7.2.1. When designing the sidestep runway final approach area in GPD, place an
       appropriate pseudo NAVAID abeam the approach runway NAVAID and on the sidestep
       runway centerline (or when applicable, the sidestep runway extended runway centerline).
       6.7.2.2. The appropriate final approach area of the sidestep runway must be aligned with
       the sidestep runway centerline extended; orientation of the sidestep runway final
       approach area trapezoid shall match the orientation of the approach runway final
       approach area trapezoid for both on-airport and off-airport facilities.
       6.7.2.3. Establish the sidestep runway FAF on the sidestep runway centerline extended
       abeam the approach runway FAF. The area considered for obstacle clearance in the
       sidestep final starts at the sidestep runway FAF and continues towards the sidestep
       runway threshold.
       6.7.2.4. Establish a VDP to determine the length of the visual portion of the final
       approach segment on the sidestep runway. Note: Do not publish a VDP for the sidestep
       runway.
       6.7.2.5. The same nonprecision obstacle clearance used for the approach runway shall be
       used to determine the nonprecision MDA for the sidestep runway. The published
       sidestep MDA shall be equal to or higher than the MDA for the approach runway.
   6.7.3. Calculate visibility minima as follows:
       6.7.3.1. Use the sidestep HATh when calculating visibility values. The sidestep runway
       MDA minus sidestep runway threshold elevation equals the sidestep runway HATh.
       6.7.3.2. When the distance between the approach runway FAF and sidestep runway
       threshold is less than the minimum no-light visibility for a particular aircraft approach
       category, do not authorize a SSM for that approach category. Note: Application of this
       restriction will provide sufficient visibility to acquire and maneuver to the sidestep
       runway.
   6.7.4. When the descent gradient exceeds 400 ft/NM to either the approach runway or to the
   sidestep runway, the SSM is nonstandard and requires waiver. Apply FAA Order 8260.3,
   paragraph 252 to the sidestep runway except the gradient is based on:
       6.7.4.1. The distance from the approach runway FAF (or last stepdown fix) to the
       sidestep runway threshold
 112                                                        AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


         6.7.4.2. The height difference between the minimum altitude at the approach runway
         FAF (or last stepdown fix) and the threshold elevation of the sidestep runway
   6.7.5. Minima are published as shown in the sample in Figure 6.1. Assuming runways 27L
   and 27R, with an ILS approach published to runway 27L, identify the procedure as ILS or
   LOC RWY 27L.

Figure 6.1. Sample Sidestep Minima (with credit for lights) Publication and Associated
‘ALS inop’.




   6.7.6. Develop and submit only one procedure package to flight inspection (with one
   signature page) that includes the publication report for the sidestep maneuver procedure.
   Justify segment violations, other than final approach segment, with the following notation:
   “NA; SSM.”
Notes:

   1. Flight inspection will treat the SSM like another set of minima and a ground track to
   check as a part of the normal instrument procedure.

   2. Additional coordination of this procedure shall be IAW Chapter 2.

   3. The AF IMT 4343 date-time stamp will not match the date-time stamp of the sidestep
   procedure build.

6.8. Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) Approach Procedures. Apply FAA Order 8260.3,
Volume 1, paragraph 252 when determining the appropriate ASR approach descent gradient
(DG) and FAF altitude. Do not publish TCH, descent angle, or descent gradient for ASR
approach procedures.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                             113


  6.8.1. At Radar Final Control (RFC) locations without ASR scope availability, surveillance
  approaches using PAR azimuth may be developed using localizer criteria (FAA Order
  8260.3, Volume 1, Chapter 9). This will permit use of GPD for procedure development.
  Recommended altitudes must be computed manually.
     6.8.1.1. The FAF and final approach segment length are defined as a distance from the
     PAR touchdown point (or RPI).
     6.8.1.2. Use the FAF to threshold distance and the TCH (MSL value) when calculating
     the recommended altitudes for straight-in approaches. When there is no VGSI for the
     runway, select an appropriate TCH from FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 3, Table 2-3.
  6.8.2. Establish recommended altitudes for each mile on final between the FAF and the
  MAP, but not below the MDA. Round each recommended altitude to the nearest 20-foot
  increment. When requested or required by host nation authorities, round each recommended
  altitude to the nearest 100-foot increment. Given the following conditions: FAF 7.8 miles
  from threshold; minimum altitude at FAF is 9000; minimum altitude at 3 mile stepdown fix
  is 7300; TCH Elevation (MSL) is 6172; and MDA is 6580, use Figure 6.2 as an example for
  calculating the recommended altitudes. Note: Recommended altitudes are bolded.
 114                                                        AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013

6.9. Best Fit Straight Line (BFSL) Application to Threshold Crossing Height (TCH). Do
not use flight inspection derived BFSL RDH data in IFP development.
6.10. Category I Microwave Landing System (MLS). Develop MLS and Mobile Microwave
Landing System (MMLS) procedures using criteria in paragraph 6.11 and the criteria in FAA
Order 8260.3, Volume 3.
6.11. Mobile Microwave Landing System (MMLS). The minimum glide slope angle is 3.00°,
and maximum authorized glide slope angle is 3.60°. Angles beyond these paramiters are
nonstandard and require waiver.
   6.11.1. System Components. The system components are considered to be the MMLS
   Azimuth, Elevation, and DME. An additional conventional NAVAID may be used to
   conduct the instrument procedure i.e., missed approach or initial segment; however it will not
   be considered a system component. The MMLS does not provide back course azimuth.
   Course guidance used beyond the MAP shall be based on another source. Note: The three
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   115


  letter DME source shall not be identical to any other on field NAVAIDS, e.g., local TACAN
  is “RMS”; do not use “RMS” as the MLS identification.
  6.11.2. The following definitions apply:
     6.11.2.1. MMLS Datum Point. A point on runway centerline, 90° abeam the MMLS
     elevation station (same as runway crown point for ILS procedures).
     6.11.2.2. Elevation Antenna Emplacement Point.
         6.11.2.2.1. Assault strip. Elevation station located approximately 156 feet either side
         of centerline for a collocated site (up to 450 feet for a split-site configuration).
         6.11.2.2.2. All other landing areas. Elevation station located approximately 250 to
         306 feet either side of centerline for a collocated site (up to 450 feet for a split-site
         configuration).
     6.11.2.3. Service Limitation. The azimuth service limitation is 15 miles from the
     facility, within ± 40° of the center course (Figure 6.3). The elevation service limitation is
     15 miles from the facility and from 2.5° to 15°.
     6.11.2.4. Minimum Azimuth Coverage. See FAA Order 8200.1, Chapter 16, Section
     220 for minimum azimuth coverage requirements.
  6.11.3. MMLS Approach Minimums.
     6.11.3.1. MMLS Category I is defined as a precision approach (PA) procedure with a
     DA of not less than 200 feet above runway threshold.
     6.11.3.2. ‘Azimuth Only’ are approach procedures that do not use the elevation
     components of the MMLS. When calculating azimuth only minima, apply FAA Order
     8260.3, Volume 1, Chapter 9.
         6.11.3.2.1. When automating the azimuth only portion in GPD, create a false runway
         at the airport that matches the current runway that the MMLS approach is being
         designed to. For example, create RWY 05L since RWY 05 already exists.
         6.11.3.2.2. Then create an MMLS in split site configuration (create a false localizer)
         for the false runway. Once this false runway and MMLS have been created, an
         azimuth only procedure can be designed. GPD only allows one localizer per runway;
         there is no other way to automate the procedure without the false localizer.
         6.11.3.2.3. The azimuth procedure can then be used in conjunction with the precision
         portion of the MMLS approach giving precision, nonprecision and circling minima on
         the same approach plate.
     6.11.3.3. When calculating circling minima, apply FAA Order 8260.3.
     6.11.3.4. Computed MMLS. A collocated azimuth and elevation antenna site that
     provides guidance along the extended runway centerline to account for offset installation
     of the azimuth antenna. MMLS DME information is derived from an antenna located on
     top of the azimuth antenna. Use of external DME source (TACAN or VOR/DME) is not
     authorized except as noted in paragraph 6.11.5. Computed MMLS requires special
     aircraft avionics and may not support normal civil operations.
116                                                        AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


  6.11.4. Fixes. All fixes established within the MMLS coverage area shall be based on
  MMLS DME. Additionally, the following criteria applies:
      6.11.4.1. MMLS DME fix error is 0.5 miles.
      6.11.4.2. Published MMLS fix distances shall be specified to the nearest tenth of a mile.
      6.11.4.3. Establish the PFAF by MMLS DME and publish the distance from the DME
      antenna.
  6.11.5. Inoperative System Components.
      6.11.5.1. At collocated sites, a failure of any component (azimuth, elevation, or DME)
      will render the procedure unusable. Failure of one antenna will result in aircraft receiver
      course and glide slope off or warning flags and loss of course information.
      6.11.5.2. DME Failure. For split-site locations, when the MMLS DME transmitter is
      inoperative, another means may be employed to determine position along the approach
      course such as DME from a TACAN or VOR/DME. Note: When this option is
      exercised, ensure the appropriate obstacle search areas are evaluated (different fix error
      involved in identifying a PFAF from another NAVAID or via radar).
  6.11.6. On assault landing strips or zones, the MMLS will be sited to provide touchdown
  300 to 500 feet from threshold. Because of this limitation, the TCH and WCH may be less
  than normally authorized for a specific aircraft height group. When developing MMLS
  procedures supporting landing strips or landing zones, the minimum TCH is 30 feet
  regardless of aircraft height group. A TCH of less than 30 feet or greater than 60 feet is
  nonstandard and requires waiver processing. WCH violations do not require waiver action.
  These procedures are classified special use. Apply notation requirements IAW paragraphs
  2.11 and A3.43. Note: approach minima below circling may be restricted. Updated
  guidance (AF Engineering Technical Letter 09-6) may be obtained from the AFCEC
  publications         manager         at         Tyndall         AFB,        FL        via
  http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/browse_cat.php?=125.
  6.11.7. Threshold Crossing Height (TCH).        TCH will vary based on deployment
  configuration and system siting requirements. The optimum threshold crossing height is 50
  but VGSI coincidence should be a primary consideration. Except as specified in paragraph
  6.11.6, FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 3, paragraph 2.6 and Table 2-3 applies.
  6.11.8. Procedure Design Limitations.        Development of MMLS procedures shall be
  independent of existing procedures.
      6.11.8.1. Only straight-in procedures are authorized; curved or angled procedures are not
      permitted.
      6.11.8.2. The intermediate segment azimuth shall be a straight extension of the final
      approach course.
  6.11.9. Missed Approach. Do not use MMLS for missed approach course guidance. MMLS
  DME can be used in the missed approach segment not to exceed the service volume.
  Annotate the procedure IAW paragraph A3.10 when radar is used for the missed approach.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                           117

                                NATO/PANS-OPS CRITERIA

7.1. Implementation Requirements. When directed by the host nation, and only after the
MAJCOM TERPS staff has determined a sufficient number of personnel are trained in ICAO
PANS-OPS standards and design methods, implement NATO/PANS-OPS criteria (paragraph
7.2.2) at all OCONUS locations where the host nation operates the airfield and the AF has
instrument procedure responsibility. At US operated locations OCONUS, do not implement this
criteria (i.e., continue using US TERPS criteria) until it is determined by AF airfield authorities
that the airfield meets ICAO Annex 14 airfield design criteria or that the airfield design can
support ICAO PANS-OPS instrument procedure design.
7.2. Definitions.
   7.2.1. ICAO PANS-OPS. References to ICAO PANS-OPS apply to the standards defined in
   ICAO Document 8168-OPS/611, Procedures for Air Navigation Services – Aircraft
   Operations (PANS-OPS) Volume II, Construction of Visual and Instrument Flight
   Procedures. This criteria is applied when selecting the “ICAO” button in GPD.
   7.2.2. NATO/PANS-OPS. Allied Air Traffic Control Publication-1 (AATCP-1) is the
   NATO supplement to ICAO Document 8168-OPS/611, Volume II. NATO/PANS-OPS
   refers to the instrument procedure criteria in AATCP-1 and includes instrument procedure
   criteria applicable to military aircraft. This criteria is applied when selecting the “NATO”
   button in GPD.
7.3. Application. Mixing US TERPS and any other criteria at the same location is only
authorized when GPD software does not have the capability to develop an IFP type using
NATO/PANS-OPS criteria. Inform the host nation when using US TERPS criteria at locations
where the host nation operates the airfield and the AF has instrument procedure responsibility.
   7.3.1. When a waiver is required due to criteria deviations, specify in the waiver request the
   applicable document and paragraph to be waived. Examples: “PANS-OPS, Volume II, Part
   III, paragraph 5.6”, or “AATCP-1, paragraph 414.d.1,” etc.
   7.3.2. When a specific requirement exists for a type of instrument procedure that is not
   addressed in this chapter, AATCP-1, or in ICAO PANS-OPS, use FAA Order 8260.3 as
   supplemented by AFI 11-230.
   7.3.3. Except when limited by GPD (paragraph 7.3), apply a single criteria or standard to
   all IFPs at a single location. Ensure that procedure packages, the Attachment 6 checklist, and
   FTIP review letters clearly identify which standard has been applied. Consider the following
   when determining which standard to apply:
       7.3.3.1. Is the host nation using standard ICAO PANS-OPS, or some variation consistent
       with the ICAO philosophy?
       7.3.3.2. Has the AF instrument procedure designer responsible for the location been
       formally trained in ICAO instrument procedure design methods?
       7.3.3.3. Does GPD support the type of procedure(s) to be reviewed or designed?

        degree.
        7.3.4.2.2. Paragraphs 205, 206 and 211 are not applicable. The AF has not
        established requirements for helicopter procedures IAW ICAO standards. Paragraph
        204.a.1. – publish descent angles to the nearest one-tenth of a degree.
        7.3.4.2.3. Paragraph 209. Not applicable, except for 209.a.
        7.3.4.2.4. Paragraph 239. Not applicable.
     7.3.4.3. Chapter 3. Additional Military Criteria – Takeoff and Landing Minima.
        7.3.4.3.1. When a stepdown fix is included in the final segment, minimums with, and
        without the stepdown fix shall be provided unless DME is required to fly the final
        segment.
        7.3.4.3.2. Paragraph 318, Safe Altitude 100 NM. The Safe Altitude 100 NM shall be
        charted IAW DOD publication specifications for Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA).
        The Safe Altitude 100 NM center point for an RNAV approach shall be the Missed
        Approach Waypoint (MAWP).

     the remaining segments associated with PAR procedures, use ICAO PANS-OPS or
     AATCP-1.
     7.3.4.6. Chapter 8. Additional Military Criteria – Helicopters. Not applicable. The AF
     has not established requirements for helicopter procedures IAW ICAO standards.
     7.3.4.7. Chapter 9. Additional Military Criteria – Departures. Paragraph 901.d. Apply
     VCOA wording from paragraph 5.3.13.3.4.
  7.3.5. Use of ICAO PANS-OPS. The following items supplement ICAO PANS-OPS:
     7.3.5.1. Part I. General.
        7.3.5.1.1. Section 2, Chapter 1, paragraph 1.7, Increased Altitudes/Heights for
        Mountainous Terrain. In addition, add 600 meters (or 2000 feet when non-SI units
        (feet) are used) to holding, MSA and ESA segments.
        7.3.5.1.2. Section 2, Chapter 2. VOR accuracies also apply to TACAN facilities.
        7.3.5.1.3. Section 3, Chapter 2, paragraph 2.6, Obstacle Identification Surface (OIS).
        Within GPD, the OIS origin begins at a height equivalent to the DER elevation. The
        origin height may be raised as high as 16 feet (or as high as what the host publishes)
        above the DER to eliminate penetrations to the OIS. When the host publishes a
        screen height other than 5 meters (16 feet), evaluate the departure using the host
 120                                                         AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


          published screen height. Establishing an origin height at an altitude greater than 16
          feet requires host nation approval. Whenever the origin height is raised above the
          DER elevation, publish a DER crossing height on the procedure.
          7.3.5.1.4. Section 3, Chapter 4, paragraph 4.3.1, Turn Initiation Area OIS. Apply
          paragraph 7.3.5.1.3.
          7.3.5.1.5. Section 4, Chapter 3, paragraph 3.2.1. The altitude at the initial approach
          fix shall be rounded to the nearest 50-meter increment (nearest 100-foot increment
          when non-SI units (feet) are used).
          7.3.5.1.6. Section 4, Chapter 3, Appendix A, Initial Approach Using Dead Reckoning
          (DR), Paragraph 3.1.2 a), First leg of the initial approach. When developing an S-
          type dead reckoning initial approach, the angle between the leg prior to the dead
          reckoning leg and the dead reckoning leg (at the start fix) shall not exceed 68°. Note:
          A 68° turn at the start fix corresponds with an inner edge that is 90° to the straight leg
          prior to the dead reckoning leg.
          7.3.5.1.7. Section 4, Chapter 5, paragraph 5.4.5.3.1, Remote Altimeter Setting. Not
          Applicable. Use AATCP-1, paragraph 233.
       7.3.5.2. Part II. Conventional Procedures.
          7.3.5.2.1. Section 1, Chapter 3, MLS. Not applicable. Use AF TERPS criteria.
          7.3.5.2.2. Section 1, Chapter 5, PAR. Not Applicable. For PAR final and missed
          approach segments, use AF TERPS criteria. For the remaining segments associated
          with PAR procedures, use ICAO PANS-OPS or AATCP-1.
          7.3.5.2.3. Section 2, Chapter 4, VOR or NDB with FAF. This chapter also applies to
          TACAN procedures. Note: See AATCP-1, Chapter 4 for additional TACAN
          guidance.
   7.3.6. Criteria in addition to AATCP-1 and ICAO PANS-OPS.
       7.3.6.1. Unless otherwise stated in ICAO PANS-OPS, the rise in secondary obstacle
       clearance surfaces is measured perpendicular to the nominal flight track.
       7.3.6.2. For construction of CAT II and CAT III procedures, manually enter an obstacle
       that represents taxiing aircraft, holding bays, or taxiway holding positions.
7.4. Use of Automation. When required to use automation for FTIP review (Chapter 3) or
when designing instrument procedures IAW NATO/PANS-OPS, use the GPD automation
software to the maximum extent possible. Use of GPD is mandatory when required to review or
design precision final approach segments IAW NATO/PANS-OPS. Note: Except for precision
final segments, when GPD does not support a particular segment type or procedure to be
reviewed or designed, manual methods for instrument procedure design and review is authorized.

                     USAF GLOBAL PROCEDURE DESIGNER (GPD)

8.1. Instrument Procedure Software. USAF Global Procedure Designer (GPD) is the only
software authorized for use when designing, reviewing, or maintaining IFPs and ATC charts.
TERPS functions with responsibility for developing, publishing, and maintaining instrument
procedures or ATC charts shall install and use the most current version of GPD as directed by
AFFSA. AFFSA recommends all users back-up GPD at least monthly and retain at a minimum
the most recent back-up on an approved medium external to the GPD computer. Use a network
shared drive, a digital video disc or a currently approved, portable, external hard drive to store
the back-up files. MAJCOMs should establish the process for maintaining the required back-up
files in a MAJCOM Operating Instruction (OI) or in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
8.2. Standard GPD Workflow. Follow the workflow outlined in the GPD Operating Manual,
Volume 1, Table 2-1. Certain critical steps are explained as follows (CAUTION: Failure to
follow the workflow sequence as described in Table 2-1 may result in loss of data);
   8.2.1. Evaluate accuracy and reconcile aeronautical data discrepancies. All data imported
   from DAFIF shall be verified against source to confirm correctness. Some values required
   for TERPS analysis are not contained in DAFIF and must be added as supplementary data.
   Add supplementary data as required. Ensure all coordinates entered into GPD are stated in
   the WGS-84 datum; convert when necessary. GPD will output Quality Reports that are
   intended to assist in aeronautical data resolution; maintaining hard copies of these documents
   is not required. The following data must be resolved in Data Manager prior to procedure
   development:
       8.2.1.1. Aerodrome assigned (magnetic) variation.
       8.2.1.2. Runway Physical, Landing, Takeoff and Displacement lengths (Figure 8.1 and
       Figure 8.2). Note: Figure 8.1 is a representation of where certain source data is
       displayed on the AIRPORT DIAGRAM in the DOD FLIP (Terminal) and is meant to be
       used in conjunction with Figure 8.2 to illustrate where general runway data are entered
       into GPD. Do not consider the data displayed on the AIRPORT DIAGRAM in the DOD
       FLIP (Terminal) source data.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 123


Figure 8.1. Runway Physical, Landing, Takeoff and Displacement Lengths.




      8.2.1.3. Supplementary Data. Enable supplementary data for each runway and add RVR
      availability when appropriate. Also enable the supplementary data for each visual
      glidepath system, adding TCH, VGSI angle and the light bar(s) distance from threshold
      (as appropriate). Ensure the approach light length is entered (to the nearest foot) in the
      Supplementary Data tab.
         8.2.1.3.1. Runway centerline elevations are required when developing ILS CAT II/III
         or PAR approaches with a HATh of less than 200 feet.
             8.2.1.3.1.1. Enter the runway centerline elevation for the point 200 feet prior to
             the runway threshold.
             8.2.1.3.1.2. Enter the runway centerline elevation every 500 feet from the runway
             threshold to a point 3,000 feet down the runway (in the landing direction). When
             runway centerline elevation data cannot be obtained from a runway survey, ILS
             CAT II/III or PAR approaches with a HATh of less than 200 feet are not
             authorized. Note: Runway centerline elevation data is available in most NGA
             airfield surveys. This data may also be available from HQ AFFSA/A3M.

Figure 8.2. Runway Physical, Landing, Takeoff and Displacement Lengths in GPD.




       8.2.1.4. Omni-directional NAVAIDs. Ensure that the NAVAID antenna elevation,
       assigned variation and radio class are entered.
       8.2.1.5. Airport NAVAIDS. Check all ILS glide slope and localizer data against source
       documentation. Ensure the localizer course is entered as a true value (vice magnetic).
       Ensure that the assigned variation of the localizer is the same as the aerodrome assigned
       variation.
       8.2.1.6. Add all ASR and PAR radar data, as needed.
       8.2.1.7. Enter sourced aeronautical data as outlined in the sub-paragraphs below. The
       following list is not all-inclusive but contains those data elements that most often will
       affect procedure development. Note: Some data elements (localizer course width,
       runway true bearing, precision threshold coordinates, etc.), will trigger an operational
       warning when the accuracy entered does not meet Radio Technical Commission for
       Aeronautics (RTCA) recommended standards; waiver action is not required when these
       standards are not met.
          8.2.1.7.1. Enter coordinates to the 0.01 second and the accuracy value as “0.005” in
          GPD for terminal VHF/UHF NAVAIDs, precision NAVAID (ILS/MLS)
          components, runway thresholds, fixes, and waypoints.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 125


        8.2.1.7.2. Field Elevation. Enter the elevation value to the nearest tenth of a foot and
        the accuracy value as “0.01” in GPD for the aerodrome reference point.
        8.2.1.7.3. Enter the elevation value to the nearest tenth of a foot and the accuracy
        value as “0.1 feet” in GPD for precision NAVAID (ILS/MLS) components and
        runway thresholds. Enter the accuracy value of “0.01” in GPD for the localizer
        width.
        8.2.1.7.4. Enter the elevation value to the nearest tenth of a foot and the accuracy
        value as “1 foot” in GPD for terminal VHF/UHF NAVAIDs.
        8.2.1.7.5. Threshold crossing height. Enter the TCH (or RDH, as applicable to FTIP)
        to the nearest hundredth of a foot in GPD. Note: GPD will populate the build and
        publication reports with the nearest whole foot value.
        8.2.1.7.6. Declination and magnetic variation (to include aerodrome and NAVAID
        assigned magnetic variation). Ensure assigned magnetic variation values used by
        GPD for locations in the CONUS and AF locations OCONUS are entered to the
        nearest whole degree (i.e., 10.0°; 4.0°, 38.0°, etc.) as assigned by HQ AFFSA/A3A.
        When using GPD to evaluate and document host nation instrument procedures for
        FTIP review or publication, ensure the magnetic variation values are entered exactly
        as reported in host nation source documentation. Note: When using a host nation
        NAVAID at an AF location to develop IFPs, and the NAVAID assigned magnetic
        variation is not a whole number, notify the host approval authority that the IFP was
        developed using the nearest whole degree.
        8.2.1.7.7. Course/bearing (to include runway bearing and localizer alignment). Enter
        the course or bearing to the nearest 0.01° and the accuracy value as “0.005” in GPD.
        8.2.1.7.8. Length/distance (to include runway lengths/widths and distances related to
        ILS/MLS components). Enter distances to the nearest whole foot and the accuracy
        value as “1 foot” in GPD. Note: Enter “0.005” as the accuracy value for localizer
        course width in GPD.
        8.2.1.7.9. Angular data (to include ILS/MLS and Precision RNAV Glidepath Angle
        and VGSI angle). Enter the angle to the nearest 0.01° and the accuracy value as
        “0.005” in GPD.
     8.2.1.8. Add supplementary Named Fix or Waypoint data (Figure 8.4). Fix data
     imported from DAFIF does not include any data other than its geodetic location.
     Additional data is required for the TERPS evaluation to determine fix error correctly.
     Unless the sole intent for a named fix is to support RNAV procedure development, add
     this supplementary data to all named fixes that are required for ground-based procedure
     design. Obtain this supplementary data from FAA Order 7350.8, Location Identifiers
     (Figure 8.3) or from source copy FAA Form 8260-2. Named fixes without the added
     supplementary data will be marked ―RNAV only‖ and displayed only when building
     RNAV procedures.
     8.2.1.9. Airspace. The DAFIF ingest process identifies incomplete airspaces. These
     airspaces will be deleted from the GPD database when “Delete Errors” is selected during
     import. Ensure all required airspaces are contained within the workspace.

   8.2.2. Evaluate the accuracy and completeness of obstacle data (see GPD Operations
   Manual, Vol 1, Table 2-1 and paragraph 11.6.3).
       8.2.2.1. Manually entered obstacles must be adjusted with the accuracy values according
       to their source (Figure 8.5 and Figure 8.6). Identify the obstacle by map search and apply
       the values from Table 8.4 when accuracies cannot be determined from the data source.
       8.2.2.2. Apply the worst-case horizontal and vertical accuracy from Table 8.4 and when
       unable to comply, annotate actions taken in GPD with user-entered notes.
       8.2.2.3. Horizontal and vertical accuracies derived from any source may be reduced to
       250 feet (75m) and 50 feet (15m), respectively, when confirmed by a flight inspection
       fly-by IAW FAA Order 8260.19, Appendix C, paragraph 2.b.(2)(f).

8.4. Additional GPD Considerations and Miscellaneous.
   8.4.1. GPD allows the instrument procedure designer the option to treat undetermined and
   unknown datums as if they were WGS-84. When this option is not exercised, it will result in
   a GPD violation that cannot be cleared. Therefore, when it appears that the obstacle in
   question may affect the instrument procedure, coordinate with NGA or the host nation for the
   location of the obstacle in the WGS-84 datum. When NGA or the host nation is not able to
   provide the location in the WGS-84 datum, check the WGS-84 box and apply the larger of
   the reported horizontal accuracy or the horizontal accuracy appropriate for an Operational
   Navigation Chart (ONC) or for a World Aeronautical Chart (WAC) from Table 8.3.
   8.4.2. For manual additions and revisions to aeronautical or obstacle data in GPD, geodetic
   coordinates must be entered in the WGS-84 datum. When source data is in another datum,
   coordinates must be converted prior to use.
   8.4.3. Do not use the GPD administrator log-in and password (ADMIN, ADMIN) when
   developing instrument procedures that will be used for flight operations.
   8.4.4. When using GPD to develop procedures to support FTIP review and the host nation
   only publishes the RDH in the AIP, take the following actions;
      8.4.4.1. ICAO and NATO criteria.
130                                                        AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


         8.4.4.1.1. Enter the host-specified RDH value in the ILS supplementary data. The
         runway crown elevation abeam GS antenna should be entered for GPD to compute
         the RPI. Annotate in the procedure remarks actions taken and the rationale used
         whenever calculated values are entered.
         8.4.4.1.2. Using the host nation threshold elevation, TCH and GS angle, and the
         calculated GPI, enter threshold elevation for GS antenna site elevation and the
         calculated GPI Distance as the GS antenna to threshold distance into Data Manager.
      8.4.4.2. USAF criteria.
         8.4.4.2.1. The RDH value may be entered, but the TCH, GPI and RPI are still
         calculated based on the glide slope site (ground) elevation and/or the crown elevation.
         8.4.4.2.2. Always chart “TCH” in the profile view even when using the RDH value.
  8.4.5. Workspace development. Do not establish the center of the workspace any farther
  than 5 NM from the following:
      8.4.5.1. The departure end of runway (DER) for departures;
      8.4.5.2. The airport reference point (ARP) for Diverse Vector Areas and circling
      approaches;
      8.4.5.3. The radar antenna/pseudo antenna for MVACs (for example, when the furthest
      segment of any automated procedure or chart is the MVAC centered on XYZ aerodrome
      for a 200 NM radius, establish a workspace large enough to encompass 205 NM from the
      chart center);
      8.4.5.4. The runway threshold (THR) for instrument approaches.
  8.4.6. GPD Terrain Data Warning. When both DTED Level 1 and DTED Level 2 files are
  imported to build a workspace, GPD will overwrite the DTED Level 1 data with DTED
  Level 2 data, cell for cell. When the DTED Level 2 cell has partial coverage, the previous
  data from DTED Level 1 cell will not be available to fill in the missing data. This may result
  in gaps in terrain data where terrain data once existed. GPD will provide an operational
  warning when a procedure or chart segment is constructed in an area with missing or
  incomplete terrain data. When this warning is encountered, unless the missing cells are
  entirely over water, make every reasonable attempt to obtain a digital product that provides
  coverage over the area. Check all available digital sources. After evaluating all available
  sources and digital terrain coverage in the area is still missing or incomplete, ensure the
  terrain environment is properly considered. Note: Whenever the digital resources noted in
  this paragraph are not available, a manual, hard-copy map study of the entire IFP or affected
  segment, as applicable, is required to evaluate the terrain elevation data.
      8.4.6.1. Determine the segment or sector of the instrument procedure with missing
      DTED coverage. GPD will indicate the area with missing terrain coverage. This can be
      done by scrolling the cursor in the 2-D view until the taskbar readout indicates “elevation

      8.4.6.2. Evaluate terrain in the area identified and add obstacles to Data Manager as
      necessary. Use of VMAP products is authorized to determine the highest contour
      elevation. Zoom in on the area of interest, use the info icon to determine the contour
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  131


     line’s object properties, and convert the “zv2” value from meters. Use good judgment to
     determine the density and location of obstacles added to Data Manager based on this
     search method. Consider the type procedure or segment being evaluated and the relative
     position of the area with incomplete terrain coverage. Add horizontal and vertical
     accuracies equivalent to the NGA 1:250,000 Joint Operations Graphic-Air (JOG) for
     VMAP1 and VMAP2 and equivalent to a WAC for VMAP0 (Table 8.3). After adding
     obstacles, revalidate segment and sector controlling obstacles for those procedure or chart
     portions that fall within an area with incomplete terrain coverage to determine if there are
     any remaining higher contours. Annotate in the procedure remarks actions taken along
     with supporting rationale. Note: When VMAP products are not available, a terrain
     analysis must be conducted on current, chummed paper copy maps scaled as required in
     Table 4.1. Document the results of the terrain analysis in the procedure package.
     CADRG maps are not authorized for terrain analysis.
     8.4.6.3. When DTED Level 1 is available with complete workspace coverage, importing
     DTED Level 2 or higher may not be necessary. Use of SRTM data is optional.

  8.4.7. Runway Terrain Exclusion Area (RTEA). Activate the RTEA feature within GPD
  only when DTED in the area of the runway threshold is higher than the actual terrain and is
  causing false penetrations to precision, visual area or departure obstruction surfaces.
  Document and retain the determination that DTED is higher than the actual terrain.
      8.4.7.1. When the RTEA is activated;
         8.4.7.1.1. Adjust the size of the RTEA to only be large enough to remove the false
         penetrations in the vicinity of the runway threshold. This task may require repeat
         adjustments to the size of the RTEA as the initial attempt may remove one or more
         false penetrations but additional false penetrations may appear even though the
         original penetration has been eliminated.
         8.4.7.1.2. Enter terrain points manually as obstacles into the GPD database to model
         the actual terrain within the RTEA area. The number of obstacles that must be
         entered into the GPD database will depend on the size of the RTEA. Ensure the
         terrain within the RTEA is accurately modeled.
      8.4.7.2. Terrain points can be obtained either by requesting a survey of the terrain within
      the RTEA or via map study. Use a map with contour elevation intervals close enough to
      provide an accurate terrain model. When entering these obstacles into the GPD database,
      utilize the adverse assumption technique to ensure GPD does not add the default 125 feet
      of vertical or 500 feet horizontal accuracy:
         8.4.7.2.1. Apply the one foot less than the map contour line interval and then subtract
         one additional foot. In the GPD Obstacle properties enter 1 foot in the AGL accuracy
         and 1 foot in the horizontal accuracy fields. By doing this, the actual terrain within
         the RTEA can be accurately modeled.
         8.4.7.2.2. Example. A point is located between contour elevations 315 and 320.
         Using the adverse assumption technique, the MSL altitude of the point is 319 feet.
         Now subtract one additional foot. Enter into the obstacle properties 318 feet for the
         MSL altitude, 1 foot AGL accuracy and 1 foot horizontal accuracy. With the data
         entered in this manner, the point will be evaluated by GPD as 319 feet MSL.
  8.4.8. TERPS Development Software Problem Reporting. Timely software problem
  reporting is essential to ensure errors are corrected within a reasonable timeframe. Do not
  attempt to develop local or MAJCOM-specific work-arounds. Submit an incident through
  the AFFSA TERPS helpdesk as soon as practical after encountering or suspecting a problem
  with the software or when suggesting software improvements.
  8.4.9. Documenting missed approach instructions. Document missed approach and alternate
  missed approach instructions in the Missed Approach Instructions tab of the Missed
  Approach Properties dialogue within the Instrument Procedure Designer module of GPD.
  8.4.10. When it is necessary to make multiple obstacle edits, they may be made in the Data
  Manager Module (one at a time) vice the Procedure Designer Module of GPD. Application
  of one or more of the following techniques to reduce processing time is optional.
      8.4.10.1. Disable the terrain analysis feature. When all obstacle edits have been
      completed, turn the terrain analysis feature back on.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   135


       8.4.10.2. Delete segments that do not require obstacle editing (except for segments
       required to support a limited GPD build). This can be done by performing the following
       steps, in order:
           8.4.10.2.1. Open a saved procedure;
           8.4.10.2.2. Delete segments that do not require obstacle editing;
           8.4.10.2.3. Make all appropriate obstacle edits;
           8.4.10.2.4. Close the procedure without saving it;
           8.4.10.2.5. Reopen the procedure. All segments and all holding pattern templates
           will then be restored with the obstacle edits.
       8.4.10.3. When a holding pattern contains obstacles requiring editing, reduce the number
       of templates to a single template. Note: Follow the steps in paragraph 8.4.10.2 except
       change the second step to read “Modify the holding pattern by ensuring the minimum
       altitude and the published altitude are identical.”
       8.4.10.4. ESA and MSA segments need only be developed and documented once.
       Separate the ESA and MSA evaluations from the associated IFP. Except for RNAV
       procedures, GPD will allow an ESA and MSA evaluation without having to evaluate a
       final, intermediate, initial or missed approach segment. RNAV approaches require
       building and evaluating a final segment before evaluation of the ESA or MSA. However,
       this technique will generate violations for not having the required segments in the
       instrument procedure and in the separated ESA and MSA evaluation. Note: Application
       of this technique does not make the procedure nonstandard and a waiver is not required.
       Place the following statement in the justification field of applicable violations: A
       separate ESA/MSA evaluation was accomplished as an acceptable technique to
       reduce GPD processing time/reduce package size (as applicable).
       8.4.10.5. Use a combination of paragraphs 8.4.10.1, 8.4.10.2, 8.4.10.3, or 8.4.10.4.
8.5. Use of Geographic Coordinates Derived from Hand-Held GPS Receivers. Any
instrument procedure developed using any coordinates that are derived solely from a hand-held
GPS receiver are nonstandard and require waiver. Clearly identify all data derived directly from
hand-held GPS receivers in the waiver request. Note: Using obstruction data derived from AF
civil engineering sources (CE maps, CIP files, etc.) does not require waiver action regardless of
the methodology or equipment used to gather the data.

                                        Attachment 3
            CLARIFICATION OF INSTRUMENT PROCEDURE CRITERIA

Section A3A–Clarification of FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1

A3.1. Purpose of this Attachment. This attachment clarifies and expands criteria in FAA
Order 8260.3 and AATCP-1 that are not complete or are open to interpretation. Apply FAA
Order 8260.3 Changes 1-21, AATCP-1 and this attachment. The criteria in AFI 11-230 take
precedence when there is any conflict with FAA Order 8260.3 or AATCP-1. Note: FAA Order
8260.3, Volume 1, Chapter 3 paragraph references have been updated to the new FAA Order
8260.3, Change 21 paragraph numbers.
A3.2. Paragraph 5b. Circling (Added). Do not design circling procedures for use with
precision instrument approach procedures. This does not apply to host nation locations (FTIP)
where the host country has authorized circling from a precision procedure that does not have an
accompanying nonprecision procedure (i.e., ILS and circling minima without localizer minima).
When authorizing localizer minima, circling procedures are appropriate (see AFMAN 11-217,
Volume 1, Chapter 15, for aircrew guidance on circling approaches).
A3.3. Paragraph 122a. Airport. This paragraph refers to FAA AC 150/5300-13, Airport
Design. Use AFI 32-1042, Standards for Marking Airfields, and UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and
Heliport Planning and Design in lieu of this FAA AC. Additionally, AFI 32-1044, Visual Air
Navigation Systems, and UFC 3-535-01, Visual Air Navigation Facilities, contain guidance
found in this FAA AC. Non-compliance with these Civil Engineering directives may require a
waiver approval through appropriate CE channels but do not require a TERPS waiver.
A3.4. Paragraph 141 NONSTANDARD PROCEDURES.                      Process waivers for military
procedures according to this instruction.
A3.5. Paragraph 142 CHANGES. Process all non-procedural changes according to DOD
FLIP, General Planning (GP), Chapter 11, Revision Schedules; Procedural changes shall be
processed through channels per paragraph 2.14.
A3.6. Paragraph 150d. Airspace Actions. Within the contiguous 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii
and where required by host nation regulations, ensure each instrument procedure’s primary
obstruction clearance areas are within controlled airspace. Apply requirements in paragraph
1.11.
A3.7. Paragraph 161 STRAIGHT-IN PROCEDURE IDENTIFICATION. When DME
and RADAR identify the FAF, add “RADAR or DME REQUIRED” to the planview of the
procedure unless this equipment is named in the procedure identification. Note: Except for
TACAN, this notation requirement for additional equipment applies to any equipment required
(e.g., “ADF or DME REQUIRED” or “ADF or RADAR REQUIRED”, etc.) that is not
included in the procedure identification or may be required to complete the approach; i.e., the
missed approach.
A3.8. Paragraph 163 DIFFERENTIATION. At AF locations where both high and low
altitude instrument approach or departure procedures are published in the same DOD or NACO
FLIP, a procedure can be identified as a HI/LO procedure, e.g., HI/LO TACAN or VOR/DME
Rwy 36. The FLIP procedure plate will be crosshatched along the upper left half of the top
 160                                                           AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


border and along the lower right half of the bottom border. Ensure ceiling and visibility
minimums for each required approach category are published.
A3.9. Paragraph 202 LEVEL OCS. 2000 feet of ROC should be applied to all holding
patterns published in designated mountainous terrain. When an operational advantage can be
achieved, the ROC may be reduced to no less than 1000 feet. Note: 2000 feet is applied to level
holding at the end of a missed approach, in departure holding and at holding prior to an IAF. Do
not apply 2000 feet to a Hold-in-Lieu of a Procedure Turn or to an ICAO racetrack segment.
A3.10. Paragraph 211 POSITIVE COURSE GUIDANCE (PCG). Use PCG, when
available, to develop missed approach segments. When direct to a radial/DME fix or direct to a
fix formed by intersecting radials (dead reckoning) is the only missed approach option, annotate
the procedure with the following note “Missed approach requires use of RNAV or ATC
RADAR monitoring” on the planview. This note mandates an aircraft use RNAV or that ATC
radar be operational and used by ATC to ensure compliance with the published missed approach
instructions, i.e., to act as a substitute for traditional PCG. The use of this note on the instrument
procedure does not preclude the issuance of alternate missed approach instructions. Note:
When the construction criteria in paragraph A3.10.1 cannot be met, and the note in this
paragraph is not operationally advantageous (not charted), the missed approach is nonstandard
and waiver action is required.
   A3.10.1. The note in paragraph A3.10 is not required in the following instances:
       A3.10.1.1. When developing any segment that starts at one NAVAID and goes directly
       to another NAVAID
       A3.10.1.2. When developing any segment that goes directly to a NAVAID
       A3.10.1.3. When developing any segment that involves starting at or overflying a
       NAVAID and reversing course back to the same NAVAID
       A3.10.1.4. Straight Missed Approach, provided
           A3.10.1.4.1. The missed approach segment is constructed directly to a NAVAID and
           then outbound on a radial to a fix (e.g., “Climb to 3100 then right turn direct ABC
           VOR then climbing left turn on ABC R-280 to (fix)” or
           A3.10.1.4.2. The missed approach segment is constructed to intercept a radial from
           an on-airport NAVAID. When this method is used, publish missed approach
           instructions to intercept the radial to the missed approach clearance limit (e.g.,
           “Climb to 4000 on ABC R-355 then climbing right turn 6000 direct to (clearance
           limit) …”
       A3.10.1.5. Turning Missed Approach, provided
           A3.10.1.5.1. The missed approach segment is constructed directly to a NAVAID and
           then outbound on a radial to a fix. When this method is used, publish missed
           approach instructions to turn to intercept the radial to the missed approach clearance

A3.11. Paragraph 215 CONTROLLING OBSTACLE(S). The controlling obstacle in the
final approach segment shall be identified for charting on all nonprecision instrument approach
procedures submitted to NGA. When submitting the obstacle data to NGA, do not add any
accuracy value; submit the reported MSL height of the obstacle. Controlling obstacles have
traditionally been the single highest obstruction in a segment or the obstruction with the greatest
amount of OCS penetration. However, advances in AF TERPS automation, including the use of
DTED (Level 1 or Level 2), SRTM and DVOF, will virtually assure that there will be multiple
obstructions with the same elevation (height) or an equal amount of OCS penetration identified
during instrument procedure segment construction. Apply the guidance in this paragraph when
determining which obstruction shall be identified as the controlling obstacle. “Obstacle” in this
context includes both terrain and man-made features. Adjustment for vertical and horizontal
accuracies must be added to man-made structures; the value of the reported or user-declared
vertical accuracy will be added to the MSL elevation of the obstruction to correctly identify the
controlling obstacle. For horizontal adjustments, the greater of either the reported or user-
declared horizontal accuracy or the accuracy of the geodetic coordinates will be considered, in
effect creating a three-dimensional cylinder of a specified height and radius. Note: NGA will
chart all requested obstacles IAW current charting specifications and cartographic judgment.

  A3.11.1. Equivalent Height Definition. When PCG is provided and both primary and
  secondary areas are being evaluated to determine a segment’s controlling obstacle,
  obstructions in the secondary area are evaluated based on their equivalent height value. The
  equivalent height value for obstructions in secondary areas is determined by subtracting the
  amount of OCS rise in the secondary area (measured from the edge of the primary area to the
  obstruction) from the obstruction’s reported MSL elevation. This adjusted (lower) MSL
  elevation value is known as the obstruction’s “equivalent height.” Note: Even though the
  precision final segment X surface is primary area, an equivalent height is determined for both
  the X and Y surfaces. The equivalent height is determined by the obstruction’s MSL
  elevation, minus the amount of X or Y surface rise (combined, when applicable) from the
  edge of the W surface.
  A3.11.2. Effective Height Definition. When adding vertical accuracy to an obstruction’s
  reported MSL elevation, the resulting value is known as the obstruction’s “effective height.”
      A3.11.2.1. The effective height of an obstruction in the primary area with a reported
      vertical accuracy is equal to its reported MSL value plus vertical accuracy.
      A3.11.2.2. The effective height of an obstruction in the secondary area with a reported
      vertical accuracy is equal to its reported MSL value plus vertical accuracy minus
      secondary OCS rise.
      A3.11.2.3. The minimum segment altitude would be defined as an obstruction’s effective
      height plus the appropriate ROC for the segment plus ROC adjustments.
  A3.11.3. Segment or Sub-segment. For the purposes of this paragraph, a procedure segment
  or sub-segment generally starts at the fix or point encountered first as the procedure is flown
  and ends at the fix or point marking the beginning of the next segment. Example 1: A
  nonprecision final approach segment starts at the FAF and ends at the MAP. Example 2: A
  12-DME arc initial segment starts at the IAF and ends at the intermediate fix or point.

      controlling obstacle shall be the obstruction with the highest height or highest effective
      height, as applicable.
         A3.11.4.1.1. When multiple obstructions have the same highest height or same
         highest effective height, select the one closest to the end of segment line along the

             OCS, select the one that is farthest away from the missed approach point (MAP),
             using the appropriate method for measuring this distance. Note: The obstruction
             farthest from the MAP shall be selected as it can be equated to the obstruction that
             would have required the highest climb-to-altitude if a penetration had existed.
             A3.11.6.1.2.3. When multiple obstructions are equally close to penetrating the
             OCS and are the same distance from the MAP, select the one closest to the

       waypoint).
       A3.11.9.3. When there are multiple obstructions resulting in the same minimum altitude

       the sector or area edge.
A3.12. Paragraph 220 FEEDER ROUTES. Do not construct feeder routes containing a turn
point defined by a fix between the feeder facility and the IAF.
A3.13. Paragraph 221 MINIMUM SAFE/SECTOR ALTITUDES (MSA). Apply guidance
from paragraph 221 but note that the navigation facility on which a procedure is based may not
always provide the pilot with the most useful origin for the MSA. If more useful information can
be obtained from a facility other than the one on which the procedure is based, use that facility
provided it is within 30 miles of the airport. Chart this facility as the MSA origin only after the
instrument procedure designer has completed coordination with all concerned agencies. Center
the MSA at the MAWP on all straight-in RNAV (GPS) approaches.
A3.14. Paragraph 230 INITIAL APPROACH SEGMENT. The initial approach segment
may be made up of a single segment or a series of sub-segments. Each sub-segment can be a
straight course or radial, an arc, a PT, a teardrop turn, penetration turn, a course reversal based on
non-collocated facilities, a hold-in-lieu of PT or a dead reckoning sub-segment.
   A3.14.1. When the turn between initial sub-segments equals or exceeds 90°, a radial or
   bearing which provides at least 2 NM lead shall be identified. Ensure a radial or bearing that
   provides at least 2 NM lead is published on all arc segments prior to intersecting the next
   segment.
   A3.14.2. When altitudes are specified at the fixes marking both the beginning and end of a
   segment or a sub-segment (to include stepdown fixes), initial descent gradient criteria shall
   be applied.
   A3.14.3. Straight and Arc Courses. The turn between a straight or arc sub-segment and the
   following sub-segment shall not exceed 120°. Turns greater than 120° require a course
   reversal sub-segment.
   A3.14.4. Course Reversals. Straight or arc sub-segment(s) may precede a course reversal
   sub-segment (PT, high altitude teardrop penetration turn, course reversal based on non-
   collocated facilities or hold-in-lieu of PT). However, the course reversal sub-segment must
   be the last sub-segment encountered prior to reaching the intermediate or final approach
   segment. This restriction does not apply when FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1, paragraph
   244e(1) is applied.
       A3.14.4.1. Procedure Turn (PT). When a sub-segment precedes the PT, use the Initial
       Approach Fix (IAF) crossing altitude when applying FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1,
       paragraph 234b and Table 1 to determine the PT primary area dimensions. Note: Unless
       the procedure turn/penetration turn distance is indicated by the appropriate DME fix,
 168                                                          AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


       ensure a remain within distance equal to the “Procedure Turn Length” or the “Specified
       Penetration Turn Distance” listed on the GPD Publication Report is charted on all
       instrument procedures using a PT or a teardrop turn for course reversal; e.g., “Remain
       within 10 NM” or “Remain within 24 NM”.
       A3.14.4.2. High Altitude Teardrop Penetration Turn. When determining the penetration
       turn distance and course divergence from FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1, Paragraph 235b,
       and Table 2, do not consider the altitude loss in the sub-segment prior to the penetration
       turn fix or facility. Delay before descent shall only be applied from the penetration turn
       fix or facility.
       A3.14.4.3. Hold-in-lieu of Procedure Turn. The minimum holding sub-segment altitude
       shall be no lower than the IAF crossing altitude of the preceding sub-segment (when
       specified).
   A3.14.5. Dead Reckoning. A dead reckoning sub-segment must be the last sub-segment
   encountered prior to reaching the intermediate or final approach segment.
A3.15. Paragraph 231 ALTITUDE SELECTION. The altitude selected shall not be below
the teardrop completion altitude where a teardrop is required.
A3.16. Paragraph 232a(1). Courses. Also apply this paragraph when both segments are initial
segments.
A3.17. Paragraph 232b. Area. When the arc radius is greater than 4 NM but less than 6 NM,
the radius of the inner secondary arc shall be zero. When the arc radius is less than or equal to 4
NM, then the radius of the inner primary arc shall be zero and there shall be no secondary inner
arc.
A3.18. Paragraph 234d. Descent Gradient. When the difference between the PT completion
altitude and the FAF altitude exceeds the altitude difference limits shown in Table 1B, round the
required excess altitude up to the next 100-foot increment. For example, if the required excess
altitude is 310 feet, round up to 400 feet. This will result in an increase of 2 miles to the PT
length and maneuvering zone.
A3.19. Paragraph 235 INITIAL APPROACH BASED ON HIGH ALTITUDE
TEARDROP PENETRATION. This criteria shall be used in situations where the altitude to be
lost is 5000 feet or more. Where less than 5000 feet of altitude is to be lost, a PT or other initial
segment criteria shall be used. When the procedure requires a delay before descent of more than
5 miles, the distance in excess of 5 miles (e.g., descent is delayed 8 miles; excess distance is 3
miles) shall be added to the distance the turn commences.
A3.20. Paragraph 235b. Area. (1) Size. The altitude to be lost in the procedure in the third
sentence; “The penetration turn distance depends on the altitude to be lost in the procedure and
the point at which the descent is started (see table 2)” refers to the altitude between the IAF and
the runway threshold.
A3.21. Paragraph 243 INTERMEDIATE APPROACH SEGMENT BASED ON AN ARC.
Application of this paragraph is not authorized.
A3.22. Paragraph 252 VERTICAL DESCENT ANGLE. Construct NPA procedures, except
those published in conjunction with vertically guided minima, to provide a vertical descent angle
(VDA)/TCH that is coincident with the associated VGSI angle/TCH. When VGSI is not
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                169


installed, when the VGSI angle is not between 2.50° and 3.50° or when the VGSI TCH is not
within the parameters of FAA Order 8260.3, Vol 3, Chapter 2, Table 2-3, construct a VDA ≥
2.50° or ≤ 3.50° (optimum is 3°) with an appropriate TCH value from Table 2-3. Except when
VGSI is not installed, ensure the note “VGSI and descent angles not coincident (VGSI Angle
{angle} TCH {feet})” is charted in the profile view of the procedure when the VGSI angle is
more than 0.2° from the GPA or when the VGSI TCH is more than 3 feet from the procedure
TCH.
   A3.22.1. Except for ASR approaches, ensure the VDA and TCH are charted on each NPA
   procedure.
   A3.22.2. Whenever precision/vertically guided approach glidepath angles and/or TCH
   values are not coincident with VGSI data, publish the following note, “VGSI and
   (ILS/MLS/PAR/ TLS/LNAV/VNAV/RNAV, as appropriate) glidepath not coincident
   (VGSI Angle {angle} TCH {feet})”. Note: Also ensure this note is charted with the IFP
   when flight inspection has made this determination.
   A3.22.3. When no other option is practical and a stepdown fix altitude on a straight-in
   aligned procedure is above the VDA from FAF to TCH, publish the greatest VDA along with
   the TCH and associate it with the applicable stepdown fix with a note, e.g., “*SDF to MAP:
   3.26/55” or “*LISSA to RW19L: 3.10/50” on the approach plate.
   A3.22.4. Establish stepdown fix altitudes in the final approach segment of a straight-in
   approach without regard to the CMDA value; i.e., these stepdown fix altitudes do not need to
   be equal to or greater than the CMDA.
      A3.22.4.1. Each stepdown fix altitude in the final approach segment shall be equal to or
      greater than the lowest straight-in MDA and equal to or greater than the altitude at any
      subsequent stepdown fix.
      A3.22.4.2. When establishing stepdown fixes on a circling only approach, each
      stepdown fix altitude shall be equal to or greater than the lowest CMDA and equal to or
      greater than the altitude at any subsequent stepdown fix.
A3.23. Paragraph 253 VISUAL DESCENT POINT (VDP). This guidance is applicable to
straight-in instrument procedures only. With the exception of ARA and ASR approaches,
establish a VDP for all straight-in, NPA procedures. When publishing a VDP, identify the
location of the VDP by DME or by the NM distance to the threshold. Exceptions may apply to
procedures outside CONUS (i.e., host nation procedures and military bases applying AATCP-1
criteria).
   A3.23.1. A VDP fix can be less than one mile from a stepdown fix or missed approach point,
   provided chart clarity is not compromised.
   A3.23.2. When a VDP cannot be published, ensure the reason is documented in the
   procedure package.
   A3.23.3. When using a non-collocated DME source to identify the VDP, the angle of
   divergence between the DME facility and the final approach course shall not exceed 23°.
   The maximum allowable fix error is .54 NM. When GPD generates a fix error violation of
   .54 NM or less, justify the violation with this paragraph; waiver action is not required.
 170                                                          AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


A3.24. Paragraph 270 MISSED APPROACH SEGMENT.                         Missed approach segments
using DME arcs are not permitted.
A3.25. Paragraph 272 MAP. A crossing radial may be used to define the missed approach
point (MAP). When using this option, the procedure is nonstandard and requires waiver
processing. The maximum acceptable fix error is 1/2 mile for a crossing radial. When
considering missed approach point locations using a DME fix or a crossing radial, establish the
MAP at or prior to the first usable landing surface. The on-airport NAVAID may be identified
as the MAP only when a usable, satisfactory DME fix or crossing radial is not available.
A3.26. Paragraph 274 STRAIGHT MISSED APPROACH OBSTACLE CLEARANCE.
Instances may occur when an obstruction penetrates the 40:1 precision or nonprecision missed
approach surface and other solutions (e.g., DA or MDA adjustments) are not feasible. Apply the
appropriate formula from paragraph A4.17 and publish a climb gradient that clears the
obstruction. Required minimum climb rate information must be graphically displayed on the
procedure. The altitude or fix to which the climb gradient must be maintained shall be
published. A climb gradient required to prevent a climb-in-hold situation at the end of the
missed approach segment shall not be considered nonstandard. Note: Guidance in this
paragraph also applies to FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 1, paragraphs 276, and 277a through 277d.
A3.27. Paragraphs 274b, 276e and 277d. When the clearance limit is located on an enroute
airway, the charted missed approach altitude shall not be lower than the applicable MEA. When
the clearance limit is not part of the enroute structure, the charted missed approach altitude
should not be lower than the highest MIFRAC sector altitude (USAF IFR facility) or the highest
En Route Minimum IFR Altitude Chart sector altitude (FAA IFR facility) within any portion of
the missed approach primary area. For turning missed approach, consider the highest MIFRAC
sector altitude that falls within any portion of the missed approach primary area for all authorized
approach categories. When it is not practical to ensure the missed approach altitude is at or
above the highest MIFRAC sector altitude within any portion of the missed approach primary
area, apply paragraphs 274b, 276e or 277d, as appropriate, and chart the note “RADAR
REQUIRED.” Note: Radar coverage must exist throughout the missed approach segment and
the clearance limit and missed approach altitude must be within the service volume of the
NAVAID(s) that define the clearance limit.
A3.28. Paragraph 276b. More Than 90° Turn. The altitude of the OCS for any point in Zone
3 shall start at the lowest MDA minus the sum of the ROC plus adjustments for the final
approach at Point B and rise by the OCS gradient from point B. Zone 3 obstacle measurements
extend to the edge of the secondary area and then extend perpendicular to the missed approach
course into the secondary.
A3.29. Paragraph 282 COURSE/DISTANCE FIXES. Describe in nautical miles when a
“fly-off” (level flight) is maintained from the primary facility or fix before the beginning of the
penetration turn, PT, or descent. Depict the beginning of the penetration turn, PT, or descent on
the planview and profile by DME values when available.
A3.30. Paragraph 288c(3). Altitude at the Fix. Round altitudes to the nearest 20-foot or 100-
foot increment, as applicable.
A3.31. Paragraph 288c(4)(a). USAF N/A when an operational requirement exists and waiver
action is not required. Justify GPD violation by entering the operational requirement.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                    171


A3.32. Paragraph 289 OBSTACLES CLOSE TO A FINAL APPROACH OR
STEPDOWN FIX. Comply with FAA Order 8260.19, paragraph 8-57.f.(1); chart only the
highest obstacle in the 7:1 area on the approach plate.
A3.33. Paragraph 293 OBSTACLE CLEARANCE. Use the appropriate speed group as
specified in FAA Order 7130.3, paragraph 2-28 when a climb-in-hold evaluation is necessary.
Use the template required for the climb-in-hold assessment for the level holding evaluation.
Select a higher template number for the evaluation when the required template size does not
encompass the ending width of the segment at the holding fix.
A3.34. Paragraph 3 1 Establishment. Do not establish or publish alternate minima for AF
procedures. Alternate minima are given in AFI 11-202V3, or as supplemented by each
MAJCOM. Publish takeoff minimums (a ceiling and visibility) for civil aircrews to see and
avoid obstructions whenever a DP is published for civilian use to include joint civil-military use
IAW FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 4, paragraph 1.4.6. Note: Reference the Civil Reserve Air
Fleet (CRAF) and other DOD contracted civil aircraft; provide takeoff minimums only when
notified by the carrier that takeoff minimums are required.
A3.35. Paragraph 3 2.2b Precipitous terrain adjustments. Do not apply precipitous terrain
adjustments to AF instrument procedures, including FTIP.
A3.36. Paragraph 3 3.2 Manually calculate visibilities IAW this section using Table 3-5a from
FAA Order 8260.3b, Change 23. GPD is programed with an earlier version of this table and may
not output the correct visibility values. Continue to manually check GPD visibility values until
the software is upgraded (Service Pack 9) to comply with this newer guidance.
A3.37. Paragraph 3 3.2c.(2)(b). Restrict night operations when the 20:1 OIS is penetrated and
the VGSI is not operating or not installed. Night operations may continue unrestricted when a
VGSI is installed and operating and the location of the penetrating obstacle(s) is indicated on the
approach chart or in the FTIP review. For straight-in approaches, reference the location of the
obstacle to the course. For circling approaches, reference the location of the obstacle to the
runway centerline. Apply the following whenever the 20:1 OIS is penetrated and the penetrating
obstacle(s) cannot be marked and lighted or it is not known if the penetrating obstacles are
marked and lighted. Note: The VGSI system may be set at an angle as low as 2.5°. Reference
FAA Order 8260.3, Change 20, paragraph 3.3.2d.(2)(d), the VGSI OCS clearance verification
may be obtained from Civil Engineer personnel. Do not include the horizontal or vertical
accuracy values when publishing the height and location of the 20:1 OIS penetration(s) in any
FLIP (DOD, FAA or Jeppesen®) document.
   A3.37.1. When a VGSI system is installed, the approach chart or FTIP review must be
   annotated to indicate the height and location of the unlit 20:1 OIS penetration(s) located in
   the STRAIGHT-IN or in the OFFSET visual area. Example note:
   “Unlit antenna 86′ AGL/1820′ MSL, 2430′ prior to threshold, 170′ right of course”

       A3.37.1.1. Chart the following required note to indicate to all users the straight-in
       approach procedure and circling to the runway is not authorized at night:
   “When VGSI inop, procedure NA at night”
172                                                         AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


      A3.37.1.2. USAF exception: Chart the following note to inform USAF aircrews that the
      approach may be used to land straight-in at night only after they have requested and
      received approval from their MAJCOM A3 (or equivalent):
  “USAF Only: When VGSI inop, straight-in RWY XX authorized at night with
  MAJCOM A3 approval”

      A3.37.1.3. Whenever circling minimums are published and one or more runways have
      20:1 OIS penetrations, chart the following note to inform the pilot that circling to each of
      the affected runways is not authorized at night when the VGSI is inoperable:
  “CAUTION: When RWY (XX, XY, XZ, as applicable) VGSI inop, circling to RWY
  (XX, XY, XZ, as applicable) NA at night”

  A3.37.2. When a VGSI is not installed or when unable to determine whether or not a VGSI
  is installed, the requirements in paragraph A3.23.1 remain the same. The approach chart or
  FTIP review must be annotated to indicate the height and location of the unlit 20:1 OIS
  penetration(s). Example note:
  “Unlit steeple 190′ AGL/2270′ MSL, 2950′ prior to threshold, 185′ left of
  (course/centerline)”

      A3.37.2.1. In this case, chart the following required note to indicate to all users the
      straight-in approach procedure and circling to the runway is not authorized at night:
  “Procedure NA at night”

      A3.37.2.2. USAF exception: Chart the following note to inform USAF aircrews that the
      approach may be used to land straight-in at night only after they have requested and
      received approval from their MAJCOM A3 (or equivalent):
  “USAF Only: Straight-in RWY XX authorized at night with MAJCOM A3 approval”

      A3.37.2.3. Whenever circling minimums are published and one or more runways have
      20:1 OIS penetrations, chart the following note to inform the pilot that circling to each of
      the affected runways is not authorized at night:
  “CAUTION: Circling to RWY (XX, XY, XZ, as applicable) NA at night”

  A3.37.3. When charting the notes in paragraphs A3.23.1 and A3.23.2 and numerous like
  obstacles need to be annotated, group the obstacles in the note as in this example:
  “Unlit Terrain/Trees/Towers (as applicable) beginning 1245′ prior to threshold, 250′ left
  of (course/centerline), up to 2910′ MSL”

  A3.37.4. Night operations are authorized without the notes described in paragraphs A3.23.1
  and A3.23.2 when the TERPS evaluation confirms there are no penetrations to the 20:1 OIS.
  A3.37.5. Whenever Category A minima are affected by penetrations to the 20:1 or 34:1 OIS,
  also apply the notation requirements in FAA Order 8260.19, paragraph 8-54. i. (3).
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  173


A3.38. Paragraphs        413a(2),    513a(2)(b),    613a(2),    and      713a(2)(b);    Circling
Approach. Circling approach alignment criteria, using on-airport facilities, permits the use of
all radials (360°). The AF does not recognize the requirement for the final approach course to be
aligned to (pass through or over) any portion of the usable landing surface. This criterion is
applicable to on-airport VOR (no FAF); TACAN, VOR/DME, and VOR with FAF; NDB on-
airport (no FAF); and NDB with FAF circling procedures.
A3.39. Paragraph 523b. Arc Final Approach. Do not apply.
A3.40. Paragraphs 613c(1); Obstacle Clearance. Straight-In. NDB procedures with no FAF
developed using the reduced ROC of 300 feet (military exception) shall have the following note
published in the planview: NOT FOR CIVIL USE. Do not publish this note on NDB
procedures developed using the standard ROC of 350 feet unless required for a different reason.
A3.41. Paragraph 713c(1); Obstacle Clearance. Straight-In. NDB procedures with a FAF
developed using the reduced ROC of 250 feet (military exception) shall have the following note
published in the planview: NOT FOR CIVIL USE. Do not publish this note on NDB
procedures developed using the standard ROC of 300 feet unless required for a different reason.
A3.42. Appendix 5, paragraph 1 APPROACH LIGHTING SYSTEMS. The sequenced
flashers are part of the approach lighting system but are not considered when applying credit for
approach lights to instrument procedure visibility minima. Inoperative sequenced flashers do not
affect published visibility minima.
   A3.42.1. When Runway Alignment Indicator Lights (RAIL) are part of the approach lighting
   system (Medium Intensity Approach Lighting System with Runway Alignment Indicator
   Lights [MALSR] and Short Simplified Approach Lighting System with Runway Alignment
   Indicator Lights [SSALR]) and the RAIL portion of the system becomes inoperative, revert
   to no-light visibility minima.
   A3.42.2. The AF does not apply the INOPERATIVE COMPONENTS OR VISUAL AIDS
   TABLE found on the inside of the front cover of the FAA FLIP. Ensure ALS inoperative
   notes are charted when applying credit for approach lights to instrument procedure visibility
   minima. This policy applies to all instrument procedures developed by the AF and published
   in the DOD FLIP (Terminal) and to all FTIP reviewed by the AF for publication in the DOD
   FLIP (Terminal) or for posting to GDSS (paragraph 3.19). Figure 6.1 provides sample ALS
   inoperative notes and implement the intent of FAA Order 8260.19, paragraph 8-54.m.(3).
Section A3B–Clarification of FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 3

A3.43. Paragraphs 1. 2.14, 1.2.15, and 2.11; Obstacle Free Zones (OFZs). FAA imaginary
surfaces do not apply to AF airfields; therefore AF locations do not have runway, inner
approach, or inner transitional OFZs. Do not restrict approach minimums based on any FAA
imaginary surface penetration.
A3.44. Paragraph 2 5; MAXIMUM AUTHORIZED GPA’S. Except for LNAV/VNAV
GPA’s, apply Vol I, Chapter 3, Table 3-4 to determine the minimum and maximum allowable
GPA’s and minimum HATh for precision and APV approach procedures. The use of any GPA
value outside the values in Table 3-4 and the use of any HATh value lower than the minimum
values from Table 3-4 requires waiver. Note: See paragraph A3.48 for LNAV/VNAV GPA
limitations.

A3.45. Paragraph 2 6.1; Category I Threshold Crossing Height (TCH) Requirements.
WCH violations may be justified in GPD by publishing a caution note on the IFP and in the IFR
Supplement listing all affected aircraft types from the applicable height group(s) from Table 2-3
and the nonstandard WCH(s). Sample note: CAUTION: ILS Rwy 21; B-747/767/777, L-
1011, DC-10, A-300, B-1, KC-10, E-4, C-5 and VC-25 Wheel Crossing Height 18 ft. Waiver
action is not required. Note: GPD will be upgraded to automatically generate the proper caution
note in a future version.
A3.46. Paragraph 2 9; DETERMINING PFAF/FAF COORDINATES. The formula in
paragraph 2.9 provides a distance from the PFAF to the GPI. To obtain a distance from the LTP
to the PFAF, subtract the GPI distance from distance “D” (D-GPI). The formula in paragraph
2.9 also incorporates the altitude loss (z) between the PFAF elevation and the elevation of the
LTP. The elevation of the LTP is the elevation of the threshold (and ASBL). The calculation
based on “z” and a given GS angle will provide a distance from the PFAF to a point where an
altitude loss equal to “z” has occurred. This point will be beyond the threshold where the GS
intersects the ASBL; the GPI point.
A3.47. Paragraph 2 12; GLIDEPATH QUALIFICATION SURFACE (GQS). When GPD
determines a GQS penetration, manually apply FAA Order 8260.3, Change 21, Volume 3,
paragraph 2.11 until Change 21 is incorporated into GPD. When a manual evaluation results in
no GQS penetrations or in allowable GQS penetrations, document the results in the Approach
Procedure Design Notes. Allowable GQS penetrations for the AF shall have an effective height
at or below a 50:1 surface (a grade of 2.0 %). When evaluating the GQS for CAT III operations,
the GQS will extend from the runway threshold to a DA point that is equivalent to a 100 foot
HATh.
A3.48. Paragraph 3 3; PRECISION OBJECT FREE AREA (POFA). The term “precision
obstacle free area (POFA)” has been changed to “precision obstacle free zone (POFZ).” The
shaded area in Figure A3.1 is the POFZ (800 feet wide centered on runway centerline, extending
200 feet past threshold) and must be evaluated by TERPS to protect aircraft executing a missed
approach.
   A3.48.1. For unrestricted instrument procedures, no above ground objects, regardless of
   frangibility, are permitted in the POFZ except for taxiing aircraft or taxiing aircraft holding
   temporarily and those required for air navigation or aircraft ground maneuvering purposes.
   Note: Reference taxiing or holding aircraft, only horizontal surfaces (e.g., aircraft wings)
   can penetrate the POFZ, but not the vertical surfaces (e.g., fuselage or tail).
   A3.48.2. Parked aircraft (i.e., parking ramps, arm and de-arm areas, hot brake areas, etc.)
   and those deviations permitted by UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 13, paragraph B-13-
   2, that cannot be classified as “necessary for air navigation or aircraft ground maneuvering”
   (i.e., maintenance facilities, barrier shacks, etc.) are not permitted in this area without
   incurring TERPS penalties. When the area is not clear of permissible above ground obstacles
   or objects or when parking spots, arm and de-arm areas, hot brake areas, etc. are designated
   within the POFZ, do not publish HATh and visibility for CAT I precision approaches (i.e.,
   PAR, ILS, MLS, etc.) less than 250 feet and ¾ statute mile respectively.
   A3.48.3. When the POFZ cannot be protected or is not being protected by ATC IAW FAA
   Order 7110.65, and obstacles have been added to the database in the POFZ, ensure the “HAT
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 175


   due to POFA Penetrations” box is checked in the Precision Final Segment Properties window
   of GPD. This will ensure the TERPS penalty to the HATh and visibility are applied.

PENETRATIONS. Application of this method need not require a DA that is more than 250 feet
above the penetrating obstacle; however, the minimum HATh is 250 feet.
A3.50. Paragraph 4 0; GENERAL.           Glidepath angles below 2.70° and above 3.80° are

to or greater than 90° regardless of the number of turns. All lead points must be established to
provide only a 2 NM lead. When establishing a lead point using a crossing radial, the angle of
divergence between the crossing radial and the departure course shall not be less than 45°. When
establishing a lead point using DME, the angle of divergence between the DME facility and the
departure course shall not exceed 23°. Note: USAF GPD will not construct or evaluate the
obstacle clearance area properly when establishing nonstandard lead points greater than 2 NM.

   A3.52.1. Paragraph 2.0, ACCEPTABLE OBSTACLES. Use Table A3.1 to determine
   whether a penetrating obstruction can be considered acceptable.
       A3.52.1.1. When an obstruction penetrates the final approach W and X surfaces, AND is
       not considered acceptable; CAT II minimums are not authorized.
       A3.52.1.2. When an obstruction penetrates the missed approach section 1 surfaces
       (except surface A1 extended) AND is not considered acceptable, adjust the DA in
       accordance with the FAA Memorandum, paragraph 6.8.
       A3.52.1.3. When an obstruction penetrates the missed approach section 1 surfaces
       (except surface A1 extended), AND is not considered acceptable, AND cannot be
       mitigated by adjusting the DA, CAT II minimums are not authorized.
   A3.52.2. Paragraph 6.9.1, Section 1.
       A3.52.2.1. The area begins at the end of the final OCS trapezoid and is aligned with a
       continuation of the final approach course, continuing in the direction of landing for a
       distance of 9,200 feet, excluding extensions.
       A3.52.2.2. It is comprised of 5 surfaces; surface A, surface B, surface C, surface D, and
       surface A1. Surfaces A, B, C, and D must not be penetrated unless the penetrating
       obstacle is either deemed acceptable per Table A3.1, or mitigated by raising the DA.
       A3.52.2.3. Surface A1 or Surface A1 extended must not be penetrated, unless the
       penetrating obstacle is either deemed acceptable per Table A3.1, or the procedure is
       published with a missed approach climb gradient.
       A3.52.2.4. Use the variable definitions and formulas listed in the FAA Memorandum,
       paragraph 6.9.1 to calculate the MSL height of the OCS at any given distance (X) from
       threshold and (Y) from runway centerline.

                    INSTRUMENT PROCEDURE DESIGNER GUIDE

Section A4A–GPI, RPI and TCH Computations

A4.1. ILS and MMLS Application. Calculate GPI, RPI, and TCH for ILS procedures IAW
FAA Order 8240.52. See Figure A4.1, Figure A4.2, and Figure A4.3 for sample calculations.
Factors that influence these computations include the glidepath angle (GPA), runway threshold
elevation, glide slope site (ground) elevation, glide slope antenna to threshold distance, and
runway crown elevation abeam the glide slope antenna.
   A4.1.1. For an existing ILS, enter the appropriate elevation (either site or crown elevation)
   used during commissioning flight inspection of the ILS system as the Glide Slope “Ground
   elevation” on the ILS properties page. Also enter this value in Block 40 of FAA Form 7900-
   6, Instrument Landing System Data Form.
   A4.1.2. For a new ILS or a relocated glide slope, ATCALS personnel will provide the
   elevation to be used for computations. Enter this elevation as the Glide Slope “Ground
   elevation” on the ILS properties page and in Block 40 of FAA Form 7900-6. In order for
   GPD to compute the RPI, the crown elevation must be entered on the ILS Supplementary
   Data tab.
   A4.1.3. For MMLS procedures, replace ILS glide slope antenna to threshold distance with
   MMLS elevation antenna to threshold distance. Add the height of the center of the elevation
   antenna phase array (normally 5 ft) to the elevation antenna site elevation and use the result
   in the place of the ILS glide slope antenna elevation.

A4.2. GPN 22/25 and TPN-19 PAR Systems. Computing RPI is not necessary. The RPI is
determined during system installation and should be coincident with the ILS RPI (where an ILS
is installed). When no other precision landing aid is installed, the instrument procedure designer
will determine RPI to achieve the desired TCH consistent with mission aircraft. The
“Touchdown (Kft)” value on the site parameter panel represents the distance from the RPI to the
point abeam the PAR antenna, not the distance from the RPI to the threshold. In order to use the
correct value for coincidence issues or FAA Form 7900-6 input, ensure the RPI value used is
from the threshold.
A4.3. FPN-62 and MPN-14K PAR Systems. The RPI (touchdown) is a calculated point on the
runway centerline using the requested GS and TCH for the procedure. The touchdown reflector
is located at a point on an arc, abeam the runway centerline between the PAR antenna and the
threshold where the arc centered on the PAR antenna is swung at a distance equal to the distance
from the PAR antenna to the RPI (Figure A4.4). The RPI is determined during system
installation and should be coincident with the ILS RPI (where an ILS is installed). When no
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                       181


other precision landing aid is installed, the instrument procedure designer will determine RPI to
achieve the desired TCH consistent with mission aircraft.

Figure A4.4. PAR RPI (Touchdown) Distance from Runway Threshold.




Note: This figure is not to scale and provided only to illustrate the relationships between and
among the various points involved. The distance from the PAR antenna to the touchdown
reflector is equal to the distance from the PAR antenna to the RPI (touchdown).

A4.4. Threshold Crossing Height (TCH). The TCH is the height of the glide slope directly
above the runway threshold. Normally, this value is computed mathematically for an ILS. Use
FAA Order 8260.3, Figure A5-2., to determine the TCH for scanning PAR systems. Use FAA
Order 8260.3, Figure A5-3., to determine the TCH for tracking PAR systems.
Section A4B–Selection of TACAN and VOR Final Approach Radials for On-Airport Facilities

A4.5. Alignment Criteria. Radials selected must meet specified lateral displacement limits
relating to extended runway centerlines. The final approach course should be aligned to intersect
the extended runway centerline at a point 3,000 feet from the threshold. When operationally
required, the course must lie within 500 feet laterally of the extended centerline at a point 3,000
feet outward from the runway threshold. As it is difficult to determine accurate crossover points
from drawings, use the following guidance to determine the crossover point, lateral displacement
of a radial, or determination of the optimum radial. It is paramount to ensure that engineering
maps accurately reflect the location of NAVAIDs (paragraph A4.11).
 182                                                       AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


Figure A4.5. Selecting Final Approach Radial (NAVAID past Threshold).




A4.6. Formula Symbology Definitions.
   A4.6.1. Angle a = The difference between the runway heading and final approach course
   stated in degrees.
   A4.6.2. T = Tangent of angle a.
   A4.6.3. D-1 = Lateral distance from a point on the runway centerline or extended centerline,
   stated in feet, measured perpendicularly to the facility, obtained from survey results or
   engineering maps.
   A4.6.4. D-2 = Distance in feet from a point on the runway centerline opposite the facility to
   the crossover point, derived from calculations explained below.
   A4.6.5. D-3 = Distance from a point on the runway centerline opposite the facility to runway
   threshold. This is a negative value when the facility is located past the threshold (Figure
   A4.5) and a positive value when the facility is located prior to the runway threshold (Figure
   A4.6). Obtain this measurement from actual survey or engineering map.
   A4.6.6. D-5 = The distance from the facility to a point 3,000 feet from the runway threshold
   is obtained by adding distance D-3 to 3,000 feet when D-3 is a negative value or by
   subtracting D-3 from 3,000 feet when D-3 is a positive value.
   A4.6.7. D-6 = The lateral displacement distance at 3,000 feet between the extended runway
   centerline and the final approach radial obtained by the following mathematical calculations.
A4.7. Determining the Final Approach Radial and the Runway Centerline Crossover Point
(Figure A4.5):
   A4.7.1. Step 1. Determine the distance between the facility and the runway centerline (D-1).
   A4.7.2. Step 2. Obtain the distance between the facility and the runway threshold (D-3).
   A4.7.3. Step 3. Determine the difference between the inbound heading of the extended
   runway centerline and the inbound heading of the final approach course radial (angle a).
   A4.7.4. Step 4. Convert angle a to a tangent.
   A4.7.5. Step 5. Divide distance D-1 by the tangent.
A4.8. Determining the Lateral Displacement of the Final Approach Radial at the Runway
Centerline 3,000 Feet from the Runway Threshold.
   A4.8.1. Step 1. Divide distance D-1 by the tangent of the angle a.
AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                     183


   A4.8.2. Step 2. Add distance D-3 to 3,000 feet to get distance D-5.
   A4.8.3. Step 3. Subtract distance D-5 from distance D-2.
   A4.8.4. Step 4. Multiply the result of Step 3 by the tangent of angle a. When the result of
   this step is 500 feet or less, the radial meets lateral displacement criteria. If it exceeds 500
   feet, consider selecting another radial or request a waiver.
A4.9. Selecting a Final Approach Radial. By using the following method, a final approach
radial can be selected that meets the lateral displacement criteria:
   A4.9.1. Step 1. Subtract 500 feet from distance D-1 (Figure A4.5).
   A4.9.2. Step 2. Divide the answer in Step 1 by distance D-5 to obtain the tangent of angle a.
   A4.9.3. Step 3. Convert the tangent of angle a to degrees. Round up to the next hundredth
   (.01) of a degree.
   A4.9.4. Step 4. When the flight path of the aircraft along the final approach course crosses
   the extended centerline from right to left as in Figure A4.5, subtract the results in Step 3 from
   the runway heading. When the aircraft crosses from left to right, add the results in Step 3. If
   the facility is located in front of the runway threshold as in Figure A4.6, subtract distance D-
   3 from 3,000 feet in Step 2. The remaining calculations are the same. Reducing the distance
   subtracted from distance D-1, in Step 1, the approach radial will move closer to the centerline
   at the 3,000 foot point. As an example, by subtracting 0 feet from D-1 in Step 1, a crossover
   point is established at 3,000 feet.

Section A4C–TERPS Techniques, Formulas and Distance Conversion Guidance

A4.10. Determining DME Arc Intercept Angles. Precision criteria specify a minimum length
of the intermediate segment based on the angle of intercept between the initial segment and the
localizer course. Use the formulas outlined in FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 3, Chapter 2, General
Criteria, to determine this angle.
A4.11. Determining Points on Maps and Charts. Since maps do not always accurately depict
the Airport Reference Point (ARP), NAVAIDs, fixes, or the locations of some man-made
obstacles, the instrument procedure designer must have the ability to manually plot geodetic
coordinates or determine the coordinates of a point depicted on a map. When using an
engineer’s scale to measure distances, the scale affording the greatest accuracy should be used.
The scale selected must then be used throughout the operation.
184                                                          AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


  A4.11.1. Plotting Known Geographical Coordinates. Instead of Degrees/Minutes/ Seconds,
  coordinates are sometimes recorded as Degrees/Decimal minutes. See Table A4.3 for
  conversion calculations. Example: Plot the ARP coordinates at Myrtle Beach International
  airport (N 33° 40' 47.10" W 078° 55' 42.00").
      A4.11.1.1. Step 1. Locate the latitude and longitude (Lat/Lon) grid rectangle that
      contains the coordinates to be plotted. Figure A4.7 depicts a 1:250,000 Joint Operations
      Graphic (JOG). Example: The MYR ARP coordinates are located within the rectangle N
      33° 30' 00" W 078° 45' 00" (lower right corner) to N 33° 45' 00" W 079° 00' 00" (upper
      left corner).
      A4.11.1.2. Step 2. Using an engineer’s scale, determine the number of seconds per
      “tick” of latitude and longitude on the scale map being used.
         A4.11.1.2.1. Latitude example.
             A4.11.1.2.1.1. Measure the distance between two latitudes that make the top and
             bottom sides of the rectangle determined in Step 1 with the 60 scale on an
             engineer’s scale. Our example uses N 33° 30' 00" and N 33° 45' 00".
             A4.11.1.2.1.2. The difference between N 33° 30' 00" and N 33° 45' 00" is 15'.
             Convert 15' to seconds by multiplying by 60 (15' × 60 = 900").
             A4.11.1.2.1.3. The measured distance between N 33° 30' 00" and N 33° 45' 00" is
             261 “ticks”.
             A4.11.1.2.1.4. 261 “ticks” divided by 900" = 0.29 “ticks” per seconds.
         A4.11.1.2.2. Longitude example.
             A4.11.1.2.2.1. Measure the distance between two longitudes that make the right
             and left sides of the rectangle determined in Step 1 with the 60 scale on an
             engineer’s scale. Our example uses N 78° 45' 00" and N 79° 00' 00".
             A4.11.1.2.2.2. The difference between N 78° 45' 00" and N 79° 00' 00" is 15'.
             Convert 15' to seconds by multiplying by 60 (15' × 60 = 900").
             A4.11.1.2.2.3. The measured distance between N 78° 45' 00" and N 79° 00' 00" is
             191 “ticks”.
             A4.11.1.2.2.4. 191 “ticks” divided by 900" = 0.21222 “ticks” per second.

      longitude of the target coordinate. Along this same longitude line, identify the working
      latitude close to the latitude of the target coordinate. Add or subtract this latitude value
      from the target latitude as appropriate. It is generally easier to select the working latitude
      that is less than the target latitude, but either way is acceptable.
         A4.11.1.3.1. Example 1. Working latitude selected is N 33° 40' 00.00". Determine
         the sum of the difference between the target latitude N 33° 40' 47.10" and the
         working latitude to determine the number of seconds difference.

        A4.11.1.3.2. Example 2. Working latitude selected in N 33° 41' 00.00". Determine
        the sum of the difference between the target latitude N 33° 40' 47.10" and the
        working latitude to determine the number of seconds difference.

Target Coordinates




       A4.11.1.4. Step 4. Determine the number of engineer scale “ticks” for the sum
       determined in Step 3. Measure this distance from the working latitude and mark with a
       working line perpendicular to the target longitude.
          A4.11.1.4.1. Example 1. 47.10" × 0.29 = 13.659 or 14 “ticks” north of N 33° 40'
          00".

         A4.11.1.4.2. Example 2. 12.90" × 0.29 = 3.741 or 4 “ticks” south of N 33° 41' 00".
     A4.11.1.5. Step 5. Figure A4.8. Add or subtract the working longitude value from the
     target longitude, as appropriate, in the same manner for longitude in Step 3. It is
     generally easier to select a working longitude that is less than the target longitude, but
     either way is acceptable.
         A4.11.1.5.1. Example 1. Working longitude selected is W 78° 55' 00.00".
         Determine the sum of the difference between the target longitude W 78° 55' 42.00"
         and the working longitude to determine the number of seconds difference.




         A4.11.1.5.2. Example 2. Working longitude selected in W 78° 56' 00.00".
         Determine the sum of the difference between the target longitude W 78° 55' 42.00"
         and the working longitude to determine the number of seconds difference.




     A4.11.1.6. Step 6. Determine the number of engineer scale “ticks” for the sum
     determined in Step 5.
         A4.11.1.6.1. Example 1. 42.00" × 0.2122 = 8.9124 or 9 “ticks” west of N 78° 55'
         00"
         A4.11.1.6.2. Example 2. 18.00" × 0.2122 = 3.8196 or 4 “ticks” east of N 78° 56' 00"
     A4.11.1.7. Step 7. Measure this distance from the target longitude and mark with a
     working line perpendicular to the latitude grid. Mark the intersection of the two working
     lines. This is the location of the target coordinates (ARP).
  A4.11.2. Determining Unknown Geographical Coordinates. The process for determining a
  set of coordinates for an object or point depicted on a map is the reverse of those steps for
  plotting known coordinates. Take Steps 1 and 2 as outlined in paragraph A4.11.1. Next
  draw two working lines through the point, first perpendicular to longitude, then perpendicular
  to latitude, making sure the lines are long enough to intersect the Lat/Lon grid. Determine
  the working latitude and longitude by finding the nearest hash mark from the points where
  the working lines intersect the Lat/Lon grid. Using an engineer’s scale, measure the number
  of “ticks” between the working lines and the working latitude or longitude. Divide the
  number of “ticks” by the seconds per “tick” values to determine the number of seconds the
  point is from the working latitude or longitude. Add or subtract as necessary the seconds
  from the working coordinates to determine the latitude and longitude.

      A4.17.1.1. Determine the climb-to-altitude where a standard CG can be resumed in this
      example by adding the required ROC to the height of the obstacle [ROC = 0.24 (CG ×
      d)].
         A4.17.1.1.1. Step 1. Calculate ROC: 0.24 (332 × 5.26) = 419.1168
         A4.17.1.1.2. Step 2. Add obstacle MSL elevation (including vertical accuracy) to
         ROC: 419.1168 + 1549 = 1968.1168
         A4.17.1.1.3. Step 3. Round 1968.1168 up to next 100-foot increment: 2000.
      A4.17.1.2. Publish the note “CAUTION: Missed Approach Climb Rate to 2000”
      above the minimum climb table.
      A4.17.1.3. Determine equivalent height by subtracting the amount of secondary rise at
      the obstacle measured from the edge of the primary area perpendicular to the missed
      approach course.

     A4.17.2.1. Determine the climb-to-altitude where a standard CG can be resumed in this
     example by adding the required ROC to the height of the obstacle [ROC = 0.24 (CG ×

         A4.17.2.1.1. Step 1. Calculate ROC: 0.24 (345 × 5.26) = 435.528
         A4.17.2.1.2. Step 2. Add obstacle MSL elevation (including vertical accuracy) to
         ROC: 435.528 + 1549 = 1984.528
         A4.17.2.1.3. Step 3. Round 1984.528 up to next 100-foot increment: 2000.
     A4.17.2.2. Publish the note “CAUTION: Missed Approach Climb Rate to 2000”
     above the minimum climb table.
     A4.17.2.3. Determine equivalent height by subtracting the amount of secondary rise at
     the obstacle measured from the edge of the primary area perpendicular to the missed
     approach course.

  8260.3 criteria are applied (excludes host nation or locations where the AF exercises TERPS
  authority when ICAO or NATO criteria are applied). Note: When required, apply in
  CONUS and annotate the approach “NOT FOR CIVIL USE.”
     A4.17.3.1. CAT I precision instrument procedures (applicable only to Section 2). For
     Section 1 penetrations, only DA adjustments are authorized.
         A4.17.3.1.1. Apply the applicable Section 2 missed approach (straight, turning or
         combination straight and turning) criteria from FAA Order 8260.3, Volume 3,
         Chapter 3. Calculate the climb gradient using the following formula:




         A4.17.3.1.2. Calculate the climb-to-altitude (CTA) by using the following formula:
198                                                      AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


                           CTA = (D × CG) + DA

         A4.17.3.1.3. Round this result to the higher 100-foot value and publish the rounded
         value as the altitude where the standard climb rate (200 ft/NM) can be resumed (see
         example note in A4.17.2.2).
      A4.17.3.2. Nonprecision instrument approach procedures.
         A4.17.3.2.1. Apply the applicable missed approach criteria from FAA Order 8260.3,
         Volume 1, Chapter 2, to determine the amount of penetration of the MA surface, in
         feet.
         A4.17.3.2.2. Divide the amount of penetration by the NM distance ‘D’ from the OCS
         calculations. The resultant value is equal to the difference between the standard OCS
         and the OCS required to clear the penetrating obstacle.
         A4.17.3.2.3. Add 200 to the result of A4.17.3.2.2 and round up to the next 1-foot
         increment. The resultant value equals the minimum publishable CG to clear the
         obstruction with the required ROC.
         A4.17.3.2.4. Calculate the climb-to-altitude by multiplying the published CG from
         paragraph A4.17.3.2.3 by the NM distance ‘D’ determined in paragraph A4.17.3.2.2.
         Add the MDA to the result. Round this result to the higher 100-foot value and
         publish the rounded value as the altitude where the standard climb rate (200 ft/NM)
         can be resumed (see example note in paragraph A4.17.2.2).

        INSTRUMENT PROCEDURE FLYABILITY CHECK INSTRUCTIONS

A7.1. Purpose of Flyability Checks and Documentation Requirements. Instrument
procedure flyability checks are flown to ensure instrument procedures are safe, practical, and
consistent with good operating procedures. They shall include all segments of the instrument
procedure including the missed approach segment and all holding patterns. Flyability checks are
documented on AF IMT 3992 or AF IMT 3993 as appropriate. Instrument procedure designer
concerns documented on the flyability check IMT should be reviewed before the flyability check
is flown. Aircrews shall complete the applicable flyability check IMT (see examples at Figure
A7.1, Figure A7.2, and Figure A7.3) and sign. Aircrew comments should be written in the
remarks section. Flyability checks are not official flight inspections. Whenever possible, the
pilot performing the check should personally debrief the instrument procedure designer
responsible for the procedure. Maintain these IMTs with the TERPS procedure package (Table
2.1). See paragraph 3.17 for additional guidance when requesting flyability checks at host
nation locations.
   A7.1.1. All flyability checks should determine whether the procedure is flyable and safe for
   a current and qualified pilot flying an aircraft equipped with basic IFR instrumentation under
   instrument meteorological conditions. Flyability checks do not require any special crew
   qualification or certification unless directed by the flight crew’s MAJCOM.
   A7.1.2. Flyability checks shall be flown under day VMC. The MAJCOM A3 or a formally
   designated representative may approve flyability checks at night after ORM considerations
   when needed to meet mission requirements. While conducting the flyability check, the crew
   must be vigilant for obstructions, especially those not depicted that could be hazardous. The
   flyability check should carefully evaluate the final approach course alignment (“desired
   aiming point”) - the pilot should be able to maneuver the aircraft safely from the missed
   approach point to touchdown.
   A7.1.3. Pilots conducting flyability checks at host nation airfields may find it difficult to
   evaluate the entire procedure. They should be able to assess the probability of satisfactory
   NAVAID and radio reception, and obstacle and terrain clearance for portions of the
   instrument procedure that cannot be flown. For example, when the missed approach segment
   cannot be flown on arrival, an assessment may be made when departing.
   A7.1.4. When a flyability check cannot be completed (NAVAID not available or
   commissioned, lack of locally assigned aircraft to perform the flyability check, etc.) prior to
   flight inspection, satisfactory completion of a commissioning flight inspection may be
   substituted for the flyability check requirement. When completed during the flight
   inspection, ensure the flight inspection pilot addresses any flyability check considerations on
   the flight inspection report. Note: AF IMT 3992 or AF IMT 3993 is not required in this
   instance.
   A7.1.5. When runway markings or course alignment are questionable, request particular
   attention be given to those aspects of the procedure during the flyability check, and annotate
   results on AF IMT 3992 or AF IMT 3993.
 202                                                        AFI11-230 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


   A7.1.6. The pilot conducting the flyability check should simulate the most restrictive aircraft
   category and must evaluate the entire procedure. The procedure is acceptable when the pilot
   conducting this check determines:
       A7.1.6.1. The procedure is operationally sound and required aircraft maneuvering is
       consistent with good operating practices.
       A7.1.6.2. Cockpit workload is acceptable for a low time pilot with minimal IFR/IMC
       experience.
       A7.1.6.3. Charts can be easily interpreted and contain proper information.
       A7.1.6.4. The procedure ensures safety of flight using the guidance in AFMAN 11-217
       or as explained in the procedure.
A7.2. Human Factors. Aircrews should consider the following items when conducting the
flyability check:
   A7.2.1. Complexity. The procedure should be as simple as possible; it should not impose
   excessive cockpit workload.
   A7.2.2. Interpretability. The NAVAID that provides information for the final approach
   course should be clearly identified. Be aware of NAVAIDs located on or near the final
   approach course that are not part of the final approach segment; they are often subject to
   being misinterpreted as part of the IAP. The depicted procedure should clearly indicate to
   which runway(s) a circling approach can be made, and what areas, if any, cannot be used
   during the circling maneuver.
   A7.2.3. Memory Considerations. An aeronautical chart is a storehouse of information. The
   aircrew must be able to extract information quickly and accurately, so evaluate whether
   essential data can be quickly and easily found and deciphered.
