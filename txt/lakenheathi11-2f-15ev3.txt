8. Preflight Planning. The pilot in command will ensure each aircrew member has been
briefed on these additional items prior to flight:
   8.1. UK Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs).
       8.1.1. At a minimum, the following NOTAMs will be reviewed prior to flying in the UK:
       Aerodrome NOTAMs, London and Scottish Visual Flight Rules (VFR) area NOTAMs,
       and Low Fly NOTAMs (if low fly is planned).
       8.1.2. When planning to low fly, aircrew will ensure they are in possession of the most
       current Civil Aviation Notification Procedure (CANP) prior to flight. The CANP and
       low fly booking numbers will be carried by each aircraft. If the CANP number briefed
       by the Low Fly Booking Cell at time of booking does not match the posted CANP, crews
       will not enter the low fly system until they have reviewed the most current CANP. Any
       changes/re-booking of low fly will require confirmation and possession of the latest
       CANP prior to low flying.
   8.2. Pipeline Inspection Notification System.
   8.3. Bird Activity. Available information regarding bird activity, to include: the UK
   Military Aeronautical Information Planning Document (UK Mil AIP), Volume 3, Part 1, UK
   Low Flying Section; UK Mil AIP CD; UK low fly NOTAMs that mention bird activity: and
   the local bird watch condition as defined by 48 FW Plan 91-212, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard
   (BASH) Plan.
   8.4. Snow NOTAMs (SNOWTAMs).
   8.5. Mission Data Cards. Each squadron will develop mission data cards for use in their
   squadron. The mission data card will contain at a minimum the following information:
   flight call sign, Joker/Bingo fuels, flight discrete frequency, and takeoff and landing data for
   the aircraft configuration IAW AFI 11-2F-15 Volume 3 or AFI 11-2F-15E Volume 3.
   8.6. Fini-flights. Aircrew on fini-flights will plan and fly missions that include elements
   based on the unit’s current training program. Aircrew will not introduce new missions or
   mission elements unique to the fini-flight and will inform the Operations Supervisor (Ops
   Sup) of the mission profile.
   8.7. (E) Personal item storage. On missions requiring personal luggage where travel pods
   are not authorized or available, aircrew will primarily use the Video Tape Recorder (VTR)
   compartment (door 47L) and Conformal Fuel Tank gun compartment (door 570, ensuring
   doors 41 and 42 are closed). Additionally, aircrew can utilize 47R and 155L/R on the bottom
   of the fuselage when qualified maintenance personnel are available at the destination.
   Aircrew will ―info note‖ in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
   Document, when personal items are stored in these locations. AFTO Form 781A is
   prescribed by TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation,
   Policies, And Procedures.
9. Flight Plans.
   9.1. Local stereo flight plans are listed in LAKENHEATHI 13-201. To reduce delays in
   coordination with London Air Traffic Control Center Military (London Mil), Squadron
   Operations will notify 48 OSS/OSAA immediately upon flight plan changes (i.e.,
   stereo/route changes, departure times, duration, number in flight).
 6                                            LAKENHEATHI11-2F-15-EV3 26 MARCH 2009


     9.2. During surge operations, aircrew must ensure requested flight plan is submitted as soon
     as possible after landing to ensure enough time to enter the flight plan into the system.
     9.3. Flight leads will ensure that the USAFE Base Form 32, Commander's Narrative, is
     completed for all local sorties. These records will be maintained for one year then discarded.
     9.4. Flights requiring a controlled takeoff time should contact ground control with request
     when calling for taxi.
10. Fuel Requirements and Bingo Fuels. Flight leads will plan Bingo fuel based on forecast
weather to recover with divert fuel required by AFI 11-202 Volume 3 and AFI 11-202 Volume 3
USAFE Supplement for the designated alternate.
     10.1. When an alternate is not required, aircrew will plan on arriving at the Final Approach
     Fix (FAF) or Initial with AFI 11-2F-15 Volume 3 or AFI 11-2F-15E Volume 3 fuels (F-15C:
     2,000 pounds, F-15E: 2,500 pounds). For nighttime operations, all aircraft will arrive with
     3,500 pounds at the FAF.
     10.2. Flight leads will direct a specific Joker and Bingo fuel prior to takeoff.
     10.3. If an aircraft reaches 1,000 pounds after landing, aircrew will closely monitor feed tank
     fuel quantities, communicate their fuel state to the Ops Sup, consider shutting down the left
     engine, and formulate a plan with the Ops Sup to get priority in the End of Runway (EOR)
     for taxi back to the hot pits or chocks. At 800 pounds, aircrew will shut down the left engine,
     and if not approaching the parking area, shut down the aircraft at the present position and
     have the aircraft towed to park.
11. Starting Procedures.
     11.1. Flight leads will inform Squadron Operations of any flight changes (maintenance
     delays or tail number changes). If unable to contact Squadron Operations, pertinent
     information may be passed through the SOF (call sign ―Ramrod‖) before takeoff.
     11.2. The nose gear pin streamer should be secured to the drag brace before engine start.
     Landing gear pins will not be removed until after the first engine is started. After start of the
     first engine, the aircrew will verify that the crew chief has removed the nose gear pin prior to
     starting the second engine.
     11.3. If trained Arm/De-arm crews are available, all ordnance pins will remain installed for
     taxi and will be removed in the arming area. Captive Air Training Missiles may be armed or
     de-armed in the chocks.
     11.4. In a Protective Aircraft Shelter (PAS), aircrew will ensure that all shelter doors are
     open prior to starting engines. Secure items inside the shelter to reduce the Foreign Object
     Damage (FOD) hazard during engine operations. In addition, aircrew will conduct a FOD
     inspection in the PAS and on the parking apron in front of the PAS prior to engine start.
     11.5. Verify a fireguard is manning a fire bottle and positioned near the aircraft for all
     engine starts.
     11.6. When shutting down an engine for Crypto re-key, hot pit refueling, or aircraft
     maintenance in the vicinity of the inlet ramp, place the ramp switch to emergency.

   11.7. When carrying chaff or flares, Countermeasures Dispenser (CMD) built-in test checks
   will not be accomplished in the PAS, in the vicinity of personnel, or anywhere an inadvertent
   flare actuation could create a significant hazard.
12. Taxiing, Arming, and De-Arming.
   12.1. Taxi on the centerline and maintain 300-foot spacing at RAF Lakenheath. Taxi
   direction in all hardened aircraft parking areas and loops will be clockwise; taxi direction on
   the Alpha and Charlie ramps will be counter-clockwise unless ―back taxi‖ is approved by
   control In Accordance With (IAW) LAKENHEATHI 13-201.
   12.2. Minimum RWY condition reading for taxi is 12.
   12.3. Maximum taxi speed is 25 knots ground speed; use 15 knots ground speed maximum
   in congested areas. Turns will be made in IDLE.
   12.4. Aircraft will take the first available arming spot flowing from the taxiway. Exit the
   arming area by turning towards the runway (RWY). Aircraft with live forward-firing
   missiles or rockets will arm in the G and K loops pointed at the berm. If unavailable or
   unsuitable for operational reasons, use the south arming area for RWY 24.
   12.5. IAW TO 1F-15C-34-1-3CL-1, Flight Crew Nonnuclear Weapon Delivery Checklist
   (Air-to-Air); and TO 1F-15E-34-1-1CL-1, Flight Crew Nonnuclear Weapon Delivery
   Checklist, aircrew will ensure all armament and CMD switches are in the Off, Safe, or
   Normal position and have their hands in a position visible to the arm/de-arm crew during
   arming and de-arming operations.
   12.6. Each flight member will visually confirm configuration and absence of all streamers,
   for their formation’s aircraft after arming procedures have been completed.
   12.7. Reference LAKENHEATHI 13-201, all flights will notify Ground Control when they
   are ―10 minutes prior‖ to takeoff. At this time, notify Ground Control if a formation takeoff
   is planned.
   12.8. Flight leads will remain on ground frequency until receiving their squawk. All flight
   members will acknowledge upon receipt.
   12.9. Before takeoff, flight leads will contact Ops Sup or Duty Desk Officer for final words
   prior to changing the flight to discrete frequency.
   12.10. Aircraft with expendables or carted stations will de-arm prior to taxiing to parking.
   12.11. Aircraft will monitor Ground Control immediately upon exiting the RWY.
   12.12. Take the first available de-arm spot exiting the RWY. Notify Ground Control ―call
   sign, de-arm to (parking location, i.e., PAS 20 or Alpha Ramp)‖ or ―de-arm to hot pits‖ prior
   to pulling out of spot. Exit de-arm area by turning toward taxiway.
   12.13. Hot pit refueling will not be conducted if any fuel system abnormality is suspected.
   Intentional in-flight fuel dumping is not an abnormality, but aircrew must ensure dump valve
   has closed by observing fuel flow from dump mast stops and notify hot pit crew prior to hot
   pit refueling.

     attitude platform must be operational for night or Instrument Meteorological Conditions
     (IMC).
     14.2. Aircrew will ensure a recording medium is used on all flights (8-millimeter tape or
     digital video recorder). Authorized exceptions include cross-country, air show or fly-by,
     incentive and ferry flights.
     14.3. Aircraft flying at night must have both wingtip position lights, both anti-collision
     beacons on the wing roots, and either the anti-collision beacon on the right vertical stab or
     the left vertical stab white light.
     14.4. All aircrew are required to have flight coverall sleeves rolled down to the wrist and
     flight gloves on, to the maximum extent possible, while performing flight duties in the
     aircraft.
15. Takeoff Procedures.
     15.1. Minimum weather for takeoff will be 300-foot ceiling and 1,600-meter visibility or
     pilot weather category, whichever is higher.
     15.2. When cleared for an ―immediate‖ takeoff, pilots will execute a rolling takeoff. If this
     clearance cannot be accepted, notify Tower and remain clear of the RWY.
     15.3. Prior to releasing brakes, notify Departure Control with ―call sign, rolling,
     Deconfliction/Traffic Service.‖
     15.4. Prior to takeoff, the flight lead will visually or verbally confirm that each aircraft in
     their flight has been armed and that before takeoff checks were accomplished.
     15.5. Do not perform rolling formation takeoffs.
     15.6. Terminate afterburner at 300 Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS) if not carrying heavy
     weight or performing an unrestricted climb.
     15.7. Maximum performance takeoffs will not be made at RAF Lakenheath, or off station,
     except for FCF and incentive flights. Additional exceptions require 48 OG/CC approval for
     local takeoffs, or squadron commander approval when off station. Weather required for
     maximum performance takeoffs is 2,000 feet and 5,000 meters visibility with the ability to
     recover in Visual Meteorological Conditions. Accelerate to achieve 400 KIAS climbing to
     500 feet Above Ground Level (AGL) no later than 1 Nautical Mile (NM) past the departure
LAKENHEATHI11-2F-15-EV3 26 MARCH 2009                                                            9


   end of the RWY. At 400 KIAS pull no greater than 5g’s vertically until reaching 45-80
   degrees nose high. Lead and level off at the assigned altitude.
   15.8. If three or more aircraft depart in trail, the last aircraft will also squawk the flight’s
   assigned Mode 3, Mode S, and Mode C code.
16. Low Fly Restrictions.
   16.1. Aircrew will not low fly in Low Flying Area (LFA) 5 (Night LFA 5A), unless no other
   low flying area is available (due to weather or fuel considerations). Exception: low-level
   departures. If low fly in LFA 5 is planned, the flight lead will notify the Ops Sup. The Ops
   Sup will notify the 48 FW RAF Commander’s office.
   16.2. All aircrew will avoid the National Bird of Prey Centre outside Ross-on-Wye at
   position: N51-54.8 and W002-25.65, NR01 in Low Fly 4, by 3 NM and 2,000 feet AGL.
   Note: UK Low Flying Handbook (UK LFH) restrictions and chart depictions are 1 NM and
   1,000 feet AGL.
   16.3. Due to heavy traffic density at Manston Civil Aerodrome, N51 20.53 E001 20.80 (CA
   07, LFA 18), aircrew will use extra vigilance when low flying near the aerodrome. Aircrew
   should avoid encroaching on the East/West approach and departure corridors. Note: The
   UK LFH restrictions and chart depictions are 2 NM and 2,000 feet AGL. At peak times,
   however, their traffic density warrants a larger avoidance.
17. Additional Restrictions.
   17.1. General Handling will not be accomplished within 6 NM of Norwich, N52-38.3 E001-
   18.5. The intent is to allow over flight to and from local airspace, and minimize the noise
   signature.
   17.2. During incentive, orientation and familiarization flights, aircraft will not perform
   aerobatics within a 5 NM radius of RAF Lakenheath or any other airfields or built up areas.
   17.3. Do not accomplish practice diversions to civil airports or use the services of civil
   agencies that charge a fee. Ensure a no-fee approach and/or service for civil radar service.
   17.4. To avoid conflicts with the Clacton/Terminal East Airspace, aircrew will not conduct
   General Handling in East Anglia south of the East Anglian Military Temporary Reserve
   Airspace (MTRA) border.
   17.5. 48 FW aircraft will be configured to receive on Narrow Band (NB) to prevent
   unwanted reception of nearby frequencies, due to the frequency allocation in North Atlantic
   Treaty Organization. The NB setting only affects reception, as transmission is always NB.
   17.6. Aircrew will minimize tactical maneuvering in East Anglia between 2000 feet AGL
   and 5000 feet AGL for noise abatement. If weather or airspace constraints require the use of
   this airspace, aircrew will not operate extensively in the same location.
   17.7. Aircrew operating within UK airspace are permitted to interrogate Mode 4 only during:
   system checks, A/A missions consisting of 2 versus 1 or greater, and HHQ exercises within
   UK airspace regardless of mission type. Mode 4 interrogations are not allowed in UK
   controlled airspace or within Class D and E airspace.
 10                                         LAKENHEATHI11-2F-15-EV3 26 MARCH 2009


   17.8. Cockpit media restrictions.
       17.8.1. IAW Headquarters United States Air Forces in Europe Directorate of Air and
       Space Operations (HQ USAFE/A3) guidance, only 48 FW aircrew, unit-assigned
       intelligence, flight surgeon and USAFE Rangeless Instrumentation Training System
       (URITS)/Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) contractor personnel may
       view cockpit media from 48 FW aircraft. This restriction includes Multi Functional
       Display (MFD)/Heads Up Display (HUD) tapes, cockpit recordings, digital cartridges,
       etc.
       17.8.2. Waiver authority for this restriction is the 48 FW Commander (48 FW/CC).
       17.8.3. Personnel approved to view cockpit media will only share media or tapes from
       their respective Mission Design Series (MDS) aircraft with personnel from another MDS
       aircraft after having received 48 FW/CC approval obtained and documented through 48
       FW Advanced Programs (48 FW/AP). 48 FW F-15C/D aircrew and intelligence
       personnel, and 48 FW F-15E aircrew and intelligence personnel are approved to share
       cockpit media using existing 48 FW/AP security restriction and procedures.
       17.8.4. Visiting aircrew and intelligence personnel will coordinate with 48 FW/AP for
       waiver approval prior to viewing 48 FW cockpit media. This does not include aircrew
       from other wings qualified in the same MDS aircraft as the host unit. Existing 48 FW/AP
       security restrictions and procedures will be followed when visiting aircrew view 48 FW
       cockpit media and documented by 48 FW/AP.
18. Supersonic Flight. In order to prevent inadvertent supersonic events, 48 FW aircrew will
not exceed .92 Mach (M) in any area not authorized for supersonic flight. Aircrew will reference
the following rules covering supersonic flight from Joint Services Publication (JSP) 550,
Military Aviation Policy, Regulations And Directives, Regulation 310; UK Mil AIP En Route;
and from Flight Information Publication AP/2, Area Planning - Europe, Africa, Middle East.
   18.1. IAW UK Flight Information Region/Upper Information Region (FIR/UIR), all medium
   and high level supersonic flights are to be made over the sea. Aircraft heading directly out to
   sea may accelerate to supersonic speed when at least 10 NM out to sea and along a line of
   flight at least 20 degrees divergent from the mean line of the coast; the angle of dive is not to
   exceed the minimum necessary to accelerate to supersonic flight. Supersonic flights with the
   aircraft pointing towards the land, turning or flying parallel to the coast are to take place at
   least 35 NM from the nearest coast line.
   18.2. Supersonic flights at low level over the sea within the UK FIR are authorized (see
   paragraph 18.1.) In addition; maintain a radar/visual search to avoid the following:
       18.2.1. Shipping and fixed or mobile oil and gas installations: 3 NM.
       18.2.2. Civilian or military transport aircraft: 6 NM.
       18.2.3. Helicopters, helicopter main routes and corridors: 6 NM.
       18.2.4. If not on a routine Air Defense training mission, aircrew must notify the
       controlling agency of planned supersonic flight (e.g., FCF flights).
   18.3. The Ops Sup or Standby Duty Officer (SDO) will notify the appropriate Control and
   Reporting Centre or Control and Reporting Point, Senior Military Supervisor at London Mil,
LAKENHEATHI11-2F-15-EV3 26 MARCH 2009                                                          11


   or Naval Radar Unit of any inadvertent supersonic flight within 30 minutes of the aircraft’s
   landing. Exceeding .92 M overland does not require this report; however, aircrew will notify
   the Ops Sup and follow the procedures for reporting breaches of airspace or speed
   restrictions (paragraph 19.1.)
19. Reporting of Breaches of Airspace or Speed Restrictions.
   19.1. Any time a potential breach of the UK airspeed restrictions, controlled airspace, or low
   fly rules occurs or is suspected, notify the squadron Director of Operations (DO), Ops Sup, or
   the SDO. Annotate the position, time, heading, airspace, altitude and attitude of the
   occurrence on the USAFE Base Form 32. Ops Sups or SDOs will notify 48 OSS Current
   Operations (48 OSS/OSO, 226-2399) as soon as possible after being informed of the event.
   19.2. If contacted by a Defence Flying Complaints Investigation Team (DFCIT) investigator
   about a potential breach, cooperate and ensure the squadron DO and 48 OSS/OSO are aware
   an investigation is being conducted. DFCIT should coordinate with Third Air Force and 48
   OSS/OSO prior to contacting an individual in a flying squadron.
20. A/A Refueling.
   20.1. For fuels accounting purposes, the following information needs to be annotated in the
   aircraft AFTO Form 781A.
      20.1.1. Tanker call sign, home station, country of origin, and the offload received. Note:
      This information may be garnered from the tanker’s tail flash or fuselage markings, or by
      a radio call (if the situation allows).
      20.1.2. Any disparity between the amount that is given by the boom operator (if
      applicable) and the fuel gauge reading should be reported during debrief.
   20.2. Mission Qualification Training aircrew will not perform A/A refueling single-ship,
   unless a squadron supervisor or instructor is in the aircraft.
21. Recovery.
   21.1. On recovery (when within radio range of RAF Lakenheath), aircrew will contact
   Operations to pass codes and get updates to any significant events including weather that
   may impact recovery.
   21.2. Flight leads (primarily) and formation members (to the maximum extent possible) will
   clear with A/G radar on recovery in IMC and attempt to minimize the flight’s exposure in the
   freezing level +/-3,000 feet.
   21.3. Eagle Trail Recoveries. The 48 FW does not possess any Letters of Agreement for
   Radar trail recoveries at any airfield other than RAF Lakenheath.
   21.4. Trail recoveries should be flown via an instrument or a diverse penetration established
   in trail prior to penetration.
   21.5. If spacing was not established prior to the penetration, flight leads should direct each
   flight member to execute a briefed Drag Maneuver in sufficient time to ensure required
   spacing is obtained prior to the final approach fix. If not briefed otherwise, wingmen will set
   72 percent RPM and slow to 240 KIAS until spacing achieved.
   21.6. Spacing for trail recoveries will be 1.5 to 2 miles.
 12                                          LAKENHEATHI11-2F-15-EV3 26 MARCH 2009


   21.7. If three or more aircraft arrive in trail formation to RAF Lakenheath, the last aircraft
   will also squawk the flight’s assigned Mode 3 and Mode C beacon code. The last aircraft
   will begin squawking when told to contact RAF Lakenheath Approach by London Mil or
   when assigned a code from Lakenheath Radar Approach Control during a free call.
   21.8. If flight lead goes missed approach, wingmen will continue the approach unless
   directed to climb out.
   21.9. If the flight lead directs a climb out, the flight will follow trail departure procedures.
22. Local Pattern Procedures.
   22.1. Aircraft executing a low approach behind a full stop will avoid over flight of aircraft
   on the RWY by offsetting the RWY to the north after the landing gear is retracted.
   22.2. Closed patterns on RWY 24 will be executed so as to avoid over flying the base
   hospital, commissary, schools, and housing. Aircrew desiring to re-enter at point Delta will
   avoid over flying the base by continuing straight ahead until past base housing and turn to be
   inside or over the canal that is between RAF Mildenhall and RAF Lakenheath. Do not
   extend into RAF Mildenhall’s airspace.
   22.3. Pilots must request and be granted permission for an early turn out to point Delta. This
   turn must be executed above 500 feet AGL and not later than abeam the tower. Remain
   below 1,000 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL) until clear of inside downwind.
   22.4. Closed patterns on RWY 06 will be executed prior to the airfield boundary (A1065). If
   unable, pilots will reenter at point Bravo. Avoid Brandon during the turn to Bravo.
   22.5. Do not fly simulated single engine overheads.
   22.6. Aircraft escorting an emergency aircraft will offset to the north side of the RWY (if
   able) on low approach.
   22.7. Standard RADAR climbout procedures are as follows: Maintain at or below 1,000 feet
   MSL until departure end, then as follows:
      22.7.1. For RWY 24: at 1 DME, turn right to 360 degrees and climb to 3,000 feet MSL.
      22.7.2. For RWY 06: turn right to 070 degrees and climb to 3,000 feet MSL, at 4 DME,
      turn left to 310 degrees. 30 degree bank turns are mandatory for noise abatement.
23. Landing Procedures. Any reference to the ―Cold‖ side of the RWY is directed to the side
where De-Arm/EOR activities will normally be conducted. The ―Hot‖ side will be the opposite
of the ―Cold‖ side.
   23.1. When conditions allow, align aircraft with the center of the RWY for landing.
   Considerations should be given to factors affecting landing, e.g., crosswind components,
   wind shear, vortices, and spacing behind other aircraft.
   23.2. When utilizing reduced separation behind similar aircraft (F-15C/D and F-15E are
   considered similar aircraft for reduced separation), ensure proper distance and offset are
   included in the landing decision. Pilots should use alternate side landing to comply with
   LAKENHEATHI 13-201 reduced RWY separation. Conditions permitting, offset should be
   approximately equal to placing a main gear on the centerline of the RWY. Clear the aircraft
   to the ―Cold‖ side of the RWY, once the aircraft is safely under control. Clear far enough
LAKENHEATHI11-2F-15-EV3 26 MARCH 2009                                                           13


   ―Cold‖ to ensure wingtip clearance for any aircraft that may have to pass on the RWY
   centerline. Aircraft landing in sequence on the ―Cold‖ side will turn landing light off to
   signal under control and nose tail clearance meets 300 feet spacing requirement.
   23.3. Every attempt should be made to safely slow aircraft to a safe taxi speed prior to the
   last cable and prior to departing the porous friction surface. If not decelerating sufficiently,
   remain on or cross to the ―Hot‖ side to de-conflict from slower aircraft. The ―Hot‖ side
   should be used if necessary to pass other aircraft on the RWY and/or to prepare for cable
   engagement.
   23.4. If reduced braking action is experienced, aircrew will notify the Tower as soon as
   possible. Use GOOD, FAIR, POOR, or NIL to describe the braking action experienced
   during rollout. Expect Tower to increase RWY separation requirements between aircraft.
   23.5. Formation landings are only authorized if the RWY condition is ―DRY/DRY‖ or
   ―WET/DRY.‖
   23.6. Due to deteriorating RWY conditions it is possible for the porous friction surface to
   remain WET, while the concrete surface on each end is reported DRY. In this case, for a
   RWY which is reported DRY/WET use the WET/WET restrictions.
24. Radar Service.
   24.1. To the maximum extent possible, flights will be under Deconfliction Service prior to
   entering Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC).
   24.2. Without prior permission from the Ministry of Defence, all flights on weekends will be
   under Traffic Service as a minimum.
   24.3. Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) approaches are referred to as Surveillance Radar
   Approach at UK controlled bases. ASR procedures at these bases are different from those
   encountered in the United States. Upon reaching the descent point, the pilot establishes the
   published glide path and the controllers give recommended altitudes every 0.5 NM. At RAF
   bases, controllers giving an ASR approach compute the missed approach point as a
   triangulation of the minimum descent altitude and the glide path. If Pilot Weather Category
   minimums are higher than the published approach minimums, advise the controller so that a
   new missed approach point can be computed.
   24.4. Trail Formations of greater than 1 NM are referred to as ―Stream Formations‖ in the
   UK. IAW UK MIL AIP En Route procedures, if a stream extends beyond 3 NM, the last
   aircraft should squawk the same as the flight lead, unless directed otherwise.
25. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Policy.
   25.1. For re-currency, the 48 OG/CC is the approval authority to select NVG instructors and
   squadron supervisors to be considered current upon completion of refresher NVG academics.
   All other NVG qualified but non-current aircrew will regain NVG Demanding Mission
   currency IAW AFI 11-2F-15 Volume 1, F-15 – Aircrew Training; or AFI 11-2F-15E Volume
   1, F-15E – Aircrew Training.
   25.2. Flight leads will ensure NVG integration is briefed on sorties when NVGs are planned
   to be used. As a minimum, topics will cover the additional task prioritization concerns while
   flying with NVGs, visual illusions, spatial disorientation, and night safety issues.
 14                                         LAKENHEATHI11-2F-15-EV3 26 MARCH 2009


   25.3. If there is an instructor or squadron supervisor in the formation, 48 FW aircrew may
   transition from Low Illumination (LI) training rules (TRs) to HI TRs IAW AFI 11-214, Air
   Operations Rules and Procedures. An in-flight switch requires LI and HI TRs be planned
   and briefed. Prior to operating below MSA and before a change to the illumination level, all
   aircraft in the formation must acknowledge the new illumination level over the radio. All
   aircrew will maintain vigilance in such scenarios and transition to LI TRs if conditions
   deteriorate.
   25.4. MDS specific NVG policies:
      25.4.1. (E) Aircrew will not fly below MSA with NVGs, unless on a designated NVG
      syllabus sortie or have completed the entire NVG syllabus and been certified by the
      SQ/CC.
      25.4.2. (E) When flying below MSA, aircrew will use Terrain Following (TF) as a
      complimentary system to the maximum extent possible. During periods of HI
      illumination, aircrew will ensure they are above 1,000 feet AGL and verbalize inter-
      cockpit ―above 1,000 feet‖ prior to maneuvering outside TF limits when below MSA.
      25.4.3. (C) Aircrew will not operate below MSA at night.
26. Reduced Lighting and Lights Out Operations. Authorized IAW AFI 11-214, AFI 11-202
Volume 3 USAFE Supplement, and UK rules found in JSP 550, Section 300, which states the
following:
   26.1. Aircrew must plan to use host nation Ground Controlled Intercept (GCI) or Airborne
   Warning and Control System (AWACS) during reduced lighting (anti-collision lights off
   with any setting of position lights) or blacked out (all lights off) missions at night in non-
   special use airspace (e.g., WASH Aerial Tactics Area (ATA), Lakenheath (LAK) ATA,
   WALES Military Training Area (MTA), East Anglian MTRA, etc.)
   26.2. If Ground Controlled Intercept (GCI) or Airborne Warning and Control System
   (AWACS) is not possible in non-special use airspace, then, the airspace may be segregated
   by Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) one week in advance via coordination between squadron
   operations and the UK Airspace Utilization System (AUS). If NOTAM’d, military Air
   Traffic Control (ATC) is sufficient as a monitoring agency when under Traffic Service,
   Deconfliction Service or Radar Control. Squadron operations will fax the NOTAM to UK
   AUS at 020-7453-6593 and include the following information:
      26.2.1. Type of operation (e.g., reduced lighting or blacked out training).
      26.2.2. Date.
      26.2.3. Time.
      26.2.4. Location (e.g., WASH ATA, LAK ATA, or latitude and longitude description of
      area to be used).
      26.2.5. Vertical limits (e.g., altitudes to be used).
      26.2.6. Type and number of aircraft.
      26.2.7. Point of contact (e.g., fighter squadron operations with telephone number).
LAKENHEATHI11-2F-15-EV3 26 MARCH 2009                                                            15


      26.2.8. If using Danger areas (e.g., EGD323, etc.) pre-coordinated with Combined Air
      Operations Center 9, then military ATC is sufficient as a monitoring agency.
      26.2.9. If using UK low fly areas out to 3 NM over water, operations will be directly
      IAW the UK Mil AIP, Volume 3 Part 1, UK Low Flying (UK Low Fly Handbook).
27. Gun Procedures. Except for planned gun employment missions, the gun will be safe/cold.
Refer to AFI 11-214 for hot gun procedures.
   27.1. Do not accomplish systems checks closer than 5,000 feet with a hot gun.
   27.2. Low Angle Strafe will be accomplished IAW the F-15E Standard Strafe Card, accessible on the
   17th Weapons Squadron (17 WPS) website https://wwwmil.nellis.af.mil/units/usafws/17WPS.htm.
   In training execution, the intent is to not recover below 500 feet Above Ground Level (AGL).
   27.3. In training, ensure Low Rate of fire is selected in the Programmable Armament
   Control Set (PACS) prior to gun employment.
28. Simulated Gun Employment. Accomplish a trigger check IAW AFTTP 3-3.MDS on all
safe/cold gun sorties where gun employment in the training mode is anticipated. Record the
trigger check.
29. UK Restrictions.
   29.1. The WASH and LAK ATAs are used predominantly for pre-planned upgrade or
   continuation training missions. Aircrew will refrain from implementing Allied Command
   Europe (ACE) Manual 75-2-1, ―Fighting Edge‖ Target of Opportunity Air-to-Air Training
   Rules, within these areas.
   29.2. In the UK, the use of electronic jamming, chaff and flares is prohibited unless over
   water, or coordinated with a radar service. Do not use chaff in the Lakenheath (LAK) or
   WASH Aerial Training Area (ATA) if the forecast or observed winds are between 030
   degrees and 130 degrees in the LAK ATA, between 310 degrees and 130 degrees in the
   WASH ATA, or in any case where chaff may drift over land. Jamming and chaff are
   authorized on Spadeadam range and IAW UK Range Orders.
   29.3. Use of flares over water is prohibited at night, unless Her Majesty’s (HM) Coastguard
   is notified in advance. If operating on a controlled range, notify the range officer at least 1
   hour in advance. The range officer will notify HM Coastguard if requested. Otherwise,
   contact the HM Coastguard duty manager at their 24-hour Operations Room (99-01493-
   851338).
30. (E) Air-to-Ground (A/G).
   30.1. During the radio drill on taxi out, but no later than requesting take off clearance, flight
   leads will initiate a ―Check PACS‖ radio call. All flight members will acknowledge with call
   sign ―PACS check complete, Hot/Cold Gun‖ after confirming that Training (TRNG) PACS
   stores are not loaded on stations with carted stores/fuel tanks/SUU-20s in all four PACS
   programs. Single-ship sorties will tape this procedure on the VTR System.
   30.2. Aircraft are cleared to climb out or descend in IMC to the Minimum Safe Altitude
   (MSA) under Traffic Service, provided they are within the confines of the range and the
   range is clear of other aircraft.
 16                                         LAKENHEATHI11-2F-15-EV3 26 MARCH 2009


   30.3. In planning all weapons deliveries, aircrew will refer to AFI 13-212, Range Planning
   and Operations, and the host nation's standing range orders.
   30.4. 48 FW aircrew are prohibited from doing pop-up attacks on Target 3 (the raft) at
   Donna Nook range.
   30.5. Aircraft will not descend below 1,000 feet AGL until wings level on final or on the
   approach to the pop-up point on UK ranges and Vliehors Range, Netherlands.
   30.6. Do not turn the master arm on until ensured any released weapon will impact within
   the range danger area and clearance has been given from the Range Control Officer (RCO).
   30.7. If departing the A/G range with ordnance remaining, all aircraft will accomplish a
   ―Check PACS‖ as outlined in paragraph 30.1.
31. (E) Wide Bomb Procedures. In the event of a wide bomb, aircrew will use the following
procedures:
   31.1. If crew error is not evident, note switch positions, safe them, and record release
   parameters.
   31.2. Inform the RCO if the cause of the wide bomb is positively identified as incorrect
   switch settings or target identification (ID). Weapons delivery may continue if the error has
   been rectified and clearance to continue is received from the RCO.
   31.3. If a second wide bomb is dropped, cease weapons delivery.
   31.4. Upon returning to the squadron, inform the Ops Sup.
32. (E) Off-range Attacks. Any uncarted inert training ordnance (such as GBU/AGM practice
weapons) may be employed off range. For F-15Es carrying carted A/G training ordnance (such
as BDU-33s), the master arm may be armed and simulated weapons employment is allowed
provided:
   32.1. (E) Stations with fuel tanks and/or carted A/G munitions, including SUU-20s with
   BDU-33s are not selected on the PACS.
   32.2. (E) Aircrew ensure that ―TRNG‖ is displayed in the HUD prior to pickling.
   32.3. (E) Flight leads will make a ―Check PACS‖ radio call prior to TRNG PACS use
   following any CMBT PACS delivery. All aircraft will acknowledge with their call sign
   ―PACS check complete‖, and aircrew will confirm compliance with restrictions in paragraph
   30.1.
33. Systems Malfunctions. Do not taxi to parking with any of the following:
   33.1. Utility A failure.
   33.2. Nose gear steering failure.
   33.3. Blown or flat tires.
   33.4. Brake malfunctions or anomalies.
   33.5. Hung live, hung gun, unsafe ordnance or other ordnance malfunctions that cannot be
   corrected in de-arm (e.g., jammed gun or hung training bombs that cannot be pinned).
LAKENHEATHI11-2F-15-EV3 26 MARCH 2009                                                            17


   33.6. (E) Any physical damage to either Low Altitude Navigation or Targeting Infrared for
   Night pod, SNIPER pod or data-link pod.
   33.7. Any malfunction that could cause further aircraft damage or compromise aircrew
   safety.
   33.8. Unsafe gear indication, emergency gear extension used, or landing gear anomalies. If
   traffic conditions permit (coordinate with the SOF), stop straight ahead on the RWY and
   have the gear inspected/pinned prior to taxiing clear with unsafe gear indications or when
   Emergency Gear Extension was required.
   33.9. Annotate on the AFTO Form 781A any nose wheel shimmy that requires aft stick to
   counter its affects.
34. Landing Gear Malfunctions. Aircraft experiencing unsafe gear indications after raising
the gear on takeoff will make a reasonable attempt to visually inspect the gear prior to
accomplishing the appropriate TO 1-MDS-1CL-1 procedures. If the mission was continued, do
another visual inspection of the affected aircraft, weather conditions permitting, prior to landing.
35. Fuel Imbalances. Pilots will use the following guidance when writing up fuel imbalances:
   35.1. Internal imbalance (for more than 5 minutes):
       35.1.1. Info Note: 200-600 pounds (first occurrence).
       35.1.2. Info Note (Repeat): 200-600 pounds (second consecutive occurrence).
       35.1.3. Code 3: 200-600 pounds (third consecutive occurrence).
   35.2. External imbalance:
       35.2.1. Code 1: Less than 1,000 pounds.
       35.2.2. Info Note: 1,000-1,500 pounds. Note: Up to 1,500 pound is normal, but will be
       written up for maintenance tracking purposes.
       35.2.3. Code 3: Greater than 1,500 pounds.
   35.3. Aircrew will pay particular attention to the lateral asymmetry worksheets in the 48 FW
   IFG to determine if an asymmetry exists that exceeds 5,000 foot-pounds.
36. (E) Lateral Asymmetry.
   36.1. Aircrew will communicate fuel imbalances to flight members when greater than 1,000
   pounds or any imbalance that results in 10,000 foot-pounds of lateral asymmetry using the F-
   15E Lateral Asymmetry Worksheet in the 48 FW In-Flight Guide (IFG).
       36.1.1. If the above conditions exist aircrew will: set their Angle of attack (AOA) tone
       to 24 units, avoid rapid onset of AOA, and use minimum pitch angles for maneuvering.
   36.2. Prior to release of Air-to-Ground (A/G) stores, predictive Lateral Asymmetry must be
   calculated and applied to the severity index for follow-on maneuvers.
   36.3. To the maximum extent practical, asymmetry at takeoff should be less than 5,000 foot-
   pounds. Asymmetries at takeoff greater than 10,000 foot-pounds require Squadron
   Commander (SQ/CC) approval.
 18                                        LAKENHEATHI11-2F-15-EV3 26 MARCH 2009


37. Hung and Unsafe Ordnance Procedures.
   37.1. Notify the SOF as soon as possible on the type of hung ordnance.
   37.2. For any Unsafe Gun or Gun Malfunction, declare an emergency.
   37.3. The primary hung ordnance area is the gun berm on the Golf and Kilo pads. If the gun
   berms are not available, use the secondary area for dearming unsafe or hung forward firing
   ordnance. The secondary area is the north side de-arm area heading 060 degrees when
   landing RWY 24, and 240 degrees when landing RWY 06 (i.e., pointing parallel to and down
   RWY).
   37.4. In the event of hung chaff or flares, aircrew should attempt to jettison all chaff and
   flares over water. If this is unsuccessful, aircrew will declare an emergency and RTB via a
   straight-in approach avoiding populated areas to the maximum extent possible.
38. (E) Terrain Following Radar (TFR) Failure.
   38.1. Immediately forward to 48 FW Wing Flight Safety (48 FW/SEF) information for any
   incidence of a TFR fly-up not taking place when it should, or any occurrence that cannot be
   attributed to normal systems response to a malfunction.
   38.2. Record the information off the Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) TF status
   page (AFCS detail bit - the STATUS page is the default page airborne, select STATUS at
   Pushbutton 13 when on the ground).
   38.3. Write to the Data Transfer Module (DTM) after landing. Download the TF DTM write
   data from JMPS and forward the information to 48 FW/SEF.
39. In-Flight Fuel Dumping. In addition to AFI 11-2F-15 Volume 3 and AFI 11-2F-15E
Volume 3 guidance:
   39.1. Fuel dump only for emergencies or to avoid landing distances that exceed available
   RWY length.
   39.2. Dump at or above 10,000 feet AGL and over water, when time and conditions permit.
   Include the amount of fuel dumped in the AFTO Form 781A write up.
40. Diversion Instructions. Reference the 48 FW IFG.
41. Jettison Areas, Procedures, and Parameters.
   41.1. Jettison stores SAFE.
   41.2. Take MARK point of jettison, note heading, altitude, airspeed, time, etc. (record HUD
   if possible).
   41.3. In an emergency immediately after takeoff (if time permits), turn right 10 degrees to 20
   degrees at the departure end of either RWY prior to jettison to minimize chances of injury to
   people on the ground.
   41.4. Controlled situation, reference LAKENHEATHI 13-201.
      41.4.1. DELETED.

42. Controlled Bailout Areas. The controlled bailout point is: N52-55 E000-40 LKH (CH 39)
010/31 or MLD (CH 106) 013/34. Mandatory heading 360 +/- 10 degrees, 10,000 feet MSL,
slowest available airspeed, no slower than 150 KIAS (150-250 is the safe ejection regime; higher
airspeeds may carry aircraft farther north out to sea). Throttles IDLE, autopilot engaged, if able,
for wings-level (non-turning) flight and trim set for a 750-foot per minute descent.
43. Physiological Incidents. Contact the SOF if an aircrew member experiences a
physiological incident during flight, including any cockpit decompression above FL180. The
aircrew will be met by a flight surgeon from the 48th Aerospace Medicine Squadron, Flight
Medicine Flight (48 AMDS/SGPF), immediately after clearing the RWY. Shut down the aircraft
and turn it over to maintenance for impoundment.
44. Local Weather Procedures. During Observed Induction Ice Potential Advisory (A6)
conditions on the ground or in the air, aircrew should be alert for engine icing and use engine
heat IAW TO 1F-15A-1, Flight Manual; or TO 1F-15E-1, Flight Manual.
45. Lightning within 5 NM Procedures.
   45.1. The 48th Operations Group Commander (48 OG/CC) is the approval authority for all
   takeoffs and landings during observed lightning within 5 NM. The Supervisor of Flying
   (SOF) will coordinate with the 48 OG/CC for approval on a case by case basis, taking into
   consideration the operational necessity, lightning location, storm direction of travel and
   landing RWY and status of alternates.
   45.2. Operations Supervisors (Ops Sups) should contact the SOF to determine the estimation
   of delay.
   45.3. Airborne. Hold at maximum endurance and contact the SOF for updates on field
   status, divert base and weather status. Notify the SOF of holding time and expect to be
   diverted upon reaching divert fuel.
   45.4. If in a Protective Aircraft Shelter (PAS) or chocks before engine start or after landing,
   shutdown, exit aircraft and seek shelter. After engine start and before taxi, contact Ops Sup
   for guidance to shutdown or remain running.
   45.5. Taxiing. Contact the SOF for guidance on whether to continue taxiing or hold your
   position.
   45.6. Arming/De-arm area. You will not be armed. Hold position and contact the SOF. Do
   not use the aircraft intercom to communicate with ground personnel.
   45.7. Notify the Ops Sup when aircraft reaches 1,000 pounds of fuel. If fuel state requires
   you to taxi back prior to de-arm, coordinate with the SOF and Ops Sup, taxi to parking and
   signal ground crew to chock aircraft prior to shutdown. If fuel state is critical and not cleared
 20                                       LAKENHEATHI11-2F-15-EV3 26 MARCH 2009


   to taxi back, signal de-arm crew with the speed brake (or have the SOF telephone) and have
   them chock the aircraft prior to shutdown.
   45.8. Hot pit refueling. Immediately stop refueling, hold position and contact the SOF for
   guidance. Avoid using the intercom to communicate with ground personnel.
46. Lightning Strike. Perform a battle damage check, assess external / internal damage to the
aircraft. Declare an emergency and land as soon as conditions permit.
47. Unit Standards. Wing administrative and tactical standards will be published by the 48
OG. OPRs are 48 OG/OGV and 48 OSS Weapons and Tactics (48 OSS/OSK) respectively.
48. Engine Anomaly. If an engine problem is experienced in-flight, TO 1F-15A-1 or TO 1F-
15E-1 procedures will be followed. After landing, the engine, if not off, will be shut down in
EOR. If an engine anomaly causes an abort during T/O, the engine will be shutdown in EOR. If
the anomaly cannot be isolated, both engines will be shut down and the jet will be towed to
parking.
49. Cross-Country Procedures. Aircrew will, at a minimum, check the following locations
when planning cross country sorties:
   49.1. EUCOM Airfield Vulnerability Assessment Summary Report on the Secret Internet
   Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) (http://jramp.eucom.smil.mil/jramp/index.cfm) to
   ensure there are no Force Protection and Anti-terrorism concerns for the destination.
   49.2. Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) can be accessed at http://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/ and
   on the SIPRNET at http://www.fcg.pentagon.smil.mil/.
   49.3. Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) at https://www.afd.scott.af.mil
50. Search and Rescue Combat Air Patrol (SARCAP) Procedures.
   50.1. If unable to maintain visual contact with the parachute, allow one minute per thousand
   feet of descent for a C-9 parachute.
   50.2. SARCAP aircrew should attempt to establish and maintain communications with the
   downed aircrew using GUARD or 282.8.
   50.3. In the UK, aircraft actively engaged in SAR operations should squawk Mode 3 code
   0023.
51. Local Environmental Restrictions to Flight Operations.
   51.1. Anti-exposure suits will be required for preplanned overwater flights when the water
   temperature is less than 60°F, unless waived by the 48 OG/CC IAW AFI 11-301 Volume 1
   USAFE Supplement, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program. Additionally, IAW AFI
   11-301 Volume 1 USAFE Supplement, the use of the anti-exposure suit is waived for the
   following:
       51.1.1. When the overwater portion of flight occurs only during approach or departure
       and the aircraft is within power-off gliding distance to land.
       51.1.2. Wear of exposure suit is waived for dual engine aircraft when the overwater
       portion of the flight occurs only while crossing the English Channel. This waiver does
LAKENHEATHI11-2F-15-EV3 26 MARCH 2009                                                        21


     not apply in the event of subsequent use of offshore refueling tracks, ranges, and training
     areas.
  51.2. If the water temperature ranges between 15.5C and 10.5C, and the local air
  temperature is 21.2C or greater, the squadron commander may waive the requirement of the
  anti-exposure suit considering the factors outlined in AFI 11-301 Volume 1/USAFE
