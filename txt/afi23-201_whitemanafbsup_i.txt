6.6. Hydrant Systems and Efficiency.
   6.6.1. Advocate for use of hydrant systems which; are designed to be flexible/efficient
   modes of refueling aircraft. Use hydrant systems to their utmost potential; systems are
   designed to primarily refuel and defuel large frame aircraft.
   6.6.2. Establish a Hydrant Utilization Rate (HUR). To determine the optimum hydrant to
   mobile refueler use ratio and ensure hydrant systems are adequately used. HUR will be
   performed in conjunction with the vehicle validation or as mission changes warrant
   revalidation. Note: Mission changes can include factors that affect PAT times, loss or gain
   of aircraft, and new or moved facilities etc.
   6.6.3. Coordinate the HUR with the Operations Group, Maintenance Group, and the Mission
   Support Group every three years; then staff to installation commander for approval.
   6.6.4. Understand base HUR determination is not required when a MAJCOM or base
   supplement to this instruction outlines procedures for managing hydrant utilization rates; if
   supplemented it must be reviewed on a biennial basis.
      6.6.4.1. (Added-WHITEMAN) Managing Hydrant Use. The Whiteman AFB hydrant
      fuel system is designed specifically for the B-2 and is the primary means of refueling the
      aircraft. Given the unique design of the hydrant system, the Hydrant Utilization Rate
      (HUR) is established at 90 percent.
      6.6.4.2. (Added-WHITEMAN) Procedures to document compliance will be as follow:
      The Fuels Management Flight (FMT) will use the Fuels Manager Defense program to
      monitor hydrant system usage. Additionally, the FMT will provide the monthly HUR
      through the 509th Logistics Readiness Squadron Commander.
   6.6.5. Will ensure HUR determination includes as a minimum: HUR formula/calculations,
   manpower factors, statistics, availability of equipment, and sortie rates required to support.
   6.6.6. Use the following when determining HUR:
      6.6.6.1. Hydrant eligible gallons are quantified as: any aircraft servicing occurring on a
      hydrant equipped parking spot or any aircraft servicing request that exceeds the capacity
      of one R-11 refueler (multi-service) that is on a hydrant equipped parking spot will be
      considered as hydrant eligible. Note: To best determine these eligible gallons in this
      process it is recommended that they are annotated in the remarks block of the control log.
      6.6.6.1. (WHITEMAN) Hydrant eligible gallons are quantified as: any aircraft
      servicing occurring on a hydrant equipped parking spot or any aircraft servicing request
      that exceeds the capacity of one R-11 refueler (multi-service) that is on a hydrant
      equipped parking spot will be considered as hydrant eligible. Note: To best determine
      these eligible gallons in this process it is recommended that they are annotated in the
      remarks block of the control log.
      6.6.6.2. Actual gallons moved by hydrants are determined by adding total gallons moved
      through hydrants: (refuel + defuel) consider defuels as a positive number.
      6.6.6.2. (WHITEMAN) Actual gallons moved by hydrants are determined by adding
      total gallons moved through hydrants: (refuel + defuel) consider defuels as a positive
      number.
AFI23-201_WHITEMANAFBSUP_I 30 APRIL 2013                                                       41


       6.6.6.3. HUR is calculated as a percentage by taking the actual gallons moved by
       hydrants and divided by hydrant eligible gallons equals HUR.
       6.6.6.3. (WHITEMAN) HUR is calculated as a percentage by taking the actual gallons
       moved by hydrants and divided by hydrant eligible gallons equals HUR.
       6.6.6.4. Example: If Base X actual gallons moved by hydrants were 378,540 gallons and
       the hydrant eligible gallons were 400,000. The HUR would be represented as
       378,540/400,000=.94635 or 95% HUR. Note: Ensure only servicings that occur on
       aircraft spots with hydrant outlets capable of servicing are used for utilization rate
       formulas. (For example, if an aircraft lands at a base where the parking plan does not
       make it possible to be refueled by hydrants, then it should not be considered as hydrant
       eligible.) Only those aircraft refuels that occur on spots capable of hydrant servicing
       should be considered.
       6.6.6.4. (WHITEMAN) Example: If Base X actual gallons moved by hydrants were
       378,540 gallons and the hydrant eligible gallons were 400,000. The HUR would be
       represented as 378,540/400,000=.94635 or 95% HUR. Note: Ensure only servicing’s
       that occur on aircraft spots with hydrant outlets capable of servicing are used for
       utilization rate formulas. (For example, if an aircraft lands at a base where the parking
       plan does not make it possible to be refueled by hydrants, then it should not be
       considered as hydrant eligible.) Only those aircraft refuels that occur on spots capable of
       hydrant servicing should be considered.
       6.6.7.1. Must send a request package to the MAJCOM before modifying or deactivating
       hydrant systems that includes:

Notes:
   1. FMT will evaluate personnel and only select the most qualified to attend specialized
       fuels courses. Factors to consider are:
   2. Return on investment (ROI)
   3. Retainability.
   4. Career potential.
   5. Refresher training is required when personnel fill UTCs requiring the SEI. It is highly
       recommended that members receive 30 days refresher OJT prior to filling the UTC.
   6. Normal refresher training is given at the time intervals mentioned below:

         1.  SEI 028 - Every two years from initial training or last assignment in RFM.
         2.  SEI 035 - Every year from initial training or last mission flight.
         3.  SEI 039 - Every year from initial training or last assignment in a fuels laboratory.
         4.  SEI 040 - Every year from initial training or last assignment reconciling the fuels
             account in BSM-E.
         5. SEI 369 - Every two years from initial training or last mission flight.
  7. The specific refresher training required is determined by the FMT unless specifically
     identified via UTC or other training methods as they become available.

                    REFUELING UNIT ALLOWANCE STANDARDS

A14.1. Configuration codes explained.
   A14.1.1. All validations will use the last 12 months of data to calculate authorizations.
   Activity outside of this window must be justified.
   A14.1.2. Do not use days that do not represent normal operations, including hydrant
   utilization rates.    Note: This information below also contains elements to manually
   determine refueling vehicle authorizations when per accomplishment times and historical
   refueling data does not exist.
A14.2. Determining Aviation Fuel R-11 Requirements.
   A14.2.1. VATA: Two per AFB with an aviation fuel dispersing requirement when Not
   Otherwise Authorized (NOA).
   A14.2.2. VATB: One per AFB for each additional grade of aviation fuel dispensed when
   NOA.
   A14.2.3. VATC: To determine "refuel" truck allowances for configuration code "VATC":
   select the peak refuel workload day of each month for at least 6 of the previous 12 months.
   Compile truck issue data for issues in the ranges of 1-400, 401-1800, 1801-2700, 2701-3500,
   and greater than 3500. Servicings supported by configuration codes "VATL", "VATM",
