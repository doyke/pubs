     contractors, etc.) that have a need to drive unescorted on an airfield. NOTE: The terms
     airfield, aerodrome and airport may be used interchangeably.
     1.1.2. The 140th Operations Support Squadron (140 OSS) Airfield Operations (OSA) flight
     is the lead agency/Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for developing the Airfield
     Driving Program for the wing. In turn, 140 OSS/OSA will train and certify unit ADPMs;
     unit ADPMs train/certify personnel in their unit and those they are hosting.
     1.1.3. The standards set forth in this instruction are to control vehicles and personnel on the
     airfield. Only trained, qualified and certified personnel will be assigned duties requiring
     driving on the airfield. Certified personnel must be knowledgeable of and comply with the
     provisions outlined in this instruction.
     1.1.4. In today’s complex airfield environment, there are incidents involving aircraft,
     pedestrians and ground vehicles at United States Air Force (USAF) airfields that lead to
     property damage and injury to personnel. One of the most hazardous incidents for an airfield
     driver to be involved with is a runway incursion. A runway incursion is a major violation to
     the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-off of aircraft that has the
     potential to result in aircraft endangerment and loss of life. While there are several factors
     involved in a runway incursion, the leading causes of these incidents result from a failure to
     follow procedures, inadequate vehicle operator training, and loss of situational awareness.
     Therefore, strict adherence to the procedures in this instruction is essential to preventing
     aircraft-vehicle mishaps and personnel injury on the airfield.
1.2. Authorization.
     1.2.1. Motor vehicle traffic on the airfield is restricted to Government Owned Vehicles
     (GOV) and leased vehicles (e.g., Government Services Administration (GSA)) on official
     business. Airfield Management can authorize additional vendor, contractor, construction and
     Privately Owned Vehicles (POV) as needed to support operations, but this will be kept to an
     absolute minimum.

   while on the airfield. Cell phone use is authorized if the vehicle is safely parked in an area
   that will not interrupt aircraft operations. NOTE: Hands-free devices while driving are not
   authorized. Use of these devices has the potential to impair and distract drivers (e.g.,
   prevents recognition of emergency signals/giant voice announcements, alarms, radio calls,
   aircraft movement, etc.).
   4.1.5. A current, local airfield diagram will be maintained in all vehicles operating on the
   airfield.
4.2. Vehicle Operations/Pedestrians Operating in the Controlled Movement Area (CMA).
   4.2.1. The CMA includes all taxiways, runway, 1000’ overruns, and areas within 157 feet of
   the runway/overrun edges. Coordination with the ATCT must be made prior to entry of these
   areas. Contact the ATCT upon reaching the destination and prior to proceeding to another
   location on the airfield. NOTE: Taxiway JULIET and LIMA west of taxiway GOLF are
   NON-CMA. Permission must be granted from the ATCT before proceeding past Hush
   House when heading east on taxiway LIMA (see Attachment 9).
   4.2.2. Vehicle operators/pedestrians operating in the CMA receive approval from the ATCT
   prior to entry, and must monitor/maintain radio contact with the tower while in the CMA.
   NOTE: The acceptable method of communicating with tower personnel is via Land Mobile
   Radio (LMR). Cell phones, Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF)
   radios are not authorized. Additionally, three-way relayed messages to/from the tower is
   prohibited.
   4.2.3. In the event of a radio failure or loss of communication with the ATCT while driving
   on the CMA, the tower controller will attempt to make contact with the vehicle
   operator/pedestrian by using light-gun signals or cycling the runway lights on/off. NOTE: If
   on the runway during a communication loss, exit to the nearest taxiway or road and contact
   AM for instructions. If unable to communicate with ATCT or AM via radio, use other means
   of communication such as a mobile phone (if available). ATCT will also contact AM Ops to
   track down vehicles who have lost contact and escort them off the airfield.
BUCKLEYAFBI13-213 17 APRIL 2014                                                                  23

   Ramp, Mike Apron, Taxiway JULIET and Taxiway LIMA/LIMA Apron west of taxiway
   GOLF. Drivers in these areas must be airfield driving certified and possess an AF IMT 487,
   but two-way radio communications with the ATCT is not required. Vehicle operators and
   pedestrians will proceed with caution, be vigilant for aircraft activity and abide by the
   contents of this instruction even while operating in uncontrolled movement areas.
4.4. Control Tower Light-Gun Signals.
   4.4.1. Decals depicting light-gun signals and their meanings are required in all vehicles
   operating on the runway/CMA. The Air Force version (AFVA 11-240, USAF Airfield Signs
   and Markings) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Form 5280-7, Airfield Visual
   Aid Safety Placard) are both authorized and available from airfield management (in limited
   quantities). Units requiring large numbers of decals should order decals online.
      4.4.1.1. AFVA 11-240 is available from the Warehouse Management System (WMS) at
      https://wmsweb.afncr.af.mil/wms/.

   vehicles (i.e., fleet service trucks, fuel trucks, etc.), due to design or particular operation, are
   sometimes required to park perpendicular to the aircraft.
   4.10.3. Vehicles will not be parked or left on the aircraft parking apron or taxiways unless in
   direct support of a specific airframe/mission and with airfield management approval.
   4.10.4. When inside operational aircraft areas, the driver will perform the following steps
   when exiting the vehicle:
       4.10.4.1. Turn off the ignition (to preclude possible gear-jump), set the emergency
       brakes, place a manual transmission in reverse or an automatic transmission in park, and
       leave the keys in the ignition.
       4.10.4.2. Use chocks to secure all vehicles and wheeled equipment without an integral
       braking system when left unattended on aircraft-parking ramps.
   4.10.5. Aircraft must be chocked and engines shut down on the appropriate side before stair
   trucks/boarding ramps are positioned.
   4.10.6. Vehicles parked within 10 feet of any aircraft will have one rear wheel chocked fore
   and aft with parking brake applied. Chocks will be used to secure all vehicles and wheeled
   equipment without an integral braking system.
   4.10.7. All wheeled AGE and maintenance equipment will be braked or, if not equipped
   with brakes, chocked.
4.11. Lateral Distance Requirements for Mobile Obstacles.
   4.11.1. Vehicles operating in/or around the airfield are considered mobile obstacles and must
   comply with the following:
       4.11.1.1. The lateral clearance distance from taxiway centerline to a fixed or mobile
       object is 200 feet. When operating off the edges of a taxiway, do not park or operate a
       vehicle within 200 feet of the taxiway center line. No vehicle or equipment will be
       parked and left unattended within 200 feet of the taxiway centerline without a Major
       Command (MAJCOM) approved waiver.
       4.11.1.2. The lateral clearance distance from the edge of all ramps and aprons to a
       mobile obstacle is 50 feet from the wingtip of any aircraft. When operating off the edges
       of a ramp or apron, do not park or operate a vehicle within 50 feet of a moving aircraft.
       To ensure separation from any aircraft utilizing the airfield, vehicles should park a
       minimum of 170 feet from the edge of the parking apron.
       4.11.1.3. The lateral clearance distance from the runway centerline to a fixed or mobile
       object is 1,000 feet. When operating within this area, do not park or leave vehicles
       unattended. EXCEPTION: Transient apron.
       4.11.1.4. Additional information on ground support equipment (mobile) and airfield
       vehicles can be found in Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-260-01. Deviations to this
       policy require coordination and approval from 140 OSS/OSA. Note: Mobile ground
       support equipment is exempt from clearance distance criteria. Examples of ground
       support equipment include:         aerospace ground equipment, electrical carts, fire
       extinguisher carts, and portable floodlights. When such equipment is NOT in use, it must
       be removed from the taxiways and apron edges, and stored in areas that do not violate
BUCKLEYAFBI13-213 17 APRIL 2014                                                                  29


       aircraft clearance requirements for normal operating routes. For the purpose of this
       instruction, equipment is defined as support equipment in place not more than 3 hours
       before aircraft arrival or 3 hours after aircraft departure.
4.12. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Control/Prevention.
   4.12.1. Vehicle operators must make every attempt to stay on paved surfaces and avoid
   driving on unimproved surfaces (e.g., dirt, grass, etc.). If driving on unimproved surfaces is
   required, conduct a FOD check upon exit of these areas or returning to paved surfaces. FOD
   checkpoints are located on each paved surface leading to the airfield. When conducting a
   FOD check, set gear to PARK or REVERSE (if manual transmission), turn off the ignition,
   leave keys in vehicle and set the emergency brake.
   4.12.2. At a minimum, a FOD check will consist of the following:
       4.12.2.1. Inspection of vehicle tires (pull forward to check tire in contact with the
       pavement). This is referred to as a “roll-over” FOD check. Remove any foreign
       materials (e.g., rocks, gravel, etc) as applicable.
       4.12.2.2. A visual check to ensure all external vehicle components are secured. Secure
       all items in a payload vehicle, including all tie-down device loose ends such as chains,
       ropes, packaging or other items that may become dislodged during movement while on
       the airfield. Additionally, close all truck tailgates and tool compartments prior to
       entering the airfield.
       4.12.2.3. A thorough walk-around of the vehicle to check for damaged, loose or worn
       parts.
   4.12.3. If there is a significant amount of FOD (too much for an operator/pedestrian to pick
   up), contact airfield management via LMR or phone, who in turn will respond and/or request
   additional support.
   4.12.4. Vehicles operating on the airfield are required to have a FOD container/receptacle.
   4.12.5. Hats are not authorized on the airfield due to their FOD potential. See AFI 21-101,
   Chapter 14 and AFMAN 24-306, Chapter 20 for additional guidance.
4.13. Restricted Visibility or Night Operations.
   4.13.1. Headlights will be turned on from sunset to sunrise, and during periods of inclement
   weather or reduced visibility.
   4.13.2. Poor weather conditions (e.g., fog, rain, etc.) have the potential to obscure visual
   cues, airfield markings and signs. Vehicle operators must remain vigilant of their
   surroundings and operating boundaries.
       4.13.2.1. When visibility is less than 92m (300 feet), refueling and explosive loaded
       vehicles will not be operated unless directed by the 140th wing commander.
       4.13.2.2. When visibility is less than 31m (100) feet, vehicles (except emergency
       response vehicles) will not be operated on the airfield.
       4.13.2.3. When visibility is less than 16m (50 feet), it is recommended that a walking
       guide equipped with a flashing or luminescent wand be used during emergency
       movement of alert vehicles.

   4.13.3. During night operations, vehicles facing a taxiing aircraft must turn off vehicle
   headlights and turn on hazard lights until the aircraft passes.
   4.13.4. Exercise caution to ensure vehicle headlights are not pointed towards taxiing aircraft.
   Vehicles with daytime running lights (DRL) will park in a safe location with ignition off,
   parking brake set, and emergency flashers on until the aircraft passes.
   4.13.5. Flashing hazard lights or parking lights will be used during the hours of darkness or
   inclement weather when vehicles are temporarily parked on any part of the ramp. NOTE:
   The only designated parking area on the airfield for extended periods of time is west and east
   of Hangar 801, and west of Hangar 909. Exceptions will be made by the AFM on a case-to-
   case basis and dependent on mission.
4.14. Restrictions for Operating Motorcycles, Mopeds, Scooters, Bicycles, and Other
Vehicles.
   4.14.1. Privately owned bicycles, mopeds, motorcycles, three-wheeled vehicles and motor
   homes are not authorized on the airfield.
   4.14.2. Government-owned bicycles used in the course of official government business may
   only operate on the ramp excluding taxiways and runways, provided all safety requirements
   are met (i.e., reflectors, helmet, etc.) and with prior coordination/approval from Airfield
   Operations.
   4.14.3. Government-owned electric or gas powered golf carts are authorized on the ramps,
   but not on the CMA. Operators of these vehicles must also be certified to drive on the
   airfield.
4.15. Unique Unit Requirements/Operations and Local Restrictions.
   4.15.1. Instrument Landing System (ILS) Critical Areas. The Localizer critical area is
   located on the north end of the airfield, and the Glide Slope critical area is located on the
   south end of the airfield (see Attachment 11). During poor weather conditions (cloud
   ceiling equal to or less than 800 feet and visibility less than or equal to 2 miles), contact the
   ATCT for approval into these critical areas. NOTE: Buckley ATCT will normally notify
   vehicle operators if there is aircraft activity and/or weather circumstances dictate holding
   short of critical areas.
   4.15.2. Restricted Areas. There are three distinctly marked restricted areas for local F-16
   parking—south of Hangar 801, east of Hangar 801 and the alert aircraft shelters. Entry
   Control Points (ECP) must be used when aircraft are in parked in these areas (see
   Attachment 10). Do not enter any restricted area without proper authorization. Violations
   will be handled through 140th Security Forces.
   4.15.3. Airfield Entry Points. Enter the airfield via Aspen Street Gate #3, Breckenridge
   Avenue Gate #15, or the East Ramp Gate #20 (see Attachment 13) for routine, day-to-day
   activities.
   4.15.4. Entering the Runway. Vehicle operators may enter the runway from the Main Ramp
   via Taxiway KILO. From the east side of the runway, operators can enter from Taxiways
   MIKE, NOVEMBER, YANKEE, and FOXTROT (South Hammerhead). Vehicle operators
   must have ATCT approval prior to entering any taxiway and runway, and drivers will report
   off the runway once clear of the runway hold line.
BUCKLEYAFBI13-213 17 APRIL 2014                                                                  31


   4.15.5. Vehicle Supplemental Traction Devices. Safety chains or studded tires are not
   required, used or authorized on the aerodrome.
   4.15.6. Night Driving. To conserve energy, airfield lighting is normally turned off during
   darkness unless there is aircraft activity. If access is needed to the CMA, contact the ATCT
   to request lighting be turned on. Another reason for airfield lighting to be turned off is for
   Army Aviation Support Facility (AASF) Night Vision Goggle (NVG) training. Vehicle
   operators will not drive on the airfield with NVG devices. The ATCT will notify Army
   aircraft of vehicles on the airfield during NVG training.
   4.15.7. In-Ground Fuel Pits. There are no in-ground refueling pits located on the airfield.
   4.15.8. Jet Blast Hazards. All spots on the aircraft parking apron are authorized engine run-
   up areas to 80%. Vehicle operators and personnel must avoid all areas behind an aircraft
   performing or about to perform an engine run.
   4.15.9. The ATCT controls all vehicle, pedestrian and aircraft movement on the taxiways
   and runway. Unlike many locations that only requires radio contact with tower prior to
   entering the runway, contact with and approval from ATCT must be made prior to entering
   any taxiway or runway. EXCEPTION: Mike Apron, Taxiway JULIET, Lima Apron and
   Taxiway LIMA up to Taxiway GOLF, and closed Taxiways CHARLIE, DELTA and ECHO
   are not part of CMA.
   4.15.10. Driving over Aircraft Arresting Gear. Vehicle operators will not drive over the
   MB-100 textile braking system (cable) in the overruns. If driving over the Type-H arresting
   system on the runway, avoid running over donuts with the vehicle.
   4.15.11. Hot Spots. Taxilane ALFA north of the alert shelters is a hot spot on the main
   parking apron (see Attachment 10) due to the potential for aircraft and vehicles to converge
   on each other. Vehicle operators must have situational awareness of arriving and departing
   aircraft to avoid a circumstance that would impede taxiing aircraft.
   4.15.12. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) Storage Area. AGE hold areas exist on the
   asphalt pavement south of the Main F-16 Apron and on the asphalt pavement west of Hangar
   909.
   4.15.13. Designated Smoking Areas.
      4.15.13.1. Smoking is prohibited in all government owned or leased vehicles.
      4.15.13.2. Smoking is prohibited on the aircraft parking aprons or within any portion of
      the CMA and infield areas.
      4.15.13.3. The designated smoking areas on the airfield are located under the east side
      awning of Hangar 801, and west side of Hangar 909.
   4.15.14. Designated Jogging Areas. Jogging or any other form of physical fitness or
   sporting activity (e.g., cycling, wing fun runs, etc.) on the airfield is prohibited. Deviations
   to this policy require 140th wing leadership authorization and approval.
4.16. Control Tower/Vehicle Radio Problem Areas and Tower Blind Spots.
   4.16.1. There are no known radio dead spots.
   4.16.2. Tower visual blind spots are depicted in Attachment 12.
 32                                                    BUCKLEYAFBI13-213 17 APRIL 2014


4.17. Emergency Response Vehicle Operations.
   4.17.1. Emergency response vehicles (e.g., fire department, hospital, security forces, etc.)
   responding to an emergency (real world and exercise) will request ATCT approval prior to
   entering the taxiways/runway. An emergency does not automatically grant access onto
   taxiways/runway, and speed limits must be consistent with conditions and equipment being
   operated.
   4.17.2. Vehicles not directly involved or supporting an emergency will leave the airfield, and
   stop/yield the right-of-way to emergency vehicles as required. Vehicles may withdraw to
   Airfield Operations (Hangar 909) or their work center until the emergency is terminated.
   4.17.3. Follow-on/support response agencies are required to standby either on the parking
   apron or hold lines on taxiways until call forward by the Fire Chief or On-Scene
   Commander.
4.18. Use of Perimeter Roads, In-field, Service or Other Roads.
   4.18.1. The aerodrome does not have a complete service road around the airfield. Service
   roads are either paved or unpaved, and typically used by airfield management, United States
   Department of Agriculture (USDA), Safety, Security Forces, Airfield Systems Maintenance
   (ASM), Civil Engineering (CE) and contractors with prior approval for construction projects.
   NOTE: Sunlight Way near the control tower is used for Combat Arms Training and
   Maintenance (CATM) instructors and trainees. Contractors with prior approval from 140
   OSS/OSA or under escort for construction purposes may also use this road.
4.19. Vehicle Traffic Flow.
   4.19.1. Drivers must use the most direct route to their destination and minimize the distance
   traveled on the airfield. On taxiways, taxilanes and runway, drivers will operate vehicles to
   the right of centerline in the direction of travel, and use appropriate turn signals (see
   Attachment 6). Note: Do not drive on taxiway or runway centerlines unless required in
   performance of official duties (e.g., airfield checks, inspections, sweeper operations, aircraft
   towing, etc.). Additionally, do not drive on the centerline during snow events in order to
   avoid packing down the snow.
4.20. Vehicle Yielding Rules.
   4.20.1. Ground vehicle operators will yield the right of way to all aircraft and:
       4.20.1.1. Will not cross a taxiway or cross in front of an approaching aircraft that is
       within 200 feet or until the aircraft has passed by at least 500 feet.
       4.20.1.2. Will remain at least 100 feet away from any helicopters with rotors in motion.
       4.20.1.3. Will yield the right-of-way to any vehicle crossing intersection.
       4.20.1.4. Will yield the right-of-way to all emergency response and/or alert vehicles with
       rotating lights in motion.
4.21. Disabled Vehicles on the Airfield.
   4.21.1. If a vehicle has a malfunction that prevents operation under its own power, every
   means will be used to alert personnel and/or taxiing aircraft in the vicinity. At a minimum,
   the ground vehicle operator will:
BUCKLEYAFBI13-213 17 APRIL 2014                                                                33


       4.21.1.1. Leave the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers ON if the malfunction
       occurs during the hours of darkness or on the CMA.
       4.21.1.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, make the following transmission:
       “All agencies BREAK BREAK – this is (vehicle call sign) with an emergency for airfield
       management and tower.” State the nature of the emergency and report the position on the
       airfield. If no radio is available, contact airfield management via cell phone.
       4.21.1.3. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (e.g., security forces, civil
       engineering, transient alert, fire department, etc.) should make every effort to assist
       getting the disabled vehicle off the airfield, especially the runway, taxiways and parking
       apron paved areas.
       4.21.1.4. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio or cell phone, stay with the
       vehicle and continue attempts to alert taxiing aircraft or other vehicles in the vicinity.
       4.21.1.5. In the event of a disabled vehicle on the CMA, the vehicle operator will
       immediately notify ATCT and airfield management by any means possible to coordinate
       expeditious removal of the disabled vehicle from the CMA.
          4.21.1.5.1. Vehicle operators will ensure the disabled vehicle is not left unattended in
          the CMA.
          4.21.1.5.2. Disabled vehicles will be removed using any method in the quickest and
          safest way possible.
4.22. Airfield Tours.
   4.22.1. Large-scale events and tours of the airfield will be conducted and coordinated
   through the 140 WG/460 SW Public Affairs Office. The Public Affairs Office will notify
   airfield management of any event that involves tours of the airfield and provide details (e.g.,
   who, what, when, where the tour will take place) so flying operations are not impacted.
4.23. Passengers/Cargo in Vehicles Operating on the Airfield.
   4.23.1. Personnel will not ride on any part of a vehicle not intended for carrying passengers,
   nor will they ride in or upon trailers.
   4.23.2. Passengers will remain seated while the vehicle is in motion and will keep their arms
   and legs within the vehicle body.
   4.23.3. Passengers will use available seat belts at all times while the vehicle is in motion
   (Technical Order (T.O.) 36A-1-6).
   4.23.4. Passengers will not ride in the doorways or sit on the engine cover of metro vans
   (also called step-vans). Rear door nets will be in place while passengers are transported and
   the doors are open.
   4.23.5. Side doors on passenger vans will be closed while the vehicle is in motion.
   4.23.6. Passengers are prohibited from riding on towed equipment.

   4.23.8. Cargo will be secured using ropes, chains, or chocks to prevent injury or damage
   caused by falling or sliding. Cargo extended beyond the body of the vehicle will have a red
   flag attached during daylight hours or a red warning reflector/light during hours of darkness.
4.24. Pedestrian Movement on the Airfield.
   4.24.1. Pedestrians are authorized on the airfield for official business in support of the flying
   mission.
   4.24.2. Pedestrians on the airfield will walk facing oncoming traffic.
   4.24.3. Personnel will not sit or recline on the ramp in a manner that interferes with normal
   ground vehicle and aircraft operations.
   4.24.4. Personnel will not enter the taxiways/runway/CMA without two-way radio contact
   and approval from the control tower.
4.25. End of Runway (EoR) Procedures.
   4.25.1. Ground support equipment such as fire bottles, light-alls, etc. on the parking apron
   will be removed from the airfield when flying operations have ended for the day. Equipment
   may be placed 3 hours prior to scheduled activities and left no longer than 3 hours after
   flying operations are completed.
4.26. Privately Owned Vehicle (POV)/Government Leased Vehicle Passes (Permanent).
   4.26.1. Permanent Passes for POV/Government Leased Vehicles are not issued for the
   aerodrome.
4.27. POV/Government Leased Vehicle Passes (Temporary).
   4.27.1. POVs on the airfield are highly discouraged. A Memorandum for Record (MFR)
   from the unit commander/company representative requesting POVs on the airfield may be
   submitted annually if mission requirements dictate.        Unit commanders/company
   representative must ensure documentation is accurate and validated annually or resubmit
   when POV information changes. Personnel requiring access onto the airfield will be airfield
   driving qualified or be escorted.
   4.27.2. Passes (see Attachment 26) will normally be issued for short-term TDY and airfield
   construction projects only and not for convenience. NOTE: Use of POV and Government

                                          Chapter 5

        ENFORCEMENT, REPORTING AND VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

5.1. Enforcement.
   5.1.1. Airfield driving violations put ground personnel, aircrews and high value assets at
   risk. Unit commanders and ADPMs will be notified by the AFM or AAFM in writing when
   airfield driving privileges are revoked. The following will be used as a baseline guide and is
   not intended to cover every possible violation/scenario.
   5.1.2. The AFM, 140 WG/SE and wing ADPM will work as a team to assign all runway
   incursions an operational category (i.e., Operational Error, Pilot Deviation and
   Vehicle/Pedestrian) defined in Attachment 1 for trend analysis. The AFM will ensure these
   classifications are annotated in the recommendation section of AF Form 457 or the narrative
   section of AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report.
   5.1.3. The wing ADPM is responsible for taking immediate actions to correct any identified
   systematic problems, and ensuring interim control measures are applied until permanent
   corrections are made.
5.2. Runway Intrusions/CMA Violations.
   5.2.1. Runway intrusions (also known as incursions) are the most serious CMA violation and
   are the result of an unauthorized entry or erroneous occupation of a runway or other surface
   used for takeoff and landing of aircraft regardless of impact of aircraft safety. These
   incidents can be caused by aircraft, vehicles, pedestrians, or communication errors.
   Normally, intrusions are caused by communication errors, lack of familiarity with an airfield,
   loss of situational awareness, distractions, etc.
   5.2.2. The tower/ground controller will immediately notify airfield management of all
   runway intrusions/CMA violations, who in turn will respond and escort the individual(s) off
   the airfield to complete a runway/CMA violation worksheet (see Attachment 7). NOTE:
   FAA Form 8020-25, Investigation of Vehicle or Pedestrian Deviation Report, may also be
   used as necessary.
      5.2.2.1. The AFM or AAFM will investigate the incident along with Safety and ATCT
      personnel as necessary. The unit commander or company representative of the individual
      who committed a runway incursion will be notified that one of their unit personnel was
      involved in a CMAV and the incident is under investigation. This notification will be
      made within 24 hours or the next duty day of the alleged incident, whichever occurs first.
          5.2.2.1.1. The wing ADPM and 140 WG/SE must inspect the unit airfield driving
          program of personnel that commit a runway incursion as part of the investigation.
          Emphasis will be placed on how the unit trained the individual and their compliance
          with this instruction.
          5.2.2.1.2. Results of an investigation will be forwarded to 140 OSS/CC, through the
          AFM, and to the violator’s commander. If driving privileges are suspended/revoked,
          the individual will be completely retrained to the standards contained in this
BUCKLEYAFBI13-213 17 APRIL 2014                                                                37


          instruction. A subsequent runway intrusion in most cases will result in a permanent
          suspension/loss of airfield driving privileges.
       5.2.2.2. Runway intrusions/CMA violations will be reported IAW AFMAN 91-223,
       Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports, Chapter 6.
          5.2.2.2.1. For intrusions/violations that had an adverse impact on flight operations
          (arrivals, departures, etc.), an AF Form 651 will be submitted to the 140th Wing
          Safety Office within 24 hours of the incident.
          5.2.2.2.2. For intrusions/violations that did not impact flying operations, an AF Form
          457, USAF Hazard Report will be submitted to the 140th Wing Safety Office within
          24 hours of the incident. NOTE: MAJCOM Airfield Operations division (A3) will be
          notified within 24 hours of any CMAV/HATR incident.
   5.2.3. The AF Form 457 or AF Form 651 will include the following information in the
   narrative section:
       5.2.3.1. Individual’s information (e.g., rank, job title, organization, TDY, base assigned,
       etc.)
       5.2.3.2. Individuals experience working on or near the airfield and date trained.
       5.2.3.3. If the individual was authorized on the airfield and/or CMA.
       5.2.3.4. If the individual completed all training required to operate a vehicle on the
       airfield.
       5.2.3.5. Location (or approximate location) where the CMAV occurred (e.g.,
       runway/taxiway intersections, distance from thresholds, overruns, etc.). NOTE: The
       wing ADPM will maintain a copy of the AF IMTs 651/457, actions taken, results and
       supporting documentation in accordance with Air Force RDS, Table 13-06, Rule 15.00
       (see AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Program and AFMAN 91-223). A copy of
       the final runway incursion Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS) report may be
       obtained from the 140 WG/SE and/or MAJCOM OPR for airfield operations.
   5.2.4. All incidents will be documented and briefed at quarterly Airfield Operations Board
   meetings. Units must provide specific information (who, what, when, where, how) for trend
   analysis, and documentation kept for the current and previous calendar years. NOTE:
   Trends will be highlighted showing upward/downward incident rates (as applicable).
5.3. General Airfield Driving Violations.
   5.3.1. Personnel witnessing a general airfield driving infraction (e.g., speeding, not
   performing FOD checks, etc.) should immediately notify airfield management and give a
   brief description and location of the incident. Airfield management personnel will respond
   and escort the individual off the airfield and complete a violation worksheet (see
   Attachment 7).
   5.3.2. Violations without an aircraft incident will result in refresher training with emphasis
   on areas concerning the violation. Subsequent and repeated violations may result in the loss
   of an individual’s AF IMT 487 and certification.
 38                                                  BUCKLEYAFBI13-213 17 APRIL 2014


5.4. AF IMT 487 Suspension, Revocation, and Reinstatement.
   5.4.1. Gross or repeated violations of safety or airfield driving rules, or an overall
   demonstrated lack of ability on the part of ground vehicle operators will result in a
   suspension or revocation of airfield driving privileges. Common reasons for suspension
   include speeding, reckless driving, misuse/abuse of the vehicle, physical/mental impairment,
   display of poor judgment or behavior, and unsafe acts or behavior. Verbal warnings may be
   given by anyone witnessing a violation.
      5.4.1.1. For an actual or suspected runway incursion, the individual’s AF IMT 487 must
      be surrendered to AM and airfield driving privileges temporarily suspended until an
      investigation and retraining is completed.
      5.4.1.2. The AFM, AAFM, unit commanders, unit ADPMs, 140th SFS personnel and
      other designated representatives are authorized to temporarily suspend, confiscate and
      revoke an individual’s AF IMT 487/airfield driving privileges from any individual
      violating the provisions of this instruction or performing unsafe acts on the airfield--
      without debate. NOTE: Unit commanders and ADPMs may confiscate, suspend and
      revoke airfield driving privileges for personnel assigned to their unit only.
          5.4.1.2.1. Suspension or revocation of a driver’s AF IMT 487 should be based on the
          severity and/or number of infractions committed by an individual (see Table 5.1.).
          Recommendations for permanent revocation requires 140 OSS/CC review and
          concurrence.
          5.4.1.2.2. Any individual who has their AF IMT 487 revoked must accomplish all
          training criteria as an initial airfield driver prior to certification (excluding color
          vision testing). The unit commander will send a letter (see Attachment 28) to the
          140 OSS/CC and wing ADPM requesting reinstatement of airfield driving privileges,
          and include successful completion of all training IAW this instruction.
BUCKLEYAFBI13-213 17 APRIL 2014                                                         39

Hot Spot—A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Instrument Hold line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect. An instrument hold line is marked in
retro-reflective yellow paint.
Light Gun—A handheld directional light signaling device which emits a brilliant narrow beam
of white, green, or red light as selected by the tower controller. The color and type of light
transmitted can be used to approve or disapprove anticipated pilot actions where radio
communication is not available. The light gun is used for controlling traffic operating in the
vicinity of the airport and on the airport movement area.
Major Command (MAJCOM)—For the purpose of this instruction, includes all USAF Major
Commands plus the Air National Guard Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve Command, Direct
Reporting Units, and Field Operating Agencies.
Parking Ramp/Apron—Areas where aircraft are parked, loaded and unloaded and serviced
between flights. Vehicles and aircraft operate in close proximity in these areas, so it is vital to
maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and aircraft. Always yield to aircraft and never
drive under an aircraft or its wings. Slow speed and extreme caution are required in these areas.

the ground beneath) used to park aircraft or equipment. The terms ramp and apron may be used
interchangeably.
Restricted Area—An area on the airfield designated for the use by aircraft/equipment requiring
security protection level, and marked with signs prior to entering. Red lines will indicate the
restricted area boundaries.
Runway—A defined rectangular area on an airfield prepared for the landing and takeoff of
aircraft.
Runway Hold line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect.
Runway Incursion—Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-
off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.

   RADIO COMMUNICATION, PHRASEOLOGY, DISCIPLINE AND TECHNIQUE

A2.1. General.
   A2.1.1. Radio communications are a critical link in the air traffic control system. The
   single, most important thought in communicating with air traffic control tower personnel is
   understanding. It is essential to acknowledge each radio transmission with air traffic
   controllers by using appropriate call-signs and terminology.
A2.1.2. Brevity is also an important aspect in communicating with ATCT personnel.
Controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly respond to vehicle operator
and pedestrian requests. Conversely, vehicle operators and pedestrians must know what the
controller expects from them.
   A2.1.3. Vehicle operators and pedestrians must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic
   control radio communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when
   operating on the runway and/or CMA. NOTE: Always monitor the appropriate radio
   frequency when operating on the runway or within the CMA.
   A2.1.4. Never assume anything.
   A2.1.5. Always ask for assistance if you have any doubt about whether to proceed.
   A2.1.6. If the instructions you receive from the tower controller are unclear, ask that they be
   repeated again by stating, “Say Again.”
   A2.1.7. If there is anything about the air traffic controller’s instructions you do not
   understand, ask for further explanations—do not assume.
   A2.1.8. Vehicle operators and pedestrians must give aircraft and ground control
   transmissions priority unless an emergency exists.
   A2.1.9. The tower controller has ultimate authority over all traffic entering the runway/CMA
   and will issue specific instructions that approve/disapprove the movement of vehicles,
   equipment and personnel on the runway/CMA. NOTE: No activity on the runway/CMA is
   authorized without tower authorization.
A2.2. Radio Technique.
   A2.2.1. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
   transmitter/radio will be ineffective and probably override/block out the other receiver,
   causing the other vehicle operator/pedestrian to repeat his or her call.
   A2.2.2. Think before keying the transmitter/radio, and know what to say before you need to
   say it.
   A2.2.3. The radio should be close to your lips, and after pressing the transmit button a slight
   pause may be necessary before you start speaking. Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
   NOTE: The tower controller may have difficulty in hearing your requests if there is
   sufficient background noise (e.g., wind, chatter, etc.).

   A2.2.4. After releasing the transmit button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The
   controller may be looking for your location on the airfield, transmitting on a different
   frequency, or scanning the runway/CMA to enable your request.
   A2.2.5. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio and ground station
   equipment. Refer to the airfield diagram or this instruction to determine radio blind
   spots/dead zones.
   A2.2.6. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver/radio. Check the volume,
   frequency/channel, battery level and make sure the transmit button is not stuck in the
   transmit position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
   unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
   “stuck/hot mike,” and controllers may refer to it in this manner while attempting to correct
   the problem.
   A2.2.7. Vehicles operating on the runway/CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent
   radio mounted in the vehicle to communicate with tower controllers. A hand-held radio
   should only be used as a backup or when communication is required outside the vehicle.
   NOTE: Conduct an operational test of the radio before entering the airfield.
   A2.2.8. Air traffic controllers will not issue or use unconditional instructions (blanket
   approval) when authorizing vehicles to enter the runway for the purpose of airfield
   inspections/checks or any other operation.
   A2.2.9. The tower controller will instruct vehicle operators and pedestrians requiring access
   on the taxiways/runway/CMA on the Tower Net.
A2.3. Phraseology.
   A2.3.1. Vehicle operators and pedestrians must contact the tower controller each and every
   time they proceed onto or leave the runway/CMA. When proceeding onto the CMA, you
   must advise the controller of three critical pieces of information: WHO you are (call sign),
   WHERE you are and WHAT your intentions are. Operators must always acknowledge all
   communications so the tower/ground controller knows that the message was received.
   A2.3.2. A typical runway/CMA entry transmission sequence is as follows:
BUCKLEYAFBI13-213 17 APRIL 2014                                                        49




Figure A2.1. A Typical Runway/CMA Entry Transmission Sequence is as Follows
      VEHICLE OPERATOR:                         “BUCKLEY GROUND, SWEEPER1”

      TOWER/GROUND CONTROLLER:                  “SWEEPER1, PROCEED ONTO RUNWAY
                                                14 FROM TAXIWAY KILO AND ADVISE
                                                WHEN OFF”
      VEHICLE OPERATOR:                         “SWEEPER1, UNDERSTAND APPROVED
                                                ON RUNWAY 14 FROM TAXIWAY KILO,
                                                WILL ADVISE WHEN OFF.”
NOTE: When entering the taxiways/runway/CMA, visually scan the area prior to entering,
and then proceed as directed.
   A2.3.3. Conversely, the tower controller may not always approve a request, depending on
   aircraft traffic or other activity. For example:

Figure A2.2. Tower Controller May Not Always Approve a Request, Depending on
Aircraft Traffic or Other Activity. For Example
      VEHICLE OPERATOR:                            “BUCKLEY GROUND, LIGHTING1”
      TOWER/GROUND CONTROLLER:                     “LIGHTING1, BUCKLEY GROUND”
      VEHICLE OPERATOR:                            “BUCKLEY GROUND, LIGHTING1
                                                   REQUESTS ACCESS ONTO RUNWAY 14
                                                   FROM TAXIWAY KILO”
      TOWER/GROUND CONTROLLER:                     “LIGHTING1, BUCKLEY GROUND HOLD
                                                   SHORT OF RUNWAY 14.”
      VEHICLE OPERATOR:                            “BUCKLEY GROUND, LIGHTING1
                                                   UNDERSTAND HOLD SHORT OF
                                                   RUNWAY 14.”
NOTE: There is no need to repeat the request. When the tower/ground controller is
available to communicate with you again, he/she will contact you. Continuing with the
above example:

      TOWER/GROUND CONTROLLER:                     “LIGHTING1, BUCKLEY GROUND”
      VEHICLE OPERATOR:                            “BUCKLEY GROUND, LIGHTING 1”
      TOWER/GROUND CONTROLLER:                     “LIGHTING1, BUCKLEY GROUND
                                                   PROCEED ONTO RUNWAY 14 AND
                                                   ADVISE WHEN OFF”
      VEHICLE OPERATOR:                            “BUCKLEY GROUND, LIGHTING1
                                                   UNDERSTAND APPROVED ON RUNWAY
                                                   14, WILL ADVISE WHEN OFF.”


   A2.3.4. ALWAYS read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time
   for correction if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if
   you do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat it. Good
   communications only occurs when each party knows and understands what the other is
   saying.
   A2.3.5. Use extreme caution when you hear the phrase “Go Ahead.” Tower/ground
   controllers use this to mean “state your request.” It NEVER means to proceed.
   A2.3.6. DO NOT use the word “clear” or “cleared” or other variation when reporting on/off
   the runway or CMA. This word is reserved for pilots and air traffic controllers only.
BUCKLEYAFBI13-213 17 APRIL 2014                                                      51


  EXCEPTION: Vehicle operators and pedestrians may reply “loud and clear” in response to
  tower controller requests for radio transmission quality or clarity.
  A2.3.7. Never use Citizens Band (CB) lingo, law enforcement “ten” codes or personnel
  names while operating on the airfield. For example, “Good Buddy” and “10-4” are not
  authorized terms.

A2.4. Aviation/Phonetic Alphabet.
    A2.4.1. Because some letters have similar sounds (e.g., B and P), the international aviation
    community uses the following words to reduce and avoid confusion. For example, Taxiway
    B is referred to as Taxiway BRAVO. Vehicle operators and pedestrians must know and use
    the following phonetic alphabet when operating on the airfield:

                  QUICK FACTS/GENERAL POINTS TO REMEMBER

A3.1. Know and understand vehicle operating procedures and NEVER deviate from them.
A3.2. Be patient, observant, and non-assuming.
A3.3. Drive slowly.
A3.4. Always know your exact location and be aware of activity around you.
A3.5. Never drive under any part of an aircraft or allow its wing to pass over your vehicle.
A3.6. Maintain a safe distance from parked or taxiing aircraft.
A3.7. Aircraft ALWAYS have the right of way.
A3.8. Display proper identification and security access permits.
A3.9. Make sure your vehicle is properly equipped for the area you operate, i.e., radio, beacons,
reflective markings, lighting, etc.
A3.10. Pilots have a limited field of view from the cockpit—don’t assume they can see you.
A3.11. Be aware of emergency vehicles—always yield to them.
A3.12. Report any accident, no matter how minor, to your supervisor immediately.
A3.13. Use extreme caution when driving at night and/or in poor weather conditions.
A3.14. Realize you can become disoriented even in the best conditions—when disoriented, stop
and request assistance (as required).
A3.15. Be alert to any foreign object debris (FOD)—either pick it up or notify someone who
can.
A3.16. When driving in the controlled movement area (CMA):
   A3.16.1. DO NOT enter the CMA and NEVER drive your vehicle/walk on or across the
   runway unless you have a mission requirement and permission from the control tower.
   A3.16.2. Monitor your two-way radio with the tower at all times.
   A3.16.3. After receiving permission from the tower, proceed only after you have looked in
   all directions—including up.
   A3.16.4. Repeat all instructions from the tower verbatim and read back all hold short
   instructions.
A3.17. Always drive on the far right side of the taxiway if there is no access road that runs
parallel to the taxiway. Use caution and vigilance, and ensure you do not run over taxiway lights
(see Attachment 6).

                               VEHICLE CALL SIGN LISTING

A24.1. Vehicle / Pedestrian Call Signs. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians operating on the
runway/CMA must use a distinct call sign coordinated by the wing ADPM to avoid duplicating
and confusing names. Call signs will consist of a code word and may have a numerical suffix
attached. Note: Do not use a call sign that is also a part of air traffic control phraseology such as
TAXI. The following call signs are routinely used on the aerodrome:
