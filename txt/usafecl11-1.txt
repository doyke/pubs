1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection and assess-
ment. As a minimum, units should use USAFE inspection checklists in conjunction with the annual Unit
Self Assessment. The objective is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabili-
ties. Units can supplement this publication to add internal compliance items. Users may add any item that,
in the exercise of good judgment, requires examination. This directory may be used in whole or in part by
higher headquarters during visits or exercises.
    1.1. Core Compliance Guide Items (CCGI) and Compliance Guide Items (CGI). Items identi-
    fied by functional managers to prioritize command requirements and to allow the Inspector General
    (HQ USAFE/IG) inspectors to assess criticality of deficiencies.
       1.1.1. CCGI. Items identified by HQ USAFE directorates and functional managers as key result
       areas for successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to, items where non-com-
       pliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, litigation or affect system reliabil-
       ity. These requirements may be mandated by law, Executive Order, Department of Defense (DoD)
       directive, safety or Air Force and USAFE strategic plans. CCGIs are referred to as significant
       guide items requiring direct IG evaluation. Identify CCGIs by using uppercase, and bold letters.
       1.1.2. CGI. CGI are areas that require special vigilance and are important to the overall perfor-
       mance of the unit. Noncompliance could result in some negative impact on mission performance
       but is not likely to result in injury, unnecessary cost, or litigation. Identify CGIs by using standard
       sentence case.

2. Applicability. All items on this inspection guide are assigned an applicability code designating to
which type of unit the item applies. Applicability code 3 designates the following main operating bases:
Aviano, Incirlik, Lakenheath, Mildenhall, Ramstein, and Spangdahlem. Applicability code 4 designates
Air Support Operations Group (ASOG), including associated Air Support Operations Squadron (ASOS).
Applicability code 7 designates Keflavik.
