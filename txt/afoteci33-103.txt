1. Requirements. Requirements arise from a deficiency in an existing operational capability, a
need for a new capability, or an opportunity to replace or modernize an existing system with
improved technology when operationally and economically practical. Solutions to these
requirements must be compatible with DoD, Joint Service, Air Force, MAJCOM and base
Information Technology (IT) systems architecture, templates, blueprints and plans. Specific
solutions must also align with AF Enterprise IT standards, or meet exception requirements.
Current and future AFOTEC capabilities are planned and defined in the AFOTEC Information
Technology Strategic Plan (ITSP).

2. Requirements Governance. The AFOTEC requirements governance process is established
through the Information Technology Requirements Board (ITRB), Information Technology
Working Group (ITWG), implemented as governed by the ITSP and managed cradle-to-grave
through the Lifecycle Replacement Plan (LCRP).

2.1. Information Technology Requirements Board (ITRB): AFOTEC’s quarterly forum to
review and discuss IT requirements with representation from the Directorates and Detachments.
The ITRB manages changes, additions and deletions to AFOTEC communications and
information technology systems, including new requirements for commercial off-the-shelf
(COTS) and government off-the-shelf (GOTS) software, hardware, or telecommunications
services as well as requests for modification of standard AFOTEC configurations. ITRB
governance extends to both networked and stand-alone systems. The ITRB, in close
coordination with the ITWG, ensures participative organizational planning, sharing of IT
resources and exploiting of related synergies when feasible and cost effective. Both forums are
used as catalysts to promote a centralized and proactive, headquarters-wide focus to address
pertinent IT issues and concerns. The board provides all Directorates/Detachments the
opportunity to review all requirements submitted to A6 for processing.

2.1.1. IT requirements categories:

2.1.1.1. Software

2.1.1.2. Hardware

2.1.1.3. Commercial/long-haul circuits

2.1.1.4. Personal wireless communications systems

2.1.1.5. Video telecommunications (VTC)

2.1.1.6. Other

2.1.2. ITRB membership: Detachment Commanders, Directors and the Director of Staff will
designate primary and alternate representatives for the ITRB. All Directorate/Detachment
representatives will participate in each ITRB meeting to ensure AFOTEC-wide visibility of IT
requirements.
AFOTECI 33-103 6 AUGUST 2013                                                                     3



2.1.3. Subject-matter experts (SME): The following AFOTEC SMEs will participate to provide
technical assistance and guidance during requirements review:

2.1.3.1. Special Access Programs IT Team (A3Z)

2.1.3.2. Client Systems Support Team (A6O)

2.1.3.3. Mission Applications Team (A6M)

2.1.3.4. Cyber Security Team (A6O)

2.1.3.5. Knowledge Operations Management (KOM) Team (A6M)

2.1.3.6. Asset Management Team (A6M)

2.1.3.7. Collateral and SAP Security Team (CVI)

2.1.3.8. Special Security Officer (SSO)/Deputy (A2/9N)

2.2. Information Technology Working Group (ITWG): AFOTEC’s A6 forum that meets weekly
as needed to filter requirements for ITRB process consideration. The ITWG is attended by key
A6 representatives as determined by the Mission Support Division Chief (A6M). The ITWG
will determine whether requirements align with SAF/CIO IT Enterprise guidance and whether a
certification and accreditation (C&A) package will be required based on the recommendations of
the Operations Division (A6O).

2.3. Information Technology Strategic Plan (ITSP): The ITSP shapes current and future
AFOTEC IT processes and capabilities by planning and defining IT requirements. It identifies
priorities as it relates to supporting the AFOTEC Mission with IT. The ITSP is implemented
through the ITRB process and will be reviewed annually and updated as determined by the
AFOTEC/A6.

2.4. Lifecycle Replacement Plan (LCRP): The LCRP implements the lifecycle management
plan (LCMP, IAW AFI 33-112) and identifies IT resources that have reached projected life
expectancy and are replaced in a systematic coordinated way to assure modern, updated and
current IT resources are available to the AFOTEC customer base. The LCRP provides the
systematic replacement schedule and minimizes budget and operational risks that can arise from
inadequate planning. The LCRP is a living document and will be updated as determined by the
AFOTEC/A6. The LCRP replacement guidelines will be annotated in the ITSP.

3. Requirements Processing Procedures. The requester identifies IT requirements using the
electronic Communication Systems Requirement Document (eCSRD), accessible on the
AFOTEC IT Requirements and ITRB website at https://afotec.eis.af.mil/com/it-
requirements/default.aspx. The eCSRD facilitates the allocation of resources to satisfy AFOTEC
IT requirements. Anyone within AFOTEC can submit an IT requirement, but it must be
4                                                       AFOTECI 33-103 6 AUGUST 2013

approved by their respective Director, Deputy, or Detachment Commander. Operating Locations
(OL) will submit their eCSRDs through the appropriate Detachment or Headquarters sponsor.
Forward requirements to the AFOTEC IT Requirements organizational email account
(afotec.requirements@kirtland.af.mil) for a technical solution, broad-gauge costing and
subsequent implementation.

3.1. Once an IT requirement is submitted to A6, the requirements manager will:

3.1.1. Review the eCSRD for completeness and accuracy of information. If information is
missing or incomplete, the requirements manager will contact the requester for the needed
information.

3.1.2. Assign a control number for tracking purposes.

3.1.3. Coordinate with the customer.

3.1.4. Staff to appropriate SME to obtain an initial technical solution and broad-gauge costing.

3.1.5. Once returned from the SME, bring the requirement to ITWG. The ITWG will review
SME recommendations, determine if the requirement meets AF IT Standards, and determine the
delegation approval authority level. The delegation approval levels are as follows:

3.1.5.1. CV: Anything over $25K.

3.1.5.2. A6 Director: Anything over $10K but not to exceed $25K.

3.1.5.3. A6 Deputy Director: Anything over $2.5K, but not to exceed $10K.

3.1.5.4. A6M Division Chief: Anything up to $2.5K.

3.1.6. Return requirements to the requesting organization, typically within 10 duty days of
receipt for implementation. If the requirement is not approved, it will be returned to the
requester for revision.

3.1.7. The requirements manager will document all processed IT requirements in the ITRB
minutes at least quarterly.

3.2. The SMEs will:

3.2.1. Review the requirement for technical feasibility and alignment with Air Force Enterprise
IT standards.

3.2.2. Review recommended solution if provided and make concur/non-concur recommendation.
The SMEs will ensure the request aligns with SAF/CIO IT Enterprise guidance.
AFOTECI 33-103 6 AUGUST 2013                                                                         5

3.2.3. Provide a solution if none is provided. If a solution is provided, ensure it aligns with
SAF/CIO guidance. If the requirement does not align with SAF/CIO IT enterprise guidance,
work with the requester to develop a solution that does align with SAF/CIO guidance.

3.2.4. Respond back to the requirements manager within five duty days.

3.3. The requester will:

3.3.1. Determine if requirement is funded at requester’s organization level, or unfunded (HQ
support needed) and mark eCSRD appropriately. Potential funding sources may include:

3.3.1.1. Funded: program specific 3600 funds.

3.3.1.2. Unfunded: A6 ITRB 3400 funds, or A4/7 3400/3600 funds.

3.3.2. Once the requirement is approved and funds become available, procure IAW headquarters
or local procedures and through the sources documented on the eCSRD. The purchasing
organization maintains all records of IT requirement purchases. If A6 or A4/7 funds are used,
A6 will procure and monitor until completed. If program specific funds are used, the requester
will procure and monitor until completed.

3.4. An eCSRD is not required for the following:

3.4.1. When replacing equipment that is part of the AFOTEC Standard Member IT Baseline as
defined in the ITSP and the equipment is readily available on hand.

3.4.2. When replacing unmanaged peripheral devices, such as mice, keyboards and CAC
readers.

3.4.3. When purchasing supply items such as printer cartridges, toner, projector light bulbs, etc.

3.5. Validation of a requirement is separate from the procurement process. Once the
requirement is approved by the approving authority, it is the responsibility of the requester to
begin the procurement process. The procurement should be initiated within 90 days of approval.
If the approved solution is not purchased within 12 months, the requirement and technical
solution must be revalidated by the ITRB. This will enable financial planners to project future
expenditures.

4. Responsibilities.

4.1. Vice Commander (CV) will:

4.1.1. Appoint the communications systems officer (CSO) in writing.

4.1.2. Approve IT expenditures over $25K.
