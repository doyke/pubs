Supersedes AMCR 76-2, 1 August 1992.                                                       Pages: 4

This instruction implements AMCPD 24-1, Military Airlift, to provide a system for cargo load planning
in preparation for airlift operations. It establishes standards, responsibilities, and procedures for produc-
tion, distribution, and use of the AMC Cargo Load Planning Template System. It applies to all organiza-
tions involved in load planning for contingency operations. It also applies to Air National Guard (ANG)
and US Air Force Reserve (USAFR) units.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision deletes AMC Form 570, Army/Marine General Purpose Vehicle Load Planning Tem-
plate



1. General. In conjunction with DD Form 2130-XX series manifests, the Cargo Load Planning Template
System provides a means of load planning cargo for individual aircraft. This system graphically depicts
the location of individual pieces of equipment in the aircraft. When complete, DD Form 2130-XX series
validates weight and balance computations and identifies the order in which cargo and equipment will be
sequenced in the a ircraft. DoD 4500.32R, Military Standard Transportation and Movement Procedures
(MILSTAMP), establishes procedures for manifesting cargo for unit moves during exercise or contingency
operations.

2. Policies. The following general policies apply:
   2.1. Individual figures on each template form are to the scale of 1/4-inch equals 3 feet.
   2.2. Individual figures may be used on any cargo manifest to the same scale.
   2.3. Reproduction of these forms is not authorized. EXCEPTION: Once individual figures have been
   placed on DD Form 2130-XX cargo manifest in their final arrangement, reproduction of the entire
   form for required distribution is authorized.
2                                                                      AMCI24-103 11 December 1995

    2.4. It is the users' responsibility to ensure indivi dual figures accurately depict characteristics and
    placement of the cargo being load planned.

3. Changes. Recommendations for changes or additions to templates should be submitted to HQ AMC/
DOOM, 402 Scott Drive Unit 3AI, Scott AFB EL, 62225-5302, All changes or additions must include a
1/4 inch to 3 feet scale drawing and associated measurements, These measurements must indicate overall
length, width, height, axle or tread placement, individual axle weights, and both empty and loaded centers
of balance.
