                                           Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. General. This instruction formally establishes AFMC mission monitoring policy for all
AFMC flying units accomplishing assigned missions overseas (OCONUS), missions of an
unusual nature, and missions involving Distinguished Visitors (DVs).
1.2. Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is to provide HQ AFMC Close Watch procedures.
These procedures are designed to 1) provide AFMC senior leadership the status of these
missions, 2) support units engaged in these missions, and 3) provide processes and procedures to
those involved in the mission monitoring function.
1.3. Terms and Explanations.
     1.3.1. AFMC Close Watch Mission. Defined as an unusual mission, an AFMC OCONUS
     mission, or when a DV is onboard TT2.
        1.3.1.1. Unusual missions are those missions that are designated as unusual or require a
        waiver, both instances by HQ AFMC/A3. Waivered missions are usually, but not always
        for a “one-time flight.” See AFI 11-202V1 AFMC Sup 1 for more information about
        one-time flights and the associated waiver procedures. Use ALC Delivery Procedures as
        outlined in Chapter 3, regardless of whether the mission is OCONUS or CONUS.
        1.3.1.2. OCONUS Missions are missions that may originate from the continental United
        States (CONUS), but transit or terminate outside of the CONUS.
        1.3.1.3. DV Missions are missions where a DV is on board an AFMC possessed aircraft,
        CONUS or OCONUS.
     1.3.2. Global Decision Support System 2 (GDSS2). System primarily used by Air Mobility
     Command (AMC) Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) to maintain C2 of AMC and AMC
     gained missions. The purpose of adding AFMC OCONUS missions of the DV and Mobility
     Aircraft Delivery variety to GDSS2 is not for C2. It is to allow AMC visibility of the
     mission in case the aircraft movement experiences a breakdown enroute to its final
     destination. This will help AMC to know where possible critical parts need to be sent in
     order to get the mission moving again.
     1.3.3. Flight Monitoring. The function of collecting enroute mission information and
     providing status of Close Watch missions during execution.
     1.3.4. HQ AFMC Operations Duty Officer (ODO). Officer or civilian member of
     AFMC/A3 with Air Force flight operations experience. A primary and alternate ODO will
     be assigned each day/non-duty day. The ODO is responsible to follow the progress of on-
     going Close Watch missions, report progress and/or delays/maintenance problems to
     AFMC/A3 Director or designated alternate.
1.4. Mobility Aircraft Delivery Requirements.
     1.4.1. AFMC forces perform a wide variety of missions and operate in all theaters. Missions
     may include OCONUS test, OCONUS delivery of Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM),
     unusual missions, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) aircraft or DV airlift. Having maximum
AFMCI11-207 9 MAY 2012                                                                         3


   visibility of all AFMC flights ensures HQ AFMC ability to provide assistance when and
   where needed.
       1.4.1.1. AFMC units flying mobility type aircraft will use GDSS2 to assist in tracking all
       Close Watch missions to the maximum extent possible. This includes those with DV
       passengers to allow AMC visibility for unexpected contingency support. By allowing
       AMC visibility through the GDSS2 system, spare parts or alternate airlift if needed, can
       be obtained more efficiently.
          1.4.1.1.1. TACC/XOCZF: Flight Plans Branch also supports USAFE, PACAF, and
          other DOD agencies. Aircrews flying AMC gained aircraft 450 NM or greater, that
          are not flight-managed can expect Computerized Flight Plans (CFPs) 6-8 hours prior
          to scheduled departure at the en route C2 facility (contact XOCZF for exceptions).
          XOCZF provides CFPs for both tankers and receivers on air refueling missions,
          however, AR missions utilizing ALTRVs are normally provided CFPs from 618
          TACC/XOOK or unit planners. XOCZF can develop AR flight plans requiring an
          ALTRV, however a minimum of 48 to 72 hours prior coordination is required.
          AMCI 11-208, Chapter 6 provides detailed guidance and responsibilities on obtaining
          flight plan support. TACC/XOCZF can be reached at DSN 779-4977, Comm. (618)
          229-4977, FAX: DSN 779-0154, E-mail: TACC.XOCZF@scott.af.mil
       1.4.1.2. AFMC units flying mobility type aircraft other than TT2 will utilize TACC
       capabilities for flight plans and diplomatic clearances.
       1.4.1.3. 412th FLTS (TT2) crews normally will utilize organic capabilities for flight
       plans and diplomatic clearances, but will obtain TACC assistance when necessary.
       1.4.1.4. 412th FLTS will provide a fund cite to TACC to enable quick reaction for
       obtaining parts when TT2 is broken down enroute to its destination.
1.5. Fighter Aircraft Delivery Requirements.
   1.5.1. For fighter aircraft OCONUS delivery of PDM or FMS aircraft, crews are required to
   coordinate with ACC AOS for Coronet mission planning, diplomatic clearances and
   execution.
       1.5.1.1. Instructions for ACC AOS coordination can be found in AFI 11-207, Combat
       Aircraft Delivery.
   1.5.2. ACC AOS requires as much advance forecasting of fighter aircraft delivery as
   possible (30 days minimum notice desired). This enables them to coordinate tankers support
   for the OCONUS coronets with AMC.
   1.5.3. Unusual missions as defined in paragraph 1.3.1.1 will be considered Close Watch
   Mission.
1.6. Unit Command Post Reporting. All AFMC Command Posts (CP) to include the AFMC
Command Center will maintain the ability to access missions in GDSS2. The purpose is not for
C2. C2 can be handled by the AFMC CPs and the AFMC Command Center without this tool.
The underlying purpose is to be able to assist AMC in getting spare parts to a broken-down
aircraft while enroute to its destination.

     1.6.1. Unit CPs with an active AFMC OCONUS flying mission to include a DV mission will
     submit all morning reports to the AFMC Command Center, via email to
     HQAFMC.Command.Center@wpafb.af.mil, by 1200Z daily, utilizing format in
     Attachment 3. Takeoff and landing reports will be submitted to the AFMC Command Center
     as the mission dictates; within one hour for DV missions and two hours for all other
     missions. Note any problems or changes to itinerary.
        1.6.1.1. All AFMC Center or Air Base Wing CPs will support all flying units on their
        base that have an AFMC flying mission, regardless if the flying unit is Active Duty,
        Guard or Reserve.
1.7. AFMC Command Center Reporting.
     1.7.1. AFMC Command Center will forward all takeoff, landing, and status reports for all
     AFMC possessed aircraft flying missions that go OCONUS to the HQ AFMC ODO.
1.8. AFMC ODO Reporting.
     1.8.1. The AFMC ODO, as necessary, will build and submit the AFMC DV Mission slide
     for the AFMC Commander Staff Meetings to AFMC Presentations at
     AFMC.Presentations@wpafb.af.mil and a copy to the Director of Air, Space and
     Information Operations (HQ AFMC/A3) at HQAFMC.A3.EXEC@wpafb.af.mil.
     1.8.2. The AFMC ODO, as directed by the AFMC/A3 Director, will build and submit a slide
     depicting OCONUS missions for PDM or FMS deliveries or AFMC test missions to
     HQAFMC.A3.EXEC@wpafb.af.mil, and will courtesy copy all AFMC Command Posts for
     C2 visibility.
     1.8.3. The AFMC ODO will notify AFMC/A3 Director or designated alternate of takeoffs,
     landing, changes to planned itinerary or maintenance problems for all OCONUS missions.
     1.8.4. The ODO will update the designated AFMC/A4 representative of maintenance
     problems as soon as practicable.
     1.8.5. HQ AFMC/A3OA is responsible for building, distributing to the AFMC Command
     Center, and executing, the monthly AFMC ODO schedule.
1.9. Communications Security. Communications security is a joint responsibility of the
aircrew executing the mission and all agencies accessing mission information. All details about
DV flights are treated as “FOUO,” and only those people with a specific need to know will have
access to mission information. Never combine the DV name/title with the mission itinerary on
unclassified media. For more detailed information, refer to AFI 10-205, Availability of Key HQ
AF Personnel and Major Command Commanders.

5.1. General. This chapter outlines the procedures required for HQ AFMC to monitor
OCONUS test missions flown by any AFMC flying unit.
5.2. Mission Planning.
   5.2.1. All AFMC Flight Test Squadrons (FLTSs) will forecast OCONUS test missions to
   HQ AFMC/A3O 30 days prior to test execution.
   5.2.2. Units will formalize their forecasted OCONUS test mission (see paragraph 5.2.1) with
   an initial notification of the mission to HQ AFMC/A3O two weeks prior to mission
   execution.
          5.2.3. Use the AFMC OCONUS Mission Itineraries form (Attachment 2).
          5.2.3.1. Forward the form to AFMC/A3O at AFMC.A3O.Workflow@wpafb.af.mil
          no later than seven days prior to execution of the OCONUS mission.
5.3. Mission Execution.
   5.3.1. The Aircraft Commander (AC) or designated representative will report takeoff and
   land times and mission/aircraft status to their unit CP within two hours of takeoff or landing.
   5.3.2. If there will be delays in the mission, the AC will notify their unit CP at the earliest
   opportunity of delay reason and new estimated takeoff and/or land time and any changes to
   scheduled itinerary.
   5.3.3. The unit CP supporting the delivery mission will adhere to reporting guidelines in
   paragraph 1.6
   5.3.4. The AFMC Command Center will flight monitor the OCONUS mission IAW
   paragraph 1.7
       5.3.4.1. If the AFMC Command Center has not received a takeoff or land time report
       within two hours of scheduled, the Command Center will query the unit using the AFMC
       OCONUS Mission Itineraries form contact information.
NOTE: If the OCONUS mission’s status cannot be ascertained, initiate overdue aircraft
procedures as outlined in AFI 13-202 Overdue Aircraft.
   5.3.5. The AFMC ODO will keep the HQ AFMC/A3 or his designated representative
   informed per procedures outlined in 1.8
 12                                                                AFMCI11-207 9 MAY 2012



NOTE: Any unit (including AFRC units) supporting the AFMC mission from any airfield
without a CP presence, will forward all takeoff, landing, and status reports to the next CP in the
chain of command. If the next echelon does not have a supporting CP, send the reports directly
to the AFMC Command Center. If the mission starts or terminates in an austere location, contact
the AFMC Command Center directly via HF/UHF/VHF phone patch. DCMA aircrews will
report through their CMO (Contract Management Office) via email to:
HQAFMC.Command.Center@wpafb.af.mil
