        AS/CC, 914 AES/CC, SEFEs, Flying Safety Officer, Flying Training Officer and any
        other personnel deemed necessary by the 914 OG/CC. 914 OGV personnel from
        each crew position will gather and post data to the SEB shell located on the shared
        drive in the 914 OG/OGV SEB Process Guide folder. This data will come from
        several sources including but not limited to: PEX, trends, instructor meetings,
        supplementary evaluations, etc. Inputs will be made no later than one week prior to
        the scheduled SEB. This process is divided into scheduling, publishing the agenda,
        preparing the SEB slideshow and the writing and distributing of the SEB minutes.

                      AIRCREW QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes aircrew qualification evaluations to
ensure qualification of aircrew members and supplementary evaluations to ensure
standardization of operations.
   5.1.1. To promote efficient use of flying resources, accomplish aircrew qualification
   evaluations concurrently, whenever practical.
   5.1.2. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM supplements.
   For specialized aircrew, see Chapter 8. For guidance on supplementary evaluations, see
   Chapter 9.
5.2. Categories. Aircrew qualification evaluations are divided into five categories
(Qualification (QUAL), Instrument (INSTM), Mission (MSN), Instructor (INSTR), and SPOT)
each consisting of two structured phases, ground and flight. (EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations
may consist of either a ground or flight phase.) Each phase requires the completion of requisite
tasks (see paragraph 5.5). (EXCEPTION: a SPOT evaluation has no requisite tasks.)
   5.2.1. QUAL Evaluations.
       5.2.1.1. Purpose. Ensure basic qualification in an MDS and/or crew position.
       5.2.1.2. Execution. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their
       primary assigned aircraft/crew position as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol
       2. QUAL evaluations may be combined with INSTM and/or MSN evaluations IAW AFI
       11-2MDS, Vol 2. See Chapter 8 for specialized aircrew.
   5.2.2. INSTM Evaluations.
       5.2.2.1. Purpose. Obtain/maintain instrument qualification in order to operate under
       Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
       5.2.2.2. Execution. All USAF pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with the
       USAF, e.g., exchange pilots) will obtain/maintain instrument qualification by
       successfully completing a periodic INSTM evaluation.
           5.2.2.2.1. EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI
           11-401, Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft
           pilots; T-41/51/52 pilots.
           5.2.2.2.2. Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be assigned to other
           aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification, but will take their
           INSTM checkride in the non-excepted aircraft.
           5.2.2.2.3. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification will not fly
           under IFR except under supervised status in a training program leading to
           requalification. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed above.)
   5.2.3. MSN Evaluations.
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                        23

     AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.1. EXCEPTION: The requirement for a MSN evaluation may be waived for
        those aircraft where performance of normal operational, test, and training sorties
        involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM and/or QUAL
        evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Document waiver via memorandum
        for record (MFR) to be included in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2. HQ
        USAF/A3O-A approval is not required for such waivers. Specify approval
        procedures in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction or in the applicable AFI 11-
        2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.2. The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required
        in fulfillment of the aircraft’s operational or DOC statement missions.
  5.2.4. INSTR Evaluations.
     5.2.4.1. Purpose. To qualify aircrew as instructors in their weapon system/crew position
     by focusing primarily on the examinees instructional ability.

     current and qualified Air Force instructors does not exist to accomplish initial unit
     instructor qualification, with MAJCOM/A3 approval and Lead MAJCOM/A3
     coordination the OG/CC may establish an Initial cadre (minimum required for initial
     conversion) of flight instructors who do not require an INIT INSTR evaluation. Initial
     cadre must be current and qualified instructors in a US Air Force aircraft who will remain
     in the same crew position on the new aircraft. OG/CCs will notify MAJCOMs and
     provide initial cadre list for each crew position with current qualification and total flight
     and instructor hours. OG/CCs will use discretion when establishing initial cadre
     instructors and consider availability of suitable instructor courses. See also paragraph
     5.13.
        5.2.4.2.1. Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions
        whenever possible. When students are not available or mission/crew composition
        requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator will
        serve as the student.
        5.2.4.2.2. Evaluations of instructor qualification will be conducted during all
        subsequent periodic evaluations.
24                                        AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011


         5.2.4.2.3. Instructors who expire on their INSTM, QUAL, and/or MSN checkrides
         evaluations are not qualified to instruct in those areas (e.g. if an IP expires on his/her
         MSN zone, he/she may still instruct in INSTM/QUAL-related areas as specified in
         AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2).
  5.2.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional).
     5.2.5.1. Purpose. Evaluate a specific event or requirement without intending to satisfy
     the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial INSTR evaluation.
     5.2.5.2. Execution. A SPOT has no specific requisites, unless specified in MAJCOM
     supplements, but may be No Notice IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.
         5.2.5.2.1. An examinee may utilize a SPOT evaluation to update a
         QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
         evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.8 (document on
         the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.1. OG/CCs may authorize additional flights in order to help the aircrew
            accomplish periodic requirements (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph
            7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.2. When the flight examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not
            qualified in the MDS (e.g. a Senior flight examiner), the evaluation will not be
            credited towards a periodic evaluation.
     5.2.5.3. Any qualifying event and/or evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through
     5.2.4 will be documented as a SPOT evaluation.
  5.2.6. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe
  the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through 5.2.5:
     5.2.6.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type, to include instructor
     qualification, in a specific weapon system/crew position (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT
     MSN, INIT INSTR).
     5.2.6.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
     qualification due to:
         5.2.6.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The recheck will be IAW the
         guidance for that periodic evaluation.
         5.2.6.2.2. Loss of currency that requires a requal evaluation (IAW AFI11-2MDS Vol
         1). In this case RQ SPOT will be used for documentation (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2).
         The recheck profile will be as directed by the SQ/CC and will include, as a minimum,
         those items for which the individual is non-current.
         5.2.6.2.3. A flight recheck following a failed periodic evaluation. The recheck will be
         IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.6.1.
         5.2.6.2.4. Loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
         paragraph 5.9). The recheck profile will be as directed by the commander on the AF
         Form 8/8a (see paragraph 7.4).
         5.2.6.2.5. The RQ prefix will not be used under the following circumstances:
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       25


            5.2.6.2.5.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
            complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.5.1), but the
            flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period and
            the OG/CC determines that qualification will be re-established by completion of
            the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight evaluation.
            5.2.6.2.5.2. To prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
            qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
     5.2.6.3. No-Notice (N/N).
        5.2.6.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
        daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
        5.2.6.3.1. (914AW) The 914 OGV in coordination with the OG/CC and SQ/CC will
        conduct an in-flight N/N Evaluation Program as a method for assessing overall unit
        readiness as well as providing indicators for the effectiveness of unit training.
        Detailed program administration procedures are located in 914 OG Process Guide F.
        5.2.6.3.2. A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the
        evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. ―Normal
        preparation‖ will be as defined in the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        5.2.6.3.2. (914AW) Crewmembers can anticipate an N/N evaluation at any time a
        flight is generated. The N/N notification period is when the examinee is notified at or
        after the beginning of normal preparation for a mission, normally at the Ops Sup brief
        time. This should occur no earlier than crewmember show time and will not be
        published on the weekly flying schedule.
        5.2.6.3.3. (Added-914AW) Administering an N/N evaluation within the eligibility
        period should be avoided unless directed by the commander.           The OGV
        representative is responsible for ensuring an individual scheduled for an N/N
        evaluation is not in their eligibility window by checking either PEX or the
        individual’s FEF.
        5.2.6.3.4. (Added-914AW) Crew members should not receive more than one N/N
        (or SPOT) evaluation per calendar year except as directed by the commander.
        5.2.6.3.5. (Added-914AW) The examinee may elect to update a INSTM/QUAL and
        MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requisites and requirements for the
        evaluation are completed within the prescribed time frame IAW AFI 11-
        202V2_AMCSUP_1, Para. 5.2.7.2. Subsequent flights are authorized to complete
        required events. If the examinee elects not to update their evaluations, the evaluation
        will be documented as an N/N SPOT.
        5.2.6.3.6. (Added-914AW) The 914 OG N/N goals are to conduct a minimum of
        15% of available crewmembers annually. The required amount of No Notices’ to be
        administered will be determined at the January SEB.
        5.2.6.3.7. (Added-914AW) Evaluators will use the Special Interest Items and
        Trends to target and assess specific areas during all N/N evaluations. All MAJCOM
        and local Special Interest Items will be presented during the Operations Supervisor
        briefing. Also, the SIIs can be found in the FCB and the SII binder located under the
 26                                       AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011


          Ops Sup counter. Additional areas include commander, directed areas or topics
          deemed appropriate by any of the following: 328 AS/CC, 914 AES/CC and 914
          OG/CC. Results of the evaluations, and completion rates for the year, will be reported
          at the next R & C and/or SEB, and included in the minutes as appropriate.
          5.2.6.3.8. (Added-914AW) Individuals receiving an N/N evaluation will be tracked
          by their respective Stan/Eval representative on the 914 OGV Stan/Eval Tracker to
          avoid receiving more than one N/N or SPOT evaluation per calendar year.
          Additionally, the crewmember’s FEF will be reviewed prior to administering An N/N
          evaluation. Upon completion of the N/N evaluation, the results will be entered into
          the appropriate flight evaluation log. The 3862s/Form 8’s for N/N evaluations are
          processed through PEX the same way as for scheduled evaluations, including trend
          data.
          5.2.6.3.9. (Added-914AW) Minimum requirements for N/N are as those specified in
          AFI 11-202V2, Para 5.2.3.3 and General Area’ of the AF IMT 3862. Specific
          requirements will be at the discretion of the examiner, or as specified by OGV,
          applicable to the target sortie, in order to meet the intent of the evaluation (example:
          commander directed N/N requirements).
          5.2.6.3.10. (Added-914AW) The beginning of ―normal preparation‖ for the mission
          is defined as ―show time‖ for the Ops Sup briefing.
      5.2.6.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
      in a simulator and/or suitable ATD as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
      5.2.6.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
      (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
      evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the
      evaluation) will be explained on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.
5.3. Grading System.
   5.3.1. A two step grading system is used to evaluate and document aircrew performance.
      5.3.1.1. In the first step, individual grades are assigned to each evaluation requisite to
      include the grading of areas/subareas of aircrew performance against established
      evaluation criteria (see paragraph 5.4). Performance less than fully qualified must be
      documented.
      5.3.1.2. In the second step, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a
      compilation of all individual requisite grades (see paragraph 5.3.3.4).
   5.3.2. Performance Areas/Subareas.
      5.3.2.1. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading system.
      Discrepancies will be documented against the established areas/subareas.
          5.3.2.1.1. Q indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of
          all required information and performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
          tolerances.
          5.3.2.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
          tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                     27


        examiner. Deviations must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances, jeopardize flight
        safety, or be a breach of flight discipline.
        5.3.2.1.3. U indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters thereby
        compromising flight safety, that deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
        adversely affected mission accomplishment, and/or evaluated performance
        constituted a breach of flight discipline. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade
        of U requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the flight
        examiner.
     5.3.2.2. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or U require remedial action that includes
     either debriefing discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training.
        5.3.2.2.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of
        the evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides instruction concerning the
        discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
        proficiency.
        5.3.2.2.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by the flight examiner to
        remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
        5.3.2.2.2. (914AW) Make additional training recommendations to the 328 AS/CC or
        914 AES/CC as required.
            5.3.2.2.2.1. May include self-study, ground instruction, use of a simulator/ATD
            or flying.
            5.3.2.2.2.1. (914AW) For all evaluations graded less than Q1, the SEFE will
            complete a Notice of Flight Action Status immediately following the evaluation.
            The status form will be distributed to the appropriate office and placed in the
            member’s FEF. The Notice of Flight Action Status form will be shredded when
            the applicable Form 8 is completed, signed, and placed in the member’s FEF. If
            the overall grade is Q-3, an OGV representative will submit an AF Form 4324.
            The SEFE will discuss with the Squadron Commander/Director of Operations the
            proposed recommended action. The SEFE will place the original temporary flight
            evaluation certificate in the individual’s Flight Evaluation Folder and brief the
            senior OGV representative or the individual’s supervisor. The OGV
            representative will update the 914AW Ground/Restricted Status Update List
            maintained at the Ops Sup desk. Training will be reviewed to determine
            adequacy at the one and two month gates during the Review and Certification
            Board if required. Additional training must be accomplished by the end of the
            third month following the event. When retraining is complete, 328 AS/DOT or
            914 AES/DOT will forward completed training information back to OGV for
            Form 8 completion or a requalification check as required.
            5.3.2.2.2.2. Will be complete by the last day of the third month following the date
            of the discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 12, additional training must
            be accomplished by 30 Apr 12).
            5.3.2.2.2.3. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of
            additional training, the SQ/CC will review the situation and direct appropriate
28                                       AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011


             action. Document the circumstances with an MFR to be included in the AF Form
             8/8a (see paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
             5.3.2.2.2.4. Document additional training on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs
             7.3.5.6 and 7.3.7.3.4.
     5.3.2.3. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as ―required‖ in the
     general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.3.2.4. In addition to required areas/subareas, the flight examiner will grade any
     area/subarea observed during an evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts
     the specific evaluation accomplished or overall flight safety.
     5.3.2.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.
     5.3.2.6. Minor momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies
     prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider
     cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
     5.3.2.7. The flight examiner may further identify any area/sub-area as ―Commendable‖
     if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional
     skill and knowledge. Document IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.2.
  5.3.3. Qualification Levels. Qualification levels are assigned both to individual evaluations
  (i.e. flight evals and EPEs) as well as overall performance. Individual evaluations are graded
  as a compilation of all area/sub-area grades. Overall performance is graded as a compilation
  of all requisite tasks associated with the required evaluation. Both individual and overall
  grades are based on the following.
     5.3.3.1. Q1. The aircrew member demonstrated desired performance and knowledge of
     procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the grading criteria.
     This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted, but may be awarded when
     discrepancies are noted if:
         5.3.3.1.1. No U grades were awarded for any discrepancy area/sub-area.
         5.3.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
         awarding of an overall Q1.
         5.3.3.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were cleared during
         the debrief of that evaluation.
     5.3.3.2. Q2. The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to perform duties safely, but:
         5.3.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
         assigned.
         5.3.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
         5.3.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q2 may be given if there is
         justification based on Q- performance in one or several areas/subareas.
     5.3.3.3. Q3. The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety,
     performance or knowledge.
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       29


          5.3.3.3.1. Any critical area graded U requires an overall Q3 (applicable to both flight
          evaluations and EPEs).
          5.3.3.3.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q3 may be given if there is
          justification based on Q-/U performance in one or several non-critical areas/subareas.
       5.3.3.4. Assigning the overall qualification level.
          5.3.3.4.1. The flight-phase flight examiner is the examiner responsible for assigning
          the overall qualification level.
          5.3.3.4.2. An overall grade of Q1 or Q2 will be given only after all evaluation
          requirements (to include requisite examinations) have been completed and given due
          consideration.
          5.3.3.4.3. An overall grade of Q3 may be awarded at any time.
          5.3.3.4.4. While AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may dictate the highest grade for a flight or
          EPE based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will
          always be the determining factor in deciding the overall grade.
       5.3.3.5. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. An EQ may be given, but will
       only be applied to the overall grade - not to separate requisites. Document on the AF
       Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.2. An EQ may be given when:
          5.3.3.5.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
          all phases of the evaluation;
          5.3.3.5.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
          5.3.3.5.3. The aircrew member received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated.
5.4. Evaluation Criteria.
   5.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs, in coordination with the applicable user MAJCOMs, will establish
   and maintain standardized INSTM, MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluation criteria in the
   appropriate AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Lead MAJCOMs will coordinate with the program
   managers of any command-mandated software on any updates of eval criteria to aid in the
   expeditious revision of eval criteria files. Lead MAJCOMs are also responsible for
   coordinating the establishment of the following:
       5.4.1.1. Areas/subareas including the identification of critical areas and those areas
       required for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged into general
       and specific evaluation areas.
          5.4.1.1.1. Critical areas are those areas that, upon failure, would most adversely
          affect the qualification of an aircrew member. Critical areas will include, but are not
          limited to, Airmanship, Safety, and Flight Discipline.
       5.4.1.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Checks. This is required for QUAL
       evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
          5.4.1.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for maintaining required flight
          publications as outlined in applicable AFI11-2MDS volumes.
 30                                       AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011


          5.4.1.2.2. Q performance requires individual flight publications be current and
          properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
          members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
          required for the mission.
       5.4.1.3. An area containing criteria for Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM)
       IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, and
       MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
       5.4.1.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
       and procedures or applicable Host Nation requirements for evaluations administered
       outside of the NAS.
5.5. Requisites. These include both ground and flight phase items. The ground phase, when
required, includes a series of examinations (see Chapter 6) as well as evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment (i.e. EPEs, see paragraph
5.5.1.2). The flight phase includes an in-flight and/or simulator evaluation of aircrew
performance.
   5.5.1. Ground Phase Requisites.
       5.5.1.1. Ground phase requisites for each evaluation include the following.
          5.5.1.1.1. QUAL: Open book examination, closed book examination,
          Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
          5.5.1.1.2. INSTM: Instrument examination
          5.5.1.1.3. MSN: As specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs).
          5.5.1.2.1. Purpose. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs
          and systems for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate mission-specific EPs and tactical
          systems knowledge during MSN evaluations.
          5.5.1.2.2. Execution. AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 will specify contents of EPEs, areas to be
          evaluated, grading criteria, and whether EPEs may be done in-flight, in a
          simulator/ATD, or verbally.
              5.5.1.2.2.1. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for each combined
              evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation).
              5.5.1.2.2.2. A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
              INSTM/QUAL eval) as long as the combined EPE is of a scope and duration to
              cover required areas and is conducted within the requisite zone for each
              evaluation (see paragraph 5.8).
          5.5.1.2.3. Grading. Q1 performance for EPEs requires taking the proper action in
          the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is responsible
          for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
          5.5.1.2.4. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight
          examiner will indicate if the additional training must be accomplished before the next
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                           31


          unsupervised flight (see also paragraph 5.3.2.2.2). Document IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.6
          and 7.3.7.3.4.
          5.5.1.2.5. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP
          situation during an EPE requires an EPE grade of 3 (unqualified). Under these
          circumstances, the examinee will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
          accomplished (either written, verbally, or in a simulator/ATD as determined by the
          flight examiner)
          5.5.1.2.6. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an EPE grade of 3
          (unqualified) will be placed on supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7.
   5.5.2. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
   in the weapon system and/or a suitable simulator/ATD (unless restricted by AFI 11-2MDS
   Vol 2).
       5.5.2.1. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
       appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2, and allow accurate
       measure of the proficiency of the examinee.
       5.5.2.2. Evaluation profiles will be realistic, reflect unit tasking, be consistent with daily
       training missions, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission.
   5.5.3. Requisite Completion.
       5.5.3.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the eligibility period of the
       current evaluation (see paragraph 5.8). The OG/CC may waive this requirement on a
       case-by-case basis (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
       5.5.3.1. (914AW) Requisite examinations should be completed in the first four months
       of the member’s eligibility period. OGV representatives will provide each section
       scheduler an evaluation tracker which will detail individual requisites and flight
       evaluation status to assist in scheduling.
       5.5.3.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations accomplished outside
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period
       beginning with the month in which the first ground requisite or flight evaluation was
       administered, whichever occurs first. EXCEPTION: For extended evaluations (IAW
       paragraph 5.8.3.2), requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
       eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
       5.5.3.3. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of combined
       evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.3.4. Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations
       provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite zone for each
       evaluation.
       5.5.3.5. For aircrew possessing instrument qualifications in multiple aircraft, one
       instrument exam may count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs
       within the zone for each evaluation IAW the paragraphs above.
5.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
 32                                       AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011


5.6. (914AW)Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. For any failed flight evaluation the
evaluator will notify OGV and fill out Notice of Flight Status action checklist.
   5.6.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or ground
   recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure,
   (e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 12, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 12).
      5.6.1.1. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the three-month time limit on a case-by-case
      basis.
          5.6.1.1.1. Document the waiver(s) with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8/8a
          IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
      5.6.1.2. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed during this
      period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and hours of
      training required.
      5.6.1.3. The flight examiner that administered the original check will not normally
      administer the recheck.
      5.6.1.4. A recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q or
      Q-/debriefed criteria for each area graded U.
      5.6.1.5. Ground rechecks may be directed when the flight examiner deems a flight
      recheck unnecessary, but are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of a Q3
      evaluation (document IAW paragraph 7.3.9.2).
      5.6.1.6. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.5.3.1 or 5.5.3.2
      remain valid, IAW the paragraphs above.
   5.6.2. Status Downgrade. Aircrew members receiving a Q3 INSTM, QUAL and/or MSN
   evaluation are non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR)/non-basic
   mission capable(N-BMC)/non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
   For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be downgraded if
   the discrepancies were only in instructor areas/subareas.
   5.6.3. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
   judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
   successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
      5.6.3.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
      requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
          5.6.3.1.1. QUAL Evaluation: Place the examinee on supervised status (see
          paragraph 5.7) in the aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the
          opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For
          specialized, universal, and/or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining qualification for
          similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may direct supervised status in
          all aircraft in which the individual maintains qualification.
          5.6.3.1.2. INSTM Evaluation: Restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
          examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                      33


          5.6.3.1.3. MSN       Evaluation:     The      examinee      may      perform    basic
          qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
          supervised status for mission tasks.
          5.6.3.1.4. INSTR Evaluation (or any evaluation where instructor qualifications are
          being evaluated): Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor
          area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is completed.
      5.6.3.2. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q3 on any evaluation until a successful recheck is
      completed (see paragraph 5.6.1).
      5.6.3.3. If defined in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1 and/or Vol 2, formal schoolhouses will include
      restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a for any core item not accomplished due to training
      limitations, regardless if the method of qualification is by evaluation or instructor
      certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform core items in which they are
      not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. In this case, MDS-
      specific guidance will set the time requirement for completion of additional training.
      5.6.3.4. Document restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.1.
5.7. Supervised Status.
   5.7.1. If unsatisfactory performance or restrictions require an examinee be placed on
   supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be
   determined by the SQ/CC and/or as specified in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1.
   5.7.2. Supervision will only be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors.
5.8. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
   5.8.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th
   month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a periodic
   evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 10 expires on 31 Mar 12.).
   5.8.2. Eligibility Period. Periodic evaluations will be scheduled in the eligibility period,
   defined as the six-month period prior to the expiration date.
   5.8.3. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. On a case-by-case basis, periodic evaluations may be
   scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria:
      5.8.3.1. Evaluations Conducted Prior to the Eligibility Period. SQ/CCs may
      authorize individuals to complete periodic evaluations prior to the eligibility period
      (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
      5.8.3.2. Extended Evaluations.
          5.8.3.2.1. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize blanket
          or group extensions on an as-required basis. Requests for extensions at MAJCOM or
          subordinate levels will be submitted IAW paragraph 1.3.2.
          5.8.3.2.2. MAJCOM-Extended           Evaluations. MAJCOM/A3s        may    extend
          evaluation expiration dates for individual aircrew members on a case-by-case basis
          IAW paragraph 1.3.1. Provide guidance for MAJCOM extensions in MAJCOM
          supplements to this instruction.
 34                                        AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011


           5.8.3.2.3. SQ/CC-Extended Evaluations. SQ/CCs may extend the expiration date
           of periodic evaluations up to three months for the reasons listed below (document
           IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2). Extensions will be on a case-by-case basis and this
           paragraph is not authority to grant blanket extensions. For individual extensions
           longer than three months, see paragraph 5.8.3.2.2. For group or blanket extensions,
           see paragraph 5.8.3.2.1. Requisites not completed during the original eligibility
           period must be completed prior to the extended expiration date.
              5.8.3.2.3.1. PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
              5.8.3.2.3.2. Departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.
              5.8.3.2.3.3. Undergoing unit aircraft conversion, as directed by MAJCOM.
              5.8.3.2.3.4. Removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or retirement).
              5.8.3.2.3.5. Participation in real world operations (to include operations other
              than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required flight evaluation(s)
              before or during deployment.
       5.8.3.3. Non-Standard Approval Authority
           5.8.3.3.1. For SQ/CCs and above (e.g. OG/CCs, WG/CCs, etc.), the approval
           authority is the next commander in the examinee’s flying chain of command.
           5.8.3.3.2. In all other cases, if the flying chain of command differs from
           administrative chain of command (e.g. HHQ attached flyers), approvals will be by the
           attached unit/CC with the concurrence of the examinee’s immediate administrative
           supervisor.
           5.8.3.3.3. For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval
           authority.
   5.8.4. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
   member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
   eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.2) or within the
   period for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.3), the aircrew
   member loses the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph
   5.6.3 apply.
       5.8.4.1. Qualification may be re-established by accomplishing a complete requalification
       evaluation (to include requisites) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation.
       5.8.4.2. OG/CCs may waive the re-accomplishment of completed requisites on a case-
       by-case basis (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
5.9. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (squadron or above) may direct a
downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific area/sub-area without unqualifying an individual. Additionally, a
commander may direct a downgrade that either removes a qualification (e.g. IP to MP) or
completely unqualifies an individual (e.g. MP to UP). Downgrades may be directed without
administering an evaluation using the following guidance:
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                        35


   5.9.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only (e.g., breach of flying discipline, flight
   safety, etc.). Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner, but may be
   recommended by an examiner from any MDS/aircrew specialty.
   5.9.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
   administrative or judicial actions (e.g. Letter of Counseling, Article 15, etc.). (Consult with
   the supporting SJA office for legal advice in these cases.) Use in cases where such incidences
   directly affect the commander’s confidence in the aircrew member’s ability to safely operate
   the aircraft and/or equipment (e.g. lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the
   aircrew’s decision-making abilities in the aircraft).
   5.9.3. For downgrades that either remove qualifications or completely unqualify an
   individual, the affected aircrew will cease acting in the qualification(s) from which they have
   been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade.
   5.9.4. Commander Directed Downgrades will be documented IAW paragraph 7.4.
5.10. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members who
maintain qualification in two or more MDS aircraft. For Universal Qualification see paragraph
5.11.
   5.10.1. When differences between aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead
   MAJCOM, in coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate
   qualification requirements.
   5.10.2. When separate qualifications are not required, document certification in different
   MDS series using AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. In lieu of the AF Form
   4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized
   official.
   5.10.3. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
   including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   See AFI 11-202, Vol 1.
   5.10.4. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
   include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified by
   the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are directed by
   the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
   5.10.5. QUAL and MSN Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL evaluation, and, if
   applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each MDS aircraft they maintain
   qualification according to applicable AFI MDS Vol 2, or AFI 16-1202 Vol 2.
   5.10.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q3 on an INSTM evaluation results in a
   downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A downgrade
   resulting from a Q3 in a QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft for which the
   evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is
   applicable to additional aircraft.
5.11. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized aircrew
who maintain qualification in two or more MDS where qualification is attained/maintained via a
minimum of a ground phase examination. A flight phase evaluation, when required, may be
 36                                       AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011


accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either gaining or maintaining
qualification.
   5.11.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualifications IAW
   Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified crewmember
   eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
   5.11.2. Documentation. See Chapter 7 or Chapter 8, as applicable.
   5.11.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications maintained
   under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A MSN
   evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 and/or MAJCOM supplement
   to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will include a flight phase evaluation in
   one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member maintains qualification.
   5.11.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally qualified
   aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in loss of
   applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI MDS Vol 2.
5.12. Aircrew Flying in Non-USAF Aircraft and with Non-USAF Units. Aircrew members
authorized to perform duties in non-USAF aircraft IAW AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached
to non-USAF units for flying, abide by host service or host country guidance, except for the
requirement to maintain a current physical and review their flight records according to AFI 11-
202, Vol 1 and AFI 11-401.
   5.12.1. Aircrew flying with non-USAF units (i.e. Exchange) do not need to abide by USAF
   guidance, including this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF
   units, they must complete applicable requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF
   evaluations that expired during their tour. The restrictions in paragraph 5.6.3 of this
   instruction apply to such individuals until successful evaluations are completed.
   5.12.2. MAJCOM/A3s may approve exceptions to requirements for returning Exchange
   aircrew members to complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if they
   determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2
   evaluations (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
   5.12.3. USAF units that use non-USAF aircraft to execute a USAF flying program will
   comply with current USAF guidance, unless when excepted by proper authority. See AFI 11-
   401 for definitions of USAF and US Government aircraft.
5.13. Initial Cadre.
   5.13.1. Aircrew members who are appointed by their MAJCOMs as initial cadre either for a
   new mission set requiring a MSN qualification or for a new MDS where no flight examiner
   currently exists will comply with the intent of this instruction.
   5.13.2. See paragraph 7.5 for guidance on Form 8/8a documentation.
   5.13.3. MAJCOMs will indicate through MFR which aircrew are appointed as initial cadre
   and include in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   5.13.4. Tailor recurring evaluations to program requirements and aircraft capabilities.
   Simulators may be used to satisfy recurring evaluation requirements.
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                   37


  5.13.5. Pilots in these programs will maintain an instrument qualification (see paragraph
  5.2.2). Maintenance of the instrument qualification, if not practical due to the developing
  capabilities of the new mission set and/or MDS, will be accomplished in aircraft possessing
  similar flying qualities/instrumentation as stipulated in the MAJCOM supplement/AFI 11-
  MDS Vol 2/MOU.

                         AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written or computer-
based examinations.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) pilots,
navigators, combat systems operators, and air battle managers), CEA, non-rated X-prefix AE
aircrew and RPA sensor operators. For Flight Surgeons (rated), Combat Camera, and non-rated
aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code) that only require an examination to
establish qualification, see Chapter 8. The examination program in this chapter includes
requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and unit periodic examinations. Requisite
examinations include qualification open book and closed book examinations, instrument
examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in paragraph 5.5.1.1.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will document the unit-level aircrew examination
   program.
   6.3.1. (914AW) The 914 OG requisite testing program consists of an open-book, closed-
   book and boldface examination during the qualification eligibility periods for all crew
   positions. For the mission eligibility periods, all crew positions will accomplish a boldface
   examination, mission open-book examination and tactical open-book examination. Pilots
   and navigators will complete an instrument examination during their instrument/qualification
   eligibility period. All crew position mission and qualification open-book examinations may
   be combined IAW AFI 11-2C-130V2. All test banks (except Tactics) are maintained in
   PEX. A Secure Question Bank (SQB) will be built and maintained by the OGV crew
   representative for open book tests. Closed book (MQF) and IRC QDB’s are built by sources
   other than OGV and are maintained in PEX by the OGV crew representative. Tactics open-
   book exam is a written exam maintained by the 914 Tactics office. This test is administered
   in Tactics due to the need for a secure testing environment. Tactics Exam grade sheets are
   forwarded to OGV and manually entered into PEX. Tests will be graded using the PEX
   program and results can then be automatically logged on the AF Form 8. Detailed program
   administration procedures are located in 914 OG Process Guide J.
       6.3.1.1. (Added-914AW) Requisite examinations should be completed in the first four
       months of the member’s eligibility period.
       6.3.1.2. (Added-914AW) Flight Surgeon Testing: Refer to Roadmap to
       Access/Navigate Online Flight Surgeon Aircrew Qualification Test located under (Tab 3)
       of Operational Process Guide J. Flight surgeons will be administered a standardized open
       book examination located on the AFIADL website (https://afiadl.mont.disa.mil) using a
       17 month cycle. Questions will be randomly generated from a test bank maintained by
       AFMSA/SGPA. The examination will be corrected to 100% by OGV and tracked via AF
       Form 8 and in AFORMS.
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                      39


   6.3.2. Computer-Based Examinations. MAJCOM directed Stan/Eval software may fulfill
   the requirement for exams as outlined in this instruction.
   6.3.2. (914AW) The 914 OG/OGV utilizes PEX to execute the Aircrew Examination
   Program.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. Retain graded exam answer sheets/computer
   records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
6.4. Exam Sources.
   6.4.1. Open Book Exams. Open book questions will come from publications containing
   information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and performance of the assigned
   mission.
      6.4.1.1. The open book subject areas and the publications used to generate the exam will
      be made available to aircrew during testing. Electronic publications may be used as
      references for open book examinations.
      6.4.1.2. Each unit will develop an open book Secure Question Bank (SQB) that serves as
      the source for the open book exam. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
      safeguard it in the same manner as any other required Stan/Eval exam.
      6.4.1.2. (914AW) Open book exam sources are listed in Attachment 8 of this
      supplement.
   6.4.2. Closed Book Exams. Questions will come from MQFs.
      6.4.2.1. MDS/crew position-specific MQFs. Lead MAJCOMs will ensure MDS/crew-
      specific MQFs are available for using MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable
      aircrew.
          6.4.2.1.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
          administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
          procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
          6.4.2.1.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate MAJCOM.
          Lead MAJCOMs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes to MQFs as
          necessary.
      6.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local procedures
      MQF to augment MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   6.4.3. Instrument Exams. Reference AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program.
   Units will ensure that only those questions relevant to the weapons system(s) and instrument
   procedures within their unit are included in the available questions from which aircrew will
   test.
   6.4.4. Exam Question Review. The MAJCOM, NAF, and OG Stan/Eval functions will
   review all MDS/crew position-specific MQFs, SQBs, and prepared exams (if used) annually
   and after any changes in source documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a
   source document change it may be annotated as the annual review. Units will document
   procedures for the exam reviews in their supplement to this instruction.

   6.4.4. (914AW) QDB’s must be updated any time a publication change affects questions in
   the respective bank. Questions should also be updated minimally annually. Once the review
   is complete update the review date in PEX on the QDB details page. To update a question
   bank, refer to the PEX User’s Guide. Requisite Exams will be updated annually normally in
   January. If source documents change a review of affected exams will be accomplished. The
   month and year will be included in the requisite exam name as documentation of the
   review/update.
       6.4.4.1. (Added-914AW) If a question is found to be incorrect, inaccurate, or non-
       applicable it should be marked as ―Bad Question‖ on the ―edit question‖ tab of the PEX
       Testing Module. Record all actions taken in the Test Discrepancy Report (Tab 2). Any
       questions in the Open Book, IRC, or Instructor banks may be changed without
       coordination with NAF. However, any changes made to the Closed Book banks must
       have prior NAF approval. The ―Bad Question‖ tab in the PEX system is for OGV
       reference to questions needing to be changed. It does not preclude that question being
       assigned on subsequent tests. If you want to throw a question out, so it cannot be
       assigned again, you need to select the ―Question N/A‖ tab.
6.5. End-of-Course Exams. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses listed in the Air
Force      Education     and    Training    Course     Announcement        (ETCA)    database
(https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) exams to fulfill the requirements
of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite exams.
   6.5.1. The Stan/Eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate with
   the MDS lead MAJCOM to ensure the EOC exam meets the requirements of this instruction
   and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 before awarding credit for requisite completion.
   6.5.2. EOC exam questions do not need to incorporate MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures and
   not conflict with any MQFs.
   6.5.3. All EOC exams that fulfill the requirements of requisite exams will be graded
   according to paragraph 6.8 and entered on the AF Form 8/8a according to paragraph 7.3.5.1.
6.6. Exam Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs exams, units will either
maintain prepared exams for each crew position or generate a unique exam for each aircrew
member.
   6.6.1. If prepared exams are maintained for each crew position:
       6.6.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two exams for each
       crew position.
       6.6.1.1. (914AW) A minimum of two new randomly generated requisite exams specific
       to each crew position will be developed annually normally in January. These exams will
       be stored electronically in PEX under the testing module. A hard copy will be printed
       and stored in the testing drawer.
       6.6.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one exam.
       6.6.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information, units are
       not required to maintain separate exams for each crew position.
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                        41


       6.6.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on each prepared exam each
       calendar year.
   6.6.2. If a unique exam is generated for each aircrew member:
       6.6.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for exam creation.
       6.6.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain at least twice the number of questions
       required for each exam (e.g. if a 50-question exam is generated, there must be at least 100
       questions in the exam database).
   6.6.3. When published guidance changes, the associated prepared exam or exam database
   (depending on method used) will be updated as soon as possible upon receipt.
6.7. Exam Security. Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all requisite exams,
applicable answer sheets, and associated computer-based media.
6.8. Grading.
   6.8.1. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs exams on the two-tier grading system (i.e.
   Q/U). Satisfactory performance requires writing the proper actions in the correct sequence,
   not necessarily a verbatim response. The minimum passing grade is 100 percent.
   6.8.2. Written or Computer-Based Examinations. Grade written or computer based
   examinations as a percentage of correct answers. The minimum passing grade is 85 percent.
   All questions missed will be reviewed immediately following the exam.
   6.8.3. Units will grade all requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew
   member’s next flight.
6.9. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam.
6.9. (914AW)Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam. For any failed requisite exam/Boldface the
exam proctor will notify OGV and fill out Notice of Flight Status action checklist.
   6.9.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination must be
   afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other than Boldface/CAPs, the
   aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
   6.9.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite exam must complete a
   successful reexam by the end of the third month following the date of the first failure, or the
   end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first. Waiver authority to extend the time
   allowed to successfully complete the reexam is the OG/CC (document IAW paragraph
   7.8.3.2.2).
   6.9.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
   Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful Boldface/CAPs
   reexam is accomplished.
   6.9.4. Supervised Status.
       6.9.4.1. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite open/closed book or instrument
       exam in supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7 until successful retesting is completed.
       6.9.4.2. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status
       resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the
 42                                      AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011


      aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of the instrument exam
      results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all aircraft in which
      instrument qualification is required.
6.10. Unit Periodic Examinations (Optional). If used, MAJCOMs and/or units will include
guidance in their supplements to include procedures for failed exams.
   6.10.1. Each group/squadron Stan/Eval function may conduct periodic testing for all aircrew.
   The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite
   exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or
   operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit.
   6.10.1. (914AW) 914 OG/OGV will not normally accomplish Unit Periodic Examinations.
   The OG or SQ/CCs may, from time to time, task 914 OG/OGV to administer Unit Periodic
   Examinations.
   6.10.2. Administration of the exam is at the discretion of the MAJCOM and/or unit.
   6.10.3. Periodic exams will not count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy
   the requirement for a periodic exam.

                                            Chapter 7

                                      DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications for which an aircrew member is to be evaluated are
determined from the unit certification document. This chapter provides documentation guidance
for members that require an in-flight evaluation to establish qualification. See Chapter 8 for
documentation guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-rated aircrew that
only require an examination to establish qualification.
   7.1.1. The results of aircrew evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8/8a. The
   chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF Form 942,
   Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF.
   7.1.2. In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use
   of electronic signatures and wholly electronic FEFs IAW MAJCOM supplement guidance. In
   all instances, computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published on the USAF E-
   Publishing web site.
7.2. Qualifications versus Certifications. Qualifications are attained through evaluations and
documented on the AF Form 8/8a, as applicable. Certifications are attained through methods
other than evaluation (e.g. commander certifications, flight lead upgrades, etc.) and may be
documented on an AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications or on a unit certification
document signed by an authorized official.
7.3. AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. The AF Form 8/8a is the source document used to record and verify the
   qualification of an aircrew member.
       7.3.1.1. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification in a single aircraft.
       7.3.1.2. Use of the AF Form 8a is optional for aircrew maintaining qualification in
       multiple aircraft and/or multiple series qualification in the same MDS or are Universal
       Qualified.
       7.3.1.3. Completion of an AF Form 8/8a is accomplished by four individuals: the flight
       examiner, a Reviewing Officer, a Final Approving Officer, and the examinee.
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8, Attachment 4 for
   sample AF Forms 8a.
       7.3.2.1. In all instances of data entry, if an electronic form is used, the format required by
       the electronic form will be used (see also paragraph 7.1.2).
       7.3.2.2. For date fields use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit year format
       (e.g. 24 Jun 12).
       7.3.2.3. The ―Eligibility Period‖ and ―Expiration Date of Qualification‖ blocks will use a
       three-letter month and two-digit year format (Jun 12).
       7.3.2.4. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation,
       ―INSTR‖), use upper and lower case letters.

     7.3.2.5. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
     data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
     desired.
  7.3.3. Date Completed.
     7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date of the evaluation requisites (ground or flight
     phase) or the additional training if assigned.

         was given. When no flight phase evaluation was accomplished or when aircrew are
         qualified in two or more aircraft IAW Universal Qualification guidelines, enter the
         primary aircraft MDS.
         7.3.4.3.3. Enter the examinee’s highest qualification reflecting the intention of the
         evaluation in that particular MDS. Note: Examiner (e.g. EP, EF, etc.) is not a
         qualification, it is a certification, and should only be entered when the flight examiner
         is receiving a SPOT Flight Examiner Objectivity evaluation IAW MAJCOM
         supplements.
     7.3.4.4. Eligibility Period.
         7.3.4.4.1. Enter the 6-month period preceding the expiration date from the last
         similar periodic aircrew qualification evaluation (e.g., if the last MSN evaluation

46                                      AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011


        qualification guidance in paragraph 5.10 and universal qualification guidance in
        paragraph 5.11.
        7.3.5.2.2. Mission/Check.
            7.3.5.2.2.1. IAW paragraph 5.2, use the following designations to describe the
            purpose of the evaluation(s): INSTM, QUAL, MSN, INSTR, or SPOT. If
            combined, include the designation of each evaluation (e.g., QUAL/MSN,
            INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.).
            7.3.5.2.2.2. Use the following prefixes, when applicable, to describe the type of
            evaluation: INIT, RQ, N/N and/or SIM. More than one prefix may be used to
            describe an evaluation as outlined in paragraph 5.2.6.
                7.3.5.2.2.2.1. The only annotations of INSTR used are INIT INSTR and RQ
                INSTR as described in paragraph 5.2.4.
                7.3.5.2.2.2.2. INSTR will not be used for periodic evaluations as the AF Form
                8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with the instructor designation
                (e.g. IB, IN, IP)
                7.3.5.2.2.2.3. When requalification deals with regaining a complete loss of
                instructor qualification, document it as RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
            7.3.5.2.2.3. Make a single line entry to document the flight(s)/event(s) used to
            complete the evaluation.
            7.3.5.2.2.4. Make multiple single line entries for each flight/event if two or more
            flights/events are required and administered by either different flight examiners or
            on separate days.
            7.3.5.2.2.5. Where a single mission (such as airlift tasking) consists of multiple
            flights over one or more days with the same flight examiners, a single line entry
            may be used.
        7.3.5.2.3. Date.
            7.3.5.2.3.1. Enter the date the flight/event was completed.
            7.3.5.2.3.2. For evaluations where a single mission consists of multiple flights
            over one or more days (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2.5), enter the inclusive dates of the
            flight(s). Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
            7.3.5.2.3.3. For evaluations conducted on missions consisting of a single flight
            spanning more than one day, use a single line entry with the date the mission was
            completed. Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
     7.3.5.3. Qualification Level.
        7.3.5.3.1. Annotate the examinee’s overall qualification level IAW the definitions of
        paragraph 5.3.3 by placing a ―1‖ (for Q1) or ―2‖ (for Q2) in the qualified block or a
        ―3‖ (for Q3) in the unqualified block.
        7.3.5.3.2. Combined evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL, INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.)
        require only one grade if all evaluations were awarded the same overall level.
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       47


            7.3.5.3.2.1. If the overall level varies for each type of evaluation accomplished,
            indicate the qualification level for each part separately (e.g., ―INSTM: 1‖ and
            ―QUAL: 2‖ in the qualified block or ―INSTM/MSN: 1‖ in the qualified block and
            ―QUAL: 3‖ in the unqualified block).
        7.3.5.3.3. (Form 8a) Place a 1, 2, or 3 in the Qual Level block next to the applicable
        flight phase.
        7.3.5.3.4. (Form 8a) This section does not apply to Universal Qualified aircrew
        members or to crewmembers that do not require a flight phase evaluation (see
        Chapter 8).
     7.3.5.4. Expiration Date of Qualification.
        7.3.5.4.1. IAW paragraph 5.8.1. for evaluations that establish a new eligibility

        phase of the evaluation was successfully completed.
        7.3.5.4.2. For evaluations that do not establish a new eligibility period, enter ―N/A.‖
        7.3.5.4.3. Combined evaluations require only one date if all parts of the evaluation
        were successfully completed and/or ―N/A‖ if all parts were assigned an unqualified
        grade.

7.6. AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications (Optional). See Attachment 7 for sample
AF Forms 4348.
   7.6.1. Purpose. The AF Form 4348 provides a record of aircrew certification that may be
   kept in the FEF.
      7.6.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 4348 in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1
      documenting certifications by assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew
      members with aircraft certifications in multiple MDS aircraft which do not require
      qualification in each aircraft (e.g. F-16C and F-16CM), only one AF Form 4348 is
      required; specify the primary mission MDS designation.
      7.6.1.2. Unit Stan/Eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
      aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
      certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
      7.6.1.3. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review previous AF Form 4348
      entries to determine all applicable certifications of new assigned/attached aircrew
      member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications accepted by the gaining flying
      unit commander on a new AF Form 4348.
      7.6.1.4. The OGV/squadron Stan/Eval Chief or other individual designated by the
      SQ/CC will sign a one line entry below all other entries verifying that above certification
      transcriptions are accurate.
      7.6.1.5. Do not use AF Form 4348 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
      directed by MAJCOM.

     7.6.1.6. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form 4348
     entry include MAJCOM and/or supplement; AFI11-2MDS Vol 1; AFI11-2MDS Vol 3.
  7.6.2. General Data Entry.
     7.6.2.1. Complete individual identification block with last name, first name, middle
     initial, any titles (e.g., Jr. or II), last four of SSN, unit MDS and unit (assigned/attached
     for flying) organization/location.
     7.6.2.2. Use one line for each certification.
     7.6.2.3. Enter each certification in chronological order based on the date the action is
     completed.
     7.6.2.4. For date fields in the AF Form 4348, use a two-digit day, three-letter month and
     two-digit year format, or as required for electronic forms.
  7.6.3. Certification.
     7.6.3.1. Certified Event Title. Enter each certification title on the top block on the AF
     Form 4348.
     7.6.3.2. Enter the instructor’s rank, name and organization who completed applicable
     training for the certified event below the event title of the Certified Event block for the
     MDS under which the certification is given.
     7.6.3.3. Date Certified. Enter the effective date of certification.
     7.6.3.4. For certifications attained as part of a FTU, the date will match the date of the
     applicable AF Form 8/8a, or enter the date of completion or graduation from FTU if no
     AF Form 8/8a is issued.
     7.6.3.5. Certification Official/Organization. MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF
     Form 4348 certifying officials. The Certifying Official will sign above their typed name,
     rank, organization and office symbol.
     7.6.3.6. The Certifying Official is the person authorized by governing directives to
     approve or certify an aircrew member for a specific position or event.
     7.6.3.7. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on the AF Form
     4348 in the Remarks block.
  7.6.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
  Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
     7.6.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
         7.6.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
         but also applies to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
         substandard performance).
         7.6.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, place an ―X‖ in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7 for example.
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                      57


     7.6.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
     performance.
         7.6.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
         occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI11-2 Vol 1, when instructor certified events
         become core mission events, or when a higher certification is obtained making the
         previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also applicable for
         decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than substandard
         performance.
         7.6.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification, place an ―X‖ in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7. Note: For decertification
         due to loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the effective date of
         decertification will be the date of certification loss.
         7.6.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
         Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: annotate ―Renamed (new
         title)‖ under Remarks.
         7.6.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
         Stan/Eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new MDS and
         transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.3.
  7.6.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional
  information for an AF Form 4348 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
  AF Form 4348.
  7.6.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 4348. Units may use a computer-generated AF
  Form 4348 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
  maintained. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
  e-Publishing web site.
     7.6.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 4348 must be signed IAW guidance in this
     section. The signature on a computer-generated AF Form 4348 certifies:
         7.6.6.1.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
         certifying official.
         7.6.6.1.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
         proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-
         generated AF Form 4348.
  7.6.7. Unit Supplement. Describe unit AF Form 4348 procedures/program. Include a list of
  certifications applicable to the unit with appropriate source documents and designated
  certifying officials. Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 4348
  are also included in ARMS. Annotate if someone other than the Chief of OGV/squadron
  Stan/Eval has been authorized by the SQ/CC to sign the last line of an AF Form 4348 to
  signify transcription accuracy.

     FEF, documentation will be IAW paragraph 8.1.
     7.8.1.2. The FEF must be maintained by a Stan/Eval functional office - normally in the
     organization to which the individual is assigned or attached for flying.
     7.8.1.3. HHQ personnel on active flying status may have their FEFs maintained by the
     Stan/Eval function of the unit to which they are attached for flying.
     7.8.1.4. For personnel on inactive flying status, the FEF will be maintained with their
     Flight Records Folder (FRF).
     7.8.1.5. Individuals assigned or attached to other than USAF units may use the format of
     the service to which they are attached to document their history of qualifications.
  7.8.2. Electronic FEFs.
     7.8.2.1. For electronic FEFs, any hard copy historical information (once incorporated
     into the electronic FEF system) will be archived with the Stan/Eval function that
     maintains the FEFs. Archive method will be at unit discretion.
     7.8.2.2. Scanned versions of historical documents will be saved IAW AFI 33-364,
     Records Disposition—Procedures and Responsibilities.
     7.8.2.3. Electronic FEF systems must be able to produce hard copies of FEF products,
     when needed, consistent with the guidance in this AFI. Additionally, the electronic FEF
     must be transportable.

        more crew positions in the same MDS will file AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order
        – without consideration of MDS or crew position.
        7.8.3.2.2. MFRs.
            7.8.3.2.2.1. MFRs documenting waivers, extensions, and/or unusual
            circumstances to potentially be included in an AF Form 8/8a are filed on top of
            the affected AF Form 8/8a.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.1. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the
                applicable AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional
                Comments, when action is complete.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.2. Once MFR information is incorporated onto the AF Form 8/8a,
                remove the MFR from the FEF.
            7.8.3.2.2.2. Expiration Date Extensions (see also paragraph 5.8.3.2).

  7.8.5. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
  and how to implement the periodic review of FEFs.
     7.8.5.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
     aircrew members to verify their qualification(s) (and certifications on AF Form 4348 if
     used) prior to their first flight.
        7.8.5.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the qualification
        of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable documentation in
        Sections I and II of the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.2. Following the initial review, the unit maintaining the FEF is responsible
        only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                      61


        7.8.5.1.3. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
        Stan/Eval function at the unit/squadron to which they are attached to fly, the
        Stan/Eval function of that unit/squadron will also review the FEF prior to their first
        flight.
     7.8.5.2. Posting Review.
        7.8.5.2.1. The Stan/Eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a and AF Forms
        4348 (if used) when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and completeness.
        7.8.5.2.2. The Form 8/8a review will confirm that the eligibility period and
        qualification as documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events and
        requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that all signatures and
        initials are obtained within the allotted time (see paragraph 7.3.8.5).
        7.8.5.2.3. The AF Form 4348 (if used) will be reviewed for correct certification
        signature and to ensure all previous entries are accurate and accounted for.
        7.8.5.2.4. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM supplement.
     7.8.5.3. Periodic Review.
        7.8.5.3.1. The Stan/Eval function will review all applicable FEFs to confirm
        expiration dates used to track required aircrew qualification evaluations are the same
        as those listed in the FEFs. Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is
        not required.
        7.8.5.3.2. The interval between reviews will not exceed the standard qualification
        period window unless a more restrictive review period is established by the
        MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.3. Document the periodic review IAW MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
  7.8.6. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8/8a, AF
  Forms 4348 (if used), AF Form 942, and any MAJCOM-directed documentation.
     7.8.6.1. Major Discrepancies. Discrepancies that affect the qualification of the affected
     aircrew member.
        7.8.6.1.1. Major discrepancies are documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section
        I or II immediately above the affected AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348 (if used), or in
        chronological order for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348
        (if used).
        7.8.6.1.2. MFRs documenting similar major discrepancies found on multiple AF
        Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
     7.8.6.2. Minor Discrepancies. Discrepancies that do not affect the qualification (and/or
     certifications if using the AF Form 4348) of the affected aircrew member (e.g. typos,
     formatting and misspellings).
        7.8.6.2.1. Minor discrepancies are documented on a non-permanent record as defined
        by the MAJCOM or unit supplement to this instruction and need not reside in the
        FEF.

     7.8.6.3. Corrections.
         7.8.6.3.1. AF Form 8/8a. As a source document, the AF Form 8/8a may be
         corrected by use of white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document
         provided the flight examiner signing Section III of the form initials the correction. If
         the original FE is not available then document the discrepancy IAW paragraphs
         7.8.6.1 or 7.8.6.2. When the original FE is not available, OGV Chiefs may also
         correct minor discrepancies as prescribed in MAJCOM supplements.
         7.8.6.3.2. AF Form 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be altered
         without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected aircrew member and the
         contents of the FEF.
         7.8.6.3.3. AF Form 4348 (if used). AF Forms 4348 may be corrected by use of
         white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document provided the certifying
         official signing that line of the AF Form 4348 initials the correction. For significant
         corrections that alter the certification’s intent, make a new AF Form 4348 entry.
         7.8.6.3.4. Electronic Corrections. If the system used to store the record does not
         allow corrections to be made, then document the discrepancy IAW paragraph 7.8.6.1
         and/or paragraph 7.8.6.2.
  7.8.7. Transfer of FEF.
     7.8.7.1. Retention of Records. Retain all records in the FEF until reviewed by the
     gaining unit. After review, return to the individual those forms not retained in the FEF.
     7.8.7.2. Formal Training Graduates. For Formal Training School graduates reporting
     directly to an overseas command for a short tour, retain formal training school records for
     transfer to the subsequent gaining unit.
     7.8.7.3. PCS of Individual. Aircrew members will normally hand-carry their FEF along
     with their FRF to the gaining organization.
         7.8.7.3.1. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail the
         folder to the gaining unit via registered mail.
         7.8.7.3.2. Mail any records not included in the FEF to the gaining organization with
         clear identification of the individual concerned.
         7.8.7.3.3. When mailing an FEF or any of its contents, retain a copy (hard or soft
         copy is acceptable) until the gaining organization has received the original FEF.
  7.8.8. Disposition of FEF.
     7.8.8.1. Dispose of the aircrew FEF according to the Air Force Records Disposition
     Schedule (RDS) and Air Force guidance concerning the protection of Personally
     Identifiable Information.
     7.8.8.2. Outdated certification documents, ARMS products, medical recommendations

                                          Chapter 8

                                SPECIALIZED AIRCREW

8.1. Purpose. This chapter provides additional guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, Combat
Camera, and non-rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification.
   8.1.1. Initial and periodic qualification consists of a written (open or closed book)
   examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion of the examination,
   members will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal qualification).
   8.1.2. MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and/or MDS-Specific
   qualification requirements.
   8.1.3. Qualification requirements will be documented on an AF Form 1522, ARMS
   Additional Training Accomplishment Report, and stored in ARMS in the Formal Training
   module with currency tracked in the Training module. No AF Form 8/8a or FEF is required;
   however, the Stan/Eval function of the unit to which specialized aircrew are
   assigned/attached for flying will verify that ARMS information is logged appropriately.
   When MAJCOMs or subordinate units require a flight phase, or if directed by the applicable
   MDS-Specific Volume 2, document IAW Chapter 7 (to include creating an FEF).
8.2. Evaluations. Initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required) examinations are considered
QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this AFI, but may be prescribed in
MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
   8.2.1. Flight Surgeons. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by AFMOA/SG3P.
   8.2.2. Combat Camera. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by the Combat Camera career field manager (CFM), in coordination with HQ
   USAF/A3O-AT and using commands.
   8.2.3. Non-Rated Aircrew Members. Test questions will come from the lead MAJCOM
   Master Question Files (MQFs).

       ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS (FCIF, SII, GO/NO-GO, SUPPLEMENTARY
                          EVALUATIONS)

9.1. FCIF.
   9.1.1. Units will establish and maintain a library consisting of a current read file and
   publications. This library will consist of a minimum of four volumes as listed in Table 9.1 in
   either hardcopy or electronic format.
   9.1.2. FCIFs may be issued to alert crewmembers to publications changes for TOs or AFIs
   that affect aircraft operations, but actual publication changes must be accomplished IAW
   established procedural guidance, to include AFI 33-360 (as applicable) and TO 00-5-1.
   9.1.3. Required Volumes. Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current read
   file items, Volumes II through IV are made up of publications and flight manuals, and
   Volume V (optional) is reserved for flight safety information. If units choose hardcopy
   format and the contents of any volume exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional
   binder and identify the first and subsequent binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB).
   Label binders on the spine indicating Volume and Title as follows:

Table 9.1. Required Volumes.

VOLUME                        TITLE

      through V.
      9.1.4.2. Part B is the Current Read File of FCIF messages. Messages contain information
      temporary in nature, directly pertinent to the safe conduct of flight, and must be read
      before flight. FCIFs that contain aircraft-related information will be forwarded to all
      using MAJCOMs.
      9.1.4.3. Part C is the Current Read File that contains information temporary in nature but
      not related to the safe conduct of flight and not required to be read before flight.
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       65


      9.1.4.4. Squadrons with both primary crewmembers and mission crewmembers may use
      separate sections in Volume I for mission crewmembers. In addition, these squadrons are
      exempt from the requirement to maintain mission crewmember checklist and aircrew aids
      in the FCIF volumes.
      9.1.4.5. Refer to Attachment 7 for a sample FCIF format.
   9.1.5. Publications Library. Volumes II through IV will consist of an FCIF Functional
   Publications Library according to MAJCOM directives. See AFI 33-360 for basic library
   requirements.
      9.1.5.1. All publications in the library will be current and complete. MAJCOMs may
      authorize units to withhold posting of information that does not apply based on aircraft
      configuration.
      9.1.5.2. Units will establish and maintain a table of contents for the publications library
      containing, as a minimum, a listing of basic publications numbers and short titles.
      Publication dates, supplements and changes are not required.

      (i.e., Red Flag).
      9.1.5.4. The FCIF index and library will be filed IAW AFI 33-360, regardless of
      hardcopy or electronic format.
         9.1.5.4.1. If any part of the FCIF library is maintained electronically and not
         specifically addressed above (or in AFI 33-360 and/or TO 00-5-1), units will ensure
         that the information is current and accessible for concurrent viewing by multiple
         aircrew members.
         9.1.5.4.2. At a minimum, units will maintain the required index and location of
         electronic files in a hard-copy binder in the FCIF library.
 66                                        AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011


           9.1.5.4.3. Documents in the FCIF library will be made available for deployments via
           either electronic or hardcopy means.
9.2. Flight Related SII.
   9.2.1. Flight Related SIIs are items of emphasis relating to existing procedure(s) designed to
   mitigate or eliminate specific risks or trends.
       9.2.1.1. SIIs do not add to or amend established procedures (reference guidance on
       issuing FCIFs in paragraph 9.1, above).
       9.2.1.2. SIIs will be based on analysis of risks and trends from a variety of sources to
       include Safety Investigation Board (SIB) findings/recommendations, safety related
       incidences, trend analysis, deployed area of operations and potential problems with
       equipment/procedures.
   9.2.2. SII(s) will be issued through the same process used to release FCIFs with the
   following elements:
       9.2.2.1. Specific MDS applicability
       9.2.2.2. References (document, SIB, etc)
       9.2.2.3. Risk factors and trend details
       9.2.2.4. Specific emphasis actions to reduce/eliminate the risk or trend that generated the
       SII.
       9.2.2.5. Effective date of rescission
       9.2.2.6. SME/POC for further information
   9.2.3. SII(s) will be of limited duration (generally not to exceed 90 days).
   9.2.4. SII(s) may be issued/rescinded from the HAF, MAJCOM, NAF or unit level. If issued
   from agencies outside the MAJCOMs (e.g. HAF, HQ AFFSA, but not subordinate NAFs or
   units), the lead MAJCOM stan/eval function will coordinate the intent and verbiage of the
   SII with other MAJCOM stan/eval functions in order to determine the level of applicability
   within the individual MAJCOMs prior to release.
   9.2.5. Units will place all applicable SIIs into the FCIF, Current Read File, Part B, for
   dissemination to crewmembers.
   9.2.6. All current MDS-Specific and CRM/ORM related SII(s) will be briefed during flight
   briefings for the duration of the SII(s). Mission-specific SII(s) need only be briefed on those
   missions for which the SII is relevant.
9.3. Go/No-Go Procedures. Units will establish a positive control system that ensures aircrew
members have completed all ground training and Stan/Eval items required for flight. Units will
provide guidance on this system in the unit supplement.
9.3. (914AW)Go/No-Go Procedures. The aircrew GO/NO-GO Go program ensures safe and
efficient flight operations through a systematic and redundant review of individual qualifications
and currencies prior to conducting flying operations. The primary method of determining Go/No-
Go is through Patriot Excalibur (PEX) see Fig. 1. If PEX is unavailable the Ops
Sup/Aeromedical Evacuation Operations Officer (AEOO) will use the current Aircrew Restricted
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                         67


Status Letter (RSL) and/or current Squadron Aviation Resource Management (SARM)
Individual Training Summary (ITS) and a current listing of crewmember(s) on DNIF status.
Also it ensures a thorough post mission review to validate the prior days training priorities. This
entire process is outlined in 914 OGV Process Guide I.
   9.3.1. As a minimum, the Go/No Go system will monitor:
   9.3.1. (914AW) It is the responsibility of each aircrew member in conjunction with the unit
   leadership, SARM/HARM, OGV, aircraft commander, Ops Sup/Aeromedical Evacuation
   Operations Officer (AEOO), training, and each section supervisor to ensure they are, in all
   respects current and qualified to fly. Newly assigned aircrew will complete an In-processing
   Checklist in coordination with their section supervisor/training to ensure they are cleared
   administratively prior to flight.
       9.3.1.1. Form 8/8a qualification or appropriate ARMS products.
       9.3.1.2. Ground and flight currency items required for flight IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
       AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, and AFI 11-421 Aviation Resource Management.
       9.3.1.3. Examination items required for flight from this AFI and applicable supplements
       (see Chapter 6).
       9.3.1.4. Any Duty Not Involving Flying (DNIF) status.
       9.3.1.4. (914AW) Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) will update PEX for
       DNIF status.
       9.3.1.5. Currency on all FCIF (Volume 1, Part B) items.
           9.3.1.5.1. (Added-914AW) Prior to flight all crewmembers will, through PEX,
           verify that all Part B FCIF’s are updated and signed off.
           9.3.1.5.2. (Added-914AW) After FCIF’s have been verified, crewmembers will
           then initial the original flight authorization order at the Ops Sup/AEOO desk. By
           initialing the flight order the crewmember is indicating that they are properly crew
           rested and have adequate Flight Duty Period (FDP) remaining to complete the flight,
           they are ready to fly, and are not DNIF or otherwise medically disqualified.
           9.3.1.5.3. (Added-914AW) If PEX is not available or a crewmember(s) cannot
           access their PEX account, they will then read any unfamiliar Part B FCIF(s) at the
           Operations Supervisor duty station. When all unfamiliar Part B FCIF’s have been
           reviewed, the crewmember(s) will then initial the original flight order and include the
           number of the last FCIF read.
           9.3.1.5.4. (Added-914AW) All FCIF’s will be available for crewmember review in
           paper copy at the Operations Supervisor duty station.
       9.3.1.6. (Added-914AW) Prior to daily flying operations, the Ops Sup/AEOO will use
       available products (PEX/GRSL/AFORMS ATR/Letter of X’s/) to verify the status of
       each crew member. SARMS/AEOO personnel will also be responsible to check
       grounding items prior to printing the AF Form 4327a, Flight Authorization (Flight
       Orders).
 68                                      AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011


          9.3.1.6.1. (Added-914AW) Prior to each flight, the Ops Sup/AEOO in conjunction
          with the aircraft commander, will ensure all Go/No Go checks are complete. The
          following items will be checked:
              9.3.1.6.1.1. (Added-914AW) All crewmembers have reviewed and signed off all
              Part B FCIF’s in PEX. If PEX is down crewmembers will review the hard copy
              FCIF Part B located at the Ops Sup counter.
              9.3.1.6.1.2. (Added-914AW) All aircrew members have initialed the original
              copy of the Flight Authorization.
              9.3.1.6.1.3. (Added-914AW) Monthly Bold Face Test is correct and current for
              each crewmember(s).
              9.3.1.6.1.4. (Added-914AW) All aircrew members are checked for flight/ground
              currency/restriction(s) using PEX and/or the Grounded/Restricted Status Letter
              (GRSL) and/or Aircrew Training Report (ATR) listing DNIF crewmember(s).
              9.3.1.6.1.5. (Added-914AW) 328 AS crews will use for all flights the AMC
              Operational Risk Management (ORM) Matrix. The 914 AES will use the 914
              AES ORM sheet.
      9.3.1.7. (Added-914AW) A post mission review will normally occur at 0900 the
      following day after every mission. This review will normally be conducted in the OGV
      conference area. This review will consist of a SARM, SQ/CC or DO, representative
      applicable crew positions, training representative, AE as applicable and MX if available.
      This review will verify 781 entries, training accomplished (MARs) and update Go-No-Go
      documentation as applicable. This Post Mission Review will use the Mission Review
      binder located in the OGV conference area) to guide the review process and ensure all
      materials are accurately reviewed.
          9.3.1.7.1. (Added-914AW) Once training events have been verified, as required an
          AF Form 4324 will be initiated and Letter of X’s updated to reflect new qualifications
          or certifications. Training will verify the accuracy of the GRSL and update as
          necessary.
9.4. Supplementary Evaluations.
   9.4.1. Purpose. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by a commander
   to ensure standardization of operations and to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to
   operational problems, such as negative checkride trends. The form and content of a
   supplementary evaluation is at the discretion of the commander directing it.
   9.4.1. (914AW) 914 OG Supplementary Evaluation Program is an administrative tool used
   to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to operation problems. The overall goal of
   the 914 OG Supplementary Evaluation Program is to enhance performance through a
   recommended improvement process. The evaluation data will be used as a tool in the
   improvement of tasks and functions of the training being evaluated. This program seeks to
   provide ―improvement comments‖ rather than ―critique comments‖. These evaluations can
   be used to evaluate trends. Supplementary Evaluations will be conducted at the
   direction/request of the 914 OG/CC.
   9.4.2. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
AFI11-202V2_914AWSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2011                                                     69


   9.4.3. The commander directing the supplementary evaluation will determine the areas to be
   evaluated. The Stan/Eval function directly under the commander directing the supplementary
   evaluation will determine the method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative
   management of data collection, and will report results as directed by the commander.
   9.4.3. (914AW) Possible Supplementary Evaluations may include but are not limited to
   Flight Records management, Aircrew Flight Equipment, Intelligence support, Mission
   Planning, Base Operations Support, Training Processes and Classes, Form 847 processes, etc.
   Virtually any operations related process or product in the 914 OG can be reviewed at the
   request of a commander. 914 OG/OGV will frame the issue, research AFIs and other
   regulations as required, and then schedule the evaluation as applicable.
   9.4.4. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the commander directing the
   supplementary evaluation, may participate in its conduct.
   9.4.4. (914AW) When a supplementary evaluation is directed, 914 OG/OGV will determine
   the scope of the evaluation and who will accomplish the evaluation.
   9.4.5. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight
   evaluation. If conducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations will not be all-encompassing,
   result in the assignment of an overall grade or be documented on an AF Form 8/8a.
   9.4.6. At a minimum, supplementary evaluations results will be documented in SEB minutes
   (see Attachment 2).
   9.4.6. (914AW) All Supplementary Evaluations will be discussed and documented in the
   SEB minutes.
9.5. Forms Adopted. AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record, AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication, AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for
Flying or Special Operational Duty, AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment
Report, AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
