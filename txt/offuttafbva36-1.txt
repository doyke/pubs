   THE AIR FORCE HAS A PROCEDURE FOR RESOLVING COMPLAINTS OF DISCRIMINATION. ANY CIVILIAN
   EMPLOYEE OR APPLICANT FOR EMPLOYMENT WHO BELIEVES HE OR SHE HAS BEEN DISCRIMINATED
   AGAINST BECAUSE OF RACE, COLOR, RELIGION, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, HANDICAP, OR AGE IN ANY
   EMPLOYMENT MATTER SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF THE AIR FORCE, MAY FILE A COMPLAINT OF
   DISCRIMINATION. HOWEVER, BEFORE A FORMAL COMPLAINT CAN BE FILED, A COMPLAINTANT MUST FIRST
   CONSULT WITH AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY (EEO) COUNSELOR WITHIN 45 DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE
   ALLEDGED DISCRIMINATORY ACT OR THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF A PERSONNEL ACTION. EMPLOYEES
   REPRESENTED BY AFGE LOCAL 1486 AND IAFF LOCAL F-191 HAVE THE OPTION OF FILING UNDER THE
   NEGOTIATED GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES OR AIR FORCE PROCEDURES, BUT NOT BOTH.

   DURING THE INITIAL PRECOMPLIANT (INFORMAL) STAGE, A COMPLAINANT WILL BE REQUIRED TO ELECT
   HOW INFORMAL RESOLUTION WILL BE ATTEMPTED. INFORMAL RESOLUTION MAY BE ATTEMPTED EITHER
   THROUGH ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) OR THROUGH TRADITIONAL EEO COUNSELING
   PROCESSES, IN WHICH, AN EEO COUNSELOR WILL CONDUCT AN INQUIRY INTO THE ALLEGATION(S) AND
   ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE MATTERS INFORMALLY. DURING THIS PROCESS, A COMPLAINANT MAY CHOOSE TO
   REMAIN ANONYMOUS. ADDITIONALLY, A COMPLAINANT MAY HAVE REPRESENTATION OF HIS OR HER
   CHOICE AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS. IF THE MATTER HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM
   THE DATE THE MATTER WAS BROUGHT TO A COUNSELERâ€™S ATTENTION, THE COMPLAINANT WILL BE
   NOTIFIED IN WRITING OF A RIGHT TO FILE A FORMAL COMPLAINT OF DISCRIMINATION.

   THE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT PROCESS IS COVERED UNDER AFI 36-1201. THIS INSTRUCTION OUTLINES
   PROCEDURES AND TIME FRAMES FOR FILING COMPLAINTS. ADDITIONAL EEO INFORMATION AND
   REFERENCES CAN BE FOUND AT THE EEO WEBPAGE: https://wwwmil.offutt.af.mil/55wg/eeo
