1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection or assessment.
As a minimum, units should use USAFE inspection checklists in conjunction with the Unit Self-Assess-
ment. The objective is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities. Higher
headquarters may use this checklist in whole or in part during visits. Users may add items that, in the exer-
cise of good judgment, require examination.
    1.1. Core Compliance Guide Items (CCGI) and Compliance Guide Items (CGI). Items identi-
    fied by functional managers to prioritize command requirements and to allow the Inspector General
    (HQ USAFE/IG) inspectors to assess criticality of deficiencies.
       1.1.1. CCGI. Items identified by HQ USAFE directorates and functional managers as key result
       areas for successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to, items where non-com-
       pliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, litigation or affect system reliabil-
       ity. These requirements may be mandated by law, Executive Order, DoD directive, safety or Air
       Force and USAFE strategic plans. CCGIs will be referred to as significant guide items requiring
       direct IG evaluation. Upper case and bold letters are used to identify CCGIs.
       1.1.2. CGI. Areas that require special vigilance and are important to the overall performance of
       the unit. Non-compliance could result in some negative impact on mission performance but is not
       likely to result in injury, unnecessary cost, or litigation. Standard sentence case is used to identify
       CGIs.

2. Applicability. All items on this inspection checklist are assigned an applicability code designating to
which type of unit the item applies. Applicability code 3 designates the following USAFE main operating
bases (MOB): Aviano, Incirlik, Lakenheath, Mildenhall, Ramstein, Lajes and Spangdahlem. Applicability
code 7 designates all USAFE Geographically Separated Units (GSU) with Logistics Readiness functions
(Supply, Transportation, Logistics Readiness Planning and Policy).
