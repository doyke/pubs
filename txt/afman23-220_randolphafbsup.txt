because they were redundant; these references repeated language already in AFMAN 23-220.
The following paragraph numbers were changed to more accurately match AFMAN 23-220
references; paragraphs: 21.3.4. changed to 14.1.23.; 21.3.4.1. changed to 14.1.23.1.; 21.3.4.2.

commander explaining the delay must accompany the ROS. ROS will not be processed and

7.1. The unit commander/director (or equivalent) to whom the lost, damaged, or destroyed
property was issued will appoint a “disinterested” investigating officer by letter (see Attachment

18.4.3.1.1. (Added-Randolph AFB) Regardless of the dollar value, the vehicle control office
completes Standard Form 91, Motor Vehicle Accident Report, which includes photos of the
vehicle damage. The vehicle control office electronically forwards the accident investigation
report with photos, and all other pertinent documents to the ROS Program Manager. The vehicle
control office also notifies the unit commander of the organization that has possession of the
vehicle that a preliminary ROS investigation is required.

18.4.3.1.2. (Added-Randolph AFB) Once notified, the commander immediately appoints an
investigating officer, one who is immediately available to conduct a preliminary investigation on

the ROS Manager.

investigation report with photos to the investigating officer, and as soon as possible thereafter,
the ROS Program Manager briefs the investigating officer on her/his duties and responsibilities.

18.4.3.1.4. (Added-Randolph AFB) After reviewing the accident investigation report and
photos, the investigating officer makes a recommendation as to whether or not a ROS should be
initiated, using the format provided by the ROS Manager. Additional time may be needed if the
investigating officer believes it necessary to interview anyone associated with the accident and/or
to obtain a copy of the police report (if available). When complete, the investigating officer
forwards a recommendation to the ROS Program Manager.

18.4.3.1.5. (Added-Randolph AFB) The ROS Program Manager prepares a preliminary report

preliminary report to determine whether or not a ROS will be initiated. The Appointing

and to all other concerned parties.
