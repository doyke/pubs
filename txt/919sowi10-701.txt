SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include more detail for new electronic/technology notification procedures of SERENE
BYTE/PACER WARE messages. Several attachments were deleted/and or revised due to the
 2                                                                919SOWI10-701 15 MAY 2012


new messaging format changes. All references to 8 SOS personnel were removed due to unit
mission changes.
1. General. This instruction establishes the 919 SOW’s policy for reprogramming our
electronic warfare equipment when tasked to do so by higher headquarters (HHQ). It assigns
responsibilities and defines procedures for reprogramming Electronic Warfare (EW) systems,
which can be used under routine and emergency conditions. The overall objective is to provide
the 919 SOW with an expeditious and accurate flow of information and coordinate operations
and maintenance actions in compliance with Major Command (MAJCOM) directed
reprogramming. These reprogramming procedures will be used for both exercise (SERENE
BYTE) and actual (PACER WARE) system changes, unless HHQ guidance dictates otherwise.
     1.1. This instruction is not a single source document and must be used in conjunction with
     AFI 10-703, and other applicable MAJCOM directives. All personnel should read and be
     familiar with the concepts and procedures of these directives. If a perceived conflict exists
     between this instruction and other applicable directives, the most restrictive guidance applies.
     1.2. All unit commanders and functional area supervisors are responsible for complying with
     the directives contained in this instruction.
     1.3. Submit recommended changes to the 919 Operational Support Squadron Weapons and
     Tactics (919 OSS/OSK) Electronic Warfare Point of Contact (EW POC), through the
     functional area supervisors using either an AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
     Publication or a plain text memorandum.
2. Policy. The 919th Special Operations Wing Commander (919 SOW/CC) or his designated
representative, may waive the directives established by this instruction in the interest of safety or
mission accomplishment.
     2.1. Functional areas, affected by this instruction, should maintain a copy of this instruction.
     Personnel should be familiar and comply with the concepts and procedures in AFI 10-703,
     and AFSOCSUP1.
     2.2. Each of the following organizations involved in the EWIR process plays a vital role in
     the successful and expeditious reprogramming of our EW equipment. Coordinated
     interaction between all organizations is essential and any new methods of improving the
     communication and implementation of reprogramming procedures should be directed to 919
     OSS/OSK.
     2.3. The central point of contact for all 919 SOW reprogramming activities is the designated
     919 SOW EW POC.
     2.4. The 919 SOW primary EW POC will reside in 919 OSS/OSK and be an Air Reserve
     Technician (ART) Pilot, Navigator, or Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO). All 711 Special
     Operations Squadron (SOS) ART EWOs, not serving as the primary EW POC, will serve as
     an alternate EW POC. Unless specified otherwise, the term EW POC will be considered the
     primary EW POC in this Operating Instruction (OI). In the event the 919 OSS/OSK EW
     POC position is vacant, an alternate EW POC will act as the primary functional
     representative for all EW POC issues. The EW POC will also function as the POC for
     Operational Change Requests (OCR) for resident EW systems.
919SOWI10-701 15 MAY 2012                                                                     3


   2.5. The 919 Operations Group Commander (919/OG/CC) and/or Deputy Commander (919
   OG/OGD), in coordination with 919 MXG/CC and 919 OG/CC, are authorized to assign the
   919 SOW’s primary and alternate EW POCs and all EWIR team members hereafter referred
   to as “Action Team” from operations, maintenance, intelligence, and communications
   personnel as necessary. EW POC and Action Team members will normally be selected from
   919 OSS/Weapons and Tactics (OSK), 919 OSS/Intelligence (IN), 919 Maintenance
   Squadron/Electronic Warfare System (919 MXS/MXMVE), 711 SOS/EWO Supervisor
   (DOLH), and 711 SOS/Current Operations (DOO). This appointment list, as a minimum,
   should be updated annually no later than (NLT) the end of the 1st quarter of each calendar
   year, or as necessary due to normal changes in personnel.
3. Responsibilities of the designated EW POC:
   3.1. Act as overall OPR for Electronic Combat (EC) issues. The EW POC is responsible for
   aircraft capabilities shortfalls, modifications, upgrades or developments impacting our
   aircraft EC posture. The EW POC will resolve EC issues as directed by wing leadership.
   3.2. Establish and maintain on file a current copy of the EW POC and EWIR Action Team
   appointment letter approved by 919 OG/CC (see Attachment 2) for 919 SOW personnel.
   The EW POC will submit the 919 OG/CC, or designated representative, a list of suitable
   POC and Action Team personnel for review, and make recommendations for changes when
   necessary.
   3.3. Maintain and act as EW POC for the Data Message System (DMS) functional account
   (classified and unclassified as required), in coordination with 53 Computer Support Squadron
   (53 CSS) and Electronic Combat Support Flight (ECSF), for SB/PW message access for the
   919 SOW. Develop an organizational Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET)
   mailbox (711 SOS/PW) in coordination with 919 CS Client System Technicians (919
   CS/SCOS), 919 CS Systems Administrators (919 CS/SCOO) and the Eglin Help Desk, for
   normal processing of incoming and outgoing SB/PW messages for the 711 SOS-PW (sc)
   EWIR database on file with ECSF. The EW POC will ensure all EW POCs (primary and
   alternate) and Action Team members have 711 SOS/PW SIRPNET organizational mailbox
   access. Note: All EW POC and Action Team members will have an Eglin Local Area
   Network (LAN) SIPRNET account in order to access the classified 711 SOS/PW mailbox
   due to system requirements. Upon request from individual senior personnel, the EW POC
   will coordinate mailbox access for 919 MXG/CC, 919 OG/CC, 919 OG/Deputy Commander
   (OGD), 919 MXS/CC, 919 OSS/CC, 711 SOS/CC, 711 SOS/Director of Operations (DO)
   and 919 SOW/Command Post (CP) staff.
      3.3.1. The EW POC, in coordination with 919 CS/SCOS and 919 CS/SCOO, will
      establish an unclassified email distribution list (711 SOS PW) on the Eglin LAN and
      ensure that EW POC and Action Team member’s Duke Field email addresses are entered
      and maintained in the distribution list. The EW POC will also include in this list the 919
      SOW/CP organizational mailbox and the following 919 SOW senior personnel Duke
      Field email addresses: 919 MXG/CC, 919 OG/CC, 919 OG/OGD, 919 MXS/CC, 919
      OSS/CC, 711 SOS/CC and 711 SOS/DO. This will allow automated receipt for all email
      addresses entered into the list to receive unclassified notification of SB/PW message
      traffic received in the 711 SOS/PW SIPRNET mailbox. In addition, the EW POC, will
      ensure, in accordance with (IAW) established procedures, all required electronic files for
 4                                                                  919SOWI10-701 15 MAY 2012


        logging, tracking etc., (see attachments) listed in this document are uploaded and
        accessible on the SIPRNET LAN.
