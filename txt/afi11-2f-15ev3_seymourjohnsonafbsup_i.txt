                                    MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning is shared jointly by all flight
members as well as the ops and intel functions in the unit.
2.2. General Procedures.
   2.2.1. Planning. Accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission execution to
   include fuel requirements, map preparation, and takeoff and landing data (TOLD) (USAFE:
   For sorties landing at other than home-station, reference AFI 11-202V3_USAFESUP_I,
   Attachment 4, CONTROL OF FIGHTER/ATTACK AIRCRAFT FOR OFF STATION
   SORTIES/DIVERT). Consider foreseeable safety risks and adopt risk mitigation factors in
   accordance with Operational Risk Management (ORM).
   2.2.2. Standards. The SQ/CC is the approval authority for squadron standards. OG/CC
   may publish and approve group or wing standards. Ops Group Stan/Eval (OGV) will review
   all standards for compliance with AFI 11-series guidance.
2.3. Unit Developed Checklists and Local Aircrew Aids.
   2.3.1. Unit developed checklists may be used in lieu of flight manual checklists (except -25
   checklists) provided they contain, as a minimum, all items (verbatim and in order) listed in
   the applicable checklist.
   2.3.2. Units will produce an aircrew aid that, as a minimum, includes:
       2.3.2.1. Briefing guides (reference Briefing Guide Attachments in this volume).
       2.3.2.2. Local radio channelization and airfield diagrams.
       2.3.2.3. Impoundment procedures, emergency action checklists, and No Radio
       (NORDO)/divert information.
       2.3.2.4. Arresting gear information for divert bases.
       2.3.2.5. Bailout and jettison areas and On-Scene Commander (OSC) checklist.
       2.3.2.6. Cross-country procedures to include: command and control, engine
       documentation, Joint Oil Analysis Program (JOAP) samples, and aircraft servicing.
       2.3.2.7. Other information as deemed necessary by the units (i.e. stereo flight plans, local
       training area diagrams, local area maps of sufficient detail to provide situational
       awareness on area boundaries).
2.4. Flight Material Preparation.
   2.4.1. Mission Data Card. TOLD will be annotated on mission data cards.
       2.4.1.1. The minimum TOLD required is maximum abort speed for expected conditions
       (i.e. dry/wet/icy), rotation/Nose Wheel Lift Off (NWLO)/takeoff speed, takeoff distance,
       single engine rotation/NWLO/SETOS, and normal/heavy weight landing distance.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                           11


     2.4.1.2. The most current version of Technical Orders (TO) 1F-15E-1-1, Flight Manual
     Performance Data USAF Series F-15E Aircraft and 1F-15E-1CL-1 Flight Crew
     Checklist USAF Series F-15E Aircraft are the authorized sources for calculating TOLD.
     2.4.1.3. Pre-calculated or automated (e.g. JMPS) data may only be used for TOLD if
     verified against the information in these TOs.
         2.4.1.3.1. Unit developed tabular data must be verified against the TOs and will
         include a date and signature block of the aircrew verifying it as correct.
         2.4.1.3.2. OPR for certification of TOLD in automated systems is ACC/A8SM. OPR
         for revocation of certification due to TO change is ACC/A3TV. Units will be
         informed of revocation via MAJCOM Flight Crew Information File (FCIF) message.
  2.4.2. Local Area Maps. A separate local area map is not required if the unit aircrew aid
  provides a local area map IAW para 2.3.2.7 (USAFE: on flights from a deployed location,
  each aircrew will have available a local map annotated with designated flying areas,
  emergency airfields, buffer zones, control zones, and restricted or danger areas if this
  information is not available in a deploy-location aircrew aid).
  2.4.3. Charts. Flight Information Publications (FLIP) en route charts may be used instead
  of maps on navigational flights within areas that are adequately covered by these charts.
  2.4.4. Low Altitude Maps.
     2.4.4.1. On all low altitude flights, each aircraft in the flight will contain a minimum of
     one Chart Handbook Manual (CHUM) updated map of the low altitude route or training
     areas. The map will be of a scale and quality that terrain features, hazards, and chart
     annotations are of sufficient detail to allow navigation and safe mission accomplishment.
     2.4.4.2. Annotate time or distance tick marks and headings. Highlight all manmade
     obstacles at or above the planned flight altitude.
     2.4.4.3. Annotate all maps with a Route Abort Altitude (RAA). Compute the RAA for
     the entire route/area at a minimum of 1,000 feet (2000’ in mountainous terrain) above the
     highest obstacle/terrain (rounded up to the next 100 feet) within the lateral limits of the
     route or training area, but in no case less than 5NM either side of planned route.
         2.4.4.3.1. Mountainous terrain is designated by FAR 95.11.
         2.4.4.3.2. When operating outside US domestic airspace any terrain above 3,000 ft.
         MSL will be considered mountainous terrain.
     2.4.4.4. Terrain Following (TF) Flight Map Preparation. In addition to the low
     altitude map requirements listed above:
         2.4.4.4.1. Annotate a Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) for each leg of the intended
         route of flight. MSA is defined as an altitude that provides 1000 feet of clearance
         above the highest obstacle/terrain (rounded up to the next 100 feet) within 5NM of
         the planned course.
         2.4.4.4.2. Annotate maximum and minimum route structure altitudes if applicable.
         2.4.4.4.3. To ensure maps accurately display planned routes, TF turn point bank
         angles must reflect realistic systems limitations.
 12                     AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


           2.4.4.4.4. In order to verify proper operation of the TF system, TF letdown corridors
           for the primary (and alternate, if applicable) entry points for low level routes will be
           computed and briefed. As a minimum, compute MSA and Recovery Initiation
           Altitude (RIA) as well as values for terrain at 1 NM and command level off.
           2.4.4.4.5. For night TF missions select letdown points that avoid initial descents into
           rugged or mountainous terrain (defined by TO 1F-15E-1 as any vertical change that
           exceeds 900 ft/NM).
   2.4.5. (CONUS Only) Aircrew members flying under VFR or inside MTRs will
   supplement existing mission planning materials (e.g. CHUM, FLIP AP/1B, etc.) with at least
   one of the following:
       2.4.5.1. JMPS (or FalconView if JMPS is not available) chart with the following overlay
       options selected: airports/heliports, airspace boundaries with approach control
       frequencies annotated, airways, MTR, parachute jump, and Special Use Airsapce (SUA)
       boundaries.
       2.4.5.2. Sectional Aeronautical Charts (SAC) (use in flight is not required) and
       1:250,000 low level charts/route books annotated with location and dimensions of class
       A/B/C/D airspace, civil/military airfields and other potential high density traffic areas
       (e.g., parachute activity areas and ultra light/hang-glider/glider sites, etc.) within 5 NM of
       any planned VFR route or MTR.
           2.4.5.2.1. Applicable airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity of class A,
           B, C, and D airspace will be annotated and briefed on all such flights.
           2.4.5.2.2. In addition, annotate and brief the intersection of other Visual Routes (VR)
           or Instrument Routes (IR) (if applicable) and any other possible areas of conflict.
   2.4.6. Aircrew members flying outside CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM, theater, or
   host nation guidance on mission planning (USAFE: reference AFI 11-
   202V3_USAFESUP_I, para. 2.1). If no gaining MAJCOM, theater, or host nation guidance
   exists, use the best charts or MPS overlay options available to accomplish the above
   requirements.
2.5. Fuel Conservation. Design procedures for optimal fuel use and efficiency throughout all
phases of mission execution. Incorporate enroute tasks to maximize use of airborne training
opportunities.
2.6. Preflight Brief.
   2.6.1. All flight crewmembers and passengers must attend the flight brief unless previously
   coordinated with unit supervisors.
   2.6.2. Anyone not attending the flight brief must receive, as a minimum, a brief on mission
   events and emergency procedures (EP) prior to step.
   2.6.3. Flight leads/instructors are responsible for presenting a logical brief which will
   promote safe and effective mission accomplishment.
       2.6.3.1. Ensure brief start time provides adequate time to discuss required items and
       accounts for mission complexity. As a minimum, begin briefs at least 1.5 hours before
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                          13


     scheduled takeoff. Alert briefs will start in sufficient time to be completed prior to
     aircrew changeover.
     2.6.3.2. Structure the brief to accommodate the capabilities of each flight member.
     2.6.3.3. Ensure contracts, roles, and responsibilities of each flight member are
     established, briefed, and debriefed.
     2.6.3.4. Include mission priorities, significant rules (e.g. Rules of Engagement [ROE],
     Special Instructions [SPINS], Training Rules [TRs]), task management, weather,
     NOTAMs, and EPs.
     2.6.3.5. Ensure a formation deconfliction, blind, and get well plan for every phase of
     flight is briefed and every flight member understands the plan (use para 3.10 as a
     baseline). All flight members are responsible for executing this plan.
     2.6.3.6. Review TOLD and ensure every member of the flight understands it. Place
     particular emphasis on takeoff abort factors during abnormal situations such as short or
     wet runway, heavy gross weights, non-standard cable configurations, and abort sequence
     in formation flights.
     2.6.3.7. Include the following special subjects: radar and visual search responsibilities
     during departure/enroute/recovery, high density traffic areas, mid-air collision avoidance
     both from other military aircraft as well as civilian aircraft.
     2.6.3.8. Include flight responsibilities, proper formation position (to ensure adequate
     wingtip clearance), and aircraft-unique requirements for each phase of flight when
     dissimilar aircraft or aircraft configurations are flown in the same formation.
     2.6.3.9. For missions using Night Vision Goggles (NVG), emphasize proper tuning, use,
     and limitations.
     2.6.3.10. Low Altitude Mission Briefs.
        2.6.3.10.1. Emphasize low altitude flight maneuvering, obstacle and ground
        avoidance, Low Altitude Warning System (LAWS) features and limitations, low
        altitude comfort level, and complacency avoidance.
        2.6.3.10.2. For low altitude training over water and featureless terrain, include
        specific considerations with emphasis on minimum altitudes and spatial
        disorientation.
        2.6.3.10.3. For low-level missions using TF, emphasize proper setup as well as both
        ground and air checks of the TF system, procedures for transitioning from medium
        altitude to low-level TF, and TF maneuvering limitations.
        2.6.3.10.4. For low-level missions using TF in conjunction with NVGs, emphasize
        the inherent limitations of both systems and the necessary maneuvering restrictions
        that each imposes.
     2.6.3.11. Alternate Mission Briefs. Brief an appropriate alternate mission for each
     flight.
        2.6.3.11.1. The alternate mission must be less complex than the primary and should
        parallel the primary mission (e.g. Basic Fighter Maneuvers as alternate for Air
 14                     AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


          Combat Maneuvers, Basic Surface Attack for Surface Attack Tactics, Tactical
          Intercepts for Defensive Counter Air).
          2.6.3.11.2. If the alternate mission does not parallel the planned mission, brief the
          specific mission elements that are different.
          2.6.3.11.3. Mission elements may be modified and briefed airborne as long as flight
          safety is not compromised. Flight leads will ensure changes are acknowledged by all
          flight members.
          2.6.3.11.4. Do not fly unbriefed (either on the ground or in the air) missions or
          events.
       2.6.3.12. Briefing Guides.
          2.6.3.12.1. Reference the attachments to this AFI for basic briefing guide examples.
          2.6.3.12.2. Subjects may be briefed in any sequence.
          2.6.3.12.3. Those items published in AFIs, Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and
          Procedures manuals (AFTTP) or unit standards and understood by all participants
          may be briefed as ―standard.‖
   2.6.4. Multiple Sortie Days.
       2.6.4.1. If all flight members attend an initial or mass flight brief, the flight lead on
       subsequent flights need brief only those items that have changed from the previous
       flight(s).
       2.6.4.2. On multiple-go days when aircraft turn times do not allow follow-on mission
       brief(s) and only the initial flight brief is accomplished for all gos, the following guidance
       applies:
          2.6.4.2.1. Upgrade missions will be flown on the first sortie (second sortie if the first
          is non-effective for weather, maintenance, or airspace availability).
          2.6.4.2.2. Subsequent missions will be of equal or less complexity with no additional
          upgrade training, unless approved by OG/CC.
          2.6.4.2.3. Participants in continuation training (CT) missions may fly their primary or
          alternate missions in any sequence.
2.7. Postflight Debrief.
   2.7.1. All missions will be debriefed.
   2.7.2. All flight debriefs will include, at a minimum, the in-flight execution of flight member
   responsibilities, deconfliction contracts, tactical employment priorities, and task
   management.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                               15


                                           Chapter 3

                          NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

Section 3A—Ground Operations

3.1. Preflight.
   3.1.1. Do not carry baggage or equipment in an unoccupied rear cockpit (EXCEPTION:
   Forms and maps may be stowed in the map case).
   3.1.2. The pilot will brief the ground crew as required. Prior to starting, the pilot will get an
   ―okay‖ signal from the rear cockpit occupant. Use operational headsets to the maximum
   extent possible during all engine start and pre-taxi checks as well as when technicians are
   performing tasks on the aircraft. Hand signals may be used as a last resort or if required
   during alert scramble or combat operations.
   3.1.3. In lieu of higher guidance (i.e. theater SPINS) flying units will specify a standard
   setting for the ejection seat radio beacon auto/manual selector switch.
   3.1.4. Select Pressure Breathing (PBG) on all sorties except those using Aircrew Eye and
   Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) or Aircrew Chemical Defense Equipment (ACDE).
   3.1.5. The use of the COMBAT EDGE vest is optional in the F-15E. If aircrew elect to fly
   with the COMBAT EDGE vest they will remove the port plug on the CRU-94 (if installed),
   properly stow the plug during flight to prevent a FOD hazard, then re-install upon completion
   of the sortie.
   3.1.6. During the Before Taxi flight control checks, confirm the proper movement and
   position of the flight control surfaces with the crew chief.
3.2. Ground Visual Signals. When ground intercom is not used, use visual signals IAW AFI
11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movements on the Ground and this volume. All signals
pertaining to operation of aircraft systems will originate with the pilot. The crew chief will
repeat the given signals when it is safe to operate the system. Aircrew should not activate any
system that could pose a danger to the ground crew prior to receiving proper acknowledgment
from ground personnel. The following signals augment AFI 11-218.
   3.2.1. Jet Fuel Starter (JFS) Start: With clenched fist, pilot makes a pulling motion.
   3.2.2. Flight Controls Check: Raise arm, clench fist, and make a stirring motion.
   3.2.3. Brake Check: Hold left or right arm horizontal, open hand and push forward,
   breaking at the wrist (as in applying rudder pedal pressure with feet).
   3.2.4. Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC), Improved Digital Electronic Engine
   Control (IDEEC)/Automatic Thrust Departure Prevention System (ATDPS)
   Check: With the fingers and thumb of each hand extended and joined at the tips, open and
   close the fingers and thumbs of both hands simultaneously, simulating nozzle opening and
   closing.
   3.2.5. Target Pod Clear: Extend arm and rotate a closed fist in a circular motion.
   3.2.6. Loss of Brakes While Taxiing: Lower tailhook.
 16                     AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


3.3. Taxi and Quick Check/Arming.
   3.3.1. The minimum taxi interval is 150 feet staggered or 300 feet in trail. Spacing may be
   reduced when holding short of or entering the runway.
   3.3.2. Do not taxi during snow or icy conditions until the taxi route and runway have been
   checked for safe conditions. In this case, taxi on the centerline with a minimum of 300 feet
   spacing. The minimum Runway Condition Reading (RCR) for taxi operations is 10.
   OG/CCs may waive this to RCR 8.
   3.3.3. Maximum taxi speed during sharp turns (more than 45 degrees of turn) is 10 knots.
   Above 10 knots the aircraft may skid or depart the three point attitude.
   3.3.4. At non-USAF bases aircrew will make every attempt to coordinate for a rollover/End
   of Runway (EOR) inspection with the host maintenance unit.
   3.3.5. Keep hands in view of ground personnel during quick check, arming, and de-arming
   operations. If the intercom system is not used during EOR checks, the pilot will establish and
   maintain visual contact with the ground personnel to allow the use of visual signals.
   3.3.6. Do not taxi in front of any aircraft arming or de-arming forward firing ordnance.
3.4. Flight Lineup. Flights will line up as appropriate based on weather, runway conditions,
and runway width.
   3.4.1. When separating elements use a minimum of 500 feet spacing between elements.
   3.4.2. For formation takeoffs wingmen must maintain wingtip clearance with their element
   lead.
   3.4.3. If runway width precludes line-up with wingtip clearance between all aircraft in the
   flight, use 500 feet spacing between elements or delay run-up until the preceding aircraft or
   element releases brakes.
3.5. Before Takeoff Checks. After arming and prior to takeoff all flight members will inspect
each other for proper configuration and any abnormalities.

Section 3B—Takeoff and Departure

3.6. Takeoff.
   3.6.1. Do not takeoff if the RCR is less than 12. OG/CCs may waive this to RCR 8.
   3.6.2. On training missions, do not takeoff if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80 percent of
   the available runway. For single-ship takeoffs, if the single-ship computed mil-power takeoff
   distance exceeds one-half of the available runway, takeoff using afterburner.
   3.6.3. When operating from airfields equipped with a compatible, remotely operated cable,
   ensure the departure end cable is raised for all takeoffs and landings, unless another departure
   end cable is in place.
   3.6.4. Use a minimum of 10 seconds (15 seconds when using afterburners) takeoff interval
   between aircraft or elements.
   3.6.5. Use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff interval when carrying live air-to-surface
   ordnance (N/A for 20mm ammunition) or when performing a radar trail departure.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                              17


   3.6.6. Pilots will steer toward the center of the runway at the start of the takeoff roll.
   3.6.7. OG/CCs may approve intersection takeoffs.
   3.6.8. Do not takeoff over any raised web barrier (e.g. MA-1A, 61QS11) or loose/slack cable
   (e.g. BAK-12/13/14).
   3.6.9. Suspected Hot Brake Speeds.
       3.6.9.1. Unit commanders will ensure Suspected Hot Brake speeds are re-calculated
       during Hot Pit or Quick Turn operations.
       3.6.9.2. A takeoff abort made when adequate brake cooling time is not met (usually
       within one hour of landing) can place the aircraft into the Brake Energy Caution Zone
       with brake applications as low as 80 kts (TO 1F-15E-1, Flight Manual--F-15E Section
       5). Use the following guidance:
          3.6.9.2.1. Absorbed energy from landings made one hour or less prior to subsequent
          takeoffs will be added in full.
          3.6.9.2.2. Use a maximum of 20 million foot-pounds to calculate the abort speed
          where suspected hot brakes will be declared.
3.7. Formation Takeoff.
   3.7.1. Formation takeoffs are restricted to elements of two aircraft.
   3.7.2. Elements must be led by a qualified flight lead unless an Instructor Pilot (IP) is in the
   element.
   3.7.3. Aircraft must be within 3,000 pounds of each other and symmetrically loaded.
   Consider symmetrically loaded as those store loadings that do not require an abnormal trim
   or control application to counter a roll or yaw during takeoff and acceleration to climb
   airspeed.
   3.7.4. Do not make formation takeoffs when:
       3.7.4.1. The runway width is less than 125 feet.
       3.7.4.2. The Runway Surface Condition (RSC) is reported as wet, or ice, slush, or snow
       is on the runway. OG/CCs may waive this requirement if the center 125 feet of the
       runway is clear of standing water, ice, slush or snow.
       3.7.4.3. The crosswind component exceeds 15 knots.
       3.7.4.4. Loaded with live air to ground munitions.
       3.7.4.5. Ferrying aircraft from a contractor or Air Logistics Center (ALC) facility.
   3.7.4.6. The computed takeoff roll exceeds 50% of the available runway.
3.8. Initial Join-up and Rejoins.
   3.8.1. Minimum day weather criteria for a VFR join-up underneath: ceiling 1,500 feet,
   visibility 3 miles (5 KM).
   3.8.2. Flight leads will maintain TO climb speeds until join-up is accomplished unless
   mission requirements necessitate a different airspeed.
 18                     AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


   3.8.3. Flight leads should limit their angle of bank to 30 degrees for turning rejoins
   immediately after takeoff.
   3.8.4. For further join-up procedures, see para 3.31 (Night) and para 4.2 (Instruments).

Section 3C—Enroute

3.9. Formation, General. Flight leads/instructors are responsible for ensuring contracts, roles
and responsibilities of each flight member are established and executed.
   3.9.1. If any flight member cannot fulfill their basic responsibilities, contracts, or other
   assigned tasks, they will immediately communicate that information to the flight or element
   lead.
   3.9.2. For additional formation considerations, reference AFTTP 3-3.F15E and AFTTP 3-
   1.F-15E, Tactical Employment—F-15E (Secret).
   3.9.3. IMC. In IMC the maximum flight size is four aircraft except when flying in close
   formation with a tanker (refer to TO 1-F15E-1, Section VIII Air Refueling Procedures and
   Allied Tactical Publication (ATP)-56(B), Air-to-Air Refueling).
   3.9.4. Maneuvers. Do not use rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain formation position
   below 5,000 feet Above Ground Level (AGL) or outside of SUA (USAFE: Consider SUA as
   anytime the aircraft is under Basic, Traffic, or Deconfliction Service).
   3.9.5. Signals. Airborne visual signals will be in accordance with AFI 11-205, Aircraft
   Cockpit and Formation Flight Signals. For four-ship flights, formation changes will be
   initiated by radio call when practical. When formation position changes are directed by radio
   all wingmen will acknowledge prior to initiating the change. A radio call is mandatory when
   directing position changes at night or in IMC.
   3.9.6. Recovery. When circumstances permit, flight leads will direct a battle damage (BD)
   check after each mission prior to or during Return to Base (RTB). This check is mandatory
   following the expenditure of any ordnance (including all types of 20mm ammunition) except
   at night or in IMC. Brief deconfliction responsibilities and position change procedures.
   3.9.7. Breakups. Flight leads will not break up formations until each wingman has a
   positive fix from which to navigate (i.e. visual, Inertial Navigation System [INS], Embedded
   GPS/INS [EGI], or Tactical Air Navigation [TACAN])
   3.9.8. Changing Leads. Lead changes require a clear transfer of responsibilities from one
   flight member to another.
       3.9.8.1. Lead changes will be initiated and acknowledged with either a radio call or
       visual signal.
       3.9.8.2. Ensure deconfliction is established before initiating a lead change.
       3.9.8.3. The lead change is effective upon acknowledgment.
       3.9.8.4. All flight members must continue to ensure aircraft separation during position
       changes.
       3.9.8.5. When flying in limited visibility conditions, initiate lead changes from a
       stabilized, wings level attitude.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                               19


      3.9.8.6. The minimum altitude for a lead change is 500 feet AGL over land or 1,000 feet
      AGL over water (for night see para 3.22.4.2., for IMC see para 4.6)
      3.9.8.7. When conducting lead changes from fingertip, route, spread, or tactical, do not
      initiate lead changes with the wingman further aft than 30 degrees from line abreast.
3.10. Formation Deconfliction.
   3.10.1. General. Apply the following rules for flight path deconfliction during tactical
   maneuvering:
      3.10.1.1. Flight leads will consider wingman/position and ability to safely perform a
      maneuver before directing it.
      3.10.1.2. Trailing aircraft and elements are responsible for deconfliction from the lead
      aircraft and elements. Wingmen and elements will deconflict vertically from the
      lead/lead element to the max extent practical. During low altitude maneuvering (1000’
      AGL and below), wingmen and trailing elements will deconflict above the lead/lead
      element.
   3.10.2. Loss of Visual. Use the following procedures when one or more flight members lose
   visual contact within the formation or between elements:
      3.10.2.1. When any flight member calls "blind", they will initially maneuver away from
      the last known position of the other flight member/element (primarily by altering altitude)
      and await a response. The appropriate flight member will immediately respond with
      "visual" and a position report or "blind".
      3.10.2.2. If the other flight member is also "blind", then the flight lead will take action to
      ensure altitude separation between flight members and elements.
          3.10.2.2.1. The flight lead will specify either AGL or Mean Sea Level (MSL) when
          directing the formation to deconflict and use a minimum of 500 feet altitude
          separation.
          3.10.2.2.2. Avoid climbs or descents through the deconfliction altitude when
          possible.
      3.10.2.3. If visual contact is still not regained, the flight lead will take additional action
      to ensure flight path deconfliction within the flight to include a Terminate/Knock-It-Off
      (KIO) call if necessary. The flight lead should consider scenario restrictions such as
      sanctuary altitudes and adversary blocks when directing deconfliction.
      3.10.2.4. Aircraft will maintain altitude separation until visual and, if necessary, will
      navigate with altitude separation until mutual support is regained.
   3.10.3. Two-Ship. The following rules apply for flight path deconfliction during tactical
   maneuvering of two-ship formations:
      3.10.3.1. The wingman is normally responsible for flight path deconfliction.
      3.10.3.2. The flight lead becomes responsible for deconfliction when:
 20                   AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


          3.10.3.2.1. Tactical maneuvering places the lead in the wingman's "blind cone" or
          forces the wingman's primary attention away from the lead (i.e. wingman becomes
          the engaged fighter).
          3.10.3.2.2. The wingman calls "padlocked" or ―blind‖.
      3.10.3.3. Deconfliction responsibility transfers back to the wingman once the wingman
      positively acknowledges a visual on his lead (except in cases of tactical maneuvering
      where the flight lead is no longer in the wingman’s ―blind cone‖).
   3.10.4. Three/Four-Ship (or Greater). When flights of more than two aircraft are in
   tactical formation:
      3.10.4.1. Formation visual signals performed by a flight or element lead pertain only to
      the associated element unless specified otherwise by the flight lead.
      3.10.4.2. Trailing aircraft and elements will maintain sufficient spacing so that primary
      emphasis during formation maneuvering and turns is on low altitude awareness and
      deconfliction within elements, not on deconfliction between elements.
3.11. Chase Formation.
   3.11.1. Restrictions. Any pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft with a problem or under
   emergency conditions.
      3.11.1.1. Pilots who have successfully completed an Instrument and Qualification
      evaluation may chase as safety observer for aircraft performing simulated instrument
      flight or hung ordnance patterns.
      3.11.1.2. Specialized missions (i.e., Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E), Weapon
      Systems Evaluation Program (WSEP), live weapons delivery, etc.) and training
      conducted IAW AFI 11-2F-15EV1 may be chased by Combat Mission Ready
      (CMR)/Basic Mission Capable (BMC) pilots designated by group or squadron
      commanders.
      3.11.1.3. All other chase events may only be flown by an IP, Flight Examiner (FE), or
      upgrading IP (UIP) under the supervision of an IP.
   3.11.2. Procedures.
      3.11.2.1. A safety observer in a chase aircraft, except IP/FE/specialized mission chase,
      will maneuver in a 30-60 degree cone and maintain nose/tail separation to effectively
      clear and provide assistance.
      3.11.2.2. IP/FE/specialized mission aircraft will maneuver as necessary, but must
      maintain nose/tail separation.
      3.11.2.3. No chase aircraft will stack lower than the lead aircraft when below 1,000 feet
      AGL.
      3.11.2.4. For live ordnance missions, the chase pilot is responsible for maintaining own
      ship frag deconfliction.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                              21


3.12. Show Formation. Refer to AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures and
applicable MAJCOM directives for specific rules and appropriate approval levels to participate
in static displays and aerial events.
3.13. Maneuvering Parameters.
   3.13.1. If flight through wingtip vortices or jetwash is unavoidable or inadvertently
   encountered, immediately unload the aircraft to approximately 1 G.
   3.13.2. Do not extend flaps during Air Combat Training (ACBT).
   3.13.3. Minimum Altitudes.
       3.13.3.1. Nose high, low speed recoveries and Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC)
       vertical maneuvers: 10,000 feet AGL.
       3.13.3.2. Aerobatics: 5,000 feet AGL.
   3.13.4. Authorized speeds. (CONUS) Below 10,000 MSL (outside SUA or MTRs) fly no
   faster than the maneuvering airspeeds as published in TO 1F-15E-1 (e.g. 300 KCAS unless in
   the radar pattern). In order to aid adherence to this guidance, flight leads and aircrew will
   comply with the following:
       3.13.4.1. (CONUS) Accomplish air-to-air (A/A) systems checks above 10,000 MSL to
       the maximum extent possible.
       3.13.4.2. (CONUS) Accomplish TF checks above 10,000 MSL to the maximum extent
       possible. If TF checks must be accomplished below 10,000 MSL (i.e. due to weather)
       aircrew will minimize the time at higher airspeeds.
       3.13.4.3. Aircrew flying outside the CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM, theater, or
       host nation guidance on airspeeds (USAFE: Aircrew will operate at airspeeds consistent
       with TO 1F-15E-1, AFTTP 3-3.F-15E, and local guidance). If no gaining MAJCOM,
       theater or host nation guidance exists, use the guidance in this instruction to the
       maximum extent practical.
3.14. G-Awareness Exercise.
   3.14.1. G-awareness exercises will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules
   and Procedures. The Heads Up Display (HUD) will be filmed during G-awareness exercises
   with hot mic in both cockpits.
   3.14.2. During maneuver execution use visual lookout and briefed formation contracts as
   primary means to ensure aircraft deconfliction. Use onboard systems (i.e. FDL) only as an
   aid to situational awareness.
   3.14.3. Do not use G-awareness turns for systems checks or other items that detract from the
   intended purpose.
   3.14.4. Flight leads will ensure the airspace intended for conducting the G-awareness
   exercise is free from potential traffic conflicts. Use Air Traffic Control (ATC) services to the
   maximum extent practical to aid in clearing the airspace. Conduct the G-awareness exercise
   in the following airspace with preference to the order as listed (USAFE: Consider SUA as
   anytime the aircraft is under Basic, Traffic, or Deconfliction Service):
 22                    AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


       3.14.4.1. SUA (e.g. Restricted or Warning areas, ATC Assigned Airspace, [ATCAA],
       Military Operating Areas [MOA], or MAJCOM-approved large-scale exercise and
       special mission areas).

   214. A KIO applies to any phase of flight and any type of mission.
   3.15.2. Wingman acknowledgment of flight lead radio calls indicates the wingman
   understands or that the appropriate action is complete or in the process of being completed.
   3.15.3. In addition to the radio procedures outlined in AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1
   and V2, Instrument Flight Procedures, and FLIP publications, the following radio
   transmissions are required:
       3.15.3.1. All flight members will acknowledge understanding the initial ATC clearance.
       Acknowledge subsequent ATC instructions as directed by the flight lead.
       3.15.3.2. Gear Checks. Each pilot will report gear down IAW the following guidance,
       but in no case later than crossing the runway threshold:
          3.15.3.2.1. Base turn for overhead patterns.
          3.15.3.2.2. Prior to 3NM final for VFR straight-in.

          approaches.
          3.15.3.2.4. A wingman or chase ship need not make this call during a formation or
          chased approach.
3.16. Air Refueling. Pilots undergoing initial or recurrency training in air refueling will not
refuel with a student boom operator (does not apply to KC-10). The receiver aircrew will ensure
no student-to-student AR occurs during initial or recurrency training.
3.17. Low Altitude Procedures.
   3.17.1. Formation. Line abreast formation is only authorized at or above 300 feet AGL.
   When flying below 300 feet AGL direct the wingman to a wedge formation position.
   3.17.2. Terrain and Obstacle Clearance.
       3.17.2.1. All obstacle avoidance planning will be based on MSA and RAA as defined in
       para 2.4.4.
       3.17.2.2. If unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral separation from known obstacles
       that could be a factor to the flight, flight leads will direct a climb not later than 3 NM
       prior to ensure sufficient vertical separation IAW with AFI 11-202V3 paragraph 5.10.
       Do not descend back into the low level environment until visual with the obstacle or
       positional awareness dictates it is safe to do so.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                           23

     briefed minimum altitude or 90 percent of the command-directed minimum altitude,
     whichever is higher.
     3.17.2.4. During all low altitude operations, the immediate reaction to task saturation,
     diverted attention, KIOs, or emergencies is to climb to 1000 feet AGL or higher (e.g.
     MSA or RAA if at night).
  3.17.3. Maneuvering. When crossing high or hilly terrain, maintain positive G and do not
  exceed 120 degrees of bank. Maneuvering at less than 1G is limited to upright bunting
  maneuvers only.
  3.17.4. Minimum Airspeed. The minimum airspeed for low level (less than 1000’AGL)
  navigation is 300 KCAS.
  3.17.5. Minimum Weather. The minimum WX for visual low level training is 1,500 feet
  ceiling and 3SM visibility (USAFE: 1500’/8KM) or as specified in FLIP for MTRs, unit
  regulations, or national rules, whichever is higher.

     Training Unit (FTU) students with instructors when conducting training IAW an
     applicable syllabus.
     3.17.6.3. 100 Feet AGL for LOWAT Category III qualified aircrews. Training in the
     100 feet to 300 feet AGL altitude block will be in short segments consistent with real-
     world risks and realistic tactical considerations.
     3.17.6.4. ―Show of Force‖ maneuvers will be flown at or above aircrew LOWAT
     minimum.
     3.17.6.5. For night operations the minimum altitude is MSA unless operating under the
     conditions of para 3.18 (TF Operations) and/or para 3.34 (Night Vision Goggles
     Procedures)
     3.17.6.6. For over water operation the minimum altitude is 1000 feet above the surface
     unless in sight of land or using TF flyup protection. If in sight of land or using TF flyup
     protection the minimum altitude may be lowered to 500 feet above the surface.
     3.17.6.7. For Air to Surface range operations, minimum altitudes will be determined by
     range, AFI 11-214, or aircrew delivery restrictions, whichever is greater.
  3.17.7. Low Altitude Route and Area Entry Procedures. Accomplish entry/descent into
  the low altitude structure or training area under an ATC radar service (e.g. flight following)
  to the maximum extent practical.

      required, or if the RAA or MSA is higher than the vertical limits of the route or area.
      3.17.9.4. Attempt contact with the appropriate ATC agency for an IFR clearance. If
      required to fly in IMC without an IFR clearance, cruise at appropriate VFR altitudes until
      IFR clearance is received.
   3.17.10. Low Altitude Target Pod Use. The target pod may be used down to aircrew

   3.18.1. The minimum altitude for TF training will be the higher of MTR, MOA, or aircrew
   LOWAT category.
   3.18.2. Unarmed TF operations are prohibited.
   3.18.3. The pilot will maintain 400 KCAS minimum airspeed in mountainous terrain as
   defined by TO 1F-15E-1 (any vertical change that exceeds 900 ft/NM).
   3.18.4. Minimum equipment required for TF operations is TF radar, radar altimeter (RALT),
   and E-SCOPE. For IMC TF a functioning A/A and A/G radar is also required.
   3.18.5. Check TF systems in flight using TO 1F-15E-1 procedures prior to TF operations. If
   any feature critical to overall system performance (e.g. RALT, INS) is questionable or
   disabled and cannot be fixed IAW 1F-15E-1CL-1 or 1F-15E-34-1-1-CL-1, discontinue the
   TF portion of the mission.
   3.18.6. Each crew will confirm by inter-cockpit communication that the TF and RALT are
   on and working properly before descending below the MSA.
   3.18.7. Initially set a 1000 feet AGL Set Clearance Plane (SCP) to verify proper systems
   operation prior to commencing letdown to a lower SCP.
   3.18.8. During low altitude operations, the pilot will not operate any heads down sensor
   while outside of TF system limits. Sole attention will be placed on re-establishing aircraft
   parameters within TF limits.
   3.18.9. Any intentional maneuvering that will put the aircraft outside of TF limits will be at
   or above the MSA (or RAA if not within 5NM of course) or within the restrictions of para
   3.34 NVG Procedures.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                                   25


   3.18.10. Abnormal Operation during IMC TF. Aircrews who experience failure of any
   portion of the TF system or A/A / A/G radar while flying IMC TF will immediately climb to
   (or above) the MSA (or RAA if not within 5NM of course).
       3.18.10.1. If the failure(s) can be cleared and safe TF regained, TF operations may
       resume.
       3.18.10.2. If the aircraft position cannot be accurately determined, aircrews will
       terminate the low level portion of the mission and execute route abort procedures IAW
       para 3.17.7.
3.19. Fuel Requirements.
   3.19.1. Joker Fuel. A pre-briefed fuel needed to terminate an event and proceed with the
   remainder of the mission.
   3.19.2. Bingo Fuel. A pre-briefed fuel that allows the aircraft to return to the base of
   intended landing or alternate (if required), using preplanned recovery parameters and arriving
   with normal recovery fuel as listed below.

       3.19.4.2. Emergency Fuel. 800 pounds or less.

Section 3D—Recovery and Landing

3.20. Overhead Traffic Patterns.
   3.20.1. Overhead patterns may be flown with unexpended A/G practice ordnance (to include
   inert heavyweight), live air-to-air missiles, and any 20mm ammunition. Overhead patterns
   may be performed at deployed locations with unexpended live ordnance if required by local
   force protection arrival procedures.
   3.20.2. Initiate the break in the first 3,000 feet of the runway or as local procedures direct.
   3.20.3. Execute individual breaks in a level 180 degree turn to the downwind leg at
   minimum intervals of 5 seconds (except IP/FE chase or when in tactical formation).
   3.20.4. Aircraft must be wings level on final at approximately 300 feet AGL and 1 mile from
   the planned touchdown point.
3.21. Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns. Tactical entry to the overhead traffic pattern is
permitted when:
   3.21.1. Specific local procedures are developed and coordination has been accomplished
   with appropriate ATC agencies.
   3.21.2. No more than four aircraft are in the flight.
 26                    AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


   3.21.3. No aircraft are offset from the runway in the direction of the break. The intent is to
   avoid requiring a tighter than normal turn to arrive on normal downwind.
   3.21.4. Normal downwind and base turn positions as well as formation spacing are flown.
3.22. Low Approaches.
   3.22.1. Minimum Altitudes.
      3.22.1.1. Normal and no-flap single ship low approaches: So that touchdown does not
      occur.

      circumstances dictate otherwise.
   3.22.2. Go-Around. During a go-around, remain 500 feet below VFR overhead traffic
   pattern altitude until crossing the departure end of the runway unless local procedures,
   missed approach/climb-out procedures, or ATC instructions dictate otherwise.
3.23. Landing.
   3.23.1. The desired touchdown point is 500-1000 feet past the runway threshold for a VFR
   pattern or 500-1000 feet past the Runway Point of Intercept (RPI) for a precision approach.
   3.23.2. Minimum pattern and touchdown spacing is IAW AFI 11-202V3 as supplemented by
   MAJCOM. F-15A-D and foreign variants are similar fighter type aircraft to the F-15E.
   Increase spacing whenever wake turbulence is anticipated.
   3.23.3. Normally, all aircraft will land in the center of the runway and clear to the cold
   (turnoff) side of the runway when speed and conditions permit.
   3.23.4. Landing Restrictions.
      3.23.4.1. When the computed landing roll exceeds 80 percent of the available runway,
      land at an alternate if possible.
      3.23.4.2. Do not land over any raised web barrier (e.g. MA-1A, 61QS11), or loose or
      slack cable (e.g. BAK-12/13/14)
      3.23.4.3. During the aerobrake portion of a normal, dry runway landing, leave flaps
      down to provide increased aerodynamic drag and normal nose fall.
      3.23.4.4. When the RCR at the base of intended landing is less than 12, land at an
      alternate if possible. If an alternate is not available, an approach end or mid-field
      arrestment is recommended.
3.24. Touch-and-Go Landings. Fly touch-and-go landings IAW AFI 11-202V3, as
supplemented by MAJCOM. Do not fly touch-and-go landings with any of the following:
   3.24.1. Live A/A or A/G ordnance (EXCEPTION: any 20mm ammunition).
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                                27


   3.24.2. Hung ordnance or gun malfunction of any kind.
   3.24.3. Fuel remaining in any external tank.
3.25. Closed Traffic Patterns.
   3.25.1. Initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway unless directed otherwise by
   local procedures or ATC.
   3.25.2. If executing a formation low approach, a sequential closed may be flown with ATC
   concurrence.
   3.25.3. Plan to arrive on downwind at 200-250 KCAS.
3.26. Back Seat Approaches and Landings. During back seat approaches and landings, the
front seat pilot will visually clear the area, monitor aircraft parameters and configurations, and be
prepared to direct a go-around or take control of the aircraft (as briefed by the rear cockpit pilot)
if necessary.
3.27. Formation Approaches and Landings.
   3.27.1. Normally accomplish formation landings from a precision approach. If not,
   accomplish the landing from any applicable published approach or a VFR straight-in using
   available approach path guidance (VASI, PAPI, PLASI, etc.). In all cases, use a rate of
   descent similar to a normal precision approach.
   3.27.2. CT formation landings must be led by a qualified flight lead unless an IP is in the
   element.
   3.27.3. Do not practice formation approaches with a combined fuel and stores weight greater
   than 10,000 pounds (N/A for FE Chase).
   3.27.4. Aircraft must be within 3,000 pounds weight of each other and symmetrically loaded
   as defined in para 3.7.3.
   3.27.5. Formation landings are prohibited when:
       3.27.5.1. The crosswind component exceeds 10 knots.
       3.27.5.2. The RSC (or primary braking portion of the runway for dual surface runways)
       is reported as wet; or slush, ice or snow is on the runway.

       any 20mm ammunition, chaff/flares).
       3.27.5.6. The weather is less than 500 feet ceiling and 1.5 miles (2.4 KM) or the highest
       Pilot Weather Category (PWC) in the flight, whichever is higher (except in an actual
       emergency requiring a formation landing).
3.28. After Shutdown Procedures. All flight members will accomplish a post flight walk-
around. The intent of this inspection is to find evidence of birdstrike, lost panels, damaged
ordnance, structural damage resulting from over-Gs, or other in-flight abnormalities.
 28                     AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


Section 3E—Night Procedures

   should be OFF and the position lights ON and not flashing.
   3.29.2. Taxi with a minimum of 300 feet spacing.
   3.29.3. Use the taxi light while taxiing unless it might interfere with an aircraft landing or
   taking off. The taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be visually cleared
   without the taxi light.
   3.29.4. Minimum required operational exterior lighting for night flying operations is:
   landing and taxi light, both wing-root anti-collision lights, both wingtip position lights, and at
   least one of the vertical stab lights, either the Left Vertical Stab (LVS) position light or the
   Right Vertical Stab (RVS) anti-collision light. Substituting a formation light in lieu of a
   wingtip position light is not permitted.
3.30. Night Takeoff.
   3.30.1. During a night formation takeoff, direct brake release and configuration changes on
   the radio.
   3.30.2. Following takeoff, each aircraft and element will climb on runway heading to 1,000
   feet AGL before initiating turns, except where departure instructions specifically preclude
   compliance.
3.31. Night Join-Up.
   3.31.1. Weather criteria for night join-up underneath a ceiling is minimum 3,000 feet ceiling
   and 5 miles (8 KM) visibility.
   3.31.2. After join-up, turn the anti-collision lights OFF, but keep position lights ON except
   for the last aircraft in formation. The last aircraft will keep the anti-collision lights ON
   unless otherwise directed by the flight lead.
3.32. Night Formation Procedures.
   3.32.1. When in trail formation maintain aircraft spacing primarily by instruments, radar,
   Air-to-Air Interrogator (AAI), and timing. If aircraft spacing cannot be ensured, then
   establish altitude separation (1,000 feet minimum). Cross-check instruments at all times to
   ensure ground clearance.
   3.32.2. Do not change lead or wing formation positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on
   RADAR downwind. Direct lead and position changes using the radio and from a stabilized,
   wings-level attitude.
   3.32.3. Prior to a formation break-up at night, the flight lead will transmit attitude, altitude,
   airspeed, and altimeter setting, which will be confirmed and acknowledged with ―good
   NAVAIDs‖ by the flight.
   3.32.4. Battle damage checks will not be performed at night without NVGs (see para 3.34.6)
3.33. Night TF Operations.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                           29


   3.33.1. A fully functioning TF system is required to conduct night TF operations (VMC or
   IMC).     In addition to the minimum equipment listed in para 3.18.5, a usable
   Navigation/Forward Looking Infrared (NAV/FLIR) HUD image is required. NVGs may be
   used in place of the NAV/FLIR.
   3.33.2. TF failure prior to low altitude entry: If the TF system fails prior to route entry,
   aircrew may still enter the route and continue the mission either at the MSA (or RAA if
   greater than 5NM from course) or by using NVG Procedures from para 3.34.
   3.33.3. TF failure while low altitude: Aircrews who experience failure of any portion of the
   TF system or NAV/FLIR imagery (or NVGs if used in place of the NAV/FLIR) while flying
   night TF low level will immediately climb to (or above) the MSA (or RAA if not within
   5NM of course) or transition to NVG procedures.
   3.33.4. Climb to MSA (or RAA if not within 5NM of course) when NAV/FLIR
   transmissivity or NVG visibility (if NVG is used in place of the NAV/FLIR) is insufficient
   for use as an aid for terrain avoidance (N/A for IMC TF qualified crews and supervised
   crews in an IMC TF upgrade using IMC procedures).
3.34. NVG Procedures.
   3.34.1. NVGs must be preflight tested and adjusted by the individual in the unit eyelane
   prior to NVG operations.
   3.34.2. Donning and doffing NVGs.
      3.34.2.1. NVGs must be off and secured during takeoff and landing.
      3.34.2.2. Do not don NVGs until at least 2,000 feet AGL in climbing or level flight.
      3.34.2.3. Remove NVGs prior to initial or the FAF or glide slope intercept.
      3.34.2.4. Flight members will communicate when donning or doffing NVGs. Only one
      crewmember per aircraft will don or doff NVGs at a time.
   3.34.3. NVGs will not be worn in IMC.
   3.34.4. Wingmen will fly no closer than NVG close formation (as defined in AFTTP 3-3.F-
   15E Chap 8).
   3.34.5. NVGs may be worn for tanker rejoins, but will be raised to the up and locked
   position or removed and stowed no later than the pre-contact position.
   3.34.6. Night BD Checks.
      3.34.6.1. Night BD checks are permitted only when wearing NVGs.
      3.34.6.2. The crew performing the BD check will approach with position lights bright
      and steady and beacons on while the aircraft being checked sets external lights to a
      minimum (with at least anti-collision beacons off).
   3.34.7. NVG Abnormal Procedures.
      3.34.7.1. During in-flight emergencies, immediately assess whether the NVGs aid or
      hinder completion of emergency procedures. If they are a hindrance or the emergency
      may deteriorate into an ejection situation, remove and stow the NVGs.
 30                      AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


       3.34.7.2. For NVG failure or inadvertent flight into weather while in formation or close
       proximity to other aircraft:

           completely if practical.
           3.34.7.2.5. Maintain or regain VMC as soon as possible.
       3.34.7.3. For NVG failure or inadvertent flight into weather while low altitude, ensure
       separation from other aircraft and climb to (or above) MSA (or RAA if not within 5 miles
       of course) prior to troubleshooting.
3.35. Night Landing.
   3.35.1. Normally land from an instrument straight-in approach. Refer to AFI 11-202V3,
   Chap 5, as supplemented, for specific procedures.
   3.35.2. Only perform night formation landings when required for safe recovery of the
   aircraft.

Section 3F—Miscellaneous Procedures

3.36. Change of Aircraft Control. Both aircrew members must know at all times who has
control of the aircraft. Use the statement "you have the aircraft" to transfer aircraft control. The
aircrew member receiving control of the aircraft will acknowledge "I have the aircraft" and
lightly shake the stick. Once assuming control of the aircraft, maintain control until
relinquishing it as stated above. EXCEPTION: If the intercom fails the pilot in the front
cockpit, if not already in control of the aircraft, will shake the stick and assume control of the
aircraft and radios unless otherwise prebriefed.
3.37. Ops Checks.
   3.37.1. Accomplish sufficient ops checks to ensure safe mission accomplishment. Each
   aircrew should monitor the fuel system carefully throughout the flight to identify low or
   trapped fuel or imbalance situations as soon as possible. Ops checks are required:
       3.37.1.1. During climb or at level-off after takeoff.
       3.37.1.2. Prior to each ACBT engagement or intercept. In addition, a check for proper
       operation of all transfer tanks (wing tanks balanced and tank 1 feeding) will be performed
       prior to and between engagements or planned maneuvering above 30 units Angle of
       Attack (AOA).
       3.37.1.3. Prior to entering an A/G range, at least once while on the range if multiple
       passes are made, and at least once after departing the range.
       3.37.1.4. Following Air Refueling.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                             31


   3.37.2. Minimum Ops Check items are engine instruments, total and internal fuel quantities
   and balance, G-suit connection, oxygen system, cabin altitude, and Overload Warning
   System (OWS).
   3.37.3. In formation flights, the flight lead may initiate ops checks by radio call or visual
   signal and wingmen will respond appropriately. The query and response for ops checks will
   include the following:
       3.37.3.1. Pointer over counter readings (e.g. "13 over 25, externals" or "13 over 18,
       CFTs").
       3.37.3.2. Following external wing tank and CFT fuel consumption, ensure tank one is
       feeding correctly; add a "balanced" call to the normal Ops Check reply when wing tank
       fuel balance checks are required and the difference is no greater than 200 lbs. (e.g. "8
       squared, balanced, tank 1") (EXCEPTION: Total fuel only may periodically be used
       during high demand phases of flight).
   3.37.4. Fighter Data Link (FDL) fuel status will not be used as the primary source of fuel
   checks.
3.38. F-15E Crew Duties. Both crewmembers are responsible for successful sortie completion.
They will perform a crew brief before each flight to ensure an understanding of all aspects of the
mission. Aircrew will reference AFTTPs 3-3.F15E and 3-1.F-15E for a thorough discussion of
F-15E crew coordination. Unless briefed otherwise, the following duties apply. (EXCEPTION:
The restrictions listed in para 3.38.2 may not be altered.)
   3.38.1. General. Brief radar and visual lookout responsibilities, crew coordination, and
   specific duties for each phase of flight.
   3.38.2. Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) Flying. WSOs will not fly during:
       3.38.2.1. Takeoff or landing.
       3.38.2.2. AAR operations.
       3.38.2.3. Close formation or rejoins to close formation.
       3.38.2.4. Tactical maneuvering.
       3.38.2.5. Weapons delivery (actual or simulated).
       3.38.2.6. Below 1,000 feet AGL (unless flying practice instrument approaches and no
       lower than non-precision approach minimums, the pilot's weather category, or 500' AGL,
       whichever is higher).
       3.38.2.7. Overhead patterns
   3.38.3. Takeoff. The WSO will check the Min go/Max abort speed when required, monitor
   engine and flight instruments, check gear and flaps up prior to their TO speed limits, and
   advise the pilot of any discrepancies.
   3.38.4. Climb/Departure. The aircrew member flying the aircraft will call altimeter setting
   to 29.92 when passing the transition altitude.
   3.38.5. Cruise, Navigation, and Instrument Flight. The WSO will relay aircraft attitude,
   altitude, and airspeed information to the pilot when departing a formation at night or in IMC.

   3.38.6. Air Refueling.
      3.38.6.1. Pilot Responsibilities. Be prepared to immediately use the air refueling
      release HOTAS if an IP/UIP in the RCP is accomplishing the refueling and either the
      RCP air refueling release button on the stick doesn’t work or safety dictates.
      3.38.6.2. WSO Responsibilities. Advise the pilot of boom position and call when boom
      is positively disconnected and clear.
   3.38.7. Instrument Penetrations and Descents.
      3.38.7.1. The aircrew member in control of the aircraft will advise the other crewmember
      of intentions when performing any penetration or approach.
      3.38.7.2. Both crewmembers must confirm the Decision Height (DH) or Minimum
      Descent Altitude (MDA) for an approach, or the RAA and MSA altitudes for descents
      into the low altitude environment.
      3.38.7.3. Both crewmembers will refer to appropriate FLIP publications during the
      holding, penetration and approach.
      3.38.7.4. The crewmember not in control of the aircraft will verbally check altimeter
      settings when passing the transition level.
      3.38.7.5. The crewmember not in control of the aircraft will advise the other
      crewmember when 1,000 feet above any intermediate level off altitude, 100 feet above
      DH or MDA for the approach being flown, or when 1000 feet above the minimum
      altitude during descents into the low altitude environment.
   3.38.8. Pattern and Landing. The crewmember not in control of the aircraft will:
      3.38.8.1. Monitor the pattern with emphasis on engine power, altitude, airspeed, landing
      gear, and flap position.
      3.38.8.2. Visually clear the area.
      3.38.8.3. Monitor ground speed versus runway remaining during the landing roll to
      assess aerobraking effectiveness and available stopping distance.
   3.38.9. After Landing. If an IP/UIP accomplished the landing from the RCP, the pilot in
   the FCP will assume control of the aircraft as briefed by the pilot in the RCP to perform the
   taxiing.
3.39. Identification Friend or Foe/Selective Identification Feature (IFF/SIF). Excessive
Mode 3/A and Mode 4 interrogations can cause ATC to momentarily drop surveillance tracks.
Aircrew may continue to interrogate Mode 3/A and 4 as operational, training, and safety
requirements dictate, but will minimize use in Range While Search (RWS) when pointed at
known high-density traffic areas. Interrogations in the more focused radar modes (e.g. STT,
TWS) have less impact upon ATC operations.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                              33


                                            Chapter 4

                               INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. In IMC the Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI) must be used as the primary
   attitude reference by the crewmember flying the aircraft. The F-15E HUD is not certified as
   a Primary Flight Reference (PFR) IAW AFI 11-217V1; therefore, it cannot be used as a sole
   attitude reference.
   4.1.2. The HUD is the primary reference for low level and TF operations.
   4.1.3. Do not use the HUD to recover from an unusual attitude or when executing lost
   wingman procedures except when no other attitude reference is available.
   4.1.4. The F-15E INS and EGI are approved for Enroute Area Navigation (RNAV);
   however, RNAV and GPS approaches are not authorized.
4.2. Takeoff and Join-Up.
   4.2.1. The flight lead must get an appropriate ATC clearance (altitude block or trail
   formation) when a flight join-up is not possible due to weather or operational requirements.
   4.2.2. Formation trail departures must comply with instructions for a nonstandard formation
   flight as defined in FLIP.
   4.2.3. If weather is below 1500 feet ceiling and 3 miles (5 KM) visibility, each aircraft and
   element will climb on takeoff heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating any turns, except
   when departure instructions specifically preclude compliance.
4.3. Trail Procedures.
   4.3.1. General.
      4.3.1.1. The flight lead must brief the flight on spacing, configuration and airspeeds in all
      phases of flight that trail formations will be flown.
      4.3.1.2. Flight leads will request non-standard formation from ATC.
      4.3.1.3. ATC instructions to the lead aircraft will be for the entire flight.
      4.3.1.4. Limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank.
   4.3.2. Trail Departure.
      4.3.2.1. Reference AFTTP 3-1.F-15E, para 3.6, for Trail Departure techniques.
      4.3.2.2. During trail formations basic instrument flying is the first priority. Strictly
      adhere to the briefed airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings, and turn points. If
      task saturation occurs, cease attempts to maintain trail, concentrate on flying the
      instrument departure, and then notify the flight lead. The flight lead will then notify
      ATC.
      4.3.2.3. Each aircraft or element will follow the No Radar Contact procedures until the
      aircraft or element immediately in trail has radar contact and called "tied."
34                    AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


     4.3.2.4. Use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff spacing.
  4.3.3. No Radar Contact.
     4.3.3.1. The flight lead will call initiating all turns. Subsequent aircraft must delay turns
     to maintain the desired spacing .
     4.3.3.2. Each aircraft and element will maintain 20 seconds or 2-3 mile spacing using all
     available aircraft systems and NAVAIDs to monitor position.
     4.3.3.3. During climbs and descents, each aircraft or element will call passing each 5,000
     foot altitude increment with altitude and heading (or heading passing) until join-up, level-
     off, or the following aircraft or element calls "tied."
     4.3.3.4. Each aircraft and element will call initiating any altitude or heading changes.
     Acknowledgments are not required; however, it is imperative that preceding aircraft or
     elements monitor the radio transmissions and progress of the succeeding aircraft and
     elements, and immediately correct deviations from the planned route.
     4.3.3.5. Each aircraft and element will maintain at least 1,000 feet vertical separation
     from the preceding aircraft or element until establishing radar or visual contact except in
     instances where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. Reduce vertical
     separation to 500 feet if necessary to comply with MSA restrictions.
     4.3.3.6. In the event a visual join-up cannot be accomplished on top or at level-off, the
     flight lead will request altitude separation for each succeeding aircraft or element to meet
     the requirements of the above paragraph.
  4.3.4. Radar Contact.
     4.3.4.1. Each aircraft and element will call "tied" when radar contact is established with
     the preceding aircraft.
     4.3.4.2. Once all aircraft are tied, no further radio calls are required unless radar contact
     is lost.
     4.3.4.3. In flights of three or more aircraft, use all available aircraft systems (i.e. radar,
     TACAN, AAI, FDL, etc.) to ensure that trail is maintained on the correct aircraft.
  4.3.5. En route Trail. Flight leads must brief airspeeds, power settings, and configurations.
  4.3.6. Trail Recovery.
     4.3.6.1. Trail recoveries are only authorized at home station and designated deployed
     locations. Appropriate ATC agencies must approve and local operating procedures must
     address trail recovery procedures. As a minimum, procedures must address each
     recovery profile, missed approach, climb-out, desired and maximum spacing
     requirements, lost contact, and lost communications.
     4.3.6.2. Limit trail recovery to a maximum of four aircraft.
     4.3.6.3. Trail recoveries are authorized when weather at the base of intended landing is at
     or above the highest PWC in the flight or approach minimums, whichever is higher.
     4.3.6.4. Prior to taking spacing the flight lead must do the following:
         4.3.6.4.1. Coordinate the trail recovery with ATC prior to taking spacing.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                                35


          4.3.6.4.2. Ensure that all wingmen have ‖good NAVAIDS‖ and an A/A radar.
          4.3.6.4.3. Accomplish the spacing maneuver in VMC to the max extent possible.
      4.3.6.5. Once established on a segment of a published approach, each aircraft must
      comply with all published altitudes and restrictions while maintaining in-trail separation.
      4.3.6.6. Unless local procedures establish defined reference points for airspeed and
      configuration changes, the flight lead must direct changes by radio. At flight lead's call
      all aircraft must simultaneously comply with the directed change.
      4.3.6.7. All aircraft must report the FAF or glide slope intercept.
      4.3.6.8. Lost Contact. If contact is lost with the preceding aircraft, the following will be
      accomplished:
          4.3.6.8.1. The pilot will transmit, "Callsign (C/S), lost contact."
          4.3.6.8.2. The preceding aircraft will respond with altitude, airspeed, and heading.
          4.3.6.8.3. If contact is lost while established on a segment of a published approach,
          flight members may continue the approach, but must confirm separation via
          navigation aids.
          4.3.6.8.4. If separation cannot be confirmed, execute missed approach or climb-out
          as instructed by ATC.
4.4. Formation Split-Up.
   4.4.1. Accomplish formation split-ups in VMC to the max extent possible.
   4.4.2. If IMC, accomplish the split-up in straight and level flight.
   4.4.3. Prior to a split-up in IMC, the flight lead must transmit attitude, airspeed, altitude, and
   altimeter setting which will be acknowledged by wingmen. Wingmen must confirm good
   NAVAIDS.
4.5. Formation Penetration.
   4.5.1. Restrict formation penetrations to two aircraft when the weather at the base of
   intended landing is less than overhead traffic pattern minimums.
   4.5.2. If a formation landing is intended, position the wingman on the appropriate wing prior
   to weather penetration.
4.6. IMC Lead Change. During IMC formation flights, do not change leads below 1,500 feet
AGL unless on RADAR downwind.
4.7. Approach Procedures.
   4.7.1. Aircrew will not fly any published instrument approach procedure (e.g. DoD,
   Jeppesen, ICAO) that requires airspeeds less than those specified in the TO.
   4.7.2. The F-15E is Approach Category E. Use Approach Category D minimums at an
   emergency or divert airfield where no Category E minimums are published, provided:
      4.7.2.1. A straight-in approach is flown.
      4.7.2.2. For the final approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 165 KCAS or less.
36                   AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


     4.7.2.3. For the missed approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 255 knots true airspeed
     (KTAS) or less. In those cases where a high density altitude may cause 255 KTAS to
     equal a KCAS below the speeds specified in TO 1F-15E-1, Cat D approaches shall not be
     flown.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                           37

                        AIR-TO-AIR WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

5.1. References. AFI 11-214 contains A/A procedures and restrictions, to include operations
with live ordnance applicable to all aircraft. This chapter contains procedures and restrictions
specific to F-15E operations.
5.2. Simulated Gun Employment.
   5.2.1. Simulated A/A gun employment is defined as use of Master Arm and trigger actuation
   during a practice gun attack against airborne targets.
   5.2.2. Always confirm the status of the gun system prior to flight IAW TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-
   CL-1.
   5.2.3. Simulated A/A gun employment may be performed with a loaded gun provided the
   gun is safed and a trigger check is accomplished. Point the aircraft away from other aircraft
   and inhabited areas during any trigger check.
   5.2.4. Never perform simulated A/A gun employment with a hot gun (one that is not safed
   IAW TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-CL-1). Never perform a trigger check with a hot gun, regardless of
   Master Arm switch position.
5.3. Maneuvering Limitations.
   5.3.1. Minimum airspeed during LOWAT maneuvering is 350 KCAS.
   5.3.2. When configured with three external tanks, aircraft will operate under the LIMITED
   maneuvering category.
   5.3.3. When configured with external wing tanks only (e.g. no centerline fuel tank),
   UNLIMITED maneuvering is allowed once the externals are empty (flight manual
   restrictions still apply).
   5.3.4. Negative-G guns jinks are prohibited.
   5.3.5. When acting as a restricted maneuvering target for low altitude intercepts, the
   minimum airspeed is 300 KCAS.
   5.3.6. A/A tactical maneuvering (ACBT and unlimited or limited maneuvering intercepts) is
   prohibited when wing fuel imbalance results in a 30 unit restriction IAW TO 1F-15E-1 Ch 5
   and Ch 6. When the imbalance is corrected to within TO limits, the briefed mission can be
   continued.

                     AIR-TO-SURFACE WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

6.1. References. AFI 11-214 contains A/G procedures and restrictions applicable to all aircraft.
This chapter contains procedures and restrictions specific to F-15E operations.
6.2. Simulated Attacks against Off-Range or Manned Targets. May be conducted, to
include use of Master Arm and A/G Master Mode, when carrying practice ordnance under the
following restrictions:
   6.2.1. No live or carted heavyweight inert A/G ordnance, or live A/A missiles are loaded.
   6.2.2. The A/G training mode is used on the Programmable Armament Control Set (PACS).
   6.2.3. Stations loaded with carted practice ordnance are not selected on the training PACS.
   6.2.4. The combat laser may be used only in approved areas.
   6.2.5. Simulated Strafe.
       6.2.5.1. Simulated strafe is defined as the combined use of Master Arm and trigger
       actuation during a practice gun attack against ground targets.
       6.2.5.2. Simulated strafe is permitted with a safed gun, loaded or unloaded, provided a
       trigger check is previously accomplished.
       6.2.5.3. Do not perform simulated strafe (as defined in para 6.2.5.1) with a hot gun
       (loaded or empty).
6.3. Pop-Up Attacks. Abort pop-up attacks if airspeed decreases below 350 KCAS (300 KCAS
above 10,000 feet AGL).
6.4. TF System Delivery Procedures.
   6.4.1. Maximum angle of bank during night recovery maneuvers (from loft or climbing safe
   escape) is 135 degrees.
   6.4.2. When performing weapons deliveries on a range using only TF procedures (e.g.
   NVGs are not used) all maneuvering in the bombing pattern below MSA will be inside TF
   limits.
   6.4.3. TF Loft Deliveries.
       6.4.3.1. TF loft deliveries are instrument maneuvers that exceed numerous TF limits.
       Aircrew will reference AFTTP 3-3.F-15E Chapter 8 for a comprehensive list of delivery
       and recovery procedures and considerations.
       6.4.3.2. The TF loft escape corridor is defined as a 10NM wide corridor centered on
       planned flight path, starting at the planned roll out point and extending for 8NM along the
       egress heading. Aircrew will calculate and annotate both an RIA and MSA for every
       planned escape corridor.
       6.4.3.3. Prior to TF loft deliveries both aircrew will verify accuracy of their standby ADI
       against an EADI and verbalize inter-cockpit ―ADI up‖.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                           39


      6.4.3.4. If the TF system fails during recovery, maintain the appropriate minimum
      altitude (RAA, MSA, or NVG minimum) until the TF system recovers.
      6.4.3.5. If at any time during the TF loft delivery or recovery airspeed drops below 300
      KCAS, abort the maneuver and recover to level flight. Direct primary emphasis towards
      aircraft attitude, altitude, and regaining airspeed.
6.5. Night and IMC Surface Attack Range Procedures.
   6.5.1. For night range weapons deliveries, the weather must allow the Range Control Officer
   (RCO) (for a class A range), or a flight member or range personnel (for a class B or C range)
   to clear the target area and spot or score the ordnance impact.
   6.5.2. Multiple weapons deliveries may be accomplished at night and/or during IMC if range
   patterns and procedures that ensure positive aircraft separation are established and briefed.
      6.5.2.1. TF altitude and maneuvering restrictions apply throughout the pattern for TF
      deliveries. If the downwind is flown at MSA or above do not begin a TF descent to the
      planned delivery altitude until in a position to remain within TF limits.
      6.5.2.2. Minimum pattern altitude for non-TF deliveries is MSA or above, range
      restrictions permitting, unless complying with para 3.34 (NVG Procedures).
   6.5.3. For IMC range deliveries through or above the weather comply with the applicable
   Range Orders and the following restrictions:
      6.5.3.1. A fully functional Present Position Keeping Source (PPKS) must be selected for
      delivery. Use of EGI PPKS requires a GPS accuracy of 50' or better and a star to indicate
      blended solution.
      6.5.3.2. Ballistic Ordnance.
          6.5.3.2.1. Use of MN or INS PPKS requires a system altitude update within five
          minutes prior to release.
          6.5.3.2.2. A target direct and minimum of one target offset High Resolution Map
          (HRM) patch maps (1.3 NM or better) are required for radar target designation.
          6.5.3.2.3. Nav target designation will only be used with EGI PPKS. Verify target
          coordinates against published range coordinates to ensure on-range impact.
      6.5.3.3. Inertially Aided Munitions (IAM).
          6.5.3.3.1. Verify Smart Weapons Page target coordinates against published range
          coordinates.
          6.5.3.3.2. Verify weapon navigation solution quality is at least MARGINAL 1 or
          better and no warning messages or weapon DGRD or FAIL cues are on the Smart
          Weapons Page.
          6.5.3.3.3. Release in the IN-ZONE LAR or at the planned DGR if no LAR exists.

      areas.
      7.1.4.3. Ensure the dump switch is returned to normal before landing.
      7.1.4.4. After landing, make an appropriate entry in the AFTO Forms 781.
   7.1.5. Do not taxi aircraft with malfunctions that effect the nosewheel steering or brake
   system.
   7.1.6. Flight Control Malfunctions.
      7.1.6.1. For actual or perceived flight control malfunctions, terminate maneuvering and
      take appropriate action.
      7.1.6.2. If the flight control problem was due to crew member or passenger stick or
      rudder interference, the pilot will take appropriate action to ensure no further flight
      control interference occurs.
7.2. Ground Aborts.
   7.2.1. Delayed aircraft may join the flight at a briefed rendezvous point or may fly a briefed
   alternate single ship mission.
   7.2.2. If accomplishing a join-up to spread, route, or fingertip, cease tactical maneuvering
   until the delayed aircraft is joined and all flight members are ready to continue.
   7.2.3. Delayed flight members may join a fight in progress if pre-briefed by the flight lead.
7.3. Takeoff Aborts.
   7.3.1. If aborting the takeoff, clear to the appropriate side of the runway as expeditiously as
   possible based on position within the element. If this is not feasible because of possible cable
   engagement, clear straight ahead.
   7.3.2. As soon as practical, give call sign and state intentions on appropriate frequency or
   frequencies. A "Cable, Cable, Cable" radio call indicates intent for a departure-end
   arrestment.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                                 41


   7.3.3. Lower the tailhook if there is any doubt about the ability to stop on the runway.
   7.3.4. When applying the brakes above 120 KCAS during a takeoff abort or hot brakes are
   suspected declare a ground emergency, taxi the aircraft to the designated hot brake area and
   follow hot brake procedures. See TO 1F-15E-1 Section 3 for list of brake overheat
   considerations.
   7.3.5. Subsequent aircraft will hold position, abort, or takeoff as appropriate to maintain
   adequate clearance.
7.4. Air Aborts.
   7.4.1. If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original ATC call sign.
   7.4.2. Chase emergency air aborts to the field of intended landing. The flight lead will
   determine if a chase is required for non-emergency aborts.
   7.4.3. Abort the mission and land out of a straight-in approach, regardless of apparent
   damage or subsequent normal operation, for any of the following:
      7.4.3.1. Birdstrike or Foreign Object Damage (FOD).
      7.4.3.2. Flight control system anomalies (not including flight control system lights that
      reset IAW TO procedures).
      7.4.3.3. Engine flameout, stagnation, or shutdown.
   7.4.4. If an aircraft experiences an over-G, use the following procedures:
      7.4.4.1. Immediately terminate maneuvering and call up the OWS matrix to analyze the
      displayed parameters.
      7.4.4.2. If level "1" (one) is displayed in any column of the matrix except Mass Items
      (MIT), perform a BD check with emphasis on the overall condition of the aircraft. If no
      abnormalities are noted, the flight lead may continue the briefed mission. If a subsequent
      level "1" or greater over-G occurs, terminate the mission, perform a BD check, RTB, and
      fly a straight-in approach.
      7.4.4.3. If level "1" (one) is displayed in the MIT column, or level "2" (two) or greater is
      displayed in any column of the matrix, terminate the mission, perform a BD check, RTB,
      and fly a straight-in approach.
      7.4.4.4. After landing, document all over-Gs in the AFTO Form 781.
7.5. Radio Failure.
   7.5.1. General. In addition to this volume, individual aircraft experiencing radio failure will
   comply with procedures outlined in FLIP, AFI 11-202V3, Host Nation, and local directives.
   Aircraft experiencing any difficulty or emergency in addition to NORDO will proceed as
   required by the situation.
   7.5.2. Formation.
      7.5.2.1. Close or Route.
42                   AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


        7.5.2.1.1. Flight members who experience total radio failure while in close or route
        formation will maneuver within formation parameters to attract the attention of
        another flight member and give the appropriate visual signals.
        7.5.2.1.2. Terminate the mission as soon as practical and lead the NORDO aircraft to
        the base of intended landing or a divert base.
        7.5.2.1.3. Perform a formation approach to a drop-off on final unless safety
        considerations dictate otherwise.
     7.5.2.2. Other Than Close or Route.
        7.5.2.2.1. If flying other than close or route formation when radio failure occurs, the
        NORDO aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position at approximately 500 feet
        on another flight member.
        7.5.2.2.2. The NORDO aircraft is responsible for maintaining clearances from other
        flight members until his presence is acknowledged by a wing rock, signifying
        clearance to join.
        7.5.2.2.3. Once joined, the NORDO aircraft will give the appropriate visual signals.
        7.5.2.2.4. If pre-briefed, the NORDO aircraft may proceed to a rendezvous point and
        hold.
        7.5.2.2.5. NORDO aircraft will proceed to the base of intended landing or a divert
        base upon reaching the minimum fuel required for a NORDO recovery (not below
        BINGO) regardless of rejoin status.
  7.5.3. Surface Attack NORDO Procedures.
     7.5.3.1. Aircrew will reference AFTTP 3-3.F-15E, Chapter 5, for a comprehensive list of
     Surface Attack NORDO procedures for safe flight management.
     7.5.3.2. Jettison of Unexpended Ordnance. If radio failure occurs and circumstances
     preclude landing with unexpended ordnance, accomplish a safe jettison of the ordnance
     provided the following conditions are met:
        7.5.3.2.1. The NORDO aircraft joins on another flight member that has radio contact
        with the remainder of the flight and the RCO (on a manned range).
        7.5.3.2.2. Stores jettison visual signals specified in AFI 11-205 (hold fist at top of
        canopy and make several pumping motions) are relayed to the NORDO aircraft to
        initiate jettison.
  7.5.4. NORDO Recovery.
     7.5.4.1. Go-around.
        7.5.4.1.1. The chase aircraft will go-around, pass the NORDO aircraft, and rock his
        wings.
        7.5.4.1.2. The NORDO aircraft will go-around if in a safe position to do so.
        7.5.4.1.3. If the NORDO aircraft is in formation as a wingman, the lead will initiate a
        gentle turn into the wingman and begin the go-around.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                             43


       7.5.4.2. Approach End Arrestment.
          7.5.4.2.1. The NORDO aircraft will signal intent for an approach-end cable
          engagement to the chase aircraft by extending the tailhook.
          7.5.4.2.2. The pilot of a non-escorted NORDO aircraft intending to make an
          approach-end cable engagement will fly a straight-in approach flashing the landing
          light on final to signal the tower.
7.6. Severe Weather Penetration. If unavoidable, flight leads should split up the flight and
obtain separate clearances prior to severe weather penetration.
7.7. Lost Wingman Procedures. In any lost wingman situation, immediate separation of
aircraft is essential.
   7.7.1. General Procedures. Upon losing sight of the flight/element lead or if unable to
   maintain formation the wingman will simultaneously:
       7.7.1.1. Transition to instruments.
       7.7.1.2. Execute the applicable lost wingman procedures.
       7.7.1.3. Inform lead by transmitting "C/S, lost wingman."
       7.7.1.4. Flight/Element lead must acknowledge the lost wingman's radio call and, when
       appropriate, transmit attitude, heading, altitude, airspeed, and other parameters necessary
       for safe separation.
       7.7.1.5. When able, obtain a separate clearance.
       7.7.1.6. Observe all published terrain clearance limits.
       7.7.1.7. If a wingman becomes separated and any aircraft experiences radio failure, the
       aircraft with the operational radio will obtain a separate clearance for both aircraft.
          7.7.1.7.1. The NORDO aircraft will squawk code 7600 while proceeding with the
          last known clearance.
          7.7.1.7.2. If an emergency situation arises along with radio failure, the NORDO
          aircraft will turn the IFF to EMERGENCY for the remainder of the flight.
       7.7.1.8. After executing lost wingman procedures, wingman will not attempt to rejoin
       with the flight until the flight lead clears the wingman to do so.
       7.7.1.9. Only practice lost wingman procedures in VMC.
   7.7.2. Two and Three-Ship Procedures (NOTE: For three-ship echelon, refer to four-ship
   procedures.):
       7.7.2.1. Wings-Level Flight (Climbing, Descending, or Straight and Level). Turn
       away using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds, then resume original heading.
       7.7.2.2. Turns.
          7.7.2.2.1. Outside the Turn. Reverse the direction of turn using 15 degrees of bank
          for 15 seconds. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to resuming the
          turn.
 44                      AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


          7.7.2.2.2. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation
          and direct the flight lead to roll out of the turn. Maintain the original turn. The lead
          may only resume the turn when separation is ensured.
       7.7.2.3. Final Approach. Momentarily turn away from lead to ensure clearance and
       execute the published missed approach procedure.
       7.7.2.4. Missed Approach. Momentarily turn away from lead to ensure clearance and
       continue the published or assigned missed approach procedure while climbing to 500 feet
       above missed approach altitude.
   7.7.3. Three-Ship Echelon and Four-Ship Procedures. Number 2 and 3 follow the
   procedures outlined above. Number 4's initial action assumes that number 3 has also gone
   lost wingman:
       7.7.3.1. Wings-Level Flight (Climbing, Descending, or Straight and Level). Turn
       away using 30 degrees of bank for 30 seconds, then resume the original heading.
       7.7.3.2. Turns.
          7.7.3.2.1. Outside the Turn. Reverse direction of turn using 30 degrees of bank for
          30 seconds to ensure separation from lead and number 3.
          7.7.3.2.2. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation
          and increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Direct the flight lead to roll out. The flight
          lead will only resume the turn when separation is ensured.
   7.7.4. Fighter – tanker lost wingman procedures are governed by ATP-56(B), Air-to-Air
   Refueling.
7.8. Spatial Disorientation (SD). Conditions which prevent a clear visual horizon or increase
pilot tasking are conducive to SD. To prevent SD, the pilot must increase his instrument cross-
check rate. If SD symptoms are encountered:
   7.8.1. Single Ship.
       7.8.1.1. Concentrate on flying basic instruments with frequent reference to the EADI or
       standby ADI if no EADI is available.
       7.8.1.2. Minimize use of the HUD.
       7.8.1.3. Consider turning on the autopilot or transferring control to the other
       crewmember.
       7.8.1.4. If symptoms persist and conditions permit, fly straight and level until symptoms
       abate.
       7.8.1.5. If necessary, declare an emergency and advise ATC.
       7.8.1.6. It is possible for SD to proceed to the point where the aircrew is unable to see or
       interpret the flight instruments. In this situation, aircraft control may be impossible. If
       this occurs, the aircrew should consider ejecting.
   7.8.2. Flight/Element Lead.
       7.8.2.1. Advise the Wingmen of the disorientation and comply with procedures in
       paragraph 7.8.1.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                               45


      7.8.2.2. Use the Wingmen to confirm attitude and provide verbal feedback.
      7.8.2.3. If symptoms persist, terminate the mission and recover the flight by the simplest
      and safest means possible.
   7.8.3. Wingman.
      7.8.3.1. Advise lead of the disorientation.
      7.8.3.2. Lead will advise wingman of aircraft attitude, altitude, heading, and airspeed.
      7.8.3.3. If symptoms persist and conditions permit, lead will establish straight and level
      flight for 30-60 seconds.
      7.8.3.4. If the above procedures are not effective flight lead should consider passing the
      lead to the wingman, provided the flight lead will be able to maintain situational
      awareness from a chase position.
          7.8.3.4.1. Change leads while in straight and level flight.
          7.8.3.4.2. Once assuming the lead, maintain straight and level flight for at least 60
          seconds if practical.
      7.8.3.5. If necessary, terminate the tactical mission and recover by the simplest and
      safest means possible.
   7.8.4. Greater Than Two-Ship Formation.
      7.8.4.1. Lead should separate the flight into elements to more effectively handle a
      wingman with persistent SD symptoms.
      7.8.4.2. Accomplish split-up IAW para 4.4 (Formation Split-up).
      7.8.4.3. Plan to keep the element with the SD pilot straight and level while the other
      element separates.
7.9. Armament System Malfunctions.
   7.9.1. General. Aircrew will not attempt to expend ordnance with a known weapons release
   malfunction.
   7.9.2. Inadvertent Release or Firing.
      7.9.2.1. Note switch positions at the time of inadvertent release or firing and provide to
      armament and safety personnel. Record the impact point if known.
      7.9.2.2. Safe the armament switches and do not attempt further release or firing in any
      mode. Treat remaining ordnance as hung and follow hung ordnance procedures during
      RTB.
      7.9.2.3. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison them in a suitable area on
      a single pass, if practical.
   7.9.3. Failure to Release, Failure to Fire, or Hung Ordnance. Note switch positions and
   PACS settings. If ordnance delivery failed with proper setup, proceed as follows:
      7.9.3.1. Live Bombs.
          7.9.3.1.1. Attempt to release store(s) using an alternate delivery mode.
46                     AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


         7.9.3.1.2. If unsuccessful, attempt to jettison store(s) using selective jettison
         procedures.
         7.9.3.1.3. Lastly, consider attempting to selectively jettison the pylon if ordnance is
         unsecured or security cannot be determined.
         7.9.3.1.4. All release and fuze settings should be noted, then safe the system.
         7.9.3.1.5. If bombs remain on the aircraft, follow the Hung Ordnance and Weapons
         Malfunction Recovery procedures.
     7.9.3.2. Practice or Inert Bombs.
         7.9.3.2.1. Re-check switch positions and make an additional attempt to expend.
         7.9.3.2.2. If no release occurs, select an alternate delivery mode in an attempt to
         expend.
         7.9.3.2.3. If the secondary release mode fails, bombs from other stations and
         dispensers may be released providing the aircraft remains within symmetrical load
         limits. Upon RTB, follow the Hung Ordnance and Weapons Malfunction Recovery
         procedures.
  7.9.4. Missile Malfunctions.
     7.9.4.1. When abnormal missile launch or erratic missile flight is noted after launch,
     visually inspect the launching aircraft to determine if any damage has occurred.
     7.9.4.2. A missile that fires but fails to depart the aircraft is a hangfire. If this occurs, the
     missile should be closely observed and safety checked by a chase pilot.
     7.9.4.3. A missile that fails to fire when all appropriate switches were selected is a
     misfire.
     7.9.4.4. For either a hangfire or misfire safe the Master Arm switch and follow the Hung
     Ordnance and Weapons Malfunction Recovery procedures.
  7.9.5. Gun Malfunctions.
     7.9.5.1. For a hung or jammed gun immediately cease the delivery and safe the system.
     7.9.5.2. Do NOT attempt to use the gun again or further damage could result.
     7.9.5.3. If the HUD gun cross is on after selecting Master Arm Safe or the gun cannot be
     verified safe, upon landing recover to a designated Hot Gun area.
     7.9.5.4. Follow the Hung Ordnance and Weapons Malfunction Recovery procedures.
  7.9.6. Hung Ordnance and Weapons Malfunction Recovery.
     7.9.6.1. If practical, obtain a chase aircraft and visually inspect the aircraft for damage.
     7.9.6.2. Declare an emergency when carrying hung or malfunctioning live ordnance, to
     include 20mm HEI.
     7.9.6.3. Declaration of an emergency for hung practice or inert ordnance, 20mm TP, or
     live unexpended ordnance is IAW local directives and aircrew discretion.
     7.9.6.4. Avoid populated areas and trail formations.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                              47


       7.9.6.5. Land from a straight-in approach.
7.10. Post Arresting Gear Engagement Procedures.
   7.10.1. Do not shut down the engine(s) unless directed by the ground crew, there is a fire, or
   safety dictates.
   7.10.2. Raise the tailhook only on the ground crew's signal.
   7.10.3. Do not taxi until directed.
7.11. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures.
   7.11.1. A Simulated Emergency Procedure is defined as any procedure that produces an
   effect which closely parallels an actual emergency, such as retarding the throttle to simulate a
   flamed out engine.
   7.11.2. Only practice aborted takeoffs in the simulator, Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT),
   or, if the trainer is unavailable, a static aircraft.
   7.11.3. Simulated in-flight loss of both engines is prohibited.
   7.11.4. Practice in-flight engine shutdown is prohibited.
   7.11.5. Emergency Landing Patterns (also refer to AFI 11-202V3).
       7.11.5.1. Field Requirements. Practice of emergency landing patterns at active airfields
       is authorized provided that crash rescue and ATC facilities are available and in operation.
       7.11.5.2. Supervisory       Requirements. IQT        pilots    prior    to    the    initial
       instrument/qualification evaluation require an IP on board the aircraft or in chase. After
       the initial instrument/qualification evaluation, supervision will be an IP/IWSO on board
       the aircraft or in chase. MQT pilots require a SOF in place and an IP or flight lead
       monitoring from the traffic pattern.
       7.11.5.3. Pattern Procedures.
           7.11.5.3.1. Include the type of practice emergency pattern in the gear down call.
           7.11.5.3.2. Practice Single-Engine Go-Arounds.
               7.11.5.3.2.1. Initiate practice single-engine go-arounds in sufficient time to
               ensure the aircraft does not descend below 300 feet AGL.
               7.11.5.3.2.2. Simulated single-engine approaches may descend below 300 feet
               AGL provided the approach terminates in a full stop landing or the go-around
               from a low approach or touch and go landing is performed with both engines.
7.12. Search and Rescue (SAR) Procedures. If an aircraft crashes, immediately attempt to
locate possible survivors and initiate rescue efforts. Expect that the aircrew may initially suffer
from shock or have delayed reactions due to ejection injuries. The following procedures are not
exhaustive and should be adjusted to meet each unique search and rescue situation.
   7.12.1. Knock off maneuvering.
   7.12.2. Establish an On-Scene Commander (usually the wingman of the aircraft that is
   down).
 48                    AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


   7.12.3. Notify ATC or Ground Controlled Intercept (GCI) of the emergency situation.
   Squawk 7700 if requested by control agency.
   7.12.4. Communicate the emergency situation, aircraft involved, and flight intentions
   immediately to applicable control agencies. Use GUARD (UHF and/or VHF) if necessary.
   7.12.5. Mark the last known position of survivors (and the crash site if practical) using any
   means available (e.g. TACAN, EGI/INS, ATC/GCI, visual references).
   7.12.6. Remain above the highest ejection altitude, if known, or the highest observed
   parachute until determining the position of all possible survivors.
   7.12.7. Deconflict other aircraft assisting in SAR by altitude to preclude midair collision.
   Establish high and low CAPs as necessary to facilitate communications.
   7.12.8. Revise BINGO fuels or recovery bases as required to maintain maximum SARCAP
   coverage. Do not overfly the adjusted BINGO fuel.
   7.12.9. Relinquish SAR operation to designated rescue forces upon their arrival.
   7.12.10. Follow local or briefed procedures.
7.13. Lateral Asymmetry. Reference TO 1F-15E-1, Chapter 5, for restrictions associated with
lateral asymmetries.
   7.13.1. When a fuel imbalance develops that exceeds TO 1F-15E-1 limits for maneuvering
   above 30 units AOA, terminate maneuvering and investigate.
   7.13.2. If the imbalance was caused by a slow feeding CFT, external, or internal wing tank,
   restrict flight operations to instrument procedures, deployment missions, level/climbing
   weapons deliveries, or restricted maneuvering intercepts, until the imbalance is corrected.
   7.13.3. If the fuel imbalance cannot be corrected, terminate the mission. However, the
   events listed in para 7.13.2 may be flown to reduce gross weight.
7.14. Engine Malfunctions. Report all engine anomalies during maintenance debrief.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                            49

                          LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

8.1. General. This chapter is reserved for unit local operating procedures. IAW AFI 33-360,
the paragraph method is the only authorized way to supplement an AFI and added material must
be arranged according to the basic publication. Units composed of dissimilar aircraft may
publish guidance in a single, stand-alone local operating instruction (OI) instead of
supplementing this AFI. Added or stand-alone procedures will not be less restrictive than those
contained elsewhere in this volume. This chapter is not intended to be a single source document
for procedures contained in other directives or regulations. Avoid unnecessary repetition of
guidance provided in other established directives; however, reference to those directives is
acceptable when it serves to facilitate location of information necessary for local operating
procedures. This chapter is authorized to be issued to each F-15E crewmember. Units may
supplement the following paragraphs for local operating guidance:
   8.1.1. Section A. Introduction.
       8.1.1.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) GENERAL:
          8.1.1.1.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) This chapter provides standard
          procedures to be used by all F-15E aircrew operating from Seymour Johnson AFB,
          NC. Aircrews should refer to SJAFBI 11-250, Airfield Operations and the 4 OG
          Aircrew Aid for local ATC procedures, illustrations of the local area, working area
          descriptions, and divert information. This supplement is directive in nature; however,
          if more restrictive guidance is published (AFI change, FCIF, Read File, Squadron OI)
          the more restrictive guidance will be applied. This chapter applies, as appropriate, to
          other units operating from SJAFB. Commanders and supervisors will ensure
          compliance with AFI 11-2F-15EV3 to include this supplement. 4th Operations
          Group Commander (4 OG/CC) approval is required for deviations from this chapter.
          Use AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to submit
          recommended changes. 4th Operations Group Stan/Eval Division (4 OG/OGV) will
          evaluate and publish changes to this supplement with 4 OG/CC concurrence. 4 FW
          deployed units will comply with this chapter and deployed local procedures. If
          Chapter 8 procedures are inappropriate for deployed operations, the deployed
          commander will ensure deployed procedures are established.
       8.1.1.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) COMMAND AND CONTROL:
          8.1.1.2.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) All 4 FW flying operations will be
          approved by the 4 OG/CC. This includes cross-country, ferry, operational check
          flights, and functional check flights.
          8.1.1.2.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) In the event that ePEX fails or
          crashes, flying units will advise the SOF, Airfield Management and Command Post of
          all aircrew, tail number, and mission changes as they occur.
          8.1.1.2.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The SOF has the authority to
          recall or divert flights.

         8.1.1.2.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) 4 OG/CC approval is required to
         take cameras in the cockpit.
  8.1.2. Section B. General Policy.
     8.1.2.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) These operating procedures are
     designed to increase combat capability, adhere to peacetime restrictions, and minimize
     inherent risks.
  8.1.3. Section C. Ground Operations.
     8.1.3.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) FLIGHT PLANS:
         8.1.3.1.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) File flight plans through squadron
         operations desk or by DD Form 175/1801, Military Flight Plan/DOD International
         Flight Plan, with the stereo flight plan name in the remark section by hotline/fax
         (722-4097/4100) prior to briefing. Flying squadrons must retain the original DD
         Form 175/1801 on file for 90 days. Local canned, stereo and split recovery coded
         flight plans are listed in the 4 OG Aircrew Aid. IAW SJAFBI 11-250 all flight plans
         (stereo/cross country) will be submitted at least one hour prior to departure.
             8.1.3.1.1.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Prior to taxi, the flight lead
             will call Seymour Clearance Delivery and, if appropriate, specify the requested
             stereo. Clearance Delivery will verify the stated request and issue the IFR
             clearance and a squawk for the flight. Clearance Delivery will advise aircrew to
             contact squadron operations to re-file if the requested flight plan is unavailable or
             different from the available flight plan. If Clearance Delivery does not have a
             clearance at taxi time, the aircrew will contact Ground for taxi instructions and
             expect to receive an advisory call on Ground when the IFR clearance is available.
         8.1.3.1.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) VFR departures are available as a
         last resort if an IFR flight plan is not available and the flight needs to depart.
         Coordinate with Tower and the SOF for a VFR departure and expect a local squawk.
         8.1.3.1.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Split Recoveries: Flights may
         depart as a four/two-ship and recover as two/single-ships (or other combination). To
         fly split recoveries, file an ―R‖ flight plan(s) for each separately returning flight or
         aircraft. Example, LION 11 flight of four files a Beach 4 and LION 13 files a Beach
         4R for a separate recovery. To obtain individual IFR clearances, depart the working
         area with at least 2 minutes (8 miles minimum) separation.
         8.1.3.1.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) MARSA               Procedures:      When
         applying MARSA at Seymour Johnson, aircrews must file separate flight plans with
         ―MARSA‖ in the remarks section of the flight plan (i.e. LION11 MARSA
         SPAD11). MARSA operations will be limited to a maximum of 8 aircraft.
             8.1.3.1.4.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) When               requesting   taxi
             instructions, advise tower of intentions to depart MARSA (i.e. GROUND
             LION11 MARSA SPAD11 TAXI WITH CLEARANCE AND ATIS
             CODE). Each flight lead will receive a discrete beacon code from clearance
             delivery. The last aircraft in the MARSA formation will squawk a subset of
             second flight lead.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                         51


          8.1.3.1.4.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Prior to exiting Special Use
          Airspace, the flight lead will advise ATC of intentions to apply MARSA and
          provide all call signs. On initial contact with Seymour Johnson Approach, advise
          ATC of MARSA condition and state intentions for recovery.
       8.1.3.1.5. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Flights separating after air
       refueling to accomplish different missions will file a separate flight plan for each
       aircraft/element. Flights flying VR routes prior to air refueling must file a DD-
       175/1801, with a detailed route of flight in order to avoid confusion with Washington
       Center.
       8.1.3.1.6. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Flights requesting Phelps MOA
       will annotate this in the remarks section of their DD-175/1801 or file the appropriate
       stereo flight plan.
     8.1.3.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) FLIGHT BRIEFINGS:
       8.1.3.2.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Flight briefings will be conducted
       IAW AFI 11-2F-15EV3 and will be completed in sufficient time to allow, as a
       minimum, 15 minutes prior to step for crew briefing, personal time, and life support.
       8.1.3.2.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) For surge operations, flight leads
       will brief a single primary mission (i.e. SAT, ACT, SA, SAN, AGM, etc.). Missions
       flown during the surge may include the primary mission or any of the suitable
       alternate missions listed in paragraph 8.1.3.3.
       8.1.3.2.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) All end of tour (EOT) flights will
       be pre-briefed to, and approved by the squadron Operations Officer.
     8.1.3.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) APPROVED                               ALTERNATE
     MISSIONS:
       8.1.3.3.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The Operations Supervisor (Ops
       Sup/Top 3) grants approval to fly missions as pre-planned single or three ships by
       signing the daily flying schedule with the single/three ship missions annotated.
       Fallout formation options will be briefed and, if fallout occurs before takeoff,
       coordinate with the Ops Sup. All A/A missions may be flown as intercept, BFM or
       AHC missions. ACT and ACM missions may be flown as ACM and BFM missions,
       respectively. Single ship surface attack missions will be conducted IAW AFI 11-214,
       Air Operations Rules and Procedures, with the following addition: SAT missions
       may fly intercepts or SA as a backup. SA and SAN missions may fly basic intercept
       missions as alternate profiles.
     8.1.3.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) LOCAL WEATHER PROCEDURES:
       8.1.3.4.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Airborne aircrew will inform the
       SOF of weather changes affecting local flying.
       8.1.3.4.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The SOF will designate one base
       as a "divert" base. The ―divert‖ is informational only and denotes a field with
       forecast weather and facilities capable of safely accepting F-15E’s; it does not affect
       recovery field fuels. This information will be passed through the command post to
       the flying squadrons. If the divert base is other than Cherry Point MCAS, the divert
52                AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


     base will be listed on ATIS. When local forecast weather requires an alternate
     airfield be designated, the SOF will designate an "alternate" base. The "alternate"
     base will always be listed on ATIS. In the event ATIS is out, aircrew will contact the
     SOF for alternate/divert/overhead pattern status.
        8.1.3.4.2.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) TACAN Out Recoveries:
        When the TACAN is out of service, making all instrument approaches ―Radar
        Required‖, an alternate will be declared for IFR purposes. If the field is VFR and
        the SOF determines that a VFR recovery is possible, ATIS will carry the
        following verbiage: ―4th Fighter Wing Alternate Cherry Point (or appropriate
        alternate). VFR recovery fuel authorized‖. Aircrew may then return with VFR
        fuel.
     8.1.3.4.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Lightning                  within    5    (LW5)
     Aircrew Actions.
        8.1.3.4.3.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The 26 OWS will issue a
        weather watch for the potential of lightning activity within 5NM of Seymour
        Johnson. Aircrews can expect this watch to begin 30 minutes before the
        forecaster expects lightning within 5NM, or when thunderstorms are expected to
        move or develop within 10NM of the base.
            8.1.3.4.3.1.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) When actual lightning
            is observed within 10NM of the base, base weather will issue a weather
            advisory.
            8.1.3.4.3.1.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) When actual lightning
            is observed within 5NM of the base, base weather will issue a weather
            warning. Maintenance personnel will not work on the flight line under these
            conditions except for ―MISSION ESSENTIAL‖ situations. Aircrew actions
            are predicated on the phase of the mission in which they are involved.
            Aircrew must keep in mind the associated risk to human life associated with
            aircraft de-arm/shutdown when actual lighting is within 5 nm of the base.
        8.1.3.4.3.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Aircrew Procedures are
        outlined in the 4 OG Aircrew Aid. In general, utilize the following procedures:
            8.1.3.4.3.2.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) In chocks prior to start:
            Evacuate the aircraft and seek shelter.
            8.1.3.4.3.2.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) In chocks after start:
            Shutdown, evacuate the aircraft and seek shelter.
            8.1.3.4.3.2.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Taxiing to Arming:
            Contact SOF for further guidance and expect to either continue taxiing, return
            to EOR (primary – follow ―Arming‖ guidance), or return to the parking ramp
            (secondary – follow ―Enroute to parking ramp‖ guidance).
            8.1.3.4.3.2.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Arming: You will not
            be armed. If already armed, contact SOF for guidance prior to takeoff. The
            SOF must get 4 OG/CC approval to launch aircraft with LW10. If armed and
            the SOF directs you to de-arm and taxi back to the chocks, the aircrew and
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                        53


              EOR crew will follow the procedures outlined under ―De-arming.‖ If not
              armed and the SOF directs you to taxi back to the chocks, aircrew will follow
              guidance under ―Enroute to the parking ramp.‖
              8.1.3.4.3.2.5. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) In-flight: Contact the
              SOF for further guidance. Recover with additional fuel. If aircraft are already
              RTB when LW5 is declared and fuel for holding is unavailable – do not delay
              the decision to depart for the primary divert or next suitable divert as
              conditions dictate. If fuel allows, aircraft shall hold until LW5 is lifted or
              aircraft reach divert fuel. Aircrew will consider distance from both the
              alternate and SJAFB when selecting a hold location. If LW5 has not been
              lifted and aircraft need to land at Seymour Johnson, SOF shall obtain 4
              OG/CC approval for the approach and landing. The SOF must get 4 OG/CC
              approval to land aircraft with LW10.
              8.1.3.4.3.2.6. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) De-arming:                Contact
              SOF upon reaching De-arm. The SOF will direct crews to either ―De-arm‖ or
              ―Hold in De-arm.‖ Leave the tail hook up. The 4 OG/CC and 4 MXG/CC
              will make the ORM decision for aircraft to be pinned, pinned and shutdown,
              or shutdown without pinning.
               8.1.3.4.3.2.6.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) If told to ―De-arm:‖
               De-arm crews will de-arm aircraft using visual signals (no comm cord). Do
               not lower the tail hook. Crews will then taxi back to the chocks and follow
               guidance in ―Enroute to parking ramp.‖ NOTE: If the De-arm Supervisor
               feels that, in his/her judgment, the lightning is a hazard/risk to the de-arm
               crew, the aircraft will not be de-armed and crews should follow the ―Hold in
               De-arm‖ procedures.
               8.1.3.4.3.2.6.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) If told to ―Hold in
               De-arm:‖ The 4 OG/CC or 4 MXG/CC (through the SOF or the De-arm
               Supervisor) feels the risk to human life is significant. Aircrew should
               remain in EOR with engines running until LW5 dissipates and it is safe to
               de-arm. Anytime aircraft status changes due to an emergency or upon
               reaching 1000 pounds total fuel, contact the SOF and extend the speed
               brake.
              8.1.3.4.3.2.7. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Enroute to the parking
              ramp: If the 4 OG/CC or 4 MXG/CC feels that the lightning is a hazard/risk
              to the crew chief, the aircraft will not be shut down until weather conditions
              improve. Expect to taxi into parking without a marshaller.
       8.1.3.4.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Fighter Index of Thermal Stress
       (FITS) condition will be declared by the SOF and notification will be made through
       the Command Post (CP). Aircrew will respond to the FITS condition IAW AFI 11-
       202V3 ACCSUP1 Attachment 4, and the 4 OG Aircrew Aid.
       8.1.3.4.5. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Civil Twilight will be IAW AFI
       11-202V3. Aircraft may use the overhead pattern during civil twilight at the SOF’s
       discretion.
54                  AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


     8.1.3.5. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) LIFE SUPPORT:
       8.1.3.5.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Hat/Pam MOA is considered
       overwater for the purposes of anti-exposure suit guidance. BT-9/11 are considered
       overland ranges for the purposes of anti-exposure suit guidance. 4 OSS/OSW will
       provide temperature, wind and wave data for the Warning areas and temperature data
       for Hat/Pam on the daily Mission Execution Forecast (MEF).
       8.1.3.5.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Aircrews may transit areas at
       medium altitude that are either closed due to winds and waves or require anti-
       exposure suits enroute to areas that are unrestricted. Transiting an area means no
       tactical maneuvering in that area, i.e. no ACBT engagements or threat reactions.
       Example: Over-flying coastal portions of W-122 that are below 60˚F water
       temperature to get to warmer areas that don't require anti-exposure suits.
       8.1.3.5.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Wear of the survival vest on
       peacetime sorties is at the discretion of individual aircrews.
     8.1.3.6. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) PREFLIGHT:
       8.1.3.6.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) At least one crewmember will
       check the flight line area in front of the aircraft up to the ramp taxi line for FOD prior
       to entering the cockpit.
       8.1.3.6.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The gun will be safed for air-to-air
       training sorties. Use of the ARMT OVERRIDE switch is not authorized.
       8.1.3.6.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) For training sorties, set seat radio
       beacon to AUTO.
     8.1.3.7. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) START:
       8.1.3.7.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Flight leads will inform the
       squadron of any flight changes (i.e., tail number, fallout, takeoff time, range time,
       etc.).
       8.1.3.7.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) A fire bottle will be positioned
       near the aircraft and manned anytime an engine start is attempted.
     8.1.3.8. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) IFF PROCEDURES:
       8.1.3.8.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Do not squawk or interrogate
       mode 4B prior to Zulu day changeover.
       8.1.3.8.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) When departing or arriving ―non-
       standard,‖ the last aircraft squawks the subset of the assigned Mode 3 (i.e. assigned
       Mode 3-4315, last aircraft squawk Mode 3-4300 and Mode C).
          8.1.3.8.2.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) When the lead aircraft is
          assigned a squawk beginning with 00, the last aircraft in the non-standard
          formation will squawk Mode 3-0300.
     8.1.3.9. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) TAXI/MARSHAL/ARMING
     PROCEDURES (Ref. SJAFBI 11-250):
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                         55


       8.1.3.9.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Inform Ground Control of any
       required controlled takeoff time. Tower personnel will coordinate to have the aircraft
       in position by the controlled takeoff time.
       8.1.3.9.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Maximum taxi speed in congested
       areas is 15 knots, and in non-congested areas is 25 knots. Congested areas are defined
       as the F-15E ramp, TA ramp, KC-135 ramp, and any other area where numerous men
       and equipment are operating in close proximity to aircraft. Remain vigilant for AGE
       and vehicles and if in doubt of wingtip clearance contact the SOF/OPS for equipment
       removal. Aircraft departing and entering shelters will remain on the yellow line and
       be marshaled by a crew chief, unless taxiing to park during LW5 procedures.
       8.1.3.9.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The lead aircraft will take the
       arming slot farthest from the runway with subsequent aircraft taking the remaining
       positions toward the runway. Provide sufficient space for aircraft to taxi in front of
       and behind arming flights. Subsequent flights are not required to save a slot for
       joining wingmen.
       8.1.3.9.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) If an engine is shut down for
       maintenance, place the ramp switch in emergency and ensure the engine master
       switch is off after the engine has been shutdown. Aircraft with an engine shut down
       in EOR will have a fire bottle and guard posted prior to restart.
       8.1.3.9.5. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) RWY 08 Arming Area Overflow
       Procedures:
          8.1.3.9.5.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) If the SOF or affected flight
          leads observe an overflow or back log of aircraft in the RWY 08 arming area,
          he/she can direct/utilize the alert apron to wait for redball completion, assuming
          that an alert aircraft is not present.
          8.1.3.9.5.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The SOF will contact AM
          Ops to determine the alert apron status, to include FOD swept status and if any
          special missions will be using the area.
          8.1.3.9.5.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The SOF will ascertain
          which flight(s) are working redballs. The SOF can then direct the Tower Watch
          Supervisor to have flight members of the affected redball flight taxi to the alert
          apron to hold. Before taxiing aircraft from arming to the alert apron, the SOF and
          ground control will ensure aircraft on taxiway Alpha are not a factor.
          8.1.3.9.5.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Flights relocating to the alert
          apron will not block the entrance. Flights will skip the 1st set of bubbles, usually
          full of AGE, and proceed to the 2nd and 3rd set. Aircraft will pull into the bubbles
          and turn around towards the exit point to minimize jet blast concerns.
          8.1.3.9.5.5. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Once the status of the redball
          aircraft is known, the flight will either depart or continue to wait for the GAB
          aircraft to spare out and restart. Flights departing should call in sequence and
          ensure that flight members in the alert apron can taxi up to the runway area.

     8.1.3.10. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) AFTER
     LANDING/DEARMING/AIRCRAFT PARKING:
         8.1.3.10.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Automatically monitor Ground
         Control frequency after turning off the runway. The lead aircraft will take the de-arm
         slot farthest from the runway with subsequent aircraft taking the remaining positions
         toward the runway. Do not hold slots open for wingmen to de-arm. Aircraft will
         normally exit the de-arm area toward the runway, keeping engine exhaust away from
         other aircraft and dearming crews. The aircraft may be turned away from the runway
         if no other aircraft are present and ground personnel are clear.
         8.1.3.10.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) During engine shutdown, the
         nose gear pin will be installed using the following procedures: The crew chief will
         signal for left engine shutdown, the left engine will be shut down by the aircrew, the
         nose gear pin will be installed by the crew chief, the crew chief will signal for the
         right engine shutdown and the right engine will then be shut down by the aircrew. If
         required for aircraft maintenance and coordinated with the crew chief, the right
         engine may be shut down first.
             8.1.3.10.2.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) This procedure will not be
             used by cross country/off station flights without trained Transient Alert personnel.
             If there is a question about the training/capability of the personnel recovering the
             aircraft, insert the nose gear pin once both motors are shut down.
         8.1.3.10.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) If hot pit refueling, engine
         shutdown will be accomplished in de-arm. Delay shutting down the left engine until
         signaled by the ground crew. Once hot pit refueling is complete, engine restart will
         be accomplished in either the hot pit restart area or the arming area.
         8.1.3.10.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Follow procedures in the -1
         Checklist and 4th Fighter Wing Exercise Aircrew Guide for combat turnarounds, hot
         pit refueling, or other exercise events. If it is unsafe to taxi into or out of the fuel pits
         due to darkness, low visibility, cluttered ramp, etc., hot pit refueling will not be
         conducted. Aircrew will not hot pit refuel with any fuel abnormality.
     8.1.3.11. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) RADIO PROCEDURES:
         8.1.3.11.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) VFR                             traffic        pattern
         communication procedures are in the 4 OG Aircrew Aid.
         8.1.3.11.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) HAVE QUICK II nets are
         assigned by wing scheduling on the daily flying schedule in PEX under ―HQ‖.
         Assignment of net 0.1 is net 300.125 and so forth. Nets 0.4 and 1.4 will not be
         scheduled due to interference with local area approach frequencies; however, they
         may be used as spare nets if all the others are in use. Net 1.2 conflicts with Beaufort
         approach and shouldn’t be used in W-177.

       8.1.4.2.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Runway 26 is preferred for live
       ordnance configured aircraft if the tail wind component does not exceed 15 knots.
       8.1.4.2.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Tower will issue a directive to
       hold for wake turbulence following a ―heavy‖ aircraft on initial takeoff roll, low
       approach, or touch and go. ATC cannot grant approval to waive wake turbulence
       delay for ―heavy‖ aircraft.
       8.1.4.2.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) 4 OG/CC approval is required for
       operations when Min Go exceeds Max Abort. Adjusted Max Abort for Cable
       Engagement (AMA) will be used only in this case.
       8.1.4.2.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) To reduce FOD potential,
       accomplish rolling take-offs to the maximum extent possible. Static and formation
       takeoffs will not be used unless required for currency/proficiency or syllabus training.
       On the initial call to tower, state ―formation takeoff‖ or ―static takeoff‖ as
       appropriate. Rolling takeoffs will be assumed.
     8.1.4.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) DEPARTURE:
       8.1.4.3.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) When requested, non-standard
       departures up to 2nm between aircraft are approved unless otherwise stated by tower.
       8.1.4.3.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) If necessary, request deletion of
       the 1000 ft hold down altitude with tower.
       8.1.4.3.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) For noise abatement purposes
       during Runway 08 operations do not turn out of traffic until past Highway 70. Cross
       Highway 70 above 1000 feet MSL.

       restrictions are in the 4 OG Aircrew Aid. Airspace denials and conflicts will be
       reported through squadron Ops Sup to wing scheduling (722-2129).
       8.1.4.4.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) FENCE/Trigger Checks: When
       performing FENCE and Trigger checks, aircrew will:
          8.1.4.4.2.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) For overwater airspace, wait
          until established ―feet wet‖ before initiating FENCE/Trigger checks.
          8.1.4.4.2.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) For overland areas and
          MOAs, ensure aircraft are over an unpopulated area prior to initiating
          FENCE/Trigger checks.
       8.1.4.4.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Supersonic: All supersonic flights
       will be conducted in authorized airspace. In the warning areas supersonic is allowed
       above 10,000 feet and at least 15nm from the shoreline. Any unplanned supersonic
       flight that occurs in unauthorized airspace will be documented as required by AFI 13-

     8.1.4.4.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Echo MOA (REF. SJAFBI 11-
     250):
        8.1.4.4.4.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) For Runway 08 departures,
        make a north turn out of traffic to enter the MOA, unless directed otherwise by
        ATC.
        8.1.4.4.4.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) If the ECHO MOA is needed
        for PVUs or similar events only, request the MOA from 7,000 to 10,000’ MSL.
        Unscheduled requests for ECHO MOA operations above 10,000’ should
        anticipate at least a 15 minute delay due to coordination with Washington Center.
        Calling the SOF or RAPCON (through the Ops Sup) to facilitate coordination
        with Center may minimize the delays associated with unscheduled requests.
     8.1.4.4.5. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) W-122: Aircraft operating in W-
     122 will contact Giant Killer before entering and exiting.
        8.1.4.4.5.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Per
        FACSFACVACAPESINST 3120.1J, use a 29.92 altimeter setting when
        conducting operations above 5,000 AGL. Use local altimeter, assigned by Giant
        Killer, when training will include operations below 5,000 AGL.
        8.1.4.4.5.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Maintain VMC to maximum
        extent possible. Radar monitoring is required when IMC unless the flight lead
        coordinates for exclusive use of that airspace. Giant Killer's hours of operation are
        0700L to 2300L Monday through Friday, and as pre-coordinated on Saturday. All
        other times of operation will be by NOTAM. Monitor/use the Giant Killer
        common area frequencies: Areas 1-7, 310.1; Areas 8-14, 382.1; Areas 15-22,
        337.225; unless assigned a GCI frequency.
        8.1.4.4.5.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Before using flares at night,
        have the Ops Sup pass the location, time of flare use, and SOF phone number
        (722-4176) to the Coast Guard Rescue Coordination Centers (DSN 564-
        3700/Commercial 757-398-6231) and VACAPES (DSN 434-1320/1230).
        Additionally, Ops Sups will inform the SOF the intent to dispense flares at night.
     8.1.4.4.6. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) PHELSP MOA: Phelps MOA use
     will comply with guidance found in the 4 OG Aircrew Aid and the current Letter of
     Agreement with Washington Center. Flight leads will work with squadron and OSS
     scheduling to ensure they are scheduled for Phelps MOA in addition to being
     scheduled for Air Force Dare (AFD). The Phelps MOA can only be scheduled in
     conjunction with AFD range time.
        8.1.4.4.6.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) If not filed on a stereo flight
        plan, ―Phelps MOA‖ and a delay time must be listed in the remarks section of the
        DD Form 175/1801.
        8.1.4.4.6.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Do not schedule Phelps
        MOA unless you plan on utilizing the airspace. If Phelps MOA will be used, the
        flight lead will be required to check in with Washington Center on local channel 7
        to activate the MOA in addition to checking in with the Range Control Officer
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                          59


          (RCO). Flights electing to hold while awaiting ATC clearance to use the MOA
          can hold inside the MOA using appropriate VFR altitudes and airspeeds.
          8.1.4.4.6.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Once the MOA is activated,
          monitor the appropriate range frequency while on the range. With the MOA
          activated, the flight can maneuver in both R-5314 and Phelps MOA airspace.
          8.1.4.4.6.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Prior to leaving the MOA,
          whether VFR or IFR, notify Washington Center to close the MOA either on
          channel 7 or by confirming through the RCO.
     8.1.4.5. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) LOCAL AREA HAZARDS:
       8.1.4.5.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) KINSTON: Kinston is a class D
       airspace and aircrew will avoid this area by 5 statute miles and 2600’ MSL. Aircraft
       will not operate in this area unless specifically authorized by the controlling agency
       or under RAPCON control.
       8.1.4.5.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Hyde airport at (approximately
       8nm southwest of the AF Dare County Range complex) poses a midair collision
       potential for aircraft at low altitude on AF Dare and VR-084. Use caution to remain
       within the confines of R-5314 while using AF Dare and pay particular attention to
       clear for VFR traffic in the radar/pattern. Use caution for traffic from Edenton airport
       when entering R-5314 from the northwest.

          8.1.4.9.5.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The radar pattern will be
          flown at 250 KCAS.
       8.1.4.9.6. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Radar Trail Recovery Procedures:
       The following procedures are applicable to radar trail recoveries flown at Seymour
       Johnson AFB only.
          8.1.4.9.6.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) These                        procedures
          supplement AFI 11-2F-15EV3 Chapter 4 and SJAFBI 11-250. Flights recovering
          radar trail are a single formation for ATC purposes and will stay in formation
          unless specified.
          8.1.4.9.6.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Spacing                     between       each
          aircraft will be 1.5 to 2.5 NM. Desired spacing is 2.0 NM.
          8.1.4.9.6.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Intermediate                   aircraft   will
          maintain altitudes between the lead and trail aircraft.
          8.1.4.9.6.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Trail recovery profiles are
          (in order of preference): Instrument Approach Procedure flown established in
          trail, vectors to final established in trail, or the preceding procedures flown and a
          spacing maneuver executed. Do not utilize S-turning on final to gain spacing
          behind the lead aircraft. Spacing will be achieved utilizing briefed airspeeds and
          ranges from the field to ensure all aircraft are established and stabilized in the
          formation to safely recover the aircraft. At anytime if the spacing is in question,
          the wingman will either 1) on IFR approach, execute the missed approach
          procedure or 2) if VFR, break out of the pattern IAW local procedures to ensure
          spacing and notify the ATC controller.
          8.1.4.9.6.5. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) RADAR VECTORS:                             If
          spacing was not established prior to the enroute descent, flight leads should direct
          drag maneuvers for each flight member in sufficient time to ensure required
          spacing is obtained prior to turning final. (NOTE: ATC must be advised prior to
          commencing radar trail (drag) or any nonstandard formation).
          8.1.4.9.6.6. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) BREAKOUT/GO-
          AROUND/CLOSED/UNSAFE RUNWAY: Aircrews on a radar trail recovery
          instructed to breakout, go around, or when denied landing clearance will maintain
          2nm radar trail while executing the ATC directed maneuver. Once the ATC
          directed maneuver is complete the flight lead, if desired, may request individual
          control for flight split-ups otherwise ATC will control the radar trail formation as
          a flight.
          8.1.4.9.6.7. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) LOST                             CONTACT:
          Procedures are IAW AFI 11-2F-15EV3 Chapter 4.
       8.1.4.9.7. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) All aircraft should avoid flying
       over the base housing area, alert apron, and the munitions storage area, unless
       directed by ATC.

       8.1.4.9.9. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Touch and go landings at SJAFB
       as well as other locations should be limited to the minimum number required for
       mission accomplishment.
     8.1.4.10. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) FUEL REQUIREMENTS & BINGO
     FUELS:
       8.1.4.10.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Bingo fuels given in the 4 OG
       Aircrew Aid are suggested bingos and are to be used as a guide only. Flight leads are
       responsible for adjusting bingo fuel based on weather, alternate, location in airspace,
       suitability of diverts, wingman WX category, etc.
          8.1.4.10.1.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Aircrew                       will    declare
          ―Emergency Fuel‖ when they will land with less than 1200 pounds. NOTE:
          Declaring ―Minimum Fuel‖ tells ATC that the aircraft cannot accept any ―undue
          delay‖, but may not result in receiving traffic priority. If fuel is such that traffic
          priority is required, declare ―Emergency Fuel.‖
          8.1.4.10.1.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Add 1,000 pounds to bingo
          fuel during night VFR operations.
     8.1.4.11. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) DIVERT INSTRUCTIONS:
       8.1.4.11.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Aircrew will consider distance to
       alternate/divert base, as well as SJAFB when choosing hold location if awaiting
       airfield/runway opening for cable engagement/birds/etc.
     8.1.4.12. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) AIRCRAFT                        FATIGUE          AND
     OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT (ORM):
       8.1.4.12.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) To mitigate unnecessary fatigue
       on aircraft, Seymour Johnson aircrew will:
          8.1.4.12.1.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Limit maneuvering during
          administrative portions (enroute, CAP, overhead patterns, etc) of flight to
          moderate Gs (<4Gs). In general, limit administrative maneuvering to 2Gs and 22
          AOA.
          8.1.4.12.1.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Minimize high G, low
          altitude events such as pop patterns and closed patterns to RAP, proficiency, or
          upgrade training requirements.
          8.1.4.12.1.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Sound tactics and flight
          safety will never be sacrificed for this precautionary measure.
       8.1.4.12.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Aircrew will accomplish an
       ORM assessment for every sortie, utilizing 4 OG standard ORM worksheets. Flight
       leads will ensure worksheets are completed for their flight and Ops Sups will review
       prior to step.
     8.1.4.13. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) NATIONAL                                 AIRBORNE

       8.1.4.13.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) NAOC aircraft will stage out of
       the NAOC alert facility.
       8.1.4.13.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) In the event of a NAOC launch,
       ground control, Lion SOF and the tower will be directive to taxiing aircraft. All
       aircrews in the hammerhead for Runway 08 (arming/dearming) will signal the crew
       chief to halt arm/dearm procedures and will taxi clear of the arming area in a safe and
       expeditious manner, and hold on Taxiway A. NAOC aircraft have priority over all
       aircraft, to include those holding short for takeoff on Runway 08. If the tailwind
       component forces a Runway 26 departure, the NAOC aircraft will back taxi down the
       runway.
       8.1.4.13.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Once the E-4 has launched,
       aircraft will return to the arming area via the parallel.
       8.1.4.13.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Any aircraft holding for hot
       brakes will pull up as far as possible into the hot brake area and follow the standard
       hot brake procedures.

        Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) or Canadian into-plane contract
        (identified in FLIP, or list available at AM Ops).
     8.1.4.14.1.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Every attempt should be
     made to select airfields such that every other airfield of intended landing is an F-
     15 assigned base. This is to facilitate on-site corrective action in the event of
     unexpected F-15 specific maintenance issues.
     8.1.4.14.1.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Aircrews will not RON at
     bases where transient alert does not provide preflight/basic post flight inspections.
     Through flight inspections are not required at intermediate stops provided: no
     major maintenance is required, only normal servicing of fluids, air, etc., is
     accomplished and the same aircrew flies the aircraft or briefs the oncoming
     aircrew face to face.
     8.1.4.14.1.5. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Aircraft                   transiting   other
     bases will have the intakes inspected IAW 4 OG Aircrew Aid.
     8.1.4.14.1.6. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) All sorties not landing at or
     departing from Seymour Johnson AFB will be IAW ACCI 11-261, Cross-Country
     Flight Operations, the 4 OG Off-station Sortie Policy Letter (on 4 OSS/OSOS
     webpage), and 4 OG Aircrew Aid procedures. SQ/CCs will ensure appropriate
     approval has been granted for the requested events. Aircrew qualifications will be
     entered on the SJAFB Form 7.
     8.1.4.14.1.7. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Squadron Ops Sups will
     ensure cross-country aircrew have reviewed all aspects of weather, maintenance,
     crew rest, mission events, and airfield restrictions prior to departing on off-station
     flights.
     8.1.4.14.1.8. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Cross-country flights will
     normally be planned and flown with a minimum of two aircraft. Cross-countries
     scheduled as single ships will be contingent upon mission requirements, aircrew
     qualifications, and 4 OG/CC approval.
     8.1.4.14.1.9. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Single-ship low levels are
     authorized IAW AFI 11-214.
     8.1.4.14.1.10. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Prior to takeoff, ensure
     DD Form 2026, Oil Analysis Request, with the reverse side (Transient Oil
     Analysis Record) is completed and inserted into the aircraft forms.
     8.1.4.14.1.11. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) AFI                    23-202,    Buying
     Petroleum Products, and Other Supplies and Services Off-Station, normally
     requires all Air Force aircraft to refuel at military installations. In this case,
     present the Jet Fuel Identaplate, DD Form 1896 (AIRCARD), collect the receipt
     (DD Form 1898), and ensure documentation reflects the actual amount of fuel
     received. If the vendor insists on completing an invoice, write on the invoice -
     ―DUPLICATE-DD FORM 1898 ACCOMPLISHED‖. Record the fuel on AF
     Form 664 and attach the receipt. When refueling at a Canadian location, furnish
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                         67


          data from the AF Form 315 (in the forms) for vendor’s invoice, but do not use AF
          Form 315. Pay with AIRCARD, collect receipt, enter refueling information into
          the AF Form 664 and attach receipt. When mission requirements require refueling
          at other than military installations, fuel must be obtained from INTO-PLANE
          contracts, foreign government air forces, or commercial suppliers, in that order.
          Aircraft commanders and/or crew members will obtain complete and legible
          customer copies of all non-Air Force issue of fuel documents and return these
          documents to their home station. Appropriate forms will be completed during
          maintenance debrief. When 4 FW aircraft are refueled at non-Air Force
          installations, the aircrew will obtain the customer copy of the non-Air Force
          refueling document, and place it in the fuel receipt envelope in the AFTO Form
          781, AFORMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. Aircrews will ensure that
          the 781H, block 13, is signed-off and the refueling location annotated. Aircraft
          commanders are responsible for ensuring that INTO-PLANE contract fuel is used
          before NON-INTO PLANE contract fuel. The IFR/VFR supplements identify all
          airfields with INTO-PLANE contractors. The legend under "FUEL" states: fuel
          available through military base supply, INTO-PLANE contract and/or reciprocal
          agreement is listed first. Military fuel entry is followed by (MIL). Where contract
          fuel is available, the name of the refueling agent is shown. Aircrew will use
          (based on availability) military fuel, INTO-PLANE fuel, and NON-INTO PLANE
          fuel in that order.
          8.1.4.14.1.12. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) When                      traveling    off-
          station, all 4 OG aircrew will coordinate with local Base Operations to meet all
          security requirements, to include parking of the aircraft as well as storage of any
          classified material, IAW SJAFB FW OI 31-1.
          8.1.4.14.1.13. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) All aircrews are expected
          to read AFI 11-209, Air Force Aerial Events (F-15E DEMO Team will also read
          AFI 11-246V1, Air Force Aircraft Demonstrations (A-10, F-15, F-16)) when
          involved in an air show or static display at a civilian airfield.
       8.1.4.14.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) RETREAT CEREMONY FLY
       OVER PROCEDURES:
          8.1.4.14.2.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The OG/CC will identify
          which squadron will perform a retreat fly over when required. Wing Scheduling
          will ensure any MAJCOM approval for flyovers is completed. The FS/DO will
          designate the specific flight to perform the fly over as part of its departure to or
          RTB from the working areas.
          8.1.4.14.2.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Flight leads will plan on
          flying over the flagpole (N3521.49/W07757.75) at exactly 16:30:30L. The music
          for retreat will begin at 1630L and the F-15Es are to fly over during the music.
          Coordinate with the SOF on taxi out to confirm a fly over will take place.
          Minimum weather is 2500/5. Fly an extended initial to the active runway and at 5-
          10nm out, lean slightly north to fly over the flagpole. Approaching the field
          boundary descend to 1000' AGL/300C in close formation and after the fly over
          approaching the far field boundary climb out for a re-entry or the recovery
68              AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


       coordinated with approach. Exercise caution for other civil/military VFR traffic
       and towers NW of town.
       8.1.4.14.2.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The SOF is the ground
       liaison for the fly over and should confirm with the security police (722-1201)
       and the honor guard (722-7019) that a retreat ceremony will take place. Let the
       above agencies and the 4 FW/CCP (Wing Protocol) (722-0013) know ASAP if
       the fly over flight will not make it (troop formation will be in place at the flag
       pole waiting for the fly over of fighters to start the music for ―retreat‖). The SOF
       will ensure a game plan is in place to handle recoveries and allow the fly over to
       take place smoothly. All changes and cancellations regarding the fly over should
       be passed to Lion SOF (722-4176).
       8.1.4.14.2.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) In the event the desired
       run-in heading is non-standard, Wing scheduling will inform Lion SOF and Base
       Operations of the change in run-in. Base Operations will issue a NOTAM closing
       Seymour Johnson Class D airspace for 10 minutes on either side of the ceremony.
       Lion SOF will work with the Tower Supervisor and RAPCON to clear local
       airspace to facilitate the desired run-in. Flights will contact SOF for the fly over
       game plan. Additionally, flights will remain within 5 NM of GSB or in the normal
       VFR pattern to minimize traffic conflicts; descent to 1000’ should occur once
       inside the boundaries of Seymour Johnson AFB. If run-in is from the north, give
       particular attention to noise abatement over the town of , towers NW of the field,
       and traffic into and out of Goldsboro Wayne airport. If run-in is from the south,
       avoid over flying . In any case, begin a climb to pattern or assigned altitude
       following over flight of the flagpole and prior to 2 DME, and turn to re-enter or
       recover with approach.

     PRACTICE PROCEDURES
       8.1.4.14.3.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Refer to the 4 OG Aircrew
       Aid, F-15E DEMO Practice Procedures. The F-15E DEMO Team normally
       schedules two 1 hour practice sessions on a practice day. These blocks will be de-
       conflicted to the maximum extent possible from wing flying. The first block will
       normally begin 60 minutes prior to the Wing’s first T/O. The second block, if
       needed, will likely be during the normal fly window. The DEMO aircraft will
       strive to takeoff at the beginning of the window. The practice routine lasts
       approximately 15 minutes. The following procedures apply:
          8.1.4.14.3.1.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Base Operations will
          issue a NOTAM for the closure of Seymour Johnson AFB during the 1 hour
          demo practice window. This NOTAM will be issued 48 hours in advance.
          8.1.4.14.3.1.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) All 4 OG aircraft are
          allowed to start engines, taxi, arm, takeoff, recover, de-arm, and taxi to park
          during this 1 hour block as long as the DEMO aircraft is not airborne. While
          the DEMO is airborne, 4 OG aircraft are allowed to start engines, arm and de-
          arm. All aircrew should keep situational awareness on the DEMO aircraft.
          The DEMO aircraft will arm in the ramp area, taxi to the active runway and
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                       69


            execute an immediate takeoff. ATC requires a 5 minute buffer between the
            last aircraft departure and the DEMO aircraft. Emergency aircraft will take
            priority for landing. Flight leads must plan fuel accordingly for the DEMO
            slot to avoid diverting and/or an emergency fuel situation. Once airborne, the
            DEMO profile will take approximately 15 minutes. Once the profile is
            complete and the DEMO aircraft is in the pitch-up for land, the
            airfield/airspace will reopen for departures and recoveries.
            8.1.4.14.3.1.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The SOF will be the
            primary link between the DEMO aircraft and the rest of the 4 OG aircraft, AM
            Ops, and Command Post.
              8.1.4.14.3.1.3.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) T/O – 40 minutes:
              The DEMO captain will call the SOF 40 minutes prior to T/O. The SOF
              will inform the Tower Supervisor of the DEMO step and 40 prior to T/O.
              8.1.4.14.3.1.3.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The SOF will call
              AM Ops and Command Post to give a 40 minute prior to T/O call.
              8.1.4.14.3.1.3.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) AM Ops will call
              POL, CE (mowers), and MOC. AM Ops will then take a vehicle to sweep
              the aerobatics container.
              8.1.4.14.3.1.3.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) T/O – 25 minutes:
              DEMO aircraft will start engines. DEMO will call the SOF with any issues
              causing a delay.
              8.1.4.14.3.1.3.5. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) T/O – 15 minutes:
              will make a call on Guard for airspace/runway closure in 15 minutes. If
              flight leads have any questions they should contact the SOF. This will allow
              flight leads to form a plan of action. If the DEMO is delayed, those flights
              ready to taxi should consider doing so. Flights ready to T/O should depart.
              Flights on RTB, in conjunction with the SOF, should decide whether they
              will need to hold or if enough time exists to safely recover to SJAFB.
              8.1.4.14.3.1.3.6. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) T/O – 10 minutes:
              The DEMO aircraft will taxi. The SOF will call Command Post and give a
              10 minutes prior to T/O call. Command Post will disseminate this
              information to MOC and other base agencies and remove all personnel from
              the aerobatics container. Security Forces will close the perimeter road to all
              traffic. At 5 minutes prior to T/O the last 4 OG aircraft must depart in order
              to ensure de-confliction from the 5nm ring.
              8.1.4.14.3.1.3.7. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The                       DEMO
              aircraft will normally taxi directly to the active runway.
              8.1.4.14.3.1.3.8. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) If          the   active
              runway is 08, the DEMO aircraft will T/O from RWY 26 if the RWY 26
              tailwind is less than 20 knots.
              8.1.4.14.3.1.3.9. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) T/O – 1 minute:
              will make a call on Guard that runway operations are suspended. Once the
70            AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


          DEMO aircraft takes off, nothing is allowed inside the aerobatic container.
          Aircraft outside this area are allowed to start engines, perform normal
          ground checks, and refuel if in the hot-pit area.
          8.1.4.14.3.1.3.10. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Once the profile
          is complete, will make a call on guard that runway operations are resumed.
          In addition, the SOF will call AM Ops and Command Post to disseminate
          this information.
     8.1.4.14.3.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The waivered airspace is a
     5nm radius ring around the GSB TACAN up to 15,000’. The aerobatic container
     is a 6000’ x 3000’ rectangular airspace that is required to remain sterile with
     regard to ground operations and flying operations during DEMO flying. The
     waivered airspace is required to remain sterile from flying operations during
     DEMO flying. Aircraft in the Echo MOA must remain outside 10nm from the
     GSB TACAN.
     8.1.4.14.3.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) If the DEMO team does not
     use the first 1 hour block, then the Team will notify the SOF. The SOF will call
     AM Ops and Command Post who will relay this information to the Ops Sups.
     This information will be available at step time and also on ATIS. If both blocks
     are cancelled, the SOF will inform the Command Post, AM Ops, and the Tower
     Supervisor.
     8.1.4.14.3.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) If the DEMO practice will
     affect RTB operations, the SOF will dictate all flights carry 2000 pounds extra gas
     above VFR or IFR Aircrew Aid Bingo fuel. If requires an alternate, the DEMO
     Team can still perform the low/flat show option. This information will be
     available at step time and also on ATIS.
     8.1.4.14.3.5. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Emergencies will have
     priority for landing. If the emergency aircraft needs to recover while the DEMO
     is airborne and practicing, expect to call the DEMO aircraft and the profile will
     be terminated. The aircraft chasing the will clear off to hold at LaGrange/Mt.
     Olive after chasing the to land. After the lands, if the DEMO aircraft has enough
     fuel it will continue to practice. If the DEMO aircraft is low on fuel it will full
     stop when runway operations are resumed. Tower will notify aircraft that the
     DEMO is terminated and to expect to recover when runway operations are
     resumed.
     8.1.4.14.3.6. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) If aircraft recovering to
     Seymour during a practice DO NOT have enough fuel to hold and then land with
     normal recovery fuel, these aircraft will notify the SOF immediately. The SOF
     will then notify the Tower Supervisor to contact the DEMO aircraft and terminate
     the practice profile. Once the flight of interest has landed, the DEMO will
     continue or land based on fuel. Ops Sups will report to the SOF the reasons why
     the flight did not have sufficient fuel to hold during the DEMO profile.
     8.1.4.14.3.7. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Aircraft will attempt to
     hold at LaGrange/Mt. Olive (VFR) with altitude de-confliction or at
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                            71


            EEGEL/PHNTM (IFR). If VFR aircraft require holding at a higher altitude,
            coordinate with arrival or as necessary.

            8.1.5.3.5.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Deselect (unbox) any stores
            in A/G combat PACS programs. Ensure TRNG shows in the lower right corner of
            the HUD prior to pickling.
            8.1.5.3.5.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Select off-range targets so
            that an inadvertent release of expendable ordnance will not endanger life.
            Acceptable off-range targets while carrying unexpended BDU-33s include
            unoccupied bridges, roads, railroads or runways. Buildings are not acceptable off-
            range targets while carrying unexpended BDU-33s. If all A/G ordnance is
            expended and verified by the ranger (through receipt of bomb score for each
            weapon expended) or a battle damage check, off-range populated targets may be
            selected.
  8.1.6. Section F. Abnormal Procedures.
     8.1.6.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) IN-FLIGHT EMERGENCIES:
         8.1.6.1.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The decision to declare an
         emergency is based on aircrew judgment, experience and checklist guidance. Aircrew
         may delay declaring an emergency until initial contact with Seymour Approach
         providing they have contacted the SOF and the situation warrants delaying the
         declaration of an emergency. Make conservative decisions and remember there are no
         repercussions for declaring an emergency in any situation that requires early
         recovery.
         8.1.6.1.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) After declaring an emergency, the
         SOF will be contacted as soon as conditions permit. If not in the local area, any ACC
         SOF will provide assistance and can contact Seymour Johnson AFB for technical
         advice.
         8.1.6.1.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The Aircraft Commander is in
         charge of the emergency until the aircraft is stopped at the appropriate location,
         dictated by the nature of the emergency; i.e. straight ahead on the runway/taxiway,
         EOR, hot brake area, in the cable, etc. The Fire Chief or his designated representative
         will then take charge of the emergency until it is terminated. If recovery operations
         (ground handling) are required, the Crash Recovery supervisor (individual wearing an
         orange vest with white reflective stripes) will then be in charge of the ground
         operations.
            8.1.6.1.3.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) When clearing the runway,
            taxi into the EOR spot closest to the runway and await On-Scene Commander
            instructions. Follow marshaller guidance and expect that emergency responders
            will approach the jet when it is safe to do so. If contact with the On-Scene
            Commander is desired or required, contact him on channel 10.
         8.1.6.1.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) For a stores over-g (i.e., a SUU-20
         over-g) initiate a ―knock-it-off‖, perform a battle damage check and treat as if a
         ―severity code‖ 1, non-MIT over-g. If no abnormalities are observed, continue with

        mission. If some abnormal condition is observed, RTB (no emergency, chase ship
        required) to a straight-in full stop.
     8.1.6.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) SAR/RESCAP PROCEDURES:
        8.1.6.2.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Aircrews observing or assisting
        aircraft in distress should contact the controlling agency or any FAA facility on the
        agency's assigned frequency or guard if necessary and report the position of the
        downed crew. Assume on-scene command of rescue operations.
        8.1.6.2.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) When time and conditions permit,
        contact Lion SOF or Command Post. If outside the local flying area, contact the
        nearest ACC SOF. The SOF will notify the Command Post to initiate SAR actions.
        8.1.6.2.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) RESCAP aircrews should note
        any distinguishing geographic features that would expedite rescue operations.
        INS/EGI coordinates and/or TACAN bearing/DME are important for initial contact
        with rescue forces.
        8.1.6.2.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) RESCAP aircrews should attempt
        to establish and maintain communications with the downed aircrew (use Guard or
        282.8).
        8.1.6.2.5. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) RESCAP aircraft should conserve
        fuel to remain on station as long as possible or until relieved by another aircraft. Fuel
        must be monitored to ensure a safe landing at the primary recovery base or an
        alternate with standard fuel remaining.
        8.1.6.2.6. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Rescue facilities are located as
        follows: Elizabeth City (C-130, HH-60) - Thirty minute alert / Cherry Point MCAS
        (HH-46) - Thirty minute alert (5 minute alert during Cherry Point fighter flying
        hours) / All coast guard ships and other vessels within radio contact.
     8.1.6.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) LOST                                  COMM/NORDO
     PROCEDURES: (Ref. Flight Information Handbook)
        8.1.6.3.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Follow aircrew procedures IAW
        FLIP Flight Information Handbook.
        8.1.6.3.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) When RAPCON identifies a
        NORDO IFF squawk; they will attempt to transmit instructions on Ch. 10 and UHF
        Guard in addition to all common frequencies. If recovering NORDO in VMC, tower
        will attempt to transmit instructions on Channel 10 and UHF Guard in addition to all
        common frequencies.
     8.1.6.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) HUNG/UNSAFE                               ORDNANCE
     PROCEDURES: (Ref. 4 OG Aircrew Aid and SJAFBI 11-250)
        8.1.6.4.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Aircrews will advise the SOF
        when returning with hung ordnance.

     PROCEDURES:
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                           75


       8.1.6.5.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) External Tanks and Inert Stores:
       Stores jettison procedures and preferred areas are found in the 4 OG Aircrew Aid and
       SJAFBI 11-250.
       8.1.6.5.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Live                    Ordnance:      For   local
       missions, planners will coordinate for a jettison area when live-ordnance drops are
       planned. is the primary authorized area for the controlled jettison of live ordnance. If
       unable to use Fort Bragg, BT-9 may be used as an emergency back-up. The specific
       area and procedures will be briefed prior to live drop missions.
       8.1.6.5.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Jettison procedures will be briefed
       on all live/inert drop missions. The following procedures will be used and recorded
       when attempting to release hung or unexpended ordnance, (time and fuel permitting):
       another pass using normal release procedures; if CDIP was attempted, cycle to AUTO
       and try again; attempt release using RCP pickle button; Manual FF or Manual RET;
       Selective A/G Jettison.
     8.1.6.6. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) CHASE PROCEDURES:
       8.1.6.6.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Chase position is defined in
       Chapter 3. When practical, the chase aircraft will be positioned on the south side of
       the runway in a position to adequately observe the emergency aircraft and fly no
       lower than 300 feet AGL. IPs/SEFEs chasing overhead patterns will remain on the
       outside of the final turn and be positioned on the north side of the runway on final.
     8.1.6.7. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) HOT BRAKE PROCEDURES (Ref.
     SJAFBI 11-250):
       8.1.6.7.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Declare a ground emergency and
       notify the SOF for potential hot brakes anytime the aircrew, EOR crew, or crew chief
       suspect hot brakes. Fire Rescue are the only personnel who can chock the aircraft
       during a suspected hot brakes situation. Aircrew should initiate a ground emergency
       as soon as they suspect hot brakes to minimize the time that the wheel brakes are used
       while un-chocked.
       8.1.6.7.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Refer to the -1CL, suspend
       arming/dearming operations, remain clear of other aircraft, taxi to the closest hot
       brake area, position the aircraft into the wind, and await further instruction from the
       Fire Chief.
          8.1.6.7.2.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Aircrew will coordinate with
          the SOF for which hot brake area to use. Aircrew and the SOF should assess the
          situation taking into account current wind conditions, fire truck accessibility to the
          hot brake area, and turning room available in determining the proper direction to
          turn the aircraft.
       8.1.6.7.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) After the aircraft with potential
       hot brakes arrives and stops at the appropriate hot brake area, the Fire Chief will take
       control of the emergency. A Fire Rescue crew will approach the aircraft, chock it,
       determine if hot brakes are suspected, and if hot brakes are suspected assume
       surveillance position no closer than 300 feet away from the aircraft for thirty minutes
76                   AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010


       cooling time while they monitor the situation. Once thirty minutes has passed, they
       will allow crash recovery to approach the aircraft to see if the brakes have sufficiently
       cooled. If the brakes are cooled, the aircraft will be released to taxi. If the brakes are
       not cool, the fire chief will start an additional fifteen minute timer and the aircraft will
       not be released.
     8.1.6.8. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) MALFUNCTIONS                                     WHICH
     PROHIBIT TAXI:
       8.1.6.8.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) In addition to Chapter 7
       restrictions, aircrew will not taxi if they landed with unsafe gear indications (Safe =
       three down/locked with downside hydraulic pressure), or ordnance malfunctions that
       cannot be corrected in DEARM (Example: unsafe gun, hung ordnance that cannot be
       pinned).
     8.1.6.9. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) GUN                                    MALFUNCTION
     PROCEDURES:
       8.1.6.9.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Gun Malfunction procedures are
       listed in the 4 OG Aircrew Aid and SJAFBI 11-250.
     8.1.6.10. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) BARRIER CERTIFICATIONS:
       8.1.6.10.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Aircrews will be tasked to assist
       with periodic barrier certifications both at SJAFB and at other bases. Tasked aircrews
       will be MR or have an instructor in the jet. Contact the SOF before takeoff and after
       landing to coordinate the engagement.
       8.1.6.10.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Local                 barrier certifications.
       Contact barrier maintenance at 722-5132 prior to certification. Runway end lights,
       manhole covers, and FOD present hazards in the overrun.
           8.1.6.10.2.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Engagement will occur
           after landing with 2,000-10,000 lbs fuel remaining (40,000-50,000 lbs gross wt).
           Anticipate a 30-minute delay in EOR.
           8.1.6.10.2.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) When cleared by tower,
           taxi onto the runway and accomplish the -1CL steps for a cable engagement.
           8.1.6.10.2.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) When asked to certify the
           overrun cable, be particularly vigilant for FOD in the overrun. When cleared, taxi
           onto the overrun and execute a 180-degree turn to face down the runway. All
           overrun certifications will take place towards the runway.
           8.1.6.10.2.4. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Target speeds: BAK-12:
           40,000 lbs 75-95kts, 50,000 lbs 65-85kts.
       8.1.6.10.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Off-station barrier engagements.
       Contact the 4 OG/CC with details of barrier certification requirements and game plan
       prior to departure. Ensure inspection of the overrun (if required for taxi to
       certification) is accomplished. Aircrew must survey any lights, hatches or other
       possible obstructions on the runway/overrun. Ensure path to barrier engagement is
       clear of any possible hazards to the hook.

      CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH YIELD
                     EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) OPERATIONS

A2.1. General Information. Potential adversary use of CBRNE weapons against a friendly
airfield presents a serious threat to flying operations. Although the most effective way for
aircrews to avoid this threat is to be airborne before these weapons are detonated or dispersed
and then land at a field that has not been contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate
from a field that has come under CBRNE attack.
A2.2. Mission Preparation. Be aware of the status of the CBRNE environment at the planned
launch and recovery airfields, potential divert bases, and throughout the area in which the sortie
may fly. Know the current and forecast surface wind direction and on the MOPP level in effect
for relevant sectors of the airfield. Don appropriate aircrew chemical defense equipment
(ACDE) or Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) to match the appropriate MOPP level (reference
AFMAN 10-100) and carry individual protective equipment (IPE) as required.
A2.3. Stepping to Fly and Aircraft Preflight. This may entail donning ACDE or transitioning
from GCE to ACDE. Take precautions to protect aircrew from injury and or contamination
while in transit from the squadron facility to the aircraft. If possible, transport aircrew in a
vehicle that provides overhead cover (enclosed vehicle). If aircrew travel on foot is unavoidable,
choose a route that takes maximum advantage of available overhead cover (sun shades,
buildings, etc.) to avoid agents that may be settling from the air. If extra aircrew members are
available for preflight duties, consider assigning them to do so wearing GCE. This will allow the
aircrew actually flying to minimize exposure.
   A2.3.1. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) Prior to Engine Start. If Alarm Red occurs
   during the step or preflight process, take cover and don appropriate MOPP. This may require
   use of the ground crew mask. A hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) provides optimum
   protection, if available. Use caution if entering a HAS that contains aircraft or equipment.
   Close doors after entry. If a HAS or other overhead cover is not immediately available,
   accept the best rapidly reachable cover.
A2.4. Engine Start to Takeoff. If a HAS is available, use it to minimize exposure time by
accomplishing aircraft arming and EOR procedures inside the HAS (if local procedures permit)
and by delaying taxi time as long as possible prior to takeoff.
   A2.4.1. Aircraft Launch to Survive. Units will develop local procedures to provide this
   option to the commander. In general, aircraft may launch-to-survive any time after engine
   start if they have sufficient fuel and safe, expeditious access to a runway. This option may
   only be practical for aircraft that are near the end of runway (EOR) prior to takeoff or that
   have just landed.
   A2.4.2. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) Prior to Taxi. If in a HAS, the normal
   procedure is to shut down. Ensure ground personnel are aware of the alarm warning, as
   engine noise may preclude effectiveness of normal alert notification procedures. Use hand
   signals if necessary to be sure that ground personnel assume proper MOPP and close HAS
   doors. If not in a HAS, procedures may include launch to survive.
AFI11-2F-15EV3_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2010                                              85


   A2.4.3. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) After Taxi. Units typically establish
   procedures for this contingency depending on whether additional protection is available
   along the taxi route. For instance, if empty HAS are available, taxiing aircraft may be
   directed to shelter there. Ideally, ground crew sheltering in such a HAS would be available
   to assist in normal engine shutdown procedures and to close HAS doors. If protection is not
   available, the best option may be launch to survive. Maintain contact with Command and
   Control (C2) entities (Wing Operations Center, Maintenance Operations Center, Supervisor
   of Flying, etc.) to ensure unity of effort in the overall plan.
A2.5. Takeoff to Landing.
   A2.5.1. Contamination. If Chemical Warfare (CW) agent contamination occurs prior to
   takeoff, flying the aircraft will dissipate the agent to some degree. The greatest dissipation
   will occur during flights at lower altitudes and longer airborne times. Because the agent may
   have entered wheel wells, flaps, etc., consider flying in landing configuration to increase
   airflow to these areas. However, merely flying the aircraft is unlikely to achieve complete
   decontamination.
   A2.5.2. Preparing to Land. Aircrew should remain aware of the status of primary and
   alternate landing locations. Do not attempt to land during Alarm Red situations unless there
   is no other option. Follow C2 directions and either hold or divert. If mission needs prevent
   divert, hold until the Alarm Red (or theater equivalent) has cleared or become an Alarm
   Black. Prior to landing, gain awareness of contaminated sectors of the airfield and of
   current/forecast surface winds. Use this information in conjunction with C2 direction to plan
   a route from landing to engine shutdown. The liquid deposition phase following a CW
   airburst attack can extend up to 1 hour. If landing during Alarm Black, expect a
   contaminated environment and MOPP 4.
A2.6. Landing to Engine Shutdown. Take advantage of any protection available, minimizing
taxi time and distance. Maintain contact with C2 in order to remain aware of unexploded
ordnance and/or damage to airfield movement surfaces. If a HAS is available and local
procedures permit, accomplish aircraft de-arm and EOR procedures there. If Alarm Red (or
Theater Equivalent) occurs between landing and engine shutdown, considerations are similar to
those in para A2.4.
A2.7. After Engine Shutdown. Don appropriate MOPP. If circumstances permit, accomplish
normal post-flight inspection procedures. If the aircraft is not contaminated, close the canopy. If
there is any suspicion of personnel contamination, aircrew will process through an aircrew
contamination control area (ACCA). Accomplish maintenance debriefings under cover to the
maximum extent possible.
