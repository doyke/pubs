      1.2.4. Due to hanger obstruction east of the Assault Landing Zone, a significant portion of
      the assault strip is not visible from the tower. Due to reduced visibility, Maxwell Tower is
      unable to issue landing clearances to aircraft conducting Assault Landing Zone operations
      north or south. Operations will be at the pilot‘s own risk. Tower will continue to use
      appropriate separation and sequencing of all traffic.
Phraseology: ―(CALLSIGN), (POSITION REPORT) CHECK WHEELS DOWN, WIND 230 AT
7.”

      1.2.5. The Assault Landing Zone is usable for day and night operations during VMC
      conditions.
      1.2.6. Departures shall only be made to the South. Northbound Departures are not
      authorized due to a permanent obstruction (compost building). Landings are authorized in
      either direction.
      1.2.7. Aircraft landing in a Southerly direction are automatically authorized to roll through
      onto Rwy 15/33. Land and hold short operations are not authorized.
      1.2.8. Simultaneous Assault Landing Zone and Rwy 15/33 operations are not authorized.
      1.2.9. Transient aircraft conducting similar operations requesting use of the assault strip
      must coordinate through AMOPS, obtain a Prior Permission Request (PPR) number and
      review guidance in AP/1 prior to use. A one-time familiarization taxi on the assault strip is
      required for transient aircraft unfamiliar with Maxwell Assault Landing Zone Operations.
      1.2.10. During periods of heavy air traffic, the Tower may delay, limit or suspend Assault
      Landing Zone operations. Locally based C-130s have Assault Landing Zone priority over
      transient aircraft conducting similar operations. Assault Landing Zone operations are not
      authorized when Simulated Flame Outs (SFOs) are being conducted.
1.3. Runway Selection Procedures.
      1.3.1. The Maxwell Tower Watch Supervisor determines the active runway. The following
      procedures apply to the selection of or change to the active runway:
         1.3.1.1. Use the runway most nearly aligned with the wind when 5 knots or more or the
         ―Calm Wind‖ runway when less than 5 knots. Runway 15 is the ―Calm Wind‖ runway.
         Runway 33 is the preferred departure runway however, Runway 15 may be used.
         1.3.1.2. Tower coordinates with the following agencies before initiating a runway
         change:
             1.3.1.2.1. Montgomery Approach
             1.3.1.2.2. CE Help Desk 953-3333
         1.3.1.3. Tower notifies the following agencies when a runway change is completed:
             1.3.1.3.1. Montgomery Approach Control

1.4. Controlled Movement Area (CMA) (Attachment 2). Reference MAXWELLAFBI 13-
201, Airfield Driver Training and Vehicle Control, for further information.
     1.4.1. Maxwell AFB control tower controls all ground traffic in the radio controlled
     movement area which includes the runway, Assault Landing Zone, taxiways and overruns
     and all areas within 100 feet of the edge of the these areas. Vehicles in this area must be in
     two-way radio contact with the control tower or will have an escort with this capability for
     the entire time they are on the airfield. Personnel acting as escort must be certified to drive
     on the airfield and be fully aware of associated responsibilities. EXCEPTION: The portion
     of Taxiway Alpha from the North Ramp up to the hold line of the Assault Landing Zone is
     not part of the radio controlled movement area. However, personnel operating in this area
     must have a valid airfield driver‘s license.
     1.4.2. Pedestrians and non-radio equipped vehicles in the Controlled Movement Area must
     be accompanied by a radio equipped control vehicle or personnel. The control vehicle
     remains in contact with the tower to relay instructions and notifies tower when exiting the
     Controlled Movement Area.
NOTE: Before crossing the runway and Assault Landing Zone hold lines for any reason,
permission must be obtained from Maxwell control tower. When necessary, a radio may be
checked out from AM OPS dispatch section for temporary use or an escort may be used. When
communicating with the tower never use the word ―clear‖ or ―cleared‖ with any radio
transmissions.
     1.4.3. If radio contact is lost or suspected to be lost while operating on the movement area,
     the tower should be monitored for light gun signals. If radio contact is lost or suspected to be
     lost while operating on the runway, the tower should be monitored for light gun signals while
     the driver immediately exits the runway at the nearest exit. Repeated changes of intensity of
     runway lights indicate a need for tower to communicate with the driver by either radio or
     light gun signals. If radio failure is known or suspected, proceed to AM OPS and brief them
     on the incident. Airfield vehicles will display visual aid AFVA 11-240, USAF Airport Signs
     and Markings, for reference during vehicle operations on the airfield.
     1.4.4. Drivers will give way to taxiing or towed aircraft. Do not overtake and or pass a
     taxiing aircraft. The responsibility to avoid aircraft rests with vehicle operators. Vehicles
     encountering an aircraft coming from behind or in front within 100 feet will stop until the
     aircraft passes. If the aircraft has a large wingspan, the driver will quickly move out of the
     way of the aircraft and to every extent possible turn off the shoulder onto a hard surface.
     1.4.5. All agencies utilizing the taxiways and runway(s) when the Tower is closed/unmanned
     hours must contact 42 ABW/CP 953-7474/396.9 when entering and exiting the CMA.
     1.4.6. Bicycle traffic is limited to 908 AW (AFRC) maintenance and safety personnel.
     Under no circumstances are bicycles permitted on the Controlled Movement Area.
     1.4.7. Pedestrian traffic is limited to those persons whose official duties require their access
     to the airfield and to visitors escorted by an authorized official; prior coordination with AM
     is required.

       1.4.8.1. Reporting Procedures. Report all incidents or accidents involving aircraft or
       vehicles on the airfield immediately to AM (953-6961). Per AFMAN 91-223, Aviation
       Safety Investigations and Reports, report all Controlled Movement Area (CMA)
       violations on AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report, or AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic
       Report (HATR). If the violation resulted in the endangerment of the aircraft, report it as a
       HATR event using AF IMT 651. In the event of a HATR, AM will immediately notify
       42 ABW/SE—or the Command Post after hours—due to a requirement to report the
       event within 24 hours. The IMT shall be submitted to the 42 ABW/SE office for further
       action, investigation, and resolution. Security Forces shall forward a copy of all
       Controlled Movement Area (CMA) and Runway Intrusion Reports to AM (OSF/AOA)
       for action in accordance with above directives when the tower is closed.
       1.4.8.2. All vehicles operating on the controlled movement areas are subject to penalties
       as listed in MAXWELLAFBI 13-201 for failure to comply with the guidance contained
       therein.
   1.4.9. Vehicular Call Signs. All vehicles operating on the controlled movement areas will
   use authorized call signs as listed in MAXWELLAFBI 13-201.
1.5. Airfield Lighting System (Attachment 5).
   1.5.1. Runway 15/33. Both runways are equipped with High Intensity Runway Lights
   (HIRL), Threshold lights and Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) lights. Runway 15
   is equipped with High Intensity Approach Lighting System Category 1 configuration with
   Sequence Flashing lights (ALSF-1). The Assault Landing Zone is equipped with modified
   Airfield Marking Pattern1 (AMP-1) lighting plan. All taxiways are lighted except taxiway
   Bravo.
   1.5.2. Maxwell Tower is responsible for the operation of the airport lighting systems in
   accordance with procedures in FAA Order 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, and AFI 13-204v3,
   Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs, during normal airfield hours.
   1.5.3. Airfield Ramp Security Lighting Procedures: Prior to closing, Tower MUST turn the
   lights off and relinquish control of ramp lights to Security Forces (SFS). This will allow SFS
   to control the lights manually from the two electrical panels on West and North ramps.
   Procedures below:
       1.5.3.1. Tower ramp light switches must be OFF.
       1.5.3.2. SFS locate lighting panel.

1.6. Permanently Closed Portions of the Airfield. Permanently closed portions of the airfield
are displayed in MAXWELLAFBI 13-201. The closed portions of the airfield are marked with
yellow Xs.
1.7. Aircraft Arresting Systems (Attachment 4).
   1.7.1. Maxwell AFB aircraft engagement system is the Textile Modular Brake (MB-60).
   The MB-60 is UNI-DIRECTIONAL, located 35 feet into the overruns for RWY 15/33. It is
   a low profile system. Aircraft rollovers on the MB-60 will not cause damage to aircraft or
   aircraft braking systems. The MB-60 may be left in position at both ends of the runway but
   the energy absorbers must be disconnected from the engaging device(s) from the approach
   end cable and the cable properly secured to prevent movement from jet blast. The MB-60 is
   a one-time use system.
   1.7.2. Activation of the MB-60 arresting system is INITIATED BY AIRCRAFT
   ENGAGEMENT. TOWER HAS NO CONTROL. AM personnel will visually check the
   MB-60 cable and rubber donuts daily for damage. AM will also visually check the vinyl
   cover for tears and deterioration. Annotate discrepancies on the AM daily events log
   documenting the time CE was contacted. Notify CE Help Desk at 953-3333.
   1.7.3. Barrier Maintenance performs inspections of arresting systems once every 24-Hour
   period, normally by 0830L. Standby personnel will perform inspections on weekends and
   holidays. The MB-60 system does not require maintenance and has an equipment life of 10
   years. The MB-60 is not sensitive to the environment. Climatic conditions do not affect the
   braking efficiency of the system.
   1.7.4. Maxwell Tower notifies the C.E. Help Desk with barrier configuration change
   requests (953-3333). Runway changes are not dependent on barrier configuration;
   however, once the decision is made to change the runway in use a request to reconfigure the
   barriers will be initiated. Every attempt will be made to arrive and depart tail-hook equipped
   aircraft with the departure end cable – even if the operation involves opposite direction
   clearances.
1.8. Parking Plans/Restrictions (Attachment 6).
   1.8.1. There are three primary parking ramps on Maxwell AFB:
       1.8.1.1. West Ramp. This ramp is used primarily for 908th Airlift Wing (AFRC) C-
       130s. There are 11 marked parking spots. Limited additional space is available for
       transient aircraft.
          1.8.1.1.1. All C-130 aircraft parking in spots 1 through 9 on the West Ramp enter the

       departing IFR/VFR aircraft is established on a course diverging by at least 45 degrees
       from the reciprocal of the final approach course before an arriving IFR/VFR aircraft
       reaches 4 NM final.
NOTE: Tower issuance and observance of a VFR aircraft executing a crosswind turn to enter
the closed traffic pattern meets the requirements of having the VFR aircraft execute a course
divergence of at least 45 degrees prior to the opposing aircraft reaching 4 NM final.
   7.14.3. Arrival versus Arrival:
       7.14.3.1. Montgomery Approach shall ensure IFR/SVFR aircraft will not proceed closer
       than the final approach fix until the preceding opposite direction aircraft has crossed the
       landing threshold or commenced circle for a circling approach. Maxwell Tower shall
       ensure VFR aircraft, operating under its control, has crossed the landing threshold prior
       to IFR aircraft reaching the final approach fix.
   7.14.4. All aircraft utilizing the Assault Landing Zone shall operate the same direction.
   Opposite direction operations to the Assault Landing Zone, are not authorized.
7.15. Breakout/Go-Around/Missed Approach Procedures. Aircraft instructed to breakout of
traffic, or to go around shall comply with ATC instructions provided by the tower. Aircraft
instructed to go around during an IFR approach shall execute the missed approach instructions
published or issued by Montgomery Approach Control.
7.16. Civilian Aircraft Operations.
   7.16.1. Request by civil aircraft for practice approaches must be approved by Maxwell
   Tower on a non-interfering basis. Civil aircraft may only perform low-approaches.
   7.16.2. Civilian No Flight Plan Arrivals.
       7.16.2.1. When notified of an inbound aircraft planning to land/full stop without a flight
       plan on file with AM, Maxwell Tower immediately notifies AM.
       7.16.2.2. Unless the aircraft is experiencing an emergency, the aircraft is not permitted to
       land until the Tower is given approval by AM.
           7.16.2.2.1. If the aircraft is not experiencing an emergency and does not contact AM
           as instructed but lands anyway, the Tower activates the PCAS and instructs the
           aircraft to hold on either taxiway A or taxiway E.
           7.16.2.2.2. AM immediately activates the secondary crash phone and notifies the

7.18. Weather Dissemination and Coordination Procedures.
   7.18.1. The Maxwell Weather Station (OSF/AOW) provides full service. Hours of operation
   are the same as the airfield hours and are posted in the IFR Supplement. Services include
   aircrew briefings on a time available basis, surface weather observations (when airfield is
   open) and climatological briefings. After duty hours, support is provided by the 26 OWS at
   Barksdale AFB, LA, IAW Memorandum of Agreement between the 42 ABW and the 26
   OWS.
   7.18.2. The Maxwell Weather Station will disseminate hazardous/severe weather conditions
   via the Joint Environmental Toolkit. In the event of automation failures, weather will notify
   Maxwell Tower via landline of hazardous/severe weather.
7.19. Bird/Wildlife Control. Local flying units will report increased bird activity near the
airfield and promptly report hazardous conditions to AM personnel and or the Tower. Local
flying units must establish procedures for bird strike avoidance. AM personnel are the authority
to declare a bird watch condition (BWC) during normal flight operations. Local flying
restrictions during increased bird activity are defined in 42 ABW Plan 91-212, Bird Aircraft
Strike Hazard Plan.
7.20. Bird Watch Conditions (BWC).
   7.20.1. BWC Severe represents high bird population on or immediately above active
   runways or specific location that represents a high potential for a strike. Supervisors and
   aircrews must thoroughly evaluate mission need before conducting operations in areas under
   condition Severe.
   7.20.2. BWC Moderate is increased bird population in locations that represent an increased
   potential for strike. This condition requires increased vigilance by all agencies and
   supervisors and caution by aircrews.
   7.20.3. BWC Low is normal bird activity on and above the airfield with low probability of
   hazard. Aircrews are responsible for checking the BWC prior to flying. Absence of a BWC
   on ATIS means the BWC is LOW. Refer to 42 ABW Plan 91-212 for further guidance and
   procedures.
7.21. Airfield Photography.
   7.21.1. Requests to photograph aircraft on the airfield (controlled or restricted area) require
   approval from Public Affairs. Upon approval, Public Affairs shall notify AM and SFS of the
   location and time of the photo shoot.
   7.21.2. Violations of this policy are immediately reported to Security Forces by AM.
NOTE: Exceptions are at the request of AM, i.e. Wing/Base Safety in the performance of their
duties.
7.22. Tactical Arrival/Departure Procedures.
   7.22.1. Random Steep Approaches. Random steep approaches may be flown to the main
