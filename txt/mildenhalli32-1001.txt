This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-10, Installations and
Facilities, 4 March 2010, and establishes a 100 ARW Facilities Board (FB), and a Facilities
Board Working Group (FBWG). The FBWG combines the former Facilities Utilization
Working Group (FUWG), Real Estate Working Group (REWG), and Traffic Management
Working Group (TMWG) into a single FBWG. This instruction prescribes the responsibilities of
each of these groups and identifies their objectives, organization, and membership. It applies to
all organizational and partner units on Royal Air Force (RAF) Mildenhall. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.
Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to 100 CES/CEN, using the
AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route the AF Form 847 from the
field through the appropriate functional chain of command.

1. Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is to ensure efficient use of existing real property
facilities in support of the RAF Mildenhall mission together with the support units as prescribed
by host or tenant support agreements.
2. Facilities Board (FB). The FB directs the use of real property facilities and civil engineer
fiscal and physical resources in support of Team Mildenhall missions. The 100 CES manages

the FB/FBWG processes on behalf of the 100 ARW. The 100 ARW/CC has overall
responsibility for installation and facility management at RAF Mildenhall.
    2.1. Frequency. FB meetings will meet at least twice per year. Timing and agenda will be
    determined by 100 CES, after coordination with 100 ARW, and scheduled to support USAFE
    and HAF program submission timelines. Out-of-cycle meetings may be required in special
    circumstances and the use of an out-of-cycle eSSS may be used when necessary.
    2.2. Functions. The FB will review, approve or disapprove, and prioritize items included in
    the following areas as recommended by the FBWG:
       2.2.1. All demolition, minor construction (work less than $750,000) and repair of all real
       property. The FB will approve the Base Comprehensive Asset Management Plan
       (BCAMP) to include the supporting investment strategy (e.g. the Integrated Priority List
       – IPL). The IPL will cover a two year outlook period.
       2.2.2. Military Construction (MILCON) Program (major construction work over
       $750,000).
       2.2.3. Future programs from other funding sources to include MFH, NAF, AFSOC,
       TWCF, ISR, AAFES, DECA, and NATO.

       and supplemental Air Force guidance.
       2.2.5. All new facility sitings and proposed acquisition or disposal of facilities and real
       property. Once 100 ARW/CC approval is received 100 CES will work through the RAF
       Commander for subsequent coordination with the local council and/or county, as
       applicable.
       2.2.6. Installation Development Plan (IDP) review and revisions to ensure compatibility
       with current and future mission requirements. 100 CES shall ensure that the IDP remains
       a current and accurate reflection of Team Mildenhall’s mission priorities and long-range
       facility infrastructure development plans.
