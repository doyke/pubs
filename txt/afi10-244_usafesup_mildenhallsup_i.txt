                                           Chapter 1

            AIR AND SPACE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE (AEF) CONCEPTS

1.1. General. The AEF is the Air Force‟s methodology for organizing, training, equipping, and
sustaining rapidly responsive air and space forces to meet defense strategy requirements.
Through the AEF, the Air Force supports defense strategy requirements using a combination of
both permanently assigned and rotational (allocated) forces.
   1.1.1. How to use this AFI. This AFI governs Unit Type Code (UTC) status reporting. This
   instruction should be followed in the context of AFI 10-401 Air Force Operations Planning
   and Execution, which contains planning considerations for these UTCs and a full description
   of AEF concepts. Chapter 1 contains the basic description of the AEF and AEF UTC
   Reporting Tool (ART). Chapter 2 outlines roles and responsibilities in UTC reporting.
   Chapter 3 describes assessment and reporting policies.
1.2. Force Presentation. The Air Force aligns its war fighting capabilities into a baseline of 10
AEFs, each intended to contain an equivalent capability from which to provide forces. During
periods of increased requirements, capability areas from these 10 AEFs may be realigned within
the Global AEF construct to a Tempo Band that provides a deeper pool of capability, deploying
that capability at a more stringent deploy-to-dwell rate. The Air Force develops and tailors force
packages to meet mission requirements. Specifically tailored forces are presented to theater
commanders as Air and Space Expeditionary Task Forces (AETFs). Refer to Air Force Doctrine
Document (AFDD) 2 for doctrinal guidance on force presentation. The AEF will include
strategic “enabler” or common user assets, such as long-range mobility, Special Operations
Forces (SOF), and space forces, that will provide support to authorized organizations within and
outside of the Department of Defense (DOD), including Air Force movements of AEF forces.
Also postured as enablers, the Air Force‟s High Demand/Low Supply (HD/LS) assets (U2, E-8
JSTARS, E-3 AWACS, RC-135 RIVET JOINT, SOF, CSAR, etc.), will play critical roles in
AEF operations.
1.3. Spectrum of Operations. The National Military Strategy dictates that the Air Force be
prepared to support requirements across the spectrum of operations from humanitarian and
disaster relief operations up to and including major war (MW). The Air Force will meet its day-
to-day steady-state deployed operational commitments using the UTCs assigned to the two on-
call AEFs, one on-call AEW, and available enabler forces. Any substantial or sustained
commitment of forces beyond this level will constitute a surge for the Air Force, which will
require some degree of reconstitution of the involved forces after the surge ends.
1.4. Force Management. The AEF libraries contain a finite amount of capability that at any
given time identifies forces that constitute the total force that has been made available or
allocated for scheduling. The 10 AEFs are paired (e.g. AEF 1 and 2, AEF 3 and 4, etc.) into five
4-month contingency on-call/deployment eligibility period every 20 months. Most LS/HD assets,
as defined in GMFP, are not formally assigned to individual AEFs but are postured in the
Enabler library and will rotate as operational requirements dictate. Deployment levels must be
consistent with GMFP guidelines. Air refueling forces and medium-range airlift forces (currently
consisting of C-130 units) will be assigned to AEFs and enabler operations, subject to careful
scheduling to avoid over tasking.

1.5. Reporting AEF Status - General. To view the health of forces in the ten (10) designated
AEF's, AEWs, lead mobility wings and enablers, Air Force senior leadership determined a need
to collect UTC readiness status data from all AEF-allocated UTCs of sufficient detail to support
the following goals:
     1.5.1. Provide HQ USAF, AF Component Commanders, MAJCOM's, and AFPC/DPW
     readiness information to employ, manage, and sustain AEF operations.
     1.5.2. Provide units a mechanism to report a UTC‟s current and future (6 months out) ability
     or inability to fulfill its Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) across the full ROMO, to
     include contingency and rotational operations, and highlight associated deficiencies within
     the UTC.
     1.5.3. Provide information to aid resource allocation and tasking decisions during steady
     state and crisis actions.
1.6. System Description: The AEF UTC Status Reporting Tool (ART) is designed to support
the goals listed above. ART allows AEF-allocated units the ability to report UTC level readiness
data. It provides one central location to archive reported data. It allows immediate updates and
ready access to an aggregate UTC status for all levels of command with sufficient depth of
information to make informed decisions on the employment of forces for AEF operations. It
further provides a means for identifying and analyzing actionable indicators of change.
     1.6.1. ART is a web-based, non-intrusive, html-environment tool with associated databases
     to support collection, collation, and report generation of unit and aggregate UTC readiness
     data. It resides on the SIPRNET (https://aefcenter.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil/) for secure
     access. Units that are levied UTC taskings under AEF, view and report their status against
     these taskings directly within the ART application.
     1.6.2. ART's report generating capability allows all levels of command to arrange data to
     produce tailored written reports and graphics. The reports section is read-only and can be
     accessed by anyone with SIPRNET access.
     1.6.3. A       fully   functional    training      site    exists      on    the     NIPRNET
     (https://aefcenter.afpc.randolph.af.mil/). This site also allows personnel to review the ART
     tutorial and other guidance. There are no restrictions on this site; anyone can login and enter
     training data or experiment with the report section. DO NOT enter real world data on the
     training site.
     1.6.4. Operationally, ART supports the goals stated above by collecting and collating unit-
     reported data to answer, in whole or in part, the following associated questions:
        1.6.4.1. Are AEF allocated UTCs able to accomplish their MISCAP defined mission if
        tasked
        1.6.4.2. Are AEF allocated UTCs able to accomplish their component tasked mission?
        1.6.4.3. Do adequate resources exist and is training available in order to accomplish and
        sustain the AEF mission(s)?
     1.6.5. ART complements readiness data reported in Status of Resources and Training
     Systems (SORTS). ART focuses reporting on the modular scalable capability-based UTC‟s
     designed to meet the needs of the 21st century force while SORTS is unit-centric with
AFI10-244_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                7


  reporting based on major war (MW) commitments. The basis for both systems is the AEF
  Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) library (Once the UTC Availability Module
  (UTA) is available in DCAPES, it will be the basis.). The tasking baseline contained in ART
  is derived from the AEF Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) library which
  supports the range of military operations (ROMO). Readiness assessments for MW and AEF
  tasking must be considered together; however, the reporting guidelines for each may be
  independent. A unit‟s C level as reported in SORTS may not directly correlate to its ability to
  support a specific UTC tasking as indicated in ART.

                           ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. ART Reporting. Unit commander assessments reported in ART present the status of each
UTC in the AEF library; and they provide higher levels of command the necessary information
to make force and resource allocation decisions to effectively support theater commanders.
Within the AEF construct, the UTC assessments are used to determine the most effective force
tasking. Effective management of Air Force resources requires accurate information at all levels.
For these reasons integrity in reporting an accurate status is paramount. ART is not a report card,
but a method of identifying a UTCs ability to perform its MISCAP and identify shortages of
resources therefore, commanders must "tell it like it is."
2.2. Headquarters USAF.

     ensuring UTCs postured against the director‟s staff are assessed according to AFI 10-244
     and this supplement and perform those functions outlined below.
        2.7.6.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Designation letters must be provided to the HQ USAFE
        Readiness Measures (USAFE/A3JA)
     2.7.6.2. (Added-USAFE) The appropriate FAM will review, assess adequacy of
     remarks and reporting status of USAFE units, and contact the reporting unit to discuss
     plausible changes to ensure reporting consistency across the function within USAFE.
     FAMs cannot change or direct the change of a unit‟s remark or status, since the remarks
     are unit and wing assessed, validated, and certified.
     2.7.6.3. (Added-USAFE) The appropriate FAM will ensure the UTA is current and
     updated through the MAJCOM OPR (HQ USAFE/A3JA UTC Availability & MEFPAK
     Management) in a timely manner, ensuring UTC accuracy within the ART Program.
     Coordinate any UTA discrepancies with affected wing/unit.
     2.7.6.4. (Added-USAFE) The appropriate FAM will consider ART status during
     wing/unit requested personnel, equipment or training reclamas and waivers (e.g. a
     reclama or waiver should not be approved if the requesting wing/unit has not identified
     the specific shortfall through the ART program).

                                  REPORTING POLICIES

3.1. Classification. ART contains real world deployment and personnel data. It is incumbent on
all personnel to be aware of the classification of data entered in ART. A UTC assessments in
ART is classified confidential, aggregate unit UTC reports are classified secret IAW Executive
Order (EO) 12958. Do not enter data that is classified under other guidance such as "Special
Access Required" information.
3.2. ART Data Classification. Executive Order (EO) 12958, Classified National Security
Information, requires us to protect classified information while striking a balance between
protection and the need to inform the American public of their governmental activities.
Additionally, this EO increases and emphasizes personal responsibility for classification and
declassification decisions.
   3.2.1. Derivative Classification. Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing,
   restating, or generating in a new form information that is already classified, and marking the
   newly developed material consistent with the classification markings that apply on the source
   information.
       3.2.1.1. Derivative Classifier. Persons applying derivative classification markings must
       carry forward to any newly created document the classification markings from the
       original source or document.
       3.2.1.2. ART assessment data (i.e., color codes, missing resources detailed in remarks,
       and limiting factors) for a single UTC, is classified at a minimum CONFIDENTIAL.
       3.2.1.3. Aggregate ART assessments (two or more UTC assessments) are classified
       SECRET. ART data converted to a new type information must be evaluated for its impact
       on national security if released.
          3.2.1.3.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) When compiling sensitive material for ART
          reporting (i.e. email, spreadsheets, word documents, or any other electronic formats)
          ensure any other assessment data (i.e. Date Return Over Seas (DEROS), Deployment
          availability (DAV) codes, personnel/training/equipment limiting factors, etc) that may
          be compiled together to compromise UTCs deficiencies IS NOT MAINTAINED on
          Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPR) computers.
       3.2.1.4. Data classification. Raw resource data used to derive UTC assessments is
       classified IAW it‟s original source. When data is directly associated with an ART rating
       or used in an ART worksheet, the data becomes classified IAW this guidance.
       Preformatted worksheets should be clearly marked with instructions on classification.
       3.2.1.5. Classification Authority. As with SORTS, ART combines elements of the
       JOPES database with assessments of the ability of units to provide combat capability.
       The assessments are used in the Air Force war-planning effort as a readiness feed to the
       Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) which
       parallels SORTS and JOPES war-planning capability. The Joint Staff SORTS database is
       classified SECRET. Information extracted from this database is classified IAW, CJCSI
       3401.02 and must contain derivative classification markings consistent with EO 12958,
 26                          AFI10-244_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


       except where authorized otherwise. Derivative classification rules apply when extracts
       contain exempted data. ART will follow this same rule set and classification guidance.
       3.2.1.6. Classification Marking. ART data or extracts are classified by this AFI. Mark
       documents or data “DERIVED FROM: AFI 10-244 dated 12 Sep 05, Declassify on:
       (date).” The date of declassification is 4 years from the date of the document for each
       level of classification. Declassification timeline is 4 years for CONFIDENTIAL, 8 years
       for SECRET. See DOD 5200.1r, Information Security Program and CJCSM 3150.02
       Global Status of Resources and Training for additional classification guidance.
       3.2.1.7. Downgrading Authority. Initial downgrading of force readiness data and
       aggregate information will be determined by CJCS. HQ USAF/A3/5 is the authority to
       extend or accelerate downgrading classification of ART and SORTS data following an
       initial determination by CJCS.
       3.2.1.8. (Added-USAFE) Mark/stamp all paperwork IAW DoD 5200.1-R, Information
       Security Program, DoD 5200.1-PH, DoD Guide to Marking Classified Documents, and
       AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.
3.3. What to Report. Commanders will report the unit‟s current ability through the next six
months to support each allocated UTC. NOTE: ART uses an extract of the approved UTC/UIC
AEF assignment of forces in the UTC Availability. A-UTCs are not currently reported in ART.
ART is a source for AEF UTC/UIC alignment for the unit commander.
   3.3.1. Units reporting SORTS with UTCs allocated to an AEF or identified as an enabler
   shall continue to report SORTS IAW their Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statement
   and AFI 10-201, in addition to reporting in ART.
3.4. UTC Assessments. Assessments are based on all aspects of the UTC to include: (1) the
ability to perform the capability defined by the Mission Capability (MISCAP) Statement, (2) can
fulfill the standard manpower requirements, and (3) can fulfill the complete equipment
requirements.     The Logistic Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR) Logistics Detail
(LOGDET) and Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) of the Manpower and
Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK) will be used to maintain the manpower and
equipment requirements.
   3.4.1. Response Time. A UTC readiness assessment is based on resources that are expected
   to be mission ready and available within their DOC response time, (if the UTC is referenced
   in the unit‟s DOC statement), or within 72 hours of tasking or less depending on the UTC
   requirements. A UTC is eligible to be tasked to perform its mission at any time.
   3.4.2. The Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) provides a brief description of the
   capability for which the UTC is designed.
   3.4.3. The Logistic Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR) provides a list of equipment the
   UTC requires to perform the mission.
   3.4.4. The Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) contains the manpower detail
   required to provide the capability for a standard UTC.
   3.4.5. Commanders provide an assessment of UTC readiness based on the unit's ability to
   provide the UTC for mission execution at any time.
AFI10-244_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                             27


  3.4.6. Commanders are not constrained by the unit SORTS "C" rating when assessing the
  health of the UTC.
  3.4.7. Commanders rate each UTC against the unit's current ability to deploy and employ
  the UTC. Areas to be considered are personnel, equipment, training, and equipment
  condition. Personnel must be worldwide mobility qualified and have all required mission and
  skill level training complete IAW applicable directives and instructions. Equipment must be
  serviceable and available for deployment.
     3.4.7.1. Equipment and supplies on hand reporting includes the status of LOGFOR
     equipment and supplies required to support the UTC. It may indicate budget and supply
     problems when details are known. Commanders determine the readiness status based on
     the availability of mission required equipment and supplies. Items are considered
     available if they are assigned to the unit and are physically present at the unit for
     deployment.
         3.4.7.1.1. Units should report the status of UTCs as stand-alone requirements. For
         “rainbowed” UTCs where a UTC has both personnel and equipment requirements,
         but shares the equipment with a sister organization already deployed, the UTC should
         be assessed as Red, since it does not currently have the required equipment prior to
         deployment. For a rainbowed UTC a comment should be entered to indicate the status
         of the shared equipment.
         3.4.7.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Equipment and supplies are required to be available to
         redeploy within 72 hours, unless otherwise directed by the MAJCOM.
     3.4.7.2. The equipment condition area is used to determine the combat essential and
     support equipment that can be made ready within the UTC's response time to undertake
     the mission. Units assess the equipment condition for combat essential and support
     equipment based on the availability of required equipment.
         3.4.7.2.1. Units should report the status of UTCs as stand-alone requirements. For
         “rainbowed” UTCs where a UTC has both personnel and equipment requirements,
         but shares the equipment with a sister organization already deployed, the UTC should
         be assessed as Red, since it does not currently have the required equipment prior to
         deployment. For a rainbowed UTC a comment should be entered to indicate the status
         of the shared equipment.
     3.4.7.3. The training assessment area indicates the status of training needed to support
     the mission for which a UTC is designed (MISCAP). All personnel assigned to a UTC
     must have all required mission and skill level training completed IAW applicable
     directives and instructions at the time of assessment. Individual training not required by
     the UTC (MISCAP or manpower detail) will not affect the readiness assessment but will
     be captured for deployment readiness tracking.
     3.4.7.4. DELETED
     3.4.7.5. (Added-USAFE) Personnel are considered available if they are assigned to a
     unit, physically present at home station or can be present within the prescribed response
     time, and are not restricted from deploying or employing. The Military Personnel Data
 28                          AFI10-244_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


       System (MILPDS) deployment availability codes must                  support   availability
       determination. Commanders determine availability as required.
           3.4.7.5.1. (Added-USAFE) When an individual is 270 calendar days from his/her
           DEROS, assess the UTC “Yellow”, and when an individual is 180 calendar days from
           his/her DEROS, assess the UTC “Red”.
           3.4.7.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Personnel filling a UTC requirement may be considered
           available to deploy if the projected TDY completion date is more than 30 days prior
           to their report not later than date (RNLTD), separation date, or retirement date.
           3.4.7.5.3. (Added-USAFE) When assessing the status of UTCs in ART, report skill
           level substitutions as either Yellow or Red, if the substitutions are not specifically
           allowed in the UTC Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP). Report UTCs with
           skill level substitution as Yellow when they can meet the UTC MISCAP and include
           a remark specifying the skill level substitution. Report UTCs with skill level
           substitution as Red when they cannot meet the UTC MISCAP. This is not to be
           confused with skill level substitutions authorized during actual sourcing, as outlined
           in AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution.
   3.4.8. Commanders are expected to use their judgment during assessments of missing or
   deficient capabilities (i.e. shortage of one computer may not make a UTC red; shortage of
   one generator may, similarly a member on a 72 hour medical profile would not require a
   UTC status change, whereas a person with a broken leg would). Remarks should reflect
   training requirements and/or resource actions necessary to improve the readiness status.
   3.4.9. In addition and independent of the stoplight (Green, Yellow, Red) assessment, each
   unit will indicate if a UTC is tasked to deploy and, if tasked, whether it can meet theater
   specific requirements including line remarks IAW timing criteria.
   3.4.10. When substitutions, not explicitly allowed in the MISCAP but authorized IAW AFI
   10-401 guidance, are used in ART reporting, they will be noted using the Standard
   Assessment Remark of AFSC, Skill Level Training or Grade, and drive at a minimum a
   "Yellow" UTC assessment.
   3.4.11. If a portion of a UTC is tasked to deploy, the remaining assets continue to be
   available for the entire deployment eligibility window. Commanders should indicate this in a
   remark.
   3.4.12. Commanders will continue to submit an overall UTC assessment that treats the
   deployed portion of that UTC as available and healthy unless circumstances/information
   warrants otherwise. Commanders will also continue to submit an overall UTC assessment for
   complete UTCs that have deployed. If a UTC is deployed and was being assessed as Green,
   commanders will continue to assess the UTC as Green unless circumstances/information
   warrants otherwise. For UTCs that were deployed while being assessed Yellow or Red,
   commanders will continue with that assessment until circumstances/information warrants
   upgrading the assessment.
3.5. Assess the overall health of a UTC. The UTC represents a capability that is assessed
using the category areas described in paragraph 3.4.7. The overall assessment will be rated using
the following guidelines and the ART Monitor Assessment checklist (Attachment 2).
AFI10-244_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                  29


3.5. (USAFE)Theater-specific requirements are not assessed during the UTC
assessment. This assessment will be made during the “Tasked to Deploy Assessment” phase,
once the UTC is tasked to deploy. The “Tasked to Deploy Assessment” will not change the
status (Red/Yellow/Green) of the UTC.
   3.5.1. Green. The complete UTC to include the exact MANFOR and LOGFOR equipment
   with only MISCAP explicit substitutions and all training for the AEF allocated UTC are
   available for deployment within 72 hours of notification or sooner if subject to more stringent
   criteria.
   3.5.2. Yellow. The UTC has a missing or deficient MANFOR or LOGFOR requirement; but
   that missing or deficient capability does not prevent the UTC from being tasked and
   accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation. This includes AFI 10-403
   approved standard substitutions. Provide a detailed explanation in remarks. Describe the
   condition, the corrective action and provide a projected get-well date. In the event that a skill
   level or grade is dependent only on a members‟ promotion it still needs to be noted and still
   drives a „Yellow‟ state.
   3.5.3. Red = No Go. The UTC has a missing or deficient capability that prevents the UTC
   from being tasked and accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation.
   Provide detailed explanation of the shortfall in remarks. Describe the shortfall, the corrective
   action and provide a get-well date.
      3.5.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Unit monitor must contact the FAM prior to assessing a UTC
      as Bad/Incorrectly Postured. When UTCs are determined to be bad/incorrectly postured,
      input specific rationale as to why the UTC is suspected of being bad or incorrectly
      postured using the appropriate comment area on the deficiency screen. For incorrectly
      postured UTCs, input the USAFE FAM's email address (listing provided at
      https://rso.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-ED-FE-01).
   3.5.4. Incorrectly Postured. This rating is to be used when a UTC is postured against a unit
   in ART and the unit commander believes this to be in error. Assigning this rating in ART
   will generate an email to the MAJCOM ART POC, raising the issue with the MAJCOM
   FAM to help determine whether or not the UTC is correctly postured. A detailed explanation
   is to be provided in the email of why the UTC should not be postured against your unit. This
   information will be forwarded to the MAJCOM UTC FAM ,who postured the UTC against
   the unit, for coordination and resolution.
   3.5.5. Think of the monthly assessment as a Yes/No process (Figure 3.1). Additionally, a
   Yes/No process can be used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it can meet
   theater specific requirements (Figure 3.2).

Figure 3.1. Monthly Assessment Process.




3.6. Tasked to Deploy Assessment. Upon deployment notification, commanders owning
UTC‟s tasked to deploy, in whole or in part, are required to assess the UTCs ability to meet
theater specific requirements to include line remarks. Each unit commander‟s UTC tasking
assessment is the Air Force‟s certification of forces. This assessment is independent of the
overall UTC stoplight assessment. As an example, a UTC may not have a person with specific
skill level and experience required by line remarks, however the UTC status (Green, Yellow,
Red) does not change since the stoplight assessment is based on the UTCs ability to deploy
anywhere in the world at the time of the assessment. Another example is a Red UTC assessment
due to equipment which could be tasked to support a personnel only theater requirement. Even
though it can meet that specific deployment tasking, the overall status is still Red.
   3.6.1. A Yes/No process can be used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it
   can meet theater specific requirements (Figure 3.2).
   3.6.2. (Added-USAFE) When UTC/ALN is marked as “Tasked - Yes” the unit ART
   monitor will identify what the UTC/ULN is tasked for in the remark area (i.e. line #, PID,
   ULN, ETL, & any line remarks).
   3.6.3. (Added-USAFE) When a UTC is partially tasked and the unit can meet the theater
   requirements, mark the UTC as “Tasked - Yes” and “Meets - Yes”. Additionally, the unit
AFI10-244_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                31


  must provide a list of remaining available resources in the general/tasked remark area. The
  remark area becomes available upon selecting “Yes” or “No” under the “can meet theater
  requirements” column.
  3.6.4. (Added-USAFE) When possible, units tasked to deploy under a non-postured UTC
  will identify a postured UTC with similar requirements and mark it as “Tasked - Yes” and
  “Meets - Yes.” The unit must identify the actual tasked UTC in the general remark area.
  3.6.5. (Added-USAFE) When indicating “Meets - No” outline the planned action in the
  general remark area. Units will continually update the general/tasked remark area with the
  status of the waiver request or reclama until final disposition.
  3.6.6. (Added-USAFE) Commanders may reclama any 179-day AEF tasking for Airmen
  on 12- or 15-month short tours. USAFE/CV delegated reclama approval authority to
  USAFE/A3 to streamline/expedite resourcing. Commanders may, however, choose to
  deploy these airmen if mission allows and it is in the best interest of the Air Force.
     3.6.6.1. (Added-USAFE) Commanders will use the following steps in order to
     accurately identify USAFE short tour airmen in MILPDS and AEF Reporting Tool
     (ART):
         3.6.6.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Assign Deployment Availability (DAV) Code 65
         (Commander‟s Option) in MILPDS via the Force Support Squadron to any individual
         on a 12- or 15-month tour. These individuals will not be considered available for
         179-day taskings, but may fill taskings at the commander‟s discretion. This policy is
         intended to provide home station continuity; however, this policy does not preclude a
         commander from deploying an Airman if mission allows and it is in the best interests
         of the Air Force.
         3.6.6.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Assess applicable UTCs as "Yellow" in the ART. Use
         the following remarks for the ALN of the short-tour Airman: “Member is on a 12- or
         15-month tour and is not available for 179-day or longer AEF rotation per
         USAFE/CV direction. If tasked, the unit will reclama.”
     3.6.6.2. (Added-USAFE) MAJCOM Functional Area Managers (FAM) and unit
     commanders will use the following procedures for airmen serving 12- or 15-month tours
     who receive a 179-day tasking:
         3.6.6.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Prior to tasking bases with short tour airmen, FAMs will
         check the availability of airmen on 24-month or longer tours. If there are no airmen
         on 24-month or longer tours available to fill the 179-day requirement, the FAM will
         process a UIC change in the Reclama Processing Tool (RPT) to a USAFE unit that is
         able to fill the requirement. If no other USAFE unit is able to fill the requirement, the
         FAM will initiate a MAJCOM Condition 5 Reclama in RPT. FAMs will clearly state
         reason for reclama in RPT as follows: “Tasked unit only has 12- or 15-month (as
         appropriate) personnel available for this 179-day tasking. No other fill available in
         USAFE.”
         3.6.6.2.2. (Added-USAFE) If the tasking flows to the Wing and no individual other
         than 12- or 15-month tour personnel are available, the unit will initiate a Condition 5
         reclama in RPT. The unit will clearly state the reason for the reclama in RPT:
 32                           AFI10-244_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


           “Tasked unit only has 12- or 15-month (as appropriate) personnel available for this
           179-day requirement. No other fill available in the Wing.” FAMs will either retract
           the reclama and process a UIC change to another USAFE unit able to fill the tasking;
           or, concur with the reclama by adding the following comment: “No other fill
           available in USAFE.” FAM will confirm via an electronic Staff Summary (eSS),
           signed at the MAJCOM Director level, to HQ USAFE/A3JA the status of tasked unit
           as having only 12- or 15-month tour personnel available and the non-availability of
           other units in USAFE. Once MAJCOM-Director signature is obtained, route the eSS
           to HQ USAFE/A3JA. HQ USAFE/A3JA will staff the eSS to USAFE/A3 for
           approval.
           3.6.6.2.3. (Added-USAFE) If a Condition 5 reclama is initiated at a Wing and
           concurred with by the FAM as a result of not having an Airman available who is on a
           tour longer than 12- or 15-months, the USAFE/CV has delegated reclama approval
           authority to USAFE/A3.

3.7. Remarks. Plain language supplemental remarks are a critical component of the ART report
and are used as a management tool. Remarks are required if a unit is less than fully capable in
any reportable area. Remarks are used to identify trends and to redirect resources if necessary.
Remarks are mandatory for UTCs assessed Yellow and Red. All status remarks will be
standardized remarks from Standard Assessment Remarks listing maintained within ART (ART
Guidance under Information Tab) only. However, the Commander‟s Remarks section is an
additional avenue that should be utilized to relay vital information that affects the readiness or
AFI10-244_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                 33


availability of the UTC. This area of ART can be utilized regardless of the readiness status of the
UTC (i.e., Green, Yellow, or Red).
   3.7.1. Commanders use the remarks and associated get-well-dates (GWD) to explain and
   amplify data contained in ART reports. Write remarks in plain text English and ensure they
   contain all appropriate details such as AFSCs, projected improvements, workarounds, etc.
   Remarks should be sufficient to allow responsible managers to take specific corrective
   action. The remarks sections are not size limited.
   3.7.2. As applicable, list resource types with associated deficiencies; state numbers required,
   assigned, and available; explain the cause of the problem, if known; identify previously
   requested assistance; identify remedial actions in progress, highlight further actions required,
   and provide a projection of when the readiness status will change.
   3.7.3. Air Force standard abbreviations are acceptable. However, non-common, unique, or
   unit/system/functional specific acronyms will be defined when first used in a report. Do not
   refer to previous reports (ART is dynamic and will not retain previous remarks).
   3.7.4. Wing Commanders should challenge inadequate remarks. MAJCOMs will sample,
   review, and assess adequacy of unit remarks.
   3.7.5. (Added-USAFE) Deficiencies will be identified in the status remark area, by
   category: personnel, training, equipment/supply, and/or equipment/condition. These fields
   become available upon marking a UTCs status as “Red” or “Yellow”. The general remarks
   area associated with the tasked UTC, can or cannot meet theater requirements will be used
   for tasked or partially tasked UTCs. The “Commanders Comments” option allows reporting
   commanders to provide additional information not covered by other comment and remarks
   fields. The use of this field should be minimized and not used to identify UTC deficiencies,
   since the status remark fields serve this purpose.
3.8. When to Report. All Air Force and Air Force gained units will submit and update UTC
assessments every 30 calendar days. The Air Force goal for on-time reporting is 97%.
   3.8.1. Upon notification of a significant event that changes the assessment of a UTC the unit
   commander will submit an out-of-cycle report within 24 hours of the change. This includes
   notification of a UTC change or addition.
       3.8.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Unit, NAF and Directorate ART Monitors will check ART
       every Wednesday and Friday for Not Reported UTCs. These UTCs will be assessed
       within 24 hours.
       3.8.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Unit, NAF, and directorate ART monitors will update the
       status of all posted UTCs at a minimum twice a month. This update will be accomplished
       during the second and last duty weeks of each month to ensure standardization across the
       command.
           3.8.1.2.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) Ensure unit commanders and Agency Chiefs
           are engaged with AEF posturing for their unit and ART reporting is accomplished
           twice a month at a minimum in accordance with the dates in (Attachment 3) or within
           24 hours when a UTC changes deployability status. Updates made during the Mid-
           Month timeframe will be accomplished by Noon on Friday.
 34                         AFI10-244_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


          3.8.1.2.2. (Added-MILDENHALL) ART Monitors will check ART every
          Wednesday and Friday no later than (NLT) 1100 hours for Not Reported UTCs and
          will make updates within 24 hours.
   3.8.2. Additionally, commanders owning UTC's tasked to deploy will submit via ART an
   assessment of their ability to support the tasking, including theater specific requirements,
   within five (5) days of receipt of a deployment notification.
   3.8.3. Units owning a UTC tasked to deploy will reset the deployment status from "Yes" to
   "No" not later than five (5) calendar days after the tasked resources return to home station.
3.9. Where to Report. ART is accessed from the AFPC/DPW homepage located at the
following URL https://aefcenter.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil/. Click on the “AEF UTC
Reporting Tool” link. Users are required to have SIPRNET access in order to submit ART
updates.
   3.9.1. (Added-USAFE) Form Adopted: AF Form 2426, Training Request and Completion
   Notification.

                                 ART MONITOR ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST

         Table A2.1. ART Monitor Assessment Checklist.
All units MUST use this checklist as a tool to assess UTC Personnel, Training, Equipment/   Current AEF
Supplies and Equipment Condition (PTEC) monthly in ART. ALWAYS consider what the
UTC's MISCAP states when assessing.
GREEN = There are absolutely NO UTC deficiencies in any of the four assessed areas          G
YELLOW = UTC can meet MISCAP but there are deficiencies to be noted                             Y
RED = UTC cannot meet MISCAP due to too many deficiencies                                           R
BLACK = UTC is postured incorrectly and requires MAJCOM FAM attention.

Check the appropriate shaded block (G, Y, R) below, depending on how you answer the question. The
lowest rating in any area will drive the overall rating of the UTC. Any deficiencies must have remarks
and Get Well Dates (GWD); check each month for expiration. Only the FINAL rating is used in ART.
Refer to the MISCAP, MANFOR, LOGFOR, MILPDS, AFI 10-244 (Ch 3), AFI 10-401 and AFI 10-403.

Once an individual is associated to an AEF they cannot be changed without obtaining a MAJCOM/CV
waiver IAW AFI 10-401, 9.7.6

              USAFE ART STAFF ASSISTANCE VISIT (SAV) PROGRAM

A7.1. (USAFE) ART SAVs
   A7.1.1. (USAFE) The USAFE ART Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) is designed to assess
   Wing ART Manager and unit reporting compliance, with baseline standards, according to
   AFI 10-244, AFI 90-201 USAFE Supplement 1, and this supplement. In addition, provide
   operational requirements, training, and suggestions for improving Wing ART Manager
   overall effectiveness.
   A7.1.2. (USAFE) SAVs will be scheduled and conducted annually. The schedule will be
   transmitted to each unit and published at (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/
   EntryCop.asp?Filter=OO-OP-FE-01). A message will be sent to specific units, as applicable,
   if a date change is necessary. NOTE: Every effort will be made to ensure that the SAV is
   conducted prior to a Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI), Operational Readiness Inspection
   and/or Surety Inspection.
   A7.1.3. (USAFE) The most current UCI report will be used as the basis of measurement for
   all ART programs. The most current UCI ART checklists will be located on the USAFE
   Portal, USAFE Publications page under the “Checklists” heading.
   A7.1.4. (USAFE) The SAV will be conducted in conjunction with Wing ART Manager
   training, as required.
   A7.1.5. (USAFE) The SAV team will provide the Wing ART Manager with a message
   and/or e-mail confirming arrival/departure dates, team composition, Entry Authorization List
   (EAL) and in-brief/out-brief availability not later than 30 days before arrival. Team visits
   will normally be 3-5 days.          The Wing ART Manager will verify if the wing
   commander/alternate desires a SAV team chief in/out-brief and coordinate, appropriately. If
   an out-brief is desired, an appointment should be made for the last duty day of the visit.
A7.2. (USAFE) Non-compliant SAV results.
   A7.2.1. (USAFE) To ensure appropriate senior leadership involvement in non-compliant
   ART programs, wing commanders will ensure the Wing ART Manager prepares and submits
   a Get Well Plan to HQ USAFE/A3J no later than the date indicated in the SAV report.
   A7.2.2. (USAFE) The USAFE Readiness Measures office will conduct one-on-one training
   with the primary/alternate Wing ART Manager within 30 days of the SAV, if desired.
   Training is unit funded and conducted at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, to allow the Wing
   ART Manager uninterrupted personalized training.
   A7.2.3. (USAFE) The wing may request USAFE Readiness Measures personnel return, no
   earlier than 90 days from the initial SAV date, to ensure the wing program is in compliance
   according to the Unit Compliance Inspection Checklist and to provide one-on-one training to
   the Wing ART Manager. The wing will fund this secondary SAV.

A7.3. (USAFE) The respective HQ USAFE functional manager, and 2-letter directorate (SF,
SC etc.) are highly encouraged to develop ART reporting guides for their responsible area. An
area specific checklist/guide is desired to identify functionally unique ART requirements. If
developed, coordinate such guides through USAFE Readiness Measures and HQ USAFE/IG.
