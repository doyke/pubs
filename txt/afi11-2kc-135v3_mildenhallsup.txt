This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 11-2KC-
135V3, C/KC-135 Operations Procedures, 18 September 2008. This supplement establishes
specific operating procedures for KC-135 aircraft and aircrews assigned to the 100th Air
Refueling Wing (ARW), RAF Mildenhall, England. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the OPR, using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publications, 22 September 2009, prescribed by AFI 11-215,
from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
1.4.2.4. (Added) Waiver authority to AFI 11-2KC-135, Volume 3, Mildenhall Sup, is the 100th
Operations Group Commander (100 OG/CC) or their designated representative.
1.8.1. (Added) Improvement Recommendations. 100 OG/OGV encourages all aircrew members
to submit proposed changes to this regulation. Submit changes to this chapter on an AF Form
847 through channels to 100 OG/OGV.
2.5.1.1. (Added) Aircrew Responsibilities. The 100 ARW Command Post (Banter Control) is
the local command and control (C2) agency at RAF Mildenhall and is the focal point for all 100
 2                           AFI11-2KC-135V3_MILDENHALLSUP 10 NOVEMBER 2010


ARW mission support activities. The Pilot in Command must inform C2 of any factor that may
affect mission accomplishment. To assist in coordinating, the Pilot in Command must ensure all
mission timing, cargo load data, and pertinent mission changes are reported to Banter Control for
entry into the Global Decision Support System (GDSS). The following procedures will be
followed by all 100 ARW assigned and attached fliers.
2.5.1.2. (Added) Local Sorties. Aircrews will call Banter Control immediately after takeoff and
relay the actual time of departure (ATD).
2.5.1.3. (Added) Off-Station Missions. The Pilot in Command is responsible for reporting to the
controlling C2 agency, usually the USAFE Air Mobility Division (AMD) or the AMC Tanker
Airlift Control Center (TACC). For off-station training missions, the 100 ARW Command Post
is the controlling C2 agency. The Pilot in Command will ensure that all pertinent mission details
are annotated in GDSS to include a telephone number where the Pilot in Command can be
reached.
2.5.6.1. (Added) When approximately 30 minutes from landing, crews will relay to Banter
Control the estimated time of arrival (ETA), expected landing fuel load and aircraft maintenance
status codes in accordance with Attachment 3 (Added) of the basic instruction. Immediately
upon landing, relay to Banter Control the actual time of arrival (ATA), duration, and aircraft
maintenance status code or codes, if the maintenance codes have changed.
2.5.6.2. (Added) Aircrews should make every effort to land at their scheduled land time as
published in the flying schedule. All departures and arrivals are coordinated through the 100
AMXS for block-out and block-in crews at the hardstand. Underflys or overflys exceeding 0.3
hours will be coordinated with 351 ARS/DO (or designated representative) through the 100
OSS/OSOS (scheduling executer). This does not preclude crews from landing early due to safety
concerns, such as bird activity, crew fatigue, etc. This enables the Maintenance Operations
Center (MOC) and 100 AMXS to direct their maintenance activities to accommodate changes in
the schedule.
2.5.12. (Added) Deployed Locations. Deployed commanders will ensure all required mission
details and pertinent mission changes are reported to the appropriate C2 agency (normally AMD)
by any means available for entry into GDSS. As a last resort, pass off-station mission details to
the 100 ARW Command Post for entry into GDSS.
3.7.6. (Added) Aircrew Show Time for Local Missions. Standard aircrew show time for
dispatched (preplanned) local missions is 3 hours prior to scheduled takeoff. Show time for
dispatched formation missions is 3+15 hours prior to scheduled takeoff.
3.7.7. (Added) Mission Timing. Aircrews will arrive at the aircraft not later than 1+30 hours
prior to the scheduled takeoff time. The Pilot in Command will adjust their timing based upon
local conditions, scheduled activity, or mission complexity, but will coordinate through MOC if
timing changes by more than 15 minutes.
3.8.4. (Added) Aircrew members will not fly unless they have been notified of the flight in
advance and subsequently taken the proper crew rest. This is intended to avoid “line-of-sight”
same day scheduling.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_MILDENHALLSUP 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                      3


3.14.1. (Added) Orientation flight, incentive flight, familiarization flight, or space available
passengers will not be carried on any mission which penetrates airspace designated as a
hazardous duty area or which qualifies for hostile fire or imminent danger pay.
3.15.2.1. (Added) 352 SOG interfly. The 100 ARW/CC and 352 OG/CC have a letter of
agreement (LOA) outlining interfly procedures. 100 ARW crewmembers are authorized to fly
with the 352 SOG on training missions and vice versa. Follow the guidance of the LOA which is
available on the 100 OG/OGV CoP webpage.
4.4.1. (Added) Technical Assistance Service. The AC may request local technical assistance
from the on-duty KC-135R Instructor Pilot (Red Baron). Red Baron is available at all times and
can be contacted through the 100 ARW Command Post.
5.1.1.1. (Added) All locally produced aircrew aids (i.e. handouts, checklists, charts, graphs,
etc.) must be approved by 100 OG/OGV prior to release. The office symbol of the OPR and date
of issue will be placed on each aircrew aid. Each OPR is responsible for the accuracy and
currency of these items and will conduct, as a minimum, an annual review of these items and
coordinate changes, revisions through 100 OG/OGV.
5.15.2.6. (Added) Runway, Taxiway and Airfield Requirements. Runway available for a static
takeoff at Mildenhall is 9,821 feet from the tip of the second chevron (counted from the approach
end) using either under-run. There is no published runway gradient. For Runway 11, unless a
back taxi is performed the line up distances vary slightly depending on the entry taxiway. These
distances are as follows:

Figure 5.1. (Added) Line up distances.
         (From taxiway Alpha)                              (From taxiway Bravo)
STATIC :                      8,721               STATIC :                      8,821
STATIC-ROLLING:               8,621               STATIC-ROLLING:               8,721
ROLLING:                      8,221               ROLLING:                      8,321

NOTES:

1. Overruns/Underruns are 1,000 feet long at each end of the runway and are concrete. They
have the same weight bearing capacity as the runway. Underruns are available for departures.
Overruns do not meet departure clearance criteria and cannot be used in any departure
calculations as additional runway available for takeoff. Overruns can be used in calculating full
stop landing distance if necessary.

5.15.4.4. (Added) Due to Mildenhall’s narrow taxiways, taxi with the inboard engines to the
maximum extent possible. After landing, shut down the outboard engines when the appropriate
time has elapsed unless engine maintenance is required. Performing 180-degree turns on the
runway porous friction surface is prohibited.
5.15.4.5. (Added) RCR Requirements. Do not taxi when the RCR is less than 07. Do not
takeoff when the RCR is less than 08. Do not land when the RCR is less than 08. For operations
at Mildenhall and for off-station training missions, the 100 OG/CC is the waiver authority for
operation below these minimums down to those established by T.O. 1C-135(K)R-1-1.

5.18.5.1. (Added) Aircrews will coordinate through Banter Control for 100 OG/CC approval to
jettison fuel for situations other than emergencies. When requesting permission in the clear over
the UHF radio, use the phrase "adjust gross weight". Following 100 OG/CC approval, advise
ATC and proceed to the fuel jettison area. The Mildenhall fuel jettison area is on the MLD 056
radial between 55 and 75 DME at FL200. Make right hand turns to the south.
5.18.5. 2 Annotate the amount of fuel jettisoned on the DD Form 791, Aerial Tanker In-Flight
Issue Log,1 December 2002, prescribed by DOD 4140.25-M and AF Form 3578, Tanker Activity
Report (provide a brief reason for the fuel jettison on the back of the AF Form 3578).
5.20.6. (Added) The 100 ARW Safety Office maintains RAF Mildenhall’s Bird Aircraft Strike
Hazard (BASH) program. A local bird control program provides on-site service whenever the
airfield is in operation. Aircrews requiring implementation of bird control measures can receive
immediate assistance by notifying the control tower.
5.20.7. (Added) Aircrews will ensure that all birdstrikes are reported to Wing Safety and the
Wing Command Post as soon as possible after the incident to aid in subsequent investigation.
5.21.2. (Added) Operations Group Standardization and Evaluation will manage the FCF/OCF
program on behalf of the 100 OG/CC. To avoid duplication, all FCF/OCF guidance is contained
in the Mildenhall supplement to AFI 21-101_AMCSUP_MILDENHALLSUP, Aerospace
Equipment Maintenance Management, 28 July 2010.
5.22.1. (Added) Participation in Aerial Events. The Pilot in Command will coordinate with 100
OG/OGV and 100 OG/CC prior to participating in an aerial event, airshow, or off-station static
display. The Pilot in Command must be familiar with AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and
Procedures 4 May 2006 and both USAFE and 3AF supplements.
5. 26 (Added) Towing Operations. For All Towing Operations utilizing 100 ARW aircrews as
Brake Operators the following guidelines will be used:
5.26. 1 (Added) The Towing Supervisor has overall responsibility for ensuring the tow
operation is completed safely and tow team members fulfill responsibilities. Aircrews
performing towing operations must receive the proper briefings and instruction on towing
procedures from the Towing Supervisor prior to and during all towing operations.
5.26. 2 (Added) Once towing operations have begun (signaled by the Towing Supervisor’s
initial team briefing) the Towing Supervisor is responsible for all actions related to aircraft
movement and all personnel will comply with his/her direction.
6.1.2.3. (Added) Aircrew Clothing Requirements. For all flights, all crewmembers will have in
their possession a flight jacket (summer, winter, or leather).
6.2.9. 3 (Added) For all local flights, only one helmet is required to be carried in order to check
hatches in flight if necessary. For all off-station flights, all primary crew members will carry
their helmets in the event that the quick-don masks become inoperable.
6.4.1. (Added) Aircrew Publications Requirements. Publications and technical orders are
maintained by 351 ARS/CCV and will be kept on locally assigned aircraft or in 351 ARS
Dispatch office, at the OG/CC discretion. 100 Air Refueling Wing (ARW) flight publication and
technical order requirements are as specified in the 100th Operations Group Flight Crew
Information File (FCIF) Library Volume 1, Part C (Squadron Read File). 100 ARW
AFI11-2KC-135V3_MILDENHALLSUP 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                    5


crewmembers will maintain applicable publications and technical orders as specified in the 100
ARW FCIF.
6.4.1.1. (Added) OGV will maintain a back up file for electronic publications on a separate
drive in case the electronic publications folder gets corrupted or damaged.
6.4.2. (Added) Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron (EARS) Aircrews. 351 ARS/CCV will
supply EARS staff with applicable USAFE supplements to publications required for flight. In
addition, the EARS staff will have the following publications readily available for aircrew use
during mission planning: USAFE Instruction 11-201, Flying Operations Conducted at USAF
Occupied Royal Air Force Installations in the United Kingdom, 29 January 2007, Mildenhall
Instruction 13-201, Airfield and Air Traffic Control Operations , 28 July 2010, 100 ARW
Inflight Guide.
6.10.5. (Added) Mission kits. Mission kits are maintained by 351 ARS/CCV and are kept in
Dispatch. Checking out a PFPS computer is at AC’s discretion.
6.17.1. (Added) Weather Minimums For Takeoff. For both training and operational missions,
aircrews will not taxi until the RVR is reported at or above the RVR required for takeoff.
6.18.1. (Added) A list of approved diversion, alternate airfields can be found in Attachment 3
(Added) . The OPR for this list is 100 OG/OGV. OGV will review this list yearly and update it
as necessary. NOTE: This list in no way relieves the Pilot in Command of the responsibility to
check all applicable FLIP, NOTAMS, and the Air Mobility Command (AMC) Airfield
Suitability and Restrictions Report (including GDSS airfield data base) for possible airfield
restrictions.
6.41.2. (Added) RAF controlling agencies may require use of QFE altimeter settings for final
approach in lieu of QNH settings. The Pilot in Command may request QNH altimeter settings
unless they desire to fly the final approach using QFE. The Pilot in Command is responsible for
ensuring proper altimeter settings are entered, and that the entire crew understands the
appropriate procedures, including EGPWS limitations during QFE approaches.
6.43.2.1. (Added) If U.S. military or U.S. embassy storage facilities are available while off-
station, aircrew must use those facilities to store the classified items. If there is no appropriate
storage facility, store the classified material in the metal gun box. Lock the box using a GSA-
approved changeable combination padlock. Secure box to aircraft using provided lanyard. Use
tamper-proof evidence tape on the inside of the aft emergency and overwing hatches. Lock the
crew entry door and use tamper proof evidence tape on the outside of the door. Check all
evidence tape every 12 hours. If in crew rest, check tape within 1 hour of completing crew rest.
If you are unable to comply with any of the procedures, you must keep the classified under
constant surveillance (i.e. in your possession) for every minute of your ground time.
6.43.3.1. (Added) When an operational ground test of the Mode 4 is required, 100 OSS/OSO
will input a note into the MX remarks of GDSS for the mission by 1500L the day prior.
Additionally, aircrews will notify MOC when they show at the squadron no later than 2+45
hours prior to scheduled takeoff.
6.43.8.1. (Added) Aircrews will carry COMSEC on all local formation training missions, on all
priority 1A and 1B missions, and when dictated by scheduling. The 351 ARS/DO is the waiver
authority for local COMSEC requirements.
 6                           AFI11-2KC-135V3_MILDENHALLSUP 10 NOVEMBER 2010


6.43.8.2. (Added) Aircrew will load secure voice on all 1A and 1B missions and randomly
selected sorties as annotated in the GDSS remarks. All C2 radio calls to include mission
changes, aircraft status changes, receiver status checks, timing changes, takeoff times, and
inbound calls will be transmitted via secure radio on Command Post’s primary frequency. Every
radio call normally made to Banter Ops, Banter MOC, or Execution, will be made to Banter Ops
“in the green” for these missions. Banter Ops will relay all information to the appropriate
agency. On-time takeoffs and mission timing are of higher priority than secure communications.
If there is a process failure with checking-out COMSEC, loading secure, or other radio
malfunctions, try to pass sensitive information via cell phone or SATCOM. If those options are
not available, transmit in the clear to Banter Ops. Report any deviations to this procedure on the
back of the AF Form 3578, Tanker Activity Report, explaining the cause of the process failure.
6.45.1. (Added) If a mission cancels after the AC has accepted the aircraft for flight, the aircrew
will bring the aircraft forms to maintenance debrief.
6.45.2. (Added) After parking the aircraft, crew chiefs will connect their headsets to the aircraft
intercom. If the aircraft is Code 2 or 3, the crew chief will notify the aircrew if a specialist is
available to come on-board the aircraft for debrief. Ensure power remains available for the
affected system. If required, the crew chief will notify the aircrew what aircraft systems need to
remain powered on for troubleshooting with the specialist. Aircrew will then shut down the
aircraft using the ENGINE SHUTDOWN checklist except for those systems maintenance has
requested to remain powered on. If no specialist has arrived after 10 minutes of block-in, the
crew will continue to shut down the remaining aircraft systems and then proceed to building 809.
Aircrews should not normally delay more than 15 minutes from block-in time at the jet to debrief
with the systems specialist.
8.5.6.2.5. (Added) When in the vicinity of Mildenhall, report any spotlighting or lasing
incidents to Banter Control using the brevity word "Prism". Example: "Banter Control, Quid 42
Prism at 2238Z over EA1".
9.3.1.1. (Added) ACs certified to accomplish their own touch and go landings may do so with
any mission qualified pilot.
9.3.1.2. (Added) ACs certified to supervise other pilots’ touch and go landings may supervise
the touch and go landings of any AC or experienced FP as documented on the “letter of Xs.”
9.3.2.9. (Added) Practice 30 flap full-stop landings will only be flown under IP supervision.
9.3.2.10. (Added) For circling transition training at Lakenheath, the following approaches may
be requested.
9.3.2.10.1. EGUL HI/LOW ILS RWY 24, Circle RWY 06.
9.3.2.10.2. EGUL HI/LOW TACAN RWY 24, Circle RWY 06.
9.3.2.10.3. All other circling approaches overfly local communities or have additional RAPCON
restrictions and will not be approved for transition training. Aircrews should avoid over-flight of
Lakenheath Village and Brandon while circling. For purposes other than training, crews are
authorized to fly any approach required to land the aircraft at Lakenheath.
9.12. (Added) Engine-Running Crew Change (ERCC) Procedures. The following procedures
will be used when performing ERCCs.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_MILDENHALLSUP 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                    7


9.12.1. (Added) Plan to accomplish the ERCC on taxiway Delta North. If taxiway Delta North
is unavailable, coordinate with ground control for an alternate location.
9.12.2. (Added) ERCC. Off-going crew responsibilities:
9.12.2.1. (Added) Prior to landing, pass required maintenance information, landing fuel,
estimated chock time, to Banter MOC.
9.12.2.2. (Added) Compute brake energy limits and required ground cooling time.
9.12.2.3. (Added) Consider the number and type of passengers onboard when determining
whether to shutdown engines for deplaning (i.e. maintenance personnel vs. civilians unfamiliar
with flightline dangers). If only aircrew members are departing, engine shutdown is not
required. If passengers are involved, the Pilot in Command should shut down engines #1 and #2.
(Added) A qualified crew member will be on the ground to assist passenger loading/unloading
and act as a safety observer. If maintenance is unavailable for engine restarts, deplane one crew
member to ensure the area behind the aircraft is clear and monitor the engine start.
9.12.2.4. (Added) The Pilot in Command will set the parking brakes before opening the crew
entry hatch (opening the crew entry hatch signals the on-coming crew that they are cleared to
approach the aircraft).
9.12.2.5. (Added) Complete the necessary AFTO Form 781 entries before departing the aircraft.
Take the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document to file with the post-
mission paperwork (the two flights will be annotated on separate AFTO Form 781s).
9.12.2.6. (Added) Depart the aircraft with personal professional gear and COMSEC while the
Pilot in Command or copilot guards the brakes. NOTE: Before departing, each aircrew member
must secure all loose items to prevent foreign object damage (FOD).
9.12.2.7. (Added) Leave FLIP materials on the aircraft.
9.12.2.8. (Added) The off-going Pilot in Command will brief the oncoming Pilot in Command
on significant weather conditions, aircraft maintenance status, fuel load, panel operations, takeoff
weight, CG, brake energy limits, cooling time required, and any other pertinent information that
may affect the flight. Off-going boom operators will perform the After Landing Checklist, and
unless extenuating circumstances exist, leave the nose gear ground downlock out and stowed and
turn the nacelle lights off.
9.12.2.9. (Added) If any maintenance discrepancies were written up, the off-going crew will
debrief the appropriate maintenance personnel.
9.12.2.10. (Added) Prior to departing the aircraft, all aircrew members will don proper hearing
protection.
9.12.3. (Added) ERCC. On-coming crew responsibilities:
9.12.3.1. (Added) Show time is 2 hours prior to the scheduled ERCC takeoff time.
9.12.3.2. (Added) Coordinate transportation to depart building 809 ten minutes prior to the off-
going crew's land time.
9.12.3.3. (Added) Do not approach the aircraft until the crew entry hatch has been opened.
 8                           AFI11-2KC-135V3_MILDENHALLSUP 10 NOVEMBER 2010


9.12.3.4. (Added) On-coming boom operators will bring water jugs for their portion of the
ERCC.
9.12.3.5. (Added) Coordinate with transportation to remain at the aircraft until the ERCC crew
departs the aircraft to transport them to debrief.
9.12.3.6. (Added) Prior to approaching the aircraft, all aircrew members will don proper hearing
protection.
9.12.3.7. (Added) Return FLIP materials at the completion of the flight.
9.13. (Added) Approved Transition Bases. A list of approved transition bases can be found in
Attachment 3 (Added). Operations Group Standardization and Evaluation is the OPR for this
list. They will review this list yearly and update as necessary. NOTE: The Pilot in Command will
check all applicable FLIP, NOTAMS, ASRR, and GDSS for possible airfield restrictions. The
Pilot in Command must call the control tower at the intended transition base prior to takeoff to
book the practice diversion or transition.
12.7. (Added) Deicing. If required, aircrews will coordinate with 100 ARW MOC for deicing
the aircraft no later than 2+45 hours prior to takeoff. De-icing may be accomplished prior to the
aircrew showing at the aircraft if obvious icing conditions are detected by ground maintenance
personnel.
12.8. (Added) Any aircraft experiencing an un-commanded stabilizer trim malfunction will be
impounded immediately upon landing. The aircrew will coordinate with the Pro Super via
Banter MOC to meet the aircraft when it taxis into parking.
12.9. (Added) When weather conditions dictate, cycling of the APU doors (frozen door check)
should be accomplished with a crew chief present to minimize the risk of shearing the pins.
13.7.4. (Added) Post-flight towing operations with space available passengers on board should
be avoided at RAF Mildenhall. Aircrews will request a taxi-on parking spot from the MOC (via
command post) prior to landing when space-available passengers are on board. If towing is
required with space-available passengers onboard, every attempt will be made to deplane them
prior to conducting towing operations.
14.2.1.1. (Added) When flying on a AMC-tasked and 618 TACC flight managed mission 100
OG aircrew will use the fuel planning guidance found AFI 11-2KC-135V3_AFGM1, Flying
Operations, Guidance Memorandum, 2 Nov 2009.
14.2.1.2. (Added) 603 AMD tasked and local flights. Aircrews will ensure fuel loads are
planned to allow for a minimum of 23,000 pounds of fuel at the IAF or start descent point when
recovering at Mildenhall. If fuel loads do not meet this requirement, contact 100 OSS/OSOS
(Wing Executer) immediately to coordinate additional fuel requirements. NOTE: The 23,000
pounds of fuel allows for an approach and missed approach at Mildenhall and then arrival at any
of the approved diversion, alternate airfields listed in Attachment 3 (Added) (except Moron and
Rota) with no less than required fuel reserves. Crews will request fuel load adjustments through
scheduling only. The OG/CC (or designated representative) is the approval authority.
14.2.2.1.1. (Added) Fuel load changes at home station. 100 OSS/OSO will coordinate all fuel
loads requirements at 1500L the day prior to the mission. If the actual fuel load exceeds the
required fuel load by more than 5,000 lbs or if fuel load requirements change after 1500L the day
prior, notify the scheduling executer immediately. If the ramp fuel load exceeds 5,000 lbs defuel
AFI11-2KC-135V3_MILDENHALLSUP 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                   9


to an appropriate fuel load (time and manpower permitting). When there is a conflict between an
on-time departure and defueling, the scheduling executer will determine which takes precedence.
Coordinate all fuel load changes as early as possible through the scheduling executer, who will in
turn coordinate with maintenance and receiver units as applicable.
14.4.2.11. (Added) Check receiver status through command post before engine start. If receiver
status is unavailable prior to engine start, continue with engine-start procedures. Obtain receiver
status prior to launch. If accomplishing a silent launch, then there is no requirement to check
receiver status prior to engine start unless specified in the communications plan, OPORD,
FRAG, or mission directive.
14.4.2.12. (Added) Shutdown unnecessary engines for delays of 30 minutes or more. If
maintenance is unavailable for engine restarts, deplane one crew member to ensure the area
behind the aircraft is clear and monitor the engine start.
14.4.2.13. (Added) Taxi to parking and shutdown all engines for delays of 60 minutes or more.
15.2.1.4. (Added) MPRS refueling with the flaps extended is not authorized.
15.11.3. (Added) EMCON Levels for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Refueling. EMCON 1
should be used for all FMS sorties conducted for training. This will not preclude crews from
using more restrictive EMCON levels for operational missions or missions that include SPINS
directing more restrictive EMCON levels.
16.1.4. (Added) The 100 OG standard is to use the "same day mission plan" option. This,
however, does not preclude aircrew members from mission planning the day prior if they desire.
16.5.3. (Added) Go/No-Go Procedures. See AFI 11-202V2, Mildenhall Supplement 1 for
current Go/ No-Go Procedures.
16. 7 (Added) Post-Mission Paperwork. For all missions terminating off station, the Pilot in
Command will fax, as soon as practical after landing, the completed post-mission paperwork
(AFTO Form 781, Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, AF Form 3578, Tanker Activity
Report, 0, and DD Form 791, Aerial Tanker In-Flight Issue Log, , to the scheduling executor at
DSN 238-8675. Upon returning to Mildenhall, process the original paperwork as normal.
16.7.1. (Added)    The following post-mission documentation will be completed after each
mission:
16.7.1.1. (Added) AFTO Form 781, Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document,
16.7.1.2. (Added) Corrected copy USAFE Form 615, Flight Authorization.
16.7.1.3. (Added) AF Form 3578, Tanker Activity Report, (with 100 OSS/OSOS mission review
overprint)
16.7.1.4. (Added) DD Form 791, Aerial Tanker In-Flight Issue Log,
16.7.1.5. (Added) Wing Safety Worksheet (if required)
18.5.5. (Added) The following frequencies are approved for use within the UK: 360.825 -
(formation inter-plane frequency) and 399.050 - (tanker common / red baron / scheduling
executor frequency).
20.17.1.(Added) Adopted Forms:

A3.1. (Added) Alternate Airfields. Airfields are listed in order of proximity (* indicates 24
hours/365 day availability). Coordinate with Banter Control prior to diverting for coordination
and assistance. If none of the above airfields are available for use on operational missions, The
Pilot in Command may, with 100 OG/CC approval, designate other suitable airfields to satisfy
alternate requirements.
   A3.1.1. (Added) All of the alternates listed only apply to missions intending to land at
   EGUN.
A3.2. (Added) Explanation of terms:
   A3.2.1. (Added) MH = initial magnetic heading.
   A3.2.2. (Added) ETE = amount of time to fly from Mildenhall to the diversion airfield at
   best range mach (does not include penetration).
   A3.2.3. (Added) FUEL(@FL) = fuel required at Mildenhall to execute an approach and
   missed approach, climb to depicted altitude, fly best range mach, and land at the alternate.
   All fuel computations are based on a 160,000 pound airplane. Time and fuel required for
   westerly alternates are based on winds of 270/ 050. (Added) Easterly diversions are based
   on “no-wind” conditions. All climbs are based on max climb thrust. NOTE: Fuel
   requirements DO NOT INCLUDE required shutdown fuel. The information is presented in
   this manner to allow aircrews to apply the data to any fuel panel restriction. The key to this
   presentation is to honor any fuel tank restriction and shutdown with 8,800 pounds of usable
   fuel as prescribed in AFI 11-KC-135V3, paragraph 14.2.2.
   A3.2.4. (Added)       LNDG DIST = actual runway length available for landing.
   NOTES:
   1. (Added) For filing purposes, Lakenheath can only be used for crosswind considerations.
   2. (Added) Lost communications procedures are available in RAF FLIP TERMINAL
   CHARTS BOOKLET VOLUME 1. These procedures are required to use EGQL as an
   alternate.
   3. (Added) Airfield has obstacles. Headquarters approval/advisory not required provided
   airfield obstacles and restrictions are briefed (a review of the current online ASRR fulfills
   this requirement).
   4. (Added) Not all taxiways are 74’ wide. See the AMC GDSS airfield database and
   Summary of Airfield Restrictions for details.
   5. (Added) Restrictions imposed. See the AMC Summary of Airfield Restrictions.
   6. (Added) Use for operational missions only. Contact Banter Control prior to diverting
   (coordination with Madrid ODC is required). Diplomatic clearance required to leave.
   7. (Added) There is limited aircraft servicing capability (oil, hydraulic fluid, and fuel) at all
   European locations. AFI 11-2KC-135V3, paragraph 6.18 , lists minimum fuel requirements
   at an alternate base. Aircrews should consider the effects of lack of servicing capability in
   their decision to divert to a European base/airfield. If the decision is made early enough, fuel
   can be conserved and subsequently used to return to home station. In all cases, if an aircraft
   emergency causes diversion, then servicing capability is not an issue, but instead the safe
   divert of aircraft and aircrew.

           C/KC-135 AIRCRAFT CONFIGURATION FOR THE ADDENDA A

A5.1. (Added) 100 ARW aircraft configurations will follow the listing in AFI 11-2KC-135
V3 Addenda A and 1C-135-5-1 to the maximum extent possible. Authorized deviations to these
configurations will be stated in the implementing OPORD. Any other deviations to these
configurations will be coordinated and approved through tasking agency.
A5.2. (Added) Load planning worksheets will be sent to the 351 ARS program manager, no
later than 1 duty day prior to aircraft departure. Worksheets will list all cargo and passengers to
include weight and dimensions for load planning.
A5.3. (Added) Send the original load planning worksheets to the 100 MOS plans and
scheduling and one copy each to the 100 AMXS/MA and 100 OSS/OSOS. The 100 MOS plans
and scheduling will input a CAMS discrepancy against the applicable aircraft requiring a
configuration and weight and balance check. In the event configuration changes are required
after hours send copies of the load planning worksheet to AMXS/MXAAD for processing. The
MOS plans and scheduling, 100 AMXS/MXAAD if after hours, will provide the worksheet to
the crew chief who will have the worksheet available at the aircraft for completion. Finally, the
worksheet will be placed aboard the aircraft in the weight and balance book next to the Chart C.
A5.4. (Added) The 100 AMXS will apply the following procedures when configuring aircraft
using the AM/135 roller system:
   A5.4.1. (Added) The 100 AMXS will avoid, to the maximum extent possible, scheduling a
   roller-configured aircraft for a mission that does not require a roller configuration (non-
   roller).
   A5.4.2. (Added) Passenger information guides will be shipped from AF electronic
   publication site and placed in the back pouch of every airline-type seat and at every fifth
   troop seat in accordance with AFI 11-202V3 and MAJCOM supplement.
