                                     GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. General. This instruction, in conjunction with other governing directives and AFI (as
supplemented), prescribes procedures for operating F-35A aircraft under most circumstances. It
is not a substitute for sound judgment. Procedures not specifically addressed may be
accomplished if they enhance safe and effective mission accomplishment.
     1.1.1. Deviations. Deviations from these procedures require specific waiver unless an
     urgent requirement or an aircraft emergency dictate otherwise. In that case, the pilot in
     command will take the appropriate action to safely recover the aircraft.
     1.1.2. Supplements. Comply with applicable supplements to all guidance referenced in this
     Volume. Develop additional supplements IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
     Management.
     1.1.3. Aircraft Operating Limits (AOL). Nothing in this AFI overrides any existing AOL
     that may be in effect prior to full F-35A flight envelope clearance/release. Due to concurrent
     development and fielding of the F-35, there may be additional, more restrictive, AOLs based
     on restricted flight clearances. AOL restrictions are contained in F-35A Flight Series Data
     (FSD). Be familiar with all AOLs prior to the flight and comply accordingly. AOLs and FSD
     restrictions/ limitations supersede any item (i.e., airspeed, altitude, gravity load factor (G)-
     limits, maneuvering parameters, etc.) outlined in this AFI.
1.2. Waivers. Forward waiver requests through appropriate channels to the applicable
MAJCOM/A3 or equivalent, or Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) for those aircrew
and assets under the COMAFFOR’s oversight, for approval. The COMAFFOR, MAJCOM/A3
or equivalent will notify HQ ACC/A3 of waivers within 72 hours of issuance. Waiver authority
for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the supplement and approved through higher
level coordination authority.
1.3. Processing Changes.
     1.3.1. HQ ACC/A3 will coordinate all changes to the basic volume with using
     MAJCOM/A3s.

                                     MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The pilot in command of each aircraft and the designated flight lead are
ultimately responsible for mission planning. The operations and intelligence functions will
provide supplemental planning material and information as required to effectively accomplish
the assigned mission.
2.2. General Procedures.
   2.2.1. Accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission accomplishment to
   include fuel requirements, mission materials, deconfliction plan, communication plan and
   takeoff/ landing data.
   2.2.2. Standards. The squadron commander (SQ/CC) is the approval authority for squadron
   standards. Group/Wing standards may be published and approved by the operations group
   commander (OG/CC). All standards will be reviewed by Wing Stan/Eval for standardization
   and compliance with AFI 11-series guidance.
2.3. Mission Materials.
   2.3.1. Local Area Maps. A local area map is not required if the F-35A Tactical Situation
   Display/ unit pilot aid includes jettison areas, divert information, controlled bailout areas, and
   provides a local area map of sufficient detail to remain within assigned training areas.
   2.3.2. Charts. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) enroute charts may be used instead of
   maps on navigational flights within areas that are adequately covered by these charts.
   2.3.3. Low Altitude Maps. Refer to AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, and AFMAN
   11-217V2, Visual Flight Procedures, for low altitude map requirements, marking and
   procedures.
       2.3.3.1. Outside Continental United States (OCONUS), follow gaining MAJCOM,
       theater or host nation guidance on mission planning. If no such guidance exists, use the
       best charts or flight planning software overlay options available to accomplish the intent
       of maximizing traffic awareness and awareness of controlled airspace boundaries.
   2.3.4. Electronic Devices. Use of portable global positioning system (GPS) units,
   Electronic Flight Bag and/or e-tool display device in the cockpit during flight operations
   (electronic charts, approach procedures, etc.), if approved, will be IAW AFI 11-202V3 and
   AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP).
2.4. G-suit Use. IAW AFI 11-301V1_ACCSUP_I, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program,
the G-suit is required on all flights when 2 or more Gs are anticipated.
2.5. Unit Developed Checklists.
   2.5.1. Unit developed checklists may be used to supplement FSD checklists (except Nuclear,
   i.e., aircraft and weapons preflight) provided they contain, as a minimum, all items (verbatim
   and in order) listed in the applicable checklist. IAW AFI 11-215, forward unit-developed
   checklists to MAJCOM Stan/Eval and the flight manual manager for approval before use.
   2.5.2. Local Pilot Aids. Unit produced pilot aids will contain:
 8                                                               AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012


        2.5.2.1. Briefing guides;
        2.5.2.2. Local radio channelization and airfield diagrams;
        2.5.2.3. Emergency information (impoundment procedures, emergency action checklists,
        no radio (NORDO)/divert information, and search and rescue procedures, etc.);
        2.5.2.4. Appropriate alternate/divert airfield information, to include arresting gear
        information;
        2.5.2.5. Bailout and jettison areas;
        2.5.2.6. Cross-country procedures to include: command and control, Autonomic
        Logistics Information System (ALIS) requirements, engine documentation, Joint Oil
        Analysis Program samples, and aircraft servicing; and,
        2.5.2.7. Other information as deemed necessary by the unit. For example: stereo flight
        plans, turnaround procedures, local training areas, instrument pre-flight and/or alert
        procedures.
2.6. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH and Bird Watch
Conditions are defined in AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and Air
Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 91-212, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management
Techniques. The OG/CC will determine local BASH procedures.
     2.6.1. Takeoffs, landings, or low-levels within one hour of either sunrise or sunset during the
     phase II period increase likelihood of bird strike. Significant bird hazards are published in
     FLIP General Planning, the instrument flight rules (IFR) Supplement and local airfield
     guidance.
     2.6.2. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, pilots will make
     appropriate judgments based on observable bird conditions and seek assistance from local
     airfield personnel.
     2.6.3. Pilots will consider bird migratory patterns during enroute portion of the mission to
     minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model on United
     States Avian Hazard Advisory System (http://www.usahas.com), provides BASH
     information, including regionalized CONUS bird migration, Portable Flight Planning System
     software overlay, and latest news. See AFPAM 91-212 for additional information.
2.7. Fuel Conservation. Manage aviation fuel as a limited resource. Design procedures for
optimal fuel use and efficiencies throughout all phases of mission execution, to include ground
operations, flight plans, power settings and climb/descent profiles. Incorporate enroute tasks to
make maximum use of airborne learning opportunities.
2.8. Overwater. Planned flights over water, outside of the local training area (e.g.,
deployments, cross countries, Programmed Delivery for Maintenance (PDM) inputs, etc.) will be
accomplished two-ship as a minimum. Single ship over water flights, outside of the local training
area, require OG/CC approval.
2.9. Briefing/Debriefing.
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                      9


  2.9.1. Briefings. Flight leads are responsible for presenting a logical briefing that will
  promote safe, effective mission accomplishment. All pilots will attend the flight briefing
  unless previously coordinated with unit/squadron supervisors.
     2.9.1.1. Items published in AFIs, Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
     (AFTTPs), or squadron/wing standards and understood by all participants may be briefed
     as "standard." Items not pertinent to the mission do not need to be covered.
     2.9.1.2. Takeoff and landing data (TOLD) will be annotated on mission data cards. The
     minimum TOLD required is 1,000 foot acceleration check speed (if computed takeoff roll
     exceeds 2,500 feet); refused takeoff speed (stopping on runway remaining without
     exceeding brake energy limits); rotation speed; takeoff speed and distance; normal
     landing speed and distance; heavyweight (immediately after takeoff) landing speed and
     distance. Include wet or icy data if applicable based on location and potential for wet or
     icy runway surface.
     2.9.1.3. Review takeoff data, and ensure every member of the flight understands it. Place
     particular emphasis on takeoff and abort factors during abnormal situations such as
     short/wet/icy runway, heavy gross weights and non-standard cable configurations.
     2.9.1.4. When dissimilar aircraft are flown in formation, brief flight responsibilities,
     proper formation position (to ensure adequate wingtip clearance), aircraft-unique
     requirements and emergency considerations for each phase of flight.
     2.9.1.5. For all low altitude mission briefings, place emphasis on obstacle/ground
     avoidance, altitude-warning features, low altitude comfort level and complacency
     avoidance.
     2.9.1.6. Flight leads will ensure briefing start time provides adequate time to discuss
     required briefing items depending on complexity of the mission and pilot capabilities. As
     a minimum, begin briefings at least 1.5 hours before scheduled takeoff. Alert briefings
     will start in sufficient time to be completed prior to pilot changeover.
     2.9.1.7. Structure the flight briefing to accommodate the capabilities of each flight
     member.
     2.9.1.8. Brief an appropriate alternate mission for each flight. The alternate mission will
     be less complex than the primary and should parallel the primary mission. If an alternate
     mission does not parallel the primary mission, specific mission elements different than
     the primary mission should be briefed. Mission elements/events may be modified and
     briefed airborne as long as flight safety is not compromised. Flight leads will ensure all
     flight members acknowledge changes. Do not fly unbriefed missions/events.
     2.9.1.9. On multiple-go days when aircraft turn times do not allow follow-on mission
     brief(s) and only the initial flight brief is accomplished for all sorties, the following
     guidance applies:
         2.9.1.9.1. Upgrade missions will be flown on the first sortie (second sortie if the first
         is non-effective for weather, airspace, or maintenance). Subsequent missions will be
         of equal or less complexity with no additional upgrade training without OG/CC
         approval; and,
10                                                             AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012


         2.9.1.9.2. Participants in continuation training missions may fly their primary or
         alternate missions in any sequence.
     2.9.1.10. All missions will be debriefed and address in-flight execution, flight member
     responsibilities, deconfliction contracts, tactical employment priorities and sensor
     management. Review as much of the tactical portion of each mission as possible from the
     Portable Memory Device (PMD); however, flight leads will ensure that all portions of the
     missions are debriefed.
     2.9.1.11. Flight leads will review the tactical portions of the sortie to assess flight
     member's anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM) effectiveness. Evaluate not only during the
     G-awareness exercise, but also after the pilot has had time to fatigue--typically when the
     AGSM breaks down and G-induced loss of consciousness (GLOC) occurs. Pilots with
     poor AGSM technique or low G-tolerance will be identified to the operations officer. The
     SQ/CC has the option of directing refresher centrifuge training in accordance with AFI
     11-404, Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew.
  2.9.2. Deployed Operations, Exercise and Quick Turn Briefings. If all flight members
  attend an initial or mass flight briefing, the flight lead on subsequent flights need brief only
  those items that have changed from the previous flight(s).
  2.9.3. Briefing Guides. Briefing guides will be used to provide the flight lead/briefer with a
  reference list of items which may apply to particular missions. Items listed in Attachment 3
  may be briefed in any sequence. Units may augment these guides as necessary. Pending
  development by a higher headquarters, units that fly missions not covered by this instruction
  or its supplements will develop briefing guides for those missions and submit them to
  MAJCOM Stan/Eval for review and/or inclusion in this volume.
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                        11

                           NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Preflight and Strap-in.
   3.1.1. Do not place objects in or near the engine intakes.
   3.1.2. Secure personal items to avoid flight control/throttle interference.
   3.1.3. Ensure ejection seat survival kit deployment switch is in the AUTO position.
3.2. Ground Communications and Visual Signals. The pilot will accomplish the ground crew
briefing in accordance with the briefing guide contained in this instruction. Normally, the pilot
and ground crew will communicate using the intercom during all engine start, pre-taxi checks
and "Red Balls" anytime the aircraft engine is operating and maintenance technicians are
performing tasks on the aircraft. Units with active air defense commitments may waive the use of
intercom during alert scrambles. When ground intercom is not used, use visual signals IAW AFI
11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, and this instruction. All signals
pertaining to operation of aircraft systems will originate with the pilot. The crew chief will repeat
the given signals when it is safe to operate the system. The pilot should not activate any system
that could pose danger to the ground crew prior to receiving proper acknowledgment from
ground personnel. The following signals augment AFI 11-218:
   3.2.1. Integrated Power Package (IPP) START. With clenched fist, pilot makes a pulling
   motion;
   3.2.2. FLIGHT CONTROLS CLEAR. Raise arm, clench fist, and make a stirring action;
   3.2.3. REFUELING RECEPTACLE OPEN or CLOSED. Display hand flat on top of
   helmet with fingers extended. To open, raise fingers to the vertical position and heel of hand
   remaining stationary. To close, reverse signal;
   3.2.4. WEAPONS BAY OPEN or CLOSE. Display hands with fingers extended, palms
   up and edges of hands touching. Move hands apart several times;
   3.2.5. BRAKE CHECK. Hold left or right arm horizontal, open hand and push forward,
   breaking at the wrist (as in applying rudder pedal pressure with feet);
   3.2.6. LOSS OF BRAKES WHILE TAXIING. Lower tail hook; and,
   3.2.7. GUN ARMAMENT CHECK. Point index finger forward with thumb upward
   simulating a pistol and shake head (yes or no).
3.3. Engine Start.
   3.3.1. Stow loose items prior to starting the engine with the canopy open.
   3.3.2. Ice FOD Procedures. The following procedures will be followed when FSD
   indicates engine damage due to icing is possible:
       3.3.2.1. If conditions warrant, the Supervisor of Flying (SOF)/Top 3 will have the first
       flight lead start 5 minutes early to check for inlet ice formation;
 12                                                             AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012


       3.3.2.2. An ice FOD monitor must be available to monitor the engine inlets for ice
       buildup whenever the aircraft is stopped for an extended period of time (i.e. ramp/shelter
       and end of runway (EOR)). Avoid standing water and snow/slush accumulations;
       3.3.2.3. Hold in the arming spot with an ice FOD monitor present until cleared for
       takeoff; and,
       3.3.2.4. Shutdown immediately if icing is visually detected and notify the SOF/Top 3.
       Make an appropriate entry in the portable maintenance aid (PMA) and qualified
       personnel must accomplish an intake inspection prior to restarting the engine.
3.4. Taxi and Arming.
   3.4.1. The minimum taxi interval is 150 feet staggered or 300 feet in trail. Spacing may be
   reduced when holding short of or entering the runway. Limit taxi speed to 30 knots and 10
   knots in turns. Consider increasing taxi spacing when preceding aircraft engine exhaust may
   be ingested by On Board Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS).
   3.4.2. Do not taxi during snow and/or icy conditions until the taxi route and runway have
   been checked for safe conditions. In this case, taxi on the centerline with a minimum of 300
   feet spacing.
   3.4.3. Keep hands in view of ground personnel during quick check, arming or de-arming
   operations, especially if weapons bay doors (WBDs) will be actuated. If the intercom system
   is not used during EOR checks, the pilot will establish and maintain visual contact with the
   ground personnel to allow the use of visual signals.
   3.4.4. Do not taxi in front of aircraft being armed/de-armed with forward firing ordnance.
   3.4.5. Make every attempt to coordinate an EOR inspection with the host maintenance unit
   when not at home station, or at a non-USAF base.
3.5. Flight Lineup. Flights will line up as appropriate based on weather conditions, runway
conditions, and runway width. Use a minimum of 500 feet spacing between separated elements/
flights. If runway width precludes line-up with wingtip clearance between all aircraft in the
flight, use 500 feet spacing between elements or delay run-up until the preceding aircraft/element
releases brakes.
   3.5.1. Just prior to takeoff, all flight members will inspect each other for proper
   configuration and any abnormalities.
3.6. Takeoff.
   3.6.1. Do not takeoff if the runway condition reading (RCR) is less than FSD minimum
   allowable RCR.
   3.6.2. On training missions do not takeoff if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80 percent of
   the available runway. Takeoff using afterburner if the computed military power takeoff
   distance exceeds one-half of the available runway.
   3.6.3. When operating from airfields equipped with a compatible, remotely operated cable,
   ensure the departure end cable is raised for all takeoffs and landings, unless another departure
   end cable is in place.
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                        13


   3.6.4. Due to high engine turbulence during takeoff roll use a minimum of 15 seconds (20
   seconds when using afterburner) takeoff interval between aircraft. When carrying live air-to-
   ground (A/G) ordnance or executing sensor trail departures use 20 seconds takeoff interval.
   3.6.5. Aircraft will steer toward the center of the runway at the start of the takeoff roll.
   3.6.6. During rolling takeoffs, align the aircraft with the runway heading prior to advancing
   the throttle.
   3.6.7. Wing/OG Commanders may approve intersection takeoffs if operational requirements
   dictate.
3.7. Formation Takeoff. Prohibited, pending completion of Developmental Test and
Evaluation.
3.8. Join-up/Rejoin.
   3.8.1. Day weather criteria for a visual flight rules (VFR) join-up underneath: ceiling 1,500
   feet and visibility 3 miles.
   3.8.2. Flight leaders will maintain 300-350 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) until join-up is
   accomplished unless mission requirements or noise abatement procedures necessitate a
   different airspeed.
   3.8.3. Flight leaders should limit angle of bank to 30 degrees for turning rejoins immediately
   after takeoff.
   3.8.4. Flight members will join in sequence. For a straight-ahead rejoin, the number two
   aircraft will join on the left wing and the second element will join on the right wing. For a
   turning rejoin, the number two aircraft will rejoin on the inside of the turn and the element to
   the outside. If mission or flight requirements dictate, the flight leader will specifically direct
   the desired formation positions.
   3.8.5. Accomplish air-to-air systems checks above 10,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) when
   practical. Maintain "see and avoid" throughout all phases of flight.
   3.8.6. When circumstances permit, flight leads will direct a battle damage check after each
   mission prior to or during return to base (RTB). Except at night/ instrument meteorological
   conditions (IMC), this check is mandatory following the expenditure of any ordnance
   (including all types of 25 millimeter (mm) ammunition). Brief deconfliction responsibilities
   and position change procedures. Fly no closer than close formation spacing. Ensure all doors
   closed prior to landing.
   3.8.7. For further join-up procedures, see Night Procedures (3.18) and Chapter 4.
3.9. Formation, Visual and Administrative. Instructor pilots (IP)/flight leads are responsible
for ensuring contracts, roles and responsibilities of each flight member are established, briefed,
executed and debriefed. If any flight member cannot fulfill their basic responsibilities, contracts,
or other assigned tasks, they will immediately communicate that information to the flight/
element lead. IP/flight leads will task element leads/wingmen based on their ability to fulfill
basic responsibilities and other assigned tasks. For additional formation considerations, reference
Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (Inter-service) (AFTTP(I)) 3-3.F-35, Combat
Aircraft Fundamentals--F-35 and AFTTP 3-1.F-35, Tactical Employment--F-35A.
14                                                              AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012


  3.9.1. In IMC, the maximum flight size in close/route formation is four aircraft except when
  flying in close formation with a tanker.
  3.9.2. Do not use rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain formation position below 5,000
  feet above ground level (AGL) or in airspace where aerobatics are prohibited.
  3.9.3. Airborne visual signals will be in accordance with AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and
  Formation Flight Signals. For four-ship flights, configuration changes will be initiated by
  radio call, when practical.
  3.9.4. For non-tactical portions of a sortie (i.e. navigation to/from airspace) flight leaders
  will not break up formations until each wingman has a fix from which to navigate (visual,
  radar, operational GPS, inertial navigation system (INS), received tactical air navigation
  (TACAN) or received instrument landing system (ILS) in the appropriate steering mode).
  3.9.5. Changing Leads. Use the following procedures when changing the formation leader:
     3.9.5.1. When flying in limited visibility conditions, initiate lead changes from a
     stabilized, wings level attitude. When formation position changes are directed by radio,
     all wingmen will acknowledge prior to initiating the change. A radio call is mandatory
     when directing position changes at night or under instrument conditions;
     3.9.5.2. The minimum altitude for a lead change is 500 feet AGL or 1,000 feet AGL over
     water (for night see paragraph 3.18);
     3.9.5.3. Do not initiate lead changes (unless in close or route) with the wingman further
     aft than 30 degrees from line abreast;
     3.9.5.4. Flight/element leads will not initiate a lead change from a visual formation
     unless the aircraft assuming the lead is in visual contact and in a safe position to do so;
     3.9.5.5. Initiate a lead change by visual signal or radio call;
     3.9.5.6. Acknowledge receipt of the lead by head nod or radio call, as appropriate;
     3.9.5.7. A lead change is effective upon acknowledgment; and,
     3.9.5.8. The former leader then moves to the appropriate wing position.
  3.9.6. Visual Formation Maneuvering.
     3.9.6.1. Flight/element leads will consider wingman/element position and ability to
     safely perform a maneuver before directing it from a visual formation.
     3.9.6.2. Wingmen/elements must maneuver relative to the flight lead/lead element and
     maintain sight. Trailing aircraft/elements are responsible for deconfliction with lead
     aircraft/elements.
     3.9.6.3. Wingmen/elements will cross above the lead/lead element when deconfliction is
     required in the low altitude environment.
     3.9.6.4. Loss of Visual. Use the following procedures when one or more flight
     members/ elements lose visual contact while flying a visual formation:
         3.9.6.4.1. When the flight member currently responsible for visual deconfliction goes
         Blind, that flight member will call "Blind" with an altitude (“Gorilla 12, blind, 14.0”).
         If the other flight member (in this case, Gorilla 11), is visual with the blind aircraft,
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                       15


          that flight member will transmit the following; “Gorilla 12, Gorilla 11, right 2, 2
          miles, high.” If unable to provide a visual point-out, Gorilla 11 will ensure altitude
          deconfliction for the element/flight;
          3.9.6.4.2. When the other flight member/element is also "Blind," (in this case, Gorilla
          11), that pilot will immediately deconflict from the altitude called and will transmit
          own altitude as an immediate action to deconflict flight paths. The flight lead will
          ensure a minimum of 1,000 feet altitude separation is maintained. Avoid
          climbs/descents through the deconfliction altitude;
          3.9.6.4.3. When there is not a timely acknowledgment of the original "Blind" call,
          then the flight member/element initiating the call will maneuver away from the last
          known position of the other flight member/element and alter altitude;
          3.9.6.4.4. If visual contact is still not regained, the flight leader will take additional
          positive action to ensure flight path deconfliction within the flight to include a
          Terminate/Knock-It-Off (KIO) call if necessary. Consider scenario restrictions such
          as sanctuary altitudes and/or adversary blocks; and,
          3.9.6.4.5. Aircraft will maintain altitude separation until a visual is regained and, if
          necessary, will navigate with this altitude separation to ensure positive deconfliction
          between aircraft.
      3.9.6.5. Two-Ship Visual Formation Deconfliction. The following rules apply for
      flight path deconfliction in 2-ship visual formations:
          3.9.6.5.1. Normally, the wingman is responsible for flight path deconfliction.
          3.9.6.5.2. The flight lead becomes responsible for deconfliction when:
             3.9.6.5.2.1. Maneuvering places the leader well aft of the wingman’s 3/9 line or
             forces the wingman’s primary attention away from the leader;
             3.9.6.5.2.2. The wingman calls "blind;" and,
             3.9.6.5.2.3. Primary deconfliction responsibility transfers back to the wingman
             once the wingman acknowledges a visual on lead.
      3.9.6.6. Three/Four-Ship (or greater) Visual Formation Deconfliction. When flights
      of more than two aircraft are in visual formation:
          3.9.6.6.1. Formation visual signals performed by a flight/element leader pertain only
          to the associated element unless specified otherwise by the flight leader; and,
          3.9.6.6.2. Trailing aircraft/element(s) will maintain sufficient spacing so that primary
          emphasis during formation maneuvering/turns is on deconfliction within elements,
          not on deconfliction between elements.
3.10. Tactical Formation. Reference AFTTP(I) 3-3.F-35/AFTTP 3-1.F-35 for tactical
formation deconfliction and flight-member responsibilities.
3.11. Chase Formation.
   3.11.1. Restrictions. Any pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft under emergency or
   impending emergency conditions. Qualified pilots (including initial qualification training
 16                                                            AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012


   (IQT)/mission qualification training (MQT) pilots who have successfully completed an
   Instrument/Qualification evaluation) may chase as safety observer for aircraft performing
   simulated instrument flight or hung ordnance patterns. Specialized missions (i.e., test and
   evaluation, Weapon System Evaluation Program, live weapons delivery, etc.) and training
   conducted IAW AFI 11-2F-35AV1, may be chased by combat mission ready (CMR)/ basic
   mission capable (BMC) pilots designated by OG/ SQ/CCs. All other chase events may only
   be flown by IPs/flight examiners (FE) or upgrading IPs under the supervision of an IP.
   3.11.2. Procedures.
       3.11.2.1. A safety observer in a chase aircraft, except IP/FE/specialized mission chase,
       will maneuver in a 30-60 degree cone with nose/tail clearance to 1,000 feet, to effectively
       clear and/or provide assistance.
       3.11.2.2. IP/FE/specialized mission aircraft will maneuver as necessary, but must
       maintain nose/tail separation until required to transition to close formation when deemed
       necessary by the IP/FE.
       3.11.2.3. No chase aircraft will stack lower than lead aircraft when below 1,000 feet
       AGL.
       3.11.2.4. For live ordnance missions, the chase pilot is responsible for maintaining own-
       ship frag deconfliction.
3.12. Aerial Demonstrations. Brief and fly show formations as approved. Refer to AFI 11-209,
Aerial Event Policy and Procedures, and applicable MAJCOM directives for specific rules and
approval levels to participate in static displays and aerial events.
3.13. Maneuvering Parameters. Ref AFTTP(I) 3-3.F-35.
   3.13.1. Avoid flight through wingtip vortices and jet wash. If it is unavoidable, immediately
   unload the aircraft to approximately 1 G.
   3.13.2. The minimum airspeed for all maneuvering is based upon activation of the low speed
   warning tone. When the low speed warning tone sounds, the pilot will take action to correct
   the low speed condition.
   3.13.3. Advanced        Handling         Characteristics      (AHC)/Maneuvering
   Parameters. Reference AFTTP 3-3.F-35 for AHC maneuvering parameters.
   3.13.4. For aerobatics, remain above 5,000 feet AGL minimum. During vertical
   maneuvering (i.e., basic fighter maneuvers (BFM)) ensure maneuvers are terminated to allow
   recovery above 5,000 feet AGL minimum.
3.14. Ops Checks.
   3.14.1. Accomplish sufficient ops checks to ensure safe mission accomplishment. Ops
   checks are required:
       3.14.1.1. During climb or at level off after takeoff;
       3.14.1.2. Prior to each dissimilar air combat training ((D)ACBT) engagement or
       intercept; and,
       3.14.1.3. Following air refueling.
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                      17


   3.14.2. Minimum items to check are Integrated Caution and Warning System (ICAWS)
   messages, total fuel, G-suit connection, oxygen system, cabin altitude and max-G indicator.
   3.14.3. For formation flights, the flight leader may initiate ops checks by radio call or visual
   signal and wingmen will respond appropriately. The query and response for ops checks will
   include total fuel amount as read on the fuel Function Access Button (FAB). If wingmen are
   within 500 lbs. of the flight lead, a "same" call may be used.
      3.14.3.1. Do not substitute data-link fuel status for operational checks.
   3.14.4. G-awareness Exercise. Reference AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and
   Procedures, and AFTTP(I) 3-3.F-35. Unless performing a syllabus required event (e.g.,
   chase of a G-awareness exercise), flight members will maintain a minimum of 6,000 feet
   separation between aircraft during the execution of all G-awareness exercises. On board
   systems (e.g. air-to-air TACAN, radar, multi-waveform advanced data link (MADL)) should
   be used to establish separation prior to maneuver execution. During maneuver execution use
   visual lookout and briefed formation contracts as primary means of ensuring aircraft
   deconfliction. If required, use on board systems to enhance situational awareness during the
   maneuver.
      3.14.4.1. Flight/element leads will ensure the airspace intended for conducting the G-
      awareness exercise is free from potential traffic conflicts. Use Air Traffic Control (ATC)
      services to the maximum extent practical to make sure the airspace is clear. Conduct the
      G-awareness exercise in the following airspace with preference to the order as listed:
          3.14.4.1.1. Special Use Airspace (e.g. Restricted/Warning areas, ATC assigned
          airspace, Military Operating Areas and MAJCOM approved large scale
          exercise/special mission areas);
          3.14.4.1.2. Above 10,000 MSL outside of Special Use Airspace;
          3.14.4.1.3. Inside the confines of a Military Training Route; or,
          3.14.4.1.4. Below 10,000 feet MSL outside of Special Use Airspace.
      3.14.4.2. Flight/element leads flying OCONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM, Theater
      or Host Nation guidance on airspace in which G-awareness exercises may be performed.
      If no gaining MAJCOM, Theater, or Host Nation guidance is available, follow the
      guidance in paragraph 3.14.4.1 to the maximum extent practical.
      3.14.4.3. Film the G-awareness exercise in Hot Mic.
   3.14.5. AGSM awareness. Fly the tactical portion of all missions, especially basic skills
   missions (BFM, etc.) in Hot Mic to enable assessment of the AGSM.
3.15. Radio Procedures.
   3.15.1. Preface all communications with the complete flight call sign unless excepted below.
   Transmit only that information essential for mission accomplishment or safe flight. Use
   visual signals when practical.
   3.15.2. IAW AFTTP(I) 3-3.F-35, refer to the radios in the following manner:
      3.15.2.1. Comm A is Alpha. Alpha is assumed. Example: "Lightning Push 4."
 18                                                            AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012


      3.15.2.2. Comm B is Bravo. Example: "Lightning Push 4 Bravo."
      3.15.2.3. Comm C is Charlie. Example: "Lightning Push 238.8 Charlie."
   3.15.3. Acknowledge radio checks that do not require the transmission of specific data by
   individual flight members in turn (Example: "2, 3, 4"). Acknowledgment indicates the
   appropriate action is complete, in the process of being completed, or the flight member
   understands.
   3.15.4. In addition to the radio procedures outlined in AFI 11-202V3, specific mission
   guides, and FLIP publications, the following radio transmissions are required:
      3.15.4.1. All flight members will acknowledge understanding the initial ATC clearance.
      Acknowledge subsequent ATC instructions when directed by the flight lead, or anytime
      during trail departures as detailed in paragraph 4.3; and,
      3.15.4.2. Each pilot will report "gear down" to the ATC agency or runway supervisory
      unit after extending the landing gear. This report shall be made during any approach to an
      airport prior to crossing the runway threshold. A wingman or chase need not make this
      call during a formation or chased approach.
3.16. General Low Altitude Procedures.
   3.16.1. Fly low level formation positions/tactics using AFTTP 3-1.F-35 and AFTTP(I) 3-
   3.F-35 as guides.
   3.16.2. Spread formation is authorized at or above 500 feet AGL.
   3.16.3. During briefings emphasize low altitude flight maneuvering and observation of
   terrain features/obstacles in the low altitude training area. For low altitude training over
   water/ featureless terrain, include specific considerations with emphasis on minimum
   altitudes and spatial disorientation.
   3.16.4. All obstacle avoidance planning for low altitude map requirements will be IAW
   AFMAN 11-217V2. If unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral separation from known
   vertical obstructions which are a factor to the route of flight, flight leads will immediately
   direct a climb no later than (NLT) 3 nautical miles (NM) prior to the obstacle to an altitude
   that ensures vertical separation.
   3.16.5. At altitudes below 1,000 feet AGL, wingmen will not fly at a lower AGL altitude
   than lead.
   3.16.6. When crossing high or hilly terrain maintain positive G and do not exceed
   approximately 120 degrees of bank. Maneuvering at less than 1G is limited to upright
   bunting maneuvers.
   3.16.7. Minimum airspeeds.
      3.16.7.1. Minimum airspeed for low level navigation is 300 KIAS.
      3.16.7.2. Minimum airspeed for Air Defense, Low/Slow visual identification (VID)
      procedures is 13 degrees angle of attack (AOA).
      3.16.7.3. Minimum airspeed during low altitude offensive or defensive maneuvering
      (below 5,000 feet AGL) is 350 KIAS.
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                     19


   3.16.8. Minimum Altitudes. The unit commander will determine and certify pilot's
   minimum altitude IAW AFI 11-2F-35AV1. Flight members participating in approved step-
   down training programs will comply with the requirements and restrictions of that program.
   The following minimum altitudes apply to low altitude training unless national rules or a
   training syllabus specifies higher altitudes:
       3.16.8.1. 500 feet AGL for low altitude (LOWAT) Category I qualified pilots. 300 feet
       AGL for LOWAT Category II qualified pilots. 100 feet AGL for LOWAT Category III
       qualified pilots;
       3.16.8.2. For night (non- Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System/Night Vision (EO
       DAS/NV)) or IMC operation, the minimum altitude is 1,000 feet above the highest
       obstacle within 5 NM of aircraft position;
   3.16.9. During all low altitude operations, the immediate reaction to task saturation, diverted
   attention, KIO, or emergencies is to climb to a pre-briefed safe altitude (minimum 1,000 feet
   AGL); and,
   3.16.10. Weather minimums for visual low level training are the higher of; unit regulations,
   national rules or 1,500 feet ceiling and 3 miles visibility for any area, whichever is higher.
3.17. Air Refueling.
   3.17.1. Pilots undergoing initial/recurrency training in air refueling will not refuel with a
   student boom operator (does not apply to KC-10). Pilots will inform boom operators when
   refueling from a particular tanker type (KC-10, KC-46 or KC-135) for the first time.
   3.17.2. Quick flow procedures are authorized and will be conducted IAW F-35A FSD and
   Allied Tactical Publication (ATP)-56(B), Air to Air Refuelling (and annexes).
3.18. Night Procedures.
   3.18.1. Night Lighting Requirements.
       3.18.1.1. Position lights. Only one position light (POSIT) on each wing is required.
       However, if each wing only has one light, they must be on opposite sides; one upper, one
       lower (ex: top left, bottom right). Substituting a formation light in lieu of a wingtip
       position light is not permitted.
       3.18.1.2. Landing/Taxi Light. The landing/taxi light must be operational prior to
       takeoff. The taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be visually cleared
       without the landing/taxi light.
       3.18.1.3. Strobe lights. One operational strobe light (STROB) is required for night
       operations (ground and air). The strobe lights can be turned DIM or OFF if it causes
       distraction to the pilot. If the strobe lights are turned off while outside operational
       airspace, then at least one aircraft within a standard formation must have POSIT switch in
       the FLASH setting. Position lights in the FLASH setting meet AFI 11-202V3
       requirements for anti-collision.
   3.18.2. Night Ground Operations.
       3.18.2.1. When ground personnel are working under the aircraft, select POSIT BRT
       STDY, STROB OFF (position lights 100%, steady, strobe lights off).
 20                                                              AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012


      3.18.2.2. Taxi on the taxiway centerline with a minimum of 300 feet spacing.
      3.18.2.3. Use the landing/taxi light while taxiing unless it might interfere with an aircraft
      landing or taking off. The taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be
      visually cleared without the landing/taxi light.
      3.18.2.4. For taxi, set POSIT BRT FLASH, STROB BRT.
   3.18.3. Night Takeoff. For takeoffs, set POSIT BRT FLASH, STROB BRT. Following
   takeoff, each aircraft/element will climb on runway heading to 1,000 feet AGL before
   initiating turns, except where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance.
   3.18.4. Night Join-up. Weather criteria for night join-up underneath is a ceiling of 3,000
   feet and 5 miles visibility. Flight Leads will direct lighting adjustments for the flight based on
   environmental conditions and flight member feedback.
   3.18.5. Night Formation Procedures.
      3.18.5.1. When in non-visual formations at night, maintain aircraft spacing primarily by
      instruments, sensors/MADL, and/or timing. If aircraft spacing cannot be ensured,
      establish altitude separation (1,000 feet minimum). Crosscheck to ensure terrain
      clearance.
      3.18.5.2. Do not change lead or wing formation positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless
      on radar downwind. Direct lead and position changes using the radio and from a
      stabilized, wings-level attitude.
      3.18.5.3. Night Formation Parameters. References and parameters for night formation
      positions are specified in AFTTP(I) 3-3.F-35.
   3.18.6. Night Break-up. Prior to a formation break-up at night, the flight leader will
   transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting, which will be acknowledged by
   wingmen. Wingmen will confirm their onboard systems required for independent night
   navigation are functional.
   3.18.7. Night Landing. Normally, all night landings will be from an instrument straight-in
   approach. Refer to AFI 11-202V3, for specific procedures.
3.19. Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System/Night Vision Procedures.
   3.19.1. Until AFTTP 3-1.F-35 and AFTTP(I) 3-3.F-35 incorporate expanded tactical
   guidance for EO DAS/NV, current guidance (including AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-214, and AFI
   11-2F-35V1) outlines the EO DAS/NV training program.
      3.19.1.1. Using the EO DAS/NV and the Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) for night
      operations the pilot may choose to display either a full 360 degree Distributed Aperture
      System (DAS) infrared video; or the near-infrared Night Vision Camera (NVC) reliant on
      lunar or cultural lighting.
      3.19.1.2. Flight leads will brief the appropriate time to initiate EO DAS/NV operations
      for the sortie. All flight members will make a radio call when switching to/from EO
      DAS/NV. Flight leads will call turns if forced to maneuver while flight members are
      switching to/from EO DAS/NV.
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                         21


     3.19.1.3. When operating in a visual formation outside of NV route formation, frequent
     crosscheck of horizon/instruments will be made to reduce possibility of spatial dis/mis-
     orientation.
     3.19.1.4. Flight Leads will brief the appropriate EO DAS/NV compatible formation
     lighting levels for each flight member to set.
  3.19.2. The HMD must be preflight tested and adjusted by the pilot prior to flight. EO
  DAS/NV operations will be off until at least 2,000 feet AGL in climbing or level flight.
  Cease EO DAS/NV operations no later than 5 minutes prior to landing, unless necessary to
  handle an emergency.
  3.19.3. With EO DAS/NV, pilots may operate below the route abort altitude (RAA)/
  minimum safe altitude (MSA) down to a minimum of 1,000 ft AGL during high-illumination
  periods (as defined by AFI 11-214). The flight lead or individual pilot is the final authority to
  assess actual illumination for a particular mission element, based on visibility and terrain
  features/resolution.
  3.19.4. EO DAS/NV may be used for night tanker rejoins, but will be deselected no later
  than the stern position.
  3.19.5. Unless required for aircraft assistance, wingmen using EO DAS/NV will fly no
  closer than route formation.
  3.19.6. EO DAS/NV Battle Damage Checks. If executed, fly no closer than parameters for
  route formation (as defined in AFTTP(I) 3-3.F-35).
  3.19.7. In-flight Emergencies. During in-flight emergencies, EO DAS/NV may be used to
  safely recover the aircraft.
  3.19.8. Abnormal Procedures.
     3.19.8.1. Lost sight. If you lose sight within a visual formation, execute appropriate lost
     wingman procedures. Consider highlighting position by increasing exterior lighting level,
     activating the afterburner, or deploying flares as airspace allows.
     3.19.8.2. EO DAS/NV failure. Ensure separation from other aircraft and the ground
     before attempting to remedy the failure:
         3.19.8.2.1. Transition to instruments;
         3.19.8.2.2. Perform lost wingman procedures if appropriate;
         3.19.8.2.3. Route abort/climb above MSA if appropriate;
         3.19.8.2.4. Terminate/KIO as applicable; and,
         3.19.8.2.5. If other aircraft are in the vicinity, direct them to raise their external lights
         to visible levels.
     3.19.8.3. Inadvertent flight into weather. Encountering poor weather conditions
     during EO DAS/ NV operations may cause loss of situation awareness (SA) and pilot
     distraction/disorientation.
         3.19.8.3.1. Single ship or separated from flight members:
             3.19.8.3.1.1. Transition to instruments;
 22                                                             AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012


              3.19.8.3.1.2. Route abort if low altitude, otherwise climb/descend to VMC; and,
              3.19.8.3.1.3. Terminate/KIO as applicable.
          3.19.8.3.2. Formation flight. If entering weather in formation or close proximity to
          other aircraft, perform the first five steps under EO DAS/NV failure (paragraph
          3.19.8.2), as appropriate, then climb/descend to attempt to regain VMC.
3.20. Fuel Requirements.
   3.20.1. Joker Fuel. Fuel state above BINGO at which separation/bugout/event termination
   should begin.
   3.20.2. Bingo Fuel. A pre-briefed fuel state that allows the aircraft to return to the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required, using preplanned recovery parameters and arriving
   with normal recovery fuel as listed below.
   3.20.3. Normal Recovery Fuel. The fuel on initial or at the final approach fix at the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required. Fuel quantity will be as established locally or 2,500
   pounds, whichever is higher.
   3.20.4. Declare the following when it becomes apparent that an aircraft may land at the
   intended destination or alternate, if required, with:
      3.20.4.1. Minimum Fuel. 1,800 pounds or less. This is based on 20 minutes reserve at
      10,000 feet MSL flying max endurance airspeed (fulfilling AFI 11-202V3 fuel reserve
      requirements); and,
      3.20.4.2. Emergency Fuel. 1,200 pounds or less.
3.21. Approaches and Landings.
   3.21.1. The desired touchdown point for a VFR approach is 500 to 1,000 feet from the
   threshold or the glide slope interception point for a precision approach. When local
   procedures or unique conditions require landing beyond the normal touchdown point, adjust
   the touchdown point accordingly.
   3.21.2. Minimum pattern and touchdown spacing between landing aircraft is 3,000 feet for
   similar aircraft (e.g., F-35A versus F-35A), 6,000 feet for dissimilar aircraft (e.g., F-35A
   versus F-16) or as directed by MAJCOM or the landing base, whichever is higher. Increase
   spacing whenever wake turbulence is anticipated. Increase landing separation to 9,000 feet
   when wind conditions increase the likelihood of encountering lead aircraft's wake turbulence.
   3.21.3. Normally, all aircraft will land in the center of the runway and clear to the turnoff
   (cold) side of the runway when speed/conditions permit.
   3.21.4. Landing Restrictions.
      3.21.4.1. When the computed landing roll exceeds 80 percent of the available runway,
      land at an alternate if possible.
      3.21.4.2. Do not land over any raised web barrier (e.g. BAK-15, MA-1A, 61QSII).
      3.21.4.3. When the RCR at the base of intended landing is less than minimum RCR
      allowed in the FSD, land at an alternate if possible. If an alternate is not available, an
      approach end or midfield arrestment is recommended.
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                     23


3.22. Overhead Traffic Patterns.
   3.22.1. Overhead patterns can be made with:
       3.22.1.1. Unexpended live ordnance (internal carriage only);
       3.22.1.2. Unexpended inert ordnance (internal or external);
       3.22.1.3. Any 25mm gun ammunition or flares; and,
       3.22.1.4. Does not apply to hung or misfired ordnance (secure or unsecure).
   3.22.2. Initiate the break over the touchdown point or as directed.
   3.22.3. Execute individual breaks in a level 180 degree turn to the downwind leg at
   minimum intervals of 5 seconds (except IP/FE chase or when in tactical formation).
   3.22.4. Plan to arrive wings level on final at approximately 300 feet AGL and 1 mile from
   the planned touchdown point.
   3.22.5. Do not operate beneath the ceiling, under VFR, within the lateral boundaries of
   controlled airspace for an airport when the ceiling is less than 1,000 feet.
3.23. Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns. Tactical entry to the overhead traffic pattern is
permitted when:
   3.23.1. The published overhead pattern altitude and airspeed are used;
   3.23.2. Specific procedures are developed and coordinated with appropriate air traffic
   control agencies;
   3.23.3. No more than four aircraft are in the flight. Aircraft/elements more than 6,000 feet in
   trail are considered a separate flight;
   3.23.4. No aircraft are offset from the runway in the direction of the break. The intent is to
   avoid requiring a tighter than normal turn to arrive on normal downwind; and,
   3.23.5. Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing are flown.
3.24. Touch-and-Go Landings.
   3.24.1. Fly touch-and-go landings IAW AFI 11-202V3. Multiple touch-and-go landings may
   be flown to regain landing currency.
   3.24.2. Do not fly touch-and-go landings with hung or live external ordnance.
3.25. Low Approaches.
   3.25.1. Observe the following minimum altitudes:
       3.25.1.1. Normal single ship low approaches - so that touchdown does not occur;
       3.25.1.2. IP/FE flying chase position - 50 feet AGL;
       3.25.1.3. Formation low approaches and non-IP/FE chase - 100 feet AGL; and,
       3.25.1.4. Chase aircraft during an emergency - 300 feet AGL unless safety or
       circumstances dictate otherwise.
 24                                                             AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012


   3.25.2. During go-around, remain 500 feet below VFR overhead traffic pattern altitude until
   crossing the departure end of the runway unless local procedures, missed approach/climb out
   procedures, or controller instructions dictate otherwise.
3.26. Closed Traffic Patterns. Initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway unless
directed/cleared otherwise by local procedures or the controlling agency. From a formation
approach or chase position, a sequential closed may be flown with ATC concurrence at an
interval to ensure proper spacing. Plan to arrive on downwind below 250 KIAS.
3.27. Formation Approaches.
   3.27.1. General.
       3.27.1.1. Normally accomplish formation approaches from a published instrument
       approach or a VFR straight-in approach using the visual approach slope indicator
       (VASI), if available. In all cases, use a rate of descent similar to a normal precision
       approach.
       3.27.1.2. Position the wingman on the upwind side if crosswind exceeds 5 knots.
       3.27.1.3. Formation approaches will not descend below 100 feet AGL.
   3.27.2. Formation Landings. Prohibited, pending completion of Developmental Test and
   Evaluation.
   3.27.3. Formation Drag Procedures.
       3.27.3.1. Formation drag approaches are restricted to:
          3.27.3.1.1. Day;
          3.27.3.1.2. Weather: 1,500 feet/3 miles; and,
          3.27.3.1.3. Formation: two-ship maximum.
       3.27.3.2. When directed to take spacing, wingmen will reduce power, extend speed
       brakes and slow to no less than 250 KIAS while achieving 1.5 to 2.5 NM spacing.
       3.27.3.3. Designate the preceding aircraft as Next-to-Shoot (NTS), call "tied," maintain
       briefed spacing and perform a single ship pattern/landing.
3.28. After Shutdown Procedures. All flight members will accomplish a post flight walk-
around. The intent of this inspection is to find evidence of bird strike, lost panels, damaged
ordnance, and structural damage resulting from over-Gs or other in-flight abnormalities.
3.29. Air-to-Air Interrogator (AAI), Identification Friend or Foe/Selective Identification
Feature (IFF/SIF). F-35 AAI use in the National Airspace System (NAS) will comply with the
following:
   3.29.1. Aircraft shall limit AAI training activities to approved Special Use Airspace (SUA),
   as defined by DoD Flight Information Publications AP/1, AP/1A, and AP/1B (i.e., Military
   Operations Areas, Warning Areas, Restricted areas, and Military Training Routes);
   3.29.2. Outside of SUA, pilots shall limit AAI interrogations to mission essential and safety
   of flight purposes. Pilots may perform an interrogator check momentarily on the ground
   and/or after take-off for system verification purposes.
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                       25


   3.29.3. Whenever possible, reduce interrogation to the minimum azimuth necessary to meet
   target identification requirements (i.e., point interrogate vs. using full capability of system);
   3.29.4. For operations within the United States and Possessions, each IFF mode will only be
   interrogated once during a set sequence. Additionally, do not utilize any scan multiplier
   greater than one; and,
   3.29.5. Only employ Mode 4 interrogations in areas where use of Mode 4 airborne
   interrogations have been specifically authorized by the National Telecommunications and
   Information Administration, and IAW with all conditions on the Mode 4 frequency transmit
   authority.

                                           Chapter 4

                               INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. Display of Endorsed Primary Flight Reference.
   4.1.1. Anytime flight conditions (illumination, visibility, weather) or procedures (National
   Airspace System) require flight by reference to instruments, the pilot MUST select and
   continuously display an endorsed primary flight reference (PFR). The Standby Flight Display
   (SFD) and Helmet Mounted Display are not endorsed PFRs. Currently approved single
   medium PFR displays are heads-down, either:
      4.1.1.1. Helmet Mounted Display Virtual Heads-Up Display (HMD v-HUD). Note that
      under some flight regimes, the horizon line and pitch ladder collides (coexists) with the
      airspeed, altitude and heading symbology, causing potential readability issues; or,
      4.1.1.2. Full-color Electronic Flight Instrument (EFI). When using this display, pilots are
      prohibited from using the pop-up data entry keypad overlaid on the EFI.
   4.1.2. The primary unusual attitude reference is the HMD v-HUD. Do not use the HMD or
   SFD to recover from an unusual attitude or when executing lost wingman procedures except
   when no other attitude reference is available.
4.2. Takeoff and Join-up.
   4.2.1. The flight lead must get an appropriate ATC clearance (altitude block or trail
   formation) when a flight join-up is not possible due to weather conditions or operational
   requirements. Formation trail departures must comply with instructions for a nonstandard
   formation flight as defined in FLIP. ATC will provide radar flight following for the entire
   formation.
   4.2.2. If weather is below 1,500 feet and 3 miles, each aircraft will climb on takeoff heading
   to 1,000 feet AGL minimum before initiating any turns, except when departure instructions
   specifically preclude compliance.
4.3. Trail Procedures.
   4.3.1. General.
      4.3.1.1. During trail formations, basic instrument flying is the first priority and must not
      be sacrificed when performing secondary trail tasks. Strictly adhere to the briefed
      airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings, and turn points. If task saturation occurs,
      cease attempts to maintain trail, concentrate on flying the instrument departure, and then
      notify the flight lead. The flight lead will then notify ATC.
      4.3.1.2. Flight leaders will request non-standard formation from ATC.
      4.3.1.3. ATC instructions issued to the lead aircraft apply to the entire flight.
      4.3.1.4. Flight leads will brief aircraft/element spacing. Minimum spacing between
      aircraft when in non-standard formation is 9,000 feet and will be maintained using on
      board systems.
      4.3.1.5. Limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank.
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                       27


     4.3.1.6. If a flight member is not a Shoot List Track or on MADL, each aircraft will
     follow the "No- Shoot List Track" procedure until the aircraft/element immediately in
     trail has established the preceding aircraft as the NTS and called "tied."
  4.3.2. Shoot List Track procedure.
     4.3.2.1. Each aircraft/element will call “tied” when a Shoot List Track is established with
     the preceding aircraft. Once all aircraft are tied, no further radio calls are required, unless
     contact is lost. Flight leads will ensure that wingman are aware of any unplanned or ATC
     directed intermediate level off altitudes.
     4.3.2.2. In flights of three or more aircraft, use all available aircraft systems (i.e., radar,
     MADL, TACAN, AAI, etc.) to ensure that trail is maintained on the correct aircraft.
  4.3.3. No-Shoot List Track procedure.
     4.3.3.1. The flight leader will call when initiating all turns. Subsequent aircraft must
     delay turns to maintain the desired spacing.
     4.3.3.2. Each aircraft/element will maintain 1.5-2.0 mile spacing using all available
     aircraft systems and navigational aids to monitor position.
     4.3.3.3. During climbs and descents, each aircraft/element will call passing each 5,000
     foot altitude increment with altitude and heading (or heading passing) until join-up, level-
     off or the following aircraft/element calls "tied."
     4.3.3.4. Each aircraft/element will call initiating any altitude or heading change.
     Acknowledgments are not required; however, it is imperative that preceding
     aircraft/elements monitor the radio transmissions and progress of the succeeding
     aircraft/elements and immediately correct deviations from the planned route.
     4.3.3.5. Each aircraft/element will maintain at least 1,000 feet vertical separation from
     the preceding aircraft/element until establishing radar/visual contact, except in instances
     where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. Reduce vertical separation
     to 500 feet if necessary to comply with minimum safe altitude restrictions.
     4.3.3.6. In the event a visual join-up cannot be accomplished on top or at level off, the
     flight leader will request altitude separation for each succeeding aircraft/element to meet
     the requirements of the above paragraph.
  4.3.4. Trail Departures.
     4.3.4.1. Use 20 seconds takeoff spacing.
     4.3.4.2. Each aircraft will accelerate in military (MIL)/afterburner (AB) power until
     reaching 350 KIAS. Climb at 350 KIAS until reaching cruise mach/KIAS, unless
     otherwise briefed.
     4.3.4.3. Upon reaching 350 KIAS, the flight leader will set and maintain 90% ETR
     unless otherwise briefed.
  4.3.5. Enroute Trail. Flight leads must brief airspeeds, power settings and configuration.
  4.3.6. Trail Recovery.
 28                                                                 AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012


       4.3.6.1. Trail recovery procedures must be coordinated and approved through the
       responsible ATC facilities and addressed in a local operating procedure or in the unit
       supplement to this volume. Trail recoveries will only be accomplished at home station,
       local diverts and deployed locations where procedures have been established and briefed.
       As a minimum, procedures must address each recovery profile, missed approach, climb
       out, lost contact, lost communications and desired/maximum spacing requirements.
       4.3.6.2. Limit trail recoveries to a maximum of four aircraft.
       4.3.6.3. Trail recoveries are authorized when weather at the base of intended landing is at
       or above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or approach minimums,
       whichever is higher.
       4.3.6.4. Trail recoveries will not terminate in simultaneous precision approach radar
       (PAR) or airport surveillance radar (ASR) approaches. Recoveries to separate PAR/ASRs
       are authorized, however, flights must split prior to PAR/ASR final.
       4.3.6.5. The flight lead must brief the flight on spacing, configuration and airspeeds.
       Minimum spacing between aircraft in IMC is 9,000 feet and will be maintained using
       sensors.
       4.3.6.6. Prior to taking spacing, the flight lead must coordinate the trail recovery with
       ATC and ensure all wingman have operational navigational aids and radar (or station
       keeping sensors).
           4.3.6.6.1. Accomplish the spacing maneuver in VMC to the max extent possible.
       4.3.6.7. The formation must squawk as directed by ATC. Regardless of flight position,
       the lead aircraft in the trail recovery will squawk the ATC issued Mode 3 code. ATC
       instructions to the lead aircraft will be for the entire flight.
       4.3.6.8. Once established on a segment of a published approach, each aircraft must
       comply with all published altitudes and restrictions while maintaining trail separation.
       4.3.6.9. Unless local procedures establish defined reference points for airspeed/
       configuration changes, the flight lead will direct changes by radio. At flight lead's call, all
       aircraft must simultaneously comply with the directed change.
       4.3.6.10. All aircraft will report the final approach fix.
       4.3.6.11. If contact is lost with the preceding aircraft, the pilot will transmit "(Callsign)
       lost contact." The preceding aircraft will respond with altitude, airspeed and heading.
       Establish altitude deconfliction and coordinate a separate clearance with ATC. If contact
       is lost while established on a segment of a published approach, flight members may
       continue the approach, but must confirm separation via navigation aids. If separation
       cannot be confirmed, execute missed approach or climb out as instructed by ATC.
4.4. Formation Break-up. Formation break-up from a visual formation will occur in VMC. If
IMC is unavoidable, breakup from a visual formation will occur in straight and level flight. This
restriction does not apply to trail formation. Prior to an IMC break-up, the flight leader must
transmit attitude, airspeed, altitude, and altimeter setting which will be acknowledged by
wingmen. Flight leaders will confirm (and wingmen will acknowledge) that all flight members
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                        29


have the ability to navigate independently, and sufficient navigation systems to land (operable
GPS/INS, and/or reception of appropriate TACAN/ILS).
4.5. Formation Penetration.
   4.5.1. Restrict formation penetrations in route/close formation to two aircraft when the
   weather at the base of intended landing is less than overhead traffic pattern minimums.
   4.5.2. Formation penetrations using sensor trail procedures are authorized when weather at
   the base of intended landing is at/above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or
   approach minimums, whichever is higher.
4.6. Formation Approach. Stack level with gear down when in the clear, below the weather.
4.7. Instrument Approach.
   4.7.1. Pilots will not fly any published instrument approach procedure (e.g. DoD, Jeppesen)
   that requires airspeeds less than those specified in the FSD.
   4.7.2. The F-35A is Approach Category E. Accomplish missed approach IAW FSD
   procedures. Missed approach airspeed is 250 KIAS.
   4.7.3. Only use actual approach Category D minimums in IMC at an emergency or divert
   airfield where no Category E minimums are published. Practice Cat D approaches may be
   accomplished in VMC. In both cases, pilots must also comply with the following restrictions:
       4.7.3.1. A straight-in approach is flown;
       4.7.3.2. For the final approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 165 KIAS or less; and,
       4.7.3.3. For the missed approach segment, fly at 255 knots true airspeed (KTAS) or less.
       Any time 255 KTAS requires a KIAS below the speed specified in F-35 FSD; Category
       D approaches shall not be flown.
   4.7.4. Do not fly area navigation (RNAV) or GPS approaches. The F-35A is not approved
   for RNAV approaches.
4.8. Simulated Instrument Flight.
   4.8.1. Restrictions. Follow the simulated instrument flight restrictions defined in AFI 11-
   202V3.
4.9. Flight into Known Icing Conditions. Prohibited, pending completion of Developmental
Test and Evaluation.

6.7. Target Identification. Pilots will positively identify the target prior to weapons release.
Pilots will confirm the proper coordinates, elevation, and weapons data is loaded in the steer
point for their assigned target(s) and that these values match the desired point of impact for A/G
weapons. Pilots will ensure they completely understand how coordinates and elevation for their
target(s) were generated and that use of this data is in compliance with all range procedures,
training rules or rules of engagement. For training sorties, achieve positive identification by
either visually acquiring the target or by confirming target location through valid on-board/off-
board cues. Cues may include, but are not limited to, radar, GPS, marking rounds, Electro-
Optical Targeting System track, infrared pointers or NV-compatible marking devices. Exercise
caution when relying on a single cue to confirm target location.
6.8. Live Ordnance Procedures. When carrying live air-to-ground munitions:
   6.8.1. Refer to AFI 11-214;
   6.8.2. Do not make simulated weapons delivery passes on manned targets with live air-to-
   ground munitions loaded on the aircraft; and,
   6.8.3. When ground controllers are on class B/C ranges the following procedures apply:
       6.8.3.1. All pilots will be familiar with applicable range weapons delivery procedures,
       appropriate targets and weapons footprints;
       6.8.3.2. Ground personnel locations will be briefed and acknowledged by all pilots; and,
       6.8.3.3. Pilots will not expend ordnance if any doubt exists as to the ground personnel or
       intended target locations.
6.9. Flare Employment.
   6.9.1. Due to metal nose cap debris and risk to ground personnel, employment of MJU-68 or
   MJU-69 flares is restricted to airspace over an authorized munitions impact area.
   6.9.2. Employment of any training flare, MJU-61 or equivalent, will comply with current
   airspace restrictions for flare employment.
   6.9.3. Flares will not be deployed with a pursuing aircraft within 10 degrees of tail and 2,000
   feet or less range to minimize potential for flare ingestion by attacking aircraft.
6.10. Night Weapons Delivery/Range Operations. All procedures in AFI 11-214 apply.
6.11. Night Altitudes. Compute an MSA for the entire pattern using the IFR Off Airways
guidance in AFI 11-202V3 Chapter 8. The minimum altitude for night High Angle Strafe (HAS)
is the Target MSA (as defined in Attachment 1) unless executed by an NV-low qualified pilot
(as defined in AFI 11-2F-35AV1) under high-illumination conditions (as defined in AFI 11-214).
6.12. Night Bank Angle. Do not exceed 135 degrees of bank when returning to the low altitude
structure (below 5,000 feet AGL).

                                            Chapter 7

                        ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

7.1. General. These procedures do not supersede F-35A FSD guidance.
   7.1.1. Do not accept an aircraft for flight with a safety of flight malfunction addressed in the
   emergency/abnormal procedure section of F-35A FSD until it has been corrected.
   7.1.2. Do not use a malfunctioning system unless it is required for safe recovery of the
   aircraft. Do not continue in-flight troubleshooting a malfunction after completing F-35A FSD
   emergency procedures and the aircraft may be safely recovered.
   7.1.3. Unless authorized by FSD and local procedures, do not taxi the aircraft with nose
   wheel steering or brake malfunctions.
   7.1.4. For actual or perceived flight control malfunctions, terminate maneuvering and take
   appropriate action.
7.2. Ground Aborts.
   7.2.1. If a flight member aborts prior to takeoff, the flight leader will normally renumber the
   flight. Flight leaders must advise the appropriate agencies of such changes.
   7.2.2. In the event of an abort, formation flight may only continue if it is led by a qualified
   flight lead. The alternatives are a sympathetic abort or proceeding on a pre-briefed single-
   ship mission.
   7.2.3. Delayed aircraft may join the flight at a briefed rendezvous point or may fly a briefed
   alternate single ship mission. If accomplishing a join-up, cease tactical maneuvering until the
   delayed aircraft is joined and all flight members are ready to continue.
7.3. Takeoff Aborts.
   7.3.1. If an abort occurs during takeoff roll, notify tower and flight members with call sign
   and intentions when practical. Following aircraft will alter takeoff roll to ensure clearance or
   abort takeoff if adequate clearance cannot be maintained. The phrase "Cable, Cable, Cable"
   will be used to indicate a departure-end cable arrestment. The phrase "Barrier, Barrier,
   Barrier" will be used to indicate a departure-end net arrestment. Local procedures will
   address net barrier raising procedures.
   7.3.2. Reference FSD for speeds above which hot brakes are probable and associated hot
   brake procedures. If hot brakes are suspected; declare a ground emergency, taxi the aircraft to
   the designated hot brake area, and follow hot brake procedures.
   7.3.3. If aborting a takeoff, lower the tail hook if there is any doubt about the ability to stop
   on the runway.
7.4. Air Aborts.
   7.4.1. If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original numerical call
   sign.
   7.4.2. Escort aborting aircraft with an emergency to the field of intended landing. In other
   cases, the flight leader will determine if an escort is required.
 34                                                            AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012


   7.4.3. Abort the mission and land out of a straight-in approach, regardless of apparent
   damage or subsequent normal operation, for any of the following:
       7.4.3.1. ICAWs or emergencies requiring flight in the FSD defined optimum Cooling
       Envelope;
       7.4.3.2. Bird strike/Foreign Object Damage;
       7.4.3.3. Flight control system anomalies. This does not include flight control system
       ICAWS that reset IAW FSD procedures;
       7.4.3.4. Engine anomalies or Engine related ICAWS that do not clear IAW FSD
       guidance; and,
       7.4.3.5. OBOGS malfunction.
   7.4.4. If an aircraft experiences an over-G, use the following procedures:
       7.4.4.1. Terminate the mission and land as soon as practical from a straight-in approach;
       7.4.4.2. Perform a battle damage check; and,
       7.4.4.3. Document over-G in the PMA after flight.
7.5. Engine Malfunctions. Report all engine anomalies during maintenance debriefing.
7.6. Radio Failure.
   7.6.1. General. Individual aircraft experiencing radio failure will comply with procedures
   outlined in FLIP, AFI 11-202V3, this instruction and local directives.
   7.6.2. Formation.
       7.6.2.1. Flight members who experience total radio failure while in close or route
       formation will maneuver within close/route parameters to attract the attention of another
       flight member and give the appropriate visual signals. Terminate the mission as soon as
       practical and lead the NORDO aircraft to the base of intended landing or a divert base (if
       required). Perform a formation approach to a drop-off on final unless safety
       considerations dictate otherwise.
       7.6.2.2. If flying other than close/route formation when radio failure occurs, the NORDO
       aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position at approximately 500 feet on another
       flight member. The NORDO aircraft is responsible for maintaining clearances from other
       flight members until his presence is acknowledged by a wing rock, signifying clearance
       to join. Once joined, the NORDO aircraft will give the appropriate visual signals. If pre-
       briefed, the NORDO aircraft may proceed to a rendezvous point and hold. If no one has
       rejoined prior to reaching JOKER fuel, the NORDO aircraft should proceed to the base of
       intended landing or a divert base. Aircraft experiencing any difficulty/emergency in
       addition to NORDO will proceed as required by the situation.
   7.6.3. NORDO on a Class A Range or a Manned Class B Range.
       7.6.3.1. Attempt contact with the RCO on the appropriate back-up frequency or back up
       radios.
       7.6.3.2. If contact cannot be reestablished, make a pass by the range control tower on the
       attack heading while rocking wings and turn in the direction of traffic. The flight lead
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                    35


     will direct another flight member to escort the NORDO to a recovery base or rejoin the
     flight and RTB.
     7.6.3.3. If the NORDO aircraft has an emergency, make a pass by the range control
     tower, if practical, on the attack heading while rocking wings, turn opposite the direction
     of traffic, and proceed to a recovery base. The flight lead will direct a flight member to
     join-up and escort the emergency aircraft.
  7.6.4. NORDO on an Unmanned Class B Range or on a Class C Range.
     7.6.4.1. Make a pass on the target maintaining normal pattern spacing, if possible, while
     rocking wings. The flight lead will direct another flight member to escort the NORDO
     aircraft to a recovery base or rejoin the flight in sequence and recover. If the NORDO
     aircraft has an emergency, if practical, it will make a pass on the target maintaining
     normal pattern spacing, rocking wings, turn opposite direction of traffic and proceed to a
     recovery base. The flight lead will direct a flight member to join-up and escort the
     emergency aircraft.
     7.6.4.2. Unexpended Ordnance. If radio failure occurs and circumstances preclude
     landing with unexpended ordnance, safe jettison of ordnance may be accomplished
     provided the following conditions are met:
     7.6.4.3. The NORDO aircraft joins on another flight member who has radio contact with
     the range control officer and the remainder of the flight; and,
     7.6.4.4. Stores jettison visual signals specified in AFI 11-205 are relayed to the NORDO
     aircraft to initiate jettison.
  7.6.5. Aerial Gunnery/Missile Firing NORDO Procedures.
     7.6.5.1. Aircraft will not fire without two-way radio contact.
     7.6.5.2. Shooting aircraft: safe the armament switches, join on another member of the
     flight or the tow aircraft, IAW paragraph 7.6.2.
     7.6.5.3. Tow aircraft rocks wings and continue the turn if an attack is in progress. The
     flight leader of the attacking aircraft will "knock off" the attack and join on the tow's
     wing, remaining clear of the target in the event it is cut. The tow pilot will use standard
     hand signals to indicate his difficulty. The flight leader will signal when the target is
     cleared for cut with a slicing motion across the throat. After the target is away and the
     flight lead determines there is no remaining cable, the tow aircraft will RTB with an
     escort following the briefed NORDO recovery procedures. If cable remains, follow local
     procedures.
  7.6.6. NORDO Recovery.
     7.6.6.1. Apply the procedures in AFI 11-205 and FLIP.
     7.6.6.2. If a formation straight-in approach is flown and a go-around becomes necessary,
     the chase will go-around, pass the NORDO aircraft and rock his wings. The NORDO
     aircraft will go-around, if the situation allows. If the NORDO aircraft is in formation as a
     wingman, the leader will initiate a gentle turn into the wingman and begin the go-around.
 36                                                               AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012


       7.6.6.3. A NORDO aircraft intending to make an approach-end cable engagement will
       signal the escorting aircraft by extending the tail hook. If the NORDO aircraft is not
       escorted, the pilot will fly a straight-in approach flashing the landing/taxi light on final to
       signal the tower.
7.7. Severe Weather Penetration. Avoid flight through severe weather. If unavoidable, flights
should break-up and obtain separate clearances prior to severe weather penetration. Set airspeed
to F-35A FSD penetration airspeed for flight through rain or thunderstorms.
7.8. Lost Wingman Procedures. In any lost wingman situation, immediate separation of
aircraft is essential. Refer to paragraph 7.9 for specific spatial disorientation (SD) considerations.
Smooth application of control inputs is imperative to minimize the effects of SD.
   7.8.1. Upon losing sight of the leader or if unable to maintain formation, the wingman will
   execute the applicable lost wingman procedures, simultaneously:
       7.8.1.1. Transition to primary flight instruments;
       7.8.1.2. Inform lead by transmitting "(Callsign) is lost wingman;"
       7.8.1.3. After executing a lost wingman procedure, do not attempt rejoining with the
       flight until obtaining permission from the flight lead;
       7.8.1.4. When able, obtain a separate clearance; and,
       7.8.1.5. Observe all published terrain clearance limits.
   7.8.2. Two or Three-Ship Flights (three-ship echelon, refer to four-ship procedures).
       7.8.2.1. Wings-level flight (climbing, descending, or straight and level). Turn away
       using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds, then resume original heading.
       7.8.2.2. Turns.
           7.8.2.2.1. Outside the Turn. Reverse the direction of turn using 15 degrees of bank
           for 15 seconds. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to resuming the
           turn.
           7.8.2.2.2. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation
           and direct the flight leader to roll out of the turn. Maintain the original turn. The
           leader may only resume the turn when separation is ensured.
       7.8.2.3. Final Approach. Momentarily turn away from lead to ensure clearance and
       execute the published missed approach procedure.
       7.8.2.4. Missed Approach. Momentarily turn away from lead to ensure clearance and
       continue the published or assigned missed approach procedure. Climb to 500 feet above
       missed approach altitude.
   7.8.3. Four-Ship Flights. Number 2 and 3 follow the procedures outlined above. Number
   4's initial action assumes that number 3 has also gone lost wingman. In addition to paragraph
   7.8, number 4 will:
       7.8.3.1. Wings-Level Flight (climbing, descending, or straight and level). Turn away
       using 30 degrees of bank for 30 seconds, then resume the original heading.
       7.8.3.2. Turns.
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                        37


           7.8.3.2.1. Outside the Turn. Reverse direction of turn using 30 degrees of bank for
           30 seconds to ensure separation from lead and number 3.
           7.8.3.2.2. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation
           and increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Direct the leader to roll out. The leader will
           only resume the turn when separation is ensured.
   7.8.4. Leader must acknowledge the lost wingman's radio call. When appropriate, transmit
   attitude, heading, altitude and airspeed.
   7.8.5. If a wingman becomes separated and any aircraft experiences radio failure, the aircraft
   with the operational radio will obtain a separate clearance. The NORDO aircraft will set IFF
   Mode 3C to 7600 while proceeding with previous clearance. If an emergency situation arises
   along with radio failure, set the IFF to 7700 for the remainder of the flight.
   7.8.6. Only practice lost wingman procedures in VMC.
7.9. Spatial Disorientation. Ref AFMAN 11-217V1, Instrument Flight Procedures. Conditions
that prevent a clear visual horizon or increase pilot tasking are conducive to SD. To prevent SD,
the pilot must increase instrument crosscheck rate. Data entry via pop-up keypad is prohibited on
the heads-down EFI when that display is functioning as the sole primary flight reference. If SD
symptoms are encountered:
   7.9.1. Single Ship:
       7.9.1.1. Call up EFI, if not already displayed;
       7.9.1.2. Concentrate on flying basic instruments with frequent reference to the EFI
       display or SFD if EFI is not called up;
       7.9.1.3. If symptoms persist and conditions permit, fly straight and level flight until
       symptoms abate, usually within 60 seconds;
       7.9.1.4. Consider using the autopilot;
       7.9.1.5. If necessary, declare an emergency and advise ATC; and,
       7.9.1.6. It is possible for SD to proceed to the point where the aircrew is incapacitated
       and unable to see or interpret the flight instruments. In this situation, aircraft control may
       be impossible. If this occurs, aircrew should consider ejecting.
   7.9.2. Formation Lead:
       7.9.2.1. Advise the wingmen that flight lead has SD and comply with procedures in
       paragraph 7.9.1;
       7.9.2.2. Use the wingmen to confirm attitude and provide verbal feedback; and,
       7.9.2.3. If symptoms persist, terminate the mission and recover the flight by the simplest
       and safest means possible.
   7.9.3. Formation Wingman:
       7.9.3.1. Advise lead of the disorientation;
       7.9.3.2. Lead will advise wingman of aircraft attitude, altitude, heading and airspeed;
 38                                                              AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012


      7.9.3.3. If symptoms persist and conditions permit, lead will establish straight and level
      flight for 30-60 seconds; and,
      7.9.3.4. If the above procedures are not effective, lead should consider passing the lead
      to the wingman, provided the leader will be able to maintain situational awareness from a
      chase position. Transfer lead while in straight and level flight. Once assuming the lead,
      maintain straight and level flight for 60 seconds. If necessary, terminate the tactical
      mission and recover by the simplest and safest means possible.
   7.9.4. Greater than 2-Ship Formation. Lead should separate the flight into elements to
   more effectively handle a wingman with persistent SD symptoms. Establish straight and level
   flight IAW paragraph 4.4 (Formation Break-up). Consider keeping the element with the SD
   pilot straight and level while the other element separates.
7.10. Armament System Malfunctions.
   7.10.1. Inadvertent Release. Release due to a malfunction of the armament system:
      7.10.1.1. Record switch positions at the time of inadvertent release and provide to
      armament and safety personnel. Record the impact point, if known;
      7.10.1.2. Safe the armament switches and do not attempt further release. Treat remaining
      stores as hung ordnance and follow hung ordnance procedures during RTB; and,
      7.10.1.3. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison them in a suitable area on
      a single pass, if practical.
   7.10.2. Failure to Release/Hung Ordnance. If ordnance fails to release when all
   appropriate switches are set, proceed as follows:
      7.10.2.1. Attempt to release store(s) IAW F-35A FSD. If unsuccessful, and there is NOT
      an unsafe condition, then follow hung ordnance recovery procedures; and,
      7.10.2.2. If an unsafe condition exists (attached by 1 lug, etc.), attempt to jettison store(s)
      using selective jettison procedures.
   7.10.3. Hang fire/Misfire.
      7.10.3.1. A missile that fires but fails to depart the aircraft is a hang fire. If this occurs,
      the missile should be closely observed and safety checked by a chase pilot.
      7.10.3.2. A missile that fails to fire when all appropriate switches were selected is a
      misfire. If this occurs, safe the Master Arm switch and follow the hung ordnance
      recovery procedures.
   7.10.4. Hung Ordnance/Hung Flare/Weapons Malfunction Recovery:
      7.10.4.1. If practical, visually inspect the area for damage to aircraft, WBDs or ordnance;
      7.10.4.2. Declare an emergency for hung flare/ hung live ordnance (not required for hung
      practice/inert ordnance or when no attempt was made to expend live ordnance);
      7.10.4.3. If available, obtain a chase aircraft, avoid populated areas and close trail
      formations;
      7.10.4.4. Close WBDs prior to landing IAW F-35A FSD; and,
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                    39


      7.10.4.5. Land from a straight-in approach.
      7.10.4.6. For a hung gun/hung flare, follow local Hot Gun/Hung Flare procedures.
   7.10.5. Gun Malfunctions.
      7.10.5.1. For a hung or jammed gun immediately cease the delivery and safe the system.
      7.10.5.2. Do NOT attempt to use the gun again or further damage could result.
      7.10.5.3. If any HOT gun symbology remains displayed after selecting Master Arm Safe
      or the gun cannot be verified safe, upon landing recover to a designated Hot Gun area.
      7.10.5.4. Follow Hung Ordnance and Weapons Malfunction Recovery procedures.
   7.10.6. Miscellaneous Procedures.
      7.10.6.1. Pilots will not attempt to expend ordnance using a delivery system with a
      known weapons release malfunction.
      7.10.6.2. When abnormal missile launch or erratic missile flight is noted after launch,
      visually inspect the launching aircraft by another pilot (if possible) to determine if any
      damage has occurred.
      7.10.6.3. WBDs fail to close. Follow FSD and local procedures.
7.11. Post Arresting Gear Engagement Procedures:
   7.11.1. Do not shut down the engine unless directed by the ground crew, there is a fire, or
   other conditions dictate;
   7.11.2. Raise the tail hook on the ground crew's signal;
   7.11.3. Do not taxi until directed; and,
   7.11.4. Comply with local directives.
7.12. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures.
   7.12.1. Simulated Emergency Procedure is defined as any procedure that produces an effect
   that closely parallels an actual emergency.
   7.12.2. Aborted Takeoff Practice. Only practice aborted takeoffs in the simulator.
   7.12.3. Practice in-flight engine shutdown is prohibited.
   7.12.4. Simulated Flameout (SFO). Due to the higher idle thrust of the engine and auto-
   "closing" of speedbrakes with the landing gear down, representative drag of a failed engine is
   difficult to simulate. Live fly SFOs are negative training for an actual flamed out approach;
   therefore, live fly SFOs are prohibited and shall only be practiced in the full mission
   simulator (FMS). OG/CCs will establish specific procedures for SFO training in the FMS.
   7.12.5. Flameout (FO) Emergency Pattern. OG/CCs will establish letters of agreement
   with appropriate agencies for a live flameout (FO) emergency, or procedures for an abnormal
   engine operation approach. They will publish those procedures in their supplement to this
   volume. General live fly FO procedures follow:
 40                                                             AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012


       7.12.5.1. The FO pattern may be entered from any direction or altitude that will ensure
       the aircraft is properly configured above 2,000 feet AGL and in a position to safely
       complete the landing;
       7.12.5.2. Discontinue a FO approach if unable to obtain wings level on final by FSD
       minimums. Discontinue a FO approach if airspeed drops below F-35A FSD minimum
       airspeed anytime between base key and the initiation of the flare. Once the decision to
       discontinue an FO has been made, focus on ejection procedures;
       7.12.5.3. Make radio calls IAW local procedures, but as a minimum call:
           7.12.5.4.1. "High Key;"
           7.12.5.4.2. "Low Key;" and,
           7.12.5.4.3. "Base Key, Gear (as configured)."
7.13. Search and Rescue (SAR) On-Scene Commander Procedures. In event of an aircraft
mishap or ejection, immediately attempt to locate the possible survivor and initiate rescue
efforts. Expect that the survivor may initially suffer from shock or have delayed reactions due to
ejection injuries. The following procedures are by no means complete and should be adjusted to
meet each unique search and rescue situation:
   7.13.1. Knock off maneuvering;
   7.13.2. Establish an on-scene commander;
   7.13.3. Squawk 7700 to alert ATC/tactical radar control agency of the emergency situation;
   7.13.4. Communicate the emergency situation and aircraft/flight intentions immediately to
   applicable control agencies. Use GUARD frequency as last resort;
   7.13.5. Mark the last known position of survivors/crash site using any means available
   (Mark point, TACAN, GPS/INS, ATC/ radar control agency position and/or visual
   references);
   7.13.6. Remain above the highest ejection altitude, if known or the highest observed
   parachute until determining the position of all possible survivor(s);
   7.13.7. Deconflict other aircraft assisting in the SAR by altitude to preclude midair collision.
   Establish high/low combat air patrol (CAP) as necessary to facilitate communications;
   7.13.8. Revise BINGO fuels or recovery bases as required to maintain maximum SAR
   coverage. Do not overfly the adjusted BINGO fuel;
   7.13.9. Relinquish SAR operation to designated rescue forces upon their arrival; and,
   7.13.10. Follow local or briefed procedures.
7.14. Fuel Dumping:
   7.14.1. Only conduct fuel dumping to reduce aircraft gross weight for safety of flight or
   when complying with FSD emergency procedures;
   7.14.2. When circumstances permit, dump above 10,000 feet AGL over unpopulated areas;
   7.14.3. Ensure the dump switch is returned to normal before landing; and,
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                       41


  7.14.4. After landing, make an appropriate entry in the PMA.

                                            Chapter 8

                            LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

8.1. General. This chapter provides a consolidated framework for wings to supplement (IAW
AFI 33-360) local operating procedures. Units composed of multiple aircraft types may publish
guidance in a single, stand-alone local operating instruction instead of supplementing this AFI.
Added or stand-alone procedures will not be less restrictive than those contained elsewhere in
this volume. This chapter is not intended to be a single source document for procedures
contained in other directives or regulations. Avoid unnecessary repetition of guidance provided
in other established directives; however, reference to those directives is acceptable when it serves
to facilitate the location of information. This chapter is authorized to be issued to each pilot.
Units may supplement the following paragraphs for local operating guidance:

                                           Attachment 2
      CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH YIELD
                     EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) OPERATIONS

A2.1. General Information. Potential adversary use of CBRNE weapons against a friendly
airfield presents a serious threat to flying operations. Although the most effective way for
aircrews to avoid this threat is to be airborne before those weapons are detonated/dispersed and
then land at a field that has not been contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate
from a field that has come under CBRNE attack.
A2.2. Mission Preparation. Be aware of the status of the CBRNE environment at the planned
launch and recovery airfields, potential divert bases, and throughout the area in which the sortie
may fly. Know the current and forecast surface wind direction and the Mission Oriented
Personnel Protection (MOPP) level in effect for relevant sectors of the airfield. Don appropriate
aircrew chemical defense equipment (ACDE) or Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) to match the
appropriate MOPP level (reference AFPAM 10-100, Airman's Manual) and carry individual
protective equipment (IPE) as required.
A2.3. Stepping to Fly and Aircraft Preflight. This may entail donning ACDE or transitioning
from GCE to ACDE. Take precautions to protect aircrew from injury and or contamination while
in transit from the squadron facility to the aircraft. If possible, transport aircrew in a vehicle that
provides overhead cover (enclosed vehicle). If aircrew travel on foot is unavoidable, choose a
route that takes maximum advantage of available overhead cover (sun shades, buildings, etc.) to
avoid agents that may be settling from the air. If extra aircrew members are available for
preflight duties, consider assigning them to do so wearing GCE. This will allow the aircrew
actually flying to minimize exposure.
   A2.3.1. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) Prior to Engine Start. If Alarm Red occurs
   during the step or preflight process, take cover and don appropriate MOPP. This may require
   use of the ground crew mask. A hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) provides optimum
   protection, if available. Use caution if entering a HAS that contains aircraft and/or
   equipment. Close doors after entry. If a HAS or other overhead cover is not immediately
   available, accept the best rapidly reachable cover.
A2.4. Engine Start to Takeoff. If a HAS is available, use it to minimize exposure time by
accomplishing aircraft arming and EOR procedures inside it (if local procedures permit) and by
delaying taxi time as long as possible prior to takeoff.
   A2.4.1. Aircraft Launch to Survive (LTS). Units will develop local procedures to provide
   this option to the commander. In general, aircraft may LTS any time after engine start if they
   have sufficient fuel and safe, expeditious access to a runway. This option may only be
   practical for aircraft that are near EOR prior to takeoff or that have just landed.
   A2.4.2. Alarm Red Prior to Taxi. If in a HAS, the normal procedure is to shut down.
   Engine noise may preclude effectiveness of normal alert notification procedures, so ensure
   ground personnel are aware of the alarm warning, assume proper MOPP, and close HAS
   doors. Use hand signals if necessary.
   A2.4.3. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) After Taxi. Units typically establish
   procedures for this contingency depending on whether additional protection is available
AFI11-2F-35AV3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                      53


   along the taxi route (empty HAS, for instance). Ideally, ground crew sheltering in such a
   HAS would be available to assist in normal engine shutdown procedures and to close HAS
   doors. If protection is not available, the best option may be LTS. Maintain contact with
   Command and Control (C2) entities (Wing Operations Center, Maintenance Operations
   Center, Supervisor of Flying, etc.) to ensure unity of effort in the overall plan.
A2.5. Takeoff to Landing.
   A2.5.1. Contamination. If Chemical Warfare (CW) agent contamination occurred prior to
   takeoff, flying the aircraft will dissipate the agent to some degree. The total amount of
   dissipation will be greater with lower flight altitudes and longer flight times. Because the
   agent may have entered wheel wells, flaps, etc., consider flying in landing configuration to
   increase airflow to these areas. In any circumstances, merely flying the aircraft is unlikely to
   achieve complete decontamination.
   A2.5.2. Preparing to Land. Aircrew should remain aware of the status of primary and
   alternate landing locations. Do not attempt to land during Alarm Red situations unless there
   is no other option. Follow C2 directions and either hold or divert. If mission needs preclude
   divert, hold until the Alarm Red (or theater equivalent) has cleared or become an Alarm
   Black. Prior to landing, gain awareness of contaminated sectors of the airfield and of
   current/forecast surface winds. Use this information in conjunction with C2 direction to plan
   a route from landing to engine shutdown. The liquid deposition phase following a CW
   airburst attack can extend up to 1 hour. If landing during Alarm Black, expect a contaminated
   environment and MOPP 4.
A2.6. Landing to Engine Shutdown. Take advantage of any protection available, minimizing
taxi time and distance. Maintain contact with C2 in order to remain aware of unexploded
ordnance and/or damage to airfield movement surfaces. If a HAS is available and local
procedures permit, accomplish aircraft de-arm and EOR procedures there. If Alarm Red (or
Theater Equivalent) occurs between landing and engine shutdown, considerations are similar to
those discussed in the engine-start-to-takeoff section.
A2.7. After Engine Shutdown. Don appropriate MOPP if not already worn. If circumstances
permit, accomplish normal post-flight inspection procedures. If the aircraft is not contaminated,
close the canopy. If there is any suspicion of personnel contamination, aircrew will process
through an aircrew contamination control area (ACCA). Accomplish maintenance debriefings
under cover to the maximum extent possible.
