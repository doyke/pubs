1. Program. Oil Analysis is the process of analyzing oil and other fluids used to lubricate or
operate mechanical equipment, evaluating the condition of the fluid or the equipment from which
the fluid originated, and recommending maintenance actions to the equipment operating activity.
An Oil Analysis Program (OAP) ensures timely and accurate oil analysis support through the
strategic location of oil analysis laboratories and the standardization of procedures, data
elements, analytical instrumentation and diagnostic techniques. The Joint Oil Analysis Program
(JOAP) is a combined effort of the Army, Navy and Air Force to set-up and maintain a standard
program. Oil analysis requires a centrally-managed program and the integration of AF OAP and
JOAP plans.
2. Objectives. The overall objective of the AF OAP is to detect oil-wetted air and space
equipment failures before serious malfunction or secondary damage occurs. The specific
objectives of the AF OAP and JOAP programs are as follows:
     2.1. Improve the operational safety, readiness and economy of military equipment through
     the use of on-board and off-board oil analysis, a condition-monitoring concept that relies on
     the detection and measurement of wear-metals in the fluid.
     2.2. Collect and analyze oil analysis data in order to increase the effectiveness of oil analysis
     techniques in the diagnosis of potential equipment failures and lubricant condition; to provide
     wear metal and lubricant physical property data to the various weapons system managers and
     others, as required.
     2.3. Ensure oil analysis plans and operations are integrated (where practical) to provide:
        2.3.1. Standard laboratory techniques, procedures, data, calibration standards, and
        analytical instruments.
        2.3.2. Inter-service oil analysis support to all military departments.
        2.3.3. The most cost–effective means of determining the condition of lubricants, fluids,
        and mechanical system through the use of various analytical techniques.
3. Guidance. The OAP helps aircraft technicians and supervisors to make informed, condition-
based, preventive maintenance decisions, and can reduce equipment costs, increase equipment
availability, and reduce in-flight risk. This is primarily achieved by monitoring the concentration
of wear metals in fluids used to lubricate or power mechanical systems. To monitor engine
health, the OAP uses a variety of testing mechanisms. These include: Atomic Emission (AE)
spectrometric wear metal analysis, filter debris analysis (FDA), magnetic chip detectors (MCD),
MCDs with on-board sensors, Scanning Electron Microscope/Energy Dispersive X-ray
(SEM/EDX) system technology, and to a very limited extent, physical property testing
(viscosity, water/fuel contamination, additive levels, etc.). To the extent deemed cost effective,
Engine Operating Time (EOT) should be used as the standard time interval between oil analysis
sampling when in-service engines are equipped with an Engine Monitoring System (EMS) or
other operating time recorders. For engines without EMS or other operating time recorders, oil
analysis trending intervals will be standardized based upon Engine Flying Hours (EFH).
     3.1. Analyze oil samples from transient aircraft IAW applicable technical data and owning
     activity requirements.
        3.1.1. For transient aircraft with an EMS, at bases without the capability to download
        EOT data, EFH should be used to continue oil analysis trending.
AFI21-124 14 MARCH 2013                                                                      3


   3.2. Responsible activities must ensure the resultant data is accurate and given promptly to
   all customers so they can effectively monitor the condition of their equipment.
       3.2.1. AF OAP laboratories will periodically (as specified by MAJCOM supplemental
       guidance) evaluate response times to optimize support of the customer.
   3.3. Laboratory operation.
       3.3.1. Each OAP laboratory must be certified IAW TOs 33-1-37-1/-2.
       3.3.2. Seek to maximize inter-service use of existing laboratories through laboratory
       consolidation, workload sharing, and use of standardized instrumentation, techniques and
       procedures.
       3.3.3. Non-depot AF OAP laboratories must provide oil analysis services at no charge
       for all US Government, NATO and friendly Foreign Military Service (FMS) aircraft.
       These services include analyzing oil samples from transient aircraft IAW applicable
       technical data within the AF OAP laboratory capabilities.

monitoring JOAP activities. It is composed of oil analysis program management
representatives from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Marine Corps and Coast Guard
may be included as nonvoting, associate members of the JOAP—CG.
JOAP Executive Committee (JOAP EC)—A team of 06-level representatives from the JOAP
offices of prime responsibility for the services, which works under the authority and direction of
the Air Force Materiel Command, the Army Materiel Command, and the Naval Air Systems
Command. The JOAP EC provides oversight to JOAP Coordinating Group activities.
JOAP Laboratory—An Army Navy, or Air Force oil analysis laboratory operating according to
OAP regulations. Its personnel must be certified according to established JOAP procedures and
capable of providing oil analysis support to the other services.
JOAP Manual—A tri–service manual (NAVAIP 17–15–50.1/50.2/50.3/50.4, TM 38–301–1/–
2/–3/–4, and TO 33–1–37–1/–2/–3/–4) containing consolidated procedures, methods, and
evaluation criteria used by JOAP oil analysis laboratories and customers.
JOAP Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)—The Army, Navy, and Air Force executive
agents responsible for ensuring effective inter-service policy coordination and problem
resolution and providing management control over the irrespective service oil analysis programs.
JOAP Spectrometer—An analytical instrument, approved by the JOAP-CG, used to detect and
measure designated wear metals contained in lubricating oils and other fluid samples.
JOAP Technical Support Center (JOAP—TSC) —An organization composed of technical
representatives from each service that provides technical support to the JOAP and performs
technical task for the JOAP–CG.
Maintenance Planning Working Group (MPWG)—The MPWG is a team consisting of the
engine managers from each using MAJCOM, representatives from the using community,
government development and depot teams, and the engine manufacturer. The purpose of the
MPWG is to review and direct the life management and maintenance plans for the engine. The
MPWG determines the objectives and content of their maintenance program. MPWG plans are
updated based on field and depot experience.
Miss—An OAP laboratory maintenance recommendation followed by a physical finding of no
abnormal wear or potential for catastrophic failure.
Oil Analysis—The process of analyzing oil and other fluids used to lubricate or operate
mechanical equipment, evaluating the condition of the fluid or the equipment from which the
fluid originated, and recommending maintenance actions to the equipment operating activity.
Oil—Wetted Air—Oil moistened air used for lubrication and decreases friction between parts.
Physical Property Analysis—Analytical procedures used to determine the suitability of a
lubricant or fluid for continued use. Tests include analyses for water and fuel contamination,
fluid viscosity, and solids contamination.
Reliability—Centered Maintenance—A logical discipline for developing a scheduled-
maintenance program that will realize the inherent reliability levels of complex equipment at
minimum cost.
Response Time—The elapsed work hours from the time that an analysis request is received in
the oil analysis laboratory and required processing is completed. Laboratory processing is

completed when the sample analysis is evaluated and, if required, action is taken to notify the
customer of a maintenance recommendation.
Spectrometer—An instrument which uses the atomic emission or atomic absorption principle to
identify the types and concentrations of wear metals in used fluid samples.
Spectrometric Analysis—A technique used to detect and measure wear metals and other
elements from oil–wetted components in aeronautical and non-aeronautical equipment
components and to alert maintenance personnel about conditions that may lead to component
failure if not corrected.
Spectrometric Calibration Standard—A mineral oil that contains known quantities of specific
organometallic compounds, has a controlled viscosity and flash point, and is used to calibrate
and standardize spectrometers. Standards composition must be approved y the JOAP–CG.
Technical Order—An AF publication that gives specific technical directives and information on
inspection, storage, operation, modification, and maintenance of given AF items and equipment.
Turn—around Time—The interval encompassing the period from the time the samples is taken
until an answer (maintenance recommendation, request for resample, etc.) is received by the
customer. Turn-around requirements may vary for the individual customers.
Transient Aircraft— Aircraft not assigned to a base that are en route from one location to
another that may require routine servicing. Aircraft deploying to or staging from a base for the
purpose of flying sorties or conducting training with a squadron assigned to the base, with or
without the necessary maintenance support from the home base, are not considered transient
aircraft.
Viscosity Calibration Standard—A fluid of known viscosity used by oil analysis laboratories
to standardize the viscometer.
