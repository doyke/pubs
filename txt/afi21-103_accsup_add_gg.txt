This MESL compliments AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting. It applies
to all MQ-9 Air Combat Command (ACC) units. This Addendum does not apply to Air National Guard or
Air Force Reserve Command units and members that are not in Title 10 status and/or assigned or attached
to ACC operational units. Send recommended changes or comments on AF Form 847, Recommendation
for Change of Publication, to HQ ACC/A8U, 402 Helms Street Suite 130 Langley AFB VA 23665-2791,
and send information copies to the applicable OCR. Maintain official records in accordance with (IAW)
AFMAN 37-123 (to be AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and dispose of them IAW AF Records
Disposition Schedule found at https://afrims/amc.af.mil. Contact supporting record managers, as
required, for approval.


1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground work for
reporting the status of MQ-9 weapon system to include aircraft, ground control stations and Satellite
Communications (SATCOM) suite availability. They list the minimum essential systems and subsystems
that must work on a MQ-9 weapon system to perform specifically assigned unit wartime, training, test or
other missions.
   1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define MQ-9 system exceptions and help explain complex degraded
   mission systems.
   1.2. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major Command
   (MAJCOM) differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another MAJCOM
   theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify the unit's requirements
   and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.

2. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by WUC against the Full Sys-
tems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List (BSLs) across the page. Each unit's Design Opera-
tional Capability (DOC) statement determines applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft MESLs
 2                                           AFI21-103_ACCSUP_ADDENDUM-GG 6 APRIL 2007


 incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft and therefore it is important to compare only those columns listed
 in the MESL which are applicable to the unit's assigned aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime)
 coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to their
 DOC statement. Units with TF (training) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the
 FSL and TNG columns , and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would determine and report status using
 only the FSL and TST columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is reported using the
 MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code.

QUALIFYING NOTES:
1. The MQ-9 weapon system is a “system of systems” designed to allow modular and open-ended
expansion: aircraft with mission-specific kits employed via control station(s) to fit individual mission
needs. Any MQ-9 aircraft may be controlled by either a forward deployed Mobile Ground Control
Station (GCS) and/or a “fixed facility” Main Operating Base GCS. A forward Launch and Recovery
Element (LRE) may perform launches and recoveries. Control of the MQ-9 aircraft may be passed
between any of the control stations at any time. In addition, one LRE may launch multiple MQ-9 aircraft
for multiple GCSs, supporting multiple orbits. The tables above outline the five major systems required
to support MQ-9 “system of systems” approach. HQ ACC/A8U9 must approve requests for deviations.
2. Each MQ-9 aircraft must be capable of carrying mission-specific kits. Mission-specific kits must be
operational and readily available as operational missions dictates.
3. As required by AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
4. Required if expected to fly Beyond Line of Sight.
5. Not required if performing specified mission as RSO.
NOTE: In situations where part(s) of an MQ-9 system are in PJ--Enroute aircraft or PR--Flyable storage
status, those components will be considered MC solely for the purpose of determining system status.
