        aircraft run area, thoroughly familiar with checking the condition of the brake wear
        pin, and must be aircraft marshaling qualified. The ground observer’s training must
        be documented in TBA. They will advise the engine run supervisor if other aircraft,
        vehicles, or personnel enter the propeller blast area, or adverse condition develops
        (e.g., fire, oil leak, etc.). The ground observer will stand at a 45-degree angle forward
        from the crew entrance door and direct personnel away from the propellers.
        1.5.4.2. On C-130H aircraft, the individual occupying the flight engineer’s seat will
        be engine-run qualified for maintenance runs above ground idle. EXCEPTION: A
        student may occupy the flight engineer’s seat for training, provided there is either an
        engine run instructor on the interphone or an engine-run certifying official in the pilot
        or co-pilot seats. The engineer position will be responsible for all switches and
        instruments aft of the fire emergency control handles. The engineer position will
        observe all warning lights and assist the engine-run supervisor as briefed.
  1.6. Engine Run Prerequisites.
     1.6.1. The Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) must be contacted for engine run

        1.6.1.1. Aircraft tail number and parking spot.
        1.6.1.2. Name and G081 employee number of the engine run supervisor.
        1.6.1.3. Approximate run time, number of engines to be run, and whether the run will
        be an on-speed or maximum power run.
     1.6.2. Tower/ground control will be contacted on UHF frequency 275.8 MHZ, after
     obtaining engine run clearance from MOC.
        1.6.2.1. Aircraft tail number and parking spot
        1.6.2.2. Approximate run time, number of engines to be run, and whether the run will
        be an on-speed or maximum power run. Note: Tower/ground control will not
        normally call the MOC to confirm engine run approval. If there is a problem in
        obtaining start clearance, immediately contact the MOC.
     1.6.3. If an aircraft requires additional engine runs for maintenance adjustments, engine
     run clearance will not need to be obtained again unless clearance has been canceled. To
     keep clearance open, contact and advise tower or ground control of intended shutdowns
     and restarts. Cancel run clearance when all runs are complete.

       1.6.4. During times when the tower or ground control is off the air, the MOC will
       perform the coordination requirements of engine maintenance runs. Use UHF 349.4
       MHZ to contact MOC, (call sign Ground Control), and provide engine run information.
       MOC will coordinate all requirements with the security forces and fire department.
    1.7. Additional engine run requirements. WARNING: During engine operation, the
    aircraft bleed air system and potential for aircraft movement poses a significant safety
    hazard. Therefore, during operation of one or more engines, no maintenance will be
    performed on other engines, propellers, or other external portions of the aircraft.
       1.7.1. All personnel involved with engine operation will be on the interphone at all times
       during engine runs. Exception: ground observer must maintain visual contact with run
       supervisor while disconnecting power unit.
       1.7.2. To operate engines during the hours of darkness, the landing lights will be turned
       "ON" and extended to approximately a 45-degree angle. This is done to observe the
       operating engines and vehicle/personnel traffic in the immediate vicinity. Aircraft taxi
       lights will be turned "ON" to help detect aircraft movement.
       1.7.3. After engine shutdown, the engine run supervisor will ensure the required AFTO
       Form 781A entries are made for all discrepancies encountered during the run. If Foreign
       Object Damage (FOD) is encountered, contact the 19 AW FOD Office and ensure quality
       assurance and wing safety are notified by the MOC. Ensure the wing FOD check sheet is
       annotated and forwarded to the Engine Management Branch (EMB) for proper engine
       AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical Data, and CEMS historical entries. An
       investigation in accordance with (IAW) AFI 21-101 and AFI 91-204, Safety Investigation
       and Reports, will be initiated.
       1.7.4. No maximum power runs will be authorized when aircraft are parked tail to tail.
       1.7.5. All engine runs will be called into the MOC. The MOC will verify with the flight
       line expediter, "Engine Run Approved” and broadcast on all radio nets to proceed with
       caution in the run up area. Note: Ensure one spot directly behind running aircraft is
       open during any maintenance engine run at or above flight idle.
       1.7.6. On aircraft parked within or up to two spots directly behind an above ground idle
       engine run, the following actions apply: All exterior maintenance will stop. All panels
       will be secured or removed. All maintenance stands, fire bottles, and AGE support
       equipment will be secured or removed. All engine intake plugs and pitot covers will be
       installed.
       1.7.7. The production supervisor of the unit running engines will notify/coordinate with
       the production supervisor of the other squadron(s) whose aircraft might be affected by the
       prop blast.
    1.8. Special run requirements for leak checks.
       1.8.1. Personnel performing man-on-the-stand duties will meet the following minimum
       requirements:
       1.8.2. Must possess at least a 5-skill level.

     line badges, jewelry, or any other item that could possibly fall out and be ingested in the
     engine.
     1.8.6. Normally, only one person will be permitted access to the stand, with all others
     remaining clear. The individual will approach the stand from the wing tip.
     1.8.7. Ensure that all personnel are clear of the area prior to engine shutdown. Ensure no
     one approaches the stand until the propeller has no rotation and bleed air has been
     removed.
  1.9. Special requirements for self-contained engine starts.
     1.9.1. Self-contained engine starts will be accomplished only after every effort has been
     made to obtain an external power unit. In the event an external power unit is not
     available, only mission-essential engine runs or a critical time factor is the justification
     for a self-contained engine start. EXCEPTION: H3 and C130J aircraft.
  1.10. Requirements for the A/M37T-21 Series Turboprop Test Stand Operation.
     1.10.1. Prerequisite qualifications for test stand operator/ground observer:

     second examination will not be administered without written authorization from the
     Centralized Repair Facility (CRF) superintendent.
     1.10.8. The UTM will update G081 upon completion of initial EMR. The UTM will
     update G081 upon satisfactory completion of the Phase III examination, both normal and
     emergency procedures, and practical evaluation.
     1.10.9. Individuals who do not perform satisfactorily on their practical evaluation will
     immediately be “disqualified” to operate engines on the test stand and decertified in their
     TBA , Individual Training Record, and G081. Decertified individuals will require
     additional training prior to being administered a second practice evaluation.
     1.10.10. The CRF superintendent will select qualified technicians for engine start and
     run-up duties. The maintenance operations officer or squadron maintenance
     superintendent will approve personnel selections.

       1.10.11. Test stand operations will be conducted using TO 1C-130B-2-4CL-2,
       Organizational Maintenance Checklist Engine Mobile Test Stand. The test stand run
       crew will be comprised of four people. The supervisor will be test stand qualified and in
       charge of all activities during engine operation. The recorder will remain in the test stand
       control cab and document all readings on the test cell run sheet. Two ground observers
       will be outside the cab. Each will be positioned on opposite sides of the test stand to
       monitor the engine during operation. All personnel will be on headset and will remain in
       communication during the entire engine run. Note: As a minimum one ground observer
       will be fully qualified. The other observer may be fully qualified or in training as a
       ground observer.
       1.10.12. During the leak check portion of the engine run, normally only one person at a
       time will be allowed on the stand and must be in full view of the other ground observer at
       all times. However, there may be instances when two personnel are required on both
       sides of an engine performing leak checks. All Cautions, Warnings, and applicable steps
       in TO 1C-130H-2-71JG-00-1 will be followed.
       1.10.13. Engines may be operated throughout all power ranges with cowlings and access
       panels either completely installed or completely removed.
2. C-130 ENGINE COMPRESSOR WASHES
    2.1. Guidelines.
       2.1.1. T56 engine compressor washes enhance the service life of engine compressors.
       2.1.2. As a result of exhaustive studies, as well as a change in compressor plating, it is no
       longer required to contact the applicable environmental manager prior to performing any
       compressor wash; provided aircraft and engine compressor wash limitations for Little
       Rock AFB are not exceeded as outlined in Table 2.7 (compressor wash limitations), and
       section 2.7 (Policy) within this instruction.
       2.1.3. The 19 MOS Plans, Scheduling, and Documentation (PS&D) will coordinate with
       the 314 MOF PS&D and 189AW PS&D to establish aircraft and/or engine compressor
       wash priority based on mission requirements.
       2.1.4. 19 MOS MOC will track all aircraft and engine compressor washes performed
       within the 19th EMS wash rack, (bldg 228/233), 189 AW wash rack (bldg 206), or test
       cell (bldg 391) and ensure base environmental requirements are not exceeded.
       2.1.5. Production supervisors will inform MOC and coordinate with the applicable
       PS&D section for all aircraft and engine compressor washes prior to starting
       maintenance. They will ensure a distinction between aircraft and/or engine compressor
       washes is clearly stated. EXAMPLE: 1 aircraft wash with 2 engine compressor washes,
       or 1 aircraft wash with no engine compressor washes, 1 engine compressor wash only,
       etc.
       2.1.6. If compressor wash is required at a deployed location, contact the deployed or host
       base quality assurance for guidance on compressor wash procedures.
LITTLEROCKAFBI21-123 2 JULY 2013                                                              7


  2.2. Criteria for compressor washes.
     2.2.1. TO 1C-130A-6 Change 8 requires compressors to be washed every 180 days
     unless granted a waiver by MAJCOM. The need for out of cycle compressor washes shall
     be determined by maintenance supervision after evaluating the mission, operating
     environment, engine performance, and compressor hours.
        2.2.1.1. If a low power condition is not corrected after completing the compressor
        low power checklist (attachment 2), then perform a compressor wash.
     2.2.2. All engines at Little Rock AFB found to have other than normal oil film build-up
     within the power section (determined by a propulsion 7-level or higher), require a
     compressor wash. Pay close attention after excessive propeller or thrust nut leaks. A
     wash will be performed when an engine experiences a static oil leak with evidence within
     the compressor section. This is deemed to be detrimental to engine reliability. A
     compressor wash will be coordinated through the production supervisor.
     2.2.3. Aircraft operating near a salt water environment or returning from missions that
     flew below 500 feet over salt water will have a compressor water wash performed as
     required in accordance with TO 1C-130H-2-00GE-00-1 and 2J-T56-101CL-1. Water
     washes are considered compressor cleaning and will be accomplished at approved
     locations (see para. 2.l.1).
     2.2.4. When aircraft return from desert operations, technicians will perform an inspection
     of the compressor's 5th and 10th stage bleed valves in accordance with applicable
     technical data to determine if the compressor, or 5th and 10th stage bleed valves have
     enough dirt build-up to be detrimental to engine reliability. This inspection must be done
     no later than 14 days after return to home station, or prior to next aircraft deployment,
     whichever comes first.
  2.3. Compressor wash procedures for test cell.
     2.3.1. All compressor washes performed on the test cell will be performed in a manner to
     deflect the residue onto the test cell pad throughout the wash procedure.
     2.3.2. Test cell will ensure compressor wash residue is directed down the sanitary sewer
     drain, not the storm drain, after completion of the compressor wash.
  2.4. Compressor wash procedures for wash rack Bldg 228/233:
     2.4.1. Refer to LCL-19AW-8 for wash rack set-up.
     2.4.2. If performed in conjunction with an aircraft wash, engine compressor washes will
     not begin until the wash rack supervisor and unit production supervisor verify the aircraft
     wash is complete.
     2.4.3. As a minimum, five personnel are required to perform compressor washes in the
     wash rack. Mechanic A will be an engine run qualified mechanic to motor engines,
     Mechanic B will be a brake operator qualified mechanic, Mechanic C will operate the
     wash cart, Mechanic D will be the air cart operator/ground observer, and Mechanic E will
     be the primary ground observer using the interphone system. Mechanics C, D and E will
     monitor area for obstruction and personnel entering\exiting hangar to ensure personnel
     safety and safe operation of aircraft.

     2.5. Compressor wash limitations.
        2.5.1. Locations:
            2.5.1.1. The only authorized locations are: 19 EMS wash rack (bldg 228 and 233),
            189 ANG outdoor wash rack (bldg 206), and test cell (bldg 391).
        2.5.2. Quantity:
            2.5.2.1. Due to all four approved sites being connected to a single water treatment
            facility collection point, no more than 3 cumulative aircraft washes, and 10
            cumulative engine washes between the 4 approved sites will be performed within a 24
            hour period.
     2.6. Matrix.
        2.6.1. The matrix in Table 1 is an example of the sewage load limitation for a 24-hour
        period:

     2.7. Policy
        2.7.1. Environmental impact:
            2.7.1.1. Aircraft and compressor washes, through repeated tests, are shown to
            produce cadmium and chromium metals in the wash water effluent. Little Rock Air
            Force Base is limited on the amount of cadmium and chromium disposed through the

3. PROPELLER AND ENGINE CHANGE PROCEDURES
  3.1. General Information:
     3.1.1. In an effort to ensure the most efficient use of propellers and engines at Little
     Rock AFB, the following policy regarding propeller and engine changes has been
     established. The Points of Contact (POCs) for all propeller and engine quick-turns or
     changes will be the 19th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) production
     superintendents, 314th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) production
     superintendents, the 19th CMS production superintendent, and the CRF superintendent.
     3.1.2. Storage and issue. All propellers will be stored and issued from the 19th Logistics
     Readiness Squadron, located in building 450. Engines will be stored and issued by the
     CRF.
  3.2. Propeller procedures.
     3.2.1. Troubleshooting. When troubleshooting of a propeller discrepancy indicates a
     propeller change, a 7-level propulsion craftsman will verify the condition. If an AMXS
     7-level is not available, coordinate with CMS supervision for 7-level verification.
     Coordinate with CMS production superintendent for possible quick-turn repair of the
     propeller before ordering a new assembly. If the propeller pump housing rear shaft lip
     seals are leaking and no other reason warrants a quick-turn, the AMXS will replace the
     seal. Each AMXS will add pre-built rear lip seals to their bench stock, local NSN
     5330L0014534460. The CRF will be responsible for pressing all rear lip seals into their
     moon plate assembly for the base bench stock fill levels. If needed, contact the CRF for
     consultation. All propellers will be candidates for quick-turn maintenance unless
     removed for blade or hub split line leaks. For discrepancies other than a blade or hub
     split line leak, quick-turn procedures listed below will be followed.
     3.2.2. Propeller quick-turns: Quick-turns will be coordinated through CMS production
     superintendent and the CRF. Quick-turns should take no longer than 6 hours during
     normal duty hours, and 8 hours if received after normal duty hours Monday through
     Friday. During weekends, completion times will be coordinated through CMS production
     superintendent and the CRF.
     3.2.3. Propellers will be quick-turned under the following conditions:
         3.2.3.1. Propeller can be repaired (quick-turn) and returned to the AMXS in time to
         prevent the cancellation of the aircraft’s next scheduled mission. Real-world
         deployments and Higher Headquarter Joint Chief of Staff missions (CREDIBLE CAT
         aircraft) are an exception to this policy.
         3.2.3.2. When the total spares available on home station are less than 8. Exception:
         AMXS/CMS Supervision may coordinate propeller issue when below WRE. This
         decision will be based upon the CRF superintendent input and after close
         consideration of forecast requirements, availability, and flying schedule.
         3.2.3.3. Aircraft could not fly next scheduled mission even if a replacement propeller
         was issued.

  3.3. Engine procedures.
     3.3.1. For low power engine conditions, the AMXS will comply with requirements
     contained in Chapter 2, C-130 Engine Compressor Washes. The compressor wash is the
     only requirement that depends on facility availability. A full run sheet (to include
     compressor discharge pressure) will be given to the CRF prior to issue of a replacement
     engine.
     3.3.2. Engines will be issued to replace those with worn or damaged compressor
     modules. For turbine, accessory drive housing (ADH) or reduction gearbox (RGB)
     failures, the CRF will be given the opportunity to quick-turn the engine before issuing a
     replacement based on Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) calculations. The
     turbine, ADH and RGB will be ordered by the owning AMXS. The turbine seal break-in
     run will be accomplished by the AMXS. The AMXS may request the engine be run
     across the test cell (dependent upon test cell availability); however this will delay the
     engine’s return to the flight line.
     3.3.3. Engine component quick-turns will be coordinated through CMS production
     superintendent and the CRF superintendent. For –15 turbine changes, close coordination
     between AMXS and CMS will be required due to module availability. Quick-turn repairs
     for engine RGB changes should be completed within 12 hours, if received during normal
     duty hours; within 16 hours, if received after normal duty hours. ADH quick-turns should
     be completed within 12 hours, if received during normal duty hours; within 16 hours, if
     received after normal duty hours. All quick-turns during weekends will require
     coordination with CMS production superintendent.
     3.3.4. Engines will be quick-turned under the following circumstances:
         3.3.4.1. Engine can be repaired (quick-turn) and aircraft returned to service in time to
         prevent cancellation of the aircraft’s next scheduled mission.
         3.3.4.2. T56-15 engines will be evaluated as quick-turn candidates based on the
         Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) predictor tool providing a minimum of
         1,000 hours Estimated Time on Wing (ETOW).
  3.4. Responsibilities.
     3.4.1. The CRF is responsible for the removal and replacement of the RGB, turbine
     module, ADH and all associated tasks.
     3.4.2. The owning unit is responsible for all other maintenance. The owning unit will
     forward the equipment change sheet LRAFB IMT 6A for C130 E/H and LRAFB IMT 6B
     for C130J to engine management branch (EMB) when an engine/propeller is removed for
     any reason.
     3.4.3. Unsettled differences among the POCs for this procedure shall be immediately
     elevated to the AMXS maintenance operations officer or superintendent and the CMS
     maintenance operations officer or superintendent for resolution. A 7-level propulsion
     craftsman will be available in shop during normal duty hours (0700-2300, Monday-
     Friday). During off-duty hours, the CMS production superintendent will contact the CRF
     superintendent. Off-station aircraft and Maintenance Repair Team (MRT) requirements
     will be coordinated through the CMS production superintendent who will ensure an
LITTLEROCKAFBI21-123 2 JULY 2013                                                           11


     engine is immediately approved for issue, as required. Adherence to this policy will help
     ensure sufficient availability of propellers and engines to meet Little Rock AFB mission
     requirements.
