              NUCLEAR SURETY STAFF ASSISTANCE VISIT PROGRAM.

1.1. Scope of the Nuclear Surety Staff Assistance Visit (NSSAV) Program. The Secretary of
the Air Force established the NSSAV program to assist nuclear tasked units, on a non-attribution
basis, in maintaining effective nuclear surety programs. The NSSAV is an opportunity to receive
assistance from experienced headquarters personnel who write nuclear surety policy and
guidance. It is not an inspection nor is it intended to prepare units to pass Nuclear Surety
Inspections (NSI). NSSAV will not give a rating, score, grade, or assessment statements about
units, however if the NSSAV team identifies critical systemic deficiencies, they can recommend
that the wing conduct root cause analysis of each critical deficiency and provide results to the
NSSAV Lead Division or Team Chief. Assessment statements will be limited to processes and
procedures.Attachment 2outlines typical areas observed during an NSSAV. Wing commanders
may use the NSSAV results to strengthen the unit Nuclear Surety Program. MAJCOMs will
designate a division (lead division) as Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for the NSSAV
program. This division will coordinate with other HQ divisions on nuclear surety staff assistance
visit policy issues and guidance. Applicable HQ staff agencies act as offices of collateral
responsibility (OCR). The NSSAV also provides an opportunity for resolution and clarification
of issues between the unit and headquarters functional managers. The objective is threefold:
1.1. (AFMC)AFMC lead for NSSAV program is HQ AFMC/A10 with the following
objectives.
     1.1.1. Determine if higher headquarters guidance is adequate and clear.
     1.1.2. Provide feedback to the wing commander on whether the unit is properly applying
     sound procedures to implement Nuclear Surety guidance.
     1.1.3. Provide situational awareness on command nuclear surety to senior leadership in the
     form of an NSSAV executive summary and annual crossfeed report.
1.2. Assistance Areas. NSSAV team assesses all areas included in CJCSI 3263.05, Nuclear
Weapons Technical Inspection, and AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities as supplemented.
Additional areas may be assessed by MAJCOM staffs as time permits or when requested by
MAJCOM/CC or wing leadership.
     1.2.1. (Added-AFMC) The NSSAV team assesses the 377 Air Base Wing (ABW) within
     the scope of the published Maintenance Capability Letter and associated Design Operational
     Capability statement(s). NSSAV functional expert(s) will observe Cyber Transport Systems
     work center personnel perform proper Intrusion Detection System (IDS) maintenance
     practices.
     1.2.2. (Added-AFMC) The NSSAV team assesses the Cryptologic Systems Division
     (CPSD) within the scope of this GSU’s Nuclear Surety mission. NSSAV functional experts
     will observe the PRP as it relates to personnel actions and Safety as it relates to nuclear
     surety.
        1.2.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Technical Engineering and Rivet MILE organizations provide
        specific maintenance capabilities on behalf of Nuclear Certified Wings. Therefore, the
        SAV team assesses the impact this organization has on the respective Wings’ ability to
AFI91-121_AFMCSUP_I 5 FEBRUARY 2013                                                           5


      comply with areas included in CJCSI 3263.05, Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspection
      and AFI 90-201, Inspector
   1.2.3. (Added-AFMC) AFNWC Operating Location-Ramstein also provides specific
   maintenance capabilities on behalf of nuclear certified Wings. The SAV team assesses the
   impact this organization has on the respective Wing’s ability to comply with areas included
   in CJCSI 3263.05, and AFI 90-201, as supplemented. Observations will focus on
   Engineering Liaison Office Operations and assigned periodic maintenance activities (e.g.,
   Communications, Weapons Maintenance Truck, and Weapons Storage Vault).
1.3. Method of Assessment.
   1.3.1. For Weapons Maintenance Technical Operations, NSSAV team member(s) will select
   team composition for each specific technical operation. Selections will be completely
   unbiased. To the maximum extent possible, the NSSAV member will ensure equitable
   observation across all maintenance shifts and avoid observation of the same person on
   multiple tasks. Assessments will emphasize performance against approved safety, security,
   and reliability standards.
      1.3.1.1. (Added-AFMC) To ensure team integrity, the NSSAV/SAV member will
      select a complete team at random from those teams offered by the unit. The
      NSSAV/SAV member will not pick and choose specific technical operation personnel
      from across teams presented. Maintenance team integrity will be maintained.
      1.3.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Technical Operations NSSAV/SAV evaluators will employ
      the Technical Operation Briefing located at Attachment 4.
   1.3.2. Team integrity for the weapons load crews will be maintained IAW AFI 21-101,
   Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, and AFI 21-202, Missile and Space
   Systems Maintenance Management, requirements. To demonstrate their knowledge and
   proficiency, they will normally be tasked to perform at least one evaluation of a maintenance
   operation within their area of responsibility. Unit quality assurance and weapons
   standardization evaluators may be observed by the NSSAV team.
      1.3.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Unit Quality Assurance (QA) will be observed conducting
      evaluations by the NSSAV team. To demonstrate knowledge and proficiency, QA
      evaluators will perform at least one evaluation of a maintenance operation within their
      area of responsibility.
   1.3.3. For Weapon Security, NSSAV functional area experts will use performance based
   methodology to determine whether a unit meets the Nuclear Weapons Security Standard
   (NWSS). They will observe the integrated execution of security actions and response
   (performance), and compliance with technical criteria, as applicable. They will observe
   execution of applicable plans and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). They will
   assess the effectiveness of active/passive defenses, deployed delay/denial systems, and other
   technology. Did the unit use available options to prevent the loss of/deny access to nuclear
   weapons to the adversary to include destruction of the weapon? To the maximum extent
   possible, the NSSAV functional area members will develop realistic nuclear security exercise
   scenarios to determine a unit’s ability to meet NWSS. NSSAV team will assess the adequacy
   of and compliance with approved compensatory measures for MAJCOM approved security
   deviations.

       1.3.3.1. (Added-AFMC) The NSSAV team will review 377 ABW/EET developed
       exercise scenario and objectives prior to arrival and provide injects that help to gauge the
       Wing’s incorporated responses. Areas of focus include but are not limited to
       effectiveness of interagency communication and execution of cross-organizational
       activities. Appropriate NSSAV team members should participate in wing EET final
       preparation meeting to ensure exercise Master Scenario Events List (MSEL) injects
       includes action to evaluate functional objectives.
       1.3.3.2. (Added-AFMC) In addition to the base level exercise, NSSAV security team
       members will conduct several tactical level exercises of Security Forces response, testing
       several SF Flight elements ability to conduct weapons denial, and in failing denial,
       weapons recapture/recovery. The NSSAV team will develop realistic exercise scenarios
       based on current local threat analysis and evaluate SF tactical ability to mitigate and
       counter the threat.
       1.3.3.3. (Added-AFMC) The NSSAV Team will observe IDS maintenance and system
       management practices to verifying compliance with DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108,
       The Air Force Nuclear Weapon Security Manual, Volumes 1, 2, and 3. Additionally, IDS
       maintenance compliance will also be assessed utilizing Technical Orders (TO)
       particularly 00-33A-1001, and local Operating Instruction (OI) guidelines will also be
       assessed.
    1.3.4. Random nuclear surety testing will be administered, as per AFI 91-101, to a minimum
    of 25 percent of available Personnel Reliability Program personnel in the wing (i.e. not on
    TDY/leave).
    1.3.4. (AFMC) Tests will be derived from the Air Force Safety Center validated test bank
    as prescribed in AFI 91-101, paragraph 2.17.4. Weapons Safety Managers and applicable
    unit safety representatives will assist in the control and administration of testing materials.
    Minimum passing score on the written test is 80 percent.
    1.3.5. A minimum of 5 percent of personnel and medical PRP records will be reviewed for
    compliance with governing DoD and AF guidance. NSSAV team will review the
    administrative qualifications, certification, continuing evaluation, removal from PRP duties,
    return to duty, training and management processes, using record reviews to substantiate
    above processes employed by the unit. PRP processes, not records reviews will be the
    primary focus.
    1.3.6. Command Post Controller closed book testing will be administered at bases with a
    strategic (USAFE: Non-Strategic Nuclear Forces Command Post) tasking to 100 percent of
    available certified controllers (i.e. not on TDY/leave or just ending a 12-hour CP shift).
       1.3.6.1. (Added-AFMC) Passing score on the Command Post Controller closed book
       test is 90 percent or higher.
    1.3.7. MAJCOMs will determine additional items to be observed during the NSSAV based
    upon wing commander input, NAF input and on unique mission requirements.
    1.3.8. For associate/Total Force Integration (TFI) units, the active duty unit will have
    responsibility for the associate/TFI unit outlined in this instruction.
AFI91-121_AFMCSUP_I 5 FEBRUARY 2013                                                         7


1.4. NSSAV Trip and Event Scheduling.
   1.4.1. The lead division schedules all unit NSSAVs and coordinates with appropriate
   MAJCOM agencies. These visits should occur 6 to 8 months after each unit’s last NSI. This
   interval provides a mid-course assessment point between no-notice NSIs while minimizing
   the probability of an NSI occurring prior to a scheduled NSSAV. For example, if an NSI
   occurs in Jul 08, the next NSSAV should be scheduled between Jan-Mar 09. The only
   exception to this scheduling guidance is when a wing commander requests an out-of-cycle
   NSSAV. Exception: USAFE may deviate from this schedule as required to accommodate
   host nation requirements and the Functional Expert Visit Program.
   1.4.1. (AFMC) In addition, HQ AFMC/A10I will also coordinate NSSAV/SAV schedule
   with HQ AFMC/IG Gatekeeper to ensure NSSAVs/SAVs are added to the Gatekeeper
   Schedule.
   1.4.2. MAJCOMs will provide a notification message to the NAF/Center and unit 60 days
   prior to the planned visit confirming NSSAV date, lead division point of contact (POC),
   billeting, transportation and team work center requirements (provide an info copy to the
   installation-owning MAJCOM if NSSAV is for a tenant unit). Units will appoint a NSSAV
   POC and forward the name to the MAJCOM within one week of receiving the notification
   message.
   1.4.2. (AFMC) Direct notifications will include AFNWC/DS, HQ AFMC/A4MW,
   AFNWC/LG and AFSC/LG.
   1.4.3. Units will locally coordinate and provide inputs on a proposed NSSAV Schedule of
   Events. They are encouraged to identify special emphasis areas affecting nuclear surety.
   Units will send a draft schedule to the MAJCOM NLT 40 days prior to the scheduled visit.
   MAJCOMs will ensure the proposed schedule fulfills NSSAV requirements and coordinate
   the proposed schedule of events within the staff. NSSAV team members will coordinate
   functional area specific scheduling requirements with their unit POCs. A confirmed schedule
   of events should be completed NLT 14 days prior to NSSAV team arrival. After the visit and
   events schedule is confirmed, any scheduling conflicts must be immediately brought to the
   attention of the MAJCOM NSSAV POC for resolution.
   1.4.3. (AFMC) The 377 ABW will submit one consolidated Schedule of Events (SOE) that
   includes all affected units; in turn, the NSSAV Team Chief will submit a consolidated Entry
   Authorization List. CPSD, Operating Location-Ramstein and Tech Eng /Rivet MILE
   organizations will submit an SOE that includes all scheduled maintenance and activities
   during the span of the visit. The NSSAV/SAV Team will de-conflict the Tech Eng /Rivet
   MILE schedule of events in close coordination with both organizations at the assessed
   locality. Ideally, these SAVs will occur in conjunction AFGSC, one of the quarterly Rivet
   MILE visits accomplished by the 309 MMXG and the yearly visits accomplished by
   AFNWC/NIET. Confirmed SOEs should be completed NLT 14 days before NSSAV/SAV
   team arrival.
   1.4.4. For installations that have Weapons Storage Area (WSA) production capability
   managed by AFMC, the supported operational wing and supporting AFMC Munitions
   squadron should receive a joint NSSAV. ACC, AFSPC, and AFGSC will make every effort
   to coordinate with AFMC to ensure that their units receive an NSSAV at the same time. The
 8                                              AFI91-121_AFMCSUP_I 5 FEBRUARY 2013


     teams should coordinate the timing of exercises and other events to maximize synergy. This
     reduces the footprint on the installation receiving the NSSAV, and associated activities that
     will be observed require cooperation between the supported wing and the WSA. AFMC may
     conduct limited NSSAVs focused on WSA activities and will limit their scope to only those
     areas for which AFMC is responsible. In doing so, AFMC should try to minimize impact to
     supported wings as much as possible.
        1.4.4.1. For Multi-MAJCOM NSSAVs, fully coordinate a joint schedule of events
        between the installation, and each participating MAJCOM/NAF/Center.                Close
        communications between respective team chiefs is essential to ensure exercises are
        appropriately scheduled and evaluated and do not interfere with other events, and events
        are properly synchronized such that access and exposure are minimized (e.g. conduct
        safety, facility/LPS, alarm system and sensor assessments in conjunction with stockpile
        assessments as much as possible where appropriate).
        1.4.4.2. The host installation should (when possible) receive a joint NSSAV report from
        ACC, AFSPC, or AFGSC on installations supporting a WSA.
        1.4.4.2. (AFMC) If a joint SAV occurs, the AFMC assessed unit (Technical
        Engineering/Rivet MILE) will only receive the AFMC report.
        1.4.4.3. The outbrief will be combined for both the host wing and the supporting WSA,
        with team chiefs from ACC/AFSPC/AFGSC and AFMC briefing the NSSAV results.
        1.4.4.4. Critical deficiencies will be resolved as described in paragraph 2.2 within the
        same MAJCOM. The host wing will resolve its critical deficiencies with AFGSC, and
        the supporting WSA will resolve its critical deficiencie(s) with AFMC.
1.5. NSSAV Funding. MAJCOMs will ensure that an adequate annual budget and manpower
exists to fund all TDY costs associated with providing NSSAV visits to all nuclear wings within
6-8 months after a full NSI (approximately every 12-18 months). The NSSAV budget should be
managed by the lead division. MAJCOMs will determine guidance for compensation of civilian
NSSAV team members working overtime during the visit.
1.5. (AFMC)Although HQ AFMC/A10 provides TDY funding for augmentees,
compensation for any civilian NSSAV/SAV team member working overtime during the
visit will be the responsibility of the assigned unit. The NSSAV/SAV Team’s intention
should be to visit a unit at or around the halfway mark between a unit’s NSI windows.
1.6. NSSAV Team Composition and Requirements.
     1.6.1. MAJCOMs will determine the required size of NSSAV teams. NSSAV team
     members are drawn from applicable MAJCOM staff agencies. When necessary or desired,
     other units and/or organizations may augment the team. MAJCOMS will determine the
     priority for units from which to draw augmentees. Actual NSSAV team size, composition,
     and requirements will vary according to base and assigned nuclear mission. The team should
     consist of a cross-functional group of specialists representing the functional areas that
     contribute to nuclear surety at the wing receiving the NSSAV. MAJCOMs will determine
     team composition for each base that receives an NSSAV.
     1.6.1. (AFMC) NSSAV/SAV teams consist of a team chief and team members; numbers
     will vary according to base and assigned nuclear mission. Upon request of the NSSAV/SAV
AFI91-121_AFMCSUP_I 5 FEBRUARY 2013                                                             9


   team chief, team members may be drawn from applicable HQ AFMC Directorates, AFNWC
   Divisions and Units, HQ AFGSC Directorates and Units, and HQ AF Directorates in that
   order. Augmentee selection is at the discretion of the NSSAV/SAV Team Chief with final
   approval from the HQ AFMC/A10 Director. The team will consist of a cross-functional
   group of specialists representing all functional areas that contribute to nuclear surety at the
   unit receiving the NSSAV. Refer to Table 1.1. for base-specific requirements.
   1.6.2. The division chief of the lead division will normally be the NSSAV team chief.
   MAJCOMs may designate other personnel as NSSAV team chiefs where appropriate (i.e.
   limited NSSAVs, division chief availability, etc).
   1.6.3. If available, host wings will provide on base billeting for NSSAV team members. Off
   base billeting for military members must be approved by the team chief prior to team arrival.
   1.6.4. Government owned vehicles will be provided for team member transportation.
   MAJCOMs will determine standard requirements.
   1.6.4. (AFMC) Refer to Table 1.2. for typical standard requirements. All government-
   owned vehicle (GOV) operators must meet requirements IAW AFI 24-301, Vehicle
   Operations.
   1.6.5. MAJCOMs will determine work center requirements.            This work center will be
   accessible to NSSAV team members at all times.
   1.6.5. (AFMC) Refer to Table 1.2. for work center requirements. Uniform of the Day for
   active duty NSSAV team members will be flight suit/ABU. For GS/contractor employee’s
   proper civilian attire will be worn.
1.7. NSSAV Duration and Meetings. MAJCOMs will determine the duration of NSSAVs
based on mission requirements. Direct interaction between team chief, all team members, the
wing or unit commander and respective staff is highly encouraged to ensure the NSSAV
efficiently accomplishes its objectives.
   1.7.1. The team chief conducts an inbrief with the wing or unit commander and key staff.
   This inbrief will normally include:
       1.7.1.1. Unit Mission Brief for NSSAV Team Members.
       1.7.1.2. Any local condition and safety briefings required by the unit (if not
       accomplished upon NSSAV team arrival).
       1.7.1.3. Formal NSSAV inbrief by NSSAV Team Chief.
          1.7.1.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Formal NSSAV/SAV in-brief by NSSAV/SAV Team
          Chief will include purpose, requirements, focus areas (Special Interest Items (SII’s)),
          wing commander-requested focus areas, and coordinated NSSAV/SAV SOE.
   1.7.2. The team chief conducts an outbrief with the wing or unit commander and designated
   unit staff. The outbrief location is determined by the wing commander.
       1.7.2.1. (Added-AFMC) The Team Chief conducts an out-brief with the wing/unit
       commander and designated unit staff that outlines NSSAV/SAV team identified strengths
       and observations, assistance offered, lessons learned, and recommendations to the
       wing/unit commander and selected staff. The formal out-brief is normally preceded by a

       pre outbrief where the Team Chief discusses the out-brief content with the wing/unit
       commander in an informal format. For multi-MAJCOM NSSAVs, the out-brief may be
       combined.
   1.7.3. Time permitting, functional team leads should conduct an outbrief with the
   appropriate unit commander.
       1.7.3.1. (Added-AFMC) On a daily basis, NSSAV/SAV team functional leads will
       conduct informal outbriefs with appropriate unit leadership.
       1.7.3.2. (Added-AFMC) The NSSAV/SAV team typically conducts daily team
       meetings at 1700L where the NSSAV team functional leads brief the Team Chief on
       strengths, deficiencies, assistance provided, and lessons learned. Additionally, the Team
       Chief will meet daily with the wing/unit commander to brief significant events and
       observations.
1.8. Unit Preparation. Units should execute self-inspection checklists in reviewable areas prior
to the arrival of the NSSAV Team. This will allow NSSAV members to assist in resolving any
problems found and serves as a check on completeness of the wing's self-inspection checklists.
   1.8.1. Units will provide a copy of their simulations/deviations to the NSSAV team NLT 14
   days prior to the scheduled visit. The NSSAV team chief(s) will approve/disapprove
   simulations before the visit commences.
   1.8.1. (AFMC) Units will work with HQ Functional POCs to determine required
   deliverables (i.e., training records, local OIs, etc.) to be available upon arrival.

             NUCLEAR SURETY STAFF ASSISTANCE VISIT SUMMARY.

2.1. NSSAV Report.
   2.1.1. NSSAV reports assist the units in identifying strengths and areas for improvement in
   order to enhance overall nuclear surety effectiveness. Identified deficiencies will reference
   governing instructions and guidance (i.e. AFI, MAJCOM Instructions, T.O., USSTRATCOM
   Publications, etc.) NSSAV reports will be classified IAW CJCSI 3263-05 Enclosure F, para
   2.
   2.1.1. (AFMC) NSSAV reports will be annotated IAW AFI 31-401, Information Security
   Program Management, and other governing guidance and instructions for document marking
   2.1.2. The NSSAV team project officer uses inputs provided by each functional team
   member to build the report in accordance with the contents listed at Attachment 2. The
   NSSAV team chief will provide a draft copy of the NSSAV report to the wing commander
   prior to the team’s departure and provide a copy to the lead division upon return to the staff
   location. The authority for further distribution resides with the wing and/or MAJCOM/CC.
   The Air Force Safety Center, AF/A10, MAJCOM Directorates and Special Staff,
   Associate/TFI MAJCOM, NAF/Center CCs will receive the report’s Executive Summary
   within 20 days. The lead division retains an office record copy on file, and has the option to
   distribute detailed reports outside of the division with the approval of the MAJCOM/CC.
   The report will not be distributed to the Inspector General (IG) nor will NSSAV results be
   discussed with the IG to preserve NSSAV program integrity. Additionally, to preserve
   program integrity, NSSAV team members will not be used as IG augmentees at a wing where
   they have performed an NSSAV in the past 12 months.
   2.1.3. Team members include all nuclear surety-related deficiencies (positive/benchmark
   comments and deficiencies) in the detailed report. Deficiencies will be referenced by
   instruction and paragraph number to the maximum extent possible. Overall and sub-area
   ratings are not assigned. Criticality of deficiencies will be determined IAW AFI 90-201 and
   CJCSI 3263.05. Observations are classified in the following categories:
      2.1.3.1. STRENGTH - An observation that highlights strong processes, knowledge, or
      performance.
      2.1.3.2. CRITICAL DEFICIENCY- Any deficiency that would result in an
      unsatisfactory rating as defined in CJCSI 3263.05 and AFI 90-201 if left uncorrected.
      2.1.3.3. SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY- Any deficiency that would result in one or more
      sub areas being rated as unsatisfactory in CJCSI 3263.05 and AFI 90-201 if left
      uncorrected.
      2.1.3.4. MINOR DEFICIENCY - A deviation from published procedure, local or
      otherwise, that does not result in an unreliable weapon or an unsafe or unsecure
      environment.
      2.1.3.5. RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENT AREA - A suggestion to improve a
      process. (Does not require referencing governing instructions or guidance).
 14                                             AFI91-121_AFMCSUP_I 5 FEBRUARY 2013


       2.1.3.6. (Added-AFMC) REPEAT CRITICAL DEFICIENCY - Any deficiency in a
       previous report that would result in an unsatisfactory rating, as defined in CJCSI 3263.05
       and AFI 90-201 if left uncorrected.
       2.1.3.7. (Added-AFMC) REPEAT SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY – Any deficiency in
       a previous report that would result in one or more sub areas being rated as unsatisfactory
       in CJCSI 3263.05 and AFI 90-201 if left uncorrected.
       2.1.3.8. (Added-AFMC) REPEAT MINOR DEFICIENCY - A deviation in a previous
       report that that does not result in an unreliable weapon or an unsafe or unsecure
       environment.
   2.1.4. MAJCOMs will determine the guidance for recognizing Superior Performers.
   2.1.4. (AFMC) NSSAV members will recommend Outstanding Performers/Teams to the
   NSSAV Team Chief, based on observations made during the visit. Approval rests with the
   NSSAV Team Chief.
2.2. Resolving Critical Deficiencies. Immediately after the NSSAV, the wing commander will
provide the lead division with the wing’s designated POC who will formally track resolution of
critical deficiencies. The wing in cooperation with MAJCOM functional experts should apply 8-
step problem solving methodology to deficiencies in order to correct systemic issues. A process
change, if required, may be more critical to providing a sustainable solution than correcting an
individual deficiency.
   2.2.1. NLT 60 days after the completion of the NSSAV, the wing will send a follow-up
   report to the lead division describing corrective actions taken to resolve critical deficiencies.
   2.2.2. Lead division will forward the resolution to the appropriate OPR within the MAJCOM
   HQ to determine the effectiveness of the corrective action. The OPR will then recommend
   either closing out the deficiency or further corrective actions.
   2.2.3. Lead division will compile the comments from the OPRs and create a consolidated
   response to the wing.
   2.2.4. The wing must start an immediate collaborative process with the wing and MAJCOM
   Functional experts to fix the problem, and provide an update to all open critical deficiencies
   (at a minimum) every 30 days thereafter until closed. Lead division will continue to track
   observations until resolved. The MAJCOM/CC will designate a final authority on closing
   out any critical/significant deficiencies.
   2.2.4. (AFMC) HQ AFMC/A10I will serve as the lead division and will coordinate the
   unit’s 8-step problem solving methodology (Root Cause Analysis) and corrective actions
   taken with the appropriate Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) based upon the critical
   deficiency. If OPR(s) recommend(s) taking further action(s), HQ AFMC/A10I will assist the
   unit by guiding efforts toward an integrated resolution. If OPR(s) recommends closure, the
   RCA, corrective actions and all follow-up data will be coordinated with the appropriate
   MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFMs) and briefed by HQ AFMC/A10I Division Chief or
   designate to the HQ AFMC/A10 Director for final approval to close out critical deficiencies.
   An official memorandum to the unit will be signed by the HQ AFMC/A10 Director
   documenting closure. Historical records will be maintained by HQ AFMC/A10I, releasable
AFI91-121_AFMCSUP_I 5 FEBRUARY 2013                                                           15


   only by the direction of the AFMC/CC or the respective wing commander/equivalent. The
   final authority on closing out any critical deficiencies is the HQ AFMC/A10 Director.
2.3. Crossfeed Report. Lead division will publish an annual Nuclear Surety Crossfeed Trends
and Analysis Report. The report will identify deficiencies and their associated root cause(s) and
corrective action(s), but will not attribute the deficiency to a particular wing. NSSAV crossfeed
reports will be classified IAW CJCSI 3263.05, Enclosure F, para 2.
   2.3.1. Annual Crossfeed reports will be distributed to MAJCOM/CC, MAJCOM NSSAV
   Division Leads, NAF/Center CCs, AFSC/SEW, and all subordinate units at which NSSAVs
   occur.
   2.3.2. MAJCOMs will determine an appropriate forum for discussing NSSAV-highlighted
   trends on an annual basis.
   2.3.3. Lead division will provide an annual (CY) Crossfeed report NLT 31 Jan each year to
   other MAJCOMs having a nuclear surety mission, MAJCOM A10 and HAF A10 and
   MAJCOM A9 for posting in a nuclear surety lessons learned database.
   2.3.3. (AFMC) HQ AFMC/A10 will complete the Annual Report NLT 15 Jan for the
   previous calendar year. This report will contain only critical and significant deficiencies,
   with unit identifications and weapons type removed.

                           TECHNICAL OPERATION BRIEFING

Figure A4.1. Technical Operation Brief
 1. My name is__________. I am representing HQ AFMC. I am primarily interested in Safety,
    Security, and Reliability. Discrepancies noted during the task will be documented. If
    Safety, Security or Reliability requirements are violated, I will stop the operation if War
    Reserve (WR) assets are in use. After the task is complete, QA will brief me on their
    observations of the task, prior to out briefing the maintenance team.

 2. Perform the operation as you do day-to-day. Include all required In-Process (IP), Visuals or
    Supervisory inspections. Make certain each of these requirements is clear to me as they are
    being performed.

 3. If I ask questions, give me the answer as you understand the question. If you do not know
    the answer, please consult with someone in your supervisory chain, but answer the question.
    (All answers are due after technical operation is complete).

 4. You are not expected to exceed your normal area of responsibility. If an abnormal situation
    presents itself and is not covered in technical data consult with higher authorities. I will
    expect a full assessment of the nature of the problem and your action to correct the problem.
    All source inputs may be evaluated.

 5. I will evaluate all documentation and entries generated as the result of this technical
    operation.

 6. Please coordinate all deviations prior to the start of the operation; remember to brief me as
    the deviations occur. All training weapons will be treated as WR during the operation.

 7. I am not on PRP; therefore, I cannot be part of a TWO-PERSON team. If I am in the
    immediate area of a critical component it is your responsibility to fulfill the TWO-PERSON
    CONCEPT requirements. I will not test your two-person procedures by intentionally
    misleading you. If I am someplace that I should not be, please ask me to move.
 8. * (Read only if observers are present). During this operation, observers will be present.
      They are not part of a two-person team and should not interact with any member of your
      team throughout this operation.
