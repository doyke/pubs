This WPAFB Instruction replaces the MOU dated August 2004 between the 88th Medical
Operations Squadron/Emergency Services Flight (88 MDOS/SGOE) and the WPAFB Fire
Emergency Services (FES) of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, regarding the provision and
delivery of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to Wright-Patterson AFB (WPAFB). This
Instruction will supersede any and all prior arrangements, formal and informal, on the same
subject. This publication does not apply to the Air National Guard or the Air Force Reserve
Center (ANG/AFRC) units. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to
the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s

1. Scope. Provides guidance and documents agreement on aspects for general support of the
delivery of EMS on WPAFB. Actions and agreements herein apply only to the participating
parties and are not intended to supersede existing regulations.
2. Situation. The following is a list (not all inclusive) of situations pursuant to EMS response
on WPAFB.
 2                                                               WPAFBI44-201 13 MAY 2011


     2.1. WPAFB has elected to institute ALS (Advance Life Support – EMT-P level) as well as
     BLS (Basic Life Support -- EMT-B level) care to the residents, employees, and visitors to the
     base.
     2.2. The sheer volume of the base populace, security considerations; and the size,
     geography, and access roads of WPAFB presents a challenge for timely 911-ambulance
     response to all areas of the base.
     2.3. Paramedic and ALS care is not required for USAF 4N0X1 medical technicians
     however, some may have it.
     2.4. The FES has established a requirement for paramedic training, staffing and certification;
     several firefighters are certified as paramedics by the State of Ohio, with a minimum of one
     firefighter paramedic on-duty in WPAFB Area B to provide ALS coverage.
     2.5. This Instruction establishes the framework for the provision of EMS Services to the
     entire WPAFB, including all privatized housing areas.
3. Assumptions.
     3.1. In the event that there is any disruption of EMS service on the base, it is assumed that
     mutual aid from the community will be able to respond to an ALS or BLS 911-ambulance
     call, in accordance with (IAW) established and existing MOUs with those agencies.
     3.2. 88 MDOS/SGOE will almost always have adequate active clinical staffing on-shift to
     provide a 911-ambulance response.
     3.3. 88 MDOS/SGOE may not have ALS available due to active clinical requirements and
     on-going patient care in the Emergency Services (ES) and may not be able to dispatch
     ambulance IAW DoD standards consisting of an aggregate response time within twelve
     minutes ninety percent of the time.
4. Mission.
     4.1. The primary mission of the 88 MDOS/SGOE in any 911-response call situation is to
     provide emergency field stabilization, definitive care, and transfer IAW current approved
     protocols.
     4.2. The primary mission of FES in any 911-response is to provide life preservation, fire
     prevention, fire suppression, fire control and victim rescue services; and, to augment 88
     MDOS/SGOE as personnel, staffing, and primary firefighting duties will allow.
     4.3. The collaborative efforts of both the 88 MDOS/SGOE and FES endeavor to provide
     around-the-clock ALS EMS care to WPAFB.
5. Execution and Concept of Operations.
     5.1. Procedures for all medical 911-responses.
        5.1.1. The FES, Emergency Communications Center (ECC) receives all 911-calls, and
        will dispatch fire, medical, HAZMAT, and flight-line responses accordingly.
        5.1.2. The FES relays requests for medical response to the 88 MDOS/SGOE. The ES
        Shift Leader will dispatch an ambulance and crew. The ambulance crew will identify
WPAFBI44-201 13 MAY 2011                                                                        3


      themselves to the FD dispatcher as a BLS or ALS crew via radio when leaving the
      WPMC/ES.
      5.1.3. The FES will coordinate with responding emergency vehicles (per FES
      Management plan) the level of care required based on the nature of the emergency (ALS
      or BLS). The ECC is guided by the Emergency Medical Dispatching (EMD) System.
      All ECC dispatchers are EMD trained and qualified in accordance with industry EMS
      standards.
      5.1.4. The FES will respond with the closest emergency vehicle on 911-calls that appear
      to represent a life-threat in accordance with EMD and EMS Medical Director approved
      guidelines on WPAFB. The FES will also respond to all calls that include mutual aid
      when an ambulance unit is not available from the 88 MDOS/SGOE. The FES shall have
      a paramedic on duty 24-hours daily in WPAFB Area B.
      5.1.5. Should an ill or injured patient require ALS care and the 88 MDOS/SGOE
      ambulance is responding BLS, the FES paramedic will assume care of the patient and
      will accompany the patient, with the ambulance crew, or the mutual aid ALS crew will
      assume care and transport the patient.
      5.1.6. In the event that the day-to-day operations of the ES preclude an ambulance
      response, the ECC will request a mutual aid ambulance response from the local
      community in accordance with established mutual aid agreements.
      5.1.7. In the event any discordance of opinions or judgments with the disposition of a
      patient in the field, the paramedics, both 88 MDOS/SGOE and FES, as applicable, along
      with the on-shift supervising ES Physician will conduct a post incident critique. The
      results of this briefing will subsequently be staffed to the EMS Medical Director, the ES
      Flight Commander and the Fire Chief for resolution of any conflicts.
      5.1.8. In support of FES live fire training evolutions, 88 MDOS/SGOE shall provide an
      ambulance on-site for stand-by purposes.
6. Checklists/Field Medical Treatment Protocols.
   6.1. Medical care in the field by EMT-Basic/Intermediate/Paramedic (B/I/P) will be guided

   (MCRP), and the EMS Medical Director.
   6.2. 88 MDOS/SGOE Enlisted EMS Coordinator will maintain active nonvoting
   membership in the GMVEMSC.
7. Transportation and Disposition Protocols.
   7.1. The GMVEMSC paramedic treatment protocols for EMS ambulance operations by 88
   MDOS/SGOE and 88 ABW/CEF are as follows:
      7.1.1. Patients received by on-base EMS 911-calls will be appropriately assessed by the
      lead paramedic on-scene. The paramedic, following protocol, with oversight from the ES
      Physician, will decide appropriate transport location. If the patient is unstable, they will
      be transported to the nearest hospital following GMVEMSC protocols. In the event the
 4                                                              WPAFBI44-201 13 MAY 2011
