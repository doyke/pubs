        addressee on all changes. ACC/A3 will include MAJCOM supplemental guidance in the
        next publication of the instruction.
1.4. Training.
     1.4.1. Aircrew training is designed to progress aircrews from Basic Qualification Training
     (BQT), to Mission Qualification Training (MQT), and finally to Continuation Training (CT).
     For crewmembers previously qualified, BQT is replaced by Re-qualification Training (RQT).
     1.4.2. BQT and RQT provide the training necessary to qualify aircrew in basic position and
     flying duties without regard to the unit’s mission. Upon completion of BQT or RQT, the
     crewmember attains Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. BAQ is a prerequisite for
     MQT. Except for General Officers, BAQ is not a long-term qualification status. Waiver
     authority for any aircrew, other than General Officers, to remain BAQ is MAJCOM/A3. In
     the event an individual is identified to remain in BAQ status, the Unit/CC will determine
     applicable ground and flight training requirements.
     1.4.3. MQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify or re-qualify aircrews in a
     specific position and flying duties to perform the missions assigned to a specific unit.
     Aircrews maintain BAQ status until completion of MQT. Completion of MQT is a
     prerequisite for BMC and CMR. Previously qualified U-2 instructor pilots, while entered in
     the RQT syllabus, may enter Instructor Pilot Upgrade (IPUG) prior to MQT, but will not
     instruct any mission specific topics (sensor operations, FOL operations, etc) until
     BMC/CMR. Those not previously qualified as U-2 IPs may enter IPUG training after
     completion of MQT.
     1.4.4. RAP is the CT program designed to focus training on capabilities needed to
     accomplish the unit’s core tasked missions. Following completion of MQT, a pilot will have
     received training in all of the core missions of the unit, unless exempted in Chapter 3. The
     crewmember will then be assigned to either a CMR or BMC position.
        1.4.4.1. CMR: The minimum training required for crew members to be qualified and
        proficient in all of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapons
        system.
        1.4.4.2. All Combat (CC-coded) unit active duty API-1 and flying SQ/CC and SQ/DO
        positions are designated CMR. OG/CCs may designate other API-6 positions not
        assigned to the flying squadron as CMR. (EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, the
        Unit/CC may elect to train the front line of the Unit Manning Document (UMD) API-1s
        to CMR and designate the overage BMC. In this case, priority should be given to
        inexperienced crewmembers, with at least 50%, if available, designated CMR). CMR
        crewmembers maintain proficiency and qualification in all core missions of the flying
        unit to which they are assigned or attached. CMR crewmembers maintain currencies,
        which affect CMR status, accomplish all core designated flight training (sorties and
        events), and accomplish all mission ground training. Failure to complete this training or
        maintain those currencies causes regression to Non-CMR (N-CMR) status. While N-
        CMR, crewmembers may not perform operational missions.
        1.4.4.3. BMC: The minimum training required for crew members to be familiarized in
        all, and possibly qualified and proficient in some, of the primary missions tasked to their
        assigned unit and weapons system.
AFI11-2U-2V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                         7


      1.4.4.4. All other (not CMR) active duty wing aircrew positions are designated BMC.
      Aircrews who have a primary job performing wing supervision or staff functions that
      directly support flight operations, or are FTU instructors or operational test aircrews fill
      BMC positions. However, these aircrews are required to provide additional sortie
      generation capability, either in lieu of or in addition to, the personnel assigned to the
      flying squadrons. BMC aircrews maintain familiarization with all unit core missions.
      BMC aircrews also maintain proficiency and qualification in some of the unit core
      missions. BMC crewmembers accomplish all applicable Category II ground training as
      required IAW Table 4.1.. Normally, BMC pilots will be trained to a CMR level prior to
      deploying for a flying TDY. Failure to complete BMC required training results in
      regression to Non-BMC (N-BMC) status. While N-BMC, crewmembers may not perform
      mission-oriented training without supervision until re-certified.
      1.4.4.5. N-CMR and N-BMC. Aircrews who regress to N-CMR or N-BMC status will
      accomplish a tailored program to regain CMR or BMC status as specified by the
      Unit/CC.
      1.4.4.6. Specialized training. Specialized training is training in any special skills
      necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned missions that are not required of every aircrew.
      Specialized training consists of upgrade training such as Instructor Pilot Upgrade (IPUG),
      Functional Check Flight (FCF), etc., as well as CT to maintain proficiency and
      qualification in unit special capabilities and missions. Specialized training is normally
      accomplished after a crewmember is assigned CMR or BMC status, and is normally in
      addition to CMR or BMC requirements. Unless otherwise specified, crewmembers in
      CMR or BMC positions may hold special capabilities or qualifications as long as any
      additional training requirements are accomplished.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies.
   1.5.1. Design training programs to achieve the highest degree of operational readiness and
   proficiency consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the
   need for realism against the expected threat, aircrew capabilities, and safety. This instruction
   provides training guidelines and policies to be used with operational procedures specified in
   applicable flying and operations publications.
   1.5.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (ACC/TRSS) will develop and validate training
   programs when tasked. Other MAJCOMS may submit requests for training program support
   to the ACC/A3. If validated, these requests will be prioritized and tasked to ACC/TRSS.
   Designated test units (CB-coded) may develop syllabi to upgrade Operational Test Aircrew
   in support of specific test plans. These syllabi will be approved by the OG/CC and submitted
   to ACC/TRSS.
   1.5.3. Design training missions to achieve operational capability in squadron tasked roles,
   maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RAP training
   missions should emphasize either basic mission skills or scenarios that reflect procedures and
   operations based on employment plans, collection requirements, location, current
   intelligence, and opposition capabilities. Use of procedures and actions applicable to
   operational scenarios is desired (e.g., appropriate use of code words, authentication
   procedures, safe recovery procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions,
   and intelligence briefing/debriefing).
 8                                                                  AFI11-2U-2V1 30 MAY 2012


     1.5.4. In-flight Supervision. Unless specifically directed, Unit/CC determines the level of
     supervision required to accomplish the required training. If mission objectives include
     introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, an instructor pilot (IP)
     may be required.
     1.5.5. Aircrews will not be required to accomplish ground or ancillary training except as
     required by this instruction and AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.
     1.5.6. The ACC aircrew training cycle is 12 months. Units will complete all training
     requirements during the appropriate training cycle unless specifically exempted.
1.6. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Policy and Management.
     1.6.1. Each qualification level (BMC/CMR) is defined by a total number of sorties, broken
     down into low RAP and high RAP sorties.
     1.6.2. The number of sorties is the primary factor for maintaining an individual’s
     qualification level. Qualification in a particular mission is determined by the Unit/CC,
     considering MAJCOM guidance and each individual’s capabilities.
     1.6.3. An effective RAP sortie is either a low or high sortie meeting the requirements
     outlined in Attachment 2. Operational reconnaissance missions are considered RAP events.
     1.6.4. The Unit/CC’s first priority should be to train all designated aircrews to CMR.
     1.6.5. Progression from BMC to CMR requires:
        1.6.5.1. Valid one (1)-month lookback at the CMR sortie rate.
            1.6.5.1.1. “Lookback” is a method through which pilots are ensured adequate
            frequency and recency of RAP events to achieve and/or reestablish CMR or BMC. A
            current lookback is established by the pilot accomplishing the required amount of
            RAP sorties during a one or three month time frame. On the date that a pilot has
            completed these required sorties, lookback has been established for that training
            month.
        1.6.5.2. Qualification in core missions and RAP events required at CMR.
        1.6.5.3. Confirmation that the progressed aircrew can complete a prorated number of
        sortie and event requirements for CMR by the end of the training cycle.
        1.6.5.4. Completion of mission-related ground training.
        1.6.5.5. Unit/CC certification.
     1.6.6. Unit/CCs will determine and assign crew members who will train for and maintain
     special capabilities or qualifications.
     1.6.7. End-of-Cycle training requirements are based on the aircrew member’s experience
     level on the last day of the current training cycle.
1.7. Training Sortie Program Development.
     1.7.1. RAP sortie and event requirements apply to BMC and CMR aircrews, as well as those
     carrying special capabilities or qualifications (see Attachment 2 for definitions). The sortie
     requirements in Table 4.2 establish the minimum number of RAP sorties per training cycle.
AFI11-2U-2V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                       9


1.8. Training Records and Reports.
   1.8.1. Units will maintain aircrew records for individual training and evaluations IAW
   applicable Air Force and MAJCOM directives.
   1.8.2. Track the following information for all pilots:
       1.8.2.1. Ground training.
       1.8.2.2. Requirements and cumulative individual sorties, RAP sorties, sortie types, and
       events accomplished for the training cycle.
       1.8.2.3. RAP requirements accomplished using 1-month and 3-month running totals for
       lookback.
       1.8.2.4. Currencies.
   1.8.3. Units may fill in ARMS “NO DATE” with either the date of the last FTU equivalent
   accomplished, or the unit mission certification date. Units will submit a mid-year report at
   the end of the sixth month of the annual training cycle documenting all incomplete training to
   ACC/A3C (info copy to NAF/A3). Prior to submitting the report, units are reminded to
   prorate incomplete training as detailed in Chapter 4 of this instruction. Reports will be
   submitted        using     the       guidance       and      examples       presented       at
   https://acc.eim.acc.af.mil/org/A3/A3C/A3CH/default.aspx and are due to ACC/A3C by 15
   April. Reasons training was not accomplished must be specified and whether failure to
   accomplish the training resulted in regression, retraining, or was waived by the OG/CC.
   Negative reports are required.
1.9. Aircrew Utilization Policy.
   1.9.1. Commanders will ensure wing or group tactical aircrews (API-1/6s) fill only
   authorized positions IAW unit manning documents and aircrew status is properly designated.
   The overall objective is for aircrew members to perform operationally related duties.
   Supervisors may assign crew members to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, FEB/mishap
   board member, etc.) but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of aircrew
   tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience. For inexperienced aircrews in the first
   year after completion of MQT, supervisors will limit the non-flying duties to those related to
   combat activities.
   1.9.2. Duties required by various publications which may be assigned to Combat Air Force
   (CAF) API-1 aircrews are: weapons and tactics officer, flying safety officer, SOF,
   mobility/contingency     plans,     training   (except     ARMS        documentation),     SQ
   Standardization/Evaluation Liaison Officer (SELO), squadron aircrew flight equipment
   officer, electronic combat officer, and other duties directly related to flying operations. In
   some instances, such as squadron-assigned flying safety officers, API-1s may be attached to
   the wing. API-1s will not be attached to wing staffs or man wing staff positions unless total
   wing aircrew API-1/6 manning is 100 percent or better. CCs will ensure wing staff aircrews
   (API-6s) perform duties justified in manpower standards documents and authorized in
   UMDs.
   1.9.3. Aircrew will not perform long-term duties which detract from their primary duties of
   training for, or performing, the unit’s flying missions. EXCEPTION: Aircrew members who
   are on long-term DNIF status or are suspended can perform such duties.
 10                                                            AFI11-2U-2V1 30 MAY 2012


1.10. Sortie Allocation Guidance.
   1.10.1. API-1 inexperienced pilots (INEXP) should receive sortie allocation priority over
   experienced pilots (EXP). Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows for:
      1.10.1.1. Formal training units: Formal syllabus training, instructor upgrade, instructor
      CT, authorized staff personnel not performing instructor or SEFE duties (to include API-
      5 flight surgeons).
      1.10.1.2. Combined formal training and operational units: Formal syllabus training,
      CMR/API-1,       MQT/API-1,    CMR/API-6,     MQT/API-6,     BMC,      API-5/flight
      surgeons/others.
      1.10.1.3. Operational units: CMR/API-1, MQT/API-1, CMR/API-6, MQT/API-6, and
      BMC (to include API-5 flight surgeons).
      1.10.1.4. USAF Weapons School (USAFWS), and Test & Evaluation Squadron (TES)
      Units: Requirements directed by MAJCOM, training required to prepare for assigned
      projects or tasking, BMC requirements that cannot be accomplished on primary missions,
      API-5 flight surgeons.
   1.10.2. Wing API-6 authorizations are IAW UMDs.
   1.10.3. For wings consisting of both FTU and operational units, it is highly desired one of
   the following maintain formal IP status in the U-2: WG/CC, WG/CV, OG/CC, or OG/CD.
   1.10.4. API-8 (above wing level) rated personnel flying authorizations will be IAW AFI 11-
   401 and MAJCOM guidance. They will fly the BMC rate, however they are not required to
   complete BMC specific missions or events, or meet monthly lookback requirements.
1.11. Waiver Authority.
   1.11.1. With MAJCOM/A3 approval, waiver authority for all RAP requirements and all
   provisions in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 of this volume is the OG/CC. Unless specifically
   noted otherwise in the appropriate section, and also with MAJCOM/A3 approval, the OG/CC
   may adjust individual requirements in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 on a case-by-case basis, to
   accommodate variations in aircrew member experience and performance. For all other
   provisions of this volume, and IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1, the waiver authority is the
   MAJCOM/A3. Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the
   supplement and approved through higher level coordination authority.
   1.11.2. Units will submit an annual report of all incomplete training to ACC/A3C (info copy
   to NAF/A3) by 15 October. Prior to submitting the annual report, units are reminded to
   prorate incomplete training as detailed in Chapter 4 of this instruction. Reports will be
   submitted        using      the      guidance       and      examples      presented      at
   https://acc.eim.acc.af.mil/org/A3/A3C/A3CH/default.aspx. Reasons training was not
   accomplished must be specified and whether failure to accomplish the training resulted in
   regression, retraining, or was waived by the OG/CC. Negative reports are required.

                          MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. Mission Qualification Training (MQT) is a unit training program that upgrades
aircrew who have completed BQT/RQT to BMC or CMR. MQT will train aircrews to
accomplish the unit mission. Units are allowed to tailor this program for all crew members,
based on experience, currency, documented performance, and formal training. Specific training
guidance, procedures, policy, and requirements for MQT are described in the U2MQT course
syllabus.
3.2. Training Completion. MQT is complete following initial conventional and RISNO
certification. Training will be completed within the time specified by the syllabus. Pilots will be
considered CMR following completion of MQT, Unit/CC certification, and meeting lookback.
Training sorties flown during any Qualification Training count towards the initial lookback.
AFI11-2U-2V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                        13

                                 CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. This chapter outlines ground and flying training requirements for CMR and BMC
   aircrews. Refer to Chapter 5 for additional training program specifics.
   4.1.2. Pilots must be qualified IAW AFI 11-202V1 and V2. Additionally, they must
   complete BQT, RQT, or SST to fly in BAQ status, and MQT to fly in BMC or CMR status.
4.2. Ground Training.
   4.2.1. The three categories of ground training are: Category I: Mobility, Category II:
   Aircrew, and Category III: Air Force Awareness/Ancillary Training Program. Ground
   training accomplished during BQT/RQT/SST/IPUG may be credited toward CT
   requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.
      4.2.1.1. Category I: Mobility. Required for all CMR aircrews. BMC aircrews require
      this training prior to an operational deployment. At Unit/CC discretion, BMC aircrews
      may maintain currency in some or all of this training to allow for short notice
      deployment. Failure to accomplish this training will affect CMR status as noted in Table
      4.1.
      4.2.1.2. Category II: Aircrew Ground Training. The following is required for all
      pilots.
          4.2.1.2.1. Certification. Crew members will accomplish a formal conventional
          mission certification and a formal RISNO certification prior to becoming CMR. MQT
          will culminate with the successful completion of both certifications. The conventional
          certification will precede the RISNO certification unless the 99RS/CC dictates
          otherwise. Certification topics are listed in Attachment 3.
                4.2.1.2.1.1. Conventional Certification.         The 99RS/CC or designated
                representative is the certifying official for the conventional certification board.
                Board should include Tactics, Intelligence and SERE representatives. The board
                should be conducted with the participation of the 548 IG, whenever possible.
                Each pilot will demonstrate to the certifying official and board members a
                satisfactory knowledge of the unit’s assigned conventional mission. BMC pilots
                may accomplish an initial certification or participate in a recertification to
                facilitate future upgrade to CMR status, at the discretion of the Unit/CC.
                   4.2.1.2.1.1.1. Initial and recurring certification training will incorporate
                   Intelligence/SERE, Elecontric Combat and Tactics, and must include: Threat
                   Knowledge, Evasion and Recovery, Collection and Reporting, and Current
                   Intelligence covering significant military and political developments in the
                   unit’s mission area of interest. When possible, Evasion and Recovery training
                   will be conducted by a SERE specialist.
                   4.2.1.2.1.1.2. The conventional recertification requirements must be met
                   every 12 months, and can be accomplished by attending the required academic
14                                                           AFI11-2U-2V1 30 MAY 2012


            training, attending an initial certification brief, or acting as an academic lesson
            briefer. Following the training, the 99RS/DO or a representative will chair a
            table-top session to complete the recertification.
        4.2.1.2.1.2. Reconnaissance In Support of Nuclear Operations (RISNO)
        Certification. The 9RW/CC or designated representative (9RW/CV, 9OG/CC or
        9OG/CD) is the certifying official for the RISNO board. The board should
        include Tactics, Intelligence and SERE representatives, and should be conducted
        with the participation of the 548 IG, whenever possible. The RISNO
        recertification requirements must be met every 18 months as a briefer or board
        member (FOL SQ/CCs may act as a RISNO board certifying official for
        recertifications). Continuation training (e.g. semiannual RISNO study) updates
        pilots on their unit’s RISNO mission. Initial and recurring certification training
        will incorporate Intelligence, Electronic Combat and Tactics Training. BMC
        pilots may accomplish an initial certification or participate in a recertification to
        facilitate future upgrade to CMR status, at the discretion of the Unit/CC.
     4.2.1.2.2. Stall Awareness CBT. Ground training should consist of U-2 aerodynamics
     in the stall region, stall awareness cues, proper stall recovery procedures, and a
     review of the hazards of stalls in the U-2.
     4.2.1.2.3. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT).
        4.2.1.2.3.1. This training is not an evaluation, but a review of abnormal
        procedures, emergency procedures, aircraft systems operations, and aircraft
        systems limitations during realistic scenarios. One crew member should present a
        situation and another discuss actions necessary to cope with the malfunction and
        carry it to a logical conclusion. SEPT is normally accomplished in a table-top
        discussion. Critical action procedures (if applicable) and unit special interest
        items should be emphasized.
        4.2.1.2.3.2. Incorporate the following elements into unit SEPT training programs:
            4.2.1.2.3.2.1. SQ/Det CC involvement in the selection of a monthly SEPT
            topic.
            4.2.1.2.3.2.2. Develop SEPT scenarios using U-2 mishaps or incidents as
            baseline cases.
            4.2.1.2.3.2.3. Discuss at least two emergency procedures for each phase of
            flight over the course of the monthly SEPT period.
            4.2.1.2.3.2.4. Accomplish two SEPT sessions each annual training period
            (one per semi-annual period) with an IP or unit supervisor to include
            minimum fuel and emergency divert training. These SEPT sessions must be
            conducted in the MPT (EXCEPTION: At U-2 FOLs where an MPT is not
            available, assigned pilots will accomplish the semi-annual SEPT via a table-
            top discussion or similar format).
        4.2.1.2.3.3. SEPT will be accomplished each calendar month. Failure to
        accomplish by the end of the month will result in grounding until subsequently
        completed.
AFI11-2U-2V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                        15


             4.2.1.2.3.4. IP/Student emergency procedures discussions satisfy the monthly
             SEPT requirement for the IP who administers this training.
      4.2.1.3. Category III: Air Force Awareness/Ancillary Training Program. This
      training is required for all Air Force personnel. The frequency of this training is listed in
      Table 4.1.
         4.2.1.3.1. US/Russian Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities. Initial, annual
         refresher and pre-deployment (if applicable) training for the Prevention of Dangerous
         Military Activities will be conducted to ensure all pilots are familiar with the
         agreement and the implementing provisions. Training requires review of the
         “Procedures for the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities Between US and
         Russia” section of the Flight Information Handbook.

2. For individuals deployed longer than 120 days (e.g. 179-day or 365-day TDYs), sortie rate
(lookback) should be applied using “CMR no CTP” column.

4.4. Special Categories.
   4.4.1. Flight Surgeon (FS). FS flying rates and requirements will be IAW AFI 11-401.
   Assigned/attached flight surgeons are authorized one flight annually in the two-seat TU-2S.
   4.4.2. MAJCOM and NAF API-8 Crew members:
       4.4.2.1. Mission Directed Training (MDT) for HHQ personnel (other than that conducted
       in support of a formal inspection) requires coordination with the supporting unit.
       MAJCOM Directors (Division Chiefs for Flight Safety and IG) and NAF/A3 are
       reviewing authorities for assigned personnel. They will:
           4.4.2.1.1. Coordinate with the supporting agency to ensure appropriate ARMS data is
           maintained and provided IAW AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management.
           4.4.2.1.2. Review assigned pilot accomplishments and currencies prior to authorizing
           them to participate in MDT.
           4.4.2.1.3. Provide each pilot with written documentation specifying the sortie types
           and events he is authorized to fly.
       4.4.2.2. HHQ pilots maintaining BMC status are required to accomplish ground training
       as required by Table 4.1. Specific currencies will be provided to the host unit and HHQ
       supervisors will determine pilot qualifications to participate in unit scenarios for MDT.
       4.4.2.3. Pilots will:
           4.4.2.3.1. Review accomplishments and currencies for accuracy.
           4.4.2.3.2. Submit qualification and authorization documentation to the supporting
           unit/CC or operations officer prior to flying with that unit.
           4.4.2.3.3. Evaluate the demands of each mission scenario and ensure that their ability
           and proficiency will not be exceeded.
       4.4.2.4. Instructor-qualified pilots may perform instructor duties with the concurrence of
       the Unit/CC, if qualified and current for the applicable missions/events.
4.5. Multiple Qualification/Currency.
   4.5.1. MAJCOM/A3 may authorize qualification in more than one mission design series
   (MDS) aircraft for aircrews only when such action is directed by command mission
   requirements and is economically justifiable. This authority cannot be delegated below
   MAJCOM level. Commanders must not permit crewmembers qualified in primary mission
   aircraft to maintain qualification in support aircraft unless required for unit mission
   accomplishment. Individuals assigned to positions covered by paragraph 4.5.2 have
   MAJCOM/A3 approval, and do not need to submit specific requests.
       4.5.1.1. Submit multiple qualification requests through command channels to MAJCOM
       A3T/A3C. All requests must contain full justification. Approval for multiple qualification
       request must be provided to the appropriate host base flight management office (HARM).
AFI11-2U-2V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                       21


      Flight accomplishments are not authorized until aircraft assignment is updated into
      ARMS.
      4.5.1.2. Individually authorized multiple qualifications are valid as long as the individual
      is assigned to the specific position and aircraft requested, or until rescinded by
      MAJCOM/A3.
   4.5.2. Multiple qualification is authorized as follows and does not require specific
   authorization:
      4.5.2.1. U-2 pilots participating in the Companion Trainer Program (CTP) or maintaining
      qualification in the applicable companion trainer aircraft.
      4.5.2.2. The U-2S and TU-2S are considered the same MDS.
   4.5.3. Multiple qualification is not appropriate for senior wing supervisors of units with
   different types of mission aircraft. Wing Commanders will qualify in only one of their wing’s
   mission aircraft (e.g. U-2, RQ-4 or MC-12). Either the Wing/CV or OG/CC should qualify in
   another of the wing’s mission aircraft (not the same one selected by the WG/CC). The 9RW
   senior wing leadership should all qualify in the T-38 companion trainer when feasible
   (EXCEPTION: pilots qualified in the RQ-4 as their primary aircraft (i.e. whose Aeronautical
   Order authorizes performance of duties in remotely piloted aircraft) require a waiver to
   obtain/maintain qualification in the T-38). See MAJCOM guidance for policy on Senior
   Supervisor Familiarization Flights, and ACC Syllabus U2SST.
   4.5.4. U-2 pilots dual qualified in the T-38 under the provisions of the Companion Trainer
   Program, will be qualified and current IAW AFI 11-202V1 as supplemented. Use the “With
   companion trainer” column in applicable training tables and complete both MDS annual
   training requirements in full. (Exception: for pilots deployed for more than 120 days (e.g.
   179-day or 365-day TDYs) use the “CMR no CTP” column.)
4.6. Currencies/Recurrencies/Requalification.
   4.6.1. Currency. Table 4.3 defines currency requirements for all U-2 pilots. If a pilot loses a
   particular currency, that sortie or event may not be performed except for the purpose of
   regaining currency as noted. Loss of U-2 event currency not exceeding six months does not
   affect overall qualification, but may require regression to N-CMR/N-BMC.
   4.6.2. Recurrency.
      4.6.2.1. Recurrency is required whenever a crewmember does not meet a currency
      requirement in this instruction.
      4.6.2.2. Overdue training requirements must be satisfied before the pilot is considered
      qualified to perform tasks applicable to that type of training. Training annotated as
      affecting CMR status will require regression to N-CMR until appropriate training as
      specified by Unit/CC is accomplished.
      4.6.2.3. Unless otherwise specified, supervisory requirements pertaining to recurrency
      may be satisfied in the flight position that offers the best control of the mission or in a
      mobile vehicle, as determined by the Unit/CC.
   4.6.3. Loss of IP Status and Requalification. IPs will be decertified if:
 22                                                                AFI11-2U-2V1 30 MAY 2012


       4.6.3.1. They fail a flight check. To regain instructor status, a pilot must successfully
       complete a flight check IAW AFI 11-202V2.
       4.6.3.2. They fail a qualification, instrument, or tactical written examination. To regain
       instructor status, a pilot must successfully re-accomplish the written exam.
       4.6.3.3. They become non-current in an event or sortie which causes removal from CMR
       or BMC status and the Unit/CC deems that the loss of currency is of sufficient
       importance to require decertification. If the Unit/CC does not elect this option or if the
       instructor becomes non-current in events or sorties which do not require removal from
       CMR or BMC status, instructor status may be retained, but the individual will not instruct
       in that event or sortie until the required currency is regained.
   4.6.4. Mobile Currency/Recurrency.
       4.6.4.1. With OG/CC approval, U-2 pilots who lose flying currency due to extenuating
       circumstances (e.g. long-term DNIF) may continue to perform mobile duties provided
       mobile currency as defined in Table 4.3 is maintained. If mobile currency is lost,
       recurrency requirements will be determined by the unit operations officer. This
       paragraph will only be applied on an individual/case-by-case basis, cannot be applied as
       blanket approval, and approval will be documented in writing. Approval will not be
       delegated below the OG/CD level.
       4.6.4.2. With Top 3 approval, U-2 IPs may provide instruction from the chase vehicle in
       events for which their own currency has expired.

NOTES:
1. For all events update currency by flying the event. Regain lost currency by flying the event
under instructor supervision from a mobile vehicle or in the aircraft. Loss of currency less
than six months does not affect overall qualification.
2. IPs will not perform landing phase instruction without rear seat currency. Currency may be
updated on any sortie under the supervision of a qualified Mobile Officer with Unit CC/DO
approval.
3. While deployed to an FOL for a flying TDY, these currencies do not effect BMC/ CMR
status for 90 days from the date last accomplished. This may be waived up to 120 days by 9
OG/CC.
4. If night landing currency is lost, it cannot be regained on an operational mission. To regain
night landing currency, the requirements of a night sortie and night landing as listed in
Attachment 1 must be met in the U-2.
5. Mobile recurrency requires supervision of one takeoff and landing in the chase vehicle by a
qualified, mobile-current U-2 IP.

4.7. Regression.
   4.7.1. CMR/BMC Regression for Failure to Meet Lookback. If a pilot does not meet
   lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, commanders can (1) regress the pilot to
   N-CMR or N-BMC, as applicable, (2) remove him from a CMR manning position, (3) place
   the pilot on probation or (3) initiate action to remove the pilot from active flying status.
       4.7.1.1. Failure to meet the 1-month lookback requires a review of the pilot’s 3-month
       sortie history. If the 3-month lookback has been met, pilots may, at Unit/CC discretion,
       remain CMR or BMC. Failure to meet lookback will result in regression to N-CMR or N-
       BMC, as appropriate, or the pilot may be placed on probation status for one additional
       month at the Unit/CC discretion. If probation is chosen, the only way to remove a pilot
       from probation is to complete the sortie requirements that establish a 1-month lookback.
       Pilots currently holding probationary status will not normally deploy and any deviation
       requires OG/CC approval. While deployed to an FOL for a flying TDY, lookback can be
       satisfied by any combination of RAP (high or low) sorties.
       4.7.1.2. For pilots regressed to N-BMC or N-CMR for lookback, the Unit/CC will
       approve a tailored program to bring the pilot up to applicable standards. Upon completion
       of the re-certification program, the pilot must also meet the 1-month lookback
       requirements prior to reclaiming CMR or BMC status. The sorties and events
 24                                                               AFI11-2U-2V1 30 MAY 2012


       accomplished during the recertification may be credited towards the total sortie and event
       requirements for the training cycle as well for the monthly sortie requirement.
   4.7.2. Pilots who fail an aircraft qualification, mission, or instrument evaluation will be
   handled IAW AFI 11-202V2. They will regress to N-CMR or N-BMC as applicable. They
   will remain N-CMR or N-BMC until successfully completing required corrective action, a
   re-evaluation, and are re-certified by the Unit/CC.
4.8. End-of-Cycle Training Requirements. Pilots who fail to complete sortie or event
requirements of this instruction by the end of the training cycle may require additional training,
depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency. The pilot is able to continue CMR or
BMC as determined by lookback. The Unit/CC will determine if additional training is required.
If additional training is required, the pilot will be regressed to a N-CMR or N-BMC status until
the tailored training program is complete and a 1-month lookback is established. Refer to
paragraph 4.9 for proration guidance. In all cases, report training shortfalls IAW paragraph
1.11.
4.9. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the Unit/CC
may prorate any training requirements when DNIFs, emergency leaves, non-flying TDY, or
exercises preclude training for a portion of the training period. Normal annual leave will not be
considered as non-availability. Extended bad weather which precludes the unit from flying for
more than 15 consecutive days may be considered as non-availability. The following guidelines
apply:
   4.9.1. Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training
   nonavailability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
   4.9.2. Proration is normally based upon periods of consecutive days of non-availability for
   flying. Use Table 4.4 to determine the number of “Months of Proration Allowed” for each
   period of non-availability. Proration is cumulative over the training cycle (add “Months of
   Proration Allowed” for each non-availability period for total training cycle proration - refer
   to example in paragraph 4.9.4). Adding non-availability periods that do not individually
   meet the proration threshold (16 days) may be considered, but final proration must be
   approved by Unit/CC.
   4.9.3. If BQT is re-accomplished, a pilot’s training cycle will start over at a prorated share
   following completion of MQT training.
   4.9.4. EXAMPLE. Capt Jones was granted 17 days of emergency leave in January and
   attended SOS in residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days. His
   Unit/CC authorized a total of three months proration from his training cycle (one month for
   emergency leave and two months for SOS).
   4.9.5. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next
   lower whole number, but no requirement may be prorated below one as shown in Table 4.4.
   4.9.6. Newly assigned pilots and pilots achieving CMR or BMC after the 15th of the month
   are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration purposes.
   Events and sorties for the remainder of the training cycle may be prorated. A prorated share
   of RAP sorties must be completed in CT.
AFI11-2U-2V1 30 MAY 2012                                                                          25


   4.9.7. A pilot’s last month on station prior to departing PCS may be prorated. Individuals
   departing PCS may be considered CMR for reporting purposes during a period of 60 days
   from date of last flight, or until loss of CMR currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty
   station.

4.10. Example of the Lookback, Regression, Proration, and Requalification Process.
   4.10.1. Capt Smith is an experienced CMR U-2 pilot (with CTP) with a 1-month lookback
   requirement of 1 low sortie, and 1 high sortie, plus one other sortie (low or high) for a total of
   3 RAP sorties. His 3-month lookback requirement is 3 lows and 2 highs, plus 2 other sorties
   (low or high) for a total of 7 RAP sorties. On Feb 3, he flew a low sortie prior to departing
   for a non-flying TDY for 2 months. He reported back for flight duty on 6 Apr. What is his
   status throughout his TDY and on his return?
   4.10.2. The Unit/CC wanted to list Capt Smith as a countable CMR crewmember for
   reporting purposes throughout the TDY. Therefore, on 1 Mar, his Flt/CC performed the
   mandatory 1-month lookback (Feb) on Capt Smith. He failed this, having flown one RAP
   sortie. The Flt/CC then performed a 3-month lookback (Dec, Jan, Feb). This showed that he
   flew 4 lows and 2 highs for a total of 6 sorties. Had he flown 1 more RAP sortie, his Unit/CC
   could have continued Capt Smith at CMR. However, with only 6 total RAP sorties, Capt
   Smith did not meet the 3-month lookback for CMR. The Unit/CC could regress Capt Smith
   to N-CMR, but instead elected to put him on probation, still carrying him as CMR.

   4.10.3. On 1 Apr, Capt Smith’s 1-month lookback (Mar) was zero sorties. The Unit/CC must
   now regress Capt Smith to N-CMR. Upon his return 6 Apr, he must be placed in a re-
   certification program.
   4.10.4. At the end of the 12 month training cycle, the Unit/CC prorated two months off of
   Capt Smith’s total requirements. In spite of this proration, Capt Smith was deficient by one
   high sortie and two low sorties. Capt Smith may be retained as CMR or regressed to N-CMR
   at the discretion of the Unit/CC. In any case, report the training shortfalls IAW paragraph
   1.11.

Terms
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—The status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed training (MQT) prescribed to perform the unit mission but who does not maintain
CMR status. Crewmember accomplishes training required to remain familiarized in all, and may
be qualified and proficient in some, of the primary missions of their weapon system and unit.
Basic Qualification Training (BQT)—Training to qualify the aircrew in basic aircraft flying
duties. For U-2s, the basic aircraft flying duties are for solo flight without specific regard to the
unit’s operational mission.
Certification—The process of certifying aircrew tactical employment and special weapons
capabilities, procedures, and rules. (Note: Applies to aircrew tactical employment knowledge,
including conventional and RISNO missions. Certification is conducted in both initial and
follow-on phases. Initial certification is a formal board proceeding convened to verify individual
aircrew knowledge. Continuation training is to reinforce, refresh, and update aircrews on unit
mission/tasking, tactics, and procedures).
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—A status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed training (MQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational
missions, and maintains qualification and proficiency in these missions.
Computer Based Training (CBT)—Use of computers to teach crewmembers U-2 systems
operations.
Continuation Training (CT)—Training to maintain proficiency and improve aircrew
capabilities to perform unit missions and aircrew proficiency sorties not flown in formal syllabus
missions, tests, or evaluations. Applicable to BMC and CMR aircrews.
Currency—The minimum frequency required to perform an event or sortie safely.
Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE)—An evaluation of aircrew knowledge and
responsiveness to critical and non-critical emergency procedures conducted by a SEFE in an
MPT, aircraft cockpit, or by oral ground evaluation (should only be used when circumstances
preclude use of any of the above).
Experience Levels—Differentiation of U-2 pilots as either experienced or inexperienced

with the pilot.
Mission Accomplishment Report (MAR)—Computer generated product or form used to
schedule and record the accomplishment of continuation training events.
Mission Procedures Trainer (MPT)—A training device in which instruments and displays are
activated to respond to trainee inputs. Used for safety of flight, instrument, normal, and
emergency procedures.
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training required to achieve a basic level of
competence in unit’s primary tasked missions. This training is a prerequisite for BMC or CMR
status.
Mobile Officer—Qualified individual who provides safety of flight oversight and needed aid to
the mission crew.
Night Sortie—Night time is that time logged between the end of evening civil twilight and the
beginning of morning civil twilight, as published in the American Air Almanac. Night time may
be logged on a high, low or CTP sortie. As a minimum, a night sortie will include one of the
following:
Night Sortie(1)—Flight time of at least 1 hour when night time may be logged.
Night Sortie(2)—3 landings accomplished during the period when night time may be logged.
Mobile Vehicle—Chase vehicle operated by the Mobile Officer who provides safety of flight
and needed aid to the mission crew.
Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI)—Aircraft authorized for performance of the
operational mission. The PMAI forms the basis for allocation of operating resources to include
manpower, support equipment, and flying-hour funds. The operating command determines the
PMAI required to meet their assigned missions.
Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Event—A combat-oriented training event that can be linked to
aircrew readiness to accomplish assigned operational mission(s). RAP ties flying training events
and combatant commander requirements together to focus unit training on its assigned/tasked
missions.
Requalification Training (RQT)—Training/Training Program necessary to requalify a pilot to
BAQ.

Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT)—A review of abnormal procedures,
emergency procedures, aircraft systems operations and limitations based on realistic scenarios.
This training is not an evaluation, but a review of abnormal and emergency procedures and
aircraft system operations and limitations during realistic scenarios. One pilot should present the
situation and the other discuss actions necessary to cope with the malfunction and carry it to a
logical conclusion. Discuss at least two EPs per phase of flight during the SEPT session,
emphasizing any special interest items. SEPT training will be accomplished each calendar
month. Failure to accomplish by end of calendar month will result in grounding until
subsequently completed. Accomplish SEPT with IP sessions by the end of every sixth calendar
month in the MPT (if available) and include emergency divert training. If an MPT is not
available (such as at a forward operating location), SEPTs will be accomplished one-on-one.
Completion of a simulator EP profile satisfies the monthly SEPT requirement. Formal course
student SEPTs may satisfy the monthly SEPT requirement for the IP who administers this
training.
Squadron Supervisor—Squadron Commander, Operations Officer, Assistant Operations
Officers, and Flight CCs.
Tactical Deception—Any activity designed to mislead the enemy operational commander by
manipulating, distorting, or falsifying evidence, thereby inducing the enemy to act in a manner
favorable to our interests or desires.
Training Accomplishment Progress Report (TAPR)—Computer generated or locally
developed form used to schedule or record accomplishment of training events. It will be used for
crewmembers in any qualification or upgrade phases of training.

                         GLOSSARY OF EVENT DESCRIPTIONS

A2.1. U-2 RAP Sorties: Note: Unless otherwise specified in these event descriptions, units will
determine the necessary parameters for fulfilling and/or logging tasked events.
   A2.1.1. High Sortie: For the U-2: a sortie flown above FL 600. Must include at least one
   RAP Event listed in Table 4.2. Training sorties are generally considered “effective” if the
   pilot(s) have flown at least 2+00, updated all required or expired training events and
   completed all other critical briefed objectives. A high sortie can also be logged on an
   Operational Check Flight (OCF), Functional Check Flight (FCF) or an actual sensor
   employment sortie provided at least one of the RAP events listed in Table 4.2 is
   accomplished.
   A2.1.2. Low Sortie: For the U-2, a sortie flown below FL 450. Generally considered
   “effective” if the pilot flew at least 45 minutes single-seat (or 1 hour dual), updated all
   required or expired training events and completed all other critical briefed objectives.
   A2.1.3. Ineffective Sortie: Training sortie is ineffective if it did not meet the definition of
   “effective sortie”. Does not count towards RAP sortie requirements.
A2.2. U-2 Events:
   A2.2.1. INS Exercise. Training in the use of navigation systems. Consists of various
   combinations of the following: inflight alignment (IFA), entry and execution of an RPLAN,
   file transfer(s), Destination Point (DP) manual entry, use of multiple steering modes, orbit
   entry and steering, ETA control and sequential track steering.
   A2.2.2. Evasive Maneuver: Tactical turns above FL 600 as defined by Air Force Tactics,
