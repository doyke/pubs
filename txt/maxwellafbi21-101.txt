This instruction implements AFI 21-101/AETC Supplement 1, Aerospace Equipment
Maintenance Management. It prescribes Test Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE)
handling, mission essential/emergency calibration, processing, customer procedures, and Time
Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) procedures. Ensure all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) (available at https://webrims.amc.af.mil). This instruction applies to all
Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) customers.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change: updates the OPR and Certifying Authority, hours of operation, publication
titles, and office symbols; removes references no longer applicable to the program; adds
commercial contact numbers; and updates guidance for TMDE Coordinators.
1. Terms Explained. TMDE are devices used to maintain, evaluate, measure, calibrate, test,
inspect, diagnose, or otherwise examine materials, supplies, equipment, and systems to identify
or isolate actual potential malfunction, or decide if they meet operational specifications
established in technical documents.
   1.1. There are three types of TMDE that may or may not require calibration by the Precision
   Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL):
       1.1.1. Mission Equipment. Part of operational ground or airborne systems.

        1.1.2. Support Equipment (SE). A broad category of equipment and tools used to verify
        and maintain mission equipment. Support equipment can include equipment used to
        verify the operation of other support equipment.
        1.1.3. Non-TMDE. SE not meeting the TMDE definition. This equipment does not
        require calibration and is the responsibility of the user.
2. Responsibilities. Commanders and supervisors of all activities owning and using TMDE
requiring calibration are responsible to ensure TMDE is not used unless it has been calibrated.
     2.1. The 42 ABW PMEL will coordinate identification of a user’s TMDE requirements. The
     PMEL is located at Gunter Annex (Bldg 1513), 725 McDonald Street, 36114-3011. Hours of
     operation are from 0700 to 1600, Monday through Friday, normal government holidays
     excluded. Hours for pick-up and drop off of TMDE are 0700-1100. Pick-up and drop off of
     test equipment may be done later if coordinated with the scheduler in advance. Points of
     contact are:
        2.1.1. Scheduling: DSN 596-3999, Comm. 334-416-3999
        2.1.2. PMEL Manager: DSN 596-3998, Comm. 334-416-3998
        2.1.3. PMEL Quality Assurance (PQA): DSN 596-3999, Comm. 334-416-3999
        2.1.4. Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) (Government): DSN 596-5397
     2.2. Scheduling is the focal point on all matters pertaining to the support of TMDE.
     Scheduling will research TMDE to determine if it is Mission Equipment, SE or non-TMDE.
     2.3. Each owner (user) of TMDE needs to bring the item to the PMEL Scheduler for
     calibration determination. (Calling ahead to set an appointment is the preferable method).
     The following information should be provided to the Scheduler to assist in this
     determination:
        2.3.1. Part number of TMDE item in question.
        2.3.2. Federal Stock Number (FSN) of item, if known.
        2.3.3. Serial number on item. If no serial number can be located, Scheduling will assign
        one.
        2.3.4. Information concerning any accessories that are required to operate the item
        2.3.5. Information on whether the item is part of an airborne system or an operational
        ground support system (i.e. F-16, F-15, PATEC, etc).
     2.4. Transportation of TMDE to/from the PMEL is the owner’s responsibility. For TMDE
     that cannot be transported to the PMEL, call Scheduling to coordinate inspection of the item.
     The following procedures for transporting TMDE, although not all inclusive, should be
     followed.
        2.4.1. TMDE should be handled as “delicate instruments.”
        2.4.2. External cords, cables, accessories, and special connectors shall be secured to the
        case before movement.
        2.4.3. All unmated connectors shall be kept covered with moisture-proof caps. Unmated
        connectors on TMDE that contain circuitry susceptible to ESD damage shall be covered

     with conductive caps (TO 00-25-234, General Shop Practice Requirements for the
     Repair, Maint and Test of Electrical Equipment (ATOS), paragraph 7.5d(12)(d)).
     2.4.4. Metal-to-metal contact between TDME items shall be avoided unless the total
     instrument is contained in a protective case.
     2.4.5. Use a regularly assigned and specifically configured vehicle to prevent excessive
     shock, vibration and exposure to the elements when transporting TMDE.
     2.4.6. When in doubt, call the PMEL Scheduler concerning specific transportation
     requirement for your TMDE.
  2.5. Items identified TMDE will have the following actions taken by Scheduling:
     2.5.1. Assign a PMEL Automated Management (PAMS) ID number.
     2.5.2. Affix an ID label (AFTO Form 66, TMDE) to item.
     2.5.3. Assign an Owner Work Center(OWC) code.
     2.5.4. Schedule item in PAMS for calibration.
  2.6. Requests for emergency or priority calibration must be in writing (may be hand written
  to prevent delay) and are submitted to the PMEL Manager. Requests will not be honored
  unless they meet the following:
     2.6.1. Emergency calibration may only be requested for TMDE where loss of life, work
     stoppage, or mission failure WILL result.
     2.6.2. Priority calibration may only be requested if TMDE being unavailable MIGHT
     result in work stoppage or mission failure.
  2.7. Emergency calibration requests, after normal duty hours, need to be routed through the
  Command Post at Ext 953-7333. Command Post will notify QAE of request, whom in turn
  will verify request, ensure contracting office will approve of overtime work and then notify
  the PMEL Manager.
  2.8. PMEL Manager will coordinate delivery of emergency TMDE with customer and
  ensure all emergency calibrations are worked around the clock until complete. Customers
  requesting emergency calibration must provide PMEL Manager with 24-hour point of
  contact for notification/coordination actions.
  2.9. Priority calibration TMDE will be placed in work within 2 hours of arrival at the PMEL.
  Priority calibration TMDE will only be worked during normal duty hours of the PMEL.
  2.10. TMDE requiring Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) modifications must be
  identified to the Scheduler before delivery to the PMEL. Early identification of TCTO to
  scheduling will enable timely coordination with respective supply organizations to ensure
  materials are on hand to meet compliance. TCTO’s will be performed only by qualified
  PMEL technicians. It is the customer’s responsibility to return any TCTO directed materials
  to their respective supply organization.
  2.11. Each owner of TMDE will assign a TMDE Coordinator and Alternate TMDE
  Coordinator by appointment letter (IAW TO 00-20-14, AF Metrology and Calibration
  Program, paragraph 3.6). A copy of the appointment letter must be sent to the Gunter PMEL
