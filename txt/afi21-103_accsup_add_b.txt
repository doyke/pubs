Summary of Changes

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
Modifications have been accomplished to increase capability and overcome obsolescence issues
such as, TCTO 1B-1B-1364, Installation of Digital Communication Improvement, and TCTO
1B-1B-1378, Installation of Laptop Controlled Targeting Pod. Also line items were added to

further clarify aircraft lighting requirements, explosive devices/components and electronic
countermeasures (ECM) systems.
1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground
work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential systems
and subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime,
training, test or other missions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in Status of Resources
and Training reporting only and denotes Mission Capable (MC) aircraft capable of being
configured for a contingency mission in accordance with COMACC OMNIBUS Plan.
1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex degraded
mission systems such as suspension equipment.
1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment. The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC. A
Not Mission Capable aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can be
configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
Command differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another
MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify the unit's
requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
1.4. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by Work Unit Code
(WUC) against the Full System List (FSL) and all applicable Basic System Lists (BSLs) across
the page. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines applicability
of BSL columns. The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft; therefore, it is
important to compare only those columns listed in the MESL which are applicable to the unit's
assigned aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime) coded aircraft would determine and
report status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to their DOC statement. Units with
TF (training) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and Training
(TNG) columns, and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would determine and report status using
only the FSL and Test (TST) columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is
reported using the MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code.
