SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Significant changes throughout the instruction. Theater Battle Management Core System
(TBMCS) has been replaced by Unit Level/Unit Command and Control (UL/UC2). Processes
on how recalls of all levels have been revised. Types of battle staff recalls have been further
explained with updated verbiage. Wing recall reporting standards are changed. Formatting of
recall guidance is better streamlined and arranged in generally a sequential order. Readiness
Postures (RP) in relation to recalls have been added. Depictions and tables providing quick
reference are included. Attachments have been updated IAW to parent documents or based on
unit/Wing staff feedback.
1. General. 552d Air Control Wing Commander (552 ACW/CC) or designated representative
will direct recall of 552 ACW personnel as required. A recall may be executed in the event of
national or local emergency, increased Defense Condition (DEFCON), implementation of Higher
Headquarters (HHQ) or 552 ACW plans, execution of HHQ inspections, or locally-generated
recall exercises. Unit recalls can be initiated as required by the appropriate subordinate
commanders.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. Commanders will:
        2.1.1. Appoint a recall coordinator who will be responsible for consolidating strength
        data and reporting it as outlined in paragraph 4.
        2.1.2. Ensure their respective Group Control Centers/Unit Control Centers
        (GCCs/UCCs) are staffed and trained to implement recall procedures accurately and in a
        timely manner IAW this ACWI and higher governing instructions.
        2.1.3. Establish procedures to govern their unit’s recall programs.
        2.1.4. Ensure unit members understand the importance of safeguarding their recall roster
        as critical information (CI) and of properly destroying obsolete rosters. Recall rosters
        are not to be used as social rosters. Guidance for social rosters is available in Air Force
        Instruction (AFI) 33-332, Privacy Act Program, para 12.1.1.
     2.2. GCCs/UCCs are or will:
        2.2.1. Be primarily responsible for implementing recall procedures, accounting for all
        required personnel, and reporting status.
        2.2.2. Upon a General or Selective Recall, ensure all personnel report to work with their
        personal mobility bag (MOBAG), as required (see Attachment 3). It is highly
        advantageous for the GCCs/UCCs to activate as soon as possible in preparation for
        deployment operations to ensure accurate accounting and reporting of personnel.
        2.2.3. Activate and use Unit Level/Unit Command and Control (UL/UC2) to notify
        Battle Staff (BS) of activation as soon as possible after arriving at their work centers. The
        primary means of notification will be via NIPR DCO Jabber chat. Secondary means will
        be telephonic notification. All members will use the format of, organizational symbol,
        DSN telephone number, rank and name to allow more effective DCO user identification.
        Example: 963 AACS/DOR, 884-1234. SSgt John Brown. DCO chat will use the following
552ACWI10-202 5 MARCH2014                                                                        3


     rooms: 552 ACW GCC (Wing Staff and Groups only). All other players will use 552
     ACW gcc/ucc.
  2.3. Unit Recall Coordinators (URC) will:
     2.3.1. Develop telephone and degraded communications recall rosters (also known as
     comm out recall roster).
         2.3.1.1. Unit Deployment Managers should be listed at the top of the recall roster so
         they are among the first to be called.
         2.3.1.2. Rosters must be labeled with a caveat to advise individuals that “This Roster
         Contains Personal Information and Is For Official Use Only.” Use a Privacy Act
         Statement of 1974 Applies on all personnel rosters as prescribed in DODR 5400.7/Air
         Force Supplement, DOD Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program.
         2.3.1.3. Rosters will be destroyed (i.e., burned, shredded, etc.) when obsolete.
         Destroy electronic records by any means to prevent unauthorized transmission or
         duplication.
         2.3.1.4. Under FOIA, military and civilian personnel may exclude unlisted numbers
         from the printed roster. However, all members should be encouraged to include their
         information to ensure mission accomplishment. Unlisted telephone numbers listed on
         the roster must be annotated with “unlisted” or “UL”. If a member has all unlisted
         number(s), identify another individual or supervisor who can be notified, who will, in
         turn, notify the required individual. Example: John Brown, home phone unlisted.
         Notify John Doe, 555-1234. It is the unit recall coordinator’s responsibility to ensure
         the notifying individual or supervisor’s availability (i.e. deployed, crew rest or flying)
         and include an alternate if not available.
         2.3.1.5. Units will ensure each member has a copy of the recall roster and
         understands the unit’s recall procedures. The URC will ensure a copy of the recall
         roster is maintained in the unit’s command section.
         2.3.1.6. At a minimum, the recall quick reference in Attachment 3 will be located
         somewhere on the recall roster. Any deviations from Attachment 3 will be approved
         by 552 ACW/XP.
         2.3.1.7. Rosters will be annotated with date and time of last update to alleviate
         confusion on information currency.
         2.3.1.8. Alternates to organizational supervisors must be able to implement the recall
         roster for their organization in the absence of the supervisor.
     2.3.2. Review recall rosters for accuracy at least monthly and/or as changes occur.
     2.3.3. Email a copy of the updated recall roster to 552acw.cp@tinker.af.mil. Recall
     rosters are due to 552 ACW/CP by the 15th of every month or the first duty day after
     changes take place.
     2.3.4. Train all unit personnel on the use of the recall roster and recall procedures.
     Ensure unit leadership personnel know the processes for keeping recall rosters current.
 4                                                              552ACWI10-202 5 MARCH 2014


        2.3.5. Ensure recall rosters include key civilian personnel and IMAs. IMAs and civilians
        do not have to be recalled for alert notifications tests and exercises unless essential to the
        unit’s mission. Recall rosters can be annotated so these individuals are not recalled for
        exercises or notification tests.
     2.4. 552 ACW/XP will:
        2.4.1. Update and maintain a list of the Senior Battle Staff (SBS) and the Full Battle
        Staff (FBS) members and alternates. This list will include current addresses and
        telephone numbers and will be verified on a monthly basis. Wing XP will distribute the
        rosters monthly. The 552 ACW/CP is a required distribution recipient.
        2.4.2. Ensure all appointed Battle Staff members (SBS and FBS) inform 552 ACW/XP
        and 552 ACW/CP any time their contact information changes, a new person is assigned
        that position, or when the member will be unavailable due to absence (TDY, leave, etc.)
        2.4.3. Inform CP of any discrepancies found during recall procedures upon completion
        of recall.
2.5. 552 ACW/CP will:
        2.5.1. Create and utilize checklists to conduct BS recalls IAW this instruction and AFI
        10-207. Automated notifications, such as TANS (Telephone Automatic Notification
        System), may be utilized for recalls. The automated notification system will be verified
        on a monthly basis. CP will make verbal contact with key personnel who are not on the
        automated notification system.
        2.5.2. Review SBS and FBS rosters provided by Wing XP and update contact or
        procedures accordingly.
        2.5.3. Provide to Wing XP results of initiated recalls.
        2.5.4. Maintain copies of 552 ACW recall rosters for all Wing, Group and Squadron
        levels and update CP checklists, status boards, and recall roster binders.
        2.5.5. Execute any recall initiated by 552 ACW/CC, 552 ACW/CV or designated
        personnel.
     2.6. All personnel have the individual responsibility to ensure his/her contact information on
     recall rosters is accurate at all times and notify leadership as soon as it changes.
3. Execution.
     3.1. General.
        3.1.1. All 552 ACW recalls will be initiated by 552 ACW/CC, 552 ACW/CV or
        designated representatives.
        3.1.2. 552 ACW recalls may be one of the following types: General, Selective,
        Telephone Standby, Accountability Only, Senior Battle Staff (SBS), Full Battle Staff
        (FBS) (consisting of SBS Cell, Synergy Cell, Functional Cell, and Advisory Cells) per
        table 3.2 through table 3.4, and Degraded Communications recall. All recalls will have
        procedures in place to conducted using functional communication and under degraded
        communication conditions.
552ACWI10-202 5 MARCH2014                                                                        5


      3.1.3. General Recalls and Selective Recalls (Line 1 and Line 2) will include instructions
      indicating whether personnel should report with their MOBAGs. All units will adhere to
      specified guidance on MOBAG contents as found in TAFB Plan 10-403, Installation
      Deployment Plan, Attachment 3. Mobility items are dog tags (if checked out of mobility
      folder), CAC card, and line badge (if applicable), government issued credit card, and
      government passport (if checked out of mobility folder).
          3.1.3.1. Alpha. BRING MOBILITY BAGS AND ALL REQUIRED ITEMS WHEN
          REPORTING. LEAVE MOBILITY BAGS IN YOUR CAR BUT BRING ALL
          OTHER REQUIRED ITEMS WITH YOU WHEN YOU SIGN INTO YOUR UNIT,

          3.1.3.2. Bravo. MOBILITY BAGS ARE NOT REQUIRED, BUT BRING ALL
          OTHER MOBILITY ITEMS WHEN REPORTING. BRING THE REQUIRED
          ITEMS WITH YOU WHEN YOU SIGN INTO YOUR UNIT, UNLESS THEY ARE
          ALREADY IN YOUR MOBILITY FOLDER.
   3.2. Line One -- General Recall:
      3.2.1. 552 ACW/CP will:
          3.2.1.1. Notify the SBS by verbal contact to initiate the pyramid recall of 552 ACW
          personnel. The SBS is annotated in Table 3.1.
          3.2.1.2. Notify all other BS members with the exception of Squadron Commanders.
          SBS members will notify their respective Squadron Commanders. 552 ACW/Director
          of Staff will notify Wing Deployments (552 ACW/DR) and Director of Personnel
          (552 ACW/DP). In addition to the SBS, the CP will make verbal contact with 552
          ACW/XP, 552 ACW/CP Chief, and 513 ACG/CC. CP will notify additional
          personnel as directed to support the mission.

Figure 3.1. Pyramid Recall Verbiage
      3.2.2. BS members will report to the Battle Cab as soon as possible or as directed.
      3.2.3. Contacted individuals will:
          3.2.3.1. Initiate their portion of the telephone pyramid as directed in their unit recall
          procedures. Contact will be made directly with each individual either by voice or by
          SMS text message. Voice messages, voicemails, or answering machines are not
          sufficient for recall purposes. Messages left with other people are also not sufficient.
          If utilizing SMS texts, the contacted individual must reply back that the recall
          message has been received. Information on the mission tasking will not be relayed for
          OPSEC considerations; only reporting instructions will be discussed. If an individual
          cannot be reached, contact the personnel the absent individual would normally call.
          Do not delay your response to continue attempts to contact unaccounted for
          personnel. Advise your UCC of personnel that could not be reached in the pyramid.
          The UCC or designated representative will continue to attempt to contact the
          personnel who were not contacted during the initial pyramid recall.

           3.2.3.2. Expeditiously report to their normal duty station unless directed otherwise.
           Observe posted speed limits and traffic safety guidelines when responding. Sign in at
           the UCC. Dress is the Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) or Flight Duty Uniform (FDU).
           Mission-essential civilian personnel will wear the appropriate clothing required for
           their duties. During incidents where immediate response of emergency personnel is
           required, the duty uniform requirement may be waived by the unit for those personnel
           not at home when notified of the recall. In these cases, the unit will arrange for
           personnel to change into the duty uniform as soon as the situation allows. Personnel
           will not delay in order to shower or eat, but are to report to their duty sections ASAP
           with their mobility items and their MOBAGs as directed in the recall message
           (Alpha/Bravo).
       3.2.4. UCCs will make every attempt to make contact with all unit personnel not
       contacted during the pyramid recall. If telephone contact cannot be made, the unit
       commander should consider the needs of the mission before sending runners to search for
       unaccounted for personnel.
    3.3. Line 2 -- Selective Recall:
       3.3.1. This option gives commanders the ability to tailor personnel for a particular
       mission while minimizing the disruption of other base functions. This option assumes
       some time to prepare and organize forces prior to execution of the recall. Preparations
       may be initiated with a telephone recall, general recall, or deliberate planning.
       3.3.2. A selective recall may be executed by the CP or the Battle Staff Director (BD).
       For selective recalls, the CP will notify those agencies identified by the Wing
       Commander or designated representative and relay instructions. If executed by the BD,
       the BD will contact the Group Commanders, or designated representative, by secure
       means if necessary, and relay information on the mission being directed and any other
       guidance from the 552 ACW/CC. The CP will be notified that a selective recall has been
       initiated. Upon receiving notification, all units will initiate their pyramid recall
       procedures and BS members will report to the Battle Cab as soon as possible or as
       otherwise directed.
       3.3.3. All commanders will use available time prior to execution of the selective recall to
       prepare for anticipated mission requirements, including setting shift schedules,
       determining mobility needs, assigning aircrew to appropriate alert posture or crew rest.
       3.3.4. Individuals will initiate their portions of the telephone pyramid as directed in their
       unit recall procedures. Contact will be made directly with each individual recalled.
       Messages left with other people or on answering machines are not sufficient for recall
       purposes. Information on the mission tasking will not be relayed; only reporting
       instructions will be discussed. If an individual cannot be reached, contact the personnel
       the absent individual would normally call. Do not delay your response to continue
       attempts to contact unaccounted for personnel. Advise your UCC of personnel that could
       not be reached in the pyramid. The UCC or designated representative will continue to
       attempt to contact the personnel who were not contacted during the initial pyramid recall.
       3.3.5. Notify only personnel necessary for the selective recall. Recalled personnel will
       immediately report to their duty sections. Individuals assigned to mobility status will
552ACWI10-202 5 MARCH2014                                                                     7


     report with their mobility items and MOBAGs, if directed. Personnel assigned to a shift
     later in the day will remain on telephone standby and report for their shift as previously
     directed.
     3.3.6. Individuals in crew rest will remain in crew rest until alerted. Once alerted,
     aircrew assigned to mobility status should report with mobility items and MOBAGs.
  3.4. Line 3 -- Telephone Standby Recall:
     3.4.1. 552 ACW/CP will:
         3.4.1.1. Notify the SBS by verbal contact to initiate the pyramid recall of 552 ACW
         personnel. The SBS is annotated in Table 3.1. CP will notify BS members with the
         exception of Squadron Commanders. SBS members will notify their respective
         Squadron Commanders.
     3.4.1.2. Make verbal contact with 552 ACW/XP, 552 ACW/CP Chief, and 513
     ACG/CC. The CP will notify additional personnel as directed to support the mission.
     3.4.2. Units will: complete their pyramid alert notifications and remain on telephone
     standby. Each unit will report its recall status to the BS via its Group Commander if the
     GCCs and UCCs are not formed. If the GCCs and UCCs are formed, the groups will
     report recall status in accordance with section 4 (Reporting) of this instruction.
     3.4.3. Personnel will: remain available for contact by telephone to receive further
     instructions. Individuals will ensure that their telephone(s) are in working order and that
     they are able to answer without delay. If an individual’s telephone(s) are inoperative or
     the individual needs to be away from his/her telephone(s), the individual will contact
     his/her chain of command and inform them of his/her whereabouts.
     3.4.4. The following verbiage will be used: “THIS IS A LINE THREE TELEPHONE
     STANDBY RECALL. DO NOT REPORT TO YOUR DUTY SECTION. YOU ARE TO
     REMAIN AT HOME, ON STANDBY, UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. DO NOT LEAVE
     YOUR HOME. SQUADRON PERSONNEL SHOULD BE ABLE TO REACH YOU
     WITHIN SIX (6) RINGS.” The CP will notify additional personnel as directed to support
     the mission.
  3.5. Line 4 -- Accountability Only Recall.
     3.5.1. In addition to directed accountability of personnel, this recall can be used to
     practice or test the pyramid notification system. This test is designed to evaluate the
     effectiveness of the recall system, but personnel are not required to report to their duty
     sections. Status reports are not required. Called units will record the time the
     communications test is completed.
     3.5.2. The same procedures will be used to initiate/conduct this recall as a General Recall
     except the following verbiage will be used: “THIS IS A LINE FOUR
     ACCOUNTABILITY ONLY RECALL. INITIATE ACCOUNTABILITY RECALL. DO
     NOT RECALL PERSONNEL IN CREW REST. RECALLED PERSONNEL WILL
     REPORT TO THEIR DUTY SECTIONS AT THE NEXT NORMALLY SCHEDULED
     DUTY TIME AND SIGN IN WITH TIME NOTIFIED OF RECALL.”
 8                                                                  552ACWI10-202 5 MARCH 2014


        3.5.3. Units will complete their pyramid recall procedures and report results to
        appropriate GCCs of the Battle Staff.
        3.5.4. Individuals will initiate their portion of the telephone pyramid as directed in their
        unit recall procedures. Contact will be made directly with each individual. Messages left
        with other people or on answering machines are not sufficient for recall purposes. If an
        individual cannot be reached, contact the personnel the absent individual would normally
        call. Do not delay your response to continue attempts to contact unaccounted for
        personnel. Advise your UCC of personnel that could not be reached in the pyramid. The
        UCC or designated representative will continue to attempt to contact personnel who were
        not contacted during the initial pyramid recall.
        3.5.5. Everyone in the unit, except those in crew rest, will be personally notified of the
        accountability recall. Recalled personnel will report to their duty sections at the next
        normally scheduled duty time and sign in with time notified of the accountability recall.
     3.6. Line 5 -- SBS Recall:
        3.6.1. 552 ACW/CC or designated representative may direct the CP or Wing XP to
        implement a SBS Recall. Members of the SBS Cell are depicted in Table 3.1. The CP
        will add or delete members to/from this list as directed.

   3.7.2. CP will notify the BS members, with the exception of Squadron Commanders, via
   TANS and by verbal contact for those not in TANS. The following verbiage will be used:

Figure 3.3. FBS Recall Verbiage
“THIS IS THE TINKER CP WITH A RECALL OF THE 552 ACW FULL BATTLE STAFF
CELL. THE RECALL INITIATION TIME WAS _____L. THE FBS WILL CONVENE AT
_____L IN THE BATTLE CAB.” The CP will notify additional personnel or delete personnel as
directed to support the mission. The 552 ACG/CC, 552 MXG/CC, and 552 OG/CC will notify
their respective Squadron Commanders in the event of a BS Recall.


      3.7.3. FBS members will normally be recalled to the Battle Cab, Building 280, although
      recall to other locations is possible (i.e. Alternate Battle Cab, Building 989). Members
      will report a minimum of 10 minutes prior to the appointed briefing time to review
      applicable messages and recall additional personnel as needed.
   3.8. Degraded Communication (Degraded Comm) Procedures:
      3.8.1. Degraded Comm recall procedures will be implemented if a recall is necessary and
      normal communications procedures are not available.
      3.8.2. If unable to contact the 552 ACW/CC, the CP will dispatch any available
      personnel (Maintenance Operations Center, Supervisor of Flying (SOF), Support Staff,
 10                                                          552ACWI10-202 5 MARCH 2014


      Command Section, Safety, 72 ABW Security Forces, etc.) to the 552 ACW/CC’s location
      to advise 552 ACW/CC of the situation and to get further instructions.
      3.8.3. In the event the 552 ACW/CC directs a Degraded Comm recall, the MOC will
      appoint and assemble five (5) runners. In the event the MOC is not manned, the 552
      ACW/CC will appoint another agency, such as 552 ACW/CCEA, to assemble the
      runners. Any available personnel (SOF, Support Staff, Command Section, Safety, etc)
      can be used as runners. One (1) individual will be appointed team chief and will ensure
      adequate transportation is available. The team chief will arrange available Wing GOVs
      (e.g. SOF, SE trucks) or acquire vehicles from Base Transportation. 72 ABW Security
      Forces may be of assistance in completing a Degraded Comm recall.
      3.8.4. As directed by the 552 ACW/CC, the CP will provide addresses to and direct the
      runners to the following senior officers’ residences: 552 ACW/CV, 552 OG/CC, 552
      MXG/CC, and 552 ACG/CC.
      3.8.5. On Base: Utilize runners to notify additional on-base personnel. The CP will
      utilize Land Mobile Radio (LMR) network and the Commander’s channel as necessary.
      3.8.6. Off Base: With the approval of 552 ACW/CC in coordination with 72 ABW, the
      CP will notify 72 ABW Public Affairs, who will request local television and radio media
      to announce the recall of 552 ACW personnel.
      3.8.7. When contacted, individuals will initiate their portion of the unit’s Degraded
      Comm Recall, then report to duty. A Degraded Comm Recall requires individuals to walk
      or drive to the next individual’s residence to pass the recall instructions. If an individual
      cannot be reached, contact the personnel the absent individual would normally contact.
      Advise your UCC of personnel that could not be reached.
          3.8.7.1. Unit Degraded Comm recall procedures should be organized by geographic
          locale to the maximum extent possible to minimize the amount of time and distance
          between successive contacts. Units should use maps or detailed instructions to assist
          in locating individual’s homes. URCs will review Degraded Comm recall procedures
          monthly to confirm mission effectiveness.
          3.8.7.2. UCCs will make every attempt to make contact with all unit personnel. If
          contact cannot be made, the unit commander should consider the needs of the mission
          before sending runners to search for unaccounted for personnel.
4. Reporting.
   4.1. The primary means for reporting manning strength is through NIPR UL/UC2 and NIPR
   DCO chat. This information will be reported initially when the UCC is manned and every
   hour (GCCs/UCCs back-up report times accordingly) until 100 percent of the unit and group
   is accounted for. All units will use the following time progression format to report personnel
   status: Recall Initiation Time (RIT) + 1 (1 hour after initiation), RIT + 2, and RIT + 3. It is
   important to note that recalls on UL/UC2 will “time-out” after RIT + 3 meaning no further
   GCC/UCC inputs will be accepted and units will be required to calculate accountability as
   described in 4.2 and 4.3 for remaining unit members.
   4.2. In the event that NIPR UL/UC2 and/or DCO chat is unavailable, an alternate means
   such as telephonic communications or sending a runner to report manning strength will be
552ACWI10-202 5 MARCH2014                                                                   11


  used. The alternate means is for UCCs to report manning strength to their applicable GCC.
  GCCs will report their units’ status to 552 ACW/XP. This information will be reported
  initially when the UCC is manned and every hour (GCCs/UCCs back-up report times
  accordingly) until 100 percent of the unit and group is accounted for. In turn, 552 ACW/XP
  will report directly to the BS (when stood up) or to the 552 ACW/CC.
  4.3. The strength reports for the GCCs and UCCs will include total percentage of personnel
  present or accounted for (PAF). The Unit Status Worksheets (see Attachment 2) are a guide
  to aid data collection and reporting. The Worksheets mirror categories found on UL/UC2. It
  is important to note that the “non-combat quantity” category on UL/UC2 will not be used.
  The accountability categories are defined on the attachment for easy reference. Figure 4.1 is
  an example of how the form should be used.
     4.3.1. PAF is defined as personnel whose whereabouts are positively established by
     personal contact or by reference to official forms such as leave forms, TDY/deployment
     orders or equivalent. Other examples include personnel already at their duty sections, on
     crew rest, performing mission duties such as flying, flight line shift or live ground
     missions. All personnel must be accounted for after the recall is initiated. PAF does not
     include personnel who were seen earlier in the day but not contacted after recall
     initiation.
     4.3.2. Telephone standby recall requires units report percentage of personnel personally
     contacted. Messages left on answering machines, voice mail or with other people do not
     count for accountability purposes. If utilizing SMS texts, the contacted individual must
     reply back that the recall message has been received.
     4.3.3. Wing Staff agencies will report unit manning strength information through 552
     ACW/DP. This information will be reported initially when the UCC is manned and
     every hour (GCCs/UCCs back-up report times accordingly) until 100 percent of the unit
     and group is accounted for.
 12                                                         552ACWI10-202 5 MARCH 2014


Figure 4.1. Example of Unit Status Worksheet




   4.4. BD Update the BS. The BD will update the BS on the current strength status a
   minimum of every hour, starting one (1) hour after recall. In the event the alternate means of
   reporting is accomplished, 552 ACW/DP will compile strength status for the BD prior to the
   required BS update times. For general and selective recalls, accountability objectives are as
   follows:
      4.4.1. 100% SBS notification within one (1) hour or (RIT) + 1.
      4.4.2. Fifty percent (50%) of available personnel present or accounted for within two (2)
      hours or RIT + 2.
      4.4.3. One hundred percent (100%) of available personnel present or accounted for
      within three (3) hours or RIT + 3. Note: After RIT +3, UL/UC2 will no longer tabulate
      accountability. Any outstanding personnel accounted for after RIT + 3 will be counted by
      alternate means.
      4.4.4. All recall messages for TDY/leave personnel generated/sent within four (4) hours.
      4.4.5. All UCCs prepared and able to provide copies of all recall messages to their GCC.
   4.5. GCC/UCC Training. Units will ensure GCC/UCC personnel are trained within 30 days
   of being assigned. UL/UC2 training will be included in the unit GCC/UCC training program.
5. Readiness Posture (RP) Recall Procedures
   5.1. Applicable RPs. The 552 ACW is accountable to NORAD-USNORTHCOM IAW
   NORAD Instruction 10-8 for air homeland defense alerts to include Operation Noble Eagle.
   These alerts are known as RP-15, RP-3 and RP-1 as described in AFI 11-2E-3 V3, 3.22.
552ACWI10-202 5 MARCH2014                                                                     13


     5.1.1. RP-1 denotes an aircraft and crew capable of launching in 1 hour from
     notification. Crews designated for RP-1 alert duty should normally be housed in a
     designated alert facility. 12 hours of pre-alert crew rest is required prior to assuming RP-
     1 alert. CP will be notified by CONR or HHQ to launch. CP will then notify the SBS cell,
     the Noble Eagle DO (NEDO) (552 OSS/DO or designated representative), and 552
     OSS/OSX (Sled Dogs). All notifications should be accomplished within 15 minutes of
     initial notification from CONR or HHQ. All coordination for authority to launch the RP-1
     aircraft and crew will be pre-coordinated between the NEDO and CP.
     5.1.2. RP-3 denotes an aircraft and crew capable of launching in 3 hours from
     notification. 12 hours of pre-alert crew rest is required prior to assuming RP-3 alert. CP
     will be notified by CONR or HHQ to launch. CP will then notify the SBS cell, NEDO,
     and 552 OSS/OSX (Sled Dogs). All notifications should be accomplished within 15
     minutes of initial notification from CONR or HHQ. All coordination for authority to
     launch the RP-3 aircraft and crew will be pre-coordinated between the NEDO and CP.
     5.1.3. RP-15 denotes an aircraft and crew capable of launching 15 hours after
     notification. The RP-15 crew will be present for normal duty each day and carry pagers
     and/or cell phones for notification. Pagers and/or cell phones will have fixed numbers
     corresponding to aircrew positions. Example: Electronic Combat Officer, 555-1234;
     Senior Director, 555-1235. This allows consistency of contact in the event of crew
     member handover and ease of CP contact. CP will contact a daily test of the pager/cell
     phone at 1030L. It is the responsibility of RP-15 crew members to acknowledge the test
     and if not received, will elevate the potential issue to the Aircraft Commander (AC) or
     Mission Crew Commander (MCC). RP-15 crew members will be available to respond to
     alert instructions.
        5.1.3.1. CP will be notified by CONR or HHQ to launch. CP will then notify the SBS
        cell, NEDO, 552 OSS/OSX (Sled Dogs and RP-15 crew members. All notifications
        should be accomplished within 15 minutes of initial notification from CONR or
        HHQ. Crew members will report to the RP-15 AC or MCC within 15 minutes of
        notification to verify receipt and any accompanying orders. Crew rest begins after
        notification and NLT 12 hours prior to crew show time.
