This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 33-2, Information Assurance,
and establishes call sign policy and procedures for the identification of military aircraft,
organizations, activities, bases, units, operational facilities (except global high frequency stations
and navigational aids), staff personnel and geographic locations. This AFMAN applies to the
Air National Guard (ANG) and the Air Force Reserve (AFR) unless indicated otherwise. Voice
Call Signs (VCS) are used to establish and maintain voice communications. Specific personnel
and activities of the Executive Branch, Department of Defense (DoD), Joint Chiefs of Staff
(JCS), United States Army (USA), United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps
(USMC), United States Coast Guard (USCG), unified commands, and other government
agencies are also included at the request of the JCS. Air Force publication AFKAO-1(series),
USAF Voice Call Sign Instructions publication has been canceled, and was replaced by the
Voice Call Sign List Instructions (VCSLI). The VCSLI contains detailed procedures on
acquiring, classifying, releasing and using call signs. Call signs are available to end-users only
in softcopy form. Soft copy products are available on the Voice Call Sign SIPRNet web site.
Products are comprised of between one and four editions for each month. Instructions for
accessing the web site may be acquired by contacting the USAF VCS office. Major commands
(MAJCOM), field operating agencies (FOAs) and direct reporting units (DRUs) should direct
questions or comments on the contents of this instruction through appropriate command channels

                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. Introduction. The Air Force Voice Call Sign Program (VCSP) establishes call sign
procedures to identify military aircraft, organizations, activities, base units, operations facilities
(except global high frequency [HF] stations and navigational aids), staff personnel, and
geographic locations. Voice Call Signs (VCS) are used to establish and maintain voice
communications.
1.2. Applicability. This instruction is applicable to all users of the VCSL1, VCSL2, VCSL3
(formerly AFKAI-1, AFKAI-2 and AFKAI-3).
1.3. General Information. The VCS PMO is located at Lackland AFB, San Antonio, Texas.
The VCS Manager is responsible for managing supported entities’ call signs and works with
Major Commands to ensure regulatory compliance. The following contact information applies:

   MAJCOM VCS POC.
   1.3.2. Other AF activities and supported non-AF activities may submit requests directly to
   the VCSPMO.

     requirement is to ensure the database reflects only existing units and only units with call sign
     requirements. Additional information can be found in the VCSLI.
