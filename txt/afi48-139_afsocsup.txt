                                            Chapter 1

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Overview. Under the General Duty Clause, Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and
Health Act of 1970, this instruction incorporates guidance and criteria for the safe use of lasers
and laser systems as defined in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z136 Series.
   1.1.1. ANZI Z136 classifies lasers according to the type of hazards they present and
   according to the extent of safety controls required. Classes range from the least hazardous,
   Class 1, through the most hazardous, Class 4. For Class 1 and Class 2 lasers, the letter M
   after the number refers to viewing the laser with optical aids so that the laser is magnified.
   Class 3 is divided into subcategories of Class 3R and Class 3B. The older ANSI designation
   for Class 3 was Class 3A and Class 3B. ANSI changed Class 3A to Class 3R with the R
   designating reduced risk. For reference, Table 1.1 below provides a general, but not all
   encompassing, description the classes.

Table 1.1. Class Description.
      Class                                      Description
          1   Not recognized as hazardous
        1M    Could be hazardous if viewed with optical aids (telescopes, binoculars or loupes)
          2   Could be hazardous if viewed for > 0.25 seconds, on-axis
        2M    Increased hazard if viewed with optical aids
        3R    Potential direct and diffuse hazard if eye focused
        3B    Direct eye or skin exposure hazard
          4   Hazardous for direct or scattered exposure

   1.1.2. Military specific lasers employ coherent radiation, are lasers and laser systems used
   for combat, combat training, or classified in the interest of national security, and require AF
   Laser System Safety Review Board (LSSRB) approval prior to acquisition and/or
   employment. Examples include, but are not limited to: laser illuminators, designators, range
   finders, tactical pointers, tactical lasers, and lasers employed to augment explosive ordnance
   disposal. Some, but not all, military specific lasers are considered Directed Energy Weapons
   (DEW) per AFI 91-401. The DoD, or its components, are authorized to exempt these lasers
   from portions or the entirety of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 1010 and/or
   1040 IAW with FDA Exemption No. 76EL-01. Hereafter, FDA Exemption No. 76EL-01will
   be referered to as simply FDA Exemption.
   1.1.3. FDA compliant lasers and laser systems are fully compliant with Title 21, CFR, Parts
   1010 and/or 1040 and do not fall under any category defined as military specific lasers.
   Examples include medical, industrial, laboratory, and communication lasers and laser
   systems. FDA Compliant Lasers may have a FDA accession number issued to the
 6                                              AFI48-139_AFSOCSUP_I 22 OCTOBER 2013


     manufacturer by the FDA or at least have compliance paperwork on file with the FDA for
     verification.
     1.1.4. For other optical radiation hazards, this instruction is based on the current Threshold
     Limit Values (TLVs®) for Physical Agents (Non-ionizing Radiation and Fields - Light and
     Near-Infrared Radiation and Ultraviolet Radiation) published by the American Conference of
     Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH®). Optical radiation hazards and controls for
     welding, cutting, and brazing are delineated in AFOSH Std 91-5, Welding, Cutting, and
     Brazing.
     1.1.5. Optical radiation includes incoherent, multi-wavelength (non-laser) sources of
     radiation in ultraviolet (UV) (180-400 nm), visible (400-700 nm), and infrared (700 nm-1000
     µm) wavelength regions. Examples of potentially hazardous broadband optical radiation
     sources include: intense radiant flashes and thermal energy from pyrotechnics or explosives,
     arcs, gas and vapor discharges, unshielded fluorescent or incandescent light sources, and UV
     exposures which can result in cancer from cumulative exposures. Measurement equipment
     to assess these hazards, generally, is not available at base level; risk assessment and
     associated controls are typically based on manufacturer discussions and consultation with the
     USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) Environmental, Safety, Occupational
     Health (ESOH) Service Center. To contact the ESOH Service Center, call (toll free) 1-888-
     232-ESOH (3764), DSN 798-3764, or send email to esoh.service.center@wpafb.af.mil.
     1.1.6. This instruction prescribes the use of an AF approved Occupational and
     Environmental Health - Management Information System (OEH-MIS) to standardize and
     enhance data entry, management, and reporting.          The Defense Occupational and
     Environmental Health Readiness System-Industrial Hygiene (DOEHRS-IH) is a DoD
     software program designed to provide a web-based information management system that will
     store and manage personal OEH exposure information and monitoring data, personal
     protective equipment (PPE) usage data, and employee health hazard education data.
1.2. Purpose. The purpose of the laser and optical radiation protection program is to protect
health while enhancing combat and operational capabilities. The program is designed to define
and mitigate laser related risks. This program is a key component of the AF ESOH management
system as directed in AFPD 90-8, Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health. Effective
identification and control of laser and other optical radiation hazards is a force extender.
Supervisors and commanders must:
     1.2.1. Implement controls to mitigate risks for identified laser and other optical radiation
     hazards to an acceptable level;
     1.2.2. Ensure risk mitigation will be effected through engineering or administrative controls
     wherever operationally feasible;
     1.2.3. Ensure appropriate Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) or PPE will be made
     available and used when adequate engineering or administrative controls are not
     feasible/practical to:
        1.2.3.1. Enhance workforce and mission capability;
        1.2.3.2. Address laser and other optical radiation impacts from AF operations.

                                           Chapter 3

                               INSTALLATION PROGRAM

3.1. General Guidelines.
   3.1.1. The program elements of this instruction augment those of the ANSI Z136 Series and
   are shared among workplace supervisors and other functional areas such as BE, PH, SEG,
   and healthcare providers. However, the ILSO has overall responsibility to the installation
   commander for the installation laser safety program, and as such shall be designated in
   writing, by the installation commander, as the final authority on all laser operations
   conducted within the installation’s areas of responsibility.
   3.1.2. The fundamental aspects of a laser and optical radiation protection program include
   training, evaluation and control of direct and ancillary laser hazards, medical
   surveillance/examinations, and accident/incident investigation.
   3.1.3. Personnel will not be intentionally exposed to laser radiation in excess of the
   maximum permissible exposure (MPE) levels as defined in ANSI Z136.1, and unnecessary
   exposures to laser radiation below the MPE will be avoided. This does not apply to patients
   receiving medical treatment or to human targets of directed energy weapons.
   3.1.4. If an organization uses Class 3B or Class 4 lasers, the LSO at each level (ILSO, and
   ULSO) shall be appointed by the commander at the appropriate level.
   3.1.5. In addition to the ILSO, specialized ULSOs will be appointed based on the primary
   mission of the unit. ULSOs will consist of aircrew, industrial, medical, range, research, or
   tactical LSOs.
3.2. LSO and User Training Criteria.
   3.2.1. Laser safety training shall be provided initially and annually to users of any Class 1M,
   2M, 3R, 3B or 4 FDA-Compliant Lasers or military specific laser, IAW with the training
   requirements/topics listed in the ANSI Z136 Series, military directives and requirements, and
   training specific to the laser(s) and laser system(s) used by the unit.
   3.2.2. AF LSO training requirements are based upon the primary mission of the unit to
   which the LSO is assigned and require varying levels of knowledge and training for each
   area. In consultation with the ILSO, the ULSO shall determine what, if any, training is
   commensurate with the laser hazards accessible at the unit level. Specific definitions and the
   training requirements for each type of LSO are provided in Attachment 2.
   3.2.3. (Added-AFSOC) Bioenvironmental Engineers have received laser safety training
   and typically serve as the Installation Laser Safety Officer (ILSO). The ILSO is responsible
   for conducting Unit Laser Safety Officer training. Units that are not supported by an ILSO
   can be trained by the Command Bioenvironmental Engineer.
   3.2.4. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC Unit Laser Safety Officer (LSO) training is required upon
   initial duty assignment but there is no annual refresher training required. A course outline is
   provided at Attachment 5, highlighting the different topic areas that should be covered.
 20                                            AFI48-139_AFSOCSUP_I 22 OCTOBER 2013


   3.2.5. (Added-AFSOC) Night vision goggle (NVG) training (conducted IAW AFI 11-
   202V1, Aircrew Training) will incorporate effects of lasers. MAJCOM or Wing Aerospace
   and Operational Physiologists can be consulted as necessary.
3.3. Hazard Evaluations.
   3.3.1. A hazard evaluation shall be conducted and controls established prior to use or
   maintenance of all Class 3B or 4 FDA-Compliant Lasers or military specific lasers. This
   requirement shall include embedded Class 3B and Class 4 lasers if the use or maintenance
   could potentially expose personnel. Additionally, this requirement applies for the equivalent
   lasers and laser systems classified under prior ANSI, International Electrotechnical
   Commission (IEC), or FDA classification schemes.
   3.3.2. The most recent versions of the ANSI Z136 Series shall be adopted to determine
   classification of military specific lasers, calculate/identify beam and non-beam hazards,
   calculate nominal ocular hazard distances (NOHD), nominal skin hazard distance (NSHD),
   nominal hazard zones (NHZ), optical density (OD) and determine controls. The MPE values
   from ANSI Z136.1 shall not be exceeded unless part of an approved human-use protocol or
   medical procedure.
   3.3.3. If an Installation or ULSO suspects and validates that re-classification of a laser may
   result in a lower hazard class, then the classification and labeling should be updated IAW
   ANSI Z136 Series.
   3.3.4. For visible lasers used in an outdoor environment, the hazard evaluation should
   include determining ranges associated with visual interference levels using ANSI Z136.6.
   3.3.5. For broadband optical radiation hazards, TLV®s as listed in the ACGIH® TLV®
   guidebook shall not be exceeded.
   3.3.6. For directed energy weapons (DEWs), AFI 91-401 shall be followed.
   3.3.7. Additional information concerning hazards evaluations may be obtained by contacting
   the ILSO, BE, or the ESOH Hotline. To contact the ESOH Service Center, call (toll free) at
   1-888-232-ESOH         (3764),     DSN       798-3764,       or    send      email      to
   esoh.service.center@wpafb.af.mil.
3.4. Laser Hazard Controls. The purpose of controls is to reduce the risk of exposure to the
skin and eyes even with the presence of PPE, and to prevent exposure to visible laser radiation at
levels that interfere with critical tasks. For purposes of this instruction, exposure is defined as
“unprotected exposure,” i.e. exposure without PPE. PPE is generally considered a secondary
control, to be used in the event primary controls fail or cannot be implemented due to a negative
mission impact. Refer to Attachment 3 for additional information on laser hazard controls and
for ancillary hazards associated with laser systems.
3.5. Medical Examinations for Laser Users and Some Broadband Optical Sources.
   3.5.1. General. Any medical examination requirements are limited to personnel who
   routinely work in a laser environment with Class 3B or Class 4 lasers. Users include
   operators, technicians, engineers, and maintenance/service personnel, etc., working with or
   around these lasers. Specific personnel working in a laser-operating environment, who may
   be exposed to laser emissions, include, but are not limited to, laboratory, aircrew, combat
   control teams, special operations forces and laser range personnel. Personnel who do not
AFI48-139_AFSOCSUP_I 22 OCTOBER 2013                                                           21


   routinely operate in a laser environment may be considered incidental personnel not requiring
   examination.
   3.5.2. Medical Examination Requirements and Frequency for Lasers and Laser Systems.
       3.5.2.1. Laser users and personnel working in a laser-operation environment shall be
       subject to baseline eye exams and post employment eye exams to be determined by a

       3.5.2.1. (AFSOC) Personnel who are functionally using or maintaining ANSI Class 3B
       or Class 4 lasers in the routine course of duties shall receive a baseline exam to include
       ocular history, visual acuity, and Amsler Grid. Additionally, a retinal photograph is
       required. (T-2).
           3.5.2.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Examples of personnel requiring retinal photographs
           include: pilots using command pointers, battlefield airmen, rotary-wing and tilt-wing
           gunners using laser sites, applicable maintenance workers, applicable range
           personnel, and other personnel who routinely use ANSI Class 3B or Class 4 lasers in
           the course of their duties.
       3.5.2.2. Laser users and personnel who work with UV broadband optical sources with a
       history of photosensitivity or working with UV lasers shall be subject to a baseline and
       subsequent skin examinations to be determined by a qualified provider.
       3.5.2.3. Post-employment medical examinations shall be performed as soon as practical
       subsequent to actual termination of duties involving Class 3B and Class 4 lasers (i.e.
       AFSC change, retirement, or separation).
       3.5.2.4. Following any actual or suspected overexposure to laser radiation, the pertinent
       examinations as determined by a qualified provider shall be performed.
   3.5.3. Documentation. Results of all examinations shall be recorded on AF Form 600,
   Chronological Record of Medical Care, or equivalent, and filed in the individual’s medical
   record. Records should be retained for the individual’s working lifetime plus 30 years.
   3.5.4. A qualified provider at the installation level shall determine medical examination
   requirements and frequency for users of optical radiation sources and shall reflect
   requirements in local regulations.
3.6. Accidents/Incidents. Any accidents/incident involving a suspected laser, broadband or
other optical radiation overexposure, visible laser illumination that negatively impacts mission
operations or a laser exposure causing material damage to personnel, AF equipment, systems or
sensors shall be investigated and documented. Additional information on accident/incident
reporting is contained in Attachment 4.
   3.6.1. (Added-AFSOC) When a lasing incident occurs during a flying mission, the aircraft
   commander must make the operational risk management decision to continue or abort the
   mission. This assessment must include human performance limitations from any apparent
   injuries (e.g. vision loss, skin burns), sensor damage, and the possibility that the lasing may
   be repeated.
   3.6.2. (Added-AFSOC) All cases of suspected lasing incidents shall be reported by the
   involved aircrew to the Command Post or deployed Air Operations Center (AOC) as soon as
 22                                            AFI48-139_AFSOCSUP_I 22 OCTOBER 2013


   operationally feasible. (T-2) The Command Post will immediately notify the Chief of
   Safety, Chief of Aerospace Medicine (or on-call Flight Surgeon) and the ILSO. (T-2).
   3.6.3. (Added-AFSOC) The ILSO will conduct an incident investigation. (T-2) A ULSO
   will conduct the investigation for AFSOC units on non-AFSOC bases with the assistance of
   the Special Operations Group (SOG) Bioenvironmental Technician, STG Surgeon or
   Command Bioenvironmental Engineer.
   3.6.4. (Added-AFSOC) Appendix C of the USAFSAM Laser Injury Guidebook contains a
   checklist and form which can be used to conduct the incident investigation and medical
   exam, respectively.
   3.6.5. (Added-AFSOC) All NVGs in use during a potential lasing event should be
   thoroughly operationally tested prior to storing the items. Any NVG showing signs of
   damage should be sequestered.
   3.6.6. (Added-AFSOC) 24.1. The FSO or Group Surgeon will report the event to HQ
   AFSOC/SG, DSN 579-2269. (T-2).
3.7. Special Considerations.
   3.7.1. Medical Lasers. Medical laser assessment may require additional expertise.
   USAFSAM/ OEHH shall provide additional guidance if a health/medical physicist is not
   assigned to the installation. Guidance to assess medical lasers is provided in ANSI Z136.3,
   American National Standard for Safe Use of Lasers in Health Care Facilities and American
   Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Report No. 73, Medical Lasers: Quality
   Control, Safety Standards, and Regulations.
   3.7.2. Range Operations and Other Outdoor Laser or High Intensity Light Use.
      3.7.2.1. Requirements for the use of lasers on AF ranges can be found in AFI 13-212,
      Range Planning and Operations, ANSI Z136.6, American National Standard for Safe
      Use of Lasers Outdoors. Additional guidance can be found in Military Handbook 828A,
      Laser Safety on Ranges and in Other Outdoor Areas.
      3.7.2.2. Range operations involving the use of lasers shall comply with AFI 13-212 and
      AFI 36-2226 as applicable.
      3.7.2.3. Lasers and high intensity lights may adversely impact military aircraft operations
      by temporarily flash-blinding or distracting aircrew during critical phases of flight.
      Guidance to control hazards associated with these operations on a range can be found in
      United States Department of Transportation, FAA Order 7400.2G and ANSI Z136.6.
      The illumination of military aircraft from lasers or high intensity lights is a mandatory
      reportable event, and requires notification to the applicable MAJCOM, COCOM, AFRC,
      ANG Operations Directorate or equivalent and also requires coordination with local and
      federal investigators.
      3.7.2.4. Use of lasers or laser systems, regardless of classification, that have the potential
      to propagate above the horizon requires coordination with US Strategic Command
      (USSTRATCOM) Laser Clearinghouse (LCH) IAW DoDI 3100.11 and SI 534-12.
      Exceptions are hand-held lasers, laser ranging and targeting systems developed for air-to-
      ground or ground-to-ground applications, and laser glint from all targets (space based,
      water based, air based, and ground based). Refer to the current MIL-STD-828B for
AFI48-139_AFSOCSUP_I 22 OCTOBER 2013                                                               23


       specifics on conducting laser testing. For information on coordination or submission of a
       LCH Laser Registration Form for approval or waiver, the LCH can be contacted via
       VOICE: (U) 805-606-1075/1282, DSN 276-1075/1282; FAX: (U) 805-606-1610, DSN
       276-1610.
3.8. Combat Simulation Laser Systems.
   3.8.1. The output power of lasers or laser systems used in force-on-force training shall be
   limited to those systems whose hazard classification is equal to or lower than Class 3R (or
   equivalent), and may require LEP as determined by the ILSO. Examples would include
   lasers and laser systems such as MILES and Havis-Shield.
   3.8.2. Contact the ILSO to determine hazards and controls prior to fielding combat
   simulation laser systems.
   3.8.3. Users of these systems shall be trained initially (prior to first use) and annually on
   hazards and controls.
   3.8.4. As with other military specific lasers, units possessing these systems shall maintain
   accountability and ensure that no combat simulation laser system is released outside of the
   AF unless it is going to another service that has approved the use of the system, has been
   brought into full compliance with 21 CFR 1040.10 & 1040.11 and the compliance paperwork
   filed with the FDA, or destroyed IAW with DODI 4160.21-M.
3.9. Military Specific Lasers.
   3.9.1. Military specific lasers may be exempt from 21 CFR, Part 1040.10, and Part 1040.11
   requirements, and lack certain safety controls if necessary. It is therefore critical that users of
   these systems understand the hazards of the devices they are using and the alternate control
   measures approved by the AF LSSRB.
       3.9.1.1. Military specific lasers shall adhere to approved user OIs, TTPs, SOPs, and
       CONOPs/CONEMPs.
       3.9.1.2. Military specific lasers shall only be used by individuals who are trained in the
       safe use of the device.
       3.9.1.3. Targets shall be positively identified and situational awareness maintained
       during military specific laser operations and training to avoid unintended exposures to
       personnel.
       3.9.1.4. LEP, appropriate for the military specific lasers, shall be worn IAW the AF
       LSSRB approval letter.
3.10. (Added-AFSOC) Education for Aircrews and Special Tactics (ST).
   3.10.1. (Added-AFSOC) Aircrew and ST personnel should have a basic working
   knowledge of laser function and how lasers may adversely impact mission performance.
   3.10.2. (Added-AFSOC) Aircrews and ST should be educated on: (1) threats lasers impose
   on both the human weapon system and mechanical sensors, (2) specific systems employed by
   the unit, (3) specific threats that exist today and countermeasures available to mitigate those
   threats, and (4) how to “reflexively” respond to a laser exposure.

   3.10.3. (Added-AFSOC) Aircrew also require education on the proper notification of
   MAJCOM, investigations, and how to seek medical attention at AFSOC Military Treatment
   Facilities (MTFs) as well as non-AFSOC and civilian treatment facilities. (T-2).
3.11. (Added-AFSOC) Special Tactics.
   3.11.1. (Added-AFSOC) The 720 and 724 Special Tactics Group (STG) Surgeons should
   obtain Unit LSO training.
   3.11.2. (Added-AFSOC) At least one member of each AFSOC Special Tactics Squadron

              AIR FORCE APPROVAL OF LASERS AND LASER SYSTEMS

4.1. Establishment of Laser Safety Review Requirements. Under DoDI 6055.15, each DoD
component shall establish a service specific laser safety review process to provide a system’s
safety review of all lasers used in combat, combat training, or classified in the interest of national
security. This chapter outlines the process by which the AF shall meet this requirement.
   4.1.1. Acquisition/Fielding Requirements for Military Specific Lasers. Any laser or laser
   system which meets the description of a military specific laser, as defined in paragraph 1.1.1.
   of this instruction, regardless of whether the laser is FDA Compliant, shall meet the
   following criteria, prior to acquisition or fielding:
       4.1.1.1. The requesting organization shall obtain a letter of approval from the AF LSSRB
       through AFSEC/SEW. If a laser is considered a DEW per AFI 91-401, then the
       requesting organization shall obtain a letter of approval from the AF DEW Certification
       Board (DEWCB) per AFI 91-401.
       4.1.1.2. The manufacturer shall obtain, through the requesting organization, a DoD
       exemption notification from the AF LSSRB (or from the DEWCB with AF/JAO
       concurrence if the laser is a DEW, per AFI 91-401) through AFSEC/SEW if the laser or
       laser system does not fully comply with the 21 CFR, Part 1040.10 and Part 1040.11. This
       same process shall be followed prior to the selling, distributing, lending, or turning over
       the device to the AF for RDT&E, IAW FDA Exemption.
       4.1.1.3. The laser design shall meet the requirements of MIL-STD-1425A.
       4.1.1.4. The requesting organization shall apply Risk Management (RM) to develop
       CONOPS/CONEMPS, TTPs or equivalent and other written instructions to prevent
       overexposures from lasers to DoD personnel and the public. Written procedures shall
       clearly spell out controls, employment conditions, and procedures in the event of an
       accident/incident.
       4.1.1.5. The requesting organization shall notify the LSSRB if the laser is intended to be
       pointed above the horizon, so that the LCH evaluations can be accomplished.
   4.1.2. Acquisition Requirements for FDA-Compliant Lasers. Any Class 1M, 2M, 3R, 3B, 4
   laser, or laser system (or equivalent) which meets the description of a FDA-Compliant Laser
   as defined in paragraph 1.1.2. of this instruction is subject to the following criteria:
       4.1.2.1. The Installation Commander shall serve as the final approval authority for the
       acquisition of all FDA-Compliant Lasers (or equivalent), unless otherwise delegated
       through installation policy.
       4.1.2.2. The Installation Commander and ILSO should develop policy governing the
       acquisition, review, and use of FDA-compliant lasers on the installation.
       4.1.2.3. The unit should coordinate with the ILSO, prior to acquiring any FDA-compliant
       lasers (or equivalent), to ensure local policy adherence and determine if the device is safe
       for use on the installation.
 26                                             AFI48-139_AFSOCSUP_I 22 OCTOBER 2013


       4.1.2.4. The ILSO should make recommendations for approval/disapproval to the
       Installation Commander regarding all FDA-Compliant Lasers.
4.2. AF LSSRB. The AF LSSRB serves as the AF body appointed the authority to certify
military specific lasers procured by the AF meet all federal, DoD, and AF laser safety regulations
and design requirements prior to acquisition and fielding.
   4.2.1. Chair. AFSEC/SEW shall chair or appoint a chair, and coordinate the review of a
   military specific laser with the AF LSSRB members.
   4.2.2. Voting Members. In addition to Air Force Safety Center Weapons Safety Division
   (AFSEC/SEW), representatives from AFMSA/SG3PB, 711HPW/RHDO,                   Air Force
   Operational Test and Evaluation Center, Safety (AFOTEC/SE), USAFSAM/OE, USAFSAM
   Aeromedical Consultation Service, Aerospace Ophthalmology Branch (USAFSAM/FEC),
   AF/JAO, Air Combat Command, Director of Requirements, Electronic Warfare, Information
   Operations, Directed Energy Division (ACC/A8I), AFRL Directed Energy Directorate, Laser
   Division (AFRL/RDL), and HQ AFMC Safety (AFMC/SES) shall serve as voting members
   to the AF LSSRB. Representatives from 648th Aeronautical Systems Squadron (648
   AESS/CC) and AFRL Hardened Materials Branch (AFRL/RXPJ) shall participate as voting
   members when the military specific laser requires upgrades to existing LEP capabilities or
   otherwise requires integration with existing Life Support Equipment.
   4.2.3. For lasers (other than DEW) intended for joint use, the AF LSSRB shall collaborate
   with the other services' laser safety review boards and authorities under the Joint Service
   Laser Safety Review Process to harmonize test requirements, increase efficiency, and ensure
   that laser safety reviews result in one set of joint service findings. The AF LSSRB shall
   serve as the single AF point of official communication to the FDA for all issues associated
   with laser approvals and the FDA exemption process. The AF DEWCB shall perform the
   same roles for DEW intended for joint use as part of the Joint Service Weapon Safety
   Review Process.
4.3. AF LSSRB Approval and DoD Exemption Process. To obtain a letter of approval and a
DoD exemption notification (if applicable) from the AF LSSRB for any military specific laser
the following criteria shall be met prior to acquisition, fielding, or the manufacturer’s sale of the
device to the AF:
   4.3.1. The requesting organization shall submit on behalf of the manufacturer, through their
   MAJCOM (or equivalent), a request to AFSEC/SEW for a letter of approval and DoD
   exemption notification (if applicable). The most likely requesting organization will be the
   MAJCOM Director of Operations (or equivalent).
   4.3.2. For military specific lasers in development, early interface with the AFSEC/SEW is
   recommended to ensure appropriate safety input into system designs and operations to meet
   federal regulations and DoD requirements. AFSEC/SEW should be involved prior to a
   Milestone C or COTS purchase review of the system to ensure no safety issues prevent Low-
   Rate Initial Production (LRIP).
   4.3.3. The requesting SPO, PEO or PM organization shall coordinate with an AFSEC/SEW
   designated organization to have an independent laser system hazard evaluation conducted
   prior to submission to the AF LSSRB.

   A4.1.1. The Flight Surgeon’s Office (FSO) shall coordinate the event with the ILSO. In the
   absence of an ILSO, the FSO shall coordinate the event directly with AFMSA/SG3PB and,
   as appropriate, with the MAJCOM/SG, USAFSAM/FECO, USAFSAM/OE, and the Tri-
   Service Laser Injury Hotline.
   A4.1.2. The workplace supervisor shall be notified immediately and ensure action is taken to
   prevent injury to other personnel. The laser or optical radiation source shall be taken out of
   service until the accident/incident has been investigated and corrective actions made, as
   necessary.
   A4.1.3. Exposed individuals shall seek medical care immediately at the closest medical
   treatment facility (MTF); a military MTF is preferred. Aircrew or other operational
   personnel who receive a laser exposure from friendly or hostile sources should report to the
   FSO or Squadron Medical Element, if available.
       A4.1.3.1. The medical unit examines the patient and implements procedures for
       reporting and investigating occupational health occurrences. If the exposure was to the
       eye and a military optometrist/ophthalmologist is not available, the member shall be sent
       to a contract ophthalmologist or military optometrist/ophthalmologist at an alternate
       installation for examination.
       A4.1.3.2. If the individual is not being cared for at an AF MTF; the host AF MTF shall
       ensure an AF physician contacts the attending physician immediately to coordinate
       required medical examinations and treatments.
       A4.1.3.3. MTFs shall report any injuries to SEG as required. Safety personnel shall
       ensure additional reporting is accomplished IAW current requirements. A flight surgeon
       and/or aerospace physiologist shall conduct a human factors evaluation of the
       incident/accident.
       A4.1.3.4. The ILSO shall notify the installation SEG, PH, JA, and applicable MAJCOM,
       AFRC, or ANG medical staff.
       A4.1.3.5. In the case of an exposure to a military or civil service member at an ANG
       base, the ANG medical unit shall make every attempt to contact the attending physician
       within 24 hours to determine if medical referral to a military MTF is required.
   A4.1.4. The workplace supervisor shall notify the unit commander, safety officer, ULSO and
   ILSO within 8 hours of the accident/incident.
   A4.1.5. The ILSO shall notify the Tri-Service Laser Injury Hotline (1-800-473-3549) and
   forward a completed DoD laser accident/incident reporting form within 3 duty days
   following a laser accident/incident because immediate indicated care is critical. The DoD
   laser accident/incident reporting form can be found on the ESOH website
   (esoh.service.center@wpafb.af.mil) or by contacting the Tri-Service Laser Injury Hotline.

characteristics, root cause, contributing factors, and corrective measures. The ILSO and/or
Installation SEG shall involve the MTF, as needed. Indications of malicious intent require
involvement of security forces in the investigation. This investigation is separate from, but may
become a part of, a mishap investigation conducted under AFI 91-204; however, in addition to
this instruction, accident/incident investigations shall mirror the guidance regarding mishap
investigations in AFI 91-204. For personnel overexposures, the following information shall be
determined:
   A4.2.1. Name, rank, and Social Security Number (SSN) of individual(s) suspected to have
   been overexposed.
   A4.2.2. Laser, broadband or other optical radiation source nomenclature, characteristics and
   operating parameters at the time of the incident/accident (wavelength, peak and average
   power, pulse width and frequency, beam diameter and divergence, etc.) including those
   parameters that may be classified, if pertinent to the investigation.
   A4.2.3. Date, time, place, unit, duration of the exposure, and the individual’s position
   relative to the laser/optical source.
   A4.2.4. A thorough description of the events leading up to the accident/incident. A signed
   narrative statement shall be obtained from all individuals involved and/or having knowledge
   of the accident/incident.
   A4.2.5. PPE and/or clothing in use at the time of the incident/accident. The wavelength and
   OD for which protection is afforded associated with any LEP in use, shall be annotated.
   A4.2.6. Facility configuration at time of the event.
   A4.2.7. Name, rank, address, and telephone number of the attending physician. If the
   attending physician is not an AF physician, give name, rank, title, address, and telephone
   number of the consulting AF physician.
   A4.2.8. The event should be reconstructed, including measurements and calculations to
   estimate the exposure to the individual. If the equipment and expertise does not exist locally,
   support should be requested through the ESOH Hotline.
   A4.2.9. Assessment of root-cause, confounding or contributing factors, and corrective
   measures to prevent re-occurrence.
   A4.2.10. For exposure of aircrew personnel during flight, the in-flight laser illumination
   incident report in FAA Advisory Circular 70-2, Reporting of Laser Illumination of Aircraft,
   or ANSI Z136.6 Appendix A, is suggested to support exposure investigation.
