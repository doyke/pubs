SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The information and most of the responsibilities included in this instruction transferred from
SAF/XC to SAF/PA due to the Multimedia and Public Affairs merger in 2007. This document
includes significant updates to information in the last version of AFI 33-117, dated 11 Apr 2004,
as well as inclusion of the latest visual information technology. It deletes those activities that
remained in the Communications career field after the movement of the multimedia activities to
Public Affairs, such as information on video teleconference technology.

(USAFA) This revision is significantly updated and must be reviewed in its entirety. It clarifies
conditions of official work, support limitations on USAFA and the chain of authority for the
approval of work requests. Throughout, the term ―Media Services‖ has been replaced with
―Visual Information‖ to coincide with language in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for
contracted services as described in this publication.

                     GENERAL INFORMATION AND CUSTOMERS

1.1. General. Visual Information (VI) is information in the form of visual representations of
persons, places, and/or things. VI professionals create, develop record, assemble, and enhance
visual and audio data into meaningful information. VI includes still photography, motion
photography, audio, video, computer-based products, and graphics. VI excludes alphabetic,
symbolic, or coded data. VI production is the process of structuring data from two or more media
into a cohesive linear or non-linear format or product according to a plan or a script.
1.2. Combat Camera. Combat Camera is a rapid-deployment, aerial-qualified VI activity
trained and equipped to perform visual documentation of wartime, contingencies, crises, and
humanitarian missions.
1.3. Weapons System Video (WSV). WSV support includes copying and editing gun and
bomb damage assessment video for collateral intelligence, training, historical, and approved
public use. WSV includes traditional and non-traditional Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance (NTISR) collection. The ANG is the primary source for WSV support, and
WSV UTCs are postured in the ANG. The ANG is responsible for WSV training and will ensure
all billets assigned WSV missions are coded for a Top Secret clearance requirement. For more
information on WSV and deployment operations, see AFI 35-111, Contingency Operations and
Wartime Readiness.
1.4. Customers. VI is a powerful communication tool in a commander’s arsenal. VI products
can be used throughout the spectrum of operations (in garrison and deployed) from support of
the medical field to anti-terrorism and force protection as outlined in Attachments 2 and 3.
1.5. Roles and Responsibilities. Refer to AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Responsibilities and
Management, for additional roles and responsibilities.
     1.5.1. The ANG is considered a major command for the purposes of this AFI.
1.6. Imagery and Documentation. In this publication, references to imagery refer to any visual
product with documentation.
AFI35-109_USAFASUP_I 2 MARCH 2011                                                                 5


                                            Chapter 2

                    AUTHORIZATION AND USE OF VI RESOURCES

2.1. Defense Visual Information Activity Number (DVIAN) Assignment. AFPAA is the
approving authority for VI activities (see Attachment 4) and assigns DVIANs to requesting
organizations. PA offices at the installation level and at the MAJCOMs will keep a copy of the
current DVIAN authorization document on file.
   2.1.1. Requests for new VI activities, VI changes of mission, or additional Functional
   Account Code (FAC) authorizations require MAJCOM PA approval and will use AFI 38-
   101, Air Force Organization, as a guide. The requesting agency’s commander (or
   equivalent), with support from the organization’s PA office, will certify that the VI activity
   request includes the purpose, deliverables, funding, manning, and sustainment source for the
   new activity.
   2.1.2. For new DVIAN requests at installations where an approved VI activity already exists,
   the requesting agency forwards its request through the installation PA office to the
   MAJCOM PA office for approval or disapproval. If disapproved, the request is returned for
   final disposition or further justification. If approved, the MAJCOM PA office then forwards
   it to AFPAA’s director of operations for final approval.
   2.1.3. DVIANs are revalidated every five years. The installation PA office ensures that a
   revalidation request is completed and sent through the host installation commander and
   MAJCOM PA office to AFPAA. Requests for revalidation should include the following
   information:
       2.1.3.1. Copies of previous and current mission/function statements.
       2.1.3.2. A list of authorized functions performed.
       2.1.3.3. A list of supported units, agencies, activities, or locations. Include copies of the
       host tenant and inter-service support agreements.
       2.1.3.4. Wing commander certification that the function is still needed.
2.2. Official Visual Information Products and Services.
   2.2.1. Air Force VI resources are government property for official mission support.
       2.2.1.1. (Added-USAFA) Direct mission support for USAFA may include support for
       activities supporting higher Air Force or Department of Defense (DoD) initiatives.
   2.2.2. VI materials generated or acquired by Air Force members, employees, or contractors
   in conducting official duties are the property of the United States Air Force. As such, protect
   these materials and preserve as official records, according to public law. Personal use of VI
   materials for sale or any other reason not directly related to an official Air Force activity is
   prohibited. Contact the local staff judge advocate for guidance or clarification. This
   prohibition also applies when Air Force members or employees, by choice or agreement, use
   personally-owned equipment or supplies while performing official duties. Note: Use of
   personally-owned or self-help equipment requires users to adhere to operational security, PA,
   historical archiving, and information security guidelines.

        2.2.2.1. Make contractual exceptions to ownership of products only when it best serves
        the Air Force. The MAJCOM PA office is the approval authority for exception requests.
     2.2.3. The PA office may support historical events when the wing historian, or a designated
     equivalent, certifies the event on an AF Form 833, Multimedia Workorder, as historically
     significant. Accession created products in accordance with Attachments 2 and 3.
     2.2.4. Do not use government-funded VI resources to:
        2.2.4.1. Provide souvenirs, personal gifts, mementos, or farewell gifts.
        2.2.4.2. Support or document farewell parties or social events unless certified as
        newsworthy or having historical significance by the base historian or chief of PA.
        Accession completed products in accordance with attachments 2 and 3.
        2.2.4.3. Create products used primarily for entertainment during farewell parties or social
        events.
        2.2.4.4. Support MWR- or services-sponsored recognition programs.
     2.2.5. (Added-USAFA) If post-production of video or printing of digital images is
     necessary using commercial means, it will be at the requestor’s expense.
        2.2.5.1. (Added-USAFA) Requirements will be met utilizing available manning and as
        scheduling allows, IAW this instruction and contractual terms.
        2.2.5.2. (Added-USAFA) In ALL categories of VI and for ANY requirement support
        may be unavailable based on staffing availability at the time of the request.
2.3. Alteration of Official Photographic Images.
     2.3.1. Air Force PA offices (which includes PA specialists, photographers, videographers,
     and graphics artists) are trusted agents. Because PA professionals can create products that
     can be used in legal proceedings and for critical decision-making, absolute trust and
     confidence in the truthfulness of products they create is essential. Please see DODI 5040.05,
     Alteration of Official DOD Imagery, for correct and incorrect alterations of official imagery.

                GENERAL PHOTOGRAPHIC AND VIDEO GUIDELINES

3.1. Photography and video are essential elements of internal and external communication
programs. Imagery conveys the mission of the Air Force internal and external audiences and
helps achieve the PA core competencies of Airman morale and readiness, public trust and
support, and global influence and deterrence.
3.2. Still photographers and videographers assigned to combat camera or installation-level
PA offices are responsible for documentation of activities IAW DOD 5040.6-M-1, Decision
Logic Table Instructions for Recording and Handling of Visual Information Material.
3.3. Imagery Release. Official images of military and civilian DOD employees generally are
releasable. Images of Air Force activities and people are releasable. However, an image may not
be releasable if it depicts matters that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy, compromise operational security, or negatively impact mission effectiveness.
See AFI 35-104, Media Operations, for more information, and work with the installation PA
office for approval to release the following types of imagery:
   3.3.1. Fatalities or Injuries.
       3.3.1.1. Release of official or stock news images of Air Force casualties is permitted
       after next-of-kin notification.
       3.3.1.2. Release of visual imagery regarding the return of casualties to the United States,
       following DoD guidance and primary next of kin approval. Identifiable U.S. civilians
       who are injured must provide written consent before release of imagery. For more
       information, refer to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of
       1996 and AFI 35-104.
   3.3.2. Children/Minors.
       3.3.2.1. When documenting children, a parent or legal guardian signs a DD Form 2830,
       General Talent Release, or DD Form 2831, General Release Where Talent Fee or Other
       Remuneration or Recompense Accrues to the Participant, allowing use of the minor’s
       image. No exemption exists for documentation of 17-year-old military members, Reserve
       Officer Training Corps (ROTC) or Junior ROTC cadets.
   3.3.3. Courtrooms/Accused Persons. Generally cameras aren’t used in the courtroom even if
   media are in attendance.
   3.3.4. Installations.
       3.3.4.1. Unclassified images of installations are generally releasable. They will meet the
       guidelines on releasing unclassified information, including security and policy review
       requirements.
   3.3.5. Live and inert weapons on aircraft. See AFI 35-104, Media Operations, for updated
   information on weapons imagery that is and is not releasable.
   3.3.6. Prohibited Documentation. Prohibited documentation applies to official and unofficial
   (personal) documentation. Installation PA offices should document activities as required,
8                                                  AFI35-109_USAFASUP_I 2 MARCH 2011


    including classified missions. Just because an event is not releasable does not restrict Air
    Force PA personnel from documenting a scene to fulfill the mission. Clearance and release
    procedures apply after imagery acquisition and not during imagery acquisition.
       3.3.6.1. Sensitive missions.
           3.3.6.1.1. Sensitive missions include, but are not limited to, movement of
           detainees/enemy prisoners of war, special operations activities, detainee operations,
           handling of human casualties, and repatriations of remains.
           3.3.6.1.2. Prior to any mission or activity, PA will ensure official public release IAW
           DODI 5040.04, Joint Combat Camera (COMCAM) Program, and AFI 35-101. This
           restriction applies to any mission, whether executed at home station or while
           deployed in support of contingency operations. Air Force members overseas must
           comply with status of forces agreements, the laws of the host nation, and other
           instructions of the combatant commander responsible for that area.
       3.3.6.2. Potential privacy violation. Reference DOD 5400.11-R for definitions of privacy
       issues.
       3.3.6.3. Detainees or Human Casualties in some situations.
           3.3.6.3.1. Operational, internal-use-only documentation by Air Force photographers
           or videographers operating in their official capacity is exempt from this policy.
           Mission needs require Air Force public affairs personnel (which includes
           photographers and videographers) to act as trusted agents and cover the full spectrum
           of visual documentation. Existing Department of Defense (DOD) and Air Force
           policy governs their actions.
           3.3.6.3.2. Documentation is permitted in the execution of official duties. All other
           documentation is prohibited.
           3.3.6.3.3. These guidelines apply to all Air Force military, civilian, or contract
           personnel serving with, employed by, or accompanying the Air Force, except for
           personnel assigned to defense attaché offices, security detachments, and sensitive
           intelligence and counterintelligence activities that are conducted under the direction
           and control of the Chief of Mission/Chief of Station or other U.S. Government
           agencies and departments identified on a case-by-case basis. In these cases, personnel
           will abide by the policies of the appropriate organization or command.
           3.3.6.3.4. The possession or unaltered distribution of open media (e.g., magazines
           and newspapers) visual images is not prohibited but subject to copyright laws and for
           official duties.
       3.3.6.4. Suffering or mutilated persons.
       3.3.6.5. Restricted areas, control points, or security measures.
       3.3.6.6. Medical Personnel Bearing Arms.
           3.3.6.6.1. Medical personnel may only carry arms for self-defense. Photographing or
           taking video of medical personnel with weapons may create the false impression that
           these personnel are violating the law of war and needlessly risk their safety.
AFI35-109_USAFASUP_I 2 MARCH 2011                                                                 9


       3.3.6.7. Merchandise Endorsements. Do not release photographs of Air Force people
       with products or merchandise with trade names appearing in such a way they imply Air
       Force endorsement.
       3.3.6.8. Signs and Posters. Photograph signs and posters only if they are in good taste.
       3.3.6.9. Suggestive or Obscene Photographs.
       3.3.6.10. Classified Information.
           3.3.6.10.1. Do not photograph classified materials for public release. When taking
           photographs in operational areas, be conscious of classified weapons, maps, or charts
           that may be in the background.
           3.3.6.10.2. When handling classified materials for official use, do so in accordance
           with AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, Chapter 5.
3.4. Appearance of Military Members in Imagery. Personal appearance will conform to AFI
36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel. Pay careful attention to Air
Force safety standards for people and equipment, such as required wear of safety goggles or
hearing protection. Wing commanders and chiefs of PA may waive the AFI 36-2903 guidelines
when recent mission and operational duties result in imagery that shows Air Force people with
worn uniforms.
3.5. Posting unauthorized photos, videos, or descriptions of missions, resources, or facilities
on the Internet in any forum can aid an adversary. Therefore, possession, distribution, transfer, or
posting, whether electronically or physically, of visual images resulting from any unauthorized
photography or videos is prohibited.

                            INSTALLATION-LEVEL SUPPORT

4.1. The installation PA office provides professional VI products and services. This includes
photography, graphics, video, and other products.
4.1.1. Employment Plan. The chief of PA will ensure an annual employment plan is developed
to properly prioritize all office activities, including VI tasks and workflow focusing on
operational core tasks, urgency, mission impact, agencies supported, task complexity, and
resources available. The plan should be reviewed on an annual basis and approved by the
installation commander.
   4.1.2. The installation PA office is not funded, equipped, or manned to replace services
   provided by the Document Automation Production Service (DAPS). According to DODI
   5330.3, Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS), the Air Force must obtain
   automated printing services from DAPS. Reproduction is limited to 30 tabloid size (11‖ x
   17‖) or smaller copies of products and no more than five copies of products larger than
   tabloid size.
4.2. The installation PA office’s photography function provides:
   4.2.1. Professional photographers to support base-level photographic requirements for
   managerial, operational, training, educational, historical archiving, investigative, and

                                           Chapter 6

                 MANAGING VISUAL INFORMATION PRODUCTIONS

6.1. Purpose of the Visual Information Production Program. VI productions are video
products which support the full range of Air Force training, education, corporate
communications, and information requirements. They differ from video documentation in that VI
productions are self-contained and complete, accomplished according to a plan or script,
produced under controlled circumstances, and for an intended customer and audience. The DOD
and Air Force manage VI products and productions for both historical and retrieval purposes.
The process is designed to provide access to the information for all who require it. The process
also ensures the removal of non-current products from inventory.
   6.1.1. VI productions and products are permanent official records which are created and life-
   cycle managed as described in this instruction and in DODI 5040.2, Visual Information,
   DODI 5040.6, Life-Cycle Management of DOD Visual Information (VI), DODI 5040.07,
   Visual Information Production Procedures, and DODI 5040.09, Department of Defense
   Productions.
   6.1.2. Each Air Force production contains a master production file IAW paragraph 6.6.3.
   6.1.3. VI productions can be distributed on any format (videotape, CD-ROM, DVD, or
   Internet) or optically projected or displayed.
6.2. Visual Information Production Types. There are two types of VI productions: local
productions and Air Force productions.
   6.2.1. Local VI productions are for local (installation use) objectives and usually have a
   limited life span. Treat and manage local VI productions exceeding the specifications
   described in this paragraph as an Air Force VI production. The PA office may provide up to
   70 total copies of the production. If there is a need for more than 70 copies, the request will
   approved by AFPAA. The installation PA office should maintain a distribution list of all
   productions reproduced and distributed for the life of the product.
       6.2.1.1. The OPR and the requester of the local production should perform a periodic
       currency review. Recommended guidelines can be found in DODI 5040.07.
       6.2.1.2. The producing PA office assigns a Production Approval Number (PAN), which
       consists of the letter F, the production center’s DVIAN, the last two digits of the fiscal
       year, and a sequentially assigned four-digit number. A hyphen separates each element
       except F. An example is F3023-10-0053.
           6.2.1.2.1. The PAN is annotated on the DD Form 1995 and appears electronically at
           the beginning of local productions.
       6.2.1.3. The producing PA office maintains a PAN log with the PAN, production title,
       media format, and customer’s name, organization and telephone number for all local
       productions produced at the installation.
   6.2.2. Air Force VI productions are created for multi-base, command-wide, Air Force-wide,
   and DOD-wide requirements. For Air Force VI productions, the installation PA office
   provides guidance to the requestor to complete the DD Form 1995 and then sends the DD
 24                                                AFI35-109_USAFASUP_I 2 MARCH 2011


   Form 1995 to the appropriate MAJCOM PA office. The MAJCOM PA office validates the
   request, ensures the information is accurate and complete, and forwards the DD Form 1995
   to AFPAA for certification and Production Identification Number (PIN) assignment.
       6.2.2.1. DOD organizations requesting Air Force VI production support coordinate their
       DD Form 1995 with AFPAA.
       6.2.2.2. Productions should be reviewed periodically for currency. Recommended
       guidelines can be found in DODI 5040.07. Air Force members who find a noncurrent
       production that meets their organization’s requirements may request to become the OPR
       for the production.
6.3. Accessibility. VI productions will be made accessible to individuals with disabilities in
accordance with DODI 5040.09 and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended.
   6.3.1. The requesting organization determines the likelihood of hearing and/or visually
   impaired personnel accessing the VI production and must be prepared to fund for both
   captioning and audio descriptive copies of the product.
   6.3.2. VI production centers can seek captioning support on behalf of the customer. The
   DOD Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program Office (CEAPO) provides caption
   support on a case-by-case basis. Requests for caption support are submitted to DOD
   Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program Office, Defense Medical Information
   Management, 511 Leesburg Pike, Suite 810, Falls Church VA 22041-3206. The DIMOC also
   provides these services at cost to the customer. Contact DIMOC only in cases where free
   services are not available from CEAPO.
6.4. Exemptions. Some products are not considered VI productions and do not require lifecycle
management. In addition to exempted products listed in DODI 5040.07 and DODI 5040.09, the
following Air Force items normally are normally exempt:
   6.4.1. ―Quick look‖ VI reports such as after-action reports, RDT&E technical reports,
   reconnaissance reports, and intelligence reports.
   6.4.2. Television announcements, radio spot announcements, public service announcements
   (PSAs), news clips, and information programs funded by the Defense Media Activity (DMA)
   or its Air Force element.
   6.4.3. Information programs funded and reported as recruiting advertising.
   6.4.4. VI products resulting from criminal investigation and other legal fact-finding efforts.
   6.4.5. Commercial VI productions or programs purchased, leased, or rented; include those
   intended for DOD dependent schools; MWR activities or education centers; and/or libraries
   under DODI 1015.15, Establishment, Management, and Control of Nonappropriated Fund
   Instrumentalities and Financial Management of Supporting Resources.
   6.4.6. VI products about techniques, procedures, and management of DOD cryptological
   operations.
   6.4.7. Photomechanical reproductions, cartography, and microfilm and microfiche
   productions.
AFI35-109_USAFASUP_I 2 MARCH 2011                                                                25


   6.4.8. Command and control information displayed with weapons systems and in command
   and control centers and posts.
   6.4.9. VI products collected solely for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.
   6.4.10. VI products and productions created for a specific course of instruction in an
   educational activity, unless the production is intended for distribution beyond the installation.
   6.4.11. Weapon system video.
   6.4.12. Exempted VI products that are used as part of or to create another VI production
   should be life-cycle managed using this instruction as a guideline.
6.5. VI Production Restrictions.
   6.5.1. In addition to items listed in DODI 5040-09, Air Force VI productions should not
   contain material that:
      6.5.1.1. Shows DOD personnel in an unfavorable or undignified situation unless doing
      so is essential to the production’s message.
      6.5.1.2. Is inaccurate or incompatible with Air Force policy or doctrine.
   6.5.2. Customers must not cut, re-edit, or otherwise alter or reproduce copies of VI products
   without permission of the OPR. Requests for segments of VI productions for briefings or
   other productions must be coordinated through AFPAA and the OPR. This procedure
   precludes inadvertent violation of copyright or legal restrictions.
   6.5.3. Proprietary Production. PA offices producing VI productions should coordinate and
   obtain content review and approval from the functional OPR. This may include, but is not
   limited to:
      6.5.3.1. Security.
      6.5.3.2. Safety.
      6.5.3.3. Equal opportunity.
      6.5.3.4. Human relations.
      6.5.3.5. Chaplain, law enforcement, legal, and medical activities.

     6.6.1.4. Coordinate with the DIMOC for replication and distribution. DIMOC replicates
     and distributes Air Force productions, according to a memorandum of agreement.
     Requesters may be required to fund replication and distribution costs for products.
  6.6.2. In addition to the procedures outlined of DODI 5040.07, the OPR and the VI
  production activities will:
     6.6.2.1. Initiate security and policy review and legal review for all productions unless
     release to the public is denied by the customer.
     6.6.2.2. Track and record direct costs.
         6.6.2.2.1. Costs incurred as a direct result of the production; e.g., labor for scripting,

     6.6.4.2. Provide any additional support needed to complete production.
AFI35-109_USAFASUP_I 2 MARCH 2011                                                              27


      6.6.4.3. Review and coordinate the script with Air Force organizations or other military
      and government agencies. Verifying the content of the script does not conflict with
      policies and objectives of the supported command or the Air Force.
   6.6.5. Approve scripts before production begins.
      6.6.5.1. Ensure personnel, facilities, and support are available from the organization and
      outside resources.
      6.6.5.2. Ensure an initial, validated distribution list with the DD Form 1995 that includes
      current addresses.
   6.6.6. Additionally, the SMEs will:
      6.6.6.1. Ensure accuracy of technical information in the script and production, but not
      the technical quality, media selection, treatment, or other items that fall under the
      producer’s or production activity’s responsibilities.
      6.6.6.2. Ensure procedures, concepts, and ideas reflect current Air Force and MAJCOM
      policies, plans, and objectives.
      6.6.6.3. Give the production activity the technical data, directives, training aids and
      devices, and other equipment needed for the production.
      6.6.6.4. Attend planning conferences, on-location surveys, recording sessions, approval
      screenings, and post-production events.
      6.6.6.5. Review story boards and help select technically correct footage.
      6.6.6.6. Determine the security classification, downgrading, and reviewing instructions
      for material. Inform the producer or project officer of the classification of all production
      elements such as story boards, research documents, scripts, still photos, slides, graphics,
      and props.
6.7. Contract VI Productions.
   6.7.1. It is recommended that MAJCOM PA offices and installation PA offices periodically
   contact the appropriate installation contracting official, usually contracting squadron
   commanders, to ensure they know that the Air Force has in-house video production
   capability available to satisfy most official video production requirements. The MAJCOM or
   installation PA office should request the contracting squadron include a referral to the
   installation PA office in its instructions to customers regarding preparation of acquisition
   packages.
   6.7.2. AFPAA can provide guidance on video production contracts and put customers in
   contact with a specialized VI activity to procure productions from commercial sources to
   support Air Force and DOD requirements.
   6.7.3. The MAJCOM PA office reviews and approves VI production portions before the
   awarding of the contract to make sure the contractor follows this instruction and AFI 33-322,
   Records Management Program, that costs are reasonable, and that the contract does not
   duplicate existing capabilities. Existing capabilities include:
      6.7.3.1. Research and development, weapon systems, and similar contracts when the
      production is a provision of the contract for status reporting and new equipment training.
 28                                                 AFI35-109_USAFASUP_I 2 MARCH 2011


       6.7.3.2. Curriculum development contracts (such as interactive courseware and
       instructional systems development) when the project needs a qualified curriculum
       development contractor (rather than an audiovisual producer) unless the production costs
       more than 50 percent of the total.
   6.7.4. VI production contracts funded by the Air Force should state that the materials and
   final VI products and productions are the property of the Air Force and the Air Force
   maintains authority over materials. Contracts will include unrestricted rights for the
   government to copy and distribute any portion or all of the production.
   6.7.5. For contracts with another service or government agency, the contracting officer, via
   the installation PA office, should request AFPAA approval before providing support.
   6.7.6. The installation contracting officer should write contracts with specific language that
   requires compliance with all the requirements in public law and DOD and AF policy.
6.8. Copyright License. Using copyrighted media requires a separate license or explicit
permission. Generally, both music and programs recorded from broadcasts are copyrighted.
Having the source recording or music score does not confer any right to reproduce, transfer, or
otherwise use or perform the recorded material, either as a whole or in part. The installation PA
office should discuss with the installation JA office when use of copyright material is in question
and receive specific clearance for each use from the copyright owner. A clearance may:
   6.8.1. Give the government the perpetual right to duplicate, distribute, publish, exhibit, use,

                           VISUAL DOCUMENTATION PROGRAM

7.1. Purpose of the Visual Documentation (VDOC) Program. The VDOC program ensures
that Air Force wartime, contingency/humanitarian operations, historical, and newsworthy events
are visually recorded. Joint Force Commanders, Commander of Air Force Forces
(COMAFFOR), and Air Expeditionary Unit Commanders use VDOC imagery as a decision-
making tool for critical operational assessment and their PA communication needs. Other
mission-related uses can be training, battle damage assessment, post strike assessments, public
information, intelligence, and providing an accurate record of Air Force operations. The use of
PA personnel and tasking procedures in contingency operations are outlined in AFI 35-111,
Contingency Operations and Wartime Readiness.
7.2. Shipping or Transmitting Visual Documentation Images.
   7.2.1. Still Imagery.
       7.2.1.1. Deployed PA personnel will expeditiously process, review for release, and
       transmit still imagery with captions to AFPAA’s Air Force Media Center, which will
       forward all imagery to DIMOC. If electronic transmission isn’t possible, send reviewed
       still images to AFPAA by the fastest means possible, after the theater’s review for release
       is completed.
       7.2.1.2. The DIMOC serves as the central DOD reception and distribution point for
       current imagery. The DIMOC makes imagery available to the Secretary of Defense
       (SECDEF), Chairman of the Joint Chiefs (CJCS), the military services, the Unified
       Combatant Commands, the defense agencies, and other DOD components.
   7.2.2. Motion Imagery.
       7.2.2.1. Deployed PA personnel will expeditiously process, review for release, and
       transmit motion imagery with captions to AFPAA’s Air Force Media Center. If electronic
       transmission isn’t possible, send reviewed motion imagery to AFPAA by the fastest
       means possible.
   7.2.3. Installation-Level Imagery.
       7.2.3.1. Some installation imagery may include home station resources departing to or
       arriving from deployments or high-visibility transient missions. After being reviewed and
       cleared for release by the installation PA office, significant imagery with proper caption
       information should be sent to AFPAA’s AF Media Center.

                                           Chapter 10

       AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHIC/VIDEO DOCUMENTATION OPERATIONS

10.1. Purpose. DODI 5040.04, Joint Combat Camera (COMCAM) Program, specifies the
requirement for Air Force aircrew-qualified personnel to support operational missions. This
chapter establishes guidance to ensure the identification of combat aircrew requirements and
availability of qualified aircrew photographers and videographers to support Air Force and DOD
operations worldwide. This chapter is written specifically for aerial photographic and video
management and applies to all 3N0X2 and 3N0X4 personnel performing aircrew and operational
support duties. The AFPAA manages this activity for all 3N0X2 and 3N0X4 personnel in the Air
Force. These duties are to perform photographic or video documentation in flight as part of an
authorized aircrew complement, according to AFI 65-503,US Air Force Cost and Planning
Factors, and AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges,
or as non-aircrew operational support.
   10.1.1. The expense of initially and continually qualifying aerial photographers and
   videographers mandates cost-effective program management. AFPAA will ensure the
   training and qualification of only the number of 3N personnel needed to support operational
   mission requirements.
   10.1.2. Two programs provide differing qualification levels: aircrew and operational
   support.
       10.1.2.1. Aircrew (9D). The purpose of aircrew-qualified positions is to provide aerial
       photographers and videographers qualified at the same level as aircrew members. Two
       factors drive the authorization: frequency and nature of duties. Individuals should be
       trained and qualified when they perform aerial duties at least once a month and those
       duties expose them to extreme danger; i.e. high altitude events, ejection seat aircraft, and
       open door operations. Examples of aircrew programs include Combat Camera-type duties
       or test and evaluation aerial positions.
       10.1.2.2. Operational Support (9C). This program provides leadership with minimal
       aerial photographic or video mission capability for infrequent, non-combat, or non-
       hazardous missions when an aircrew-qualified individual is unavailable due to cost or
       time factors. This program uses man-month authorizations provided by HQ USAF to the
       MAJCOMs and distributed to Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) offices.
       10.1.2.3. Reference AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and AFI 11-202 V1, Aircrew
       Training, for generic training requirements and the HARM office for location-specific
       training.
   10.1.3. Only Air Force military or civilians with a photographer or videographer AFSC or
   occupational series and identified by their HARM office as meeting program qualification
   requirements can participate in the aerial imagery program.
10.2. AFPAA Roles and Responsibilities. AFPAA will:
   10.2.1. Ensure the availability of qualified personnel to support worldwide aerial
   photographic or video operations.
AFI35-109_USAFASUP_I 2 MARCH 2011                                                              39


       10.2.1.1. Coordinate with AF/A3O to establish program policies, aerial photographic and
       video positions, and revalidate existing aircrew positions annually.
   10.2.2. Designate the executive agent for the Air Force Aerial Photographic and Video
   Program for all aerial documentation issues.
       10.2.2.1. Develop aerial photographic and video Job Qualification Standards (JQS) and
       Qualification Training Packages (QTP) to ensure standardized training.
       10.2.2.2. Draft and periodically review aerial photographic and video program AFI 11-
       series training and evaluation policy.
   10.2.3. Identify and coordinate requirements for aircrew authorizations or operational
   support within the AF.
   10.2.4. Annually justify and coordinate aircrew position requirements IAW AFI 11-402,
   8.3.3.
   10.2.5. Ensure the program is only applied to valid mission requirements through
   management review and inspection procedures.
   10.2.6. Fund all needed training and equipment through the program objective management
   process.
   10.2.7. Coordinate training quotas (i.e., life support and survival school).
   10.2.8. For aircrew positions (9D), appoint by letter aircrew flight examiners and instructors
   to manage the overall aircrew standardization/evaluation program.
   10.2.9. Ensure all designated personnel can perform aircrew duties, according to the
   appropriate AFI 11- series.
   10.2.10. Refer to AFI 11-401 for authorization to perform in-flight duties in non-US Air
   Force aircraft.
10.3. Subordinate Unit Roles and Responsibilities. Subordinate units will:
   10.3.1. Ensure flight hours are logged only when they support valid mission and training
   requirements. Logging flight hours for the sole purpose of receiving flight pay is
   unauthorized.
   10.3.2. Appoint training managers, flight examiners, and instructors to manage the unit
   aircrew training programs, according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
   10.3.3. Ensure the qualification of aerial photographers/videographers in accordance with
   guidance provided by the Air Force aerial photographic and video program and the local
   HARM office.
   10.3.4. Ensure only tested and approved photographic/video equipment as approved IAW
   AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules, is used for aerial documentation. Contact
   AFPAA for the most recent list of approved equipment.
   10.3.5. Coordinate host base support for all aircrew or operational support requirements.
   10.3.6. Develop and maintain aerial documentation operating instructions in coordination
   with local units and/or HARM offices.
 40                                               AFI35-109_USAFASUP_I 2 MARCH 2011


   10.3.7. Generate an AF Form 833 for each instance an aerial photographer or videographer
   performs aerial duties. Each quarter subordinate units will provide electronic copies AF Form
   833s to the MAJCOM PA office.
   10.3.8. Control costs by ensuring qualification of only the minimum number of people
   necessary to meet mission needs.
   10.3.9. Ensure a qualified aircrew member provides an aircraft orientation/emergency
   procedures/egress/BOLD FACE on an airframe that is not the aerial photographer or
   videographer’s primary airframe.
10.4. Organizational Requests for Aerial Photographic Support. For all units who request
Combat Camera support outside of a Request for Forces or Unit Type Code, organizations will:
   10.4.1. Request COMCAM aerial documentation support through AFPAA via the
   MAJCOM PA office.
   10.4.2. Request non-COMCAM aerial documentation support through the installation PA
   office if aerial qualified personnel are available.
       10.4.2.1. If local aerial qualified personnel are not available or cannot support the
       request, the installation PA office will send the request to AFPAA via the MAJCOM PA
       office.
       10.4.2.2. AFPAA coordinates and requests aerial support from the nearest unit
       possessing qualified personnel within their organization. The requesting agency is
       responsible for funding travel costs associated with the request.
10.5. Public Affairs Aerial Photography.
   10.5.1. Media Relations. Because the purpose of media orientation flights and media travel
   is to cover the Air Force mission, media reporters, videographers, and photographers will be
   authorized to perform aerial photography. Coverage of the mission is on a non-interference
   with mission basis. News media representatives (NMRs) will observe all safety regulations
   and follow the directions of the flight crews at all times. Use of electronic recording
   equipment on aircraft is at the discretion of the aircraft commander IAW AFI 11-202,
   Volume 3. All such equipment will be turned off if directed by the aircraft commander.
   Wireless or digital media equipment may require an electromagnetic analysis and approval
   prior to use on aircraft in flight. Submit requests for analysis and approval IAW AFI 11-202,
   Volume 3.
   10.5.2. Community Relations. Part of what makes an Air Force tour a memorable experience
   are the photographic memories captured by the tour participants. Air Force tour participants
   will be allowed to take personal pictures/video within the bounds of safety and security. They
   will observe all safety regulations and follow the directions of the flight crews at all times.
   Use of electronic recording equipment will be granted at the discretion of the aircraft
   commander. Such equipment will be turned off if so directed by the aircraft commander.

                 ADVANCED STILL AND MOTION MEDIA PROGRAM

11.1. Purpose.
   11.1.1. The Advanced Still and Motion Media Program provides the Air Force with a
   capability to communicate with visual, written, and broadcast products in a comprehensive
   manner. Enlisted Airmen trained by DOD or Air Force organizations understand how to
   create products. Graduates of this program not only understand how to create products, they
   understand why. They are educated, not trained, in the art of communication. Their ability to
   create products that communicate at levels far more thoroughly than their peers makes them
   invaluable in communicating to internal and external audiences. Graduates of the program
   receive the Special Experience Identifier (SEI) 332 for photojournalists and 333 for motion
   media journalists.
11.2. Responsibilities.
   11.2.1. AFPAA will:
       11.2.1.1. Manage the program and ensure the most effective use of SEI 332 and 333
       Airmen.
       11.2.1.2. Develop and publish program selection criteria and notify the field when
       criteria is updated or changed.
       11.2.1.3. Appoint qualified field representatives to review and rank order submission
       packages. Provide the selection list with alternates to AFPC/DPAA no later than 15 Jan.
       11.2.1.4. Develop the SEI 332/333 assignment priority roster using inputs from the field
       and provide the roster to AFPC/DPAA. Review the list annually and provide updates to
       AFPC.
   11.2.2. AFPC/DPAA applies personnel policy to the selection list provided by AFPAA to
   determine the most eligible Airmen and provides AFPAA with rationale on non-selection of
   individuals and waiver guidance if possible or necessary.
   11.2.3. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will:
       11.2.3.1. Provide AFPAA with comprehensive justification for each SEI 332/333
       position within their command annually. The justification states why a base-level
       photographer or broadcaster cannot meet requirements, the individual’s primary duties,
       position number, grade, organization, office symbol, and contact information.
       11.2.3.2. Ensure SEI 332/333 individuals’ primary duties do not mirror base-level
       photographers or broadcasters but are instead used for developing critical communication
       products, mentoring, or training.
   11.2.4. Advanced Still and Motion Media Students will:
       11.2.4.1. Present professional images at all times whether in uniform or not, complying
       with the standards as referenced in AFI 36-2903. Airmen in student status will comply
       with Air Force customs, courtesies, and directives. Wearing of the uniform is optional
       unless directed otherwise by the ROTC detachment commander. Compliance with all
 42                                                AFI35-109_USAFASUP_I 2 MARCH 2011


       directions or orders provided by the ROTC detachment is mandatory. Failure to do so
       will lead to disciplinary action.
       11.2.4.2. Obtain a letter of ―student status‖ for the academic year from the ROTC
       detachment before departing and provide it to their next servicing military personnel
       flight (MPF) for entry into their official records. Failure to do so will lead to delays in
       follow-on enlisted performance report (EPR) processing and could affect promotion
       testing.
       11.2.4.3. Maintain at least a ―C‖ grade average in all courses. The highest-ranking
       student is responsible in ensuring individuals having academic difficulties receive help
       meeting the ―C‖ grade standard. Students are responsible in notifying the ranking student
       when they have difficulties.
11.3. Selection Process.

   A5.4.1. If help is needed with obtaining approved file transfer protocol (FTP) software and
   properly configuring it for use, transmitter should contact the unit’s workgroup administrator.
   A5.4.2. Use the following addresses and passwords:
       A5.4.2.1. FTP server address: URL vicenter.bolling.af.mil. If the URL does not work
       then use the following IP Address: 162.24.10.05. Note: The AFPAA’s Air Force Media
       Center is the AF accessioning point.
       A5.4.2.2. Login: Anonymous
       A5.4.2.3. Password: e-mail address
       A5.4.2.4. Folder creation and use: Place all files into a folder using the following naming
       convention: yymmddbase (example 100107bolling).
       A5.4.2.5. Routine imagery should also be sent through this process or through normal
       distribution channels.
A5.5. Digital imaging standards. The following imagery standards guidelines are established.
These standards are consistent with Defense Visual Information and Combat Camera
requirements for satisfying image quality standards.
   A5.5.1. Digital camera images. Do not alter the file size in any way. Don’t crop the image. If
   necessary, rotate the image accordingly.
   A5.5.2. Film images (scanned).
       A5.5.2.1. Scanner controls. Ensure that all color or brightness/contrast options are set at
       zero or in their default neutral position.
       A5.5.2.2. Sharpening. Ensure ―sharpen‖ control is off.
       A5.5.2.3. Resolution. Optimum resolution is 2000 pixels per inch (PPI), which will
       result in a 15 MB file when cropped to the edges of the image area. Minimum resolution
       is 1350 PPI, which results in approximately 8 MB file when cropped to the edges of the
       image area. Use best judgment. If the connection is to a LAN with high bandwidth and
       moderate saturation, then send the higher resolution file. If your connection is to a 28.8
       modem or less, then balance the file size with transmission time.
          A5.5.2.3.1. Color correction. Do not adjust color on scanned or digital photographs.
          Until such time as all color monitors, scanners, and printers can be profiled (all
          systems certified) to the International Color Consortium color standards, it would be
          inappropriate to perform color adjustments of any imagery sent to the Air Force
          Image Records Accessioning Center.
          A5.5.2.3.2. File compression. JPEG compression will not exceed 15:1.
              A5.5.2.3.2.1. For Photoshop, select a value no less than 9 on the sliding scale.
A5.6. The FTP server, worldwide web browsers, and many other software require a three-letter
extension at the end of a file YYMMDD-X-0000X-000.JPG (VIRIN.JPG), but do not include the
.JPG extension in the VIRIN field in the IPTC header data.
