                                             Chapter 1

                              GENERAL PURPOSE AND SCOPE

1.1. Purpose: Provide guidance and a standardized approach to procure and sustain these
equipment items. Additionally, it outlines overall management responsibilities for aircraft sun
shades, crew shelters and portable/inflatable shelters.
1.2. Scope: Applies to all AF units possessing or procuring these equipment items to support
logistics operations. It applies to any aircraft sun shade installed in the flight line or maintenance
areas. This includes conventional force logistics units; nuclear and nuclear support units; cyber
and space; special operations; wholesale-level procurement, sustainment, and maintenance;
aerial port squadrons; logistics readiness squadrons; research, test, and development units. It
does not include medical logistics, civil engineering logistics, security forces units and
communications units.
   1.2.1. Aircraft sun shades and other shelter types as defined below and addressed in this
   instruction are considered equipment items for accountability purposes and will be tracked/
   accounted for on appropriate documents (i.e. R-14/R-15 or locally built accountability lists)
   and managed IAW AFMAN 23-122, Material Management Procedures, AFH 23-
   123V2PT2, Materiel Management Systems and AFI 23-111, Management of Government
   Property in Possession of the Air Force. (T-1). Items will also be assigned locally generated
   identification numbers and tracked in the Maintenance Information System (MIS). (T-1).
   These assets are not listed on unit authorized equipment tables of allowance because they are
   not required support equipment for weapons systems. These assets are the responsibility of
   the owning organization. Commanders will ensure all other applicable organizations with
   appropriate subject matter expertise are involved in the procurement, installation, repair,
   sustainment, and replacement of these assets.
1.3. Definitions.
   1.3.1. Aircraft Sun Shades: Structure with the sole purpose of providing minimal protection
   for personnel from the elements (sun, wind, rain, snow, etc., excluding lighting) with a roof
   and a maximum of two sides. Aircraft sun shades are not considered as temporary or
   relocatable facilities associated with MILCON projects.        Procedures for temporary or
   relocatable facilities associated with MILCON projects are contained in AFI 32-
   1021, Planning and Programming Military Construction (MILCON) Projects. Aircraft
   sun shades are not intended to replace aircraft maintenance hangars and as such there is no
   requirement associated with aircraft specifications or real property procedures contained in
   AFI 32-1024, Standard Facilities Requirements, or AFMAN 32-1084, Facility
   Requirements. This term is now the standard term to identify these structures.
       1.3.1.1. Aircraft sun shades are not considered temporary facilities nor real property. In
       addition, though it is possible to relocate aircraft sun shades, they are not considered
       relocatable facilities per the definition in AFI 32-1021. Relocatable buildings are
       designed to be readily erected, disassembled, stored, moved, and reused to meet a short-
       term requirement for facilities due to either transitory peak requirements or urgent
       requirements pending approval, such as construction of facilities via normal military
       construction programs. According to AFI 32-1021, Chapter 6, Relocatable and
4                                                                      AFI21-136 20 JULY 2012


       Temporary Facilities, the terms temporary and relocatable are interchangeable.
       Furthermore, AFI 32-1021 provides guidance on satisfying interim facility requirements
       using relocatable or temporary facilities. Aircraft sun shades are not incident or interim
       to a MILCON project, nor are they in place to meet a temporary requirement;
       therefore the terms temporary or relocatable as used in AFI 32-1021 does not apply to
       aircraft sun shades.
    1.3.2. Crew Shelters: Any portable or prefabricated structure placed inside/under or erected
    to support activities within an aircraft sun shade, hangar, hardened aircraft shelter or
    protective aircraft shelter. These should not be confused with other shelters that are designed
    for personnel protection only (e.g. End-of-Runway shacks).
    1.3.3. Portable/Inflatable shelters:     A structure constructed using layers of membrane
    connected together using pressurized air to produce a structure which covers limited areas
    (e.g. cargo aircraft engine, open fuel tanks) of an aircraft or equipment.
    1.3.4. Allied support: Utilities (e.g. electrical, water, air, communications, etc.) provided up
    to a stub at each aircraft sun shade. Utilities are real property assets. Installation of new
    utility services carries a work classification of Construction. See paragraph 2.9.
