           2.1.1.1. The 507 FSS/SCOK will be responsible for maintaining a SharePoint
           documents folder that will contain copies/links for all official, current, and mandatory
           items.    This folder will be accessible via the 507 ARW SharePoint Site
           (https://org.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/1139/default.aspx) under 507 ARW Bulletin
           Boards.
       2.1.2. The 507 FSS/SCOK will conduct inspections of bulletin boards on a random basis
       using the Bulletin Board Compliance Checklist found in Attachment 2.

       and Forms Manager is responsible for assigning control numbers for permanent and
       temporary VA’s.
    2.2. Bulletin Board Monitors.
       2.2.1. Bulletin boards will have clearly marked sections: “Official”, “Safety” and
       “Union”. More than one bulletin board may be necessary. Unofficial boards are not a

       Labor- Management Agreement.

           2.2.3.1. Organizational specific items will not be inspected by the Wing OPR.
       2.2.4. Post all unofficial material according to the policy of the organization and ensure
       employee “For Sale” notices do not reference duty phone or office. This will prevent
       unauthorized use of government time and resources. Restricted unofficial material (such
       as political announcements, advertising of a commercial nature, and for sale items where
