1. MSFRIC Requirements.
     1.1. MSFRIC shall receive AU publications and documents regularly and automatically so
     its collection of documents is comprehensive enough to meet the reference and research
     needs of AU and the Air Force.
     1.2. MSFRIC shall receive copies of all publications and documents that give information on
     AU programs, state or support policy decisions, or have research or reference value on the
     AU mission and its operations. Examples include: Business Case Analyses, self-studies for
     accreditation, and Professional Studies Papers. Faculty publications are excluded.
     1.3. AU activities that create these publications and documents send only one copy to
     MSFRIC and establish procedures to ensure that MSFRIC receives all the items described in
     paragraph 3. The procedures will address the media format appropriate to the specific
     publication or document. MSFRIC prefers that items are sent electronically.
     1.4. The staff, faculty, and students of AU participating in educational, doctrinal, and
     research programs are the primary readers of classified documents sent to MSFRIC.
     MSFRIC handles and stores classified information up to and including TOP SECRET,
     Restricted Data.
2. Responsibilities: AU activities that send documents and publications to MSFRIC are
responsible for maintaining copies of documents in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications
and Forms Management, and other pertinent directives.
3. AU Schools and Centers: AU schools and centers will add MSFRIC to their distribution
lists for:
     3.1. Students’ papers (Air War College, Air Command and Staff College, School of
     Advanced Air and Space Studies) which meet school releasability standards
     3.2. Self-Studies for accreditation (SACS, PAJE)
     3.3. Research reports and Business Case Analyses
4. Forwarding Information: The MSFRIC Director corresponds directly with all Air Force
activities to carry out this instruction. Materials sent to the attention of (or for action by) the
Commander, AU, or to a specific AU agency do not satisfy the MSFRIC need for documents and
publications. Send all publications and documents to AUL/LTSA, Bldg 1405, 600 Chennault
Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6010. Send classified publications and documents to AUL/ES,
Attn: Security Officer. Information for the Air Force Historical Program (see AFI 84-101,
Historical Products, Services and Requirements) is separate from MSFRIC requirements. Send
that information to AFHRA/ISA, Bldg 1405, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-
6010.
