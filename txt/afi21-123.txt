Management. Minor administrative changes, office symbols, addresses and publication
references have been updated throughout the document.
1. Program Objectives. The Air Force Repair Enhancement Program (AFREP) optimizes Air
Force resources and repair capability of aerospace parts and equipment by increasing the wing-
level participation with the appropriate Program Office (PO). This is accomplished by field level
identification and recommendation of candidates for reparability consideration by the appropriate
PO. The concept is to make recommendations to the program manager of
consumable/expendable items which the field has identified as desirable candidates to be
considered for conversion to field-level repair, limited repair or even full depot level repair,
contract or organic as directed by the DSOR process in AFI 63-101. The approval to change the
SMR/ERRC codes, or select, use, arrange for, contract with , qualify sources of repair, or
authorize the initiation of any local or other repair action rests solely with the program manager.
     1.1. Repair Approval: In accordance with AFI 63-101/20-101, Life Cycle Systems
     Engineering, personnel must coordinate any operational change to the system or end item or
     modified configuration or maintenance procedure (i.e., additional base-level repair or
     contract repair of any item beyond the provisions which already exist in field Technical
     Orders (TOs)) prior to implementation. NOTE: Field personnel including AFREP work
     centers shall not contract or arrange for repair services without prior written authorization by
     the appropriate program manager for the item recommended for repair. The appropriate PO
     responsible for the system or end item shall retain responsibility for making any decision
     stemming from such a recommendation. Field TOs do not give permission for local contract
     or off-base repair of any item, only on-base repair to the extent specified by the SMR code
     for a given item.
     1.2. Operational Safety, Suitability & Effectiveness (OSS&E). Operational Safety,
     Suitability & Effectiveness (OSS&E) is an outcome of properly planned and applied systems
     engineering. Organizations responsible for preserving OSS&E of Air Force systems or end
     items must ensure that operational use, configuration changes, maintenance repairs, aging,
     part substitutions, and similar activities and events do not degrade baselined characteristics of
     systems or end items over their operational life. It is an integrated effort to ensure items are
     not allowed to degrade as a result of maintenance, repairs, parts substitutions, and similar
     activities. The program manager is responsible for the assurance of OSS&E throughout the
     life cycle of each configuration of each component of each system. Only the program
     manager may convert an item from non-reparable to reparable.
2. FREP Requirements.
     2.1. Requirements. Given authorized repair of a consumable/expendable item, the program
     manager will determine the SMR/ERRC code validity. All resulting changes are linked with
     Supply Chain Manager consideration for that item. Supply Chain Management issues must
     be considered as a matter of law, given these issues affect Congressionally Authorized
     budget authority and funds allocated to accomplish specifically different supply chain
     functions (spares buys versus repairs).
AFI21-123 27 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                   3


       2.1.1. Any personnel, organization or AFREP work center may request SMR/ERRC
       code changes in accordance with TO 00-25-195, AF Technical Order System Source,
       Maintenance, and Recoverability Coding of Air Force Weapons, Systems, and
       Equipments, Chapter 4 and AFH 23-123, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 8.
   2.2. Asset Turn-In. Items repaired in accordance with Technical Data will be turned in to
   the supply system following guidance in AFMAN 23-122, Chapter 6 and Technical Order
   (TO) 00-20-3, Maintenance Processing of Repairable Property and The Repair Cycle Asset
   Control System.

Terms
Awaiting Parts—The condition or status of an item (equipment) needing additional part(s) to
repair it or make it serviceable for use. Also sometimes used to describe the elapsed time a
repairable item spends awaiting parts while in the repair cycle.
Critical Application Item—An item that is essential to weapon system performance or
operation, or the preservation of life or safety of operating personnel, as determined by the
military services. The subset of CAI whose failure could have catastrophic or critical safety
consequences is called CSIs.
Consumable Items—Also known as “Consumption” or “Expendable” Items designated XB3.
Items which are consumed in use or which lose their original identity during periods of use by
incorporation into or attachments upon another assembly. Issued on an as required basis and
consist of such supplies as maintenance parts or office supplies.
Critical Safety Item—A part, assembly, installation equipment, launch equipment, recovery
equipment, or support equipment for an aircraft or aviation weapons system that contains a
characteristic any failure, malfunction, or absence of which could cause a catastrophic or critical
failure resulting in the loss or serious damage to the aircraft or weapons system, an unacceptable
risk of personal injury or loss of life, or an uncommanded engine shutdown that jeopardizes
safety. Damage is considered serious or substantial when it would be sufficient to cause a "Class
A" accident or a mishap of severity category I. The determining factor in CSIs is the
consequence of failure, not the probability that the failure or consequence would occur. For the
purpose of this instruction "Critical Safety Item", "Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Part", "Flight
Safety Part", "Safety of Flight Item", and similar terms are synonymous.
Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability, Category (ERRC)—Used to categorize Air
Force inventory into various management groupings. The grouping determine the type of
management used throughout the logistics cycle, designates the process to be used in computing
requirements and are used in the correction and reporting of asset and usage data. (e.g., XB3,
XF3, XD2, NF2, NF4).
Program Manager—the DoDD 5000.01 designated individual with responsibility for and
authority to accomplish program objectives for development, production, and sustainment to
meet the user’s operational needs. PM for sub-systems shall support overall system objectives as
required by the SPM. The PM for acquisition programs shall be accountable for credible cost,
schedule, performance, and materiel readiness to the MDA. The PM for sustainment programs
shall be accountable for credible cost, schedule, performance, and materiel readiness to the
AFMC/CC, AFSPC/CC, or designee. ACAT I and ACAT II PM shall be chartered by the SAE
and the PEO. Delegated ACAT II and III PM shall be chartered by the PEO.
AFI21-123 27 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                       9


Repairable—Unserviceable items that can be economically repaired and restored to a
serviceable condition.
Repair Recommendation—An idea or proposal to repair an item that is not currently repaired
or is beyond the capability of the work center. An AFREP initiative is generated when an asset
has a demand level of "greater than three" per calendar year. All new AFREP initiatives will be
staffed through the applicable organizations.
Recoverability Code—A one position code assigned to end items and support items to indicate
the recoverability intention and the level of maintenance authorized disposition action on
unserviceable support items; and for reparables, it is used to indicate the lowest maintenance
level responsible for repair/condemnation and disposition of the item.
Source Code—Codes assigned to end items and support items to indicate the manner of
acquiring items for the maintenance, repair, or overhaul of end items.
Non—Consumable Item—Also referred to as a “Non-expendable or Equipment” item. Durable
items that are capable of continuing or repetitive use by an individual or organization.
Operational Safety, Suitability & Effectiveness (OSS&E)—Operational Safety, Suitability &
Effectiveness is an outcome of properly applied systems engineering principles, processes, and
practices. Well-integrated configuration management and control, deficiency reporting and
response, reliability, maintainability, integrity, and other engineering practices ensure that base-
lined engineering characteristics of systems and end items are not allowed to degrade as a result
of maintenance, repairs, parts substitutions, and similar activities. The program manager is
responsible for the assurance OSS&E throughout the life cycle of each configuration of each
component of each system.
Source, Maintenance, Recoverability (SMR) Code—A code assigned to parts/assemblies that
provides maintenance activities with repair level responsibilities, support method and disposition
instructions. The SMR codes are also input into the supply and maintenance automated data
system. The uniform SMR code is composed of three parts, consisting of a two position source
code, a two position maintenance code, and one position recoverability code.
Program Manager—The DODD 5000.01 designated individual with responsibility for and
authority to accomplish program objectives for development, production, and sustainment to
meet the user’s operational needs. PM for sub-systems shall support overall system objectives as
required by the SPM. The PM for acquisition programs shall be accountable for credible cost,
schedule, performance, and materiel readiness to the MDA. ACAT I, ACAT IA, and ACAT II
PM shall be appointed by the SAE and the PEO. Delegated ACAT II and III PM shall be
appointed by the PEO or DAO.
Standard Base Supply System (SBSS)—A unified management system that accomplishes all
Logistics Readiness Squadron/supply activity and service workloads. The Standard Base Supply
System operates through the collective interactions of supply procedures, service procedures,
processing routines, and the SBSS computers.
Supply Reports—There are many examples of “Supply Reports” used to record supply
transactions. The Daily Document Register (D04) provides a means for organizations to review
all document numbers processed during the day by the SBSS. The PFMR and Organization Cost
Center Record Update and Reconciliation (D11) show the current status and internal balance of

the PFMR by supplies and equipment. The Repair Cycle Asset Management Listing (D23) is
used to monitor repair cycle assets and as a management product to monitor the stock position
and repair cycle status of repairable (DIFM) assets. It may be produced in several sequences and
is provided to the customer daily.
Technical data—Information (regardless of the form or method of the recording) of a scientific
or technical nature, including computer software documentation. As applied in this publication, it
includes information required for the design, development, production, manufacture, assembly,
operation, training, testing, repair, maintenance, or modification of defense articles.

           CRITICAL APPLICATION ITEMS & CRITICAL SAFETY ITEMS

A2.1. CRITICAL APPLICATION ITEMS (CAIs). For the purpose of this instruction, it is
an item that is essential to weapon system performance or operation, or the operating personnel
as determined by AFI 20-106IP, Management of Aviation Critical Safety Items.
   A2.1.1. Includes flight/safety critical, life support, critical safety items (CSI), and nuclear
   hardened items. For systems including radar, avionics, munitions, etc, contact the PO for the
   system to obtain the CAI designation.
   A2.1.2. The management of CAIs (contains unique repair and manufacturing qualifications;
   material/manufacturing process requirements; and extensive testing requirements after repair)
   is a complex process. These specified procedures rest with the program manager.
   A2.1.3. Other than TO and PO approved repairs, Electronic Warfare (EW) Systems are
   Critical Application Items and prohibited from consideration under the AFREP program.
   Performing repairs on EW system components may render the entire EW system degraded.
   Environmental Stress Screening (ESS) of repaired EW components is mandatory. Many EW
   components cannot be repaired due to electrical characteristics that are not visible or evident
   without special test facilities and procedures, none of which are available to field personnel
   or unqualified contractors.
A2.2. CRITICAL SAFETY ITEMS (CSIs). For the purpose of this instruction, CSIs are
items whose failure may cause loss of life, permanent physical disability or major injury, loss of
a system, or significant damage to equipment.
   A2.2.1. Special attention is placed on CSIs due to potential catastrophic or critical
   consequences of failure; Public Law 108-136, sec 802 was enacted to address aviation CSIs.
   The public law addresses three concerns:
       A2.2.1.1. The Design Control Activity (DCA) is responsible for processes related to
