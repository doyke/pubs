  YOUR RIGHTS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION &
          SEXUAL HARASSMENT
                                       56 FW POLICY: Equal Opportunity and treatment for our military
                                       and civilian personnel is the responsibility of each member of the
                                       56th Fighter Wing. We will not tolerate any acts of discrimination or
                                       sexual harassment in the wing. I expect commanders and supervisors at
                                       every level will take swift and firm action to prevent and eliminate
                                       discrimination, of any kind.




IT IS IMPORTANT THAT EACH MEMBER: Conduct all
affairs free of discrimination based on race, color, religion,
national origin, sex, and in the case of civilian employees, age,
disability, sexual orientation or genetic information. Take
immediate action to eliminate inappropriate behavior,
comments and jokes. Know avenues to address discrimination
and try to resolve issues at the lowest possible level. The use of
Alternative Dispute Resolution is highly encouraged.

The Equal Opportunity Office (EO) is available to assist in filing
formal or informal complaints of discrimination or to simply
provide guidance about potentially harassing or discriminatory
behavior. Military EO complaints should be filed within 60 days
of occurrence. Civilian EO complaints should be filed within
45 days of awareness.




           “Equal Opportunity is really quite simple; fairness, dignity and justice in the treatment of
           all Airmen. Every Thunderbolt needs to take an active role in eliminating discrimination
           at Luke Air Force Base. If you see discrimination happening I need you to act
           immediately. The use of racial, sexual or any other type of slurs, comments or jokes
           intended to degrade or insult another is completely unacceptable and does not align with
           our core values. I cannot do this alone…I need your help.”
