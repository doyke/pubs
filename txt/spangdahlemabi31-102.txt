Additionally CP will, Contact Public Affairs to update the Spangdahlem Community Facebook
page. Removal of the Binsfeld and Speicher Government Leased Housing (GLH) from
Attachment 2. Attachments 4, 5 and 6 have been updated.
1. Responsibility. The on-duty 52d Security Forces (52 SFS) flight chief will ensure
compliance with this instruction.
2. Road Conditions and Color Code Definition: During the winter season, the Eifel region
often experiences severe weather; however, we must maintain optimum mission capability. This
requires frequent assessment of road conditions in the area. Each road condition (ROADCON)
is outlined as follows:
     2.1. ROADCON GREEN: Normal driving for all vehicles. Operations will continue as
     normal and all base services are open. Personnel will report as normal, and the Medical
     Clinic and Department of Defense Dependent School (DoDDS) will operate as usual.
     2.2. ROADCON AMBER: Roads are moderately hazardous and drivers must exercise
     caution. Operations and services are open with minimal impact. Personnel should report
     to work, but allow additional travel time to arrive at work safely. Delays in reporting
     must be coordinated with supervisors. The 52 FW/CC may authorize civilian employees up
     to two (2) hours of administrative leave due to weather delays IAW AFI 36-815, paragraph
     7.6.
        2.2.1. Early release may occur during AMBER. The Medical Clinic will be open as
        normal; however, in the event of an early release, the clinic will close within two (2)
        hours of the order. If DoDDS is given an early release, afterschool activities will be
        cancelled. All DoDDS Youth Sports and Instructional classes will be cancelled in the
        event DoDDS is given an early release.
     2.3. ROADCON RED: Roads are very hazardous. Drivers must exercise extreme caution
     and limit driving to essential trips to and from the base. Unit commanders will determine
     which personnel should report to ensure mission accomplishment. Personnel should
     attempt to report to duty when safe to do so. Delays in reporting must be coordinated with
     supervisors. Customers should verify availability of services prior to reporting for
     appointments. Personnel on duty should remain on their shift and should consider remaining
     on base after their shift concludes, consulting supervision before departing the base to
     evaluate fatigue and worsening weather and road conditions.
        2.3.1. Early release may also occur during RED. The Medical Clinic will be open as
        normal; however, in the event of an early release, the clinic will close within two (2)
        hours of the order. If DoDDS is given an early release, afterschool activities will be
        cancelled. All DoDDS Youth Sports and Instructional classes will be cancelled in the
        event DoDDS is given an early release.
        2.3.2. The 52 FW/CC may authorize civilian employees up to two (2) hours of
        administrative leave due to weather delays IAW AFI 36-815, paragraph 7.6.
        Additionally, tardiness in excess of 2 hours may also be excused because of an
        unavoidable delay resulting from adverse weather or from disruption of public or private
        transportation in individual cases which are personally reviewed by appropriate
        supervisors. The supervisor must determine, after personal review of the facts in each
SPANGDAHLEMABI31-102 9 JANUARY 2012                                                               3


      case, that the employee made every reasonable effort to get to work, but was unable to do
      so because of the weather conditions.
      2.3.3. The Medical Clinic will have limited services and personnel are requested to call
      452-8333 to check status of availability until the ROADCON changes. DoDDS may
      experience a two (2) hour delay or an early release. Child Development Center, School
      Age Programs, and Youth Programs may experience a one (1) hour delay in opening. In
      the event of an early release the Child Development Center, School Age Programs, and
      Youth Programs will close within 2 hours of the order. Youth Sports and instructional
      programs will be cancelled or released immediately. Parents who are deemed Mission
      Essential will be referred to the Family Child Care Extended Duty Program for care prior
      to facility openings and/or after facility closures. After-school activities will be cancelled
      in the event of an early release. If conditions warrant, school may be cancelled
      completely.
   2.4. ROADCON BLACK: Roads are extremely dangerous. Privately-owned vehicles
   should not be on the roads. Air Force installations are closed during this road condition.
   Only First Responders and personnel involved with Snow and Ice Control will report
   for duty. Required personnel should allow additional travel time to arrive safely. Delays
   must be coordinated with supervision. Personnel on duty should remain on their shift and
   should be prepared to remain on base after their shift concludes. The Medical Clinic will be
   closed. DoDDS will be cancelled.
3. Information Gathering Procedures for Delay or Cancellations.
   3.1. The on-duty flight chief or designated representative will ensure:
      3.1.1. Law enforcement patrols check the base’s major traffic routes both on and off base
      IAW Attachment 2 (i.e. B50, L46, L39, B51, L36, B257, and A60) for severe road and
      weather conditions (i.e., excessive fog, snow, or ice). Patrols will report their
      observations, IAW Attachment 2, to the Base Defense Operation Center (BDOC) no
      later than 0400.
      3.1.2. When hazardous conditions are observed, BDOC will coordinate with the 52d
      Operations Support Squadron /Weather Flight (52 OSS/OSW) or the 21st Operational
      Weather Squadron (21 OWS) at Sembach to determine whether conditions are expected
      to continue, grow worse, or lessen.
      3.1.3. BDOC contacts local civilian police and ascertains road conditions for the greater
      Spangdahlem and Bitburg area. BDOC will also gather information on major vehicle
      accidents in the 6 hours prior to 0400 to assist in determining road conditions.
      3.1.4. Monitor road conditions throughout the day and recommend upgrading or
      downgrading road condition codes to the Chief of Security Forces (CSF) as appropriate.
4. Hazardous Roads Posing a Safety Concern.
   4.1. If weather conditions change the driving environment to hazardous and increase the
   likelihood of accidents, the on-duty flight chief notifies CSF to discuss road conditions.
   4.2. When conditions are determined to be Amber, the BDOC will notify the Command Post
   (CP) of the conditions. BDOC will detail the conditions from the matrix in Attachment 2,
4                                            SPANGDAHLEMABI31-102 9 JANUARY 2012


    which exist on the roadways in the local areas such as flooding, patches of ice, light slush,
    snow varying 1-3 inches, visibility reduced to 40 meters.
    4.3. When conditions appear to pose a danger to vehicle travel, the on-duty flight chief will
    contact the CP with proposed road conditions and any recommended delays or cancellations,
    as applicable, no later than (ADDED) 0400 to ensure the DoDDS busing office receives and
    delay or cancellation updates by 0430. The CP will initiate a 5-way conference call between
    the CP, BDOC, 52 MSG/CC, 52d Civil Engineer Squadron (52 CES) Snow Control (to
    provide current status of clearing equipment), 726 AMS Air Mobility Control Center
    (AMCC), and 52 OSS/OSW or 21 OWS. The flight chief will detail existing roadway
    conditions from the matrix in Attachment 2. The 52 OSS/OSW or 21 OWS will provide
    current and forecasted weather conditions. The 52 MSG/CC will notify 52 FW/CC of road
    conditions and recommendations. 52 MSG/CC will notify the CP of the 52 FW/CC’s
    approved road conditions, any delays, or cancellations.
