This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 40-2, Radioactive Materials
(Non-Nuclear Weapons) IAW Title 42 of the United States Code (42 U.S.C.), Chapter 23,
Development and Control of Atomic Energy; Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10
CFR) Chapter I Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and the conditions of the US Air Force Master
Materials License (MML) issued by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and
managed by the US Air Force Radioisotope Committee (RIC). It applies to all US Air Force
personnel including members of the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard (ANG). It
further applies to all Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Energy (DOE), contractor
and other activities using, storing, or transporting radioactive material (RAM) on any US Air
Force (USAF) owned or leased property. It instructs personnel on procedure for the acquisition,
receipt, security, use, storage, transfer, transport, distribution, and disposal of all RAM in the
USAF. It prescribes how non-USAF activities get approval to use, store, or transfer RAM on
USAF installations. RAM covered by this instruction includes, without limitation, NRC licensed
and exempted nuclear materials, sealed sources, and devices involving source material, special
nuclear material (SNM), and byproduct material as defined by the NRC and 10 CFR Chapter I.
Since the 1 October 2007 publishing of the Requirements for Expanded Definition of Byproduct
Material, Final Rule, in the Federal Register, NRC regulation of naturally occurring and
accelerator-produced material (NARM) as byproduct material includes “commercial, medical,
and research [but not military-unique] activities” involving “discrete source[s] of radium-226”;
“material made radioactive by use of a particle accelerator”; and certain other “discrete source[s]
of naturally occurring radioactive material, other than source material”. This AFI does not
generally apply to nuclear reactor programs, nuclear weapons systems or waste, or other

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: This revision has been tiered (T-0, T-1, T-2, and T-3) IAW AFI 90-201, The Air Force
Inspections System, 2 August 2013, with waiver authority stated in the introductory paragraph
IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, 25 September 2013. The delegation of
SECAF authority to manage radioactive materials in compliance with applicable federal laws
and regulations was clarified. The regulation of tenant organizations possessing or transporting
radioactive materials on USAF installations was clarified. The make-up and roles of the
Radioisotope Committee were updated and clarified. The reference for the physical protection of
Category 1 and 2 radioactive material sources (10 CFR Part 37 Physical Protection of Category
1 and Category 2 Quantities of Radioactive Material) was added and emphasized. The role of
the LAF (including the AF/A4/7 community) in ensuring federal compliance in radioactive
materials management, transportation, and disposition was emphasized. The requirements
concerning installation radiation safety reviews, audits, and briefs were modified. The use of the
Radioactive Material Management Information System (RAMMIS) was mandated for inventory
of all AF regulated radioactive material (RAM) AF-wide. Several lesser updates and changes
were made. Telephonic inspections by AFIA have been discontinued. This AFI now accounts
for situations including Joint Basing and Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) where
Permittees and Permit Radiation Safety Officers (PRSOs) do not have access to a local

                                    PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Overview.
     1.1.1. This instruction provides uniform policy, instruction, and guidance for the
     management and control of radioactive material (RAM) in the USAF world-wide. It sets
     forth how USAF personnel or units manage (to include acquire, receive, use, store, transfer,
     transport, distribute, and dispose of) all RAM not expressly excluded from the purview of
     this AFI. This instruction also prescribes how non-USAF entities get approval to use, store,
     and transport RAM on USAF installations.
     1.1.2. Applicability. RAM covered by this instruction includes, without limitation, source
     material, special nuclear material (SNM), and byproduct material including discrete
     naturally-occurring or accelerator-produced material (NARM). This instruction does not
     apply to nuclear reactor programs, nuclear weapons systems and fuel or waste, or any
     other material controlled under Section 91 of the AEA (1954) unless such materials are not
     covered by AFPD 91-1 or subordinate AFIs managed by AFSEC. The handling of Section
     91(b) waste from operations involving nuclear munitions maintenance is discussed in context
     within AFI 91-108, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Intrinsic Radiation and 91(B) Radioactive
     Material Safety Program.
     1.1.3. Objectives. The objectives of this AFI are to:
        1.1.3.1. Ensure the proper acquisition, possession, security, storage, use, transfer,
        disposal and transportation of RAM covered by this instruction.
        1.1.3.2. Establish a unified approach to the management and safeguarding of RAM used
        by the USAF, contractors, and other entities working on USAF installations world-wide.
        1.1.3.3. Implement a unified policy for authorizing the acquisition, possession, storage,
        use, transfer, disposal and transportation of RAM world-wide.
     1.1.4. Regulatory Authority for Radioactive Materials (RAM). This instruction implements
     NRC requirements across the USAF. It also sets requirements for USAF-owned RAM not
     under the jurisdiction of the NRC. The NRC is the primary regulatory authority for USAF
     use of RAM in the United States. In locations outside of the United States and its territories,
     the requirements in this instruction apply, so long as the requirements do not conflict with
     applicable requirements from any of the following: international agreements, the Overseas
     Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD), country-specific Final Governing
     Standards (FGS), Geographic Combatant Command policy, and environmental annexes to
     operational orders (OPORDS), operational plans (OPLANS) or other operational directive.
     International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safety Standards and other publications may be
     considered where appropriate.
     1.1.5. US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Regulatory Authority. The AEA of 1954,
     as amended (including the Energy Policy Act of 2005), and the Energy Reorganization Act
     of 1974 (Public Law 93-438), grant the NRC the authority to regulate byproduct material,
     discrete NARM, source material, and SNM for peaceful applications IAW42 U.S.C. §2011,
AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                 7


  Congressional Declaration of Policy, et seq. This authority does not extend to material
  described in Section 91 of the AEA (1954), or 42 U.S.C. §2121.
     1.1.5.1. NRC authority extends across the United States, its possessions and territories
     and Puerto Rico. For regulations issued and enforced by the NRC, reference Title 10 of
     the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter I Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
     1.1.5.2. The NRC maintains regulatory authority over Federal agency licensees
     regardless of location within the United States.
  1.1.6. USAF Regulatory Authority:
     1.1.6.1. Authority for USAF receipt, storage, internal distribution, use, transfer, and
     disposal of byproduct, discrete NARM, source, and limited quantities of SNM is granted
     through a Master Materials License (MML) issued to the USAF by the NRC. This
     instruction prescribes requirements for USAF compliance with the MML and other
     applicable regulatory requirements.
     1.1.6.2. The USAF also maintains authority over the use of RAM by non-USAF
     organizations on USAF installations where exclusive Federal jurisdiction exists. This
     AFI requires tenant organizations operating under a non-USAF permit, NRC license, or
     DOE license exemption to coordinate with the installation radiation safety officer (IRSO)
     on legal documentation, location, quantity and movement onto and across USAF-
     occupied real estate for RAM exceeding NRC exempt quantities and not falling under
     Section 91 of the AEA (1954). Non-USAF tenant organizations are not subject to
     AFIA/SG inspections.
     1.1.6.3. Authority for USAF receipt, use, storage, distribution and disposal of Section
     91(a) and 91(b) material is covered under AFPD 91-1, AFI 91-108, and AFI 91-110,
     Nuclear Safety Review and Launch Approval for Space or Missile Use of Radioactive
     Material and Nuclear Systems.
     1.1.6.4. USAF activities outside the US follow applicable laws and regulations of the
     host country concerning import, export, control, and disposal of RAM according to the
     Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), or similar document, with the host country. This
     AFI requires radiation safety standards and requirements followed by USAF
     organizations to be at least as stringent as those within the US. It also requires USAF
     installations located within the host nation to honor contractor host nation licenses for
     using RAM in like manner as an NRC or Agreement State License and otherwise IAW
     the SOFA. IAEA Safety Standards and other publications may be considered where
     appropriate.
  1.1.7. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).             RCRA authorizes the
  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and enforce regulations governing the
  cradle to grave management of hazardous waste. These regulations are found in Title 40 of
  the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR) Chapter I Environmental Protection Agency. For
  purposes of RCRA, take note of the following definition: Low-Level Mixed Waste (LLMW)
  is waste that contains both low-level radioactive waste and RCRA hazardous waste. Low-
  Level Radioactive Waste (LLW) is a radioactive waste which contains source, special
  nuclear, or byproduct material and is not classified as high-level radioactive waste,
  transuranic waste, spent nuclear fuel, or byproduct material. Mixed Waste (MW) means
8                                                          AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


    waste that contains both RCRA hazardous waste and source, special nuclear, or byproduct
    material. As such, MW is subject to dual regulation under EPA and NRC rules. However,
    40 CFR Part 266 Storage, Treatment, Transportation, and Disposal of Mixed-Waste, Subpart
    N (Part(s) 266.210 – 266.310), provides for conditional exemption from RCRA coverage for
    LLMW storage, treatment, transportation and disposal so long as the LLMW meets the
    Subpart N requirements.
       1.1.7.1. Solid low level radioactive waste (LLRW) includes quantities of byproduct,
       source and SNM. They also may contain NARM, and they too may fall within the
       definition of hazardous waste as set out in 40 CFR Part 261 Identification and Listing of
       Hazardous Waste.
       1.1.7.2. Waste that contains both AEA-regulated RAM and hazardous waste (as defined
       by 40 CFR 261.3) is termed mixed waste (40 CFR 266.210).
           1.1.7.2.1. The NRC regulates the byproduct, source, and SNM constituents.
           1.1.7.2.2. EPA regulates the hazardous chemical and non-NRC regulated
           constituents.
           1.1.7.2.3. Neither agency has exclusive jurisdiction over mixed waste under current
           Federal law.
           1.1.7.2.4. Generators of mixed waste fall under the authority of both NRC and EPA
           regulations unless exempted by those regulations. Refer to 40 CFR Parts 261 and
           266, Subpart N; AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program
           Planning and Operations; AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality, and subordinate
           publications; and AFPD 48-1, Aerospace Medicine Enterprise, and subordinate
           publications, for guidance on USAF compliance with EPA hazardous materials
           regulations.
    1.1.8. Clean Air Act (CAA). The CAA gives the EPA authority over non-NRC regulated
    radionuclide emissions from Federal facilities. For applicable regulations, reference 40 CFR
    Part 61, Subpart I, National Emission Standards for Radionuclide Emissions from Facilities
    Licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Federal Facilities Not Covered by
    Subpart H. NRC regulates air emissions from NRC licensed Federal facilities IAW 10 CFR
    20.1101(d). Organizations that generate emissions fall under the authority of both NRC and
    EPA rules. For guidance on complying with EPA air emission standards, refer to AFPD 32-
    70 and AFI 32-7040, Air Quality Compliance and Resource Management.
    1.1.9. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
    (CERCLA). Section 103 of CERCLA requires notification of the National Response Center
    immediately at 1-800-424-8802 in the event a release of greater than the reportable quantity
    of a hazardous substance is released to the environment. A list of applicable reportable
    quantities for radionuclides can be found in 40 CFR 302.4, Appendix B-Radionuclides.
    Note: Installation Civil Engineering (CE) in coordination with the IRSO and the Installation
    Commander should notify the National Response Center; the IRSO in coordination with CE
    and the Installation Commander should notify the RICS which will in turn notify the NRC.
    1.1.10. Emergency Planning and Community-Right-To-Know-Act (EPCRA). EPCRA
    requires that whenever a reportable quantity of a CERCLA hazardous substance leaves
AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                   9


  installation boundaries, the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) and Local
  Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) must be notified immediately (40 CFR Part 355,
  Emergency Planning and Notification). Note that EPCRA is not, by its terms, applicable to
  Federal facilities. The USAF complies with EPCRA, as directed by Executive Order 13514
  (October 5, 2009). Note: Installation CE in coordination with the IRSO and the Installation
  Commander should notify the SERC and LEPC; the IRSO in coordination with CE and the
  Installation Commander should notify the RICS which will in turn notify the NRC.
  1.1.11. Transportation of Hazardous Material (HAZMAT).                The Department of
  Transportation (DOT) specifies requirements for marking, labeling, shipping documents,
  containers, and other requirements when shipping or transporting hazardous materials
  (HAZMAT), including RAM, IAW Title 49 of the United States Code (49 U.S.C.), Chapter
  51, Transportation of Hazardous Material, and Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations
  (49 CFR) Chapter I Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. In the USAF,
  the logistics (A4) community ensures the appropriate handling, packaging and certification of
  RAM shipments IAW Defense Transportation Regulations (DTR) 4500.9-R-Part II, Chapter
  204, Hazardous Material, and Chapter 208, Packaging and Handling; AFI 24-210 (I),
  Package of Hazardous Material; Air Force Joint Instruction (AFJI) 23-504, Radioactive
  Commodities in the DOD Supply System; Air Force Joint Manual (AFJMAN) 23-209,
  Storage and Handling of Hazardous Materials; AFMAN 24-204 (I), Preparing Hazardous
  Materials for Military Air Shipments; and International Air Transport Association (IATA),
  Dangerous Goods Regulation. IAEA Safety Standards, including Regulations for the Safe
  Transport of Radioactive Material, and other publications may be considered where
  appropriate. Note: Acknowledging CERCLA Reportable Quantities is a component of
  HAZMAT transportation requirements.
  1.1.12. Radioactive Material Licensing Categories. This instruction stipulates that all RAM
  (with the exception of 91(a) and 91(b) material) will be regulated using the policies and
  procedures in this instruction and in the MML as identified in paragraph 1.1.6.
     1.1.12.1. Specifically Licensed RAM. Many activities with RAM require a specific
     license with the NRC whereby detailed information is provided on the activity, RAM
     involved, organization, responsible radiation safety officer, etc. In a similar manner, the
     USAF issues specific permits for these activities accomplished with NRC-licensed
     materials within the USAF. Most USAF permits are template types, which are those
     issued for devices or applications that pose little radiological risk and employ
     standardized permit conditions. USAF non-template permits are for activities or
     applications that pose higher radiological risks and those that do not employ standardized
     permit conditions.
     1.1.12.2. Generally Licensed Devices (GLDs) containing RAM. The Code of Federal
     Regulations provides a general license for the use of RAM contained in certain products.
     This allows persons to receive and use devices containing these radioactive materials if
     the device has been manufactured and distributed IAW a specific license issued by the
     NRC or by an Agreement State. Most GLDs possessed by USAF units/organizations do
     not require permits, though the USAF does permit some GLDs, as described in this
     instruction. If a permit is not required by the USAF for a particular device, this
     instruction lists other requirements for the possessing unit/organization, the most
 10                                                      AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


       important of which is the need to enter GLDs in the Radioactive Materials Management
       Information System (RAMMIS).
       1.1.12.3. Exempted RAM. Certain concentrations or quantities of RAM are exempt
       from specific and general licensing requirements of the NRC. USAF units/organizations
       have restrictions on the disposition of exempt quantities of RAM, as detailed in this
       instruction and 10 CFR 30.70, Schedule A, or 30.71, Schedule B.
1.2. USAF Acceptance, Transfer, Storage, or Use of Radioactive Materials. This AFI
requires all USAF units to accept, transfer, store or use RAM excluding 91(b) nuclear systems
IAW this instruction, RAM permit conditions, and RICS guidance.
AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                   11

     exemption only applies to the requirements of a permit, and not the other requirements
     specified in 10 CFR Parts 19 and 20 (e.g., radiation dose standards, reporting, disposal).
     3.3.2.3. Source material (uranium or thorium) IAW 10 CFR 40.22. Note: The source
     material is generally licensed and USAF organizations obtaining source material under
     10 CFR 40.22 are not exempt from the requirements of 10 CFR Parts 19, 20, and 21 since
     the USAF possesses source material under a specific license (reference 10 CFR
     40.22(b)).
     3.3.2.4. GLDs, when managed according to 10 CFR 31.3, 31.5, 31.7, 31.10, or 31.11.

  must have an NRC or Agreement State license with a current NRC Form 241 authorizing
AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    39


   transfer and use on the installation and written approval from the installation commander’s
   appointed approval authority, normally the IRSO (10 CFR Part 150.20(b).1). (T-0)
   3.3.4. DOE organizations and DOE prime contractors must certify, in writing, that they are
   exempt from NRC licensing requirements. (T-2)
3.4. Requesting Permits, Amendments, and Other Authorizations for RAM Use.
   3.4.1. There are two types of USAF RAM permits: Template and Non-Template.
      3.4.1.1. Template permits are issued for devices or applications that pose relatively little
      radiological risk and employ standardized permit conditions.
      3.4.1.2. Non-Template permits are issued to organizations that involve significant
      amounts of sealed or unsealed RAM and pose greater than minimal radiological risk.
      These permits mandate detailed radiation protection programs and terms and conditions
      for use. Examples include nuclear medicine clinics, radioactive waste sites, research
      laboratories or other unique applications where standard permit conditions are not
      appropriate.
   3.4.2. Initial applications for permits are prepared and submitted through the IRSO to the
   RICS with a courtesy copy to the MAJCOM Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE) IAW current
   guidance provided by the RICS, e.g. RIC website content. (T-1) Contact the RICS if an
   immediate mission critical permit or amendment is required. (T-1)
      3.4.2.1. The RICS can provide prescribed NRC forms, copies of regulatory guides, and
      additional guidance on the administrative aspects of permits. NRC forms and regulatory
      guides are also available through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission at
      http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/.
      3.4.2.2. Permit applications require the signature of the Permittee on an NRC Form 313
      and appointment of a PRSO and, if possible, an alternate PRSO. (T-1) This application
      must be sent to the RICS, NOT THE NRC! (T-1)
      3.4.2.3. Organizations planning new or unique applications of RAM must contact the
      RICS as early as possible to decide the scope of the permit and the need for a site visit by
      the permit action officer. (T-2)
      3.4.2.4. Plans for new facilities must be approved by the RICS, prior to construction, if

                                   INSPECTION POLICY

A6.1. Introduction. The inspection program for permitted and generally licensed RAM serves
to assess compliance with permit conditions, this instruction and Federal regulations (e.g., NRC
and DOT). The frequency and duration of the inspection shall be based on the inspection priority
assigned by the RICS, complexity of the permit, overall risks of the permitted activity, and
opportunity to witness infrequent or unique procedures.
A6.2. Inspection Protocol.
   A6.2.1. Inspections of permits shall be conducted by the Air Force Inspection Agency,
   Medical Operations Directorate (AFIA/SG), the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
   (NRC), AFMSA/SG3PB, or collaboratively. Inspections are conducted IAW NRC
   Inspection Manual Chapter 2800, Materials Inspection Program, and as necessary, may
   apply a "prescriptive" evaluation to ensure the implementing conditions of this instruction are
   accomplished. (ref. MML and NRC Inspection Manual Chapter 2800)
   A6.2.2. Inspections by either organization shall avoid interference with the Permittee’s
   operational obligations; however, a Permittee shall not delay inspections based on
   inconvenience. Note: 10 CFR 30.52 states, "Each licensee shall afford to the NRC at all
   reasonable times the opportunity to inspect byproduct material and the premises and facilities
   wherein byproduct material is used or stored. (T-0) Each licensee shall make available to the
   NRC for inspection, upon reasonable notice, records kept by him." (T-0) This access shall
   also be afforded to AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB. (T-1) Permittees failing to submit to or
   afford an inspection may be issued a violation for non-compliance.
   A6.2.3. The AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB inspector shall be in uniform; credentialed with a
   DOD common access card (CAC); and either possess a badge, orders, authorization letter or
   a list of telephone numbers from which the Permittee may call for verification. The inspector
   shall have a clearance verified in the Joint Clearance and Access Verification System
   (JCAVS). The NRC shall have identification and, as necessary, be able to demonstrate
   appropriate clearance. The Permittee has a right and duty to challenge unknown individuals
   presenting themselves as inspectors.
   A6.2.4. Inspections are generally conducted on-site and unannounced IAW AFI 90-201.
   Inspections may be conducted at times outside of normal duty hours, particularly when the
   use or receipt of permitted material is conducted. A valid inspection involves AFIA/SG or
   AFMSA/SG3PB contact with the Permittee, PRSO or responsible (cognizant) individual
   using material covered by the permit. Inspections that cannot be conducted due to
   operational obligations or the unavailability of applicable personnel may be rescheduled if
   coordinated with AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB.
   A6.2.5. A unit that has deployed the PRSO and does not have an available alternate PRSO is
   still subject to inspection. The permit shall be revised to possession only during the PRSO
   deployment and an administrative officer should be named to the permit. (T-1) Failure to
   comply with the conditions of the permit, this instruction or applicable Federal regulations
   may result in a violation for non-compliance, particularly if permitted material is not properly
   secured and controlled.
AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    87


   A6.2.6. Neither AFIA/SG nor AFMSA/SG3PB is required to pre-inspect any unit prior to an
   NRC inspection. Units are expected to be in compliance at all times.
   A6.2.7. Telephonic inspections by AFIA have been discontinued and will no longer be used.
   A6.2.8. Stop Action. During the course of an inspection, AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB may
   determine a procedure or practice to be imminently dangerous to life and health (IDLH). In
   those cases, the inspector shall require the Permittee to temporarily cease operations until
   corrective action is taken. As necessary, the RICS shall be contacted. The inspector shall
   not ask the Permittee to perform a task that is hazardous, in contravention to the permit, this
   instruction, Federal regulations or has potential to disrupt operational activities.
   A6.2.9. The AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB inspector shall offer to conduct an out-brief with
   the PRSO, Permittee or cognizant individual(s). The out-brief shall include discussion of the
   inspection scope, contacts, results, and preliminary rating. In cases where the inspection
   reveals significant findings or Severity Level I-III violation(s), an out-brief with the
   Permittee and his/her commander shall be mandatory.                AFIA/SG will contact
   AFMSA/SG3PB prior to the out-brief of these type of findings. Following an inspection,
   AFIA/SG may request clarifying or additional information from the Permittee.
   A6.2.10. AFIA/SG shall generate a final report and assign a rating in 60 duty days. The
   Permittee must initiate corrective actions in advance of any report. At a minimum, the final
   report shall be submitted to the Permittee, RICS, and the Permittee’s MAJCOM/IG and SG.
A6.3. Inspection Types.
   A6.3.1. New permit inspections shall be conducted approximately six months after permitted
   materials are received. Permittees are required to immediately notify AFIA/SG when
   permitted materials have been received. (MML & NRC Inspection Manual Chapter 2800)
   A6.3.2. Routine permit inspection shall be conducted at intervals established by the permit
   or as established in NUREG 1556, Volume 20. Inspection frequency may be changed based
   on Permittee performance. (MML & NRC Inspection Manual Chapter 2800)
   A6.3.3. Follow-up permit inspections shall be conducted when Permittees receive NRC
   Severity Level I-III violations. Such may also be requested by the RIC. They will occur no
   later than six months following closure of corrective actions.
   A6.3.4. Collaborative permit inspections: AFIA/SG may choose to accompany the NRC
   during an inspection. NRC inspections may occur at any time and are not bound by the
   intervals established by the permit or recentness of the last AFIA/SG inspection. Conversely,
   the NRC may choose to accompany AFIA/SG during an inspection. Typically, the NRC
   does not issue a report under these conditions.
   A6.3.5. Incident inspections may be conducted based on concern expressed by the RICS, the
   NRC or following a significant event (e.g., personnel health and safety violations, loss of
   control of RAM, radiation exposure exceeding regulatory guidelines, natural disaster or
   equipment failures). In these instances, AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB may conduct an off-
   cycle visit or inspection either unannounced or scheduled. This type of inspection is
   generally not rated but a report may be generated.
   A6.3.6. Consultancy inspections, upon request of the Permittee, AFIA/SG or
   AFMSA/SG3PB, may conduct a scheduled visit to identify areas where assistance and
 88                                                          AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


   improvements can be made. Furthermore, AFIA/SG or AFMSA/SG3PB may conduct a
   scheduled visit to advise the Permittee on how to implement new AFIs or Federal
   regulations. Consultancy visits, requested by the Permittee, are generally funded by the
   requesting organization. This type of visit shall not be rated but a report should be generated.
   A6.3.7. Permit termination inspections: a termination inspection may be scheduled and
   conducted during or following the termination of a broad scope permit, remediation
   activity or permitted activity involving significant amounts of unsealed RAM, to assure the
   criteria of 10 CFR Part 20, Subpart E are met. This type of inspection shall not be rated but a
   report may be generated.
   A6.3.8. Special emphasis inspections: certain topics to be researched, as requested by the
   RICS are conducted by AFIA/SG. These Special Emphasis Item (SEI) studies are conducted
   according to AFI 90-201. SEIs are normally terminated within 6-12 months, and the results
   are briefed at the annual IG-SG Annual Review.
   A6.3.9. Other: wherever there is geographic clustering of permits, it may be advantageous
   for AFIA/SG to accelerate the date of the next inspection. This predominantly applies to
   permits with a 5 or 7-year inspection frequency and within one or two years of their next
   inspection. This would serve to align the inspection frequency of similar permits in a
   geographic region to reduce repetitive travel.
A6.4. Severity Levels of Violations.
   A6.4.1. AF-issued violations have been generally cross-referenced to NRC categories and
   severity levels. Since regulatory requirements have varying degrees of safety, safeguards, or
   environmental significance, violations of given requirements have differing levels of
   significance that are represented by the severity levels.
   A6.4.2. Comparisons of severity between disparate activities (e.g., nuclear medicine vs.
   gauges) will not be made. Severity is assigned on a case-by-case basis. Repeat violations,
   willfulness and false representations will influence the severity of a violation.
   A6.4.3. Minor violations are less severe than those defined as Severity Level IV violations.
   A response with corrective actions is required to be submitted IAW paragraphs A6.5 and
   A6.7 (T-1) Examples might include:
       A6.4.3.1. Lapse in inventory/transfer records without loss of material.
       A6.4.3.2. Lapse in PRSO appointment or expired permit without impact on safety.
   A6.4.4. Severity Level IV violations involve non-compliance with NRC requirements, non-
   compliance with permit conditions, this instruction, or Federal regulations and pose an
   increased but generally minimal risk to safety and health. A Permittee response with
   corrective actions is required to be submitted IAW paragraphs A6.5 and A6.7 (T-1)
   AFIA/SG may recommend the RICS close violations in advance of enforcement if corrective
   actions can be demonstrated during the inspection or within five (5) duty days
   thereafter. Examples include:
       A6.4.4.1. Failure to maintain and implement radiation programs to keep radiation
       exposures ALARA, and/or
AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                   89


      A6.4.4.2. Information that the NRC requires be kept by a Permittee and that is
      incomplete or inaccurate and of more than minor significance (e.g., area survey records).
   A6.4.5. Severity Level III violations are cause for regulatory concern as violations of this
   nature pose a significant risk to safety, health and/or security of permitted RAM. The
   Permittee shall immediately contact (within 24 hours) the RICS following the violation
   notification/issuance by AFIA/SG. (T-1) A response with corrective actions is required to be
   submitted IAW paragraphs A6.5 and A6.7. (T-1) Examples include:
      A6.4.5.1. Conduct of licensee activities by a technically unqualified person, and/or
      A6.4.5.2. Delay in notifying the RIC upon loss of RAM.
   A6.4.6. Severity Level II violations involve actual or high potential consequence to public
   health, worker safety, and/or control of RAM. The Permittee shall immediately contact
   (within 24 hours) the RICS following the violation notification/issuance by AFIA/SG. (T-1)
   A response with corrective actions is required to be submitted to the RICS within five (5)
   duty days of Permittee’s receipt of the report. A response with corrective actions is required
   to be submitted IAW paragraphs A6.5 and A6.7 (T-1) Examples include:
      A6.4.6.1. A radiation exposure of a declared pregnant worker during the gestational
      period in excess of 1.0 rem TEDE, and/or
      A6.4.6.2. "Significant information identified by a Permittee" and not provided to
      AFIA/SG or the RIC because of careless disregard on the part of the PRSO.
   A6.4.7. Severity Level I violations involve actual or high potential consequences to public
   health, worker safety, and/or control of RAM but is deemed more significant than a Severity
   Level II violation by the inspector. The Permittee shall immediately contact (within 24
   hours) the RICS following the violation notification/issuance by AFIA/SG. (T-1) A response
   with corrective actions is required to be submitted to the RICS within five (5) duty days of
   Permittee’s receipt of the report. A response with corrective actions is required to be
   submitted IAW paragraphs A6.5 and A6.7 (T-1) Examples include:
      A6.4.7.1. An annual exposure of a member of the public in excess of 1.0 rem TEDE,
      and/or
      A6.4.7.2. Inaccurate or incomplete information provided to AFIA/SG, RIC or the NRC
      in a deliberate nature, under official pretense and knowing such was incomplete.
A6.5. Inspection Violations and Actions.
   A6.5.1. Minor. Permittees shall have five (5) duty days from the receipt of the report to
   respond in writing to the RICS, AFIA/SG and their respective MAJCOM. (T-1) The RIC/S
   reserves the right to accelerate the time of the response. The RIC/S may take enforcement
   against a Permittee who doesn’t demonstrate timeliness or sufficiency of corrective actions.
   A6.5.2. Severity Level IV. Permittees shall have five (5) duty days from the receipt of the
   report to respond in writing to the RICS, AFIA/SG and their respective MAJCOM. (T-1)
   The RIC/S reserves the right to accelerate the time of the response. The RICS may take
   enforcement against a Permittee who doesn’t demonstrate timeliness or sufficiency of
   corrective actions.
 90                                                            AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


   A6.5.3. Severity Level I-III. Permittees shall have five (5) duty days from the receipt of the
   report to respond in writing to the RICS, AFIA/SG and their respective MAJCOM. (T-1)
   Permittees shall respond by email or in writing, within 24 hours upon verbal notification or
   report, whichever occurs first, to the RICS; the Permittee shall provide immediate actions
   taken to mitigate the violation. (T-1) The RIC/S reserves the right to accelerate the time of
   the response. The RIC/S may take enforcement against a Permittee who doesn’t demonstrate
   timeliness or sufficiency of corrective actions.
   A6.5.4. Stop Action: during the course of an inspection, AFIA/SG may determine a
   procedure or practice to be imminently dangerous to life and health (IDLH). In those cases,
   the inspector shall require the Permittee to temporarily cease operations (Stop Action) until
   corrective action is taken. The RICS shall be contacted as necessary. The inspector shall not
   ask the Permittee to perform a task that is hazardous, in contravention to the permit, this
   instruction, Federal regulations or has potential to disrupt operational activities.
   A6.5.5. The AFIA/SG inspector shall offer to conduct an out-brief with the PRSO, Permittee
   or cognizant individual(s). In cases where the inspection reveals significant findings or
   Severity Level I-III violation(s), an out-brief with the Permittee and his/her commander shall
   be mandatory. Moreover, AFIA/SG will contact the RICS prior to the out- brief of these
   types of findings. Following an inspection, AFIA/SG may call the Permittee for clarifying
   information. Unless in conflict with this section, AFIA/SG shall generate a final report and
   assign a rating in 60 duty days. The Permittee must initiate corrective actions in advance of
   any report. (T-1)
   A6.5.6. At a minimum, the final report shall be submitted to the Permittee, the RICS, and the
   Permittee’s MAJCOM/SG.
   A6.5.7. On a quarterly basis, AFIA/SG shall provide the RIC a summary of inspection
   findings.
A6.6. Ratings. AFIA/SG will issue either a rating of “Compliant” or “Not Fully Compliant” in
the final report. Inspections that are Not Fully Compliant will report corrective actions to
violations IAW paragraphs A6.5 and A6.7. Whereas there may be no RAM or performance
objectives to evaluate, a rating will not be issued.
A6.7. Corrective Actions. When a violation is issued during an inspection, corrective actions
shall commence promptly. (T-1) Permittees shall respond to the violations according to the
provisions of this attachment. (T-1) The Permittee shall decide if the response needs to be
coordinated with higher authorities. (T-1) Response to violations shall contain, at a minimum,
the following:
   A6.7.1. Reference to the violation(s). (T-1)
   A6.7.2. Complete description of how the violations(s) were or will be corrected to include:
   (T-1)
       A6.7.2.1. The root cause for the violation(s) or, if contested, the basis for disputing it,
       A6.7.2.2. Corrective actions that have been taken and the results achieved,
       A6.7.2.3. Corrective actions that will be taken to avoid future violations, and
AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     91


       A6.7.2.4. Timeline, with milestones, for corrective actions and date when full
       compliance was or will be achieved.
   A6.7.3. Designation of an office for monitoring corrective measures, to include a point of
   contact. (T-1)
   A6.7.4. Signature of the Permittee: “For” signatures shall not be accepted without
   certification the Permittee is aware of the corrective actions. (T-1) A statement to that fact
   shall be placed in the body of the response letter. (T-1) All letters shall be dated. (T-1)
   A6.7.5. Corrective actions to separate violations shall not be commingled. (T-1) Each
   violation shall be addressed separately. (T-1) However, reference to a specific corrective
   action from another violation can made if such would resolve both violations.
A6.8. Rebuttal. If the Permittee believes a violation to be invalid, then a written rebuttal shall
be submitted to the RICS within 30 duty days of receipt of the violation. (T-1) The rebuttal shall
include reasons for rebuttal and reference the permit, AFIs or Federal regulations as appropriate.
(T-1) An unsupported opinion or supposition that corrective action is unattainable due to
external constraints may not be acceptable to close the matter.
A6.9. Disposition.
   A6.9.1. Closure: upon receipt of a response to the violation from the Permittee, the RICS
   shall consider the merit of the corrective actions and, if satisfied, render a closure letter. A
   closure letter shall be submitted to the Permittee and copied, at a minimum, to their
   MAJCOM/SG and AFIA/SG.
   A6.9.2. Non-Closure: if the RIC/S determines corrective actions are not acceptable to close
   the violations, enforcement actions may be taken according to Attachment 7. Enforcement
   actions shall be submitted to the Permittee and copied, at a minimum, to their MAJCOM/SG
   and AFIA/SG.

                                         Attachment 7
                               RIC ENFORCEMENT POLICY

A7.1. Introduction and Basic Enforcement Actions. This section describes the enforcement
actions available to the RIC/S in the administration of the USAF MML, and specifies the
conditions under which each may be used. The basic enforcement actions are Notices of
Violation and Orders of various types. Enforcement action is usually taken whenever a violation
of permit requirements or regulations of more than a minor concern is identified. The nature and
extent of the enforcement action is intended to reflect the seriousness of the violation involved.
For the vast majority of violations, a Notice of Violation (NOV) is the usual action. NOVs are
sent to the Permittee, with copies to AFIA/SG (when not issued by AFIA), and MAJCOM
Bioenvironmental Engineer. They specify the nature of the violation(s) (e.g., permit condition,
permit tie-down, this instruction, or Federal regulations) and require a response for corrective
action by a set date. The RIC/S shall, in the administration of the MML, keep the assigned NRC
Program Manager informed regarding enforcement actions.
A7.2. Escalated Enforcement Actions, RIC and RIC Secretariat Directives. Whenever
inspections identify conditions or violations that result in significant regulatory concern,
escalated enforcement action through an issued directive is considered. As authorized by this
instruction and AFPD 40-2, a directive is a mandatory written order to modify, suspend, or to
cease and desist from a given practice or activity; or to take additional action as deemed
appropriate. Directives may be issued in lieu of, or in addition to NOVs, generally for Severity
Level I, II, or III violations or other conditions that cause significant regulatory concern.
Directives are mandatory and made effective immediately. Directives may be executed without
prior notice or consultation with the Permittee whenever it is determined that the public health,
interest, or safety requires, or when the order is responding to a violation involving willful
negligence. For other cases, the Permittee shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate why
the order should not be issued. Directives may be issued as follows:
   A7.2.1. Permit Modification Orders are issued by the RIC/S when a change in Permittee
   equipment, procedures, personnel, or management controls is necessary.
   A7.2.2. Suspension Orders are issued by the RICS and signed by AF/SG3P and may apply
   to all or part of the permitted activity. Ordinarily, a permitted activity is not suspended (nor
   is a suspension prolonged) for failure to comply with requirements where such failure is not
   of willful intent and adequate corrective action has been taken. Suspension Orders may be
   used to remove a threat to the public health and safety, or the environment:
       A7.2.2.1. When the Permittee has not responded adequately to other enforcement action;
       A7.2.2.2. When the Permittee interferes with the conduct of an inspection or
       investigation; or
       A7.2.2.3. For any reason not mentioned above for which permit activity suspension is
       authorized by the RIC/S in coordination with AF/SG3P.
   A7.2.3. Revocation/Termination Orders are issued by RIC/S and signed by AF/SG3P:
       A7.2.3.1. When a Permittee is unable or unwilling to comply with permit requirements;
       A7.2.3.2. When a Permittee refuses to correct a violation;
AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     93


      A7.2.3.3. When a Permittee does not respond to a NOV when a response was required
      by the RICS; or
      A7.2.3.4. For any other reason for which revocation is authorized by the RIC/S in
      coordination with AF/SG3P (i.e., any condition that would warrant refusal of a permit on
      an original application).
   A7.2.4. Cease and Desist Orders are issued by the RIC/S and may be used to stop an
   unauthorized activity that continues after being notified by the RICS that the activity has
   been deemed unauthorized.
   A7.2.5. Confirmatory Action Letters are issued by the RICS confirming a Permittee’s
   agreement to take certain actions to eliminate significant concerns about health and safety,
   safeguards, or the environment.
   A7.2.6. Demands for Information are mandated requests of information from Permittees or
   other persons for the purpose of enabling the RICS to determine whether an order or other
   enforcement action should be issued. Demands for Information may be issued by either the
   RIC or the RICS.
   A7.2.7. Other Orders: in addition to the Orders describe above, Orders may be issued to
   Permittees that include but are not limited to:
      A7.2.7.1. Divert facility financial resources to purchase, replace, or excess and dispose
      of certain equipment;
      A7.2.7.2. Increase the frequency of facility safety committee meetings;
      A7.2.7.3. Implement meetings between the facility executive management and the RSO
      on a frequent and routine basis;
      A7.2.7.4. Perform additional or supplemental training to Permittee staff;
      A7.2.7.5. Increase frequencies of facility internal audits or other internal surveillance;
      and/or
      A7.2.7.6. Appear before the RIC to present corrective actions and associated
      implementation timelines.
A7.3. Factors Impacting Escalated Enforcement Actions.
   A7.3.1. Initial Escalated Action: When the RIC/S is made aware of conditions or violations
   where escalated enforcement action may be necessary, deliberations are held to determine the
   severity level of the findings and factors that may affect that level. Serious findings will
   often include deliberations with the NRC. If it is established that a willful Severity Level III
   violation or problem has occurred, and the Permittee has not had any previous escalated
   actions (regardless of the activity area) during the past to (2) years or two (2) inspection
   cycles, whichever is longer, the RIC/S will consider whether the Permittee’s corrective action
   for the noted violation or problem is reasonably prompt and comprehensive. The starting
   point of this period shall be considered the date when the Permittee was put on notice to take
   corrective action.
   A7.3.2. Credit for Actions Related to Identification: If a Severity Level I or II violation or a
   willful Severity Level III violation has occurred, or if, during the past two (2) years or two
94                                                          AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


  (2) inspection cycles, whichever is longer, and the Permittee has been issued at least one
  other escalated action, the escalated enforcement actions shall consider the factor of
  identification in addition to corrective action.      The decision on identification requires
  considering all the circumstances of identification including:
     A7.3.2.1. Whether the problem requiring corrective action was AFIA/SG-identified,
     RICS-identified, Permittee-identified, or discovered through an event;
     A7.3.2.2. Whether prior opportunities existed to identify the problem requiring
     corrective action and if so, the age and number of those opportunities;
     A7.3.2.3. Whether the problem was discovered as the result of a Permittee’s self-
     monitoring effort, such as conducting an audit, a test, a surveillance, a design review, or
     troubleshooting;
     A7.3.2.4. For a problem discovered through an event, the ease of discovery, and the
     degree of Permittee initiative in identifying the root cause of the problem and any
     associated violations;
     A7.3.2.5. For AFIA/SG identified issues, whether the Permittee would have likely
     identified the issue in the same time-period if the Agency had not been involved;
     A7.3.2.6. For AFIA/SG identified issues, whether the Permittee should have identified
     the issue (and taken action) earlier; and
     A7.3.2.7. For cases in which AFIA/SG identifies the overall problem requiring
     corrective action (i.e., a programmatic issue), the degree of Permittee initiative or lack of
     initiative in identifying the problem or problems requiring corrective action.
  A7.3.3. Prompt and Comprehensive Corrective Action is required for all MML violations.
  (T-0) In most cases, the RICS does not propose escalated enforcement actions where the
  Permittee promptly identifies and comprehensively corrects violations. However, a Severity
  Level III violation or higher will almost always result in escalated enforcement actions if a
  Permittee does not take prompt and comprehensive corrective actions to address the
  violation. The following factors are considered:
     A7.3.3.1. Timeliness and Extent of Corrective Action.
         A7.3.3.1.1. Consideration will be given to the:
             A7.3.3.1.1.1. Timeliness of the corrective action (including the promptness in
             developing the schedule for long term corrective action);
             A7.3.3.1.1.2. Adequacy of the Permittee’s root cause analysis for the violation;
             and
             A7.3.3.1.1.3. Comprehensive nature of the corrective action (i.e., whether the
             action is focused narrowly to the specific violation or broadly to the general area
             of concern).
         A7.3.3.1.2. Whether or not the Permittee has taken immediate actions necessary,
         upon discovery of a violation, that will restore safety, and return the permit to full
         compliance; and
AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    95


          A7.3.3.1.3. Whether or not the Permittee has developed and implemented lasting
          actions that will not only prevent recurrence of the violation, but will be
          comprehensive enough, given the significance and complexity of the violation, to
          prevent occurrence of violations with similar root causes.
      A7.3.3.2. Adequacy of Corrective Actions: AFIA/SG will assist the RICS to determine
      adequacy of correction actions to violations. The RICS shall determine the adequacy of
      corrective actions to violations that are self-identified, result from an event, or are MML
      identified. The judgment of the adequacy of corrective actions may also occur at the time
      of an enforcement conference (i.e., by outlining substantive additional areas where
      corrective action is needed).
      A7.3.3.3. Corrective Action Process: the following shall be used for developing and
      implementing corrective actions. Corrective action shall be comprehensive enough to not
      only prevent recurrence of the violation at issue, but also to prevent occurrence of similar
      violations. These items should help in focusing broad corrective actions to the general
      area of concern rather than to specific violations. The actions that need to be taken are
      dependent on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. The corrective action
      process should involve the following steps:
          A7.3.3.3.1. Conduct a complete and thorough review of the circumstances that led to
          the violation;
          A7.3.3.3.2. Identify the root cause of the violation; and
          A7.3.3.3.3. Take prompt and comprehensive corrective action that will address the
          immediate concerns and prevent recurrence of the violation.
A7.4. Enforcement Conferences.
   A7.4.1. When a Permittee has been issued an NOV and fails to conform to effective
   corrective actions, the RIC/S may decide to initiate an enforcement conference with the
   Permittee to define the actions necessary to begin effective corrective measures to the
   violation. The RIC/S will issue official correspondence to the Permittee informing them of
   the enforcement conference. The enforcement conference can be implemented by any
   necessary means to affect a productive dialogue between the Permittee and the RIC/S.
   A7.4.2. The purpose of the conference is for the RIC/S to gather the necessary facts and
   information from the Permittee in order to make an informed decision about the violation.
   Objectives of the conference will include determining:
      A7.4.2.1. The root cause and analysis of the violation(s);
      A7.4.2.2. That a Permittee’s response is deemed timely and appropriate; and
      A7.4.2.3. That corrective actions to prevent similar recurrence of the violation(s) have
      been taken.
   A7.4.3. Results of the enforcement conference will be formalized by the RICS with
   correspondence to the Permittee describing the actions the Permittee must perform to resolve
   the violation(s).
A7.5. Appealing Enforcement Actions. The Permittee or any other person adversely affected
by an NOV or Order may appeal said action. The Permittee may submit an appeal via official
 96                                                            AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


correspondence to the RIC/S for the violations and findings. The Permittee must provide ample
regulatory justification in the correspondence to warrant an appeal of the violations. (T-1) The
RIC/S shall review the appeal by the Permittee and decide actions to be taken based on the merit
of the request, corrective actions taken by the Permittee, and the severity levels of the violations.
The RIC/S may at its option, initiate a review of Permittee program operations concerning the
enforcement action, grant the appeal to mitigate the severity level of the violation and/or
enforcement actions, or deny the appeal.
A7.6. NRC Related Administrative Actions. In addition to the enforcement actions by the
RIC/S, the NRC also uses administrative actions, such as Notices of Violation, Notice of
Deviation, Notices of Nonconformance, Confirmatory Action Letters, Letters of Reprimand, and
Demands for Information to supplement its enforcement program. The NRC may issue orders
and impose civil penalties for violations of NRC regulations and MML conditions. Note that any
notice of violation involving radiological working conditions, proposed imposition of civil
penalty, or order issued and any response must be posted by the Permittee IAW 10 CFR
19.11(a)(4).
   A7.6.1. Civil Penalty: only the NRC may impose civil penalties. A civil penalty is a
   monetary penalty that may be imposed by the NRC for violation of certain specified
   licensing provisions of the Atomic Energy Act or supplementary NRC rules or orders, any
   requirement for which a MML permit or NRC license may be revoked, reporting
   requirements under Section 206 of the Energy Reorganization Act, and NRC Regulations and
   MML program conditions. If the application of the normal guidance in this policy does not
   result in an appropriate sanction, as warranted, then the NRC may apply its full enforcement
   authority where the action is warranted. NRC action may include civil penalties, issuing
   appropriate orders, and assessing civil penalties for continuing violations on a per day basis,
   up to the NRC limit per violation.
   A7.6.2. Mitigation of Enforcement Actions: the NRC may exercise discretion and refrain
   from enforcement action, if the outcome of the normal process described in this policy does
   not result in a sanction consistent with an appropriate regulatory message. In addition, even
   if the NRC exercises this discretion, when the Permittee failed to make a required report to
   AFIA/SG or the RIC/S, a separate enforcement action may be issued for the Permittee’s
   failure to make a required report.
A7.7. Enforcement Actions Involving Individuals. An enforcement action against an
individual will be taken only when the RIC/S is satisfied that the individual fully understood, or
should have understood, his or her responsibility; knew, or should have known, the required
actions; and knowingly, or with careless disregard (i.e., with more than mere negligence) failed
to take required actions which have actual or potential safety significance. Transgressions of
individuals at the level of Severity Level III or IV violations will be handled by citing the facility
Permittee with a requirement that specific actions concerning the individual be taken.
   A7.7.1. Management Failures: action against an individual will not be taken if it
   demonstrates that the improper action by the individual was caused by management failures.
   The following are examples of situations to illustrate this concept but do not represent all
   potential cases:
       A7.7.1.1. Inadvertent individual mistakes resulting from inadequate training or guidance
       provided by the Permittee;
AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    97


       A7.7.1.2. Inadvertently missing an insignificant procedural requirement when the action
       is routine, fairly uncomplicated, and there is no unusual circumstance indicating that the
       procedures should be referred to and followed step-by-step;
       A7.7.1.3. Compliance with an express direction of management that resulted in a
       violation unless the individual did not express his or her concern or objection to the
       direction; or
       A7.7.1.4. Individual error directly resulting from following the technical advice of an
       expert (e.g., advisor or subcontractor) unless the advice was clearly unreasonable and the
       permitted individual should have recognized it as such.
A7.8. Willful Violations and Actions of Individuals. This paragraph applies if the actions
described in these examples are taken by Permittee authorized individuals or otherwise taken
deliberately by an individual working under permitted activities. The RICS will promptly report
all suspected deliberate violations of NRC requirements to NRC Region IV office. RIC
enforcement action may consist of requiring actions be taken directly toward the individual. The
RIC may address immediate and ongoing safety issues as well as initiate an investigation into
suspected deliberate violations unless directed otherwise by the NRC. In addition, the Permittee
or other personnel may report willful violations to AF investigative or legal agencies. Listed
below are examples of situations that could result in enforcement actions against individuals.
   A7.8.1. The situations include, but are not limited to, violations that involve:
       A7.8.1.1. Willfully causing a Permittee to be in violation of permit requirements;
       A7.8.1.2. Willfully taking action that would have caused a Permittee to be in violation of
       requirements but the consequence(s) of the action did not occur because it was detected
       and corrective action was taken;
       A7.8.1.3. Recognizing a violation of procedural requirements and willfully not taking
       corrective action.
       A7.8.1.4. Willfully defeating alarms and/or interlocks that have safety significance;
       A7.8.1.5. Dereliction of duty;
       A7.8.1.6. Falsifying records required by MML requirements or by the Permittee;
       A7.8.1.7. Willfully providing, or causing a Permittee to provide, an Inspection Agency
       inspector with inaccurate or incomplete information on a matter material to the radiation
       protection program; or
       A7.8.1.8. Willfully withholding safety significant information rather than making such
       information known and available to appropriate supervisory or technical personnel in the
       Permittee’s organization.
   A7.8.2. Factors in Deciding Enforcement Actions: In its determination of whether to issue
   requirements that actions be taken concerning an individual, the following factors will be
   considered:
       A7.8.2.1. The level of the individual within the organization;
       A7.8.2.2. The individual’s training and experience as well as knowledge of the potential
       consequences of the misconduct;
 98                                                         AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


      A7.8.2.3. The safety consequences of the misconduct;
      A7.8.2.4. The degree of supervision of the individual, i.e., how closely is the individual
      monitored or audited and the likelihood of detection;
      A7.8.2.5. The employer’s response, (e.g., disciplinary action taken);
      A7.8.2.6. The attitude of the offender (e.g., admission of misconduct, acceptance of
      responsibility);
      A7.8.2.7. The degree of management responsibility or culpability; and
      A7.8.2.8. Who identified the misconduct.
   A7.8.3. Types of Enforcement Actions: any proposed enforcement action against individuals
   must be issued by the RIC/S. The particular sanction to be used should be determined on a
   case-by-case basis. Notices of Violation and Orders are examples of enforcement actions
   that may be appropriate involving individuals. Orders involving individuals might include
   provisions that would:
      A7.8.3.1. Prohibit involvement in MML permitted activities for a specified period of
      time (normally the period of suspension would not exceed five (5) years) or indefinitely
      until certain conditions are satisfied (e.g., completing specified training or meeting
      certain qualifications); or
      A7.8.3.2. Require retraining, additional oversight or independent verification of
      activities performed by the person, if the person is to be involved in permitted activities.
   A7.8.4. Disciplinary Enforcement: adverse personnel actions and other disciplinary actions
   are the responsibility of the organization to which the individual to be disciplined belongs.
   Discretion may be exercised by either escalating or mitigating enforcement action to ensure
   that the proposed enforcement action reflects the Inspection Agency and the RICS concerns
   regarding the violation(s) at issue and that it conveys the appropriate message to the
   Permittee.
A7.9. Violations of Reporting Requirements or Submitting False Information.
   A7.9.1. Reporting: Permittees are expected to provide complete, accurate, and timely
   information and reports when required. (T-1) A Permittee will not usually be cited for a
   failure to report a condition or event unless the Permittee was actually aware of the condition
   or event that it failed to report. A Permittee will, on the other hand, usually be cited for a
   failure to report a condition or event if the Permittee knew of the information to be reported,
   but did not recognize the reporting requirements.
   A7.9.2. Inaccurate and Incomplete Information: a violation of MML requirements involving
   submittal of incomplete and/or inaccurate information can result in the full range of
   enforcement actions.
      A7.9.2.1. Identification of false information. The labeling of a communication failure as
      a material false statement will be made on a case-by-case basis and will be reserved for
      egregious violations. Violations involving inaccurate or incomplete information or the
      failure to provide significant information identified by a Permittee will be categorized
      based on:
AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                               99


        A7.9.2.1.1. The degree of knowledge that the communicator should have had,
        regarding the matter, in view of his or her position, training, and experience;
        A7.9.2.1.2. The opportunity and time available prior to the communication to assure
        the accuracy or completeness of the information;
        A7.9.2.1.3. The degree of intent or negligence, if any, involved;
        A7.9.2.1.4. The formality of the communication;
        A7.9.2.1.5. The importance of the information which was wrong or not provided;
        A7.9.2.1.6. The rationale of the explanation for not providing complete and accurate
        information;
        A7.9.2.1.7. Efforts taken to correct information that is later identified as false or
        incomplete; and/or
        A7.9.2.1.8. Failures to correct false or incomplete information.

                                         Attachment 8
                                 MANAGING ALLEGATIONS

A8.1. Introduction. All Permittee employees are required to be aware of NRC Form 3, Notice
to Employees, which must be posted for all employees to view, and their right to make an
allegation (10 CFR Part 19). (T-0) Allegations will be investigated and reported IAW NRC
Management Directive 8.8, Management of Allegations. It is the responsibility of employees to
immediately identify conditions contrary to this and to work within an organization’s resources
to obtain corrective action. (T-1) If such cannot be accomplished due to a threatening
environment, limitation of resources or unwillingness of management, an allegation can be made
at any level, anytime, among the following hierarchy:
   A8.1.1. Supervisors;
   A8.1.2. PRSOs or IRSOs;
   A8.1.3. Commanders;
   A8.1.4. Inspector General;
   A8.1.5. USAF Radioisotope Committee Secretariat;
   A8.1.6. USAF Radioisotope Committee;
   A8.1.7. US Nuclear Regulatory Commission: although it is customary, and encouraged, for
   employees to use their supervisory chain to seek expedient resolution of problems at the
   lowest level, this is not mandatory. Anonymous allegations can be made; however,
   resolution may be impacted by quality of information received.
A8.2. Reporting Allegations.
   A8.2.1. Allegations containing the following information can be processed most effectively.
       A8.2.1.1. Name, occupation and contact information of person making the allegation;
       A8.2.1.2. Date and description of issue;
       A8.2.1.3. Individuals involved and witnesses;
       A8.2.1.4. Outcome and Consequences;
       A8.2.1.5. Details of previous reports, including who received them.
       A8.2.1.6. Any corrective actions to date; and
       A8.2.1.7. Expectations.
A8.3. RICS Handling of Allegations.
   A8.3.1. In the event the RICS receives an allegation, the following measures will be taken:
       A8.3.1.1. If the allegation is against the RICS, it will be immediately referred to the
       appropriate NRC Regional Office for disposition and AF/SG3/5 shall be informed.
       A8.3.1.2. If the allegation is not against the RICS, the appropriate NRC Regional Office
       will be notified. A brief written report, provided by the individual making the allegation
       will be forwarded to AFMSA/SG3PB for review and determination of the main merits of
AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     101


       investigating the allegation. The allegation will then be presented to the Chief, RICS,
       and, if deemed necessary, an Allegation Review Board (ARB) will be formed to conduct
       an investigation. (MML)
   A8.3.2. The ARB will be comprised of the following representatives:
       A8.3.2.1. Chair, RIC (will serve as the Chair, ARB);
       A8.3.2.2. Chief, RICS (RIC member);
       A8.3.2.3. Member of the          affected   MAJCOM,       Senior    Health   Physicist    or
       Bioenvironmental Engineer;
       A8.3.2.4. AFIA/SGI (RIC member);
       A8.3.2.5. Officer within the affected unit; and
       A8.3.2.6. AFLOA/JAC (RIC member).
   A8.3.3. The ARB should document the allegation investigation in an inspection report. It is
   important that the inspection reports protect the identity of the individual(s) making the
   allegation(s) and not provide any information in the report that may reveal his/her identity.
   The inspection report should not contain any detailed information of the inspection that
   would correlate the inspection to an allegation. The inspection report findings should be
   included in the allegation file for the respective allegation case for final resolution by the
   RIC.
   A8.3.4. Once determined adequate by the RIC/JA, the ARB will provide a final allegation
   investigation report and recommended course(s) of action to the RIC. An allegation
   involving a health or safety issue will have a higher priority.
   A8.3.5. All suspected deliberate violations of NRC requirements involving immediate and
   ongoing safety issues will be reported to the appropriate NRC Regional Office for disposition
   by the RIC. Concurrently, an immediate investigation may be conducted by the supervisors;
   PRSOs or IRSOs; Commanders; Inspector General; RICS; RIC; or ARB, as appropriate.
A8.4. Protecting the Identity of Individuals Making Allegations. The name of the
individual(s) making the allegation(s) and other identifying information which could potentially
identify the individual(s) will not be used in discussions of allegations or documents released to
the Permittee or members of the public related to the allegation. The identity of the individual(s)
will be protected, and the Inspection Agency will not advise a Permittee that an inspection is
based on an allegation. Exceptions to this policy include:
   A8.4.1. The circumstance where the individual has no objection to the release of his/her
   identity and is documented in the allegation file;
   A8.4.2. Communications within and between the RIC, RIC Secretariat, the NRC, the AF
   Inspection Agency, and other parties that require knowledge of this identity to properly
   manage the allegation; or
   A8.4.3. The circumstance where such protection would impact worker health and safety.
A8.5. Maintenance of Allegation Files. The RICS maintains the official file of all information
pertaining to each allegation. It is important that the RICS and RIC members assure there is no
unauthorized reproduction of information related to an allegation. Copies of allegation files may
 102                                                           AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


be made following approval by the AFMSA/SG3P case representative. All copies made of an
allegation file must be returned to the file or destroyed. These files, if and when collected, must
be maintained in a manner that is consistent with DOD Directive (DODD) 5400.11, DOD
Privacy Program, and AFI 33-332, USAF Privacy and Civil Liberties Act Program. (Ref Privacy
Act of 1974)
A8.6. Allegation Information in Inspection Reports. The investigation into the allegation
should be documented in an inspection report. It is important that the inspection reports protect
the identity of the individual(s) making the allegation(s) and not provide any information in the
report that may reveal his/her identity. The inspection report should not contain any detailed
information of the inspection that would correlate the inspection to an allegation. The inspection
report findings should be included in the allegation file for the respective allegation case for final
resolution by the RIC.
A8.7. Resolution of Allegations. The RIC will review all allegations received. Once all of the
necessary information related to the allegation has been collected, the RIC will review the
allegation file to determine if any further actions are required before a final decision is made. If
any findings of an allegation investigation are in violation of the regulations, then the severity
level of the violation will determine the response by the RIC to the command as described in the
Enforcement Policy, Attachment 7.
A8.8. Allegation Close-Out Report. Once the final disposition of an allegation is approved by
the RIC, a formal response and close-out report of the RIC findings will be forwarded to the
individual(s) who made the allegation by the RICS. If the individual(s) does/do not agree with
the findings of the RIC, then the individual(s) may appeal the findings of the RIC with any
additional information necessary to support the appeal of the final allegation findings.
A8.9. Allegation to the NRC. Nothing in this attachment prevents an individual from making
an allegation directly to the NRC, particularly as it pertains to allegations levied against the
RICS. The AF IG can provide assistance.
AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  103


                                         Attachment 9
                      RADIOISOTOPE COMMITTEE (PROTOCOL)

A9.1. USAF Radioisotope Committee (RIC) Charter. The RIC is responsible for providing
regulatory oversight for the use of RAM by USAF organizations except weapons related
materials falling under Section 91(a) or 91(b) of the AEA. The RIC approves controls for
acquiring, receiving, storing, distributing, using, transferring, and disposing of RAM to ensure
compliance with the USAF Master Materials License, NRC policy and guidance, other
applicable regulatory requirements, and DOD and USAF directives and instructions.
A9.2. RIC Committee Members, Organization, and Responsibilities.
   A9.2.1. Chapter 2 of this AFI specifies the membership and general roles for each member
   of the RIC. At the request of the RICS or the RIC Chairman, additional advisors can be
   invited.
   A9.2.2. RIC Secretariat (RICS): Organization, scheduling and planning of the RIC meeting,
   and generation of meeting minutes.
   A9.2.3. RIC Chair: Open RIC meetings, and preside over their proceedings. Assist in
   maintaining the discussion focus of the agenda items, and resolve disagreements. Adjourn
   meeting once completed.
   A9.2.4. RIC Members: Ensure either they or their alternates attend scheduled RIC meetings
   and are prepared to address agenda items.
A9.3. Business Practices.
   A9.3.1. The RIC Chair and the RICS will establish the detailed procedures for RIC
   meetings. In all cases, the meetings will meet the requirements of the USAF MML and other
   USAF requirements for meetings of this type.
       A9.3.1.1. In accordance with MML requirements, a formal RIC meeting shall occur as
       represented to and agreed upon by the AF and NRC. RIC meetings are schedule by the
       RICS.
       A9.3.1.2. Ad hoc meetings can be called by the RIC Chair on an as needed basis. These
       meetings are called to address emergent issues that require timely action by the RIC.
       A9.3.1.3. Rapid staffing of an action can be approved by the RIC Chair to address
       emergent issues for which an ad hoc meeting cannot be convened. For a rapid staffing
       the RICS will prepare a staffing package that addresses the issue and provides the voting
       members of the RIC the ability to vote without meeting. All rapid staffing actions will be
       discussed at the next RIC meeting.
       A9.3.1.4. A quorum for a meeting is established by having a least one-half of the voting
       members present.
   A9.3.2. Meetings will be conducted IAW all applicable policies and procedures. The RIC
   Chair and the RICS will establish the specific procedures for the conduct of routine meetings,
   ad hoc meetings and rapid-staffing actions.
   A9.3.3. Motions and Voting.
 104                                                      AFI40-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


       A9.3.3.1. Only members and guests recognized by the Chair may speak.
       A9.3.3.2. Only voting members may vote on an issue.
       A9.3.3.3. Generally, before any item can be discussed, there should be a motion made
       and seconded. Once a motion has been seconded, discussion will follow. After
       discussion, one of four things can happen:
          A9.3.3.3.1. There can be a vote on the motion. In the event of a tie, the Chair casts
          the deciding vote; or
          A9.3.3.3.2. The motion can be amended (second required). Then there can be
          discussion on the amendment. The amendment can be voted. If the amendment
          passes, the motion automatically passes. If the amendment fails, the motion still
          stands and can be discussed until voted; or
          A9.3.3.3.3. The motion can be tabled (second required). There can be no discussion
          on a motion to table--a vote must be taken immediately. If the vote is to table, no
          further discussion can take place on the motion; or
          A9.3.3.3.4. There may be no action on the motion--therefore it becomes old business
          at a future meeting.
       A9.3.3.4. Motions must be clear and concise. A motion to "improve permitting
       practices" would be vague and discussions could meander. However, a motion to
       "implement template permit processes for a new chemical agent monitor" is specific and
       could be effectively discussed and acted on.
A9.4. Disagreement Resolution. The RIC Chair is responsible for maintaining order. On
procedural questions, the Chair's ruling will be final.
A9.5. Record Keeping.
   A9.5.1. The RICS will ensure that appropriate files for each meeting are maintained IAW all
   applicable requirements. This will include as a minimum, the agenda, meeting minutes, copy
   of all pertinent reference materials, background information, memoranda, standing reports,
   and presentations applicable to each meeting.
   A9.5.2. RICS will maintain correspondence, permit actions, NOVs or enforcement actions,
   and other applicable materials during the quarter to ensure a complete agenda. (MML)
   A9.5.3. Records of RIC meetings, to include agendas, presentations, and meeting minutes,
   shall be kept for the duration of existence of the MML.
