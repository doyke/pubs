clearance in JPAS and the unit security manager will grant the access in JPAS and related NDA
or attestation. The unit will keep the originals on file until the individual’s investigation
adjudicates.
3.21.1. (Added)Every month 341 MW/IP will send the PASS spreadsheet to each squadron with
members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP). The USM will update the spreadsheet by
adding PRP individuals with open/submitted PSIs and deleting PRP individuals whose PSIs have
adjudicated. Once the update is complete, the USM will return the unit’s PASS spreadsheet to
341 MW/IP, who will in turn forward the 341 MW PASS spreadsheet to AFSPC/IP.
*5.1.General.The Unit Security Manager (USM) will be responsible for all members assigned to
their unit requiring an initial or Periodic Reinvestigation (PR). It is the USM’s responsibility to
ensure unit personnel are notified when their PR is due. All PR requests will be submitted to 341
MW/IP for processing.
5.1.2. (Added)Specific procedures for initiating PSI requests are outlined in Attachment 27
(Added) of this supplement. Failure to follow the prescribed procedures will result in delay of
request processing, denial of access to classified information, and possible establishment of a
SIF.
5.1.3. (Added) USMs or alternates will initiate the Local Files Check on the AF Form 2583,
Request for Personnel Security Action. The AF 2583, signed by the USM and Mental Health,
must be received by the authorized requester within 30 days of the date annotated in Block 12 of
the AF Form 2583. The AF 2583 Remarks section must contain the individual’s last
Investigation Date, Unit Personnel Record Group (UPRG) check and Unfavorable Information
File (UIF) check, as applicable, with all derogatory information listed, job title, and verification
of United States citizenship. JPAS will not be used as a tool of verification of U.S. citizenship.
USM will verify by physically inspecting birth certificates, naturalization certificates, reports of
birth abroad, or citizenship certificates for all initial investigations for Secret and Top Secret
clearances. Specific AF 2583 processing procedures are outlined in Attachment 27 of this
supplement.
5.1.4. (DELETED)

*7.9.The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS).If JPAS reflects incomplete or
incorrect data, contact 341 MW/IP.
*7.9.1.1. (Added) USMs must utilize JPAS to grant and debrief Access for the individuals in

PRP.
*8.2.1.3.Unit commanders are given the option to establish a SIF when unfavorable information
is brought to their attention. USMs should advise commanders that a SIF is not punishment.
The decision to establish a SIF is made by considering the seriousness of the incident, the
individual’s motivation, whether the incident was out of character for the individual, and whether
the undesirable conduct or behavior is likely to continue. The commander may choose the 45-
day option to evaluate the individual’s actions for 45 days. If there is any doubt on whether to
establish a SIF, USMs should recommend the 45-day option to their commander.
*8.2.1.4.Once the commander/supervisor has administered any disciplinary action against an
individual relating to the circumstances surrounding the establishment of a SIF, the commander’s

required documents should be placed in the SIF. If there are any questions regarding which
items are required, refer to AFI 31-501, AFI 31-501 AFSPC Sup, and the 341 MW SIF Guide.

meeting at 341 MW/IP’s office with the individual, their supervisor, the commander, and the
USM. The USM should contact these individuals within 24 hours of initial notification.

investigation request. The individual will bring the following items to 341 MW/IP for
processing: A hard copy of their e-QIP Personnel Security Questionnaire, unsigned e-QIP
signature pages, and any other required documentation.

USM will initiate the AF Form 2583, Request for Personnel Security Action. USMs will not sign
the AF Form 2583 without first checking the individual’s UPRG and UIF for derogatory
information, if applicable. All derogatory information will be entered in Block 30, along with

she makes an appointment with 341 MW/IP. The individual takes the following items to 341

other required forms; i.e., OF 306, resume, et cetera.
AFI31-501_341MWSUP 13 APRIL 2009                                                                    7


A27.3. (Added)341 MW/IP will return the original AF Form 2583 to the unit, who must keep it
on file until the new investigation is adjudicated in JPAS.
A27.4. (Added)If the investigation request is for an initial Top Secret investigation, ensure the
individual provides full information for the previous 10 years. If the request is for a Secret
investigation, Secret reinvestigation, or a Top Secret reinvestigation, ensure the individual

will be submitted and all further actions (i.e., tracer actions and telephone inquiries) will be
completed by 341 MW/IP; however, security managers must monitor their unit JPAS rosters to
determine when the investigation has been adjudicated.
