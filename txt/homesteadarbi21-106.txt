SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Interim Change 1 incorporates minor changes as well as adding work center and tenant
organization responsibilities . A (|) indicates a change from the previous edition of HARBI 21-
106.
1. Generalized Crashed,       Damaged,      or   Disabled    Aircraft   Recovery     (CDDAR)
Responsibilities.

     1.1. Supervisors at all levels must recognize the sources of hazards and apply appropriate
     safety practices to minimize their effect. There is an infinite variety of possible emergency
     and crash recovery situations; therefore, specific procedures cannot be prescribed for every
     situation. All aircraft recovery actions are coordinated through the Emergency Operations
     Center (EOC) and/or the Incident Commander (IC). All operations at the incident location
     will be under the purview of the IC. If incident location is not DoD-owned land the IC may
     be a civilian from the owning jurisdiction. Regardless of organizational affiliation, IAW the
     National Incident Management System, the IC will retain all tactical decision making on
     scene.
2. Responsibilities of Each Base Organization for CDDAR Responses.
     2.1. The 482 FW/CC is the installation commander and is responsible for all response
     elements during incident/contingency operations. As the situation shifts away from response
     to clean-up or investigation, overall command may transfer to other units as appropriate.
     2.2. Transient Alert will respond to aircraft emergencies IAW the Base Operations and
     Support Services (BOS) Statement of Work (SOW).
     2.3. Local authorities are responsible for responding to off installation crash/disabled
     aircraft. If assistance is required, they will coordinate with 482 FW/Command Post (482
     FW/CP) for assistance.
     2.4. 482 FW/CP is responsible for initiating 482 FW Checklist 1B Aircraft Mishap/Incident/
     Crash, which includes contacting all pertinent base agencies and Wing leadership. 482d
     Maintenance Group/CC (482 MXG/CC) and/or 482d Maintenance Squadron/CC (482
     MXS/CC) will direct the Crash Recovery Team (CRT) to assemble on standby or respond as
     requested by the IC.
     2.5. 482d Maintenance Squadron (482 MXS).
        2.5.1. 482 MXS/Maintenance Flight (482 MXS/MXMTC) is responsible for the 482 FW
        deployable crash recovery program and assisting base agencies with local crash/disabled
        aircraft responses occurring on or off HARB.
        2.5.2. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) Flight will provide necessary ground
        equipment such as but not limited to; Lightcart, -60, Bomblift, MC-2A LOPAC, MC-7,
        Heater, Disabled Wheel Dolly or Maintenance Stands at the request of the IC and/or
        CRT. All equipment must be readily available for use during CDDAR operations.
        2.5.3. Munitions Flight will provide a driver and munitions trailers as needed for
        removal of munitions/explosives.
        2.5.4. Fuel Shop will dispatch hydrazine response personnel, team, or trailer if requested.
        2.5.5. Egress will respond and remove explosives if requested and accessible.
     2.6. 482d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (482 AMXS).
     2.7. 482 MXS will dispatch hydrazine response personnel, team, or trailer if requested.
     2.8. 482d Maintenance Group/Quality Assurance (482 MXG/MXQ) Weight and Balance
     Manager, when requested by the CRTC, will help determine weight and Center of Gravity
     (CG) conditions of aircraft.
