1. General
     1.1. Objectives. The 509 BW Exercise and Evaluation Program (EEP) has two primary
     objectives:
        1.1.1. Improve combat capability, enhance readiness, improve crisis response, streamline
        procedures, identify critical cyber and physical infrastructure and their potential
        vulnerabilities and help master OPLAN taskings.
        1.1.2. Provide realistic, integrated, large-scale training for the installation and its
        response personnel, determining the capability to perform combatant and noncombatant
        contingency operations and respond to homeland security threats.
     1.2. Goal. Capitalize on the lessons learned and feedback gained through exercises and
     evaluations to meet wing objectives.
     1.3. Evaluation Conduct. Conduct evaluations according to written criteria, scenario
     guidelines and evaluation checklists.
        1.3.1. During each exercise, EET members will guide exercise events through inputs via
        inject cards (Attachment 2), messages, or verbal directions.
        1.3.2. EET members have discretionary power in the management of their assigned
        events and will provide on-the-spot corrective action as necessary to ensure safety,
        training, and proper flow of the scenario. To the maximum extent possible, EET
        members should not interfere unless intervention is required for safety, overall exercise
        scenario or in their judgment on the spot intervention and training is absolutely required.
        Scenario flow should not be disrupted. EET members will provide immediate feedback,
        good and bad, for all observed performance after task completion.
        1.3.3. Evaluators will not deviate from the Master Sequence of Events List (MSEL)
        (Attachment 3), timeline or script without prior approval from the EET Chief. Timing is
        critical in the flow and control of an exercise scenario. EET members must work as a
        team by communicating and coordinating actions that affect the scenario flow in order to
        conduct a well-orchestrated exercise. Evaluators may offer on-the-spot injects to keep
WHITEMANAFBI10-211 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                             3


     the exercise on track if it becomes apparent that the exercise players are deviating from
     the scenario and its objectives.
     1.3.4. Evaluations will be based upon observations of demonstrated performance, using
     available resources, under realistic time constraints and near-actual conditions.
     Evaluations should be based on published guidance (AFI‘s, T.O.‘s, etc.) to the max extent
     possible and not techniques. This does not prevent offering up recommendation for an
     improved process as feedback.
     1.3.5. Some observations will clearly comply/not comply; others may be judgment calls
     requiring further validation. In either case, everything observed will be thoroughly
     documented in as much detail as possible.                Evaluators will note names,
     organization/agency, location, time, action directed/taken and the impact or result. EET
     members may make observations about any person, agency or area participating in the
     exercise. All observations not related to a member‘s area of expertise will be properly
     validated with the responsible EET member prior to input to 509 BW/XP.
     1.3.6. During evaluations, participants will maximize the realism of each exercise.
     Wherever possible, participants will take each scenario to its logical conclusion,
     exercising each branch of possible actions.
  1.4. Concept. Embody the ―train the way we fight‖ concept. Plan exercises to reflect the
  real world. Emphasize participation (minimize simulations) and reduce artificialities
  (notional forces and events) to assess actual abilities and limits consistent with safety,
  exercise objectives, security, mission accomplishment and other real-world constraints.
  Make sure logistics, support and force protection requirements are fully integrated with
  operational requirements.
  1.5. Conditions. To the extent possible, exercises should be designed, conducted and
  evaluated under ―no-fault‖ conditions in order to gain confidence and to ensure problems are
  identified. (Assigning office primary responsibility (OPRs) in reports to correct deficiencies
  does not imply fault). Give participants the ―opportunity to fail/learn‖ while ensuring safety.
  1.6. Real-World Incidents. To receive credit for real-world incidents, criteria in AFI 10-
  2501, must be met and the incident documented.
  1.7. Support Requirements. Vehicle requirements will be identified in first ERT or EET
  meeting for exercises and support request letter will be sent to 509th Logistics Readiness
  Squadron Vehicle Ops.
  1.8. EET Member Criteria. It is highly recommended that commanders select TSgt and
  above and Captain and above to serve as EET members. All evaluators must have at least
  two-year retainability. It is recommended individual(s) have a broad knowledge base in
  areas outside their own functional area to adequately measure functional areas within the unit
  who do not have an EET evaluator. Evaluators will not be part of a group that will present a
  conflict of interest i.e. disaster control group, Crisis Action Team, Emergency Operation
  Center (EOC), Readiness Support Team, etc.
  1.9. Removal from EET. The EET Chief can remove individual(s) at any time from the
  EET for the following reasons:
 4                                              WHITEMANAFBI10-211 2 FEBRUARY 2012


        1.9.1. Failure to demonstrate good judgment, expertise and knowledge and a willingness
        to participate.
        1.9.2. Failure to present proper military image.
        1.9.3. Failure to comply with EET responsibilities.
     1.10. Exercise Participation. 509 BW unit commanders and associate units will maximize
     their participation in each applicable wing exercise and minimize simulations. They will
     work with 509 BW/XP and their respective EET member(s) to ensure the unit‘s training and
     exercise requirements are integrated into the long-range plan and each applicable exercise.
     1.11. Trusted Agent. Certain 509 BW personnel may receive ―Trusted Agent‖ information
     relating to 509 BW and Higher Headquarter (HHQ) exercises and evaluations. This
     information will not be provided to anyone who is not an EET member, to include
     supervisors or commanders. Scheduling and planning wing exercises is extremely time
     consuming; compromise of this information will result in wasted manpower and resources.
     Members found compromising ―Trusted Agent‖ information will be brought to the attention
     of their commander. Trusted agents do not require EET training.
     1.12. Documentation. Documentation containing exercise timing and information carried
     by evaluators during exercises is also ―Trusted Agent‖ information and is not to be provided
     to commanders or supervisors. After final reports are distributed, any/all information may be
     released.

        2.1.5. Obtain the 509th Bomb Wing Commander‘s (509 BW/CC) approval (and
        coordinates with affected group commanders) before establishing or conducting
        exercises.
        2.1.6. Coordinate with appropriate on-base and off-base agencies prior to conducting
        exercises. Note: Off-base exercises require sufficient advance notice to the appropriate
        agencies. Forward advance notifications of off-base exercises to 509th Bomb Wing
        Public Affairs (509 BW/PA), 509th Bomb Wing Staff Judge Advocate (509 BW/JA), HQ
        AFGSC/A7 and all on- and off-base officials maintaining appropriate memorandums of

3. Training Requirements
     3.1. Prerequisite Training. Current CBRNE Defense Course is a prerequisite prior to
     attending initial EET training.
     3.2. General. Individuals must attend 509 BW/XP initial EET training prior to evaluating
     assigned areas. Previous training from other installations will not qualify as credit.
        3.2.1. If an individual must be assigned short notice to replace an existing EET member
        and has not had initial EET training, the individual must receive training within 60 days
        of assignment. In the interim, the functional area EET lead will brief the individual on
        what is expected of him/her to fulfill the EET duties until trained by 509 BW/XP. Notify
        the EET team chief immediately of the change.
     3.3. Initial EET Training. Initial EET training will be held as required. This training
     consists of the EET computer based training (CBT), the Aero Command and Control CBT,
     (both CBT‘s are located on ADLS) and a classroom training session. 509 BW/XP will notify
     squadron commanders and EET via email message when and where the training will be

   4.3. EET Requirements Per Exercise. Refer to Attachment 6 for the minimum number of
   EET members needed per specific exercise. These are the minimum requirements and may
   vary depending on the scenario.
5. Pre-Trans and Post-Exercise Actions
   5.1. EET Meetings. Prior to each exercise, 509 BW/XP will conduct several meetings.
   Lead EET evaluators from each functional area or squadron EET POC must attend. They are
   responsible for coordinating evaluation areas and briefing their EET partners. The following
   will be discussed:
      5.1.1. Exercise Objectives.
      5.1.2. Scenarios and injects.
      5.1.3. Master Sequence of Events List (MSEL) development.
      5.1.4. Coordination.
      5.1.5. EET member role.
      5.1.6. EET members are the key to a successful exercise scenario. Each member must
      know their commander‘s intent in terms of what extent they want to participate in each
      exercise and the specific objectives they want to achieve. With this knowledge the EET
      member(s), working in unison with other EET members from different functional areas,
      are the sole source for scenario and MSEL development. 509 BW/XP‘s role is to
      facilitate EET in scenario and MSEL development thus relying on the experts in each
      area to provide the inputs needed to make a chronologically and logically planned
      exercise. Note: Not all EET will be required for each type of exercise. Depending on
      the exercise objectives and time constraints, only certain aspects of the overall exercise
      may be evaluated. It is up to the unit EET and squadron commander to arrange if
12                                           WHITEMANAFBI10-211 2 FEBRUARY 2012


     additional areas will be evaluated for in-house purposes. These observations may not be
     included in the final report if they are not part of the objectives or graded areas.
  5.2. Evaluation. During each exercise the participating EET member(s) are expected to
  observe and record the unit‘s processes, products and capabilities and record those actions,
  positive or negative. Note: Maintenance Group evaluators (Quality Assurance and Weapons
  Standardization Section) will meet prior to each exercise to coordinate activities to detail
  who will evaluate what in the maintenance area. This prevents duplicate inspections and
  eliminates conflicting data in the report.
     5.2.1. Evaluations will be in accordance with any one of or a combination of the
     following criteria: Exercise objectives, applicable governing instructions or directives,
     OPLANS, or AFI 90-201 and AFI 90-201_AFGSCSUP and associated addendums
     grading criteria.
     5.2.2. EET members should strive to conduct stringent in-depth evaluations to ensure an
     adequate assessment of their respective unit‘s processes, products, and capabilities.
     5.2.3. EET members should review past reports from Whiteman and other AF units to
     determine key evaluation areas for each exercise (reports can be accessed on the 509
     BW/XP SharePoint site or the HQ AFGSC/IG web page). Review ―Recommended
     Improvement Areas‖ and ―Findings‖ (as well as ―Strengths‖) as they may indicate an
     area that your unit is deficient in.
     5.2.4. It is recommended to review and use the HAF checklist when able and to develop
     additional checklists if necessary for each type of exercise. This will ensure complete
     and consistent evaluations.
  5.3. Reports. At the beginning of each exercise, a draft report will be posted on the
  509 BW/XP SharePoint site under the EET tab. It is highly recommended to enter
  observations daily to ensure something is not forgotten and more importantly to preclude late
  submission to 509 BW/XP. Inputs must be completed NLT the deadline set by the EET team
  chief. Missed deadlines adversely affect the hotwash, out brief and final report. It is 509
  BW/XP‘s goal to make the report final within 1 week after an exercise. EET is the key to a
  readable, understandable and properly formatted final report.
     5.3.1. The report will be pre-filled in with the exercise objectives or graded areas.
     5.3.2. Using the validated exercise evaluation form as a reference, enter the observations
     in the applicable area of the draft report. Note: Reference past reports as a guide for
     making entries.
         5.3.2.1. Inputs will be bullet format and must be clear, concise, and understandable to
         someone outside your expertise. Do not make extensively long entries; summarize
         observations with enough detail to convey the meaning.
         5.3.2.2. Observations will be one of the three following categories:            Strength,
         Recommended Improvement Area, or Finding.
             5.3.2.2.1. Strength – process, product, or capability which is exemplary.
             5.3.2.2.2. Recommended Improvement Area – process, product, or capability
             which could be improved.
WHITEMANAFBI10-211 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                                            13


              5.3.2.2.3. Finding – core problem or significant deficiencies. Note: Findings
              entries will be preceded by FINDING in bold, capitalized letters. The narrative
              entry will also be bolded but not capitalized. Include the OPR and reference after
              the entry.
      5.3.3. Some reports may include an additional area called ‗Additional Observations‘ that
      will be used to enter observations that do not fit into the overall objectives or graded
      areas but are important enough to be mentioned in the report.
      5.3.4. Consolidate like or similar observations.
      5.3.5. After all entries are made, the completed report will be emailed back to 509
      BW/XP.
   5.4. Hotwash. Following an exercise, 509 BW/XP will conduct an EET hotwash to discuss
   the issues pertaining to the exercise.           At this time evaluators will validate
   findings/observations and discuss the exercise in its entirety. This is the forum for the EET
   to scrub the evaluation process and improve capability.
   5.5. Post Exercise. Following each exercise unit EET members should continue to follow-
   up and monitor progress of ‖Findings‖ until the unit has satisfactorily resolved or closed the
   issue.
6. Badges
   6.1. EET Badges. EET badges are issued and controlled by 509 BW/XP. They will be
   changed at least annually to ensure authenticity.
      6.1.1. Badges will be issued to EET team members upon proper appointment from their
      commander and completion of all training requirements.
      6.1.2. EET members will not give badges to anyone else.
      6.1.3. EET badges are an accountable item and tracked by badge number.
      6.1.4. Badges will be worn when performing EET duties. Display badge above the waist
      on the front of the uniform where it can be easily seen.
      6.1.5. When members perform EET duties on the flightline, badge will be secured with
      lanyard or other approved methods as per governing directives.
      6.1.6. EET badges do not replace or supplement USAF Restricted Area Badges. EET
      members are only cleared into restricted areas identified/permitted on their personal
      USAF Restricted Area Badge unless properly pre-announced and/or escorted.
   6.2. Lost Badges. If a badge is lost, notify 509 BW/XP immediately for deletion of lost
   badge number and issue of a new badge.
      6.2.1. If the badge is lost on the flightline, immediately contact production
      superintendent and quality assurance.
   6.3. Exercise Observer Badges. The same rules apply to exercise observer badges as with
   EET badges, although they do not give the authority to evaluate. Observer badges are
   controlled and issued by 509 BW/XP.
