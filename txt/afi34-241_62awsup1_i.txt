1. Meal Card Procedures.
   1.1. Who Receives DD Form 714, Meal Card.
       1.1.1. Anyone who is authorized to get Subsistence-In-Kind (SIK) in appropriated fund dining
       facilities must use DD Form 714 for identification, unless the dining facility has SIMS.
       1.1.2. Personnel of other Services stationed or attached to Air Force installations and authorized
       for SIK.
       1.1.3. Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps cadets with paid training status who are autho-
       rized for SIK. In these cases the meal card can serve as identification.
2                                                 AFI34-241_62AWSUP1_INT 13 DECEMBER 2001


    1.2. Issuing and Reissuing Meal Cards.
       1.2.1. Issue meal cards as soon as practical after their arrival, but not later than 3 duty days to SIK
       members.
       1.2.2. Issue meal cards in numerical sequence. The unit administration controls the meal cards
       unless the major command (MAJCOM) approves some other central office.
       1.2.3. The installation commander sets a schedule for the recall and reissue of meal cards to main-
       tain proper control.
    1.3. Forms To Use.
       1.3.1. Use AF Form 25l, Meal Card Control Register.
           • To keep accurate and current records of meal cards issued, turned in, reissued, reported
              lost, destroyed, or written off.
           • To record the names of persons who receive meal cards.
           • To show dates for stamped orders when they are authorized in place of the meal card.
       1.3.2. Use AF Form 1665, Issue and Control of Meal Cards Inspection, in single copy as an
       inspection checklist to control meal cards. This form keeps track of meal cards from the time of
       request until they are received, stored, issued, destroyed, or written off.
       1.3.3. Units assigned or attached to an installation receiving food service support must complete
       two copies of AF Form 3002, Subsistence Strength Report. Retain one copy in the unit and send
       a copy to food service. When required by the MAJCOM, food service may compile the data for
       AF Form 3002 using SIK information and the present-for-duty figures from the base personnel.
    1.4. For Personnel Not Authorized Meal Cards.
       1.4.1. Members living in temporary quarters and authorized Temporary Lodging Allowance
       (TLA) or Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) are entitled to the Basic Allowance for Subsistence
       (BAS). Do not issue a meal card to these members. Anyone using a meal card while receiving
       BAS, including those on leave and on temporary duty (TDY), can be criminally charged for using
       the dining facility and may be subject to disciplinary action.
       1.4.2. Do not issue meal cards for Permanent Change of Station (PCS) arrivals on temporary
       assignments of less than 30 days. For these individuals:
           • The administrative clerk at the temporary unit clearly stamps the temporary unit designa-
              tion on a copy of the PCS orders.
           • If SIK status is authorized, the clerk enters the SIK authorization and expiration dates.
              The order serves as temporary identification and authority for SIK in the dining facility.
           • If the clerk does not use AF Form 251, for this purpose, maintain a separate list to show
              when the stamped orders are issued and returned.

2. Services Information Management System (SIMS).
    2.1. Installations with SIMS identify SIK personnel using the Armed Forces Identification Card and
    the social security number (SSN) rather than a meal card.
AFI34-241_62AWSUP1_INT 13 DECEMBER 2001                                                                 3


   2.2. Each unit provides food service with an initial listing of all personnel authorized SIK. After
   loading the list into SIMS, unit commanders recall and destroy all meal cards. Note this destruction
   on current AF Form 251.
   2.3. Each month, food service provides two copies of a computer printout to each unit, listing all per-
   sonnel who are authorized SIK. The unit commander, or designated representative, verifies the roster
   and returns a signed copy to the food service staff office within 5 work days. The food service officer
   consolidates and updates the SIMS records. The unit retains one copy for their records to annotate
   changes as they occur and to validate the next month's listing.
   2.4. Food service maintains AF Form 1469, Subsistence-In-Kind Invalid Entitlements Log, for
   personnel who are entitled to SIK but are not properly loaded in the SIK data base. See instructions
   on the reverse side of the form.

3. For Bases Without Services Information Management System (SIMS) .
   3.1. The Support Group commander publishes an installation instruction for validating SIK entitle-
   ment and identification. Through this instruction, the Support Group commander:
      3.1.1. Assigns a representative from outside the food service to inspect each unit that issues meal
      cards on an annual basis. This representative must use AF Form 1665 as a checklist during this
      annual unit meal-card inspection.
      3.1.2. Outlines procedures for personnel who are changing ration status, leaving PCS, separating,
      or for any other reason are no longer authorized for SIK. Members departing on nonduty hours
      must turn in meal cards during duty hours. These individuals can use a copy of their orders instead
      of a meal card to receive meals. Stamp the orders with a temporary SIK authorization, and write
      in a meal card number and the date the card expires (rarely more than 2 or 3 days).
      3.1.3. Establishes procedures for control and safeguarding unissued and returned meal cards.
      3.1.4. Requires that the administrative clerk issue meal cards in numerical sequence and account
      for them by serial number.
      3.1.5. Directs personnel to record the destruction of unissued meal cards on AF Form 145, Certif-
      icate of Destruction of Material.
      3.1.6. Ensures that meal cards have the base name overprinted, typed, or stamped in bold letters
      on them and are overstamped with the name or number of the dining facility if a member may use
      only one of two or more facilities.
      3.1.7. Prevents unauthorized use of meal cards from other installations.
      3.1.8. Allows visiting SIK members, not on leave or TDY status, to eat at no charge in enlisted
      dining facilities.
      3.1.9. Requires the meal card monitor or inspector to use the formula on the back of AF Form
      1665 to calculate the number of outstanding meal cards.
      3.1.10. Outlines procedures for reporting discrepancies and what corrective action was taken.
   3.2. The Unit Commander appoints by letter a unit meal card control officer or noncommissioned
   officer (NCO) who controls and certifies the destruction of meal cards.
      3.2.1. The unit meal-card control officer or NCO:
4                                                AFI34-241_62AWSUP1_INT 13 DECEMBER 2001


           3.2.1.1. Ensures that the person responsible for issuing DD Form 714, draws a line through
           the wording on the back of the meal card "When individual is in a TDY or leave status.”
           3.2.1.2. Accounts for lost meal cards and immediately notifies the food service officer in writ-
           ing of any loss.
           3.2.1.3. Promptly completes a new line entry on AF Form 251 for a card that is reported lost.
           Enters the date reported if it is different from the one shown in column E, and write the word
           "LOST" in column F. Deducts one card from the total number of meal cards outstanding to
           date (column H). Issues a new meal card and makes a new line entry to report it, adding one
           card to the total outstanding (column H).
           3.2.1.4. Destroys recovered cards immediately and notes the action by certifying and initial-
           ing a line entry in column G on the date that the loss was reported. Delays destruction only
           where clearly justified by circumstances. Makes a note of reasons and keep for future refer-
           ence.
           3.2.1.5. Writes off meal cards that are lost for more than 30 days.
           3.2.1.6. Develops controls for prompt withdrawal, immediate destruction (if required) for
           meal cards, and when an individual is no longer authorized to have a meal card. This does not
           apply during leave or TDY when individuals keep their meal cards.
           3.2.1.7. Destroys damaged meal cards that have unreadable numbers or personnel data.

4. For Bases With the Services Information Management System (SIMS).
    4.1. The Unit Commander appoints a control officer or NCO by letter to monitor the ration status of
    each BAS or SIK member. The control officer or NCO:
       4.1.1. Submits a copy of AF Form 1373, MPO Document Control Log Transmittal, or a letter
       with the same information, to the food service staff office. This is done the same date that the AF
       Form 220, Request Authorization and Pay Order Basic Allowance of Subsistence (BAS), is
       sent to Accounting and Finance. The remarks column of AF Form 1373 should indicate whether
       the action starts or stops BAS so food service can update the master SIK listing. Do not use AF
       Forms 1373 for BAS personnel who should not be routed to food service.
       4.1.1. (62AW) The original AF Form 220, Request Authorization and Pay Order Basic Allow-
       ance of Subsistence (BAS), must be either hand-carried or sent through distribution to 62 SVS/
       SVMF. Food service staff verifies the effective date on the form and either adds or deletes person-
       nel from the master file. Food service personnel must initial the top right corner of the AF Form
       220 and maintain one copy prior to forwarding two copies to Accounting and Finance. Finance
       will not process an AF Form 220 without initials from the food service staff office (62 SVS/
       SVMF). A McChord Form 552, Subsistence in Kind (SIK) Authorization, is not required when
       an AF Form 220 is accomplished.
       4.1.2. Hand-carries documents to the food service office for coordination when it is practical to
       do so.
       4.1.2. (62AW) Refer to 4.1.1., 4.1.4., and 4.1.5.
       4.1.3. Advises SIK personnel that they must make prior arrangements before using their SSN in
       another installation's dining facility.
AFI34-241_62AWSUP1_INT 13 DECEMBER 2001                                                                  5


       4.1.4. Prepares letters for newly assigned personnel indicating the rank, name, and SSN of each
       member placed on SIK. Do not include personnel receiving TLA or TLE until these allowances
       run out. Submits letters to the food service staff office within 3 workdays of assignment. Food
       service enters the information in the master file.
       4.1.4. (62AW) Completes McChord Form 552 in lieu of a letter. McChord Forms 552 may be
       faxed to the food service staff office to enable personnel to be added to the master file immedi-
       ately.
       4.1.5. Ensures that personnel separating or going PCS from the installation report to the food ser-
       vice staff office for deletion from the master file. Personnel should report no earlier than 1 work-
       day prior to final out processing, or date entering TLA or TLE status. If individuals cannot report
       personally to the food service office, notify that office immediately of any change to the SIK ros-
       ter.
       4.1.5. (62AW) Ensures that a completed McChord Form 552 is submitted for personnel separat-
       ing or going PCS from the installation to the food service staff office for deletion from the master
       file. Effective dates of the McChord Forms 552 should be no earlier than one workday prior to
       final out-processing or date entering TLA or TLE status. If individuals cannot report personally to
       the food service office, a McChord Form 552 may be faxed or sent through distribution to 62 SVS/
       SVMF.
       4.1.6. Verifies the master SIK listing received from food service in conjunction with the annual
       BAS validation. Complete the inspection checklist attached to the SIK listing and return a copy to
       the food service staff office.
