This instruction checklist implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-285, Inspector
General--The Inspection System and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 90-201 Inspector General
Activities. This instruction checklist will be used to evaluate unit compliance with public law,
executive orders, Department of Defense and Air Force Directives. This instruction checklist
applies to all active Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA)
units. It also applies to AFISRA-gained Air National Guard (ANG) when published in ANG
Index (ANGIND) 2. It does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units or
members. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of
command. Maintain records created as a result of the prescribed processes identified in this
directory in accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and dispose of
them IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) found on the Air Force Portal link at

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

There are numerous grammatical and punctuation changes within this revision. Additions to this
document include item 1.7 under Facility Management, FOA and DRU in References column for
 2                                                               AFISRACL90-232 13 JULY 2011


item 2.4, and items 10.4 and 10.5 under Emergency Management. Finally, corrected numbering
errors under section CCO-5 and updated/replaced obsolete references throughout.
1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the
inspection/assessment. As a minimum, units should use these directories in conjunction with the
annual Unit Self-Assessment. The objective is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment
of required capabilities. Units can supplement this publication to add internal compliance items.
This instruction checklist may be used in whole or in part by HHQ during visits or exercises.
Users may add any item(s), which, in the exercise of good judgment, requires examination. For
the purpose of this document, unit may be used to indicate Squadron, Group, Wing, or Center.
      1.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). Items defined by the AFISRA Staff as key
      results areas for a successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to, items
      where non-compliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, or litigation.
      (The CCOs will be shown in BOLD and ALL CAPS format.) The following CCOs do not
      apply at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC): CCO-2, CCO-3, CCO-5,
      CCO-6, CCO-7, CCO-11 and CCO-14.
      1.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An area that requires special vigilance and is important
      to the overall performance of the unit, but is not deemed “critical.” Non-compliance would
      result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result in injury, unnecessary
      cost, or possible litigation. (The CCIs will be shown in ALL CAPS format.)
      1.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An area deemed fundamental to successful overall
      performance of the unit, but where non-compliance would result in minimal impact on
      mission accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury, increased cost, or possible
      litigation. (The GCIs will be shown in sentence case formal.)
