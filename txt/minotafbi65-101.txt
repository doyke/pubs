This instruction implements AFPD 65-1, Management of Financial Resources and Services. It prescribes
the policies and procedures to be used in granting reimbursement for vicinity travel in privately owned
vehicles for the conduct of official business on and around Minot AFB. It applies to all assigned units at
Minot AFB.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
Changes and updates organization titles and defines local area (paragraph 3.).


1. Policy: To the greatest extent possible, use government vehicles for vicinity travel. Reimbursement for
use of privately owned vehicles (POV) is only made when government vehicles are not available and the
use of POVs is more advantageous to the government.

2. Procedures
   2.1. When transportation is needed, the traveler notifies Vehicle Operations Branch, Dispatch Opera-
   tions Section for required transportation. If the request is for a period of 72 hours or more, it must be
   in writing. If a vehicle is not available and a POV is used, the traveler must keep an accurate log of the
   odometer reading for beginning and ending mileage of each trip.
   2.2. Dispatch Operations Section retains all requests for transportation received but not honored due
   to a lack of transportation and furnishes travelers with statements of nonavailability.
   2.3. Not less than once a month, travelers who use POVs in performance of official duty will file a
   claim with the Finance Office, Travel Pay Section, for reimbursement of mileage using a Standard
   Form 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business. Claims are approved by
   designated orders issuing or approving authorities only when a nonavailability slip is issued by Vehi-
   cle Operations Branch and the claim is supported by some form of mileage log.
   2.4. Finance honors the claim when it is approved and is filed with the nonavailability slip. Reim-
   bursement is at the rate prescribed in the Joint Federal Travel Regulation, Volume I. See the Joint Fed-
2                                                                 MINOTAFBI65-101 01 MAY 1996


    eral Travel Regulation, Volume II, for travel restrictions and further guidance concerning civilian
    employees.

3. Boundaries
    3.1. The following towns are the boundaries for vicinity travel at Minot AFB:
    East: To Granville, ND
    West: To Burlington, ND
    North: To Mohall, ND
    South: To Max, ND


    3.2. When normal or regular duty is performed outside of the defined vicinity, then the place of duty
