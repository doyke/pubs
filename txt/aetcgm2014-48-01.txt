                       MILITARY TRAINING CONSULT SERVICE

       This instruction describes newly established medical processes in support of USAF Basic
Military Training (BMT) operations, specifically the Military Training Consult Service (MTCS).

1. Objective: MTCS is a four-member team of psychologists and mental health technicians
assigned to the 59th Medical Wing, 559th Medical Group, 559th Aeromedical Squadron and
embedded into the 37th Training Wing, 737th Training Group, BMT to provide command
consultation, assist in Military Training Instructor (MTI) selection and training, and
psychological resiliency support to instructors for safe, effective performance throughout the
special duty assignment.

2. Responsibilities:

   a. The 37th Training Wing will ensure sufficient resources for MTCS operations.

   b. The 37th Training Wing will assure compliance with this guidance memorandum.

3. MTCS:

   a. MTI Selection:

      1) MTCS will develop and monitor the MTI Psychological Screening Protocol for
         effective use and potential improvements, and will provide updates and training to Air
         Force Medical Services (AFMS) providers in the use of the protocol.

      2) MTCS will administer the Multi-Dimensional 360 Assessment (MD360) to candidates
         being considered for MTI duty.

      3) MTCS will receive and review results of the psychological screening interview and
         provider assessment, will integrate results from the MD360, and will make
         recommendation on psychological fitness/suitability and safety risk to the 737 TRG.
         Protected Health Information will be disclosed in accordance with DoD 6025.18-R,
         DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation.

      4) MTCS will continually monitor and statistically analyze the effectiveness of
         instruments for ongoing validation and improvement.

   b. Command Consultation: MTCS will serve as consultants to Group, Squadron, and Flight
      leadership regarding psychological/behavioral issues that may impact individual, group, or
      unit safety and mission performance. This may include conducting focused
      attitude/climate assessment of units, groups, or individuals regarding performance and
      resiliency issues. MTCS may also conduct program evaluation analyses as requested by
      command, as well as review and interpret survey and other data for trend information for
      the command.
c. Instructor Consultation Services: MTCS will provide or arrange for a continuum of
   service options for assistance, including educational trainings and consultation to
   individuals, groups, and family members of MTIs in topics relevant to MTI duty
   performance, resiliency, work-life balance, and relationships. These prevention/education
   efforts are not associated with medical/mental health documentation of any kind. MTIs,
   staff, or family members who may need or desire mental health, medical, or other services
   will be educated regarding resources available in the area.

d. MTI Special Duty Annual Resiliency Consultation:

  1) All MTIs will receive an Annual Resiliency Consultation (ARC) in support of safe and
     effective functioning and resilience through MTI special duty. Timing at 12, 24, and 36
     months is intended to coincide with early in-duty performance following training, at
     approximate mid-tour, and prior to completion of the assignment.

  2) ARC is comprised of an individual preventative mental health screening with MTCS
     staff regarding psychological and behavioral health and risk factors relevant to safe and
     effective performance in MTI special duty. Education and appropriate referrals will be
     provided to the MTI if needed or desired. A brief notation of this consultation during
     MTI special duty status will be made in the electronic medical record. Individual
     information discussed will be confidential except as mandated by law or regulation.

  3) If determination is made that an MTIâ€™s current stressors or risk factors interfere
     significantly with the mission of safe and effective training, in an emergency, or
     otherwise mandated by law or regulation (e.g. suspected family maltreatment),
     recommendations will be made to the MTI and to his/her commander regarding
     potential risks to duty performance/safety, as well as options for care. Documentation
     will be made in the electronic medical record to support care and return to duty as
     appropriate.

  4) Aggregate data from ARCs may be used to monitor and advise leadership regarding
     trends, issues/challenges of MTI duty, as well as make organizational recommendations
     to improve the overall wellbeing, resilience, and performance of MTIs.
