This instruction implements AFPD 44-1, Medical Operations. This instruction establishes the
8th Fighter Wing’s Public Access Defibrillation (PAD) program. The program provides
guidance for Automated External Defibrillators (AED) in strategic locations based upon
population traffic and occupational or cardiac arrest risk. PADs are AEDs generally intended for
use by non-medically trained individuals in base buildings. The AEDs allow ready access for
use in attempts to revive victims of sudden cardiac arrest prior to arrival of first-responder
medical personnel. This instruction identifies responsibilities, maintenance, quality assurance,
and documentation requirements. It applies to all personnel assigned, attached, or associated
units to the 8th Fighter Wing, Kunsan Air Base, Republic of Korea. Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route the AF Forms 847
from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS). The use of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial

     priority precedence. The PAD Medical Director should receive the completed report
     within one duty day of deploying the PAD. After an AED is used, the Site Coordinator
     should contact Mental Health to discuss Traumatic Stress Response (TSR) service

     1.6. Targeted Responders. “Targeted Responders” are a core group of personnel most
     likely to utilize the AED within their facility based upon staffing, type of facility, continuity,
     and risk.
        1.6.1. Those individuals identified by Site Coordinators as targeted responders must be
        trained in an approved Heart Saver CPR/AED course. Targeted responders may contact
        their Squadron CPR/BLS/AED Instructor to schedule CPR/BLS/AED training.
        1.6.2. Targeted responders shall ensure that the 8FW IMT 10, PAD Event Summary
        Sheet (Attachment 5) is filled out and given to the Site Coordinator.
     1.7. Unit Commander/Functional Unit Director. The Unit Commander/Functional Unit
     Director has the overall responsibility for the conduct of the unit’s PAD Program. The Unit
     Commander/Functional Unit Director ensures, through proper coordination with the PAD
     Site Coordinator and the PAD Medical Director, that medical objectives are maintained for
     the PAD Program within the unit.
        1.7.1. The commander of each unit shall appoint, in writing, a Unit PAD Coordinator
        (see Attachment 7) who will serve as the primary liaison between the local organization’s
        PAD program, PAD Program Coordinator, PAD Medical Director and 8 MDG Medical
        Support Squadron Logistics. The Commander must appoint a primary and alternate site
        coordinator as a minimum.
        1.7.2. The PAD program is not a medical program. It is a user program. Therefore, each
        unit commander is responsible to ensure funds are allocated for the purchase of any
        batteries, or consumable supplies and long-term training on the PAD.
        1.7.3. Due to the significance of the 8 FW PAD Program, PAD's in shared areas have
        been identified and will be coordinated by the MDG as "unfunded requirements" and
        submitted to the Wing Staff Agency: CPTS/CC for inclusion on "FW's unfunded lists"
        for presentation at the Wing's Financial Working Group Board. The 8 FW will
        appropriate funds for PAD's in shared areas, see (Attachment 8).
2. Medical Logistics and Maintenance. Acquisition and maintenance of AEDs will be
coordinated with the 8th Medical Group, Medical Logistics office. Additional Medical Logistics
responsibilities are to:
     2.1. Ensure routine maintenance is performed. Should the AED require servicing, the Site
     Coordinator will arrange this out-of-cycle maintenance with the 8 MDG Medical Logistics
     Office, BMET.
     2.2. Certify new AEDs and perform periodic accountability.
     2.3. Monitor safety recall/health device alert notifications, and ensure subsequent recall
     remedies are completed. Accountability and management of safety recalls and health device
     alert notifications will be accomplished utilizing the Defense Medical Logistics Standard
     Support System (DMLSS). AED units will be placed in this system to monitor the locations
     and points of contact, in the event of any recall or notification.
     2.4. Ensure all 8 FW AEDs are standardized for the sake of continuity and safety.
8FWI44-101 2 JULY 2014                                                                          5


3. Quality Assurance. The Medical Director or designee will review all Event Summary
Sheets to assess quality of care. The Medical Director will report to ECOMS any completed
Event Summary Sheets at the next scheduled bimonthly meeting.
4. General electrical safety procedures include:
   4.1. Do not use the AED when the rescuer or victim is soaking wet or standing in water.
       4.1.1. Do not use the AED in areas of high concentration of volatile gas or combustible
       fumes.
       4.1.2. Do not attempt to use the AED if the patient is still in contact with “live voltage”
       electrical wiring that caused the heart stoppage.
5. Acquisition. Any Work Center requesting acquisition of an AED must submit an equipment
request IAW AFI41-209, Medical Logistics Support, Section 7.28.
