     possession, or foreign country in which the installation is located.
     1.3.2. Servers and sellers of alcoholic beverages must verify the purchaser’s age with a
     photo identification card (e.g. active duty identification card, driver’s license, passport,
     reserve identification card, or family identification and privilege card).

     based on the local situation as determined by the installation commander or the senior on-site
     unit commander when there is no installation commander. Coordination with any host nation
     commander is required.
AFI34-219_90MWSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                                              5

       lowered to match that of the neighboring state to reduce the likelihood that members will
       drive while intoxicated.
       1.4.1.2. When an entire unit marks a unique or non-routine military occasion on a
       military installation, the minimum drinking age for attendees at a particular unit gathering
       may be lowered.

   beverages, including the following common groupings (each approval document must
   specifically state the alcoholic beverages that the exception covers):
       1.4.2.1. Beer only.

   information copy of the continued exceptions to HQ AFSVA/SVPB.
   1.4.4. MAJCOM Directors of Services must cancel all exceptions that no longer meet the
   above criteria.
1.5. Dram Shop Liability. The "Dram Shop" theory is a legal theory of liability, created either
by statute or court decision, which imposes upon the owner, operator, and (or) employees of any
establishment serving alcoholic beverages the duty to refuse to serve additional alcoholic
beverages to a customer who reaches or appears to be reaching the point of intoxication. When
an establishment continues to sell alcoholic beverages to such a customer and the customer
subsequently departs and causes harm to himself or herself , or to others, the owner, operator,
and (or) employees of the establishment can be held liable for damages. To protect the assets and
interests of Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIs) and the Air Force, personnel must
adhere to the following procedures:
 6                                               AFI34-219_90MWSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


     1.5.1. Flight chiefs write and publish operating instructions (OIs) that prohibit personnel
     from serving alcoholic beverages to individuals who appear intoxicated or close to being
     intoxicated.
        1.5.1.1. Servers record their understanding of this policy in the employee’s work folder,
        Supervisor’s Employee Brief, by signing underneath this statement: "I understand my
        responsibility under the dram shop theory of liability not to sell or serve alcoholic
        beverages to persons who appear to be nearing intoxication and not in complete control
        of their faculties." The statement is placed in the comments section of the employee’s
        work folder by the server’s supervisor.
        1.5.1.2. The AAFES Commander prescribes the statement to be signed by all AAFES
        employees.
     1.5.2. Activity managers ensure proper safeguards or controls to protect the welfare of an
     intoxicated patron.
     1.5.3. Activity managers promptly report any incident that may result in a potential claim to
     the Services commander or division chief (refer to AFI 34-208, Property and Casualty
     Program). AAFES activity managers will report to the AAFES general manager for the base.
1.6. Drunk and Drugged Driving Program. Under the direct guidance of the installation
commander, the Services commander or division chief and AAFES manager, must be familiar
with the spirit and intent of all Air Force initiatives to eliminate drunk or drugged driving
incidents involving patrons of base Services and AAFES facilities.
     1.6.1. The installation commander ensures the base holds annual training programs to
     familiarize beverage supervisors and servers with Air Force drinking policies.
     1.6.2. The training must cover:

        influence of alcohol.
     1.6.3. Supervisors document this training in each employee’s work folder.
     1.6.4. AAFES conducts the training for its employees.
     1.6.5. Flight chiefs must develop OIs for activities serving alcoholic beverages. The OIs
     must emphasize:
        1.6.5.1. The importance of curtailing alcohol or drug influenced incidents.
        1.6.5.2. The principles of dram shop liability.
        1.6.5.3. The responsibilities of employees in carrying out the drunk and drugged driving
        program.
        1.6.5.4. The importance of encouraging patrons to use a "designated driver" or "buddy"
        system.
        1.6.5.5. The provisions of the alcohol deglamorization program.
AFI34-219_90MWSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                                               7


1.7. Alcohol Deglamorization Program. Installation commanders, AAFES managers, and
Services activity managers implement the Air Force’s Alcohol Deglamorization Program at the
base level.
   1.7.1. To oversee the base program, installation commanders follow these procedures:
      1.7.1.1. Use base media (newspapers, bulletins, etc.) to deglamorize alcohol, call for
      responsible drinking, and show that alcoholism is a treatable condition.
      1.7.1.2. Ensure activities serving alcoholic beverages don’t promote excessive drinking.
      1.7.1.3. Ensure activities serving alcoholic beverages also offer nonalcoholic beverages.
      1.7.1.4. Approve the hours during which alcoholic beverages by the drink are sold on the
      installation.

      provide reasonable service, meet local conditions, and recognize the unique needs of
      military personnel.
      1.7.1.6. Ensure there is no award of coupons for reduced prices on alcoholic beverages.
      1.7.1.7. Ensure alcoholic beverages are not provided free of charge except for
      promotional tastings as approved by the installation commander.
   1.7.2. The following guidance applies at all Air Force installations, but the installation
   commander can provide waivers on a case-by-case basis. The installation commander cannot
   delegate the waiver authority.
      1.7.2.1. The MAJCOM Director of Services secures the approval of the MAJCOM/CC
      for any command-wide exceptions.
      1.7.2.2. AAFES managers and Services activity managers observe the following
      procedures when offering alcoholic beverages, by the drink, at reduced prices:

          1.7.2.2.3. Reduce prices no more than 50 percent except for beverages offered as
          complimentary with a meal.
          1.7.2.2.4. Don’t serve two-for-one drinks.
      1.7.2.3. Services activity managers observe these procedures when operating bars:
          1.7.2.3.1. Don’t operate pro rata bars that require nondrinkers to share the cost of
          alcoholic beverages unless a pay-as-you-go bar isn’t practical or all the members of a
          group volunteer to share the cost.
          1.7.2.3.2. Don’t include the cost of alcoholic beverages in a package price for a meal,
          party, or other function (includes dining-in or -out) without offering a comparable
          nonalcoholic option.
          1.7.2.3.3. Don’t use terms that glamorize alcoholic beverages or their consumption
          ("sick calls," "attitude adjustment hours," and so on).
          1.7.2.3.4. Use the term "social hour" in all written advertisements and provide a
          range of programs that include more than just reduced prices on alcoholic beverages.
 8                                               AFI34-219_90MWSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


            1.7.2.3.5. Reduce prices for nonalcoholic beverages when reducing prices for

            1.7.2.3.7. Prohibit drinking contests.

      SELLING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES FOR OFF-PREMISE CONSUMPTION

3.1. AAFES. AAFES is designated as the single manager of packaged alcoholic beverage
(Class Six) stores and the prime wholesaler of alcoholic beverages. The Air Force packaged
beverage policy appears in AFJI 34-210, Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES)
Operating Policies.
3.2. Base Services Activities. Services and other Air Force activities may not compete with
AAFES to sell packaged alcoholic beverages. When approved by the installation commander,
Services activities may sell beer, wine coolers, and other commercially packaged alcoholic
beverages with less than seven percent alcoholic content by volume for off-premises
consumption, but must restrict these sales to time periods when AAFES-operated retail outlets on
the installation are closed. Services may not offer package alcohol for a lower price than AAFES
charges for the same item.
   3.2.1. Packaged beer or wine sales that Services offers as part of a party contract or takeout
   food and beverage operation are exempt from this restriction. Takeout operations normally
   may only sell 6-pack containers and similarly packaged products to include keg beer.
   3.2.2. Clubs may sell bottled wines and champagnes listed on the dining room wine list for
   off-premise consumption under these conditions:
       3.2.2.1. Clubs may not set up rooms separate from the dining room to display or sell for
       off-premise consumption.
       3.2.2.2. Clubs ensure that dining room list prices comply with the pricing policy
       specified in paragraph 3.6.
   3.2.3. Club and Class Six outlet managers must ensure that package alcohol sales are made
   only to patrons authorized to use the Class Six store. (Refer to paragraph 3.4 for specific
   instructions on authorized patronage and the attachment for the definition of Class Six.)
   Managers must inform patrons of the maximum quantities that an individual may legally
   transport into or through the state, district, territory, or country where the installation-of-
   purchase is located.
3.3. Establishing Class Six Outlets.
   3.3.1. In the United States, installations may operate Class Six outlets when approved by the
   Secretary of the Air Force. AFJI 34-210 contains procedures for establishing a Class Six
   store.
   3.3.2. In foreign areas overseas, installations may operate Class Six outlets where there is no
   contradictory status-of-forces or other country-to-country or local governmental agreement.
       3.3.2.1. MAJCOMs or Field Operating Agencies (FOA) may approve such operations if
       requested by AAFES. MAJCOMs and FOAs must send an information copy of each
       approval to HQ AFSVA/SVPB at least 30 days prior to approving a new Class Six store.
AFI34-219_90MWSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                                            15


3.4. Authorized Patronage.
   3.4.1. Interservice publication AFJI 34-210 contains AAFES Class Six patronage restrictions
   and identification procedures.
   3.4.2. Authorized patronage in foreign overseas areas must comply with the provisions of
   the status-of-forces or other country-to-country agreements in each country.
3.5. Controlling Sales. Authorized patrons may not sell, exchange, or otherwise divert
packaged alcoholic beverages to unauthorized personnel or for purposes that violate Federal,
state, or local laws, or status-of-forces or other country-to-country agreements.
3.6. Pricing. Services activity managers must ensure their prices for packaged alcoholic
beverages containing less than seven percent alcohol by volume are no lower than those charged
by AAFES and substantially uniform with other military service outlets in the same geographic
area.
3.7. Wholesale Sales. AAFES is the prime wholesaler of alcoholic beverages on Air Force
installations.
   3.7.1. AAFES provides all requested alcoholic beverage products to authorized Services and
   NAF-supported base activities.
   3.7.2. If AAFES has stock shortages, activities selling alcoholic beverages by the drink have
   first priority.
   3.7.3. AAFES sets wholesale prices based on the "landed cost". A Class Six store pays for
   alcohol purchases (the purchase order price that the store pays, adjusted for vendor and
   invoice discounts, plus costs incurred to bring goods to the point of sale). AAFES assesses no
   additional transportation, warehousing distribution, or handling charges.
       3.7.3.1. AAFES notifies HQ AFSVA/SVP if exceptional conditions (national disasters,
       transportation strikes, etc.) arise that affect wholesale prices.
   3.7.4. Sale of Class Six merchandise to any non-MWR/NAF organizations or activities will
   be authorized IAW Army Regulation (AR) 215-1/AFR 215-7. Sale price will be at no less
   than full retail price or as determined by Commander, AAFES.
   3.7.5. Services and other NAF-supported activities may purchase alcoholic beverages from
   sources other than AAFES. Compliance with paragraph 1.6 is mandatory.
3.8. Labeling Packaged Alcoholic Beverages.
   3.8.1. Public Law 100-690, Title VIII, Alcoholic Beverages Labeling Act of 1988, 18
   November 1988, requires that all packaged containers of alcoholic beverages for resale on
   military installations bear this statement: “GOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) According to
   the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because
   of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to
   drive a car or operate machinery and may cause health problems.”
   3.8.2. This requirement also applies to foreign packaged beverages that Services activities
   serve or sell overseas.
   3.8.3. The selling activity’s manager must label all beverages that the producer doesn’t label.
   Follow these labeling requirements:
16                                        AFI34-219_90MWSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


     3.8.3.1. PL 100-690 defines alcoholic beverages as any beverage in liquid form that
     contains not less than one-half of one percent (0.5 percent) of alcohol by volume for
     human consumption.
     3.8.3.2. Design all labels to make the health warning statement readily legible under
     ordinary conditions. The statement must be on a contrasting background.
     3.8.3.3. Label all containers of 237 milliliters (8 ounces) or less: 1 millimeter
     (0.04 inches) sized lettering.
     3.8.3.4. Label all containers of more than 237 milliliters (8 ounces): 2 millimeters
     (0.08 inches) sized lettering.
