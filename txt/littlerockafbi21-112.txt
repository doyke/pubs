This instruction implements AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management,
and applies to all applicable 19th Airlift Wing (19 AW) units. This instruction outlines policies
and assigns responsibilities for implementing an Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). It
is used in conjunction with established instructions listed in Attachment 1. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: Changing (GMS) Ground Maintenance System to DTADS (Data Transfer and
Diagnostic System). Removed 314th AW from publication since the 314th has a publication for
this program.
1. General.
   1.1. The C-130 ASIP is managed by the C-130 System Program Office, WR-ALC/LBRA.
   This office analyzes data provided by Operations and Maintenance units using a web based

     program called Automated Inspection, Repair, Corrosion and Aircraft Tracking (AIRCAT).
     Operations Group (OG) personnel input aircraft usage data using the Usage Data Input (UDI)
     segment. Maintenance Group (MXG) personnel utilize the Inspection, Corrosion And Repair
     Recording (ICARR) segment for documenting required ASIP inspections, aircraft structural
     repairs and reports of damage to aircraft structures as well as submit C-130J Data Transfer
     and Diagnostic System (DTADS) downloads to AIRCAT. A major function of the United
     States Air Force (USAF)-AIRCAT system is to provide data to generate the ASIP report.
     This report is used to make decisions regarding modifications, acquisition, reassignment and
     retirement of the Air Force C-130 aircraft.
        1.1.1. Usage reporting from the Operations Group is used to establish the inspection
        intervals for the aircraft, determine the service life of major components and the schedule
        of aircraft retirements. The replacement of the center and outer wings are predicted from
        this data.
        1.1.2. Maintenance Group reporting is necessary to determine frequency of inspections
        on aircraft. Repairs that are installed on primary structure can change standard inspection
        requirements or necessitate new inspections in order to insure the safety of the aircraft.
