SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include the implementation of 439AW Form 21, Debrief Form. It also updates requirements for
maintenance and procedures for utilization of the Debrief form.
1. Debriefing Procedures.
   1.1. The 439th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (439 AMXS) Production Supervisors or their
   representative will debrief the aircraft as follows:
       1.1.1. Meet the aircraft upon its arrival and conduct a debrief utilizing the 439 AW Form
       21, Debrief form, maintained and supplied by 439th Maintenance Operations Squadron
       (MOS) Maintenance Operations Center (MOC).
2                                                           439AWI21-107 27 AUGUST 2013


       1.1.2. Review each aircrew generated discrepancy to ensure sufficient information is
       provided for adequate troubleshooting, request specialist assistance as needed.
       1.1.3. Review the G081–Batch 67089-04, Previous Aircrew Discovered Discrepancies,
       to determine if any discrepancy should be identified as Repeat or Recurring.
       1.1.4. Ensure the appropriate Red symbols, Work Unit Codes and base station codes
       (off- station completed discrepancies only) have been entered on the Air Force Technical
       Order (AFTO) Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
       1.1.5. Ensure the flight crew has identified open discrepancies as Mission Essential or
       Mission Capable (transient aircraft only).
       1.1.6. Ensure the AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
       Document, is properly documented and transcribe all pertinent information to the new
       form.
       1.1.7. Identify and report the following information to the 439 MOC, Production
       Supervisor, and the 439th Quality Assurance (MXQ) office: discrepancies or malfunctions
       that may warrant aircraft impoundment, dropped objects, Foreign Object Damage
       mishaps, and bird strikes.
       1.1.8. Ensure the Malfunction Detection Analysis and Recording System Personal
       Computer Memory Card International Association data storage card and Compact Discs
       are collected and delivered to the G081 office for processing.
       1.1.9. Remove and forward the completed AFTO 781, Arms Aircrew/Mission Flight
       Data Document, and AF Form 4097, Aircraft Identification, to Plans Scheduling &
       Documentation (PS&D). 439th PS&D will enter aircraft hours into G081 and forward the
       completed form to the Operations Squadron.
       1.1.10. Deliver the forms binder to 439th MOC for input of discrepancies into G081.
       Note: A duplicate copy of forms and discrepancies will be given to MOC in order to
       facilitate maintenance recovery. When the MOC is unmanned, the forms will be retained
       and delivered at the beginning of the next duty day.
    1.2. MOC will accomplish the following:
       1.2.1. Update the G081 system, Aircraft Status – Arrival/Departure, screen to indicate
       the aircraft has landed.
       1.2.2. Ensure “Repeat” or “Recurring” discrepancies are properly identified in G081.
       1.2.3. Enter the following types of discrepancies into the appropriate programs in G081.
          1.2.3.1. Open discrepancies not previously loaded.
          1.2.3.2. Occurrences of in-flight engine shutdowns.
          1.2.3.3. Completed AFTO 781A discrepancies that contain all historical data
          generated during the mission.
       1.2.4. Coordinate with the appropriate 439th AMXS Production Supervisor to determine
       the current aircraft status.

      1.2.5. Load the required aircraft inspection package; i.e., Basic Post Flight, Thru-flight,
      or Home Station Check.
      1.2.6. Generate a new AFTO 781A/K set of forms when requested to do so by the 439 th
      AMXS Production Supervisor, Expeditor or aircraft crew chief.
      1.2.7. Maintain the completed 439 AW Form 21 and supply a new Form and Dropped
      Object Worksheet.
      1.2.8. Scan completed 439 AW Form 21 to appropriate aircraft folder on L-Drive.
      L:\MOS\MOC\Debrief
2. Abort/Incident Reporting.
   2.1. The MOC will notify the 439th Maintenance Group Commander (439 MXG/CC) and
   439 MXQ by e-mail of each occurrence of aborts (Ground/ Air) and incidents. MXQ will use
   the information to generate the required reports and/or gather information to facilitate further
   action and/or investigations as necessary.
   2.2. Maintenance related incidents are defined as a malfunction that causes a delay of the
   sortie/launch but does not fall into the definitions of ground or air abort. Note: Incidents are
   tracked by the Maintenance Operations Squadron Analysis section for trending purposes.
   2.3. The 439th MXQ office will originate the Abort/Incident Investigation worksheet. The
   worksheet will be forwarded to the appropriate maintenance shop(s) for corrective action
   entries and associated documentation then routed back as indicated on the report. Once
   routing is complete, 439 MXQ will review the report for final comment and filing. Data
   extracted from completed reports will be loaded into a locally developed abort/incident
   analysis program for tracking and trend analysis. Significant findings will be forwarded to
   the 439 MXG/CC for review/action.
