SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This summary changes Financial Plan (FP) to Execution Plan (EP). The EP allows for focus on
three important areas: (1) Plans/strategies to live within available funding levels; unfunded
requirements will no longer be the focus; (2) Critical financial information that provides
accurate, timely and relevant O&M information; and (3) Submission timing that allows decision-
makers to understand and approve the use of funds prior to the start of the fiscal year. (1.18.)
Unfunded requirements: A priority listing of valid priority requirements that are not funded at

either the Wing or Group (RCM) level. These will be submitted to the Wing Resource
Management Board as required for review/approval and/or submission to HQ AFSPC upon
request. (2) Budget Formulation – Policy and Procedures. The budget formulation process
primarily involves preparing an Execution Plan (EP) during Feb-Mar to build an executable
budget for the next fiscal year. (2.3.) Budget Execution Review (BER) is deleted. Table 1.
Resources Working Group Membership and Table 2. Resources Management Board (updated).
(3.14.) Reviews and validates requirements submitted by 45 SW activities during the preparation
of Execution Plan. RMB is changed to FMB. Directives DFAS-DER 7200-1 changed to DFAS-
DE 7200.1-R, Administrative Control of Appropriations and DFAS-DER 177-102 to DFAS-DE
7010.2-R, Commercial Transactions at Base Level. (4.5.5.) (changed) Develop budget
requirements in formats required by the Execution Plan drill issued by 45 CPTS/FMA.
Attachment 1, 45 SW/FMA Budget Activity Codes (BAC) and Program Element Codes (PECs)
and Attachment 2, Selected Element of Expense/Investment Codes (EEICs) (updated).
1. Terms Explained.
     1.1. Operating Budget Authority (OBA). The approved annual financing issued to 45 SW
     by HQ AFSPC.
     1.2. Execution Plan (EP). The EP allows for focus on three important areas: (1)
     Plans/strategies to live within available funding levels; unfunded requirements will no longer
     be the focus; (2) Critical financial information that provides accurate, timely and relevant
     O&M information; and (3) Submission timing that allows decision-makers to understand and
     approve the use of funds prior to the start of the fiscal year.
     1.3. Direct Budget Authority (DBA). Such funding pertains to an installation’s obligations
     and expenses for operating facilities, purchasing materials, and so forth, of unit missions and
     for which reimbursement is not received.
     1.4. Reimbursable Budget Authority (RBA). Authority allowed an installation to incur
     expenses for goods or services on behalf of customers. When services are rendered, the
     reimbursement is earned and funds are collected from the customer.
     1.5. Total Obligation Authority (TOA). The combined total of Direct and Reimbursable
     funding authority located at an installation for a given fiscal year.
     1.6. Budget Activity Code (BAC). The broadest and most basic structural accounting
     elements used in the Resource Management System (RMS). There are four BACs currently
     used in the USAF. Each BAC is a broad aggregation of smaller or specific elements that
     either complement each other or are closely related. Reprogramming annual funds between
     BACs at wing level is not authorized. BACs used by 45 SW are shown at Attachment 1.
     1.7. Program Elements (PEs). A combination of personnel, equipment and facilities that
     constitutes an identifiable military capability or support activity. Program Elements used by
     45 SW are shown in Attachment 1.
     1.8. DOD and Air Force Element of Expense/Investment Codes (EEICs). Codes designed
     for the DOD and USAF financial management system to identify the nature of services and
     items acquired for immediate consumption (expenses) or capitalization (investments). (See
     Attachment 2 for listing of selected EEICs.)
45SWI65-602 22 AUGUST 2011                                                                   3


  1.9. Responsibility Center (RC). An organization headed by a single person, Responsibility
  Center Manager (RCM), to whom financial management responsibility and legal
  accountability are assigned and who exercises a significant degree of control over resources
  acquired and consumed. At 45 SW this is the wing commander, groups commanders and the
  Civil Engineer. This level is designated by the first two digits in the RC/CC. Subordinate to
  RCs are commanders of organizations, or chiefs of staff agencies, and are identified by the
  first four digits of the RC/CC code. Third-level RCs are subordinate to second-level RCs,
  and are identified by the third and fourth digits of the RC/CC code. All RCs are composed of
  one or more cost centers.
  1.10. Cost Center (CC). This is a level of management in the organization usually
  equivalent to the working level and identified by the 5th digit of the RC/CC code. CCs are
  always subordinate to an RC who is subordinate to the RCM.
  1.11. Cost Account (CA). This is a level of management in the organization representing the
  lowest level to which expenses are accumulated in the general accounting system. A CA is
  identified by the 6th digit of the RC/CC code. CAs are always subordinate to the CC
  identified by the fifth digit of their RC/CC code.
  1.12. Financial Advisors (FAs). Individuals appointed by RCMs to manage the financial
  resources and lead in the preparation, revision and execution of their operating budgets. FAs
  usually are full-time appointments at the RC Level, not an additional duty to the Cost Center
  or Job Order Manager positions. Financial Advisors at the group/staff agency level are
  appointed in writing by the group commander. FAs are the primary point of contact for
  budget, finance and costing matters for their responsibility center. Deputy commanders are
  the designated voting members of the RWG. However, FAs may be appointed as the voting
  member of the RWG at the discretion of the RCM. In accordance with AFI 65-601, FAs are
  responsible for ensuring training of alternate FAs and their deputy commander, Resource
  Advisors (RA) and Job Order Managers (JOMs) on the Resource Management System.
  1.13. Resource Advisors (RA). The CC is the basic production organization in the chain of
  command. The RA manages on a day-to-day basis the consumption of work hours, supplies,
  equipment and services, and advises the RC Financial Advisor in allocating resources within
  their CC to ensure mission accomplishment.
  1.14. Automated Reports. Monthly or as required financial reports produced by the
  Executive Financial Information System (EFIS) and BQ Select system reflect EEIC charges
  against specific RCs and CCs. These reports are primarily used by RC Managers and their
  Financial Advisors.
  1.15. Commitment. A commitment is a specific amount of currently available funds
  reserved for specific obligations. It is based on firm requisitions, purchase requests,
  directives requiring actual procurement actions, or other authorized written evidence which
  indicates intention to incur obligations and which authorize the creation of an obligation
  without further action by the official responsible for certifying availability of funds.
  1.16. Obligation. An obligation is support recordable with documentary evidence that
  reduces available funds by:
     1.16.1. A binding written agreement between the parties involved for:
 4                                                               45SWI65-602 22 AUGUST 2011


            1.16.1.1. Specific goods to be delivered.
            1.16.1.2. Real property to be purchased or leased.
            1.16.1.3. Work or services to be performed.
        1.16.2. A valid loan agreement showing amount of loan and terms of repayment.
        1.16.3. An order required by law to be placed with a government agency.
        1.16.4. A document evidencing any other legal liability of the U.S. against an
        appropriation or fund legally available.
     1.17. Undelivered Orders Outstanding (UOO). An UOO is the value of a contract held in
     suspense until the related resource is received and the costs are charged to a customer.
     Normally, undelivered orders are recorded only in the contractual services area; however,
     they may exist in other areas.
     1.18. Unfunded Requirements. This is a priority listing of valid priority requirements that
     are not funded at either the wing or group (RCM) level. These will be submitted to the Wing
     Resource Management Board as required for review/approval and/or submission to HQ
     AFSPC upon request.
2. Budget Formulation – Policy and Procedures. The budget formulation process primarily
involves preparing an Execution Plan (EP) during Feb-Mar to build an executable budget for the
next fiscal year.
     2.1. The Financial Analysis Section, 45 CPTS/FMA, prepares a letter providing guidance for
     submission of the specific fund requirements by the RCMs. This includes specific details
     that include suspense dates, special schedules or exhibits and general information for
     handling unfunded amounts.
     2.2. FAs determine total funded and unfunded requirements for the RCM. RAs provide
     financial support to the Financial Advisor and Deputy Commander and JOMs. These
     requirements are reviewed, approved and signed by the RCMs or their Deputy and forwarded
     to 45 SW/FMA. The submission will include:
        2.2.1. A consolidated summary by EEIC of total fund requirements.
        2.2.2. A narrative justification of all fund requirements. This will include, as applicable,
        overall objectives, program authority and necessity of the requirement; assumptions and
        administrative policies; mission and activity changes and their effect on the Operating
        Budget; price changes and rates; status of inventories; basis of computing requirements;
        and other data required to adequately support fund requirements. In addition, a concise
        statement will be included outlining mission impact if the funds are not approved as
        requested.
        2.2.3. Applicable schedules or exhibits (examples or guidance will be provided by
        45 CPTS/FMA).
3. Resource Management System. The 45 CPTS/FMA Resource Management System will be
administered primarily by the following:
     3.1. Resources Working Group (RWG):
45SWI65-602 22 AUGUST 2011                                                                  5

45SWI65-602 22 AUGUST 2011                                                                     7


      3.2.4. Establishes local financial policy.
   3.3. Resource Management System (RMS) Training:
      3.3.1. In accordance with AFI65-601, 45 SW/FM is responsible to provide and account
      for RMS training to Group Commanders and their Financial Advisors, with training open
      to RAs and JOMs.
4. Budget Execution – Policy and Procedures.
   4.1. General. The Financial Analysis Officers, 45 CPTS/FMA, will administer overall wing
   approved operating budgets to ensure effective management of financial resources and to
   ensure the accomplishment of missions within approved programs, priorities and budgeted
   amounts. The Financial Analysis office is responsible for overall management of the
   financial process and assists the RCMs in their management of RCM-level program funds.
   The Financial Analysis Officer will provide the RMB with periodic progress reports on the
   status of these objectives.
   4.2. Distribution of Approved Operating Budgets:
      4.2.1. Upon receipt of the HQ AFSPC approved Operating Budget, the Financial
      Analysis Section (45 CPTS/FMA) will prepare a proposed distribution by RCM of annual
      targets for presentation to the RWG.
      4.2.2. The RWG will assess the 45 CPTS/FMA proposal; update it to conform to known
      changes in mission, funding policies, priorities, requirements, and so forth; and present a
      recommended, balanced program to the RMB for approval.
      4.2.3. Upon approval of the RMB, the FAs provide their RCMs initial redistribution to
      45 CPTS/FMAB within each PEC. 45 CPTS/FMAB will ensure that these approved
      programs are provided to the accounting system for “loading” into the appropriate
      computer systems in accordance with AFM 177-370, USAF Standard Base-Level
      General Accounting and Finance System.
      4.2.4. Under normal circumstances, operating budget targets and limitations will not be
      distributed below the four-digit RC level.
   4.3. Reprogramming of Approved Operating Budget Amounts:
      4.3.1. HQ AFSPC/FM imposes O&M direct funding limitations and reprogramming
      authority, which must be passed on to the RCMs. These are:
          4.3.1.1. Total expense and obligation requirements consist of direct and reimbursable
          targets. 45 CPTS/FMA controls reimbursable targets. Reimbursements earned in
          excess of programmed amounts support increased direct fund availability to the
          45 SW. All program amounts are locked into a fixed, total approved program, minus
          unearned reimbursements. FAs can justify adjustments to reimbursable targets as
          appropriate. Requests are sent to 45 CPTS/FMAB. Upon 45 CPTS/FMAB
          concurrence, reimbursable targets will be adjusted.
          4.3.1.2. Within the Direct Operating Budget, the amounts for each Budget Activity
          Code (BAC) constitute limitations that cannot be exceeded or reprogrammed without
          HQ AFPSC approval.
8                                                            45SWI65-602 22 AUGUST 2011


          4.3.1.3. The Direct Operating Budget and each of the subsidiary BACs are issued on
          a cumulative quarterly and annual basis. The annual programs can only be changed
          with HQ AFSPC approval. Quarterly funds may be reprogrammed between BACs
          without HQ AFSPC approval.
          4.3.1.4. Specific limitations that may be imposed by higher headquarters.
          4.3.1.5. Within each BAC, and other than the exceptions noted above, 45 SW/CC has
          complete flexibility to reprogram between PEs/EEICs.
       4.3.2. Local reprogramming authorities and procedures:
          4.3.2.1. The following basic principles are prescribed:
              4.3.2.1.1. RC Financial Advisors may request redistribution, within their RCM,
              of amounts provided to specific EEICs and Program Element Codes (PEC).
              4.3.2.1.2. Reprogramming actions between Responsibility Center Managers
              (RCMs) or major RCs/PEs may be accomplished with approval of the Financial
              Analysis Officer (45 SW/FMA) and the RCM Financial Advisors involved.
          4.3.2.2. The effects of revised reimbursable requirements upon the organizations’
          fund targets must be considered and addressed in the Advisor deficit and surplus
          briefings to the Resources Working Group. Adjustments to FA fund targets will be
          accomplished to the extent possible from existing DBA/RBA funds.
              4.3.2.2.1. Although the Operating Budget is essentially an expense based
              management system, obligations are also controlled under Section 1341, 1341,
              and 1517 of Title 31 (3U.S.C. 665), and DFAS-DER 7200.1-R, Administrative
              Control of Appropriations. The difference between amounts expensed during an
              accounting period and the amount obligated in the same period is shown as
              undelivered orders outstanding (UOO). Each RC Financial Advisor must
              consider the total expenses and obligated amounts reflected in various financial
              reports when assessing the status of the financial program. Target amounts must
              cover both expenses and obligations. The latter is a statutory limitation.
              4.3.2.2.2. UOO amounts normally apply only to contractual agreements.
              Usually, contracts less than $1,000 will be expensed at the time of obligation,
              while others will be expensed at a monthly rate dependent upon the term of the
              contract, and so forth. Specific guidance is contained in DFAS-DER 7010.2-R,
              Commercial Transactions at Base Level (PA). This process will be accomplished
              by DFAS/DAO-DE. Both the Financial Advisors and 45 CPTS/FMA must
              monitor accounting and management reports and note deviations in programmed
              versus actual expensed amounts.
    4.4. Responsibility Center Manager (RCM). The RCM is responsible for:
       4.4.1. Reviewing resource requirements of subordinate units.
       4.4.2. Integrating requirements into a RC operating budget.
       4.4.3. Justifying requirements before the RMB and the 45 SW/CC.
45SWI65-602 22 AUGUST 2011                                                                   9


     4.4.4. Determining the proper distribution of the organizational approved operating
     budget.
     4.4.5. Analyzing the plans and performance of each subordinate CC quarterly. This
     analysis identifies imbalances in resource distribution and ensures resource consumption
     contributes effectively to mission accomplishment. During this review, causes of
     overages and shortages are identified. Alternative actions are discussed and decisions
     made to bring programs into line with previous forecasts.
     4.4.6. Notifying 45 CPTS/FMA, in writing, when incumbents of Financial Advisor
     positions are changed in order for 45 CPTS/FMA to effect the Resource Management
     System (RMS) training as required in AFI 65-601.
  4.5. Responsibility Center Financial Advisor (FA) Responsibilities. FAs are charged with
  managing and analyzing expenses applicable to their respective RC programs. They will:
     4.5.1. Develop internal policies and procedures to obtain expense requirements from,
     distribute targets to, and control expenditures of, subordinate cost centers.
     4.5.2. Notify subordinate resource advisors of their initial operating budget targets
     (quarterly and annually) and all changes to these targets as they occur.
     4.5.3. Review the Comptroller Financial Information System (CFIS) and determine the
     overall status of each responsibility center’s operating expense budget and
     manage/monitor expenses and obligations recorded against current operating budgets to
     ensure that approved targets are not exceeded.
     4.5.4. Brief the status of the RC’s approved program at RWG meetings and RMB
     meetings as required.
     4.5.5. Develop budget requirements in formats required by the Execution Plan drill
     issued by 45 CPTS/FMA.
     4.5.6. Ensure RMS training is provided to all assigned Resource Advisors as specified in
     AFI 65-601.
  4.6. Resource Advisor.     The RA performs the following functions in the financial
  management system:
     4.6.1. Serves as point of initial action in the building block process of Operating Budget
     development.
     4.6.2. Develops resource requirements and justifications of inputs to the Operating
     Budget.
     4.6.3. Manages resources consumed, work performed and products produced to provide
     the basis for resource alignments. RAs are expected to perform a positive, active role in
     the Resource Management System.
