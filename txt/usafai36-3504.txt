This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-20, Accession of Air Force
Military Personnel, DoD Directive (DoDD) 1332.23, Service Academy Disenrollment, and Air
Force Instruction (AFI) 36-3504, Disenrollment of United States Air Force Academy Cadets by
providing direction for administratively disenrolling, transferring, and discharging cadets from
the United States (US) Air Force Academy, cadets who do not satisfy the conditions of
enrollment and/or commissioning. This publication has limited applicabilty to Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) and/or the Air National Guard (ANG). Refer recommended changes
and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, route AF Form 847 from the field

This is a new instruction. It substantially revises the processes and procedures involved in the
disenrollment and discharge of cadets and must be completely reviewed. This instruction
supplements and must be read in conjunction with AFI 36- 3504.

The purpose of this instruction is to provide procedural guidance to address the disposition of
cadets who fail to meet USAFA standards. Specifically, it provides the processes for
disenrollment, transfer and discharge, to include resolution of the following issues: Should a
cadet be disenrolled from the Academy? If so, should the cadet nonetheless be retained in the
 2                                                                                    USAFAI36-3504 21 AUGUST 2013


Air Force in some capacity other than that of a cadet? If the cadet should be retained in the Air
Force, to what part of the Air Force should the cadet be transferred? If the cadet should not be
retained in the Air Force, how should discharge from the Air Force be accomplished, what
characterization of discharge is appropriate, and how much, if any, of the cost of the cadet's
Academy education be charged to the cadet? Careful attention to the processes provided should
ensure fair and appropriate outcomes for individual cadets and the institution.

   2.5. USAFA Committees. The following boards and committees evaluate and sometimes

           2.5.3.2. Refer cadets for possible disenrollment.
3. Conditions Supporting Disenrollment. The Secretary of the Air Force can end the service
of a USAFA cadet when the Secretary determines it is in the best interest of the Air Force. Any
organization discovering disenrollment eligible conditions should identify such cadets as early as
practical and take proper corrective, disenrollment, discharge, or court-martial action promptly.
   3.1. The Air Force disenrolls cadets who:
       3.1.1. Fail to comply with their Academy enrollment agreement to complete the
       graduation requirements of USAFA and accept an Air Force commission; or
       3.1.2. Don’t show potential for commissioned service; or
       3.1.3. Fail to abide by established Air Force standards of conduct; or
       3.1.4. Are determined to be medically unfit for continued service or are determined to be
       unsuited for continued service due to other reasons.

   instruction constitutes a finding the cadet has broken the agreement to complete the course of
   instruction at the Academy, as contemplated by 10 U.S.C. § 9348(a). In accordance with
 6                                                           USAFAI36-3504 21 AUGUST 2013


     DoD 1332.23, paragraph 6.1.4.2., a cadet disenrolled as a result of being found medically
     unfit for further military service, not due to the cadet’s misconduct, shall be discharged and
     shall not be obligated further for Military Service or for reimbursing education costs (absent
     evidence of fraud, concealment, gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or
     misrepresentation). The terms of the agreement are contained in USAFA Form 205, Record
     of Acceptance, Obligation, Reimbursement, and Oath of Allegiance, or its successor.
        3.2.1. In accordance with paragraph 1.1., the Secretary of the Air Force, or a designee,
        decides whether disenrolled cadets with an Active Duty Service Commitment receive
        collateral consequences IAW AFI36-3504, paragraph 6 and below:
            3.2.1.1. An involuntary order to enlisted active duty; or
            3.2.1.2. A financial reimbursement obligation; or
            3.2.1.3. An educational delay for the purpose of allowing the disenrolled cadet to
            obtain an alternative commissioning source.
4. Enrollment and Disenrollment Acknowledgements.
     4.1. Each cadet who enters the Academy signs USAFA Form 205 agreeing to:
        4.1.1. Complete the course of instruction.
        4.1.2. Serve as a commissioned officer for at least five years.
        4.1.3. Accept an appointment in the Regular Air Force or Air Reserve Component
        (ARC) and a Military Service Obligation not to exceed eight years of service from the
        Total Active Military Service Date.
        4.1.4. If disenrolled prior to graduation, serve on active duty as an enlisted member in
        the Air Force Reserve, Active or Reserve Component, for a period of time as specified by
        the Secretary of the Air Force; or, 4.1.4.1. Or at the election of the Secretary of the Air
        Force, or a designee, reimburse the United States for education costs:
            4.1.4.1. When it is determined by the Secretary of the Air Force, or a designee, that
            fulfillment of the active duty service obligation by the cadet would not be in the best
            interests of the Air Force, due to misconduct on the part of the cadet and the cadet is
            discharged; or
            4.1.4.2. If the cadet requests and receives a voluntary disenrollment.
     4.2. Cadets who enter USAFA from an enlisted status in the regular or reserve component of
     any military service and who fail to fulfill their Academy enrollment agreement incur an
     active duty service commitment (ADSC) in return for education at the Academy to run
     concurrently with any previous ADSC incurred.
     4.3. The Secretary of the Air Force, or a designee, assigns active duty as the primary means
     of reimbursement for education. The Secretary of the Air Force, or a designee, may require
     cadets who do not serve on active duty (due to the nature of their misconduct or because they
     successfully request relief from the active duty service obligation) to reimburse the
     Government for the cost of their education, as determined by applicable finance instructions,
     or grant educational delay for the purpose of allowing the disenrolled cadet to obtain an
     alternative commissioning source.
USAFAI36-3504 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                    7


   4.4. Because reimbursement is a debt to the United States in accordance with DoDD
   1332.23, a discharge in bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C. 523, might not release a person from
   having to reimburse the United States if the final decree of bankruptcy takes effect within a
   period of five years after the last day of a period the cadet agreed to serve on active duty.
5. Pre-Appointment Misconduct. The USAFA Director of Admissions (USAFA/RR) may
deny enrollment to applicants who commit misconduct between the time they submit background
information to the Academy and the time they in-process as cadets.
   5.1. Applicants must update information they provide to USAFA/RR as part of the
   admission process.
   5.2. Applicants who intentionally withhold information may forfeit their appointment to the
   Academy.
       5.2.1. If USAFA discovers misconduct before an appointee takes the oath of
       appointment, the Academy must:
           5.2.1.1. Inform the individual.
           5.2.1.2. Provide the appointee a reasonable opportunity to respond.
   5.3. USAFA/RR withdraws the offer of appointment and notifies the nominating authority
   if, after considering the misconduct and the appointee’s response, if any, the USAFA/RR
   concludes the appointee is no longer qualified for appointment.
   5.4. The appointee will not participate in basic cadet training without taking the oath of
   appointment. The oath of appointment will not be administered until the case is resolved.
   5.5. A cadet can be disenrolled when pre-appointment misconduct is discovered after the
   oath of appointment is administered.
6. Pre-Appointment Drug, Chemical, and Alcohol Testing. As the Secretary of the Air Force
directed, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. §978, all cadet candidates must undergo testing for illegal
drug, illegal chemical, and alcohol use within 72 hours of taking the oath of appointment at
USAFA.
   6.1. Cadets who, after taking the oath of appointment, show positive test results for drugs,
   chemicals, or alcohol may be disenrolled.
       6.1.1. The Academy notifies these cadets in writing (See Attachment 2) they are being
       recommended for disenrollment based on positive drug, chemical, or alcohol test results.
       6.1.2. Military counsel will be made available to assist the cadet.
       6.1.3. A cadet may request that he/she be allowed to resign instead of going further with
       the disenrollment procedures in this instruction.
           6.1.3.1. TheAcademydocumentsthistypeofresignationas       “inlieuofdisenrollmentfor

   6.2. The Air Force assigns an entry-level characterization to cadets who have their request to
   resign accepted or are disenrolled in accordance with this paragraph, unless the cadet was
 8                                                           USAFAI36-3504 21 AUGUST 2013


     prior service and/or attended the United States Air Force Academy Preparatory School.
     Paragraph 6 does not apply in these cases.
     6.3. If USAFA discovers misconduct before an appointee takes the oath of appointment, the
     USAFA must follow provisions in paragraph 5.2.1 to 5.2.1.2 above.
7. Pre-Appointment Medical Conditions. The USAFA/RR may deny enrollment to applicants
who have medical conditions or medication use which were not previously reported.
     7.1. Applicants must update any changes in medical condition as they occur as part of the
     admission process.
     7.2. Applicants who intentionally withhold information may forfeit their appointment to the
     Academy.
        7.2.1. If USAFA discovers misconduct before an appointee takes the oath of
        appointment, the USAFA must follow provisions in paragraph 5.2.1 to 5.2.1.2 above.
8. Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) and Physical Evaluation Board (PEB). When a
question arises about a cadet’s medical fitness for continued service, USAFA conducts a medical
evaluation using the medical standard set forth in DoDI 6130.03, Medical Standards for
Appointment, Enlistment, or Induction in the Military Services and AFI 48-123, Medical
Examinations and Standards.
     8.1. If the Academy’s medical evaluation finds a cadet does not meet accessions standards
     outlined in DoDI 6130.03, Medical Standards for Appointment, Enlistment, or Induction in
     the Military Services, a medical review for accessions waiver will be conducted by the
     Surgeon General of the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA/SG) or delegated
     authority. If a cadet fails to meet retention standards, a Medical Evaluation Board (MEB)
     will be convened in accordance with AFI 36-3212, Physical Evaluation for Retention,
     Retirement, and Separation (also see AFI 41-210, TRICARE Operations and Patient
     Administration Functions; and AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards). The
     Disability Evaluation System (DES) process, under the direction of AFI 36-3212, will
     determine whether the cadet is discharged, or reassigned because of prior service, and
     disenrollment will be a consequence of that decision, unless:
        8.1.1. A medically unfit cadet who has requested graduation without a commission,
        pursuant to DODD 1322.22, Service Academies, paragraph 4.6.4. and who has been
        determined by the Superintendent to be a first class cadet and is a cadet in good standing,
        shall be permitted to graduate from the Academy, without a commission. AFPC/DPPD
        will revise the separation date of the cadet to reflect the date after the day of graduation;
        or
        8.1.2. If the cadet is also subject to involuntary disenrollment and/or discharge under this
        instruction, in which case, the dual action processing procedures will be followed.
     8.2. A cadet who is determined to be medically unfit and who has not otherwise failed to
     fulfill their obligations pursuant to their Agreement with the Academy, does not incur an
     active duty obligation (absent evidence of fraud, concealment, gross negligence, intentional
     misconduct, or misrepresentation).
     8.3. If a cadet is found to be medically fit for duty, but is determined to be unsuited for
     military service according to DoDI 6130.03, Medical Standards for Appointment, Enlistment,
USAFAI36-3504 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                    9


   or Induction in the Military Services, AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards, and
   AFI 36-3208, Administration Separation of Airmen, paragraph 5.11 (Conditions That
   Interfere with Military Service), the cadet will be subject to disenrollment and discharge as a
   deficiency in aptitude.
   8.4. Fourth Class Cadets or Basic Cadets who are identified with medical conditions or
   physical defects not compatible with military service identified within 180 days after taking
   the oath of appointment may be disenrolled and administratively discharged without referral
   to the Disability Evaluation System in accordance with DODI 1332.38, Physical Disability
   Evaluation.
9. Active Duty Service Commitments, Enlisted Grade Determinations, Reimbursement,
and Educational Delays. The Superintendent reviews active duty obligations. AFPC assigns
military grades to cadets whom the Academy disenrolls prior to graduation and retains in the Air
Force, in accordance with Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 1332.23.
   9.1. Active duty service is the primary means of reimbursement for an Academy education
   (10 U.S.C. §2005). However, the Secretary of the Air Force, or a designee, may direct
   monetary recoupment in lieu of active duty when he or she determines the cadet’s record at
   the Academy renders the cadet unsuited for active duty service, or that active duty service
   otherwise is not in the best interest of the Air Force. All such cadets who have incurred a
   military commitment and are disenrolled or resign under circumstances amounting to a
   breach of the 10 U.S.C. §9348 agreement, will be discharged from the service, and may be
   subject to monetary recoupment.
   9.2. When a cadet who is subject to monetary recoupment fails to complete the period of
   active or reserve duty specified in the agreement, or does not fulfill any term or condition
   prescribed pursuant to paragraph (4) of 10 U.S.C. § 2005(a), such person shall be subject to
   the repayment provisions of 37 U.S.C. § 303a (e).
       9.2.1. A cadet may submit a written request (stating reasons) to waive their ADSC or
       reimbursement obligation.
       9.2.2. The Superintendent will provide a recommendation for disposition to the Secretary
       of the Air Force for final decision
       9.2.3. The Academy forwards the request, the cadet’s submission, if any, and the
       recommendation of the Superintendent to the Secretary of the Air Force or designee.
   9.3. Enlisted grade is based on the cadet's class year at the time the disenrollment conduct
   occurred or the resignation was submitted and not based on the cadet's class year at the time
   of the final action. The Air Force normally assigns the following grades to separated cadets
   whom the Secretary of the Air Force, or designees, has ordered to active duty:
       9.3.1. Former Second class cadet -- Airman First Class (E-3). (EXCEPTION: The
       cadet earns a higher grade for earlier enlisted service.)
       9.3.2. Former First class cadet -- Senior Airman (E-4). These individuals must qualify at
       the five-skill level Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) to retain the grade of E-4.
       (EXCEPTION: The cadet earns a higher grade for earlier enlisted service.)
   9.4. If the Secretary of the Air Force, or designee, does not waive a cadet’s ADSC, and if the
   cadet is not discharged from the service, the Secretary of the Air Force, or a designee, may,
 10                                                         USAFAI36-3504 21 AUGUST 2013


   pursuant to DODD 1332.23, grant an “educational delay” in processing the cadet into the
   enlisted force for the purpose of allowing the cadet the opportunity to pursue an alternative
   commissioning source. The educational delay will terminate 150 days after the date of the
   Secretary of the Air Force’s, or a designee’s, order, but may be extended in 30 day
   increments, not to exceed a total of one year from the date of the Secretary of the Air Force’s,
   or a designee’s, order, upon the request of the cadet. Any such delays are at the discretion of
   the Secretary of the Air Force, or a designee. The responsibilities related to educational
   delay as assigned to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel and Services
   (AF/A1) in paragraphs 2.3.1, 2.3.4, 2.3.4.1, and 2.6.2 of AFI 36-3504, will be handled at
   USAFA by the Staff Judge Advocate, Cadet Disenrollment Section (USAFA/JACD). In the
   event an alternative commissioning source is not obtained by the cadet within the specified
   time, and in all other cases, the following actions will be taken:
       9.4.1. Directorate of Manpower and Personnel (USAFA/A1) coordinates with
       Promotions/Special Actions/Testing Office (10 MSS/DPMPE) who administers the
       Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT). 10 FSS/DPMPE will administer the AFQT
       within 2 duty days of the notification that a cadet is in need of taking the AFQT. 10
       MSS/DPMPE will inform USAFA/A1D of any test that is not administered within 2 duty
       days and provide a justification of why the AFQT could not be scheduled within 2 duty
       days.
       9.4.2. USAFA/A1 coordinates with Skills Management Division, AFPC,
       (AFPC/DPSOAA) who then coordinates with Reclassification Office (AETC/A3PA) and
       Airman Assignments Division (AFPC/DPAA) to obtain an appropriate AFSC, required
       initial skill training and duty assignment for disenrolled cadets.
       9.4.3. The Air Force calls the disenrolled cadet to active duty normally not later than 30
       days after the Secretary of the Air Force approves the disenrollment contingent upon
       receipt of the AFSC and duty assignment from AETC/A3PA and AFPC/DPAA.
   9.5. When a cadet has been found not qualified for graduation and commissioning by the
   Superintendent, the Superintendent may place the cadet on involuntary excess leave without
   pay pending the final processing of the case.
   9.6. Disenrolled cadets may submit written requests for release from their active duty service
   obligation by:
       9.6.1. Sending the request to AFPC/DPAA through USAFA/A1 for processing to the
       Secretary, or a designee, for final decision.
10. Service Characterization. The Secretary of the Air Force, or a designee, may assign four
types of discharges.
   10.1. Honorable. Assign an honorable discharge when a cadet’s record warrants the highest
   character discharge. It should be awarded when the quality of the cadets’ service has met Air
   Force standards of acceptable conduct or when the cadet’s record is otherwise so meritorious
   that any other characterization would be inappropriate. The former cadet receives:
       10.1.1. DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty.
       10.1.2. DD Form 256AF, Discharge Certificate, Honorable.
USAFAI36-3504 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                   11


   10.2. General Under Honorable Conditions (General). Assign a general discharge when a
   cadet’s service has been honest and faithful but contains significant negative aspects which
   outweigh the positive and the cadet’s record is not sufficiently meritorious to warrant an
   honorable discharge but does not warrant an honorable discharge, but does not deserve a
   discharge under other than honorable conditions. The former cadet receives a DD Form 214.
   10.3. Under Other Than Honorable Conditions (UOTHC). Assign this discharge when a
   cadet’s record warrants the least favorable type of administrative discharge and there exists a
   pattern of behavior or one or more acts or omissions that constitute a significant departure
   from the conduct expected of officer candidates. The former cadet receives a DD Form 214.
   10.4. Entry-Level. Assign an entry-level characterization when a cadet disenrolled and
   discharged within 180 days of taking the oath of appointment, unless the cadet has a prior
   service commitment that makes the cadet ineligible for the entry-level characterization and
   provisions in AFI36-3504, paragraph 12.4. The former cadet receives a DD Form 214.
11. Voluntary Resignations.
   11.1. Voluntary Tender of Resignation.
      11.1.1. All resignations that cadets tender in accordance with paragraph 11.1 are
      voluntary.
      11.1.2. Between the time a cadet tenders a resignation and receives a separation or
      discharge, the Academy may:
          11.1.2.1. Relieve the cadet of cadet wing duties and assign the cadet to other
          appropriate duties.
          11.1.2.2. House the cadet away from his/her squadron.
          11.1.2.3. Place the cadet on voluntary excess leave, in accordance with this
          instruction.
      11.1.3. The Secretary of the Air Force, or a designee, decides whether to accept a cadet’s
      resignation according to 10 U.S.C. § 9348.
      11.1.4. Resigning cadets may incur active duty obligations.
      11.1.5. A cadet may tender a voluntary resignation in writing (see Attachment 3 for a
      resignation letter template) at any time for one of the following reasons, subject to
      limitations listed in paragraph 11.1.6.
          11.1.5.1. Problems adjusting to the Air Force environment;
          11.1.5.2. Change of career goals; or
          11.1.5.3. Personal reasons.
      11.1.6. A cadet is not eligible to submit a resignation under this paragraph when he or
      she:
          11.1.6.1. Has had charges preferred against him/her under the Uniform Code of
          Military Justice (UCMJ).
          11.1.6.2. Has received notice of an involuntary discharge action based on serious
          misconduct (see paragraph 24).
12                                                        USAFAI36-3504 21 AUGUST 2013


         11.1.6.3. Has received notice of an involuntary disenrollment recommendation for
         deficiencies.
         11.1.6.4. Has received notice of that she or he is subject to the procedures in the
         USAFA Cadet Wing Honor Code Reference Handbook for resolving allegations of
         honor code violations
     11.1.7. If the Secretary of the Air Force, or designee, approves a resignation, the cadet is:
         11.1.7.1. Disenrolled;
         11.1.7.2. Receives an honorable discharge, unless the cadet is transferred because of
         a prior service commitment.
     11.1.8. Cadets who are ineligible to resign in accordance with this paragraph may
     request a resignation in accordance with paragraph 11.2 , paragraph 11.3, or paragraph
     11.4.
     11.1.9. An involuntary disenrollment for deficiencies or involuntary discharge action
     based on misconduct may be initiated if appropriate and is not precluded by a cadet’s
     tender of resignation. In such cases, all discharge characterizations applicable to that
     process will be available.
  11.2. Resigning Instead of Further Disenrollment Action.
     11.2.1. A cadet may tender a resignation (see Attachment 3 for a resignation letter
     template) after receiving written notification of a disenrollment recommendation.
     11.2.2. If the Secretary of the Air Force, or a designee, accepts the resignation, the cadet
     is disenrolled and may receive:
         11.2.2.1. An honorable discharge; or
         11.2.2.2. A general discharge (under honorable conditions).
  11.3. Resigning for the Good of the Service.
     11.3.1. A cadet whose misconduct has brought him/her to a possible court-martial or an
     involuntary discharge action based on serious misconduct may tender a resignation (see
     Attachment 3 for a resignation letter template) to request a resignation in lieu of that
     action.
     11.3.2. A cadet who requests a resignation in accordance with this paragraph does so
     with the understanding that if the Secretary of the Air Force, or a designee, accepts the
     request:
         11.3.2.1. The Air Force Academy will discharge the cadet promptly.
         11.3.2.2. The discharge will be under other than honorable conditions, unless the
         Secretary of the Air Force, or a designee, decides that the cadet deserves:
             11.3.2.2.1. An honorable discharge; or
             11.3.2.2.2. A general discharge (under honorable conditions).
     11.3.3. AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, provides guidelines for
     handling resignations in accordance with this paragraph.
USAFAI36-3504 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                  13


   11.4. Resigning In Lieu of Procedures in the USAFA Cadet Wing Honor Code Reference
   Handbook for Resolving Allegations of Honor Code Violations.
      11.4.1. A cadet may tender a resignation (see Attachment 3 for a resignation letter
      template) after receiving a notification of an allegation that the cadet violated the honor
      code.
      11.4.2. If the Superintendent accepts the resignation, the cadet is disenrolled and may
      receive:
          11.4.2.1. An honorable discharge; or
          11.4.2.2. A general discharge under honorable conditions.
12. Withdrawing a Voluntary Tender of Resignation.
   12.1. A cadet may submit a request (in writing) to the Superintendent to withdraw a
   voluntary tender of resignation submitted under paragraph 11.1 for good cause (e.g.,
   discovering evidence favorable to the cadet after submitting the resignation) prior to
   receiving notice of the Superintendent’s action on the tender of resignation.
   12.2. If a cadet requests a withdrawal before the Superintendent takes action, the
   Superintendent may:
      12.2.1. Approve the request; or
      12.2.2. Disapprove the request; and
          12.2.2.1. If additional actions are necessary by the Secretary of the Air Force, or a
          designee, send the request and disapproval forward with the case file.
   12.3. If a cadet requests a withdrawal after the Superintendent accepted the tender of
   resignation but before notice was given to the cadet, the Superintendent may request:
      12.3.1. Reconsider the acceptance of the tender of resignation and approve the request to
      withdraw it; or
      12.3.2. Disapprove the request; and
          12.3.2.1. If additional actions are necessary by the Secretary of the Air Force, or a
          designee, send the request and disapproval forward with the case file.
13. Fulfilling Service Commitments if Tender of Resignation is Accepted. Cadets who
receive approved resignations must fulfill their:
   13.1. Active duty service commitments;
   13.2. Obligations to reimburse the Government for education costs; and/or
   13.3. Other applicable obligations to the Government not terminated by resignation from
   USAFA.
14. Suspending Action on a Tender of Voluntary Resignation.
   14.1. The Superintendent may suspend further action on a voluntary tender of resignation
   upon notice of evidence indicating the commission of misconduct for the purpose of
   providing for further investigation and consideration of alternative dispositions.
 14                                                        USAFAI36-3504 21 AUGUST 2013


       14.1.1. The results of the further investigation and the voluntary tender of resignation
       will be provided to the Commandant for consideration of alternative dispositions and a
       recommendation to the Superintendent on voluntary tender of resignation.
       14.1.2. If the Superintendent had already accepted the voluntary tender of resignation but
       the resulting discharge or transfer has not been executed, Cadet Personnel
       (USAFA/A1A):
          14.1.3.1. Notifies AF/A1PT, AFPC/DPPA, and USAFA/JA that further actions
          should be suspended until USAFA completes the investigation and considers
          alternative dispositions.
15. Disenrolling Cadets for Specific Deficiencies.
   15.1. The Superintendent may disenroll:
       15.1.1. Cadets who are found deficient in:
          15.1.1.1. Conduct (e.g., minor disciplinary infractions);
          15.1.1.2. Aptitude;
          15.1.1.3. Training;
          15.1.1.4. Academics; or
          15.1.1.5. Physical Fitness/Physical Education/Intramurals/USAFA cadet weight,
          cadet body mass index (BMI), or cadet body fat standards; or
       15.1.2. Cadets who fail in:
          15.1.2.1. Academic probation;
          15.1.2.2. Conduct and/or aptitude probation;
          15.1.2.3. Athletic probation; or
          15.1.2.4. Honor probation.
       15.1.3. Cadets who fail to meet Air Force commissioning fitness assessment standards.
16. Initiating Disenrollments for Deficiencies
   16.1. The individual, board, or committee first recommending disenrollment (Initiating
   Authority) reports its findings and recommendations through the appropriate Group Air
   Officer Commanding (Group AOC) and the Commandant of Cadets.
   16.2. Recommendations for disenrollment must include recommendations regarding active
   duty service for cadets with active duty service commitments.
   16.3. The Superintendent provides justification and supporting documentation to the
   Secretary of the Air Force if he/she recommends a waiver of an active duty service
   commitment.
   16.4. The Commandant of Cadets, with advice from USAFA/JA, determines whether cases
   of misconduct should continue to be further processed based on deficiencies in conduct, or
   should be further investigated and/or initiated under procedures for an involuntary discharge
   action based on serious misconduct or processed under the UCMJ.
USAFAI36-3504 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                 15


17. Initiating Disenrollment for Deficiencies in Conduct, Minor Misconduct, and/or Failing
Conduct Probation. The cadet disciplinary system (supervised by the Commandant) identifies
cadets who fail to show the potential to continue as cadets. This includes cadets who become
ineligible to remain cadets because of paternity, maternity, or marriage.
   17.1. In most cases the Commandant, Group AOC, and the Squadron Air Officer
   Commanding through the cadet disciplinary system, should have documented attempts to
   help these cadets change their behavior.
   17.2. The Group AOC may, after documenting a case, initiate disenrollment proceedings and
   recommend disenrollment through the Commandant to the Superintendent.
       17.2.1. If cadet disciplinary procedures and a deficiency disenrollment do not adequately
       address the seriousness of the misconduct, the Group AOC may recommend that the
       Commandant initiate an involuntary discharge action for misconduct.
18. Initiating Disenrollment for Deficiency in Aptitude and/or Failing Aptitude
Probation. A low military performance average (MPA) shows a potential deficiency in aptitude
for commissioned service. However, factors used in developing the MPA (military performance
evaluation, conduct score, cadet peer evaluations, professional knowledge reviews, and officer
attribute assessments) may also independently support a disenrollment based on a deficiency in
aptitude for commissioned service.
   18.1. Other indicators of a deficiency in aptitude include:
       18.1.1. Failure to adapt to the military environment;
       18.1.2. Failure to make satisfactory progress in required training programs;
       18.1.3. Reluctance to make the effort necessary to meet Air Force standards of conduct
       and duty performance;
       18.1.4. Lack of self discipline;
       18.1.5. Failure to meet Air Force commissioning fitness assessment standards;
   18.2. Evidence that a cadet has a condition that may be unsuited for military service
   according to DoDI 6130.03, Medical Standards for Appointment, Enlistment, or Induction in
   the Military Services, AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards, and AFI 36-3208,
   Administration Separation of Airmen, paragraph 5.11 (Conditions That Interfere with
   Military Service), may independently support disenrollment based on a deficiency in aptitude
   for commissioned service.
   18.3. The Group AOCs:
       18.3.1. Review cases of cadets who exhibit deficiencies in aptitude.
       18.3.2. May recommend disenrollment.
19. Initiating Disenrollment for Deficiencies in Academic Performance and/or Failing

22. Procedures for Initiating Disenrollment for Deficiencies.
   22.1. In cases involving deficiencies in academics and/or failure in academic probation, the
   Dean of the Faculty (USAFA/DF) is the initiating authority and will initiate notification
   paperwork, notifying the cadet, through the Group AOC and the Commandant, that he/she is

         right to respond. In all cases, the cadet will be provided an opportunity to respond in
         writing.
  22.4. After reviewing the matters submitted by the cadet, the initiator of the discharge action
  will submit his/her recommendation to the disenrollment authority (the Superintendent)
  through the Commandant of Cadets () and USAFA/JA.
     22.4.1. USAFA/JA will perform a legal review of the allegations and supporting
     documentation, along with the matters submitted by the cadet, and will forward the
     disenrollment recommendation, through the Commandant of Cadets, to the
     Superintendent, for final action.
  22.5. Under these procedures, the cadet has the following rights:
     22.5.1. To receive written notice of the reasons, including the circumstances upon which
     the action is based, for disenrollment;
     22.5.2. To receive written notice of the characterization of discharge that is proposed as a

     notification letter, see the format in Attachment 5.)
     22.6.6. Obtains the cadet’s statement or statements within 3 duty days. For a sample
     format of the cadet's statement, use the format in Attachment 6. NOTE: If the cadet
     does not sign this statement, the AOC annotates the letter to show whether the cadet
     indicated that any of the rights would be exercised.
     22.6.7. Prepares a recommendation to the disenrollment authority as shown in
     Attachment 7.
  22.7. Actions by the Cadet:
     22.7.1. Acknowledges receipt of the notification letter in a statement made according to
     Attachment 5. (If the cadet does not respond or responds without signing the statement
 18                                                         USAFAI36-3504 21 AUGUST 2013


       provided, the Initiating Authority will make an appropriate notation on the statement
       regarding the cadet's failure to do so.)
       22.7.2. Consults the appointed military legal counsel.
       22.7.3. Submits statements by the date set in the notification letter (within 3 duty days of
       the date of notification) or declines the opportunity to do so. (The Initiating Authority
       may give the cadet more time if there is good reason for the request. Failure by the cadet
       to respond within 3 duty days, or by the end of an approved extension, constitutes a
       waiver of the cadet's rights. For a format of the cadet's statement, use the format in
       Attachment 6. If the cadet does not respond or responds without signing the statement
       provided, the Initiating Authority will make an appropriate notation on the statement
       regarding the cadet's failure to do so.)
   22.8. Action by the Commandant of Cadets: If the Commandant determines a basis for
   disenrollment and discharge does not exist, return the case to the Initiating Authority for
   appropriate action. If the Commandant determines a basis for disenrollment and discharge
   does exist, provides a recommendation to the Superintendent/Disenrollment Authority.
   22.9. Action by the Superintendent/Disenrollment Authority: Makes final decision to retain
   or disenroll, and if the decision is to disenroll, the disenrollment authority will also:
       22.9.1. Determine the characterization of discharge for third class and fourth class
       cadets.
       22.9.2. Recommend service as an enlisted member or discharge, service characterization,
       and recoupment of the costs of education incurred for first class and second class cadets.
23. Cadet Honor Code Violations. Violations of the Cadet Wing Honor Code will normally be
processed according to procedures in the USAFA Cadet Wing Honor Code Reference Handbook,
unless the Commandant of Cadets initiates other disposition. This instruction specifically
authorizes the use of the procedures outlined in the USAFA Cadet Wing Honor Code Reference
Handbook. Egregious violations of the Cadet Wing Honor Code should be evaluated to
determine if a UCMJ action and/or an involuntary discharge action based on serious misconduct
should be initiated.
24. Initiating Involuntary Discharge Action based on Serious Misconduct.
   24.1. The Commandant of Cadets, with advice from the Staff Judge Advocate (USAFA/JA),
   determines whether cases involving serious misconduct are initiated under the procedures for
   an honor board, disenrollment for conduct deficiencies, or an involuntary discharge action.
   24.2. If the underlying misconduct is serious enough to potentially warrant an under other
   than honorable conditions discharge characterization (UOTHC), an involuntary discharge
   action should be initiated.
   24.3. When an involuntary discharge action recommends the cadet be discharged with a
   UOTHC characterization, the procedures set forth in AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge
   Procedures for Commissioned Officers, AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers,
   and AFI 51-602, Boards of Officers, will be followed with appropriate modifications
   necessary for application to a cadet.

education costs and I wish to dispute the validity of the monetary debt, an official will be
appointed to investigate the facts and consider any evidence I wish to present regarding this
issue.
