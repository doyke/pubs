MEMORANDUM FOR 412 TW

FROM: 412 TW/CC
      195 E Popson Ave
      Edwards AFB, CA

SUBJECT: Edwards Air Force Base (AFB) Guidance Memorandum, Juvenile Intervention
Council (JIC)

RELEASABILITY: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.

      By Order of the Edwards Air Force Base Commander, this Edwards Air Force Base
Guidance Memorandum implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 51-9, Civil Law for
Individuals. Compliance with this Memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are
inconsistent with other Edwards Air Force Base publications; the information herein prevails, in
accordance with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

      This guidance memorandum provides the framework for the disposition of juvenile
misconduct cases and the treatment of juveniles on Edwards Air Force Base (AFB), CA. The
purpose of this instruction is to establish policies, responsibilities, and procedures for the
administrative disposition of misconduct committed by juveniles on Edwards AFB and to
establish the Edwards AFB Juvenile Intervention Council (JIC). The JIC will hear cases in
which a juvenile is alleged to have engaged in misconduct. Any recommendations made by the
JIC will be designed to attain the primary goal of maintaining good order and discipline on
Edwards AFB and, if possible, rehabilitating the juvenile. Notwithstanding the existence of this
instruction, AFI 51-905, Use of Magistrate Judges for Trial of Misdemeanors Committed by
Civilians, and the Federal Magistrate’s Court program will continue to apply to all offenses
committed on base by civilians. This publication is affected by the Privacy Act of 1974. Each
form that is subject to the provisions of AFI 33-332, The Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties
Program, and is required by this publication will contain a Privacy Act statement, either
incorporated in the body of the document or in a separate statement accompanying each
document.
       This Memorandum becomes void after one year has elapsed from the date of this
Memorandum, or upon incorporation by publishing an Edwards Air Force Base Instruction for
Juvenile Intervention Council (JIC), whichever is earlier.

Authority
Attachment 1-Sample Format for Juvenile Intervention Council Warning Letter
Attachment 2-Sample Format for Letter Notifying Juvenile of JIC Meeting
Attachment 3-Sample Format for Juvenile Intervention Council Decision
1. Authority.

1.1. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, provides that the 412 TW/CC is responsible for protecting
government property and personnel from hostile and criminal acts. To achieve this goal, the 412
TW/CC may require that any juvenile suspected of misconduct on Edwards AFB, CA, appear
before the JIC and explain why base privileges should not be limited or revoked. Privileges
subject to limitation or revocation include, but are not limited to, base exchange, base gas station,
commissary, housing, shoppette, base driving privileges, and the privilege of entering any part
(or all) of the base.

1.2. Pursuant to DoDI 5200.8, Security of DoD Installations and Resources, Paragraph 3.2, the
412 TW/CC has the authority to take reasonably necessary and lawful measures to maintain law
and order and to protect Edwards AFB personnel and property. Paragraph 3.2.2 states that this
authority includes the removal from, or denial of access to, the installation or site of “individuals
who threaten the orderly administration of the installation.”

1.3. Commanders of DoD military installations and facilities have the authority to publish and
enforce command/installation-specific guidance and procedures for safeguarding personnel,
facilities, and property. This authority is derived from the Internal Security Act of 1950 (50
U.S.C. § 797), DoDI 5200.08, DoD 5200.08-R, Physical Security Program, and AFI 31-101.

1.4. This instruction complies with the foregoing law, regulations, and instructions by ensuring
that an offense involving a juvenile is identified, adjudicated, and disposed of in a manner that
maintains good order and discipline, while stressing deterrence and rehabilitation of the juvenile.

1.5. As stated in the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 2002 (Pub. L. No. 93-
415, 42 U.S.C. § 5601 et seq.), Congress has found that coordinated juvenile justice and
delinquency prevention projects that meet the needs of juveniles through the collaboration of the
many local service systems juveniles encounter can help prevent juveniles from becoming
delinquent and help delinquent youth return to a productive life. Congress also stressed the
importance of promoting quality juvenile delinquency prevention programs and programs that
assist in holding juveniles accountable for their actions and in developing the competencies
necessary to become responsible and productive members of their communities, including a
system of graduated sanctions to respond to each delinquent act, requiring juveniles to make
restitution (or perform community service) for the damage caused by their delinquent acts, and
methods for increasing victim satisfaction with respect to the penalties imposed on juveniles for
their acts.

1.6. Felony offenses committed by juveniles in violation of the United States Code (U.S.C.) will
continue to be prosecuted in Federal Court.

2. Establishment. There is hereby established on Edwards AFB, CA, a Juvenile Intervention
Council (JIC).

3. Purpose of the JIC. The JIC is designed to:
3.1. Maintain good order, morale, and discipline on Edwards AFB.

3.2. Educate juveniles and their sponsors on the consequences of misconduct and crime (i.e., the
impact crime has on the juvenile, the juvenile’s family, the victim(s), and the community).

3.3. Rehabilitate juveniles through counseling, education, community service, restitution, and
other means of corrective action as recommended by the JIC and directed by the 412 TW/CC.

3.4. Protect the best interests of both the juvenile and the Edwards AFB community; accordingly,
the system avoids labeling the juveniles with the stigma of “criminal” or “delinquent.” Rather,
the term “juvenile” is used in this instruction.

4. Jurisdiction of the JIC.

4.1. This instruction applies to all juveniles who are suspected to have engaged in misconduct on
Edwards AFB, including:

4.1.1. Juvenile dependents of personnel stationed at Edwards AFB (to include all tenant units).

4.1.2. Juvenile dependents of active duty or retired military personnel using Edwards AFB
facilities.

4.1.3. Juvenile dependents of Department of Defense (DoD) civilians or contractors.

4.1.4. Non-base affiliated juveniles who are attending school on Edwards AFB.

4.1.5. Any other juvenile on Edwards AFB for any reason.

4.2. This instruction also applies to the sponsors of juveniles who are suspected to have engaged
in misconduct on Edwards AFB.

5. Scope of the JIC.

5.1. The JIC will adjudicate cases involving non-traffic offenses, including but not limited to
simple/non-aggravated assault, battery, vandalism, trespassing, or other types of cases at the
discretion of the 412 TW/CC.

5.2. The JIC will not adjudicate traffic offenses. The 412 SFS will continue to issue a United
States District Court Violation Notice to juveniles who commit minor traffic offenses. These
offenses will continue to be processed through the Central Violations Bureau (CVB) and Federal
Magistrate Court.

5.3. Certain rehabilitative measures, such as referral to counseling, performance of community
service, or participation in a work program by the juvenile may only be imposed by the JIC if the
juvenile agrees to submit to the JIC’s jurisdiction. Participation by the juvenile in the JIC
program is voluntary; however, certain administrative sanctions may be taken immediately upon
commission of an offense against a juvenile even if the juvenile refuses to submit to the
jurisdiction of the JIC. For example, the 412 TW/CC retains the authority, under AFI 31-101, to
bar the juvenile from base or terminate base housing privileges for the juvenile’s family.
Rescission of administrative sanctions (e.g., reinstatement of privileges) may be contingent upon
the juvenile’s consent to the jurisdiction of the JIC and satisfactory completion by the juvenile
and/or his or her sponsor of rehabilitative measures recommended by the JIC and directed by the
412 TW/CC.

5.4. If a juvenile refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of the JIC, the juvenile’s case will be
referred to the Staff Judge Advocate (412 TW/JA) to determine whether to forward the case
through appropriate state or federal channels for disposition.

6. Composition of the JIC.

6.1. The JIC shall be composed of: Voting Members; Non-Voting Invitees; and Special Guests,
as described in this paragraph.

6.2. Voting Members include the following:

6.2.1 The Commander, 412th Mission Support Group (412 MSG/CC), or a designee.

6.2.2. The Commander, 412 Security Forces, or a designee.

6.2.2. The Staff Judge Advocate, 412 Test Wing, or a designee.

6.3. Non-Voting Invitees: The JIC Chairman may invite other members of the official base
community to sit on the JIC as Non-Voting Invitees if the nature of a particular case so requires.
The other members may include, but are not limited to, persons from the following
organizations:

6.3.1. Chaplain (412 TW/HC).

6.3.2. Family Advocacy (412 MDOS/SGOW).

6.4. Special Guests: The JIC Chairman may also invite Special Guests, such as the Edwards AFB
Exchange Security Manager, The Edwards AFB Commissary Security Manager, and/or a
representative from the Housing Management Office (412 CE/CEIH). Guests may also include
the sponsor’s commander and first sergeant, if deemed necessary by the JIC Chairman.

6.5. JIC Member Disqualification(s): The members of the JIC must be neutral and detached to
the maximum extent possible. Therefore, if the juvenile who is the subject of a particular JIC is
the dependent child of any member of the JIC, that member shall be disqualified from serving on
the JIC with respect to his or her child.
7. Responsibilities.

7.1. The 412 TW/CC will:

7.1.1. Determine if a matter is appropriate for JIC resolution and refer any matter so determined
to the MSG/CC for execution of a JIC consistent with this instruction. If the 412 TW/CC
determines the matter does not necessitate referral to the JIC, the 412 TW/CC may consider
issuing a warning letter to the juvenile (see Attachment 1).

7.1.2. Take any action the 412 TW/CC deems necessary based on the findings and
recommendation of the JIC. The 412 TW/CC is not limited to the recommendations of the JIC
and may take any action consistent with the authorities vested in the installation commander.

7.2. The 412 MSG/CC will:

7.2.1. Serve as the JIC Chairman in accordance with this instruction.

7.2.2. Contact the juvenile and sponsor notifying them of the date, time, and location of the
meeting with the JIC. The meeting date shall be as soon as possible, but no later than 90 days
after discovery of a juvenile’s alleged involvement in a particular incident or 90 days after the
completion of an investigation into an incident of juvenile misconduct, whichever is later.

7.2.3. Issue a notification memorandum (see Attachment 2) signed by 412 MSG/CC to the
juvenile and the juvenile’s parent(s)/sponsor(s) informing them of the allegation(s) (an
information copy will be sent to the sponsor’s unit commander).

7.2.4. Prepare a memorandum for the 412 TW/CC announcing the finding(s) and
recommendation(s) of the JIC. The memorandum shall also include information regarding
community service, counseling referrals, etc., as applicable.

7.2.5. Prepare a draft disposition memorandum implementing the recommendation(s) of the JIC
and forward to the 412 TW/CC (see Attachment 3) for review and signature. The memorandum
should be addressed to the juvenile, announce the findings of the JIC, and direct any action
deemed necessary by the 412 TW/CC.

7.2.6. Ensure the signed memorandum is given to the juvenile and his or her sponsor(s) and that
a copy is forwarded to 412 SFS and 412 TW/JA.

7.3. The 412 SFS/CC will:

7.3.1. Upon referral of an allegation of juvenile misconduct to the JIC, prepare an AF Form
3545, Incident Report, describing the alleged misconduct for all non-traffic related offenses.
Such Incident Report shall document any and all coordination with other local law enforcement
agencies who may have investigated the alleged misconduct.
7.3.2. Send the AF Form 3545 and a copy of the notification letter to 412 TW/JA and 412
MSG/CC.

7.3.3. If any of the juvenile’s privileges are likely to be revoked, 412 SFS will prepare a draft
revocation memorandum for the 412 TW/CC’s signature, addressed to the sponsor, directing the
sponsor to apply for a replacement identification card for the juvenile with limited privileges. If
the revocation order is signed and returned by the 412 TW/CC, 412 SFS will ensure that the
signed memorandum is mailed or handed to the juvenile and his or her parent(s)/sponsor(s), and
that a copy is forwarded to 412 MSG/CC and 412 TW/JA.

7.2.4. If applicable, issue to the juvenile a memorandum signed by the 412 MSG/CC that
immediately suspends the juvenile’s on-base privileges relating to the offense and serve a copy
on the juvenile and the juvenile’s parent(s)/sponsor(s). Such initial suspension shall be
addressed at the JIC, as appropriate.

7.4. The 412 TW/SJA will:

7.4.1. Be available to the Chairman to advise on legal issues as needed.

7.4.2. Bring to the JIC’s attention and resolve any issues of law that arise before, during, and
after the JIC proceedings.

7.5. The juvenile and his or her sponsor will:

7.5.4. Upon submission to the jurisdiction of the JIC, comply with all orders of the JIC and the
decision memorandum issued by 412 TW/CC. While participation in community service and
counseling programs by the juvenile and/or the sponsor is voluntary, rescission of administrative
sanctions (e.g., reinstatement of privileges) may be contingent upon the satisfactory completion
of such programs.

8. Conducting JIC meetings.

8.1. The JIC Chairman shall conduct JIC meetings.

8.2. The JIC may arrange for the appearance of any witness deemed necessary for the resolution
of the case. Formal rules of evidence do not apply. The JIC may consider information, within
its discretion, that is deemed relevant.
8.3. JIC meetings shall be closed to the public, as the information discussed is protected from
public disclosure by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a.

8.4. As a minimum, the JIC proceeding will:

8.4.1. Inform the juvenile of the allegation in person.

8.4.2. Review the evidence supporting the allegation with the juvenile.

8.4.3. Permit the juvenile to address each allegation and the evidence directly with the JIC.

8.4.4. Make relevant inquiries of the juvenile, his or her sponsor, or any witness(es).

8.5. After a review of the evidence and any statements provided by the juvenile, the Voting
Members of the JIC shall enter into a closed session and make a finding as to whether the alleged
misconduct was committed by the juvenile. Such a finding shall be determined by a majority
vote of the Voting Members after applying a preponderance of the evidence standard. This is the
standard of proof necessary to find that the juvenile committed the misconduct in question. This
standard is met when the credible evidence as a whole shows that it is more probable than not
that the juvenile engaged in misconduct.

8.6. Upon a finding that the alleged misconduct was committed by the juvenile, the JIC shall
recommend to the 412 TW/CC an appropriate response to the misconduct, including but not
limited to the following or any combination thereof:

8.6.1. No action.

8.6.2. Oral counseling, admonition, or reprimand of the juvenile and/or his or her sponsor.

8.6.11. Requirement that the juvenile complete a specified number of hours of community
service on or off Edwards AFB.

8.6.12. Recommendation of corrective action to other base agencies.

8.6.13. Any other action deemed appropriate for the preservation of good order, morale, and
discipline on Edwards AFB after consultation with a Judge Advocate from 412 TW/JA.

8.7. The JIC may require the juvenile and sponsor to attend a future JIC meeting to determine
whether the action taken was correct and sufficient and whether the juvenile is complying with
the terms and conditions.

8.8. JIC meetings are not adversarial proceedings. Neither the juvenile nor his or her sponsor has
the right to free assistance of legal counsel during the meeting. Nothing in this instruction shall
be construed to grant any additional legal rights to the juvenile or his or her sponsor.

9. Records Management. 412 SFS shall maintain the confidentiality of all records subject to
the Privacy Act of 1974 and dispose of them in accordance with AFI 33-332, The Air Force
Privacy and Civil Liberties Program. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and are disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
