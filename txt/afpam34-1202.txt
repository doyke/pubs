                          AIR FORCE PROTOCOL PROGRAM

1.1. Scope. This pamphlet provides guidance and history for excellence in protocol, decorum,
customs and courtesies during Air Force ceremonies, conferences, and social events, in hosting
distinguished visitors and in honors afforded at military funerals. MAJCOM, DRU, and FOA
commanders and the Chief, National Guard Bureau, may issue additional guides specific to their
protocol operations so long as it further supports the goals of the United States Air Force and
specific military missions.
1.2. Overview Refer to AFI 34-1201 for a full overview and a delineation of roles and
responsibilities associated with Air Force protocol

                                            Chapter 2

                                    FLAG BACKGROUND

2.1. Purpose. This chapter provides tools, background and historical information on the
display, disposition, and use of flags.
2.2. Reference. Flags are an integral part of Air Force events. AFI 34-1201 provides directive
guidance. The following information on flags is historical and informational in nature.
2.3. Overview. Flags play an important role in military ceremonies. There are very formal
rules of etiquette with regard to their use and display. The national flag of the United States of
America is the most important symbol of our nation's past and future. It is important to display it
proudly and properly. This chapter consolidates information from many sources and serves as a
reference.
2.4. U. S. and Foreign National Anthems.
     2.4.1. The U. S. National Anthem. Francis Scott Key‘s "The Star Spangled Banner"
     became the U.S. national anthem on 3 March 1931.
“THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER”
―O say! can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thro‘ the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets‘ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
gave proof thro‘ the night that our flag was still there.
O say! does that Star-Spangled Banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

 ―On the shore, dimly seen thro‘ the mist of the deep,
Where the foe‘s haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o‘er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning‘s first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream.
‗Tis the Star-Spangled Banner. 0 long may it wave
O‘er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

―And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,
That the havoc of war and the battle‘s confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash‘d out their foul footstep‘s pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,
And the Star-Spangled Banner in triumph doth wave
0‘er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                    9


―O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand
Between their lov‘d home and war‘s desolation,
Blest with vict‘ry and peace, may the Heav‘n-rescued land
Praise the pow‘r that hath made and preserv‘d us a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto, ‗In God is Our Trust.‘
And the Star-Spangled Banner in triumph shall wave
O‘er the land of the free and the home of the brave.‖
   2.4.2. Title 36 United States Code, Section 301 provides guidance on conduct during the
   playing of the national anthem. The national anthem, first verse, is the only song authorized
   for playing at Air Force ceremonies when colors are presented. ―God Bless America‖ or
   other patriotic songs will not be substituted for the nation anthem.
       2.4.2.1. ―To The Color‖ is not the national anthem; it is a bugle call that is occasionally
       played instead of the national anthem, although, it is not recommended as a replacement
       to the national anthem. During ―To The Color,‖ military members and civilians should
       render the same customs and courtesies as those given to the playing of the national
       anthem.
   2.4.3. The national anthem may be played at the beginning, middle, or end of a program, the
   choice being made according to where it will be given the greatest dignity. The anthem is
   always played with dignity. There is never applause after its rendition. The anthem is never
   "jazzed up" to compete with modern music. The anthem is never played as part of a medley.
   2.4.4. National anthems of foreign countries may be obtained from the Department of the
   Army: Anthems NCO, The United States Army Band Library, Joint Base Myer-Henderson
   Hall, VA 22211; Comm: (703) 696-3648; email: usarmy.jbmhh.mdw.list.tusab-
   library@mail.mil Anthems of foreign nations are used when rendering honors on the
   occasion of official visits of foreign heads of state, members of a royal family, and other
   visiting foreign delegations. The performance of the national anthem of any foreign country
   will be followed, without pause, by playing the national anthem of the United States. When
   two or more foreign national anthems are played, the United States national anthem is
   performed last.
2.5. Flag Burning Service. Title 4 United States Code, Chapter 1, states: "The flag, when it is
in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem of display, should be destroyed in a
dignified way, preferably by burning."
   2.5.1. In many American communities, one or more organizations, such as the Boy Scouts of
   America, Veterans of Foreign Wars, or the American Legion, render an important
   community service by collecting and overseeing the proper disposal of old, worn, tattered,
   frayed, and/or faded U.S. flags.
2.6. Flag Burning Ceremony. A formal ceremony is not required. The American Flag
Foundation (formerly The National Flag Foundation) provides a guide for conducting a patriotic
flag burning ceremony at the following website: http://americanflagfoundation.org/.
2.7. Flag Ordering for Special Ceremonies. Flags for retiring military members may be
purchased using unit O&M funds. Contact your local unit GPC approving authority. Flags may
also be obtained at cost from the honoree‘s U.S. Senator or U.S. Representative. Contact the
 10                                                        AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


appropriate congressional office for their ordering procedures. The websites listed below are
current as of the publication of this document, but are subject to change.
   2.7.1. Sources   for   flags   can    be    found    on    the    GSA                   website:
   https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advgsa/advantage/main/start_page.do.
   2.7.2. Flags that have been flown over the Capitol can be ordered from the honoree‘s U.S.
   Senator or U.S. Representative. Ordering procedures are outlined at the following website:
   http://www.capitolflags.gov/ordering/.
   2.7.3. Instructions on ordering flags flown over the Pentagon are available throught the
   Pentagon          Force       Protection      Agency        at       the        website:
   http://www.pfpa.mil/services/flagpnt.html.
2.8. Display of Flags. Correct height, positioning, straightening of staffs, and the draping of
flags all play an important role in achieving the correct display. AFI 34-1201 provides specific
guidelines on the position and manner of display of the U.S. flag. Practical tips for arranging
flags for both indoor and outdoor events are outlined below.
   2.8.1. Use the same size and type of flagstaff and base within a presentation of flags, unless
   the U.S. flag is placed at the center of a line of flags; then it must be displayed at a higher
   level than other flags in the display. When the U.S. flag is displayed with flags of other
   nations, flags should be of equal size and height.
   2.8.2. Use flags of the same material in a display—do not mix outdoor flags with indoor
   flags.
   2.8.3. Use the same size flag, except for the smaller general officer flag.
   2.8.4. Securely fasten to the flag staff to prevent sliding down the staff during the event.
   2.8.5. Finals (metal nickel-plated spades) are parallel to the audience with flat side out.
   2.8.6. Due to ceiling limitations in most rooms, flag staff height may be an issue. Avoid
   using 8-foot staffs because a full size flag will be too large and touch the floor.
   2.8.7. Flags should be draped from left to right as you look at the flag. Drape all flags the
   same way so the bottom tips are all in the same location.
   2.8.8. It is recommended that another person, knowledgeable of flag protocol, check a flag
   display to ensure accuracy.
2.9. The History of the Stars and Stripes. The story of the origin of our national flag parallels
the story of the origin of our country. As our country received its birthright from the peoples of
many lands, who were gathered on these shores to found a new nation, so did the patterns of the
Stars and Stripes rise from several origins. The history of the U.S. flag and origin of The Colors
is printed in Our Flag from the 109th Congress, 2nd session which is from the U.S. Senate
concurrent resolution 108 (S. DOC.109-18) available at the following web address:
http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CDOC-109sdoc18/pdf/CDOC-109sdoc18.pdf.
   2.9.1. The Meaning of Stars and Stripes. The flag of the United States of America has 13
   horizontal stripes, 7 red and 6 white, representing the 13 original colonies. The union, which
   consists of white stars of 5 points on a blue field, is located in the upper quarter next to the
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                    11


   staff and extending to the lower edge of the fourth red stripe from the top. The number of
   stars equals the number of States in the Union.
2.10. Origin of The Colors. From the times of the Roman legions, various standards were
carried within the military units to identify them to the on-scene commander. Over the years, the
unit standard became sacred, and it was a singular honor to carry it. The tradition held
throughout the ages, and at the beginning of the seventeenth century when armies adopted the
regimental system, someone decided to assign color (using the word in it conventional sense) to
each regiment. After 1813, the colors were carried by the Color Sergeant, a rank specifically
introduced into the British Army first, then the American, to bestow special recognition for the
NCO honored to carry the unit's identifier.
2.11. When to Use Flags. Tradition calls for flags to be displayed at all indoor and outdoor
military ceremonies. At indoor ceremonies, flags may be prepositioned or posted at the
beginning of the ceremony. At outdoor ceremonies, flags may be prepositioned, posted, or
―trooped‖ if military formations pass in review, as in the case of a parade.
   2.11.1. Flags in Receiving Lines. At formal dinners or receptions, it is customary to display
   flags either behind the head table or behind the receiving line; both locations are not
   necessary. Refer to AFI 34-1201, Chapter 2, for specific guidance on flag precedence.
   2.11.2. Table or Miniature Flags. Table flags must be arranged in accordance to the rules for
   flag precedence when using the using the U.S. flag with others in a display.
2.12. Automobile Flags. Tradition has called for automobile flags; however, they are not
currently used within the Air Force.
2.13. Air Force Boat Flags and Plates. Tradition has called for boat flags and plates; however,
they are not currently used in the Air Force. The following is provided as information for
Protocol officers operating in a joint environment.
   2.13.1. Boat flags are 2 feet 4 7/16 inches by 4 feet 6 inches, corresponding to the positional
   or individual flags of the senior government official, civilian or military, occupying the boat.
   2.13.2. Boat plates are a facsimile, less fringe, of the positional or individual flag of the
   senior government official, civilian or military, occupying the boat. Two sizes are
   authorized, 6 inches by 9 inches and 11 inches by 14 inches.
2.14. Air Force Automobile Plates. Automobile plates are authorized for use on government
owned and leased vehicles, not on privately owned vehicles. An automobile plate indicates the
official status or rank of the senior individual occupying the vehicle. The plate will be removed
or covered when the individual for whom the plate is issued is not in the vehicle. Automobile
plates are locally fabricated. Refer to AFI 34-1201, Chapter 2, for additional details on
automobile plates.
2.15. Air Force Aircraft Plates. Aircraft plates are authorized to represent the senior
government official, civilian, or military occupying the Air Force aircraft. Aircraft plates are
facsimiles, less fringe, of the positional or individual flag. Aircraft plates are 11 inches by 14
inches or smaller as required by individual aircraft. Brackets for aircraft plates are mounted
according to existing technical orders.
2.16. Automobile Flag, Plates, and Aircraft Plates for Other Than Air Force
members. Officials of other departments, comparable to Air Force officials authorized to
 12                                                       AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


display their flag or other appropriate device on other government automobiles and aircraft, are
also authorized to display their flag or appropriate device on Air Force automobiles and aircraft.
When two or more dignitaries (including Air Force members) are present, display the device
representing the senior government official, civilian, or military. For additional information,
refer to AFI 34-1201, Chapter 2.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                    13

                                           FUNDING

3.1. Introduction. There are several sources of funds for protocol-related expenses. In addition
to following published financial policy, perception must also be considered. What is technically
authorized may be perceived as improper. This chapter provides an overview of various fund
sources and references. Always refer to financial management policy when determining the
proper fund source. When in doubt, consult with the staff judge advocate and financial manager.
Remember to obtain required approval before obligating funds.
3.2. Appropriated Funds (APF). APFs are government funds from the public treasury,
appropriated by an act of Congress to conduct the business of government agencies and
activities. The appropriation for the Department of Defense (DoD), for example, provides the
primary financial support for carrying out the defense and national security missions and
activities assigned to the department and its component services. Under some circumstances,
APFs may be used for discretionary expenditures related to the mission of a command.
   3.2.1. Official Representation Funds (ORF). ORF are specifically appropriated through the
   Secretary of Defense (SecDef) to the Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF) and are intended to
   uphold the standing and prestige of the United States by extending courtesies to certain
   officials and dignitaries of the United States and foreign countries. The SecAF allocates
   ORF to the MAJCOM commanders, who further allocate a portion of these funds to
   Numbered Air Force Commanders and Wing Commanders based on annual requirements
   and availability. ORF are frequently referred to as contingency funds.
       3.2.1.1. DoDI 7250.13, Use of Appropriated Funds for Official Representation Purposes
       outlines official DoD policy concerning ORF.
       3.2.1.2. HAF Mission Directive (MD) 1-6, The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary
       of the Air Force, delineates policy for the Secretariat and the Air Force on contingency
       funds and assigns responsibility for overall management of contingency funds to the
       Administrative Assistant to the SecAF.
       3.2.1.3. AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds, implements AFPD 65-6, Budget
       Policy and DoDI 7250.13 governs use of ORF. The local protocol office is typically the
       point of contact for these funds.
   3.2.2. Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Funds. O&M Funds may be used for many
   protocol-related expenses. Coordinate with your resource advisor before obligating O&M
   funds for your function.
3.3. Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs) for Special Morale and Welfare (SM&W)
Purposes. Nonappropriated funds come primarily from the sale of goods and services to (DoD)
military and civilian personnel and their families. AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds
(NAFs), Chapter 12, defines Air Force policy concerning the request, approval, and use of NAFs
for SM&W purposes. The table in that chapter outlines the proper fund source for several types
of expenditures. MAJCOMs and installations may impose stricter requirements than those
contained in the AFI. Fundamentally, SM&W expenditures must be conservative, be in the best
interest of the Air Force, benefit the military community, and not be limited to specific grades or
 14                                                       AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


levels of personnel. The Force Support Squadron‘s resource manager is the point of contact for
these funds. MAJCOM commanders ensure the integrity of this program by personally
monitoring base-level expenditures through required quarterly reports.
3.4. When Government Funds Are Not Authorized or Available. For many events, such as
dinners and break refreshments at a conference, the proper source of funds is the individual.
   3.4.1. For conferences, workshops, and seminars, estimate the total cost to provide
   refreshments and meals. Divide the total cost by the number of attendees and charge this
   amount (normally referred to as a hospitality fee) to any attendee taking part in the
   refreshments. Remember to clearly itemize the expenses that comprise the hospitality fee.
   Inform attendees of the amount owed upon arrival or during registration and ensure to obtain
   payment up front.
   3.4.2. For dinners, factor in not only the cost of the meal, but the costs for such items as
   programs, honored guests‘ meals, and decorations; prorate these additional costs over all the
   attendees as appropriate (consider a ―sliding scale‖ to provide some relief for lower ranking
   attendees). Typically, these functions are held in an Air Force Club and you will charge pro
   rata costs to the attendees. When this is the case, work closely with the catering manager or
   club manager to ensure you understand the process and any benefits afforded to club
   members. It is important attendees are charged the proper amount and that they understand
   the true cost of the meal, including additional charges to cover other expenses.
   3.4.3. There are other occasions when government funds are not authorized or available and
   the individual is not the proper source of funds. When this is the case, private organizations,
   community support groups, or off-base businesses may, under certain circumstances, offer
   support for base functions. However, you may not solicit this support. Consult with the
   local finance and staff judge advocate offices to determine the proper way to proceed.
3.5. Appropriated Funds for Postage. APFs may be used to pay the postage for official mail
relating solely to the business of the United States Government (Reference: DoDM
4525.8_AFMAN 33-306, DoD Official Mail Manual). APFs may be used:
   3.5.1. By the Army National Guard and Air National Guard only for mailings pertaining to
   Federal Government matters.
   3.5.2. By an activity or activity commander for inviting non-DoD dignitaries to attend
   official social functions held in behalf of a DoD Component or sponsored in the name of a
   DoD Component. The official status of the function must be clearly stated or readily apparent
   in the invitation. For example, an installation commander is authorized to use APF postage to
   invite community officials to an installation open house.
   3.5.3. By retired members of a DoD Component for merchandise return or business reply
   items furnished to them by a DoD activity.
   3.5.4. For mailing change-of-address cards. (Only applies for changes-of-address resulting
   from carrying out written military orders. A copy of the orders must be presented with the
   cards.)
   3.5.5. For mailing bulk shipments of daily, weekly, housing and similar bulletins. Mailings
   must be for supported installations and activities only. Less costly methods of shipment must
   be considered and used when feasible.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                 15


  3.5.6. For official announcements of official retirement, promotion, award, change-of-
  command, and ship commissioning/decommissioning ceremonies. The location and time of
  a directly related reception may be noted if it does not result in any increase in cost to the
  Government. Notation must not include advertisement for or endorsement of any enterprise.

                                         MEMENTOS

4.1. Introduction. Presentation of mementos to official visitors and guests is a demonstration
of appreciation and in accordance with official courtesies. Refer to the Joint Ethics Regulation,
DoD 5500.7-R, AFI 34-201, AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, and AFI 65-603,
Official Representation Funds Guidance and Procedures, for policy. Consult with local
contracting, finance (APF), Force Support Squadron resource management (NAF) and staff
judge advocate offices to ensure you follow all applicable rules.
4.2. Stewardship. AFI 65-603, identifies mementos as items of little intrinsic value, such as
coins, paperweights, lapel pins, plaques, and welcome baskets/boxes. If government funds will
be expended, determine what, if any, category of funds is authorized to support the event and
what amount may be spent.
   4.2.1. Official Representation Funds (ORF). Designated DoD officials and other officials
   delegated the authority to host ORF events may present mementos funded by ORF to certain
   high-level dignitaries. The aggregate cost of mementos presented by any one DoD official to
   any one authorized guest at a DoD sponsored event may not exceed the limits established by
   law, currently $350. This amount changes from year to year. DoD organizations may also
   give mementos, not to exceed $50, to authorized DoD officials. Refer to AFI 65-603 and
   DoDD 7250.13 for specifics.
   4.2.2. Special Morale and Welfare (SM&W) Expenditures. When a memento is authorized
   as a NAF SM&W expenditure, the spending limit is $20. Refer to AFI 34-201 to determine
   whether funding is authorized for a specific purpose. In general, mementos are authorized
   for:
       4.2.2.1. Retirees
       4.2.2.2. Spouses of retirees, award winners, and promoted individuals
       4.2.2.3. Under certain circumstances, government and non-government personnel for
       civic affairs/events, memorial observances, and hosting of visiting personnel
4.3. Inventories. Separate inventories and accounts must be kept for mementos purchased with
APFs and NAFs. It is very important to keep accurate records. These records must be up to date
and reflect both where the stocked items came from and where (to whom) they went.
4.4. Sources of Mementos. Most military organizations present mementos that either contain
an organizational emblem or are representative of the local area. Two factors to consider when
selecting a source are price and reliability. Low prices are attractive but ensure the chosen
supplier(s) can deliver when required. Additionally, identify an engraver, either on or off base,
who can support short notice requirements.
   4.4.1. If available, the installation Arts and Crafts operation will likely have an assortment of
   items that best represent the installation and its mission.
   4.4.2. Search local trophy shops for plaques and engraving. These items may be purchased
   in advance, but engraved plates should be added to the memento at the latest possible
   moment in case a visitor‘s plans change and a memento is no longer needed.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                       17


   4.4.3. Additional sources for mementos include local gift shops, artists and craftsmen,
   bookstores and factory outlet stores. The search for a memento should take place well before
   it is needed for an event.
4.5. Stocking Mementos. Keeping a conservative stock of mementos on hand will ensure
maximum flexibility and avoid last-minute trips to the supplier. The size of stock will be
determined by the frequency with which mementos are presented and budget.
4.6. Presentation. Advance coordination is crucial, especially for international visitors. It is
important to inform the visitor (or representative) in advance in case the visitor wants to make a
reciprocal presentation. If a visitor is not prepared to reciprocate, determine if this will result in
any embarrassment to the visitor. If so, cancel the presentation. The reverse of this situation is
also true. If a visitor plans to make a presentation to your principal, ask if there should also be a
reciprocal presentation.
   4.6.1. For large groups, if all members are of the same relative rank, it is appropriate to
   present each with a similar memento. If one or two members are clearly of a higher rank
   than the rest of the group, it is appropriate to present them with a "higher order" memento. In
   either case, obtain leadership approval in advance.
   4.6.2. There are no strict guidelines for the actual presentation of mementos, but consider
   making the presentation when it will have the greatest impact. Some suggestions include:
       4.6.3.1. Following lunch or dinner with the most senior staff member the individual or
       group will meet. Small mementos can be pre-positioned at the table.
       4.6.3.2. At the conclusion of a briefing or presentation attended by a senior staff
       member.
       4.6.3.3. Following an office call with the commander or his/her representative.
       4.6.3.4. At the conclusion of a speech at a dinner or dining in or dining out, presented by
       the host or president of the mess.
   4.6.4. Wrapping mementos is an important but often overlooked process. Attractive
   wrapping paper, ribbons and bows, as appropriate, can make as positive an impact as the
   memento itself. The opposite also holds true. If the memento is presented in an unattractive
   package (shipping container, etc.), it may send a negative message. Do not wrap mementos
   in such a manner that they will be difficult to open. Excessive ribbon or tape can create a
   time consuming struggle that detracts from the presentation. If a visitor will be departing
   shortly after the presentation, be prepared to pack the memento for travel. Do not try to
   shortcut this process by filling the box with excessive packing material prior to the
   presentation. Include a short note or card suggesting you will mail the memento for the
   recipient if he or she desires as an alternative.
   4.6.5. Presentation/breakaway boxes make excellent wrapping. In this manner, the memento
   is secured in a box, and the lid and the box are wrapped or taped with ribbon separately. This
   permits the honoree simply to remove the lid to get to the memento. This is especially
   advantageous if the honoree must open the memento in front of a large crowd.
4.7. Honoraria. Fees for guest speakers, lecturers and panelists, when they are authorized, are
paid using APFs. Like mementos, policy exists to limit excessive fees paid to these individuals.

Refer to AFI 65-601V1, for specifics. Consult the local finance office and staff judge advocate
to identify proper procedures and limitations.
4.8. Accepting Gifts. You may encounter situations where mementos or gifts are offered to
your commander, host, or even to you as a protocol official. Generally, gifts offered due to a
person‘s official position cannot be accepted. Consult your local staff judge advocate in these
situations to avoid possible legal repercussions for you or your commander. The Joint Ethics
Regulation (JER), DoD Directive 5500.7, Standards of Conduct, contains specific guidelines that
must be followed concerning gifts, gratuities, and honoraria from outside sources. AFI 51-601,
Gifts to the Department of the Air Force, outlines restrictions governing who within the Air
Force may accept or reject gifts offered to the Department of the Air Force.

                                     TRANSPORTATION

5.1. Introduction. The two applicable sources of Air Force policy regarding transportation are
AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement, and AFI 24-301. The chapter provides a general outline for
transporting individuals for official purposes. Refer to above instructions for definitive policy.
Attachment 8, General Official Use Rules, and Attachment 9, GMV Official Use Rules for
Transportation Terminals of AFI 24-301 provide tables with specific examples of instances in
which transportation requests are both authorized and unauthorized.
5.2. Authorized Use. Government vehicle use is limited to official purposes that would further
the mission of the Air Force, not for personal reasons, personal business, personal convenience
or pleasure. The following is a partial list of authorized transportation uses. Refer to AFI 24-
301 for complete guidance.
   5.2.1. Temporary duty, under certain circumstances.
   5.2.2. Personnel officially taking part in public ceremonies, etc.
   5.2.3. To transport civilian organizations to military installations to take part in base
   activities when officially invited.
   5.2.4. Active duty personnel to or from Air Force scheduled appointments.
   5.2.5. Personnel conducting official off-base business may take government vehicles to off-
   base eating establishments, in the vicinity of the work site, when returning to base is not cost
   effective.
   5.2.6. Government Motor Vehicle (GMV) travel is authorized to transport immediate family
   members of the sponsor in situations involving a sponsor‘s combat related death.
5.3. Unauthorized Uses. The following is a partial list of unauthorized uses of GMVs in
accordance with AFI 24-301, Chapter 3, Attachment 8, and Attachment 9.
   5.3.1. Transportation to on-base dining facilities.
   5.3.2. For personal social engagements or personal business.
   5.3.3. Vehicle support to spouses at additional expense to the government when
   accompanying the member on official business.
   5.3.4. Personal or government-directed household goods moves.
   5.3.5. Event Support (icebreakers, picnics, fundraisers, etc).        (GMV support is only
   authorized for official functions.)
   5.3.6. Transportation to adult oriented establishments, establishments for eating that do not
   have the primary purpose of food service (i.e. establishments with ―Bar‖ in the name), or off-
   base entertainment or recreational facilities.
5.4. Using Good Judgment. When the above guidance does not specifically fit a request for
transportation support, use Attachments 8 (General Official Use Rules) and 9 (GMV Official
Rules for Transportation Terminals) of AFI 24-301 as guidance. When guidance does not
 20                                                       AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


specifically fit a situation, commanders must document answers to the following questions prior
to approving the use of a government motor vehicle:
   5.4.1. Is the purpose of the trip official?
   5.4.2. Does the request have the potential to create an unfavorable perception or cause public
   criticism?
   5.4.3. Will the request impact mission requirements?
   5.4.4. Is commercial or DoD-scheduled transportation available? The Air Force does not
   provide transportation that competes with commercial services.
5.5. Military Airlift. Military airlift (Mil Air) is one mode of DV transportation. Each Air
Force command has a validator that processes Mil Air requests. Requests for military
transportation are submitted via DD Form 2768, Military Air Passenger/Cargo Request.
5.6. Spouse and Dependent Travel. This includes spouse travel on military aircraft as well as
in staff cars or military buses. The sources for Air Force policy are AFI 24-101 and AFI 24-301.
Please refer to these documents for complete details.
   5.6.1. For spouses traveling as an adjunct to the sponsor on either DoD or commercial
   aircraft, travel must satisfy two criteria: 1) the travel must be an official requirement and 2)
   the spouse must actually participate in the event requiring the travel.
       5.6.1.1. DoD personnel in DV Code 2 (the Secretary of Defense, Service Secretaries,
       Principal Under Secretaries, and appropriate four-star general officers) may approve
       travel of their spouses, based on meeting the above criteria. The Air Force Senior
       Executive Management Office publishes a relative rank list with DV codes for active
       duty general officers and civilian senior executives. AF Portal link:
       https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/site/HAF/AF_A1/DPS).
       5.6.1.2. Incumbent approval for spouse travel is also authorized for certain three-star
       general officers serving in designated overseas billets.
       5.6.1.3. All other spouse travel must be approved on a case-by-case basis by the
       appropriate authority based on unit of assignment. Refer to AFI 24-101 for details.
       5.6.1.4. Both commercial and Mil Air authorization/approval must be supported with
       Invitational Travel Orders (ITOs). ITOs ordinarily authorize reimbursement of
       transportation costs only.
   5.6.2. Spouse Travel in Staff Cars. Spouses are not considered representatives of the United
   States, DoD or Air Force, except when traveling on an approved Invitational Travel
   Authorization (ITA).
       5.6.2.1. The laws that govern travel on government aircraft also apply to government
       vehicles. When spouse travel by air is appropriate, staff car support is equally valid.
       Ground transportation must be in direct support of the invitation (i.e. travel to/from
       transportation terminal, lodging, and event site.)
       5.6.2.2. A spouse officially invited to attend a function or ceremony with the military
       member is authorized travel by government vehicle. When separation of the spouse and
       member occurs during official functions, the spouse is afforded transportation.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                21


  5.6.3. Spouses authorized to travel in their own right. Sometimes spouses travel in their own
  right, as unpaid volunteers or members of boards and committees.
     5.6.3.1. In this case, ITOs are used; these can be funded (as authorized by the Joint
     Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR) or unfunded, as appropriate.
     5.6.3.2. Most TDY travel is accomplished by commercial air. The sponsoring base
     organization is responsible for the travel budget, including per diem. Funded orders are
     required for all commercial travel.
     5.6.3.3. If military aircraft is desired, an exception to policy approved by the Assistant
     Vice Chief of Staff is required.

                                 ADDRESSING ENVELOPES

6.1. Introduction. This chapter provides a guide to addressing envelopes. Additional specific
examples are included in Attachment 3.
6.2. Reference. A valuable reference for properly addressing envelopes for government
officials is Protocol, The Complete Handbook of Diplomatic, Official and Social Usage by
McCaffree, Innis, and Sand.
6.3. Guidelines. The following guidelines will help ensure envelopes are properly addressed. It
is acceptable to use labels with a font that matches the print on the invitation; place the labels
neatly on the envelope. If possible, print directly onto the envelope using a printer with an
envelope feeder.
   6.3.1. Address and mail invitations to business addresses, unless the only address available is
   residential.
   6.3.2. The words ―OFFICIAL BUSINESS‖ must follow the organizational return address.

       government expense.
       6.3.2.2. Invitations strictly for social events, e.g., retirement dinners, must be mailed at
       retiree‘s expense.
   6.3.3. Do not use abbreviations in the address except for Dr., Mr., Mrs., and Ms.

   6.3.7. Use the individual‘s full name, e.g., Major Thomas L. Radisson.
   6.3.8. If the spouse is invited, include ―and Mrs.‖ on the label. Accepted etiquette indicates
   an envelope addressed ―Major Thomas L. Radisson‖ would mean the invitation is intended
   for him only. If the spouse is invited, the envelope should read "Major and Mrs. Thomas L.
   Radisson."
   6.3.9. List the ―primary‖ invitee first on the envelope.
       6.3.9.1. The primary is the individual who merits the invitation because of their position
       or relationship to the honoree or event.

                                      PRECEDENCE

7.1. Introduction. Precedence is the right to higher honor or priority of importance at a
ceremonial or formal occasion. Determining order of precedence is the starting point for all
aspects of an official function. Refer to AFI 34-1201, Chapter 7, for guidance on precedence.

                                            Chapter 8

                               CUSTOMS AND COURTESIES

8.1. Introduction. This chapter provides a guide to the history of military customs and
courtesies, especially the roots and traditions of the Air Force. Policy concerning proper customs
and courtesies is addressed is AFI 34-1201.
8.2. Reference. The information contained in this chapter was taken from a variety of sources
including Military Customs and Traditions by Major Mark M. Boatner III, Naval Ceremonies,
Customs and Traditions by VADM William P. Mack and LCDR Royal W. Connell, USAFA
Cadet Decorum Handbook--Contrails, United States Air Force Academy and The Air Force
Basic Military Training Study Guide.
8.3. Overview. The Air Force, being the newest of the Armed Forces, draws many of its
customs, courtesies and tradition from its parent service, the U.S. Army. Since inception on 18
September 1947, the Air Force has developed customs and traditions of its own. This chapter
provides a brief outline of the customs, courtesies and traditions of the Air Force and sister
Services.
8.4. Salutes. Nothing is more embedded in the military culture than saluting. All Services
teach this in their basic officer and enlisted training programs and it is reinforced throughout the
service member's career.
   8.4.1. Origins. The exact origin of the hand salute is unknown; many references point to the
   knight's symbolic gesture of raising his visor to reveal his identity as a courtesy on the
   approach of a superior as its origin. Another possible early origin was the common practice
   of raising the right (weapon) hand as a greeting of friendship. Major Mark M. Boatner III,
   author of Military Customs and Traditions, believes the origin of the hand salute derives
   from the long established custom for juniors to remove their headgear in the presence of
   superiors. In the British Army as late as the American Revolution, a soldier saluted by
   removing his hat. As the British soldier's hat became more cumbersome, the act of removing
   the hat degenerated into a gesture of grasping the visor. The following entry in the "Order
   Book of the Coldstream Guards," dated 3 September 1745, supports this view: "The men
   ordered not to pull off their hats when they pass an officer, or to speak to them, but only to
   clap up their hands to their hats and bow as they pass." Over the years, the practice may have
   evolved into the modern hand salute.
   8.4.2. Meaning. The hand salute today, while it varies across the globe, says in effect, "I
   greet you." Returning the salute says in turn, "I return your greeting." It is rendered with
   pride as a sign of recognition and respect between comrades in the honorable profession of
   arms.
   8.4.3. Saluting on the Flight Line. Requirements for saluting on the flight line differ from
   base to base due to command and operational activity. However, members of a formal
   greeting party always salute the arrival and departure of an aircraft carrying a distinguished
   visitor (DV) and displaying the appropriate general officer or positional flag/plate. Other
   guidelines include:
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                   27


  8.4.3.1. Saluting is normally required around the base operations building, the passenger
  terminal, and similar locations.
     8.4.3.2. Saluting is not normally required in aircraft parking areas, around aircraft static
     displays, in areas designed for aircraft maintenance, or in aircraft alert hanger areas.
     8.4.3.3. Regardless of location on a flight line, if a situation appears appropriate for
     saluting, salute. It is an expected courtesy. ―When in doubt, salute.‖
  8.4.4. Saluting When with an Officer and Second Officer Approaches.
     8.4.4.1. When in the company of a senior officer and a more senior officer approaches,
     tactfully ensure the first officer is aware of the senior‘s approach. When the first officer
     salutes, salute at the same time.
     8.4.4.2. If in the company of a senior officer and a junior officer approaches, salute at the
     same time as the senior. If you outrank the approaching officer, hold your salute until the
     senior officer drops his or her salute. If the approaching officer is of higher rank than you
     are, drop your salute after the approaching officer drops his or her salute.
     8.4.4.3. If in the company of a senior officer who is unaware of a junior‘s salute, do not
     interrupt by rendering a salute to the junior.
  8.4.5. When Passing a Senior Officer from Behind. If overtaking a senior officer, slow to a
  normal pace and over take the officer on his/her left. Approach within three paces, extend a
  verbal greeting and resume pace.
  8.4.6. Exceptions to Saluting.
     8.4.6.1. Rendering a salute is not required when arms are encumbered. However, one
     should always extend a verbal greeting or respond to one in such a circumstance. (Note:
     You should always salute a senior officer if he/she is encumbered and you are not, even
     though the salute cannot be returned.)
     8.4.6.2. In the Air Force and Army, do not salute indoors except during a formal report.
     If a senior enters an office or workspace, stand to show respect for the senior.
     8.4.6.3. If saluting will interfere with official duties or is obviously impractical.
     8.4.6.4. When in the ranks of formation. If at ease in a formation, come to attention
     when addressed by a senior officer.
     8.4.6.5. When working as a member of a detail or engaged in sports or social functions.
     8.4.6.6. When one is a spectator at a sports event. If addressed by a senior, come to
     attention.
     8.4.6.7. When driving a vehicle. However, when practical, return the salutes of others.
     (This most frequently occurs when an officer driving a vehicle returns the Security
     Forces member‘s salute at the entry gate of an Air Force base.)
     8.4.6.8. When outdoors in Mess Dress, Semi-Formal, or PT gear, saluting is not required.
     However, if outside at retreat in PT gear, render appropriate salute.
  8.4.7. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2008 contained an amendment to allow
  un-uniformed service members, military retirees, and veterans to render a hand salute during
 28                                                        AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


   the hoisting, lowering, or passing of the U.S. flag. The amendment does not address saluting
   the flag during the playing of the national anthem, pledge of allegiance, honors (i.e. Taps), or
   any other saluting situations. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2009 added the
   following: Authorizing hand-salutes during the national anthem by military retirees, veterans
   and out-of-uniform military personnel.
8.5. Visiting Ships of the Navy. Customs and courtesies while visiting Marine and Naval land
installations are similar to those of the Air Force and Army. However, this changes when
visiting ships of the Navy.
   8.5.1. The ceremony of boarding a naval vessel, regardless of size, is an old and highly
   respected tradition. The custom of salutes while boarding a naval vessel is adhered to rigidly
   regardless of the high rank of the visitor.
   8.5.2. On larger naval vessels (aircraft carrier or amphibious ship), the vessel‘s top side is
   attended by side boys when visiting officers of the armed forces come onboard for or depart
   from official visits in uniform. Smaller naval vessels do not routinely provide side boys for
   official visits unless it is a formal ceremony like a change of command. Officers of the rank
   of second lieutenant to major are given two side boys and a lieutenant colonel and colonel
   four side boys. Brigadier general and major general warrant six side boys and lieutenant
   general and general warrant eight side boys. Full guard and band are also given to general
   officers. The senior officer always boards the ship first and departs last.
   8.5.3. If the visiting general's approach to the ship is by boat, the boatswain pipes when the
   boat comes alongside. He pipes again and the side boys salute when the visiting officer's
   head reaches the level of the deck.
   8.5.4. When a ship has gangways rigged on both sides, the starboard (right) gangway is
   reserved for officers and the port (left) gangway for enlisted, unless otherwise directed.
   8.5.5. Regardless of the size of the ship's complement, when reaching the deck, face the
   Colors, or aft if no Colors are hoisted, and salute. Immediately thereafter, salute the Officer
   of the Deck (OOD) regardless of rank, and say "Request permission to come aboard, sir."
   The OOD returns the salute. Normally, in the case of a visiting general officer, the captain of
   the ship and any officers of flag rank aboard will be standing near the OOD to welcome the
   visitor the moment the above ceremony has been completed. If civilian dignitaries are
   visiting a naval vessel, they should uncover when paying respect to the flag by removing
   headgear as soon as they clear the ladder or gangway and stand at attention for a brief
   moment and bow towards the Colors.
   8.5.6. The bridge is the "command post" of the ship when underway (unless in a combat
   environment), as is the quarterdeck while the ship is at anchor. It is likely the ship's captain
   will escort the general and aide immediately to the quarterdeck. When pacing the deck with
   another officer, the place of honor is outboard; and when reversing direction, each turns
   toward the other. Everyone salutes the quarterdeck when entering. The starboard side of the
   quarterdeck is reserved for the ship's captain (and admiral, if a flagship). The port side of the
   quarterdeck is reserved for commissioned officers, and the crew has all the other weather
   decks of the ship.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                      29


   8.5.7. Naval customs such as those relating to messes, calls on the captain, and permission to
   visit the bridge, are normally not applicable to a general officer. The following outlines a
   few points concerning "covered" vs. "uncovered" and other rules while aboard a Navy vessel:
       8.5.7.1. Warrants and junior officers remove caps in wardroom country.
       8.5.7.2. All officers uncover when passing through captain's or admiral's country except
       when in full dress or wearing a sword.
       8.5.7.3. All remove caps when passing through crew's quarters at meal times.
       8.5.7.4. All remove caps when entering sickbay.
       8.5.7.5. Officers do not uncover in the open except for divine worship, funerals, and
       other religious ceremonies.
       8.5.7.6. When an officer reports on board ship, he or she should call on the commander
       within 48 hours. A junior never presents his or her "compliments" to a senior; instead, he
       or she "pays his or her respects." It is courteous, but not required, to leave a calling card.
   8.5.8. On leaving the ship, the inverse order of embarking is observed. With junior officers
   first, salute the OOD and request permission to leave the ship (if a boat is used, the OOD will
   indicate when the boat is ready). Then face the Colors (or the quarterdeck), salute, and
   disembark.
   8.5.9. In the Army and Air Force, salutes are always rendered with the right hand. (Note: In
   the Air Force, left hand execution will be authorized in rare cases where a member is unable
   to use their right hand due to injury.) The Navy may use the left hand if the right is
   encumbered. Army and Air Force personnel may salute when seated or uncovered; Navy
   personnel do not.
8.6. Other Forms of Salutes. The idea of holding a weapon in a harmless position is a
universally accepted custom for showing respect.
   8.6.1. Present Arms. The movement of "Present arms" with the rifle is a token of submitting
   a weapon to the person being honored.
   8.6.2. Sword Salute. The first movement of the sword salute, bringing the hilt up opposite
   the chin, point of the sword in the air, and the second motion, lowering the point to the
   ground, symbolizes the trust of "putting down your guard."
   8.6.3. Gun Salutes. High-ranking military and civil officials may be honored by a prescribed
   number of gun blasts. In the Air Force, gun salutes are not fired during any parade, reveille
   or retreat ceremony.
8.7. Positions of Honor. The principle that the right side of a person or thing is the position of
honor is a time honor tradition. The "right of the line" was the critical side in ancient battle
formations and is the place of honor in ceremonies today.
   8.7.1. The right is also the point of honor in heraldry. The field of blue on the American flag
   is the point of honor, so the U.S. flag is always displayed with the field of stars to the flag's
   right. The one exception is a flag placed over a casket; the point of honor is to the left of the
   body, where it is more fitting the field is over the heart.
 30                                                        AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


   8.7.2. The first place of honor is always on the right. One should always afford seniors this
   position when walking, riding, or sitting with them. When joining up with a senior, always
   assume a position to his or her left.
   8.7.3. The second place of honor is that of being in front or "going first." As a junior, allow
   a senior to precede you through a doorway. If boarding an aircraft in a group, the senior
   member will enter first to select a seat, and so on. On departing the aircraft, the same rule
   applies; the most senior officer departs first.
   8.7.4. In the combination of a junior woman and a senior man, the senior man should
   precede the junior woman through the door. Unofficially, or in a "social" situation, the man
   may extend traditional courtesies and allow the woman the position of honor.
   8.7.5. Three exceptions to these rules of courtesy and conduct include:
       8.7.5.1. When an aircraft has been assigned a senior officer, all junior-ranking personnel
       board first and take their seats before the senior arrives at the aircraft. Normally, either
       the crew or the senior officer‘s executive officer/aide will ensure the proper seat is
       reserved for the senior officer. All should remain in their seats until the senior officer
       leaves the aircraft at its destination.
       8.7.5.2. When entering an auto or a small boat, the senior officer is the last to enter and
       the first to leave. The position of honor in an automobile is in the rear seat to the right of
       the driver. If the driver cannot open or close the door, the junior passenger should do so.
       See AFI 34-1201, Chapter 11, for suggestions on seating passengers by precedence in
       automobiles.
8.8. American Military Decorations. The first American decoration was developed by George
Washington in 1782 when he had the "purple heart" created. It was to be awarded for "singularly
meritorious action" and consisted of a small purple cloth heart to be worn over the left breast.
Three were awarded in 1783, but records show no others since then.
   8.8.1. Medal of Honor. In December of 1861, Senator James W. Grimes of Iowa introduced
   a bill that resulted in the establishment of a Medal of Honor for Navy enlisted men. This is
   the first decoration formally authorized by the American government to be worn as a badge
   of honor. The Army followed suit in 1862, and officers were declared eligible for the medal
   in 1863. The following guidelines on saluting and arrangement of recipients are presented
   from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society‘s ―Medal of Honor Recipients General
   Protocol and Information‖ document.
       8.8.1.1. Salute. There is no law or military regulation requiring personnel of any rank to
       salute a Medal of Honor recipient. However, it is permissible to salute a recipient as a
       display of respect or honor, whether he or she is civilian or retired military, when he or
       she is physically wearing the medal.
       8.8.1.2. Arrangement of Recipients. When more than one Medal of Honor recipient is to
       be present at an event, the Congressional Medal of Honor Society and the recipients
       themselves request they not be arranged by rank. Recommended options of order are
       alphabetically, by war, by action date, by birthplace, by state, by age, or by height if in a
       parade or on a raised platform.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                     31


   8.8.2. Additional Medal of Honor facts and information about recipients are available at the
   Congressional Medal of Honor Society‘s web page at: http://www.cmohs.org/.
8.9. Other Official Customs of the Service.
   8.9.1. RHIP (Rank Hath Its Privileges). RHIP refers specifically to those special courtesies
   that persons of junior rank or status extend to their "seniors." Extending a verbal courtesy
   (such as "sir") or physical courtesy (such as a salute) to a senior acknowledges a privilege the
   senior has earned and expects. It is also an acknowledgment of authority and respect. Rank
   also has its obligations, which includes ensuring subordinates' rights are respected.
   8.9.2. Calling a Room to Attention. By enlisted custom, the first person to see an officer
   entering the room calls the room to attention. If an officer of equal or higher rank is already
   in the room, the room is not called to attention. When the officer departs, the room is called
   to attention again.
       8.9.2.1. It is not traditional for officers to follow this practice. When junior officers are
       gathered in a room awaiting the arrival of a senior officer, post an individual to watch for
       his or her arrival. As the senior officer approaches, the watcher may sound off, ―stand
       by‖ or ―at ease,‖ as a warning. When the senior enters the room, one officer will
       announce, ―Ladies and gentlemen, the commander,‖ or ―Ladies and Gentlemen, General
       Jones.‖ All officers stand at attention until told to be seated. It is a common courtesy for
       all individuals in a room or area to stand when a senior civilian enters.
       8.9.2.2. Brining a room to attention should be avoided if doing so will create a safety
       hazard or negatively affect the mission.
   8.9.3. By Direction of the President. Only "by direction of the President" can an officer be
   required to serve as a subordinate to one whom he or she ranks. Orders assigning any officer
   to a position of command over an officer senior to him/her will include the phrase "by
   direction of the President."
   8.9.4. Addressing Junior Officers. In the Army and Air Force, only academy cadets and
   warrant officers are addressed as "Mister/Miss/Ms."; all other officers are addressed by their
   rank. The Navy follows old traditions and avoids addressing officers below the rank of
   Commander by title. When speaking to naval officers below the rank of Commander,
   enlisted use "Mister/Miss."
   8.9.5. Courtesy Visits/Calls. When visiting any military organization or Navy ship, it is
   customary to pay a courtesy call to the commanding officer. On an Army installation, the
   first call should be to the commanding officer, even if the visitor ranks him or her. When
   reporting in on a Navy vessel, report to the ship's captain within 48 hours of arriving.
       8.9.5.1. When making new contacts in either an official or a social capacity, it may be
       appropriate to offer business cards, if available. Present the card face up while making
       good eye contact. When receiving a card, give the presenter of the card the courtesy of
       reading it before putting it away.
8.10. Service Semantics. When scheduled to visit a Navy ship or Army post take the time to
learn Service specific semantics.
   8.10.1. Flags are only flown at "half-mast" on board ships or on naval installations. In the
   Army and Air Force, flags are flown at ''half-staff."

  8.10.2. In the Army, only women and midshipmen wear "pants." Men wear trousers.
  8.10.3. Navy and Marine Corps Terminology for Navigating Aboard Ship. "Decks" are
  floors, "ladders" are stairways, "starboard" is right, "port" is left, "aft" is rear, "below" is
  downstairs, "forward" is towards the front, and "head" is the bathroom.

                                      FORMS OF DRESS

9.1. Introduction. One of the duties of a protocol officer it to recommend to the host or hostess
the appropriate attire for events. Sensitivity to surroundings applies to dress as well as behavior.
Dressing appropriately for the culture or occasion is crucial in ensuring a successful event; attire
worn demonstrates respect and appreciation for others.         When considering the attire for an
event, terms like ―casual‖ and ―informal‖ have become ambiguous over the years. To ensure
event participants and guests are appropriately dressed, clearly define dress requirements in
advance. Avoid the use of terms such as ―smart casual‖ or ―black tie optional‖ when identifying
dress requirements because they are confusing to a guest as to what the host/hostess expects.
Attachment 4 includes a Table of Service Equivalent uniforms and civilian attire.
9.2. Formal Attire.
   9.2.1. Historically, ―Formal‖ refers to ―White Tie‖ and ―Semiformal‖ refers to ―Black Tie‖.
   White Tie is the most formal style of dress and suggests ―tails‖- a long black tailcoat with
   matching trousers, white wing-collared shirt, white bow tie, and white pique waistcoat. For
   the ladies, appropriate dress would be a full-skirted grand ball gown and long white gloves.
   ―Black Tie‖ includes a tuxedo for men and a long evening dress (or equivalent dress pants
   suit) or formal cocktail dress for women.
   9.2.2. In the Air Force, this is the Mess Dress/Semi-Formal Uniform and is appropriate attire
   for functions such as dinings in, dinings out, formal receptions, military weddings (if a
   participant), and civilian or corporate "black tie" events. For certain official formal evening
   functions and state occasions, identified as ―white tie affairs,‖ Air Force officers wear the
   Mess Dress with a white bow tie.
9.3. Business Suit A business suit is typically cut from the same fabric cloth for both the pants
and jacket or skirt and jacket; for men, a tie is worn with it. The material and color is dependent
on the time of year, weather, and type of event. The military counterpart to "business suit" is
Service Dress for Air Force and its equivalent for the other services. The Service Dress uniform
is appropriate for events, which include ceremonies, parades, reviews, official visits of civilian
dignitaries, changes of command, and receptions.
9.4. Business Casual. Business Casual dress implies comfortably unrestricted attire while still
appropriate for business and offers broad possibilities for dress. Invitations for the military
equivalent to business casual dress will state the uniform, which in most cases will be the
"uniform of the day (UOD)." If uniformity of dress is not important, specifying UOD for Air
Force functions is acceptable. For example, UOD is appropriate for members attending a
function such as a commander's call (principals or personnel receiving recognition may wear
Service Dress). If it is important that everyone be in the same uniform, be specific, e.g. "Long-
sleeve blue shirt w/tie."
   9.4.1. For civilian guests equivalent appropriate attire includes coat and tie (not a suit),
   slacks and sport coat, open collar for men and dress/skirt/slacks and blouse or sweater for
   women. Expect most community dignitaries and civilian guests to arrive in sports coat and
   tie or business suit unless advised otherwise. To avoid confusion and ensure guests arrive in
   the same type of attire, the level of dress should be specified in the invitation, for example
 34                                                      AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


   ―Coat and Tie, or Sports Coat w/Open Collar etc.‖ Civilian Business Casual standards will
   vary depending on geographic location. For example, Business Casual in Washington D.C.
   (coat and tie or sport coat with or without tie) will be different from Honolulu, HI (Aloha
   shirt and slacks) or Fort Walton Beach, FL (slacks and golf shirt). If unsure of what to wear,
   it is always best to ask.
9.5. Casual Attire. It is important to note that Business Casual is different from casual attire.
Casual attire is typically worn for more relaxed or outdoor events and is not as ‗dressy‘ as
Business Casual. Dress for men may include jeans with a short or long-sleeved open-neck shirt,
a sweater or sports coat, but no tie. Dress for women may include skirts, pants with blouse,
sweater or casual dress. While termed ―casual,‖ it is important to keep in mind that the form of
dress must be appropriate for duty related events.
9.6. Sports Attire. Many business functions revolve around a sporting event.            Wear the
appropriate sports attire given the event, weather and time of year. Avoid attire that shows too
much skin (for either males or females) as well as clothing and shoes with offensive logos or
pictures.
9.7. Dress for Retired Members.
   9.7.1. Retired members may wear the appropriate uniform to social and official events as
   prescribed in AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel.
   9.7.2. Wearing of authorized miniature medals on civilian business suit/formal wear is
   authorized as prescribed in AFI 36-2903.
9.8. Dress for Protocol Officers and Staff
   9.8.1. When working an event, protocol officers or staff typically dress in accordance with
   the level of dress specified by host/hostess in the invitation.
   9.8.2. On occasion, protocol officers or staff my need to wear appropriate clothing for setup
   of an event and tear down at the conclusion. Use good judgment as a representative of the
   host/hostess.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                        35

                                      ADMINISTRATION

10.1. Types of Invitations. There are different types of invitations, from a formal engraved
invitation to an informal phone call.
   10.1.1. Formal invitations can be printed or handwritten. Printed invitations are the most
   common and can be used for ceremonies, dinners, etc. They can be printed on card stock or
   letterhead.
   10.1.2. Handwritten invitations are written in black or blue ink on card stock or notepaper
   with organizational emblem or the commander‘s flag. The semi-printed invitation should not
   have the required information typed in; it should be handwritten.
   10.1.3. Letter invitations are effective when there is more than one function included, e.g.,
   an icebreaker the first night, a reception and dinner the next night, and a ceremony the third
   day.
   10.1.4. Options for e-mail invitations include cutting and pasting the actual invitation onto
   the e-mail or providing the event information in the body of the e-mail. E-invitations can
   also be created through the Air Force Institute of Technology‘s (AFIT) E-Invitations website
   at https://einvitations.afit.edu/generator/index.cfm.
   10.1.5. Telephone invitations are acceptable, but should be followed up with a "To remind"
   written invitation. When issuing a telephone invitation, do not put the invitee on the spot
   with a question like "Is Colonel Jones free Thursday night?" Instead, begin with "General
   Command is having a dinner Thursday night at his quarters. Is Colonel Jones available?"
   Telephone invitations are useful in "blocking" schedules for planning purposes well in
   advance of functions for officials with busy schedules.
10.2. Elements of an Invitation (Figure 10.1.).
   10.2.1. Command emblem or commander‘s flag. An invitation will normally have the host‘s
   organizational emblem, star flag, or other symbol at the top. The emblem should be
   centered; if there are two hosts, the senior host‘s emblem should be on the left. The emblem
   can be printed along with the invitation or preprinted on the stationary.
   10.2.2. Host. The invitation always begins with the host's title or full name or both. With
   more than one host, include all of the names. If the function is located at one of the host's
   quarters, that name should go first, or if it is at the club or a restaurant, the name of the senior
   host goes first. If side-by-side, the senior host's name goes to the left.
   10.2.3. Event. Phrasing of the invitation and event. Generic events (such as the words
   lunch, dinner, reception) are not capitalized within the invitation. Special events such as
   Change of Command or Air Force Ball should be capitalized. Several ways to phrase the
   invitation include:
       10.2.3.1. …request(s) the pleasure of your company
       10.2.3.2. …request(s) the honor of your presence
       10.2.3.3. …cordially invite(s) you to

  10.2.4. Date and Time. The date must be spelled out as follows: ―on Thursday, the thirty-
  first of January.‖ The time may be spelled out in several ways: ―at half past seven o‘clock,‖
  ―at seven thirty o‘clock,‖ or ―from seven thirty to nine o‘clock‖ (if the event warrants an end
  time). If there is a question as to whether the function is in the morning or evening, consider
  stating "half past seven o'clock in the evening."
  10.2.5. Location. Provide specific location such as room, building, and base or city.
  10.2.6. R.s.v.p. Place R.s.v.p. date and information in the bottom left-hand corner.
  Response may include the following: phone number, e-mail address, web site, or R.s.v.p.
  mail back card/sheet. When using a phone number and invitations are going off base to other
  military installations or civilian locations, use both the commercial and DSN numbers.
  Phrases such as "Regrets Only" or "Acceptances Only" can be confusing and are not
  recommended.
  10.2.7. Dress. Be specific with uniform and civilian dress requirements (see Chapter 9).
  10.2.8. Other. Additional information can be included below the dress information, e.g.,
  ―Cost per person: $15.00‖; ―No-host cocktails‖; ―Pay-as-you-go bar‖. Information such as
  "Reception follows immediately after the ceremony‖ (state if in another location) is normally
  centered at the bottom of the invitation.

Figure 10.1. Invitation Example




10.3. Preparing Invitations.
   10.3.1. First, meet with the commander or a knowledgeable representative to obtain
   necessary details for a proposed invitation list: what type of function, when, where, who is to
   be invited, what is the preferred dress. A sample invitation and proposed guest list is
   recommended.
   10.3.2. In coordination with the appropriate offices, develop a guest list suitable to the event.
   Consider inviting local city, county, and state officials; chamber of commerce officials and
   members of organizations that are supportive to the military. If there are other military
   organizations in the local area, consider including their commanders and key people. Be
   aware that some guest lists may have to meet specific ratios of DOD to non-DOD (see
   Chapter 3, and AFI 65-603, Chapter 3).
   10.3.3. Depending on the type of function, decide what inserts to include.

       10.3.3.2. Self-addressed envelope
       10.3.3.3. Menu selection card
       10.3.3.4. DV pass (allowing civilians access to the base or building)
       10.3.3.5. DV parking pass (can be the same as the DV pass if you choose)
       10.3.3.6. Map (either on back of DV pass or on separate sheet)
       10.3.3.7. Reception invitation card
       10.3.3.8. Pre-ceremony reception invitation card
       10.3.3.9. Special instructions card (bus boarding instructions, inclement weather plan)
       10.3.3.10. Seating card
   10.3.4. If required, submit everything (invitations, all inserts, and proposed invitation list) in
   a package to the host for approval.
   10.3.5. If it is a short-notice invitation with only a few invited (i.e. a dinner at the
   commander's quarters), begin by calling all of the invitees to check availability. This
   provides an opportunity to pencil the function in on a calendar and avoids sending an
   unnecessary invitation if an invitee is not available. Follow up the phone call with a "To
   remind" invitation.
10.4. Addressing Envelopes (see Chapter 6).
10.5. Mailing/Distributing Invitations.
   10.5.1. Send invitations out three to four weeks in advance for official functions,
   ceremonies, large dinners, etc.
   10.5.2. "Hold the date" or "mark your calendar" cards can be used for functions with an
   identified date, but for which additional details are pending. These can be sent out as much
   as six months in advance so invitees can block their calendars and make tentative travel/hotel
   arrangements.
10.6. R. s.v.p. Worksheet.
   10.6.1. Have the R.s.v.p. worksheet ready as soon as invitations are mailed in case one
   receives an R.s.v.p. the same day.
   10.6.2. The R.s.v.p. worksheet should be in alphabetical order with columns for all
   necessary information; yes, no, how many, menu selection, method of payment, telephone
   number, special seating requirements, name of caller, social first names for name tags (clarify
   spelling of the first name of the guest/spouse), etc.
10.7. R. s.v.p. Responses.
   10.7.1. If an invitee does not respond by the R.s.v.p. date, follow-up with a phone call or e-
   mail their office for a response.
   10.7.2. If attendance numbers are significantly different than originally planned, notify the
   club, caterer, or restaurant with an update. Each caterer will have a different attendance
   guarantee date.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                       39


10.8. Postponing and Recalling Invitations. If possible, send out a written explanation of
postponement/cancellation of a function. If time does not permit, notify invitees by telephone.
10.9. Name Tags. Tailor name tags to the event; they can include rank, go-by name, first name,
last name, and duty title. Ensure the nametag is easily readable from a distance. The name is the
most important feature of a nametag. Do not let logos and emblems dominate the tag. Nametags
can be helpful in accounting for attendance if special funding has been authorized for an event.
Arrange nametags alphabetically on tables close to the entrance. Protocol staff members should
be at tables to assist guests with nametags. Nametags should be worn on the right side of the
body to facilitate line of sight while shaking hands with other guests.
10.10. Table Seating and Arrangements. Seating is an important aspect in the success of an
event (see Chapter 15).
10.11. Place Cards. Place cards are useful at formal and informal occasions to facilitate
seating. As a rule, cards are made from white or cream-colored card stock and are approximately
1½ by 3 inches (cards either are folded and free standing or placed in a holder). Traditionally,
the flag of a general or admiral or the unit crest is embossed or printed on the card. Names are
either printed or written on the cards in black or dark blue ink. Cards are addressed with title or
rank and last name only.
   10.11.1. "Brigadier General John D. Doe" is written as "General Doe"
   10.11.2. "Lieutenant Colonel Susan R. Smith" is written as "Colonel Smith"
   10.11.3. "Mrs. Gloria C. Smith" is written "Mrs. Smith"
   10.11.4. ―TSgt Robert Jones‖ is written ―Sergeant Jones‖
   10.11.5. ―CMSgt Mary Smith‖ is written ―Chief Smith‖
   10.11.6. "Rear Admiral Harry M. Jones" is written as "Rear Admiral Jones"
   10.11.7. Note that the Navy does not truncate the rank.
   10.11.8. If more than one person with the same rank and last name is present, add their first
   initial to avoid any confusion.
   10.11.9. Which card to use is determined by who is hosting the event or personal preference.
   If a flag officer (general or admiral) is hosting, use a card that corresponds to their rank (1, 2,
   3, or 4 stars) regardless of whether a more senior officer is attending. If the host is not a
   general officer, use a card with the unit crest. When the spouse of a general/flag officer hosts
   a function where the military member is not present, do not use "star" place cards. It may be
   the host‘s preference to place go-by names on the reverse side of place cards. Placement of
   the cards will vary depending upon the table setting but are typically centered above the
   plate.
10.12. Seating Designators. To expedite the seating of guests at a large function, it is helpful to
number the tables and create a ―you-are-seated-at‖ (YASA) board, YASA cards, or seating chart.
Prominently display table numbers on all tables. Keep the table numbers in place until all guests
are seated (staff may then remove them). To facilitate seating, two lists are recommended at the
check in table, one alphabetical and one by table.
 40                                                        AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


   10.12.1. You-Are-Seated-At (YASA) Cards. At a large dinner when there is assigned
   seating, present guests with YASA cards as they arrive. A seating chart may also be
   displayed showing the location of the tables. When labeling YASA cards, use the
   ―conversational‖ rank versus the formal rank, i.e., ―Lieutenant General Hamilton,‖ would be
   displayed as ―General Hamilton‖ on the YASA card (with the exception of USN attendees,
   whose rank is always spelled out, i.e., Vice Admiral Smith versus Admiral Smith).
   10.12.2. YASA Boards.
       10.12.2.1. Display the YASA board(s) in a central location or multiple locations around
       the room but consider the impact of congestion as people crowd around the board to
       identify seats.
       10.12.2.2. One type of YASA board has an alphabetical list of all guests with table
       number beside their name and a diagram of the table layout to provide an orientation to
       the room. The YASA board or boards should be large enough to display the names of all
       guests with corresponding table number.
   10.12.3. Seating Charts. For smaller events, utilize a seating chart with table diagram and
   names of guests at each table; it may be displayed outside the dining room.
10.13. Table Settings. Table settings are usually the concern of the establishment (the club or
restaurant) where a luncheon or dinner is to be held. There are occasions when protocol staff
may need to provide assistance in this area. Consult etiquette reference texts for a detailed
explanation of the appropriate table setting to use for various types of functions. The following
general information should cover most situations:
   10.13.1. Avoid overcrowding.
   10.13.2. Place silverware on the table in the order of its use, starting from the outside and
   working toward the plate.
   10.13.3. The silverware, napkin, and plate are lined-up approximately one inch from the
   edge of the table.
   10.13.4. Place forks at the left of the plate.
   10.13.5. Place knives and spoons at the right of the plate with the blade of the knife facing
   toward the plate.
   10.13.6. An iced beverage spoon may be placed on the table to the right of the soup spoon or
   may be laid above the plate with handle to the right.
   10.13.7. The individual butter knife is usually placed across the top of the butter plate
   parallel with the edge of the table.
   10.13.8. Place a water glass (if utilized) slightly above the tip of the knife nearest the plate
   and in front of the wine glasses. Fill it two-thirds full before guests are seated.
   10.13.9. Pour wine at the appropriate time during the meal (if toasts are to be proposed right
   after the invocation, ensure wine glasses are "charged" before guests take their seats).
10.14. Menu Cards. Menu cards are occasionally used at formal events. As a rule, cards are
made from white or cream-colored heavy card stock and are printed with black ink with the flag
of a general or admiral, an organizational crest, or other graphic printed at the top of the card or
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                              41


on the cover. Menu cards can stand above the plate or be laid elsewhere at the setting. Menu
cards serve multiple purposes; they may be used to describe the menu available for the event,
they can discriminate between multiple menu options or they may be used to pay tribute to a
guest of honor. Cards may be written in calligraphy, handwritten, printed, or produced on a
computer. List only the main courses and wines being served, not the rolls and butter, celery
tray, chocolates, ice water, salt and pepper, etc.
10.15. Food Cards. Food cards can be used at a buffet to describe the item and helpful for
guests with food allergies or dietary restrictions.

                                          Chapter 12

                            DISTINGUISHED VISITORS (DVS)

12.1. Introduction. Compliance associated with distinguished visitors (DVs) is addressed in
AFI 34-1201, Chapter 12. This chapter provides a guide to preparing for, executing and
documenting DV visits.
12.2. Initial Notification of a Visit. Notification of a DV visit can take several forms and be
either formal or informal in nature. Frequently, it will be in the form of a telephone call or
written correspondence. The key to obtaining accurate information consistently, regardless of
the form of notification, is to have a list of questions readily available. Examples of DV visit
notifications include: visitor's office contacts Protocol, commander receives a note or telephone
call, directorate receives a note or telephone call, lodging requests from individuals or higher
headquarters message. The next several paragraphs provide suggestions as a template for a
successful DV visit.
   12.2.1. A successful visit requires the following information: arrival and departure times,
   purpose of visit, number in party, communications requirements, lodging arrangements,
   transportation requirements, office calls, briefings (classified or unclassified), social
   functions, entertainment, tours, meals (including dietary or customs restrictions), honor
   cordon or guard, mementos, photography, publicity or security level, and biographies.
   12.2.2. If the DVs are international dignitaries, other considerations include interpreters,
   greeting, visiting, eating, and gestures. Obtain as much information as feasible upon initial
   notification. After obtaining initial information, notify all agencies involved in the visit.
   Communication is paramount to the success of any DV visit, and continues throughout the
   visit process.
12.3. Planning.
   12.3.1. Develop a detailed protocol working plan containing information needed to execute
   the visit to include a contingency plan. This is not the itinerary provided to a DV, but rather
   a worksheet with notes and points of contact for reference.
   12.3.2. Establish a checklist for planning the DV visit. Although no two visits are exactly
   alike, many of the steps in the planning process remain basically the same for each visit.
   12.3.3. The planning task requires an understanding of the major steps in the process as well
   as the details. The following is one approach to breaking down the planning phase into its
   major steps, and accomplish details.
   12.3.4. Identify "long-lead" items and actions. Upon notification of the visit, confirm the
   availability of the commander or host; conflicts may require suggested alternative dates for
   the visit. Tentatively reserve quarters, club or dining facilities, transportation, honor guard,
   and entertainment; cancel or reschedule later as needed. Determine the purpose of the visit in
   order to identify appropriate site visits and briefings. Specific actions to consider:
       12.3.4.1. Prepare a checklist when planning all visits.
       12.3.4.2. Arrange lodging accommodations.
44                                                       AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


     12.3.4.3. Contact the DV's office to determine purpose of the visit and DV's
     expectations. (This is an opportune time to get other details, like numbers and names of
     those accompanying the DV and dietary restrictions, etc.)
     12.3.4.4. Obtain commander‘s/host's approval for the visit.
  12.3.5. Determine Roles and Responsibilities for the Visit. The protocol officer, in most
  cases, will advise on and/or oversee the visit. For larger functions or visits, the commander
  may appoint a directorate or unit as the overall office of primary responsibility (OPR) for the
  function, with the protocol officer providing support to project and escort officers.
  Communication between all involved and a clear delineation of responsibilities are both keys
  to a successful visit.
  12.3.6. Develop a "Strawman" Itinerary. Work with the action officer to outline specific
  briefings and tours required for a productive visit. Seek early input from the commander or
  host for the visit. Sequence the events in a logical manner--begin with command and
  specialized briefings before site visits for a better understanding. Block out rough times to
  include questions and answers during briefings and transportation between activities.
  Consider comfort breaks. Include time for meals, and at the end of the day, adequate time for
  rest and relaxation or exercise before beginning evening functions. Factor in the DV's "body
  clock" and amount of traveling already done. Itineraries take many forms. The key to
  making a useful document is in answering the basic questions of who, what, where, when,
  how and the proper dress code for each event. Place oneself in the DV's shoes and review
  the itinerary from that perspective. The use of notes placed in appropriate locations within
  the itinerary will help to reduce questions asked throughout the visit. At a minimum, the
  itinerary format identifies the date, time, activity, and location, as well as those DVs
  participating and what to wear. The itinerary should flow logically from one event or date to
  the next. Too much detail in the itinerary may result in the DV watching the clock rather
  than enjoying the events they are participating in. Consider the physical size and print of the
  itinerary. If the DV‘s activities require a significant amount of movement or being, consider
  making the itinerary pocket size. If the DV is elderly, consider larger type or bolder font.
  Consider the following when presenting the strawman itinerary to the commander or host:
     12.3.6.1. Notifying organizations in the command responsible for operations of
     particular interest to the DV.
     12.3.6.2. Identifying specific technical discussions and/or briefings the DV will receive,
     and block times (OPR).
     12.3.6.3. Making preliminary arrangements for meals.
     12.3.6.4. Blocking times for each activity. Providing sufficient time not only for
     meetings, office calls, meals, etc., but also for changes of clothes, coffee or tea breaks,
     occasional rest periods, and transportation.
     12.3.6.5. Will spouse accompany? If requested, plan a separate itinerary. The same
     planning factors apply.
     12.3.6.6. Planning an evening meal (or formal luncheon if required). If not already
     accomplished, tentatively reserve the facility and any entertainment. Identify invitation
     requirements and develop a suggested invitation list.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                     45


     12.3.6.7. Determine who pays for various functions and how payment will be made.
     DVs in per diem status normally pay for all their expenses; the accompanying aide or
     escort will pay the DV's bill. However, there are situations where some expenses may be
     paid from official sources.
     12.3.6.8. Getting the commander or host's approval for the strawman itinerary.
  12.3.7. Flesh out the Itinerary. Once your strawman itinerary is approved, begin adding
  detail. Start with the DV's arrival (how will the DV arrive, who is greeting, where is the first
  stop, how will the DV get there, who is accompanying, who takes care of luggage, who
  greets at the next stop). Continue through to the completion of the visit (departure time,
  departure point, transportation, who will accompany the DV, farewell attendance, and
  luggage transportation) and everything in between. The following planning factors address
  generic events; modify to fit specific needs:
     12.3.7.1. Briefings. Schedule the briefing or conference room as appropriate, determine
     attendees (key staff, host, visitors, knowledgeable staff officers, etc.), line up briefers and
     conduct dry run briefings (preferably with the commander or host present) and develop
     seating charts and table tents/cards. Determine audio-visual requirements as soon as
     possible and plan for writing materials at the table. Consider refreshments; plan on water
     at the table as a minimum.
     12.3.7.2. Office Calls. As a minimum, schedule an office call immediately upon visit
     notification (15-20 minutes usually suffices) with the commander as a courtesy. Be
     prepared to provide the commander information on the DV, purpose of the visit, and
     other relevant data. Consider others as appropriate (major directorates, etc. (Note:
     Traditionally, with an office call, the visitor is senior to the host. In a courtesy call, the
     visitor is of lower rank than the person he or she is visiting).
     12.3.7.3. Tour/Site Visits. There are the "showplaces" that reflect an organization and
     the pride of the unit. They may be mission or support agency related (the new Child
     Development Center or Airmen's dormitory). When setting up tours, consider the
     following: arranging for the commander or representative to greet and escort the DV
     through the facility; meeting necessary security requirements; making sure the facility
     and its surroundings are clean and presentable; and most importantly, dry-run the tour.
     Most problems with site visits occur because of poor time management. Allow time for
     visits to work centers and small talk with personnel at those centers. Personnel will be
     tempted to "overdo" it. Be ready for events to last longer than programmed and plan
     accordingly—the protocol officer should keep the visit on schedule.
     12.3.7.4. Meals (Breakfast and Lunch). Some DVs do not eat breakfast, but will expect
     pastries or coffee in their quarters while others will want a full breakfast to start the day.
     If appropriate, plan a breakfast (or lunch) with a group (i.e. junior officers or airmen).
     The officers' and enlisted clubs and Airmen dining facility are recommended settings. In
     a time-constrained itinerary, if traveling from one facility or site to another, consider
     stopping for lunch on the way to the next visit. A ―working lunch" is practical during
     briefings or discussions (especially if pressed for time); arrange for prepared sandwiches
     or have lunch catered. As appropriate, consider a more formal setting at the club, with
     the host and others attending.
46                                                        AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


     12.3.7.5. Dinner Plans. Allow enough time between the end of the business day and the
     start of dinner for the DV to relax, unpack, exercise, shower, etc. Normally, plan for an
     hour and a half; never less than 45 minutes unless pre-coordinated with the DV.
     Consider the DV's desires (food preference, purpose of visit, level of formality, etc.). He
     or she may prefer a quiet evening at leisure. In such cases, arrange transportation and
     provide a list of local restaurants; offer to make reservations. The purpose or type of visit
     may dictate more involved arrangements, ranging from setting up an informal dinner at
     the club or local restaurant, to a formal reception and dinner with local dignitaries and
     senior officers attending.
  12.3.8. Other Miscellaneous Tasks.
     12.3.8.1. Arrange honors and ceremonies.
     12.3.8.2. Ensure all arrangements, including reservations for hotels and restaurants,
     transportation, luggage detail, photographic support, conference room support, etc., are in
     writing.
     12.3.8.3. Ensure that dignitaries will be met and bid farewell by officers of
     commensurate rank, whenever possible. As a rule, a general or flag officer should be
     present at the arrival and departure of a general or flag officer on an official visit, unless
     there are no general or flag officers assigned to the installation. In this case, the
     installation commander or vice commander should be present.
     12.3.8.4. Coordinate Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture arrangements when DVs
     are flying in directly from an overseas location.
     12.3.8.5. Arrange public affairs support, if required (press conference, photo
     opportunities).
     12.3.8.6. Maintain a contact list of organizations and personnel that need to be notified
     (and update, as required) of itinerary changes.
     12.3.8.7. Confirm security clearances are on file with offices to be visited. Confirm
     access to controlled/restricted areas before the DV's arrival (OPR). DV may require
     storage of classified material.
     12.3.8.8. Establish uniform/dress requirements for all events and document in the
     itinerary.
     12.3.8.9. Keep the DV's office/escort officer apprised of any changes to the itinerary.
     Notify the DV's office/escort officer beforehand of any toasts to be offered at social
     functions (and his or her appropriate response) proposed speaking opportunities or press
     coverage, etc.
     12.3.8.10. The final action is to obtain the commander or host's approval of the
     completed itinerary. Once the final itinerary is approved, minimize changes.
  12.3.9. Coordinating the Details. Once the itinerary is approved, follow up on the details for
  successful execution. First, confirm the transportation, club, lodging, and security
  arrangements made initially. Provide all agencies involved with copies of the itinerary and
  understand the role they play in the visit. Briefed all escort offices on their responsibilities.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                    47


  If needed, prepare invitations, place cards, nametags, placards, etc. before the visit starts.
  Consider what might go wrong and plan for it. Other details include:
     12.3.9.1. Ensure all drivers of the official party are briefed in regards to schedules, routes
     and uniform requirements, and are given explicit directions. Drivers should be able to
     operate independently if separated from the other vehicles in the official party.
     12.3.9.2. Prepare a package that contains at least a map of the area, the local itinerary
     and lists of room assignments and telephone numbers for presentation to each member of
     the visiting party.
     12.3.9.3. Secure information booklets and other printed information.
     12.3.9.4. Reconfirm with the club or restaurant on the composition of the visiting party,
     accommodations, time and date of arrival, and method of payment.
     12.3.9.5. Continue to provide changes and updates to the DV's office or escort.
     12.3.9.6. Determine any special requirements upon the DV's departure from the
     installation (i.e., flight lunches, notifications passed to next stop, etc.)
     12.3.9.7. Conduct a final dry-run of the visit from beginning to end where practicable.
     As a minimum, run through checklists to ensure transportation, lodging, entertainment,
     etc., are addressed. If time permits, conduct dry-run briefings and tours again, especially
     if there were concerns during the first dry-run. This walkthrough will identify where the
     weak points are and can be critical to the success of the visit.
     12.3.9.8. Make any last-minute minor changes to the itinerary. Include a list of all
     visitors, with full names, nicknames, duty titles, grades, clearances, and organizations.
     12.3.9.9. Check the quarters in advance of the DV's arrival to allow housekeeping time
     to correct any deficiencies.
     12.3.9.10. Brief the commander or host on any last-minute changes. Make sure he or she
     does not have any questions and is comfortable with all arrangements.
     12.3.9.11. If the visit involves additional escort officers, brief them on base facilities,
     uniform requirements, start time of events, greeting and transporting their assigned DV.
     Provide all escort officers with a copy of the itinerary and protocol plan for after action
     feedback and addressing any problems or comments received from the DV.
  12.3.10. Planning Considerations.
     12.3.10.1. Accommodations. Refer to AFI 34-246, Air Force Lodging Program, Table
     2.1, for information on DV priority. Obtain the following (as appropriate) prior to
     making a reservation: the DV's last name, first name, middle initial, and nickname, rank
     or grade, branch of service, social security number, duty title, home address, purpose of
     visit, installation or city, state or country, date of arrival and departure, total number of
     nights, retirement date and last position held on active duty (if DV is retired), point of
     contact and telephone number.
         12.3.10.1.1. Contact the lodging office and relay the information to the reservation
         clerk. The reservation clerk inputs the information into the lodging computer.
         Confirm DV suites are available. The reservation clerk will assign the DV a room
48                                                      AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


        number and a reservation number. Notify the DV‘s point of contact with lodging
        facility, room number, telephone number, and building number.
        12.3.10.1.2. Check the DV suite before arrival for cleanliness and amenities and
        contact the lodging office if the DV suite does not meet protocol standards. If the DV
        requests particular items that are not in the suite, contact the lodging office to see if
        the items are available. For difficult to fill requests, work with the commander or
        host; consider unrealistic or unfair demands on the staff and their personal finances.
        In addition, consider any negative impact on the mission.
        12.3.10.1.3. Contract Quarters Hotels. In situations where DV suites are fully
        occupied, a DV may have to be lodged at a local hotel. Check with the lodging office
        before selecting a hotel. The lodging office maintains a contract quarter facilities
        listing and will assist in making the reservation. When the DV occupies contract
        quarters, the lodging office will issue the DV a contract quarters statement. The
        statement will include the DV's name, number of nights, name of the hotel, and price
        per night of the quarters. The DV is responsible for paying all room and incidental
        charges when checking out. The hotel keeps a copy of the contract quarters statement
        and will provide a copy to the DV upon checking out. (For additional guidance
        regarding contract quarters, refer to AFI 34-246).
        12.3.10.1.4. Non-availability. In situations when all installation lodging facilities
        and contract quarters are occupied, ask the lodging office to issue a statement of non-
        availability for government quarters.
     12.3.10.2. Welcome Package. A welcome package may be simple or elaborate,
     depending on the DV and purpose of the visit. A welcome basket may be provided for
     certain international DVs, where appropriated funds can be utilized. As a professional
     courtesy, included a welcome note in or placed next to a DV's welcome package. The
     note may be handwritten (preferred) or a preprinted note signed by the commander
     sponsoring the DV's visit. Place the welcome package in a professionally prepared
     folder. Contents will vary, but include at a minimum the following items:
        12.3.10.2.1. An itinerary including biographies of commanders that the DV will meet
        or commanders of installations the DV will visit.
        12.3.10.2.2. Fact sheets on the installations or systems the DV will see.
        12.3.10.2.3. A map of the installation where the DV is staying to include the fitness
        facility.
        12.3.10.2.4. A map of the city where the DV is staying.
        12.3.10.2.5. A dining guide for the installation and the nearest city.
        12.3.10.2.6. Pamphlets on historical places of significance nearby (or in areas that the
        DV is interested).
        12.3.10.2.7. Points of contact for the DV's visit to include home, office and fax
        numbers.
        12.3.10.2.8. Place the welcome package in the DV's room before arrival. If the nature
        of the visit does not include an overnight stay, then include necessary information for
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                    49


           the visit on the itinerary. Established a standard for welcome packages and then
           adjust based on the circumstances of each visit.
       12.3.10.3. Physical Security Considerations.
           12.3.10.3.1. Notify Security Forces (SF) or the Office of Special Investigations
           (OSI), in advance and in writing, when a DV visits an installation. Whether SF or
           OSI or both are notified of a DV's visit, depends primarily on the rank of the DV
           and/or the force protection level (FPCON) which exists at the installation during the
           visit. In some cases, a DV visit may be postponed or canceled based on FPCON. In
           the notification, include all pertinent facts concerning the DV and the places he or she
           plans to visit. Include SF and/or OSI should be on the list of personnel/organizations
           to be notified for last minute changes.
           12.3.10.3.2. For DV visits which include international dignitaries, high ranking
           officials from a foreign government, or high ranking U.S. government officials,
           protocol staff may require coordination with both personal security agents as well as
           local agencies. These individuals may insist on keeping weapons on their person,
           even in restricted or controlled areas. Pre-coordination with the installation
           commander, security officials, and custodians of restricted areas being visited is
           critical. With an agenda that includes public appearances, be aware of the type of
           facility being utilized and whether or not it will be acceptable from a security
           standpoint. Seating arrangements may not follow accepted protocol guidance, but
           rather designed for physical safety of the DV in relation to the layout of the facility.
       12.3.10.4. Classification and Clearance Requirements. If the DV will receive classified
       briefings or tours, be aware of established procedures for ensuring the DV has the
       appropriate clearance to receive the briefings. The DV‘s Special Security Officer (SSO)
       or security manager and the installation counterpart should coordinate. For standard
       classified briefings, obtain the DV's clearance information from the OPR and hand carry
       it during those briefings.
       12.3.10.5. Publicity. If military or civilian press coverage for a DV visit is appropriate,
       contact the Public Affairs office and/or photographic laboratory. In cases where a senior
       DV travels with his or her own Public Affairs representative, that individual will handle
       all publicity arrangements through the local Public Affairs Office. If press coverage is
       anticipated during a visit, check with the DV beforehand to determine his or her desires
       regarding publicity. It is important to specify the type of media to be used. Request
       photographic coverage of a DV visit by submitting AF Form 833, Multimedia Work
       Order, to the installation photographic laboratory in advance of the visit dates.
       12.3.10.6. Transportation. Planning DV transportation from point A to point B may
       require several vehicles, drivers and escort officers or the requirement may be as simple
       as escorting one DV visitor from his or her room, to a meeting location, and then to a
       point of departure. In either case, develop a transportation plan. The plan should answer
       the who, what, when, where and how (and sometimes why) questions.
12.4. International Dignitaries. All international visits to the United States require advance
coordination and approval. These visits are usually sponsored by the service chiefs or the Joint
Chiefs of Staff with an executive agent assigned to coordinate local support and itineraries from
 50                                                         AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


facilities or installations being visited. The Secretary of the Air Force International Affairs
Office (SAF/IA) is the only approval authority for international visits to Air Force installations
per AFPD 16-1, International Affairs. Approval for both the visit and level of disclosure of
classified information must come in writing through official international channels. For self-
invited visitors, the international visitor requesting the visit initiates the request through his or
her respective embassy's air attaché office. The embassy forwards an official request to SAF/IA.
Details will include the level of classification, action officer, requested briefings, and protocol
involvement. The SecAF makes the final determination for approval of the visit.
   12.4.1. The courtesy extended these DVs, whether military or civilian, is based on relative
   rank. When planning an international DV‘s itinerary utilize distinctive local resources to
   vary the guests' exposure to American forms of entertainment. Local Air Force Association
   and civic organizations are often willing to help entertain visiting dignitaries.
   12.4.2. International DVs are usually accompanied by one or more aides of their own armed
   service who are destined for future positions of authority in their own country. They often
   form lasting impressions about the United States based on the treatment accorded them as
   members of a visiting party. Provide special attention to their transportation, dining, and
   recreational arrangements. When possible, provide lodging for the visiting international
   DV's U.S. escort officer in the same building as the foreign dignitary and include the officer
   in the events scheduled for the dignitary. If limited space precludes the escort's inclusion in
   certain social events, make other provisions for the escort's meals.
   12.4.3. Consider the cultural background of visiting international DVs and accommodate,
   whenever possible, individual religious preferences and food or beverage restrictions. At a
   minimum, living accommodations should be single rooms in hotels and in lodging; make
   room assignments based on their status as members of a dignitary's party rather than
   individual rank.
   12.4.4. When possible, provide an escort for an international spouse, taking into
   consideration any language barrier that may exist, his/her age, and position. Utilize officers
   or service wives as escorts whose language capabilities, travel, or position make them
   valuable to the guest. For officially sponsored visits, interpreters for both the DV and spouse
   will be part of the official party.
   12.4.5. While it is preferable to invite persons of comparable stature or rank to a dinner or
   small party, some variety may improve a larger function such as a reception. Try to include
   visitors of the same national origin as the guest of honor as well as a representative selection
   of junior officers.
   12.4.6. Notification to Installations of International Distinguished Visitors. HQ USAF
   usually notifies installations scheduled for foreign dignitary visits at least two weeks prior.
   The notification, tour letter or message, is for planning purposes and usually includes the
   name, rank, and position of the visitors. Other details may include English language
   proficiency; clearance instructions; specific equipment in the hands of foreign government;
   and any particular fields of interest to the visitor. Biographical sketches are furnished, when
   available, in addition to a complete itinerary for the entire tour.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                    51


  12.4.7. Itineraries for International Distinguished Visitors. The itinerary is usually based
  upon the suggestions of the USAF representative in the country concerned and is compiled in
  a manner to serve USAF interests at home and abroad.
  12.4.8. HQ USAF Escort Officer. International dignitaries visiting Air Force installations
  under the auspices of the USAF are usually accompanied by an Air Force escort officer.
  Whenever possible, the escort officer is chosen from those officers currently in training for
  assignment to the attaché or mission system in the country concerned. Solicit the advice of
  the escort officer on any phase of the local itinerary that needs clarification. He or she is
  usually the "paying agent" for the visit and will reimburse authorized expenses.
  12.4.9. Entertainment of International Distinguished Visitors. Tour funding for international
  dignitaries is usually the responsibility of the sponsoring agency. The funds provided
  correspond with the rank of the visitor and objective of the tour.
     12.4.9.1. Historically, visitors prefer small dinner parties to cocktail parties as a means of
     entertainment.
     12.4.9.2. International visitors prefer small, intimate gatherings rather than large groups
     composed of members of the staff and subordinate organizations.
     12.4.9.3. International visitors are often interested in the home life of American people
     and may appreciate an invitation into the commander‘s home for entertainment.
     12.4.9.4. International visitors enjoy joining base functions that have not been planned
     particularly for them, e.g., picnics and barbecues where sport clothing may be worn.
     12.4.9.5. Provide international visitors time for shopping and an opportunity to visit local
     points of economic, historical, and scenic interest such as ranches, farms, museums, and
     parks. Anticipate a visit to the installation's exchange. Coordinate beforehand with the
     exchange manager as part of the contingency planning.
     12.4.9.6. The local escort officer must ensure all entertainment expenses remain within
     the limit established in the tour letter. The cost of quarters and rations are not included in
     these funds and are paid separately by the sponsoring agency escort officer. Provide the
     escort officer a complete itemized bill in sufficient time to enable him/her to pay prior to
     departure and guest lists for each function arranged for the visitor.
  12.4.10. Project Officers for International Distinguished Visitors. Like domestic visits, a
  local project officer or escort officer is appointed to accompany the sponsoring agency escort
  officer and the international visitors during the tour of the installation. The local project
  officer is available for necessary liaison between the sponsoring agency escort officer and the
  installation authorities.
  12.4.11. Briefings for International Distinguished Visitors. Coordinate with the local
  Foreign Disclosure office in advance to determine the level of classification that may be
  briefed to the international DVs. Provide hard copies to the Foreign Disclosure office to
  assist in determining this level of classification. Many international visitors visiting Air
  Force installations understand English only when it is spoken slowly and simply. Their
  English language proficiency and other pertinent data are available in the biographical sketch
  provided by the agency issuing the basic invitation. Unless the international visitor is fluent
  in the English language, briefing personnel should refrain from using complex words or
 52                                                        AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


   sentences. Avoid the use of acronyms or abbreviations. Use simplified organization charts
   and avoid complex visual aids. Briefings should focus primarily on the mission and
   operations.
   12.4.12. Accommodations for International Distinguished Visitors. Provide international
   dignitaries with suitable distinguished visitor accommodations on the installation and needed
   transportation. If a visit extends over a weekend, consider accommodations in the nearest
   city to provide a feel for the American way or life. In most cases, the letter from the
   sponsoring agency will indicate the type of accommodations provided to international
   dignitaries.
   12.4.13. Press and Photographic Coverage for International Distinguished Visitors. Contact
   the local Public Affairs office for guidance. The initial release is made by sponsoring agency
   and followed with whatever coverage the local information services officer considers
   appropriate. Careful consideration should be given to the wishes of the visiting international
   dignitary. If photographic support is required for an international DV visit, submit AF Form
   833 to the installation's photographic laboratory in advance. Pay close attention to ―who,
   when, what, and where‖ concerning the photographs taken in order to identify persons and
   activities when the photographs are developed.
12.5. Execution. Execution is the most crucial aspect of a DV visit. Protocol office staff
ensures the DV stays on schedule in accordance with the published itinerary. Verbally ―dry run‖
the itinerary with a co-worker concentrating on what could go wrong and how to address the
situation. The following outlines additional factors to consider for a successful visit.
   12.5.1. Communications Support.
       12.5.1.1. Double and triple check to ensure all supporting agencies received any last
       minute changes. It is important to communicate with follow-on locations in the itinerary
       when there is an unexpected delay that will affect the schedule. Carry a phone at all
       times during a DV visit. The host or commander relies on protocol staff to update the
       arrival or departure time of the DV for greeting and farewell purposes.
       12.5.1.2. Ensure all personnel or organizations participating in the DV visit have the
       most current copy of the itinerary once the visit begins, to include the DV‘s driver.
       Providing biographical sketches of the DV, proper uniform for the DV's visit and purpose
       of the DV's visit are often the most requested pieces of information by general and flag
       officers responsible for greeting, hosting, or a farewell.
       12.5.1.3. Leave a copy of the itinerary back at the office while the DV visit is in
       progress, so that official personnel can make contact in the event of an emergency or
       answer questions regarding the current status of the visit.
   12.5.2. Contingencies. The itinerary is a living document, and even after publication and
   distribution, often changes; be prepared for contingencies. Suggested items to carry while on
   a DV visit include: extra copies of the itinerary, extra copies of seating charts, extra 1, 2, 3,
   and 4 star table name cards and a calligraphy pen, listing of all phone numbers used on a
   daily basis, small generic memento(s) that can be presented on the spur of the moment, lint
   brush, chewing gum/breath mints, aspirin/antacid tablets, tissues, note paper, envelopes,
   stamps, extra pens, command letterhead, envelopes and an extra phone battery. Contingency
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                   53


  examples    include transportation problems, early or late arrival/departure, medical
  emergency, dental emergency, etc.
  12.5.3. Greet and Farewell.
     12.5.3.1. Failure to properly greet or farewell a DV can set the wrong tone for the rest of
     a visit or ruin what was an excellent visit. Usually a general officer, flag officer, or
     civilian equivalent is greeted and sent-off by a general officer, flag officer, or civilian
     equivalent that is commensurate in rank to the visitor. At installations with no general or
     flag officers assigned, the commander or vice commander greets distinguished visitors.
     When the DV arrives or departs with a spouse, it is appropriate for the greeting/farewell
     party to include a spouse. Protocol is responsible to make sure the greeting/farewell
     party is in the correct location, at the correct time, in the appropriate dress, and provided
     the DV's biographical sketch and itinerary in advance. Be prepared to introduce the
     parties, know first names or nicknames of individuals concerned, and/or know customs
     particular to the visitor‘s country.
     12.5.3.2. Be informed of possible differences in policy between a greet and farewell at a
     military installation versus a commercial terminal, the difference between the DV being
     on official business versus leave, or the difference between the DV being retired or on
     active duty. The installation commander will normally make those decisions.
  12.5.4. Honor Guard or Cordon. In general, honors and ceremonies are reserved for the
  President, Vice President, statutory appointees, general or flag officers of the U.S. military,
  international dignitaries occupying positions comparable to these U.S. officials, regardless of
  rank, and for occasions that such ceremonies promote international goodwill.
     12.5.4.1. Distinguished persons, who are entitled to honors, are listed in AFI 34-1201,
     Attachment 2. This table includes those honors prescribed for statutory civilian and
     military officials of the Department of Defense and does not apply to Civil Service
     Employees. The intent of honors is to extend a mark of courtesy to a distinguished
     person (honors will be accorded only to the distinguished person him or herself and not to
     his or her personal representatives). Honors are accorded to an individual rather than a
     group. A committee or delegation is honored in the person of the senior or ranking
     member.
     12.5.4.2. Unless otherwise directed, full honors must be accorded the President of the
     United States when he arrives at or departs from any Air Force installation, regardless of
     the day or hour. Except for the President, honors are not accorded between retreat and
     reveille, on Sundays, or on national holidays (except Armed Forces and Independence
     Day), unless the officer directing the honors believes the occasion requires an exception.
     A distinguished person arriving at an Air Force installation at a time honors are not
     accorded may be honored at a later time if he or she desires it. When two or more
     persons entitled to honors arrive or depart from an installation at the same time, only the
     senior receives honors. If they arrive or depart successively, honors are paid to each in
     turn, except that a senior visitor must be notified before the installation accords honors to
     a junior visitor. Any official or officer holding two or more positions (civilian or
     military), any one of which entitles him or her to honors, receives only the honors due the
     highest grade; he or she is not honored in more than one capacity.
 54                                                         AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


12.6. Post-Visit.
   12.6.1. Reporting Requirements. Once the DV's aircraft departs, provide the DV's office
   with departure time and expected arrival time at the next destination. Update the Protocol
   offices‘ visitor database (if utilized) with the following topics: title of visit; visitor's full
   name and nickname, visitor's rank/grade or equivalency, branch of service of visitor, visitor's
   organization; title of visitor; country; military or civilian status; date of visit; number of days;
   number in party; command or organization visited; general or flag officers called on; meals
   served; command or organization that hosted visitor; mementos received from visitor (by
   whom and on behalf of, reported as required); mementos presented to visitor (by whom and
   on behalf of); accommodation location; welcome note provided and any significant
   comments or lessons learned. This information will provide a synopsis of the DV's last visit
   and reference should another visit occur in the future.
   12.6.2. Letters of Appreciation. An important aspect of a DV visit is to recognize the effort
   and achievement of personnel who worked hard to make the DV's visit successful. The
   Protocol office should provide recognition in writing as appropriate (i.e. a letter of
   appreciation signed by the installation commander).
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                     55


                                           Chapter 13

                                       CONFERENCES

13.1. Introduction. This chapter provides a guide to preparing for, executing and documenting
conferences.
13.2. Planning Factors.
   13.2.1. Select a date for the conference early, based on the host's availability (and the
   availability of high-level guests or participants) and the availability of conference facilities.
   De-conflict with other major activities in the community that might make it difficult to obtain
   quarters during the conference.
   13.2.2. The commander should appoint an OPR for the conference. If a professional society
   or organization is co-hosting the event, clear lines of authority and responsibility are critical
   planning factors. Assign responsibility for tasks to specific individuals and develop
   milestones for accomplishing these tasks. The staff judge advocate‘s office should review
   plans to provide government resources in support of conferences that include professional
   societies or non-government organizations.
   13.2.3. Determine the agenda and major social events (dinners, formal luncheons,
   entertainment, guest speakers, locations, meal and other costs, etc.) and reserve additional
   facilities as needed. Determine uniform and dress requirements. Identify and determine
   communication requirements (i.e., on call person to provide laptop support, secure phone
   support in lodging, internet access, etc.). Determine the total cost to charge each attendee
   (factor in all conference materials, speaker fees, refreshments, and meals.). Determine types
   of funding authorized and prepare funds requests in advance as required.
   Hotel/accommodation charges are normally the responsibility of the attendee for Air Force
   sponsored conferences.
   13.2.4. Determine spouse attendance early on and include the results of this in any initial
   information papers alerting the command to the conference. For questions regarding spouse
   travel, contact the MAJCOM transportation office.
   13.2.5. Publicize early. Distribute registration information at least eight weeks prior to the
   event. If available, utilize a web page or SharePoint site with conference information that
   includes a registration process that posts data to a conference database. As appropriate,
   distribute a brochure or email with the agenda and proposed guest speakers (After confirming
   tentative speaker availability).
   13.2.6. Professional society or organizational conferences may have a mixture of contractors
   and military attendees. Conference planners need to determine security clearance
   requirements and methods for passing clearances; include these with the registration
   instructions.
   13.2.7. If POV parking is limited at the conference site, plan for transportation of conference
   attendees from hotels to the conference location if POV; reserve resources as required.
   13.2.8. Coordinate escort officers for participating DVs. As appropriate, develop separate
   DV itineraries for visits to the installation or courtesy calls with the commander.
 56                                                       AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


   13.2.9. Arrange for and train escort officers on their duties and responsibilities. We suggest
   assigning each escort officer a single DV, and task them to work with the DV's office on
   travel and other arrangements.
13.3. Intermediate Stages (Two to Three Weeks Out).
   13.3.1. Train selected escort officers if DVs will attend or participate. Refer to Attachment
   5 for an escort officer guide.
   13.3.2. Confirm social arrangements Protocol is responsible for to include facility
   reservations, menus (and prices) and entertainment. Develop inclement weather plans as
   backup for outside activities that are canceled due to bad weather (i.e., afternoon golf
   matches rained or snowed out).
   13.3.3. Confirm the list of invitees and required administrative support for the conference
   (nametags, conference material, etc.)
13.4. Final Stages (One to Two Weeks Out). Begin confirming all earlier coordination.
   13.4.1. Confirm DV participation, itineraries (to include any inclement weather plans), and
   escort officer responsibilities (office calls, briefings, etc.).
   13.4.2. Confirm lodging, transportation, meal, and entertainment arrangements.
   13.4.3. Draft seating plans as needed. (Table seating arrangements are addressed in
   Attachment 2). To facilitate making last minute changes without affecting the entire seating
   plan, consider arranging seating by position rather than rank.
   13.4.4. Complete all administrative or computer-generated support items (nametags, name
   cards, programs, seating diagrams, table plans, parking signs, etc.). Consider space
   allocation for a protocol command post and a separate work area for visiting support staff.
   13.4.5. Confirm who will greet/host/farewell all attending DVs and provide this information
   to escort officers.

                                 MILITARY CEREMONIES

14.1. Ceremony General Management.
   14.1.1. Uniforms. The event project officer should determine the uniform combination as
   far in advance as possible.
   14.1.2. Event Location. The project officer will confirm reservation of facilities or location
   by the funding unit. Location should be chosen with careful consideration for parking
   accessibility, seating capacity, and military appropriateness.
      14.1.2.1. Ramp Freeze/Quiet Hours. If appropriate to the ceremony, coordinate a request
      with Airfield management for a ramp freeze or quiet hours.
   14.1.3. Officiating Official. The officiating official of a retirement, promotion, or award
   ceremony should be the first appropriate individual in the honoree‘s chain of command,
   officer or senior civilian. The officiating official should be higher in grade to the honoree. It
   is not appropriate for enlisted members to officiate a ceremony. If the honoree desires
   someone other than the first appropriate individual in the chain, the honoree should discuss
   this with his or her supervisor. An SES or GS may officiate at all ceremonies with the
   exception of enlistment/reenlistment and initial commission ceremonies for officers. These
   ceremonies require an active, reserve, guard or retired officer to officiate. As an officiating
   official, an SES or GS may administer the oath of office when it is purely ceremonial in
   nature. Ensure General Officers or SESs with a participating role in the ceremony, which are
   neither the hosts nor just guests (i.e. making remarks, presenting a medal, etc.), are included
   in the official party. Personal or positional colors should be posted and musical honors
   played for the highest rank of the person in the official party, even if not the host.
   14.1.4. Invitations. When required, the event project officer should send out invitations to
   allow sufficient time for attendees to R.s.v.p. for the event.
   14.1.5. Programs. As appropriate, the event project officer should have programs produced
   for the ceremony in accordance with funding guidelines.
   14.1.6. Briefings. The event project officer should conduct a briefing with the presiding
   official and honoree to review all aspects of the ceremony prior to the ceremony. It is
   recommended that the briefings take place approximately thirty days prior to the ceremony.
   14.1.7. Flags may be pre-posted for most events if resources or stage space is limited.
   14.1.8. Music is not a requirement for a ceremony, but if appropriate and available, may be
   used to add decorum to the ceremony
      14.1.8.1. ―Arrival Fanfare‖ is played while the official party is in motion; musical honors
      for general officers and above (―Ruffles and Flourishes‖, etc.) are rendered once the
      official party is in position in front of their chairs. ―Ruffles and Flourishes‖ is not played
      while the party is in motion.
      14.1.8.2. When the presiding official of a ceremony is a retired general officer, musical
      honors are played only if the presiding officer is in uniform.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                  59


     14.1.8.3. When the presiding official of a ceremony is an SES, musical honors are not
     played.
     14.1.8.4. During musical honors, while customary for those in attendance to face the
     general officer, it is not necessary for persons standing immediately beside the general
     officer to face in his or her direction.
     14.1.8.5. During outdoor ceremonies, and when musical honors are rendered, military
     members in uniform face and salute the person being honored. The person for whom the
     honors are rendered also salutes (as a symbolic gesture of ―returning‖ the salute).
  14.1.9. Any official or unofficial gathering of military and civilians that includes a meal as
  part of the activity (awards ceremony, dining in or out, farewell/retirement dinners, etc), may
  include Comrades at Arms and/or POW/MIA tables/ceremonies. While there is the option
  for POW/MIA and Comrades At Arms tables/ceremonies, there can be either, both, or
  neither based on the desires/concurrence of the local and/or hosting commander.
     14.1.9.1. The POW/MIA table/ and Comrades At Arms tables are separate entities; do
     not combine them.
     14.1.9.2. If a POW/MIA table is incorporated into an event, the official script must be
     used.
     14.1.9.3. A Comrades at Arms table will include a written tribute to remind the audience
     of the courage, sacrifice and service of men and women currently serving in harm's way,
     both at home and abroad, and in troubled areas of the world. A ―Comrades at Arms‖
     script should be generic in nature, not referring to any one person or group on a personal
     level.
  14.1.10. Floral presentations may be made on behalf of all the men and women of the Air
  Force or by the honoree during ceremonies. Typically, the honoree or the office of the
  honoree pays for flowers.
  14.1.11. Receiving Lines. A receiving line usually includes the U.S. Flag, USAF Flag, and
  general officer‘s personal colors or a Senior Executive Service member‘s individual flag.
  The honoree stands in front of the flags and receives guests first, followed by the spouse.
  Additional family members are not recommended in receiving lines in order to prevent line
  stagnation.
  14.1.12. Ceremony Pre-brief. Prior to any ceremony, provide the official party and spouses
  with a summary of the sequence of events. Detail their movements to familiarize them with
  the entire event.
  14.1.13. While General Officers and SES are entitled to personal/positional colors (PCs) and
  musical honors (for civilian positions listed in attachment 2 of AFI 34-1201) for any event
  they participating in, its Air Force tradition the PCs and musical honors are not posted or
  played at breakfasts, luncheons, and dinners. PCs are posted and musical honors are played
  only at ceremonies. However, if the event is a combination of both (i.e. Dining-In/Out and
  Graduation Dinner), then PCs are posted and musical honors played.
  14.1.14. The Sequences of Events listed in the following ceremonies are approved by the Air
  Force.
 60                                                       AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


14.2. Military Funerals.
   14.2.1. General. The USAF Honor Guard or the Base Honor Guard under the provisions of
   AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program, typically conducts military funerals.
   14.2.2. Dress. Military attendees of a military funeral must wear service dress uniforms with
   flight or service cap. All attendees should be prepared to wear appropriate inclement weather
   apparel during poor weather (i.e. overcoat, raincoat, black gloves, scarf, etc.). Funeral attire
   for civilians should be subdued in color and for females, a limited amount of bare skin
   displayed.
   14.2.3. Flyovers are conducted under the provisions of AFI 34-242.
   14.2.4. Universally accepted etiquette at a cemetery includes speaking quietly, refraining
   from stepping on graves and not intruding on mourners. Uniformed personnel must, and
   veterans not in uniform may if they desire, salute whenever the casket or urn is moved - from
   the hearse, from the house of worship, and at the interment site. A salute is also rendered
   during military funeral honors.
   14.2.5. Funeral Service. Upon the request of the next of kin, a service may be held before
   the military funeral followed by a procession to the funeral gravesite. Unit or family
   representatives are responsible for conducting these services. High-ranking military and
   government officials may be invited, but it is important to remember that this is a time
   focused on family and friends. The wishes of the next-of-kin are paramount.
      14.2.5.1. At the request of the family, a family representative may work closely with the
      Chaplain and Honor Guard to ensure a smooth flow of events and guidance to guests.
      The family representative or ushers may ensure that a sufficient number of seats on the
      right front of the chapel/house of worship are reserved for the immediate family, who are
      seated before the casket or urn is taken in. The front pew(s) on the left are typically
      reserved for honorary pallbearers if needed. If pallbearers are used to carry the casket or
      urn into position inside the chapel/house of worship, seats are typically reserved for them
      at the rear.
      14.2.5.2. High ranking military or government officials are greeted as guests and shown
      or directed to a seat along with other guests. It is not typical to reserve seating at a
      service for attendees other than for family and honorary pallbearers.
      14.2.5.3. If a procession to the gravesite will follow the service, a family representative
      may help direct guests to follow the hearse and family member vehicles. At the
      graveside, if there are seats for family, the family representative may help guide family
      members to them and invite other guests to gather around the family.
   14.2.6. Remains Arrival. When remains of the deceased arrive and pass before military
   personnel those in uniform salute, unless walking, until the remains are stationary. Civilians
   should place their right hand over their heart during the movement of remains, unless
   walking.
   14.2.7. Funeral Military Honors. The three volleys fired by the firing party and Taps played
   by the bugler are considered military honors. Both military and civilians attending the
   funeral service will rise for military honors and be seated at the conclusion of military
   honors. Military members will render the hand salute from the beginning of the firing
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                   61


   sequence until the conclusion of Taps. Civilians place their right hand over their heart during
   military honors.
      14.2.7.1. Personal Colors. For funerals honoring general officers, their personal colors
      are present. During the ceremony, the honor guard will furl and case the personal colors.
      This is the only instance when personal colors are furled and cased.
14.3. Individual Retirements.
   14.3.1. General. Recognition upon retirement is a long-standing tradition of military service.
   Commanders ensure members leave with a tangible expression of appreciation for their
   contributions to the Air Force and its mission, and with the assurance they will continue to be
   a part of the Air Force family in retirement. Since retirement ceremonies are ceremonial in
   nature, SES/GS individuals may act as the presiding official. Enlisted members may not
   officiate a retirement ceremony. Consult AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements, for retirement
   planning details.
   14.3.2. Sequence of Events. The following is the approved sequence of events for indoor
   retirement ceremonies. The order of the remarks by the speakers may be adjusted as desired
   by the host of the ceremony. Bolded items are general officer specific; italicized items are
   optional. Outdoor retirement ceremonies are occasionally conducted in conjunction with
   parades. See Air Force Manual 36-2203, Drill and Ceremonies, for further guidance on
   outdoor retirements. If more than one individual is retiring in the same ceremony, retirement
   order is by rank, highest to lowest. However, if awards are being presented, retirements are
   conducted in order of awards being presented IAW this instruction, paragraph 14.9.3, rule for
   ease of ceremony movement. (For example, a Master Sergeant receiving a higher award than
   a Major is retired first.)

   14.3.3. Flag Furling and Casing. The furling of personal colors is not authorized at
   retirement ceremonies. The personal colors of general officers remain active after retirement
   and displayed at the appropriate times (See AFI 34-1201, Chapter 2) Casing of a general
   officer‘s or SES member‘s personal flag is not appropriate during a retirement ceremony as it
   is symbolic of the death of the individual. For general officers, casing of the personal colors
   is performed at the conclusion of the funeral.
   14.3.4. A retirement ceremony is a military ceremony; other types of tributes such as videos,
   dramatic flag folding or passing, gift presentations from various groups or individuals should
   be conducted during informal activities surrounding a retirement ceremony (i.e. reception,
   dinner, or luncheon) instead of the official ceremony.
14.4. Promotion Ceremony.
   14.4.1. General. Promotions are significant events in the lives of military people.
   Commanders and supervisors are responsible for ensuring their people receive proper
   recognition. Since promotion ceremonies are ceremonial in nature, SES/GS individuals may
   act as the presiding official, to include administering the oath of office, except for initial
   commissioning ceremonies. Enlisted members may not officiate a promotion ceremony.
   14.4.2. Sequence of Events. The following is an approved sequence of events for an indoor
   promotion ceremony. The order of the remarks by the speakers may be adjusted as desired
   by the host of the ceremony. Bolded items are general officer specific; italicized items are
   optional. Promotion ceremonies are typically held indoors.

  14.4.3. Group Promotions.      Multiple promotion ceremonies should be sequenced in
  descending rank order.
  14.4.4. Personal Colors. At the discretion of the host or honoree, there are three options for
  presenting the new personal colors.
     14.4.4.1. Option 1. During a general officer‘s promotion, their personal colors are
     present. During the ceremony for promotion to Major General and above, the honor
     guard will retrieve the previous rank personal colors and discreetly exit the room,
     additional honor guard members then uncase and unfurl the new rank personal colors.
     14.4.4.2. Option 2. In this sequence, the new personal colors (the new rank personal
     colors) and the previous personal colors (the old rank personal colors) are both used.
     Two personal colors bearers march in side by side (space permitting). The new personal
     colors bearer halts two paces to the right side and slightly in front of the official party.
     The previous personal colors bearer continues marching to retrieve the previous personal
     colors from its posted position with the displayed flags, then returns to a position to the
     left of the honoree facing the new personal colors bearer. Upon halting, the personal
     colors bearers drop both personal colors simultaneously to a position parallel to the
     ground with the previous personal colors nearest the official party. As the previous
     personal colors are furled and cased, the new personal colors are unfurled simultaneously.
     A third person may be used to uncase the new personal colors. Both personal colors
     bearers then bring them back to the vertical position, the previous personal colors bearer
     exits the room and the new personal colors bearer posts the new personal colors next to
     the displayed flags.
     14.4.4.3. Option 3. In this sequence, the new personal colors are furled, cased, and pre-
     posted. The honor guard marches in side by side (space permitting). One honor guard
     member posts forward of the official party while the second member retrieves the new
     personal colors then moves forward to the first member. The new personal colors are
     lowered, uncased, and unfurled. The new personal colors are then raised. The honor

       guard member with the flag marches into place behind and between the official party as
       the other member departs. The honor guard member presents the new personal colors to
       the officiating officer who then presents to the honoree. The honoree passes the personal
       colors back to the honor guard member who then re-posts the personal colors next to the
       displayed flags and departs.
   14.4.5. Oath of Office (from AFI 36-2501, Officer Promotions and Selective Continuation).
―I, (NAME), having been appointed a (grade in which appointed), United States Air
Force, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution
of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true
faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental
reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the
duties of the office upon which I am about to enter, so help me God.‖
14.5. Change of Command.
   14.5.1. General. The primary purpose of a change of command ceremony is to allow
   subordinates to witness the formality of command change from one officer to another. The
   ceremony should be official, formal, brief and conducted with great dignity.
   14.5.2. For SES/GS individuals participating in these ceremonies, substitute the word
   ―Leadership‖ for ―Command‖ on all items (i.e. invitations, script). SES/GS cannot command
   and do not salute. Statements such as ―Sir /Ma’am, I relinquish leadership.” should be
   substituted in the script.
   14.5.3. Sequence of Events. This is an approved sequence of events for indoor change of
   command ceremonies. The order of the remarks by the speakers may be adjusted as desired
   by the host of the ceremony. Bolded items are general officer specific; italicized items are
   optional.

   14.5.4. Flag/Guidon Exchange. The flag/guidon is exchanged during the change of
   command as a symbolic gesture providing a tangible view of the command authority being
   transferred from one commander to the next. The sequence for the exchange begins with
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                 65


  three participants standing abreast, from left to right as viewed from the audience, presiding
  officer, outgoing commander, and incoming commander. A fourth participant, the
  flag/guidon bearer, takes a position behind and between the presiding officer and outgoing
  commander. The flag/guidon bearer gives a subdued command, (Officers, Center); the
  presiding officer executes a left face while the two commanders execute a right face. The
  outgoing commander salutes the presiding officer, while stating, ―Sir/Ma’am, I relinquish
  command.” The presiding officer returns salute. The outgoing commander takes the
  flag/guidon from the flag/guidon bearer, holding the flag and angling the top of flag towards
  the head of the flag/guidon bearer, and presents it to the presiding officer with presiding
  officer hands on top. The outgoing commander takes one step to the right, two steps back and
  one step to the left; simultaneously, the incoming commander takes two steps forward, taking
  the outgoing commander‘s place. The presiding officer presents the flag/guidon to the
  incoming commander who firmly receives the flag/guidon and passes it to the flag/guidon
  bearer. The incoming commander salutes the presiding officer, while stating, ―Sir/Ma’am, I
  assume command.‖ The presiding officer returns the salute. The flag/guidon bearer gives a
  subdued command, (Officers, Post). All three officers face forward.
  14.5.5. Assumption of Command. Assumption of command ceremonies occur when there is
  a time lapse between the departure of a commander and the arrival of a new commander. An
  assumption of command sequence is identical to a change of command sequence, with the
  obvious omission of the award presentation and outgoing commander‘s remarks. The
  flag/guidon exchange sequence varies from a change of command. The presiding officer and
  incoming commander face the audience. The flag/guidon bearer takes a position behind and
  between the presiding officer and the commander. The flag/guidon bearer gives a subdued
  command, (Officers, Center); the presiding officer executes a left face while the incoming
  commander executes a right face. The incoming commander salutes the presiding officer and
  states, ―Sir/Ma’am, I assume command.‖ The presiding officer returns salute. The presiding
  officer takes the flag/guidon from the flag/guidon bearer and, holding the flag and angling
  top of the flag towards the head of flag/guidon bearer, presents it to the incoming commander
  who firmly receives it and passes it to the flag/guidon bearer. The flag/guidon bearer gives a
  subdued command, (Officers, Post). Both officers face forward.
  14.5.6. Appointment to Command. Appointment to command ceremonies are executed the
  same as assumption of command ceremonies. Appointment to command differs from
  assumption of command only from a succession of command perspective. See AFI 51-604,
  Appointment to and Assumption of Command, for details.
  14.5.7. Relinquishment of Command. There is no approved ceremony in the Air Force
  called a ―Relinquishment of Command‖, nor is there funding for such a ceremony. AFI 51-
  604 and AFMAN 36-2203 make no reference to relinquishment of command. A ceremony
  called or based on relinquishment of command (example ―Celebration of Command‖) will
  not be executed by Air Force personnel.
  14.5.8. First Salute / Last Salute. There is no history or tradition of a first salute or last
  salute at Change of Command/Assumption of Command ceremonies in the Air Force; nor are
  they addressed in AFMAN 36-2203. The correct action for the outgoing commander or

   sequence of events for activation/inactivation ceremonies. Bolded items are general officer
   specific; italicized items are optional. March On, Presentation of Command and
   Advancement of the Colors are outdoor ceremony specific. A reactivation ceremony is
   identical to an activation ceremony with only obvious changes to narration.

   14.6.2. Flag/Guidon Exchange, Activation (Reactivation). The flag/guidon exchange
   sequence for an activation/reactivation ceremony begins immediately following the new flag
   unfurling, with the host and incoming commander facing the audience. The flag/guidon
   bearer takes a position behind and between presiding officer and commander. The
   flag/guidon bearer gives a subdued command, (Officers, Center); the presiding officer
   executes a left face while the incoming commander executes a right face. The incoming
   commander then salutes the presiding officer and states, ―Sir/Ma’am, I assume command‖.
   The presiding officer takes the flag/guidon from the flag/guidon bearer, holding the flag
   angled towards the flag/guidon bearer, and presents it to the incoming commander who
   firmly receives it and passes it to the flag/guidon bearer. The flag/guidon bearer gives a
   subdued command, (Officers, Post). Both officers face forward.
   14.6.3. Flag/Guidon Exchange, Inactivation. The flag/guidon exchange sequence for an
   inactivation ceremony begins immediately before the flag furling with the presiding officer
   and commander facing the audience. The flag/guidon bearer takes a position behind and
   between the presiding officer and the commander. The flag/guidon bearer gives a subdued
   command, (Officers, Center); the presiding officer executes a left face while the outgoing
   commander executes a right face. The outgoing commander salutes the presiding officer
   while stating, ―Sir/Ma’am, I relinquish command.”; the presiding officer returns salute. The
   outgoing commander takes the flag/guidon from the flag/guidon bearer, holding the flag
   angled towards the flag/guidon bearer, and presents it to presiding officer with presiding

   officer hands on top. The presiding officer gives the flag/guidon to the flag/guidon bearer,
   who prepares for the flag furling sequence.
   14.6.4. Redesignation sequence of events. This is a traditional sequence of events for
   redesignation ceremonies. Bolded items are general officer specific; italicized items are
   optional. March On, Presentation of Command, and Advancement of the Colors are outdoor
   ceremony specific.

   14.6.5. Flag furling/unfurling. At the discretion of the presiding officer, a flag furling (or
   unfurling) may be performed instead of simply removing and posting the flag/guidons. It is
   most appropriate to perform this sequence immediately after the redesignation is read. Two
   flag/guidon bearers march in side by side (space permitting), the new flag/guidon bearer halts
   two paces to the side and slightly in front of the official party. The previous flag/guidon
   bearer continues marching to retrieve the previous flag/guidon from its posted position with
   the displayed flags, then returns to a position next to the new flag/guidon bearer. Upon
   halting, the flag/guidon bearers drop both flag/guidons simultaneously to a position parallel
   to the ground. As the previous flag/guidon is furled, the new flag/guidon is unfurled. A third
   person may be used to uncase the new guidon, then case the previous flag/guidon. Both
   flag/guidon bearers then bring the flag/guidons back to the vertical position, the previous
   flag/guidon bearer exits the room and the new flag/guidon bearer posts the new flag/guidon
   next to the displayed flags.
14.7. Re-enlistment Ceremony.
   14.7.1. General.      Unit commanders will honor all reenlistees through a dignified
   reenlistment ceremony. The airman may request any commissioned officer to perform the
   ceremony and may invite guests. The member's immediate family should be invited. This
   reinforces the fact that when a member makes a commitment to the Air Force, the family is
   also making a commitment. Any active duty, reserve, guard, or retired commissioned officer
   of the U.S. Armed Forces may perform the ceremony, which may be conducted in any place
 68                                                       AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


   that lends dignity to the event. The U.S. flag must form a backdrop for the participants.
   Reenlistees and reenlisting officers must wear an authorized uniform for the ceremony.
   (EXCEPTION: The uniform requirement is optional for retired officers.)
   14.7.2. Procedures. The core of the ceremony is the oath of enlistment. The oath is recited
   by the officer and repeated by the re-enlistee. The re-enlistee and the officer administering
   the oath must be physically collocated during the ceremony. Once completed, the officer
   congratulates the re-enlistee and invites the other attendees to do the same. Refreshments
   may be served.
   14.7.3. Enlisted Oath. ―I, (NAME), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and
   defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I
   will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, and that I will obey the orders of President of
   the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations
   and the uniform code of military justice—so help me God.‖
14.8. Award Ceremony.
   14.8.1. General. An award ceremony affords an opportunity to recognize a member's
   accomplishments. The commander or other official determines whether to present an award
   at a formal ceremony or to present it informally. Many units present awards during
   commander's call. Commanders and supervisors must ensure the presentation method reflects
   the significance of the award.
   14.8.2. Sequence. This sequence can be used when an award presentation is made
   separately from a commander‘s call. Bolded items are general officer specific; italicized
   items are optional. Due to the brevity of this variety of ceremony, all musical elements are
   optional and colors can be pre-posted.

14.9. Decoration Ceremony.
   14.9.1. General.     Decoration ceremonies formally recognize service members for
   meritorious service, outstanding achievement, or heroism. A formal and dignified ceremony
   is necessary to preserve the integrity and value of decorations. When possible, the
   commander should personally present the decoration. Regardless of location, the ceremony
   should be conducted at the earliest possible date after approval of the decoration. All
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                   69


   military participants and attendees wear the uniform specified by the host. If in doubt, the
   blue uniform rather than the airman battle uniform (ABU) is recommended. It is also proper
   for participating retired members to wear a uniform. At the commander's discretion, a
   photographer may take pictures during the ceremony.
   14.9.2. Procedures. Although decoration ceremonies may differ slightly from one unit to
   another, they normally begin by announcing "ATTENTION TO ORDERS." All members in
   attendance stand at attention and face the commander and the recipient. The commander's
   assistant reads the citation while the commander and recipient stand at attention. After the
   reading of the citation, the commander and recipient face each other and the commander
   affixes the medal on the individual's uniform. The commander then extends personal
   congratulations and a handshake while presenting the decoration certificate. The recipient
   salutes the commander and the commander returns the salute to conclude the formal part of
   the ceremony. Attendees are then invited to personally congratulate the recipient and enjoy
   any refreshments provided.
   14.9.3. Sequence. Bolded items are general officer specific; italicized items are optional.
   Due to the brevity of this variety of ceremony, all musical elements are optional and colors
   may be pre-posted. If multiple awards are being presented, ceremony order is by award from
   highest to lowest, not by rank of individual. If the same award is being presented, it should
   be completed by sequential number of the award (i.e. second oak leaf cluster is award before
   first oak leaf cluster). If everything is equal, then award by rank, highest rank first.

14.10. Reveille and Retreat.
   14.10.1. General. The U.S. Flag is flown daily from reveille until retreat. Reveille, the
   raising of the colors for the day‘s activities, is a ceremony in which the unit honors the U.S.
   flag when it is raised in the morning. Retreat, the retirement of the colors from the day's
   activities, is a ceremony in which the unit honors the U.S. flag when it is lowered in the
   evening.
   14.10.2. Dress. Military attendees of reveille and retreat should wear uniform of the day
   unless ordered otherwise by the installation commander. Military members conducting the
   ceremony should wear their service dress uniform with flight or service cap. All attendees
   should be prepared to wear appropriate inclement weather apparel during poor weather (i.e.
   overcoat, raincoat, black gloves, scarf, etc.).
 70                                                        AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


   14.10.3. Timing. The sounding, for both reveille and retreat, is decided by the installation
   commander. Reveille shall be played for 20 seconds. During this time, the flag is raised
   quickly to the top of the flagpole. During retreat, the flag is lowered slowly and
   ceremoniously. The two bugle calls sounded at retreat are ―Retreat‖ and ―To The Color.‖
   Uniformed personnel in formation during the playing of ―Retreat,‖ should be at the position
   of parade rest, then assume the position of attention. Uniformed personnel not in formation
   during the playing of ―Retreat,‖ should be at the position of attention. The flag should reach
   the bottom at the last note of "To The Color." ―The Star Spangled Banner‖ may be played
   instead of "To The Color" during a retreat ceremony.
   14.10.4. Formation. During Reveille and Retreat ceremonies, when in a formation or a
   group, the senior military member present will call the group to ―Attention‖ and then
   ―Parade, Rest‖ at the first note of Reveille or Retreat. That member will then call the group
   to ―Attention‖ and ―Present, Arms‖ at the first note of ―To The Color‖ or the ―The Star
   Spangled Banner‖ and then ―Order, Arms‖ at the conclusion.
   14.10.5. Civilian and Motorist Honors. In 1812, Reveille was a drum call, but as time
   passed it came to mark when the flag was raised in the morning and honors paid to it. Since
   it is no longer only a call for soldiers to rise in the morning, it is proper for all military and
   civilian personnel to afford honors to the flag during these ceremonies when the flag is being
   raised or lowered. When Reveille or Retreat is played simply as a bugle call to signal the
   beginning or end of the duty day, no courtesies are required. If Reveille or Retreat is played
   as a prelude to the national anthem or ―To The Color,‖ members of the Armed Forces and
   veterans who are present, but not in uniform, may render the military salute when outdoors.
   All other individuals stand at attention and place their right hand (with a hat if wearing one)
   over their heart. Vehicles in motion should stop.
14.11. Building Dedication/Ribbon Cutting.
   14.11.1. General. A building dedication/ribbon cutting ceremony is the opportunity to
   formally recognize the completion/opening of a new building or facility.
   14.11.2. Sequence. This is the traditional, authorized sequence of events for a building
   dedication or ribbon cutting ceremony. Bolded items are general officer specific; italicized
   items are optional.

  14.12.2. Equipment.
     14.12.2.1. Ceremonial Army, Marine, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and civilian cap (1
     of each).
  14.12.3. Support Material.
     14.12.3.1. A round table, a white table cloth, six chairs, Bible (optional), red rose
     displayed in vase, yellow ribbon, slice of lemon on a bread plate with a pinch of salt,
     place setting at an open table, and (6) wine glasses. (Note: All support material should
     be supplied by the host).
  14.12.4. Preparation.
     14.12.4.1. NCOIC meets with host upon arrival at ceremony site to review specifics:
     entrance cue; entrance and departure area; ensure there is enough room around the table
     for all team members to walk; proper set-up of table (yellow ribbon tied around vase and
     placed in the middle of the table; Bible (optional) placed next to the vase; bread plate
     with slice of lemon and pinch of salt on it placed next to the Bible and the vase; one place
     setting with plate, silverware, and wineglass; the other five wineglasses placed evenly
     around the table in empty place settings). The table should occupy a prominent position
     in the layout of the room.
  14.12.5. Sequence of Events.
     14.12.5.1. Fifteen minutes prior to the ceremony, the team lines up outside of the
     entrance: holding hats in correct Joint Service order (Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force,
     Coast Guard and civilian), at waist level, and with the bill of the hat pointing out.
     14.12.5.2. Once the narrator starts reading the POW/MIA Hat Table script, the team is
     queued and enters the room headed toward the table.
     14.12.5.3. Upon reaching the table, the team circles it once. The NCOIC calls ―HALT‖
     when the Air Force hat is in front of the full place setting for the second time.
     14.12.5.4. NCOIC calls ―Ready, Face‖ and the team faces the table.
     14.12.5.5. The NCOIC starts the movement and, at the same time, all bearers move their
     right hands slowly around the front of the bill to the left side of the hat, touching their left
     hand. Then letting go with the left hand and keeping it in position, turning the hat around
     180 degrees. Bearers then bend over and place hat in the place setting.
     14.12.5.6. The bearers let go of the hat, stand up at attention, reach out with their right
     hand, and cup the wineglasses. All wine glasses will be lifted out in front of the bearers
     meeting in the center of the table. Glasses are turned upside down and then lowered back
     down to the table.
 72                                                       AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


       14.12.5.7. When the glasses are securely on the table, the bearers come back to the
       position of attention.
       14.12.5.8. NCOIC calls ―Present, Arms.‖ The bearers perform a three-second present
       and a three-second order.
       14.12.5.9. Once back at the position of attention, the NCOIC calls ―Ready, Face.‖ All
       bearers perform a right face, wait one count, and then step off with no arm swing toward
       the predetermined departure area (Note: If the host wishes, after the dinner is over, the
       team may go back in and retrieve the hats; this is performed in the exact opposite order.
       All commands are subdued and called only loud enough for the team members to hear).
       14.12.5.10. The playing of Taps is not part of the POW/MIA ceremony. The playing of
       Taps is symbolic of the death of a service member; it is not appropriate for POW/MIAs
       who have not been declared as deceased.
   14.12.6. Script. The following is the recommended script according to the POW/MIA
   league of families and endorsed by the Department of Defense:
             MISSING MAN TABLE & HONORS CEREMONY
             COURTESY OF
             NATIONAL LEAGUE OF FAMILIES
             OF AMERICAN PRISONERS AND MISSING IN SOUTHEAST ASIA

Narrator: ―As you entered the dining area, you may have noticed a table at the front, raised to
call your attention to its purpose – it is reserved to honor our missing loved ones (or missing
comrades in arms, for veterans).
Set for six, the empty places represent Americans (our men and women) still missing from each
of the five services – Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard – and civilians. This
honors ceremony symbolizes that they are with us, here in spirit.
Some (here) in this room were very young when they went into combat; however, all Americans
should never forget the brave men and women who answered our nation‘s call (to serve) and
served the cause of freedom in a special way.
I would like to ask you to stand, and remain standing for a moment of silent prayer, as the Honor
Guard places the five service covers and a civilian cap on each empty plate.‖

In silence or with dignified, quiet music as background, the Honor Guard moves into position
around the table and simultaneously place covers of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force,
Coast Guard and civilian hat, on the dinner plate at each table setting. The Honor Guard
departs.

Narrator: ―Please be seated (pause). I would like to explain the meaning of the items on this
special table.
The table is round – to show our everlasting concern for our missing men (and women).
The tablecloth is white – symbolizing the purity of their motives when answering the call to
duty.
The single red rose, displayed in a vase, reminds us of the life of each of the missing, and the
loved ones and friends of these Americans who keep the faith, awaiting answers.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                      73


The vase is tied with a yellow ribbon, symbol of our continued determination to account for our
missing.
A slice of lemon on the bread plate is to remind us of the bitter fate of those captured and
missing in a foreign land.
A pinch of salt symbolized the tears endured by those missing and their families who seek
answers.
(Optional) The Bible represents the strength gained through faith to sustain those lost from our
country, founded as one nation under God.
This glass is inverted – to symbolize their inability to share this evening‘s (morning‘s/day‘s)
toast.
The chairs are empty – they are missing.
Let us now raise our water glasses in toast to honor America‘s POW/MIAs and to the success of
our efforts to account for them.‖

Note: The number of personnel can be varied from one to six. The ceremony can be altered as
to the number of hats and personnel. You can also place the hats as the latter part of the script is
read and invert the glasses as the script mentions it.

       14.13.5.1. An empty chair is placed at the end left or right position of the head table prior
       to guests entering the event. If round tables are used then place the empty chair at any
       position at the head table.
   14.13.6. Script
Narrator: ―Ladies and Gentlemen, as we enjoy this evening of fellowship, we are reminded that
not everyone is so privileged. At our head table this evening, we have an empty chair. This
chair is empty by design. We placed it there for distinguished guests who cannot be with us
today. This place is reserved to honor our fallen warriors.

Today‘s military member is well equipped and skilled in military combat and warfare for
peaceful purposes and preserves the rights of men and women everywhere to be free of tyranny
and terrorism. They are dedicated to the cause of peaceful coexistence on a global level. They
go on duty each day knowing it might be the day they are asked to make the ultimate sacrifice.
They are not the ―summer soldier or sunshine patriot‖.

Our military service men and women are adept in many disciplines and each warrior has unique
skills they contribute, not only to their military service, but also to their personal lives and their
communities. Society recognizes our American military servicemen and women as an elite
group.

As we reflect upon this empty chair, we come face to face with the stark reality that some of our
warriors and personal heroes have indeed been called upon to make that ultimate sacrifice. They
are our brothers and sisters, our friends; and, our comrades-in-arms. Their absence is
symbolized by this simple empty chair. Their sacrifice was not simple, nevertheless, as
warriors, they would not want great ceremony or fanfare made of their heroic action.

Their death leaves a wake of sorrow for us, their friends and families. But, it also leaves a legacy
of pride in the time honored tradition of selflessness and dedicated service to country. A grateful
nation mourns its loss. And, today we honor them. They are national treasures and inspire
people everywhere seeking freedom from oppression and the right to live with dignity.

So with this empty chair and with a moment of silence, we few, we band of brothers and sisters
remember our fallen. In our hearts, we wish them peace and eternal rest from their toil. We will
not forget them. And, we continue to honor them for their selfless sacrifice on behalf of the
United States of America.‖

 Note: Taps may or not may not be played at this time. After a moment of silence and playing of
Taps (if played), the narrator continues with the program. Do not over use the playing of Taps;
reserve only for the most formal of ceremonies (i.e., Air Force birthday celebrations, balls, etc.)
14.14. Memorial Service
14.14.1. General. Unit Memorial Services are not required but often conducted to facilitate
the grieving and healing process of the family and unit members and friends. They are normally
held within days of a person's death. These services are very personal in nature and the structure
is typically facilitated by base Chaplains, the unit Commander, and the Mortuary Officer, with
input from the family. The deceased and/or their family may, or may not, be present at the unit
Memorial Service. The unit Memorial Service is not part of the mortuary entitlement the family
receives upon death of a loved one; as such, it is not Air Force funded. Care must be taken not to
confuse this unit service with the funeral/memorial service where the loved one will receive
appropriate military funeral honors and entitlements. AFI 34-242, paragraph 8.2, provides that
―The Air Force will provide funeral honors and a flyover (if the member is eligible) at the place
of final disposition, or at a memorial service. Funeral honors will not be provided more than
once‖. However, in some situations, the family may choose to identify the unit Memorial
Service as the location to receive their mortuary entitlements; careful coordination with the base
Mortuary Officer is critical.
   14.14.2. The Honor Guard may, or may not, be involved in a unit Memorial Service.
   Military funeral honors, if authorized, will only be provided at the direction of the person
   authorized to direct disposition. Any request for honors performed by the Honor Guard
   should be coordinated closely with the base Mortuary Officer. If the final place of interment
   is Arlington National Cemetery, funeral honors must be provided at Arlington National
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                    75


   Cemetery by the Air Force Honor Guard and Band. In this situation, honors will not be
   provided at a unit Memorial Service.
   14.14.3. Sample Sequence of Events. This is one example of a Memorial Service.
            SEQUENCE OF EVENTS:
            PRELUDE OR PROCESSIONAL HYMN
            OPENING STATEMENT OR PRAYER OR INVOCATION
            SCRIPTURE READING
            HYMN OR SPECIAL MUSIC
            EULOGY
            FINAL PRAYER OR BENEDICTION
            RECESSIONAL HYMN OR POSTLUDE
14.15. Remembrance Service
   14.15.1. General. The Remembrance Service differs from and should not be confused with a
   Memorial Service. A Remembrance Service is held to both remember and honor individuals
   or groups of fallen warriors associated with a particular date, location, battle or war, who at
   the time of their death were serving in an active duty capacity or as a Federal Government
   civilian. There is no set or specific sequence of events for a Remembrance Service. The
   Remembrance Service is usually convened by the installation commander, unit commander,
   chaplain staff, and in some cases, fraternal groups such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars
   (VFW), American Legion, Air Force Association (AFA) or Air Force Sergeant's Association
   (AFSA). There is an assumption that each individual or group of individuals had honors
   provided at the time of their death, do not perform funeral honors (rifle salute or presentation
   of the United States Flag) at a Remembrance Service. However, Taps may be played at the
   conclusion of the ceremony to signal, "take your rest." Funding may, or may not, be available
   and should be coordinated with the base Comptroller.
   14.15.2. Sample Sequence of Events. This is one example of Remembrance Service.
            SEQUENCE OF EVENTS:
            OPENING NARRATION
            PRESENTATION OF THE COLORS/ NATIONAL ANTHEM
            INVOCATION
            WELCOMING REMARKS
            HOMILY
            AIR FORCE HYMN or BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC
            READING OF HONOR ROLL (Fallen Members)

                                          Chapter 15

                                    SOCIAL FUNCTIONS

15.1. Seating Arrangements. Seating can be the key to the success ofan event. Rank
precedence forms the basis for making most seat assignments. However, common sense and the
comfort of guests must be considered. Be able to provide a clear rationale for seating
arrangements and ensure the host or hostess understands and approves the seat assignments and
in advance. See Attachment 2 for specific seating examples.
   15.1.1. The position of honor is always to the right of the hostess (or host at a stag event).
   This position is usually given to the most senior guest or the guest of honor. At large events,
   designate hosts at each table and spread out the senior attendees.
   15.1.2. When possible, seat men and women alternately. Avoid seating a civilian woman at
   the end or outer edge of a table; it may be necessary to seat two women next to each other.
   At some gatherings, it is acceptable to seat husbands and wives together, but at formal events
   seat them opposite each other.
   15.1.3. Round tables are preferable to rectangular tables since they offer more potential
   positions of honor and facilitate conversation.
   15.1.4. Seat speakers or anyone making introductions (including the Chaplain if an
   invocation is offered) as close to the podium as possible.
   15.1.5. Consider the placement of the host and distinguished guest(s) to ensure they can see
   and be seen by the audience.
   15.1.6. Strategically place interpreters when seating guests not fluent in English. Be
   sensitive to international customs and other unusual circumstances (e.g. personal security).
15.2. The Receiving Line. The word reception means the act of receiving or greeting. A
receiving line is a practical and efficient way to accomplish this greeting. In the Air Force,
receiving lines are frequently used to greet a new commander and spouse or to introduce a guest
of honor. Consider the following for a successful receiving line:
   15.2.1. The length of time for a receiving line is dependent on the desires of the host or guest
   of honor and the number of guests in the line.
   15.2.2. Station individuals in the receiving line single file according to the rules of
   precedence. The host (usually the commander) and his/her spouse are number one and
   number two. The guest of honor is next, if there is one, followed by his/her spouse, followed
   by the next honored guest in order of rank. Limit the receiving line to no more than five
   people. When a Chief of State is the guest of honor, the host and hostess relinquish their
   positions and the line forms with the Chief of State, his/her spouse, and followed by the host
   and hostess.
   15.2.3. Role of Announcer. If an announcer is used, the commander's aide or protocol
   officer acts to introduce guests. The announcer stands just to the side of the host and
   introduces the next guests in line. The announcer is not part of the receiving line and should
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                    77


  not shake hands with guests. The announcer's grasp of names should be quick and accurate,
  and pronunciation of names to the commander audible and distinct.
  15.2.4. "The Puller." Position a person just off the end of the receiving line to direct or
  ―pull‖ guests to refreshments or the lounge. This role is typically filled by a protocol staff
  member and plays a valuable part in preventing congestion at the end of the receiving line.
  15.2.5. Staffing the Receiving Line. Form the receiving line just before the appointed hour.
  Locate the line a sufficient distance from the entrance to facilitate easy movement of guests.
  Try to limit guests wait time to no more than12-15 minutes in line. If necessary, direct some
  guests to the refreshments and ask them to check the line later when it has thinned out. If
  guests insist on remaining in the receiving line, let them remain.
  15.2.6. Role of "Gatekeeper." Station a protocol person, familiar with the invited guests, at
  the entrance to the reception lounge, next to a table positioned for guests to place their drinks
  and food. Known as the "gatekeeper," this individual controls the flow of the receiving line.
  The gatekeeper ensures an orderly flow of guests by holding the line at the entrance until
  space clears for them to proceed. The gatekeeper also advises guests to place any drinks and
  food on the table provided before proceeding. Do not receive guests or go through a
  receiving line holding a drink or plate of food.
  15.2.7. Procedures for Guests Going Through the Receiving Line.
     15.2.7.1. Air Force. The invited individual should precede their spouse or guest through
     the line.
     15.2.7.2. Army. Ladies first at all functions except at the White House.
     15.2.7.3. Navy. Ladies first at all functions except at the White House.
     15.2.7.4. Place drinks and food on the table provided before entering the reception area.
     15.2.7.5. When going through the line, do not shake hands with the announcer. Provide
     your rank and last name (Major and Mrs. Smith), official title (Mayor and Mrs. Tom
     Jones) or name (Mr. and Mrs. Brown). Even if acquainted, guests should provide their
     name to the announcer/host.
     15.2.7.6. The announcer presents the guest to the host, who in turn presents him or her to
     the guest of honor. The guest, proceeding down the line, shakes hands and greets each
     person. Never engage in extended conversation in a receiving line. The purpose of a
     receiving line is for the host and guest of honor to receive their guests. The time for
     conversation is in the reception or event after the receiving line. Guests may repeat their
     names to members while proceeding down the receiving line.
  15.2.8. Physical Arrangements for Receiving Line. Consider the following guidelines for
  setting up a receiving line.
     15.2.8.1. Pick a location that allows easy movement of guests without crowding.
     15.2.8.2. The location should facilitate formation of guest line outside of receiving line
     room.
     15.2.8.3. Entry into the reception area where refreshments are located should be
     accessible from the end of the receiving line and from an area adjacent to the beginning
 78                                                        AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


       of the guest line (where the gatekeeper is positioned), without disturbing the natural flow
       of the guests.
       15.2.8.4. Make space available at the entrance to the receiving line room for a gatekeeper
       and table and guest book (optional).
       15.2.8.5. Position the receiving line so that direct sunlight does not distract either the
       guests or members of the receiving line.
       15.2.8.6. Place a table behind the receiving line. Consider pre-positioning a pitcher of
       ice water and glasses (or other refreshments) for members of the receiving line.
       15.2.8.7. Arrange flags behind the receiving line in accordance with flag etiquette. See
       AFI 34-1201, Chapter 2, for detailed information on flags.
15.3. Toasts. A toast is a gesture of honor rendered by the host to the guest of honor. The toast
usually begins with a welcome to the guest of honor; when accompanied by his/her spouse, both
may be referred to in the toast. Traditionally, only people are toasted, but it has become
acceptable to toast organizations or groups. Champagne is a favorite beverage for toasting, but
any wine is appropriate. Toasts are not offered with a mixed drink or after dinner liqueur.
Toasting with water is acceptable. Ensure glasses are charged with the appropriate beverage
prior to proposing a toast.
   15.3.1. Formal Toasts. Formal toasts are made: to the colors, to the heads of state of all
   countries represented (determined by seniority of international officers present), to the
   President of the United States, and to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and/or sister
   services. After the formal toasts, the host may ask everyone to sit and then toast the guests, if
   desired.
       15.3.1.1. At a formal occasion, the host initiates the toasting (Mr./Madam Vice at a
       dining in/out). Any guest may initiate the toasting when the occasion is informal. The
       subject of the toast is always based upon the type of occasion. Those offering a toast,
       man or woman, should stand and raise the glass to shoulder level in a salute while
       making the toast, then raise the glass above eye-level prior to drinking.
       15.3.1.2. The person being honored by the toast does not drink while he/she is being
       toasted. The honoree usually remains seated. After everyone sits down, the guest may
       rise and thank the host, offering a toast in return.
       15.3.1.3. All military members and civilian males should stand unless they are the
       recipients of the toast. They should hold glasses at shoulder level while the toast is being
       given, raise glasses above eye level when responding to the toast and then partake of the
       beverage.
       15.3.1.4. Nonmilitary females in attendance are not required to stand for a toast unless it
       is to the President of the United States, the U.S. flag, or if the wife of the host rises.
       Women may remain seated for any further informal toasts.
   15.3.2. Standard Toasts. Standard toasts are made "To your health," or "To success and
   happiness," while special occasions such as weddings or birthdays require toasts more
   specific in nature such as "To Mary and John for a lifetime of happiness and love" or "May
   your next 25 years be as happy and as successful as your first 25 years."
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                     79


  15.3.3. Ceremonial Toasts. When observing the formality of ceremonial toasts on formal
  occasions, arrange the order and subject of all toasts in advance. It is the responsibility of the
  host to inform the guest of honor which toasts will be offered and when; the host proposes all
  toasts and the guest answers in kind. The experienced guest is careful to leave enough
  beverage in his or her glass at the end of the meal to be able to join in several toasts.
     15.3.3.1. Always stand while drinking a toast to a Chief of State. The toast to the ruler
     of a country or the international guest of honor is always the first toast proposed on a
     formal occasion. A few minutes after the guests have seated themselves again, the senior
     representative of the country honored rises and proposes a toast to the rule of the host's
     country. All guests rise again to drink this toast.
     15.3.3.2. Initial toasts may be followed by others to the countries or the services
     represented by the guests, and/or to the guest of honor and the host. There may be brief
     speeches that fit the occasion. Other toasts may follow.
     15.3.3.3. Governments and titles change, verify accuracy in advance.
     15.3.3.4. The position is toasted, do not mention the individual's name.
  15.3.4. Toasts to International guests. When toasting international guests, the remarks may
  include the accomplishments of the guest of honor, ties between his/her country and the
  United States, and the hope and prospects for continued relationships. Often the historical
  background of the visitor's country is touched upon, especially with reference to former
  relationships with the United States. At the end of the remarks, the official giving the toasts
  will ask, "Will you stand and join me in a toast to ―His Excellency (name), President of
  (country)," or "His Excellency the President of (country)," or "The President of (country)."
  Substitute title of the guest of honor, with the correct usage, as given in the examples at the
  end of this section.
  15.3.5. Responses. Responses to toasts may range from a simple, "Hear, hear!" to a more
  complicated phrase. Please refer to the following partial listing of toasts for other examples.
          Toast: "To the Flag of the United States of America!"
          Response: "To the Colors!"
          Note: When used, this toast is always proposed first.
          Toast: "To Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second!"
          Response: "To Her Majesty!"
          Toast: "To Her Majesty Queen of Canada!"
          Response: "To Her Majesty!"
          Toast: "To His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Japan!"
          Response: "To the Emperor!"
          Toast: "To the President of the Republic of Korea!"
          Response: "To the President!"
          Toast: "To the President of the United States!"

          Response: "To the President!"
          Note: This toast applies only when more than one nation is represented.
          Toast: "To the Commander in Chief, The President of the United States!"
          Response: "To the President!"
 80                                                        AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


            Note: This toast applies when only the United States is represented. If no allied
            officers are present, the host proposes this toast.
   15.3.6. When proposing a toast to sister services, and only if members of those services are
   present, start with the most senior service as follows:
            Toast: "To the Chief of Staff of the United States Army!"
            Response: "To the Chief!"
            Toast: "To the Commandant of the Marine Corps!"
            Response: "To the Commandant"
            Toast: "To the Chief of Naval Operations!"
            Response: "To the Chief!"
            The most senior sister service representative present will then propose the toast to
            the Air Force Chief of Staff.
            Toast: "To the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force!"
            Response: "To the Chief!"
   15.3.7. Toast to Persons KIA, MIA or POW (always with water).
Toast: "We toast our hearty comrades who have fallen from the skies,
And were gently caught by God's own hands to be with him on high,
To dwell among the soaring clouds they have known so well before,
From victory roll to tail chase, at heaven's very door.
And as we fly among them, we're sure to hear their plea,
Take care, my friend, watch your six, and do one more roll for me.
To our comrades killed in action, missing in action, or prisoners of war!"
Response: Raise glass and partake of the beverage in silence.
15.4. Additional Factors.
   15.4.1. Hosting International Guests. Protocol is critically important when hosting,
   entertaining or interacting with international guests. Be knowledgeable about guests‘
   particular customs and traditions, to include dietary restrictions and hand or facial gestures.
   15.4.2. Smoking. In someone‘s home, never smoke without asking permission. In a
   club/restaurant, smoke only in a designated smoking section. Do not smoke at the table
   without the approval of the entire party.
15.4.3. Entertainment at Social Events. Many events can be enhanced with the addition of
live music. This can include background music during cocktails or dinner, or a performance
after dinner. Generally, a performance after dinner should be no more than 30 minutes. USAF
Bands provide a wide range of entertainment options.
15.5. Dinners.
   15.5.1. Dinner parties can be held in the host's home, a club, or a restaurant. Factors
   affecting the success of a dinner party include congenial guests, well-planned menu,
   attractive table, well-prepared food, gracious host and hostess, and competent and pleasant
   service personnel.
15.5.2. At formal dinner parties, guests are greeted at the entrance by aides or protocol
personnel. The host or hostess may stand near the door to the room to greet and welcome guests
or circulate within the room, greeting new arrivals as he or she can.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                    81


   15.5.3. The host leads the way in to dinner with the female guest of honor. If place cards are
   used, the hostess is usually the last to enter the dining room, along with the guest of honor.
   An exception to the host leading the way is a large dinner where the host and hostess and
   guests of honor (and sometimes everyone at the head table) are last to enter. In this situation,
   they are asked to wait in a side room and are brought in and announced/introduced by the
   master of ceremonies.
   15.5.4. When planning a dinner for guests from other parts of the country/world, consider
   going to restaurants with themes or menus unique to the local geographic area, taking any
   dietary restrictions into account. Conduct a site visit to the restaurant prior to organizing an
   event. Consider force protection concerns when coordinating with off-base venues.
15.6. Receptions. Receptions are usually formal affairs, a public or semi-public gathering in
honor of a prominent person or an important event. The most common type of official reception
is associated with a change of command, a promotion or a retirement.
   15.6.1. A receiving line is appropriate at most receptions.
   15.6.2. Arrange for some tables and chairs spread around the room to accommodate guests
   that cannot stand for long periods.
   15.6.3. If nametags are used, position the nametag table away from the receiving line to
   avoid congestion.
   15.6.4. Icebreakers. Icebreakers are traditionally held the first night of a meeting or
   conference. Keep the atmosphere informal; nametags are highly recommended.

                                           Chapter 16

                              DININGS IN AND DININGS OUT

16.1. Overview. Formal military dinners are a tradition in all branches of the United States
Armed services. In the Air Force and Navy, it is the dining in; in the Army, the regimental
dinner; in the Marine Corps and Coast Guard, mess night. The dining in and dining out represent
the most formal aspects of Air Force social life. Most of the information also applies to a
"combat" dining in and dining out. The dining in is a formal dinner for the members of a wing,
unit, or other organization. The "Combat dining in" is less formal due to the dress requirements
and informal atmosphere; however, the basic rules and format of the dining in apply. Dining in
ceremonies should be conducted in a tasteful, dignified manner. A dining in should have a
theme around which the decorations and ceremony are built. The dining out includes spouses
and guests.
16.2. Background.
   16.2.1. Many of our customs, traditions, and procedures are traceable to the earliest warriors.
   The dining in is one such military tradition that has its roots in the shadows of antiquity. The
   pre-Christian Roman Legions probably began the dining in tradition. Roman military
   commanders frequently held great banquets to honor individuals and military units. These
   gatherings were victory celebrations where past feats were remembered and booty of recent
   conquests paraded. The second century Viking war lords stylized the format of the victory
   feast. With the exception of the lookout, or watch, the entire clan attended these
   celebrations. Feats of strength and skill were performed to entertain members and guests.
   The leader took his place at the head of the table, with all others to his right and left in
   descending order of rank.
   16.2.2. The dining in custom was transplanted to ancient England by Roman and Viking
   warriors. King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table practiced a form of dining in during the
   sixth century. The tradition eventually spread to non-military groups, such as the Saxon
   nobles of the tenth century and the medieval monasteries. The monks, who followed a more
   rigid regimen, had their form of dining in as an integral part of monastic life. The clergy
   spread the custom to the academies and universities. The British officer corps, with many
   graduates of these centers of learning, carried the tradition back to military units. The dining
   in became increasingly formalized after the first officers' mess was established. It is said that
   in early 1800s, when England was the reigning power in India, it was an English army post
   where the dining in received renewed impetus.
   16.2.3. The commander of this Indian outpost had officers under his command who lived on
   the post and had their own mess hall, but were never around for dinner. Since the local area
   was more interesting than the post officers' mess, the post commander found himself eating
   alone many nights. To bring the officers back to the mess and to create camaraderie, the post
   commander instituted a program whereby all officers would not only dine at least once a
   month in the mess, but they would dine in full military ceremony.
   16.2.4. Many early American customs and traditions were British in origin and the military
   was no exception. British Army and Navy units deployed to the wilderness of America
   brought with them the social customs and traditions of their service to include the formal
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                     83


   military dinner referred to as guest night. This pleasant custom provided an opportunity for
   officers to gather for an evening of good food, drinking, and fellowship.
   16.2.5. British naval, land, and air units are still active enthusiasts of the dining in. Many
   units reportedly hold at least one such function monthly. Some British messes still call the
   occasion guest night, while others refer to it as dining in night or band night.
   16.2.6. In establishing an independent nation, America's founders borrowed much of the
   military structure of their adversary, including social customs. The United States‘ dining in
   tradition was borrowed from the English by George Washington's Continentals. Despite the
   colonists' aversion to anything suggesting the Redcoat, Continental naval and army officers
   must have fully realized the value of these occasions in the promotion of pride of service,
   high morale, and loyalty.
   16.2.7. In the pioneer era of military aviation, the late General H. H. "Hap" Arnold is
   reported to have held famous parties called Wing-Dings at March Field in 1933, inaugurating
   the first of these occasions.
   16.2.8. The long association of U.S. Army Air Force officers with the British during World
   War II surely stimulated increased American interest in the dining in custom. At Royal Air
   Force stations throughout Great Britain during World War II, the officers' mess was as
   popular with Army Air Force officers as it had been with the British for nearly a century and
   a half. As a place to seek leisure in off-duty hours, the officers' mess facilitated high spirits
   and practical joking. Through close association with British officers, the dining in increased
   in popularity among Army Air Force officers.
   16.2.9. While the association of British and American officers during World War II brought
   the format and protocol of the Army Air Force dining in custom more in line with the
   English tradition, the war years also proved to be the high point of dining in popularity.
   After the war, Air Force dinings in steadily declined in frequency until the late 1950s. The
   decline may have been caused by postwar demobilization, transition of the Army Air Force
   to the U.S. Air Force, the occupation and reconstruction of Germany and Japan, the Korean
   War, the deep economic recession following Korea, and other factors diverting attention
   from military social functions. Then, beginning in 1958, there was a conscious effort to
   rejuvenate the USAF dining in tradition.
   16.2.10. Despite the obstacles of the twentieth century, the tradition of dining in continues.
   The Navy and Air Force call this social affair the dining in. The Marine Corps and the Coast
   Guard refer to it as mess night; the Army refers to it as the regimental dinner. Veterans
   remember and revive the tradition at every opportunity. They recognize the important role
   these occasions play in preserving the traditions of the services.
16.3. Purpose. The dining in is occasion for officers to meet socially at a formal military
function. It enhances the esprit of units, lightens the load of demanding day-to-day work, gives
the commander an opportunity to meet socially with subordinates, and enables military members
of all ranks to create bonds of friendship and better working relations through an atmosphere of
fellowship. The dining in also provides a means of saying farewell to departing members,
welcoming newly arrived members and forum to recognize individual and unit achievements.

16.4. Dining in. The dining in is a formal dinner for the members of a wing, unit, or
organization. Although a dining in is traditionally a unit function, attendance by other smaller
units may be appropriate.
16.5. Dining out. The dining out is a relatively new custom that includes spouses and guests. It
is similar in all other respects to a dining in.
16.6. Combat Dining in. The combat dining in, the newest of the dining in traditions, is
popular in operational units. The format and sequence of events is built around the traditional
dining in. The atmosphere and dress requirements are far less formal (flight-suits, ABUs, etc.).
16.7. Attendance. Traditionally, attendance at a dining in was mandatory and many
commanders still consider this function a mandatory requirement, similar to a Commander's
Call. The decision whether a dining in is voluntary or mandatory rests with the commander.
16.8. Guests of the Mess. There are two types of guests, official guests and personal guests.
Official guests are honored guests of the mess. The guest speaker is an official guest. All
official guests are seated at the head table and their expenses are shared by the members of the
mess. Due to costs and space at the head table, limit the number of official guests.
   16.8.1. Personal guests may be either military members or civilians (for dinings out). They
   are not seated at the head table, and their expenses are paid by the sponsoring member.
   16.8.2. To enhance relationships, consider senior officers from other units and organizations
   and civic leaders from the local community when inviting guests.
   16.8.3. Mess members should arrive at least ten minutes before the hour of invitation in
   order to meet and talk with the guests of honor and get acquainted with others. Members do
   not leave until the guests depart unless excused in advance.
16.9. Dress. Officers wear the mess dress uniform. Male civilians should wear appropriate
black tie dinner dress or a dark suit. Clearly identify the proper dress for civilians in the
invitation. Retired officers may wear the mess dress or civilian attire. For enlisted members,
mess dress or the semi-formal dress uniform is worn. Refer to AFI 36-2903, for guidance on
wear.
   16.9.1. Long dinner dresses or evening clothes for female guests are appropriate when
   attending a dining out.
   16.9.2. Pregnant military women should wear appropriate military attire.
16.10. Key Players.
   16.10.1. President. This officer is the center figure of the dining in. Normally the
   commander of the organization hosting the dining in, the president is charged with the
   overall responsibility of the dining in. Specific duties of the president are as follows:
       16.10.1.1. Oversee entire organization and operation of the dining in.
       16.10.1.2. Appoint any or all of the following project officers:
           16.10.1.2.1. Vice President
           16.10.1.2.2. Arrangements Officer
           16.10.1.2.3. Mess Officer
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                    85


         16.10.1.2.4. Escort Officers
     16.10.1.3. Secure an appropriate speaker, set the date, and determine location.
     16.10.1.4. Arrange for a chaplain to give the invocation.
     16.10.1.5. Greet all guests before dinner is served.
     16.10.1.6. Opening and closing of the mess.
     16.10.1.7. Many of the duties of the president are delegated to the arrangements officer
     who works closely with the president to ensure the success of the dining in.
  16.10.2. Vice President. The vice president serves as the president's principal assistant. The
  vice president is traditionally the junior officer of the mess; however, the president may
  select another member to serve in this demanding position. The success of the evening
  hinges largely on the imagination and humor of this individual who stimulates table
  conversation and keeps the program moving. The vice president also notes and makes
  special mention of the violations of the rules of the mess and breaches of protocol and
  etiquette. Traditionally, the vice president sits alone at the back of the dining room facing the
  president in order to observe the proceedings and monitor the flow of the program; the vice
  president is never seated near or at the head table. It is essential that mister/madam vice be
  very familiar with the customs and traditions of the mess. Duties of the vice president
  include:
     16.10.2.1. Open the lounge at the appointed time.
     16.10.2.2. Sound the dinner chimes at the appropriate time.
     16.10.2.3. Prepare appropriate toasts as directed by the president. Composition of
     appropriate poems or witticisms (in good taste) relating to personalities and (or)
     organizations present is encouraged.
     16.10.2.4. Keep the party moving and is the last person to leave.
  16.10.3. Arrangements Officer. The arrangements officer is directly responsible to the
  commander for the comprehensive planning of the dining in and for attending to the
  numerous details required for a successful event. The person selected for this task should be
  a top planner and supervisor. In small units, a junior officer may be capable of filling this
  role, but in large units, an officer with more seniority and experience may be a better choice.
  The arrangements officer works closely with the president to determine the date and location,
  and to identify and invite the guest speaker. He or she is also responsible for the menu,
  seating, decorations, music and entertainment, lodging and reservations, invitations, and the
  agenda. The arrangements officer consults with the president before making any final
  decisions on key aspects of the event. Other duties of the arrangements officer include:
     16.10.3.1. Establish the correct table and seating arrangement and arrange the necessary
     name and organization card; consider seating by organization, or by grade.
     16.10.3.2. Putting flags and any awards in place before the opening of the lounge, unless
     posting of the colors is part of the planned ceremony.
     16.10.3.3. Arrange for a suitable public address system (usually furnished by the club).

     and content are determined by the president.
     16.10.3.9. Brief the senior Allied military member scheduled to attend on the proper
     toast to be made to the President of the United States.
     16.10.3.10. Reproduce biographical sketches of guests as required.
     16.10.3.11. Ensure a hat/coat checker is available.
     16.10.3.12. After the dining in, prepare letters of appreciation to the guest of honor and
     others who rendered service for the president's signature.
  16.10.4. Mess Officer. The mess officer is an optional player in the dining in/dining out.
  Once the preliminary decision about event facility is made, the arrangements officer can
  delegate some or all of the responsibilities associated with the dining facility to the mess
  officer.
  16.10.5. Protocol Officer.
     16.10.5.1. Send formal invitations to all guests at least four weeks prior to the event.
     16.10.5.2. Establish procedures for taking R.s.v.p.‘s
     16.10.5.3. Make necessary lodging arrangements.

  Duties of the escort officer include:
     16.10.6.1. Contact the guest in advance to discuss dress, location, meeting point, and
     composition of the audience.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                     87


       16.10.6.2. If the guests are from out of town, meet them at their initial arrival point and
       arrange for transportation and accommodations during their stay.
       16.10.6.3. Meet and escort the guest into the lounge.
       16.10.6.4. Brief the guest on the customs, courtesies, and procedures of the dining in.
       16.10.6.5. Make sure that the guest is properly introduced to the president of the mess,
       other guests, the guest speaker, and members of the mess.
       16.10.6.6. Ensure the guest is always in the company of several members of the mess;
       ensure no individual or group monopolizes the guest.
       16.10.6.7. Upon departure, escort the guest to point of departure and bid farewell on
       behalf of all members of the mess.
   16.10.7. Guest Speaker. The guest speaker's presentation is the traditional highlight of the
   evening. By custom, the speaker should be distinguished as either a military officer or
   official of the government. Contact the speaker well in advance and advised of the nature of
   the evening. When introducing the guest speaker to the mess, leave no doubt in the guests'
   minds whether they are to acknowledge the introduction to preclude possible embarrassment.
   Keep the introduction of the guest speaker simple; the speaker's ability will be evident.
16.11. Planning Considerations. Start early, three to four months in advance, set a firm date,
location, and general action plan. Appoint a planning committee chaired by the arrangements
officer.
   16.11.1. Committee Membership. The size of the committee depends on the magnitude of
   the function. Committee members must be motivated and action oriented. Select committee
   members with expertise in their area of responsibility. Potential committee members
   include:
       16.11.1.1. Recorder.
       16.11.1.2. Finance.
       16.11.1.3. Invitations and Reservations.
       16.11.1.4. Food and Beverage.
       16.11.1.5. Decorations.
       16.11.1.6. Publicity.
   16.11.2. Date and Location. Selecting a date and location for the dining in is step 1. First,
   set a tentative date. If the committee has a guest speaker in mind, informally check the
   individual's availability. Make sure the date does not conflict with other military
   commitments, such as deployments, inspections or major base social function. Once a
   tentative date is set, choose a tentative location. Location is usually the officers' club for a
   dining in and dining out. Depending on circumstance, another location may be suitable, such
   as an aircraft hanger for a combat dining in. If the preferred location is available, book it
   immediately. If considering off-base sites, ensure the prospective caterer is willing and able
   to meet requirements. Have a thorough understanding of all provisions of any contract
   before signing it. Pay particular attention to the cancellation clauses and cost factors (i.e.
   whether or not quoted prices include tax and gratuity).
88                                                         AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


  16.11.3. Choosing a Guest Speaker. Carefully choose the guest speaker. Traditionally, the
  speaker is a high-ranking military officer or government official. The arrangements officer
  usually prepares the letter of invitation for the president's signature; include the date,
  location, describe the audience and other pertinent facts about the occasion. It is appropriate
  to suggest suitable topics and desired length for the speech. Identify a potential alternate
  speaker in case the speaker of choice cancels.
  16.11.4. Invitations to Senior Officials. Coordinate with the appropriate level commander
  before sending invitations to senior officials, such as the SecDef and Principal Deputies,
  Service Secretaries, and Service Chiefs, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
  and other high ranking military and government civilian DVs.
  16.11.5. Other Invitations. Send formal invitations to all guests, official and personal,
  extended in the name of the president. Invitations are not usually sent to members of the
  mess.
  16.11.6. Place Cards and "YASA" Cards. Place cards are required only at the head table;
  organization identification cards are appropriate at other tables. Use one card for each table
  (uniform in size, color, and lettering). With assigned seating, utilize "YASA" cards with
  accompanying seating arrangement board to help members find their seat. Remove table
  numbers after the mess is assembled and first dinner course is served.
  16.11.7. Music. Schedule the band (consider a military band or ensemble) through the
  installation public affairs office. If a suitable band is unavailable, consider either a taped
  program or no music at all.
  16.11.8. Menu. The traditional menu consisted of four or five courses, with roast prime rib
  of beef and Yorkshire pudding. In recent years, the standard dinner at a dining in includes
  salad, entree, and dessert. While appetizers and soups may be easily added, a larger menu
  means increased costs; portions of large meals often go uneaten.
  16.11.9. Wine. Wine is an integral part of the dining in both for adding to the meal and for
  toasting. The wine is served in carafes by wait staff or simply placed on the table and passed
  around, from left to right (counterclockwise). Provide an alternative non-alcoholic beverage
  for those not wishing to drink wine, with refills readily available.
  16.11.10. Seating. Table arrangements for a dining in include straight banquet style, ―T‖,
  ―U‖, or modified ―E‖ formations; consider ease of passage and space between place settings
  when choosing the best arrangement; avoid crowding tables. To allow the president and
  mister/madam vice to face each other when speaking, place mister/madam vice‘s table at the
  opposite end of the banquet hall directly facing the president. Seat the head table according
  to protocol, with the senior honored guest to the right of the president, the next senior person
  to the left of the president, etc. The senior honored guest is usually the guest speaker. If this
  is not the case, it is customary to informally ask the senior honored guest if he or she will
  cede that position to the guest speaker. Do not seat guests at the ends of a table. Table
  seating for a dining out requires a man woman-alternating pattern within protocol restraints.
  Seat spouses in precedence determined by their military member's grade; spouses are not
  seated together. Refrain from seating two women next to each other except to avoid seating
  a civilian woman at the end of the table. If seated at the head table, the chaplain often sits on
  the far left of the president. At a dining out, the guest of honor's wife is seated to the right of
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                 89


  the president with the second-ranking woman to his left. The president's wife is seated to the
  right of the guest of honor. Seat other guests throughout the mess and seat members of the
  mess according to seniority. Seat organizations at tables arranged in accordance with local
  protocol or custom; consider the ability of the head table to clearly see all members of the
  mess. Do not just consider the mess member's ability to see the head table. Refer to
  Attachment 2 for depictions of seating arrangements.
  16.11.11. Decorations. Decorations fall into two categories, tables and the dining
  room/lounge. Limit table decorations to floral centerpieces and silver candelabra; formal
  organizational decorations may also be appropriate. The silver is provided by the caterer
  (club) while the centerpieces must be ordered from a florist. Order flowers at least one week
  in advance. Identify a budget and allow the florist to work around that amount. Dining room
  and lounge decorations include seals, emblems, flags, and colors tastefully displayed. When
  in doubt, keep the theme of the decorations patriotic.
  16.11.12. Program. A printed program booklet is not required, but may provide the dining
  in with a touch of class. The printed program is usually 5¼ by 8½ inches in size. Consider
  dressing up the booklet with quality paper stock, graphic art and variations in typeface. The
  president of the mess should approve a sample prior to printing. One booklet is usually
  positioned at each place setting. Contents of the program may include:
     16.11.12.1. Welcome letter from the commander.
     16.11.12.2. History of the dining in.
     16.11.12.3. Background, tradition, or explanation of locally originated ceremonies held
     as part of the dining in.
     16.11.12.4. Agenda.
     16.11.12.5. Schedule of, and proper responses to, toasts.
     16.11.12.6. Biography and photograph of the guest speaker.
     16.11.12.7. Biography and photograph of the commander.
     16.11.12.8. History of the sponsoring organization.
     16.11.12.9. Menu.
     16.11.12.10. "Rules of the Mess."
     16.11.12.11. Words to the Air Force Hymn or Air Force Song.
     16.11.12.12. Brief description of awards and recipients.
  16.11.13. Financial Planning. Estimating all costs and determining the pro-rata cost charged
  to each member of the mess is critical for a successful event. Consider the following:
     16.11.13.1. Unit military personnel customarily pay their own way and share the expense
     of all formally invited guests. Clearly designate the funding status of personnel outside
     the sponsoring organization in the invitation. Wording such as "come join us" followed
     with an estimate of the cost connotes a paying member. Use of the word "guest" in the
     invitation indicates a formal guest of the sponsoring unit without a requirement to pay.
     As a formal guest, the guest speaker does not pay. To defray the cost for junior enlisted
 90                                                       AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


      personnel, consider donations from private organizations or a multi-tiered price structure
      applied according to grade. Consult the legal office before accepting funds from private
      organizations.
      16.11.13.2. A dining in at reasonable cost to each member is usually more enjoyable
      than an expensive extravaganza.
      16.11.13.3. Once tentative costs are determined, develop an operating budget.
      16.11.13.4. Establish a procedure for collecting and depositing money such as a separate
      bank account specifically for the function. For a large function, identify POCs in
      elements of the unit to take reservations and collect money or club card numbers from
      their assigned unit.
   16.11.14. Bartenders. During the cocktail hour, ensure a sufficient number of bartenders are
   available. To eliminate a long bar line, consider starting the evening with extra bartenders at
   each bar, but be aware that this may increase the cost. Discuss options with club
   management or the caterer. Suggested number of bars required:
      16.11.14.1. 1-50 people: 1 bar
      16.11.14.2. 51-100 people: 2 bars
      16.11.14.3. 100-500 people: 3 or more bars
      16.11.14.4. Non-alcoholic beverages should available at each bar.
   16.11.15. Chaplain. Invite a chaplain to give the invocation. If a chaplain is not available, a
   member of the mess may give the invocation.
   16.11.16. Photography. Brief the photographer on the agenda of events in advance. Identify
   the specific photographs desired and clarify any requirements. The photographer should not
   detract from ceremonies or activities. If necessary, stage photos before or after the event. If
   desired, arrange a private professional photographer for personal photographs of the
   members of the mess.
   16.11.17. Memento for the Speaker. The memento for the guest speaker, if provided, should
   be of nominal value. A plaque commemorating the occasion or the gavel used by the
   president of the mess is acceptable.
   16.11.18. Site Inspection. Check the site thoroughly on the day of the event with assistance
   from committee members and make adjustments or corrections as appropriate.
16.12. Conducting the Dining in.
   16.12.1. Conduct and Courtesies. Urge members to meet as many guests as time permits
   without monopolizing the time of any one guest. The following is a step-by-step sequence of
   the dining in, from arrival to adjournment.
   16.12.2. Cocktails. Member of the mess should arrive in the lounge within 10 minutes of
   opening time and prior to the senior honored guest. The cocktail period usually lasts between
   30 and 60 minutes. This time is intended for members to assemble before dinner and meet
   the guests. Escort officers should remain with guests while members rotate between guests.
   Light snacks such as nuts, chips, and pretzels may be strategically located throughout the
   lounge. Soft, classical or semi-classical background music is appropriate (recorded or live).
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                 91


  16.12.3. Assembling for Dinner. At the end of the cocktail period, mister/madam vice
  sounds the dinner chime and directs the mess to proceed to the dining room. Members and
  guests assigned to the head table remain in the lounge or assemble in an anteroom. All others
  proceed in an orderly fashion to assigned seats and stand quietly behind their chairs. By
  tradition, drinks are never taken into the dining room. There are several entry options for
  members of the head table.
     16.12.3.1. The president and guest of honor enter first with the president on the left and
     the honored guest on his/her right. Continue with the next ranking individual on the left
     and next ranking official guest on his/her right-hand and so forth.
     16.12.3.2. Table members file in to the dining area in the order they will be seated at the
     table, far end of the platform from entrance steps first, with those seated closest to the
     platform steps last. This order of entry works well when the platform the head table is
     placed on is narrow and does not allow members room to pass behind one another.
     16.12.3.3. The president and guest of honor enter the mess last after everyone is
     assembled.
     16.12.3.4. Once the head table is in place, "Ruffles and Flourishes" and the "General's
     March" are played as appropriate if the senior member is a general officer. All members
     of the mess stand at attention during the playing of ―Ruffles and Flourishes.‖
  16.12.4. Calling the Mess to Order. Immediately following the sounding of "Ruffles and
  Flourishes," the president raps the gavel once to call the mess to order. The president then
  directs the color guard to post the colors. The color guard marches into the dining room and
  posts the colors. The national anthem is then played or sung. If the colors are in place, or
  there is no color guard, the national anthem is played or sung immediately following the
  president's call to order. A bugler may sound "To The Color" instead of the national anthem.
  Following the national anthem, the color guard departs the room. Since protocol does not
  require that the colors, once posted, must be retired, some commanders elect to dismiss the
  color guard at this time. After the color guard departs, the president asks the chaplain or an
  appointed member of the mess to deliver the invocation. After the invocation, the members
  of the mess and guests remain standing for the toasting.
  16.12.5. Wine Pouring Ceremony. Usually, wineglasses are already filled; but if a wine
  pouring ceremony is observed, members of the mess and guests will be seated immediately
  following the invocation. The president removes the stopper from the decanter placed before
  him/her; the senior officer at each table does likewise following the president's lead.
  Decanters are passed from hand to hand to the right, with each member filling his or her
  glass. Decanters never touch the table until all glasses are filled and the president replaces
  the stopper and places the decanter on the table. Club service personnel should be ready to
  replace decanters as they are emptied, and to fill wine goblets with a non-alcoholic beverage
  as appropriate. According to tradition, port wine is used for toasting while another wine is
  used for dinner. The choice of wines is a commander's prerogative. When all glasses are
  charged, and the president has replaced the decanter on the table, all members of the mess
  and guests rise for the toasts.
92                                                       AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


  16.12.6. Other Ceremonies. Other ceremonies may be used instead of, or in conjunction
  with, the opening ceremony (i.e. a sword ceremony). Keep ceremonies simple, well
  rehearsed and limit to no more than one or two, to keep the evening's events on schedule.
  16.12.7. Toasting. In addition to general rules covered in Chapter 15 of this publication, the
  following apply specifically to a dining in or dining out.
     16.12.7.1. Informal toasts are an important part of the occasion. They should be
     humorous, but in good taste. Utilize "plants" to make some impromptu toasts to set the
     tone of the evening.
     16.12.7.2. After the welcoming remarks, the president introduces the head table, and
     mister/madam vice proposes a toast, "To our honored guests." The guests respond,
     "Here, Here."
     16.12.7.3. Normally, toasts are planned and approved in advance by the president. To
     avoid confusion, print the toasts and responses in the dining in program booklets placed
     at the tables. However, at any time after the toast to the Chief of Staff, a member may
     ask to be recognized by saying, "mister/madam vice, I have a point of order."
     Mister/madam vice recognizes the member by saying, "Sir/Madam, state your point of
     order." The member will, in a polite and forthright manner, advise the president that the
     toast required by courtesy or protocol has not been proposed. The president then requests
     the member who has the floor to propose the toast or asks mister/madam vice to propose
     the appropriate toast. (This is an opportune time for the president of the mess to explain
     the POW/MIA table and propose his last toast ("One more roll") before his/her opening
     remarks.)
  16.12.8. President's Opening Remarks. The president's remarks provide the opportunity to
  officially welcome guests and set the tone for the evening. After the head table is introduced,
  the president either personally introduces the remaining guests or polls the escort officers.
  Once all guests are recognized, mister/madam vice proposes a toast to the guests. Members
  of the mess stand, guests remain seated. The response to this and all future toasts is, "Hear,
  Hear!" The president then seats the mess and invites the members to eat. Courses are served
  to the head table first. At other tables, the highest-ranking individuals are served first.
  Mister/madam vice is served immediately after the head table. Before serving the entree, the
  president may wish to add some humor to the meal by asking mister/madam vice to sample
  the meal. The vice president may choose to compose an ode or poem to the meal.
  16.12.9. Recess. At the scheduled time, the president raps the gavel three times to gain
  attention. When the mess is silent, the president raps twice and announces a short recess
  allowing dishes to be cleared and dessert served. Members stand by their places until the
  head table departs. Everyone then proceeds to the cocktail lounge where the bars have
  reopened.
  16.12.10. Reconvening the Mess. At the end of the recess, mister/madam vice sounds the
  dinner chimes and directs everyone to proceed to the dining room. Traditionally, drinks are
  not brought into the dining room following the recess. When members reach their places,
  they stand directly behind their chairs. The president leads the head table party into the
  dining room. The president then seats the mess with one rap of the gavel. Coffee and tea are
  served and dessert is eaten.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                   93


  16.12.11. Awards. If individual or unit achievements are recognized, an appropriate
  ceremony is arranged. The ceremony takes place during the formal portion, often
  immediately preceding the guest of honor's speech. A toast to those recognized is
  appropriate. It is inappropriate to plan a ceremony directly after the guest speaker's speech.
  16.12.12. Guest Speaker's Address. After recognition and awards, and any scheduled
  entertainment, the president introduces the guest speaker. The speaker's address (usually
  patriotic or entertaining in nature) typically lasts 15 to 20 minutes. After thanking the
  speaker, the president presents a memento to the speaker. The president then asks the vice
  president to propose an appropriate toast to the guest speaker. Mister/madam vice proposes a
  toast, "To our guest of honor."
  16.12.13. Closing the Mess. After the toast to the guest speaker, the president recognizes
  those who organized the dining in and thanks mister/madam vice. If desired, the colors are
  retired by the color guard. The president encourages everyone to stay and enjoy him or
  herself, if post-dinner entertainment is planned, and then adjourns the mess with two raps of
  the gavel. After the mess is adjourned, members remain at the dining in until the guest of
  honor and the president depart. If there is a delay in departure, the president may allow
  members to leave at their discretion. Traditionally, mister/madam vice is the last member to
  leave the dining in.
  16.12.14. Post Dinner Entertainment. Post dinner entertainment depends upon the
  imagination of the sponsoring unit, the arrangements officer and the vice president, within
  the guidelines set by the president. At the close of a dining out, an orchestra, band, or DJ for
  dancing may be appropriate entertainment.
  16.12.15. The Grog Bowl.
     16.12.15.1. The grog bowl is an "accessory" traditional to a dining in, although not
     required. If a grog bowl is not utilized, consider some other means of punishment for
     infractions.
     16.12.15.2. The planning committee determines the contents of the grog bowl. It is
     permissible to have two grog bowls, one alcoholic and one non-alcoholic.
     16.12.15.3. Consider a grog mixing ceremony where the contents of the grog are
     combined along with a humorous narrative by mister/madam vice.
     16.12.15.4. Certain members of the mess seem to be frequent violators, such as
     mister/madam vice. It is not uncommon for the president and the guest speaker to be
     charged with at least one violation. If the president leaves his/her position at the head
     table, he/she must appoint another individual to assume his/her position.
     16.12.15.5. The arrangement officer or mister/madam vice, should brief the president on
     the rules beforehand (refresh his/her memory) and determine the "rules of engagement"
     to keep this portion of the program from getting out of hand.
     16.12.15.6. Infractions warranting a trip to the grog bowl are noted at any time by the
     president, vice president, or any member of the mess. Members bring infractions to the
     attention of the president by raising a point of order. If the validity of the charge is
     questioned, members vote by tapping their spoons on the table.
 94                                                      AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


      16.12.15.7. When the president directs a violator to the grog bowl, the individual
      proceeds to the bowl promptly. The bowl is usually located on mister/madam vice's
      table. Upon arriving at the grog bowl, the violator does the following:
          16.12.15.7.1. Does an about face and salutes the president.
          16.12.15.7.2. Turns to the bowl and fills the cup.
          16.12.15.7.3. Does another about face and toasts the mess.
          16.12.15.7.4. Drains the contents of the cup without removing it from the lips, then
          places it inverted on his/her head signifying it is empty.
          16.12.15.7.5. Replaces the cup, again salutes the president, and returns to his/her
          seat. With the exception of the toast, "To the Mess," the violator is not permitted to
          speak during this process.
      16.12.15.8. At various points during the evening, a member may be sent to the grog bowl
      as punishment for violating the ―rules of the mess‖ (outlined in paragraph 16.13). The
      following provides additional examples of common violations of protocol warranting a
      trip to the grog bowl include:
      16.12.15.9. Common Violations of Protocol Warranting a Trip to the Grog Bowl.
          16.12.15.9.1. Wearing an ill-fitting or discolored mess jacket.
          16.12.15.9.2. Wearing non-issue suspenders.
          16.12.15.9.3. Starting a course before the president.
          16.12.15.9.4. Applauding a particularly witty, sarcastic, or succinct toast (unless
          following the example of the president).
          16.12.15.9.5. Loud and obtrusive remarks
          16.12.15.9.6. Discussing business, referred to as "opening the hangar doors."
          16.12.15.9.7. Leaving the dining area without permission from the president.
          16.12.15.9.8. Talking while another person has the floor.
          16.12.15.9.9. Quibbling.
          16.12.15.9.10. Haggling over date of rank.
16.13. Rules of the Mess. The following outlines rules under which the mess is conducted.
They are designed to conform to tradition and promote levity. Violators of these rules are
subject to the wrath and mischievousness of mister/madam vice. All assigned penalties are
carried out before the membership.
   16.13.1. Thou shalt arrive within 10 minutes of the appointed hour.
   16.13.2. Thou shalt make every effort to meet all guests.
   16.13.3. Thou shalt move to the mess when thee hears the chimes and remain standing until
   seated by the president.
   16.13.4. Thou shalt not bring cocktails or lighted smoking material into the mess.
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                    95


   16.13.5. Thou shalt not leave the mess whilst convened. Military protocol overrides all calls
   of nature.
   16.13.6. Thou shalt participate in all toasts unless thyself or thy group is honored with a
   toast.
   16.13.7. Thou shalt ensure that thy glass is always charged when toasting.
   16.13.8. Thou shalt keep toasts and comments within the limits of good taste and mutual
   respect. Degrading or insulting remarks will be frowned upon by the membership.
   However, good natured needling is encouraged.
   16.13.9. Thou shalt not murder the Queen's English.
   16.13.10. Thou shalt not open the hangar doors.
   16.13.11. Thou shalt always use the proper toasting procedure.
   16.13.12. Thou shalt fall into disrepute with thy peers if the pleats of thy cummerbund are
   not properly faced.
   16.13.13. Thou shalt also be painfully regarded if thy clip-on bow tie rides at an obvious list.
   Thou shalt be forgiven; however, it thee also ride at a comparable list.
   16.13.14. Thou shalt consume thy meal in a manner becoming gentlepersons.
   16.13.15. Thou shalt not laugh at ridiculously funny comments unless the president first
   shows approval by laughing.
   16.13.16. Thou shalt express thy approval by tapping thy spoon on the table. Clapping of
   thy hands will not be tolerated.
   16.13.17. Thou shalt not question the decisions of the president.
   16.13.18. When the mess adjourns, thou shalt rise and wait for the president and head table
   guests to leave.
   16.13.19. Thou shalt enjoy thyself to thy fullest.
16.14. A Final Word. Various forms of skits or entertainment may also be included to add to
the evening. The decorations, ceremony, humor, and wit contribute to the memory of the
evening. A memorable event does not need to be excessively costly or lengthy, prepare an
agenda and stick to the schedule. A formal program that lasts between 2 and 2 1/2 hours is ideal,
allowing sufficient time for informal entertainment.

Note: For additional seating arrangement examples, refer to the Protocol Manager‘s pages of the
Air Force Services Portal at: https://www.usafservices.com/Managers/Protocol.aspx
A2.1. Seating can be the key to the success of an event or conference. After the guest list is
compiled, it is then used for seating arrangements.

Figure A2.1. Mixed Circular Table for Ten – Equal Male and Female




Figure A2.2. Mixed Circular Table for Eight – Equal Male and Female




Note: The 1st Lady is seated to the left of the host, rather than the traditional seat of honor at the
host‘s right. Seating in this fashion will ensure guests are seated next to the hostess, and prevent
side-by-side seating of husbands and wives. Apply this arrangement when table seating is in
multiples of four (e.g. 4, 8, 12, 16, etc. places). With the table seating for any number of other
than a multiple of four guests, traditional methods apply.

Note: (Figures A2.9 and A2.10): Military adage of ―placing rank to the right‖ is applied
differently in seating. The ranking position in seating is that of the host. Guidelines: Host is
seated at position number 1. The position of honor is to the right of the host, so the next ranking

individual or guest of honor will be seated in position #2. If the event is a briefing to senior
leaders with no obvious host, then the senior person sits at position #1 and the next ranking
person sits in position #2. The rest of the attendees are seated in rank or precedence orders back
and forth down the table. If the host wants to give his/her seat to a ranking person or guest of
honor out of courtesy, the host will then sit in position #2.

                                 ESCORT OFFICER GUIDE

A5.1. Distinguished Visitors (DV). This guide outlines primary responsibilities for escort
officers and represents the "norm" in terms of usual procedures. Occasionally, a DV visit will
involve unusual circumstances requiring both flexibility and adaptability. Design a plan based
on known information and the advice of the project officer.
A5.2. Making Contact.
   A5.2.1. The protocol officer in charge of the event will provide escorts with the DV's name,
   grade, organization, position, office telephone number and biography on the DV.
   Arrival/departure, lodging, and transportation information may also be provided. Exchange
   contact information with both the protocol and project officers.
   A5.2.2. Call the DV's office. The escort should introduce him or herself to the DV's
   secretary, executive officer and/or Aide-de-camp.
   A5.2.3. The escort officer should indicate who is calling why he or she is calling ("I have
   been appointed as the escort officer for Gen XXX for X event, and wanted to introduce
   myself, as well as talk about the DV's plans and requirements").
   A5.2.4. Leave full name, rank, and telephone number(s) with the DV's office
   A5.2.5. Obtain the correct phonetic pronunciation and spelling of the DV's name.
   A5.2.6. Double check flight numbers, arrival and departure times, and transportation
   requirements (MilAir, Commercial Air, Rental Car, etc.); protocol handles lodging
   reservations, but confirm if the information is available. Do not assume the DV's office will
   provide an update when there is a change. Contact his/her office again 2-3 days prior to the
   event (MilAir requests are confirmed during this period and transportation adjustments may
   be required).
A5.3. Transportation. Whether the DV is arriving at the airport or base operations, check with
protocol to confirm transportation was arranged with base transportation. If the DV arrives via
MilAir at base operations, either the escort officer or a transportation driver will be responsible
for picking the DV up. In either case, the escort officer will greet the DV upon arrival. If
escorting a general officer, make sure the appropriate star plate is on the car (the star(s) should
point up). If alone in the car, before driving, remove the plate. Replace it before the DV gets in
the vehicle.
A5.4. Lodging Check-In. Before departing for the airport or base operations, pre-register the
DV at the lodging office, pick up the room key, locate the room, and inspect it. During the
inspection, ensure the following items/actions are accounted for/executed.
   A5.4.1. DV's key opens the door
A.5.4.2. Room is clean and furniture is in good repair
   A5.4.3. Fresh linen is on the bed
   A5.4.4. Toilet paper is available/toilet flushes properly
   A5.4.5. Plenty of towels and washcloths are clean and available

   A5.4.6. TV, remote control, DVD player and lights are operational
   A5.4.7. Refrigerator is on, works properly, and is stocked sufficiently
   A5.4.8. Check expiration dates on amenity items (candy bars, milk, juices, etc.); remove
   expired items and report or return them to the lodging front desk
   A5.4.9. Ample hangers are in the closet, iron, ironing board, and starch
   A5.4.10. Check alarm clocks to ensure clocks are set to correct time
   A5.4.11. Phone works (unsecured/secure); directions & directory are located near the phone
   A5.4.12. Nothing remains in the room from the previous occupant
   A5.4.13. Room temperature is comfortable
   A5.4.14. Welcome notes or other welcome items are visible and displayed attractively
A5.5. Pick-Up. Stay apprised of the DV's schedule. Be familiar with and utilize the following
two checklists, one for commercial air arrivals/departures and one for MilAir arrivals/departures.
Commercial reservations often change to MilAir arrangements 1-3 days prior to the visit.
A5.6. Commercial Air.
   A5.6.1. Check with protocol to confirm transportation was arranged with base
   transportation. After pre-registering the DV at the lodging office and inspecting quarters,
   drive to the airport and park as conveniently as possible.
   A5.6.2. Enter the airport and reconfirm arrival time of aircraft on visual displays.
   A5.6.3. Locate DV's gate/disembarkation area and wait for him/her there. Upon arrival,
   greet the DV, introduce yourself, and escort the DV to the baggage claim area.
   A5.6.4. Assist the DV them with luggage and put the luggage in the trunk (identify the trunk
   release mechanism in advance).
   A5.6.5. Open the car door for the DV. DVs are normally seated in the right rear seat,
   however, he or she may want to ride in front; be flexible.
   A5.6.6. Drive to DV lodging or wherever the DV needs to go from the airport.
   A5.6.7. If DV lodging is the destination, the vehicle should pull up to the entrance of the
   building where the DV's room is located. Assist the DV with the car door and luggage, and
   show the DV to his or her room. Before departing, discuss any requirements with the DV,
   identify the location of the staff car/keys (if one is available) and agree on the next meeting
   point (if possible). Provide the DV an escort/business card with phone numbers.
   A5.6.8. Some DVs require minimal assistance from escort officers and may dismiss the
   escort officer after the initial greeting. This is appropriate provided the DV knows how to
   contact the escort officer if assistance is needed during the visit.
   A5.6.9. Commercial Departure. Arrange or confirm transportation with protocol again.
   Pick up DV at previously agreed upon time and place. Assist with luggage, transport DV to
   the airport, assist with luggage and escort him or her to the gate. Confirm aircraft departure
   time has not changed.
A5.7. Military Air (MILAIR).
AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013                                                                     121


  A5.7.1. Coordinate with the protocol officer to obtain instructions on requirements and
  reporting location for MILAIR arrivals. After contacting base transportation to confirm
  vehicle support, pre-registering the DV at the lodging office, and inspecting quarters, drive to
  base operations (if necessary). Park in the front parking lot if utilizing a POV and walk
  through the building to the back counter. If in a staff car, pull around onto the flight line and
  park the car in the circular drive directly in front of the building. Note: This is all
  accomplished in coordination with the protocol officer and dependent upon local installation
  procedures.
  A5.7.2. If requested, assist or check with base operations on the following:
     A5.7.2.1. Check to ensure a welcome message is on the appropriate base marquee(s)
     A5.7.2.2. Arrival time of the aircraft (provide the call sign and the DV's name).
     A5.7.2.3. Ask the controllers to identify exactly where the aircraft will park on the flight
     line (confirm visually). Transient alert crew will set up equipment near the intended
     aircraft parking spot.
  A5.7.3. If a local DV is also assigned to greet the incoming DV, locate the individual, carry
  out introductions and brief him or her as necessary. If the local DV's rank is below the
  incoming DV's, then the local DV should also salute the aircraft. The local DV should stand
  to the escort officer‘s right on the flight line. He or she should lead "present arms" and
  "order arms" for both, unless this individual is a civilian. In this case, only the military escort
  officer will salute.
  A5.7.4. As the aircraft lands, the escort officer positions him or herself on the center edge of
  the painted red carpet. Although a guideline, the escort officer should ensure he or she stays
  out of the way of danger.
  A5.7.5. As the aircraft comes to a stop, military should salute; once the engines are off,
  move toward the aircraft door.
  A5.7.6. The transportation driver should pull staff car up to the aircraft. If the escort officer
  is driving, pull the car close to the aircraft while the local DV greets and leave it running
  while assisting with luggage. If both the greeter and the driver, the escort officer will have to
  be flexible. (Hint: Position the car close to the yellow line, leave it running as the aircraft
  taxis toward its parking spot, jump out of the vehicle, and quickly take position to salute and
  greet.)
  A5.7.7. Greet the DV, accomplish introductions and assist with all bags.
  A5.7.8. Open the car door for the DV, ensure bags are in the trunk.
  A5.7.9. Salute the car as it drives away (if a transportation driver is present or the DV
  chooses to drive the staff car); or, get in the car and drive the DV to the DV
  quarters/destination.
  A5.7.10. If DV lodging is the destination, pull the staff car up to the entrance of the building
  where the DV's room is located. Assist the DV with the car door and luggage, and show the
  DV to his or her room. Before departing, discuss any requirements with the DV and agree on
  the next meeting point (if possible). Provide the DV an escort/business card with phone
  numbers. If the staff car does not remain at the DVQ for the DV's use, return the vehicle to
 122                                                     AFPAM34-1202 10 JANUARY 2013


   transportation. If the car stays with the DV (usually the case), leave the car and arrange
   personal transportation.
   A5.7.11. Some DVs require minimal assistance from escort officers and may dismiss the
   escort officer after the initial greeting. This is appropriate provided the DV knows how to
   contact the escort officer if assistance is needed during the visit.
   A5.7.12. MILAIR Departure. Call base operations in advance to confirm departure time or
   to inform them (and the aircrew) that the DV desires to depart earlier or later. Pick up the
   DV at agreed upon time and location and transport to base operations or meet him/her at base
   operations. The aircrew should be ready to receive. Assist with bags and salute the aircraft
   as soon as it begins to move out (if military), and then move back toward base operations.
   Remain at base operations until the aircraft takes off.
A5.8. Reminders.
   A5.8.1. In the days prior to the DV's arrival, protocol will obtain updates on the DV's travel
   plans. Stay in contact with the protocol project officer to avoid miss any changes.
   A5.8.2. Uniform for escort duty is Service Dress unless instructed otherwise.
   A5.8.3. Be able to properly pronounce the DV's name and obtain a biography in order to
   become familiar with the DV's background and appearance (for recognition purposes at the
   airport).
   A5.8.4. Use common sense and remain flexible.
   A5.8.5. Consider uniform condition and personal appearance
   A5.8.6. Study directions to and from the airport prior to the DV's arrival and dry run the
   route if necessary.
   A5.8.7. Keep a list of relevant POC telephone numbers (i.e. transportation, protocol, and
   lodging) available at all times; protocol will provide this list.
   A5.8.8. Have a copy and be familiar with the itinerary of the event the DV is attending.
   A5.8.9. If questions or concerns arise, contact protocol. If asked a question to which the
   answer is unknown, do not make any assumptions, contact protocol for guidance.
   A5.8.10. Arrive at base operations or the airport at least 30 minutes prior to scheduled
   arrival time.
   A5.8.11. Be prepared for inclement weather (umbrella).
   A5.8.12. Be familiar with the events the DV is attending (i.e., if attending a conference,
   obtain a copy of the conference itinerary and briefing agenda from the project officer).
   A5.8.13. Know locations of restrooms, telephones, etc.
   A5.8.14. Know dress requirements for every event (for the DV and the spouse).
   A5.8.15. Carry a notepad.

Figure A5.1. Quick Reference Escort Checklist
      1. Escorts are notified by unit executive officer of escort duty.

      2. Contact protocol and obtain information pertinent to the DV visit.

      3. Call the DV‘s office to speak with the DV‘s secretary, exec and/or aide; provide
         contact numbers and inquire about the DV‘s itinerary.

      4. Monitor the DV‘s arrival time-it usually changes! Do this through protocol instead of
         calling the DV‘s office too frequently. If contacted by the DV‘s office with an update,
         back-brief protocol. It may affect a local DV greeter's schedule.

      5. Once arrival/departure times, lodging, and transportation are confirmed, mentally
         walk through the plan to ensure every detail is covered.

      6. Pre-register the DV at the DV quarters before his/her arrival. Pick up the key, locate
         the room and inspect it if it is ready.

      7. Arrive at the designated arrival point (base ops/airport) at least 30 minutes ahead of
         time. If there are any changes, communicate them to the local DV greeter so he/she
         does not waste time by arriving too early or late.

      8. Double check that transportation is available with the correct rank displayed (if
         appropriate). Brief the local DV greeter upon arrival and get into position soon after
         the ten mile out call-do not forget earplugs!

      9. Greet the DV upon arrival, collect any bags, and transport the DV to the appropriate
         destination.

      10. Agree on departure plans with the DV, as well as any other important issues, before
          departing. Ensure the DV has all necessary contact info in case needed.

      11. See the DV off-assist with any extras and everything required. Call protocol for
          assistance.
