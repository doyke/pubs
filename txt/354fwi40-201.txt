1. General. This instruction serves as the comprehensive, written radiation program for EAFB.
It encompasses radioactive material (RAM), and machines or devices that produce ionizing,
radio frequency, microwave or laser radiation. It is intended to safeguard the health of military
and civilian employees, while permitting maximum benefits from the use of radiation emitters.
     1.1. There are two types of radiation that can pose an occupational hazard.
        1.1.1. Ionizing radiation is radiation with enough energy to change the electron structure
        of human cells. The health effects of ionizing radiation include increased risk of cancer
        and birth defects.
        1.1.2. Nonionizing radiation does not contain enough energy to change the electron
        structure of human cells. The health effects of nonionizing radiation include deep tissue
        heating and cataracts (Radio Frequency Radiation), and eye/skin damage (laser
        radiation).
     1.2. All exposures to ionizing radiation shall be as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA)
     with existing technology, costs, and operations requirements. Since Radio Frequency
     Radiation and lasers are not linked to increased cancer risk, ALARA does not apply to
     nonionizing radiation emitters.

       dosimetry program and report exposures to each individual. Agencies operating under a
       radioactive material permit must maintain their 1499 listings for at least three years. All
       others must maintain the listings until they receive a current AF form 1527-1, Annual
       Report of Individual Occupation Exposure to Ionizing Radiation.
3. USAF Radioactive Material Permits (RAMP). The USAF Radioisotope Committee
(USAF RIC), holds a single broad-scope Nuclear Regulatory Committee (NRC) license. The
USAF RIC is the sole authority within the AF to approve and control use, possession, receipt,
transfer, and disposal of all radioactive material for which the NRC has jurisdiction. No
radioactive material can be procured or accepted without a USAF RIC permit, except as
provided for in AFI 40-201.
   3.1. Obtaining USAF RAMP. Follow the procedures outlined in AFI 40-201. The permit
   holder is responsible for submitting renewal applications far enough in advance of the old
   permit’s expiration date to ensure continued compliance.
   3.2. Control Procedures. Using organizations must fully comply with specific requirements
   contained in the USAF RAMP. The base RSO and permit RSO conducts periodic surveys to
   ensure compliance. Swipe/leak tests are performed by the permit holder as specified in the
   permit and then submitted to the permit RSO. The permit RSO will assign a unique tracking
   number, perform initial readings, and ship the samples to the laboratory for confirmation.
   The permit RSO will review and sign laboratory reports, file a copy in the permit binder and
   distribute a copy to the permittee.
   3.3. Documentation.       The using organization maintains all original documentation
   concerning the RAMP. The Permit RSO maintains a duplicate copy. Permit termination
   does not relieve the user of documentation requirements for at least three years following the
   termination of the permit.
4. Radioactive Waste Disposal Procedures: Specific procedures and requirements for
radioactive waste disposal are found in AFI 40-201. Coordinate ALL disposal actions through
the base RSO.
5. Ionizing Radiation Exposure Control and Monitoring:
   5.1. Occupational exposure limits for radiation workers are in 10 CFR 20 Subpart C,
   including those for pregnant workers. A pregnant worker’s unborn child must not receive an
   accumulated dose greater than 0.5 rem. Dose limits for members of the general public are in
   10 CFR 20, Subpart D.
 8                                                             354FWI40-201 7 MARCH 2012


     5.2. Monitoring ionizing radiation exposures:
        5.2.1. BE issues thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) to personnel who are likely to
        receive an accumulated ionizing radiation dose exceeding 10 percent of the exposure
        guidelines set in 10 CFR 20. BE monitors personnel doses as specified by AFI 48-125.
        5.2.2. Units are responsible for funding/obtaining dosimetry devices other than TLDs.
        5.2.3. Personnel must never tamper with their TLD. Should a TLD be accidentally
        damaged or exposed, return it to BE immediately. Personnel must explain the nature of
        the incident to assist in evaluating the actual dosage received, if any.
        5.2.4. Personnel wear their TLD only while performing radiation duties and store it with
        the control TLD. They never wear the TLD when receiving dental or medical diagnostic
        examinations.
     5.3. TLD Medical Monitoring Requirements. Each individual either newly assigned to
     radiation duties or arriving at EAFB for assignment to radiation duties reports to BE,
     building 3349, before starting those duties. At BE they receive a radiation safety briefing
     and instructions on the proper use and wear of TLDs. Females are informed of radiation
     hazards to a developing fetus as well as procedures to follow if they suspect they are
     pregnant.
6. Procedures for Radioactive Materials.
     6.1. Storage. All markings on an isotope in storage must be in such a position that no
     radiological hazards exist to personnel reading them.
     6.2. Receipt. The 354 LRS or 168 LRS will normally be the first organization to receive
     radioactive material, but all organizations are responsible for ensuring package receipt
     complies with the following requirements.
        6.2.1. Call the base RSO immediately (377-6687 or x1500 after duty hours) upon
        receiving any radioactive material labeled with a Department of Transportation (DOT)
        Standard Form (SF) 414 indicating a RAD I, RAD II, or RAD III radiation label (49 CFR
        172.403). The base RSO will arrange a receipt survey for the package, if necessary
        and/or update the radioactive material inventory. If any shipment appears damaged, has
