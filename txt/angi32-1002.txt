This instruction expands on the guidance provided by the 32 series of Air Force publications that
concern the Air National Guard (ANG). This instruction provides guidance for implementation
of operational and procedural policy guidance to implement execution of installation and facility
programs of Air National Guard Installations and Mission Support (NGB/A7) under the authority
of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 32-10112, Installation Geospatial Information and Services. This
instruction and referenced documents provide guidance on procedures and relationships between
ANG Staff Augmentation Teams and assigned Affiliate units consisting of the 4FPSB, 4FPAW
and 4FPAN Unit Type Codes (UTCs). Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been updated to reflect changes to include adding three Affiliate Units to the
Procedures and changing three units from Flights to Squadrons to line up with the missions.
1. PURPOSE.
   1.1. This instruction outlines procedures for Unit enhancement, training and implementation
   of Affiliated Units with Staff Augmentation Teams (S-Teams).
2. GENERAL.
2                                                          ANGI32-1002 18 SEPTEMBER 2012


    2.1. This instruction recognizes that the demand for theater engineering assets is high and
    capitalizes on the opportunity for S-Team and Affiliate Units to train together and be a viable
    resource to the ANG and the Air Force. By establishing informal relationships at home
    stations and in training environments, team integrity will be enhanced when deployed
    together in theater. The S-Team units and Affiliate Units will work together to foster a spirit
    of cooperation and collaboration to enhance training and increase capabilities. Affiliate
    Units are still under ADCON and OPCON of their various states, but will train to the same
    Air Force Instruction 10-210 standards as S-Teams, since they may be mobilized and
    deployed in support of S-Team missions. This relationship is strictly informal during non
    mobilization periods but highly encouraged since they will be mobilized into a single unit.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES.
    3.1. S-Team units will primarily:
       3.1.1. Initiate contact with Affiliate Units as assigned by this instruction.
       3.1.2. Conduct quarterly conference calls with Affiliate Units to discuss topics of interest
       and coordination. Ideally, these will be in the months of March, June, September and
       December.
       3.1.3. Maintain an ongoing annual deployment list and incorporate Affiliate Units into
       various training opportunities with the S-Team. Affiliate Unit members are strongly
       encouraged to volunteer for any of the deployments. Commanders will discuss and
       finalize team composition to ensure training and mission requirements are met. The S-
       Team full-time staff will be the focal point for all deployment matters.
       3.1.4. Be the primary Point of Contact for interface with Combatant Commanders.
       3.1.5. Maintain a Team Site within the ANG Enterprise Share Point environment with
       the following minimum information: mission brief, unit organization chart, annual
       deployment list, training plan, recruiting brochure, resume book, and calendar showing
       the unit’s drill schedule.
    3.2. Affiliate Units will:
       3.2.1. Participate in quarterly conference calls initiated by the S-Team.
       3.2.2. Respond to requests for deployment augmentation and participate to the greatest
       extent possible.
       3.2.3. Maintain a sub-site on the parent S-Team’s Team Site with the following
       information: unit organization chart, resume book, contact information, and annual drill
       schedule.
       3.2.4. Responsible for ensuring their personnel comply with AFI 10-210 training
       requirements for 4FPS6 teams.
    3.3. NGB/A7X will:
       3.3.1. Determine which S-Team and Affiliate Units will be mobilized in support of
       mission tasking in a Partial Mobilization status.
       3.3.2. Support S-Teams and Affiliate Units training and collaboration to foster unit
       cohesiveness and capabilities.

5. TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT.
    5.1. S-Team and Affiliate Units are required to meet the training requirements of AFI 10-
    210 for Prime BEEF and the AFI 10-210 S-Team Supplement with the exception of the
    Contingency Construction listed on the Home Station Training (HST) for Prime BEEF.
    5.2. While the majority of S-team training will be done at home station, it is recommended
    that S-Teams participate in a combined training twice per year with the affiliate units. Joint
    training among S-Teams is highly encouraged to enhance the ability to learn from each other
    and share the experiences of other teams for enhanced mission capability. Additionally,
    consolidated training provides a unique venue for headquarters and invited agencies to
    provide guidance and information to all S-Teams.
    5.3. S-Teams typically have higher than average requirements for mandays associated with
    training. For planning purposes it is recommended that each S-team submit a budget to
    NGB/A7X in June each year for additional days and dollars required to support training of
    the S-Teams and Affiliate Units.
    5.4. S-Team and Affiliate Units shall acquire and sustain equipment requirements with the
    UTC 4F9S6 equipment packages.
6. MOBILIZATION.
    6.1. Mobilizations of S-Teams will be done through the NGB/A7X. Primary S-Team and
    Affiliate Units will be notified separately by NGB/A7X through normal channels.
    NGB/A7X (FAM) will monitor and track mobilization packages through NGB/A3XW –
    Mobilization Cell to coordinate with AF.
7. RECOMMENDATIONS.
    7.1. S-Teams and the Affiliate Units will make required logistical and programmatic
    implementations to integrate together.
    7.2. Affiliate Units should take required actions to become familiarized with the related S-
    Teams corresponding MAJCOM’s mission.
    7.3. S-Team personnel should consider obtaining training that will enhance their
    contingency engineering, bare base operations, and project management skills. NGB/A7X
    can assist with avenues to achieve this type of training including Silver Flag participation,
    Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) courses, or other formal courses.

Terms
Staff Augmentation Teams (S-Teams)—Units that provide specialized engineering and fire
protection management personnel to augment Combatant Command (COCOM), Major
Command (MAJCOM), Numbered Air Force (NAF), and combined/joint headquarters staffs.
These teams are trained, equipped, and staffed to ensure the capability to mobilize and deploy
worldwide in support of theater contingency operations and homeland defense which includes
natural disaster or weapons of mass destruction. They provide specialized engineering,
command and control, resource management, fire protection and environmental capabilities.
There are currently five (5) S-Team units within the ANG. The Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC) also has S-Team units, but there are no active duty UTCs.
Affiliate Units—These are predominately former Prime Beef units, located across the country,
who are no longer authorized a full Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (Prime BEEF)
beddown UTC. These units have been restructured into smaller UTCs (to include 4FPSB,
4FPAW and 4FPAN) and typically have a Base Operating Support mission for their base.
Affiliate Units have skill sets which compliment an S-Team mission capability.
