3WGI47-101 23 JULY 2009                                                                          3


   7.2. Family Members of Active Duty Military. Authorized family members of active
   duty personnel, not enrolled in TDP are eligible for routine care on a standby basis. Standby
   care is defined as care provided to patients physically present in the dental clinic waiting
   room for an appointment to become available on that day. The patient checks in at the dental
   reception desk and waits for a dental appointment to become available, which may result
   from a broken appointment, a no-show patient, or when access becomes available to a
   provider that may not have been previously available on the schedule. The squadron
   commander may authorize care for the following duty day for an eligible patient waiting for
   an appointment, if it seems reasonable to anticipate there is unused treatment time available
   the next duty day that may not be filled by the usual means (dental sick call, exam, inter-
   dental clinic referrals, and so forth). The type and quantity of care afforded family members
   of active duty military personnel is based on the capabilities of the dental staff and the
   workload presented by active duty personnel. The Dental Squadron Commander determines
   the amount and type of treatment available. Additional information may be obtained by
   telephoning the Dental Clinic at extension DSN 312-907-580-5020, Monday through Friday,
   0730-1630.
   7.3. Retired Personnel and Their Family Members. The type and quantity of care
   afforded retirees and their family members, on a standby basis, are based on the capabilities
   of the dental staff and the workload presented by active duty personnel. Additional
   information may be obtained by telephoning the Dental Clinic (Monday through Friday,
   0730-1630).
   7.4. Special/Resident Treatment Opportunities. The dental clinic may periodically solicit
   patients not enrolled in the TDP to support resident training requirements or to maintain staff
   competency in specific areas of dentistry. Not all patients receiving treatment will receive
   comprehensive treatment of all indicated dental conditions. Patients selected for treatment
   under these circumstances may be required to sign a consent form citing the potential
   limitations in their scope of treatment. Under such circumstances, dental clinic staff will
   fully inform patients regarding the limitations of the scope of treatment prior to receiving the
   patient’s consent.
8. Treatment of Minors. A parent or legal guardian must be present in the dental clinic
whenever children under 18 years of age are receiving dental treatment. EXCEPTION: A
parent or legal guardian can sign an optional “Parental Authorization for Dental Care” form for
children 13-17 years of age, after examination and discussion of the proposed treatment plan
with the examining dentist. This will allow the child to receive routine, non-surgical care on a
one-time basis without the presence of an adult. Family members who are unruly, or
uncooperative, may be asked to seek civilian care at the sponsor’s expense.
9. Broken Appointments and Cancellations:
   9.1. An appointment is considered broken if the patient does not appear at the appointed
   time. Unit commanders will be notified, by letter, when active duty personnel fail to keep
   appointments. A cancellation is defined as notification to break a scheduled appointment
   more than 24 hours in advance of the appointment time.
   9.2. If patients need to reschedule a dental appointment, it must be done at least one duty day
   prior to the scheduled appointment. If the appointment is not kept, or the call is received the
   same day as the appointment, it will be considered a broken appointment. When a patient in
4                                                                   3WGI47-101 23 JULY 2009


    Dental Class 3 attempts to cancel an appointment, Squadron Commanders, First Sergeants, or
    supervisors will be contacted to approve rescheduling of the patient’s appointment.
    9.3. Broken and canceled appointments may be rescheduled through the dental reception
    section at the Dental Clinic, or by telephone at DSN 312-907-580-5020.
10. Air Force Dental Readiness Assurance Program (AFDRAP):
    10.1. The Dental Squadron AFDRAP monitor will coordinate with the unit health care
    monitors to schedule/reschedule personnel requiring a dental examination appointment.
    10.2. The Dental Squadron AFDRAP monitor will notify the unit commanders through their
    respective health monitors, of those personnel who fail to meet their scheduled AFDRAP
    appointment.
11. Preventive Dentistry Program. The preventive dentistry program provides education
services and treatment to help prevent oral disease and injury. It consists of three phases:
    11.1. Clinical Phase. This phase includes examinations, preventive treatments and
    counseling, athletic mouth guards, and restorative treatments.
    11.2. Community Health Phase. This phase deals with health education and public
    programs for the community serviced by the Dental Squadron. It includes use of the media,
    group presentations, school programs, and monitoring fluoride levels.
       11.2.1. Active promotion of National Children’s Dental Health Month may include oral
       health displays, oral health posters, oral health literature handouts, base newspaper
       articles, and group lectures coordinated with respective school principals.
    11.3. Family Members Children’s Phase. The children’s phase will include coordination
    with the Family Advocacy Officer in cases of suspected maltreatment, as outlined in Dental
    Instruction 44-3, Identification and Reporting of Family Maltreatment.
12. TDP:
    12.1. Direct care for services covered by TDP is not authorized at military dental facilities
    for family members enrolled in the program. Services not covered by TDP are authorized to
    manage the immediate condition and stabilize the patient. The patient is then referred to their
    civilian dentist.
    12.2. TDP enrollment should be done online at www.ucci.com. Click on TRICARE Dental
    Program. Questions can also be directed to their toll free number, 1-800-866-8499 or by
