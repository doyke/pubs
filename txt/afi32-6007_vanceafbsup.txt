                                          Chapter 2

                   PHASE I: PLANNING/CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT

2.1. Project Identification - Key Components. The agencies required in establishment of
project documents include, but are not limited to, Civil Engineering (Housing, Fire, and
Environmental), Security Forces, Judge Advocate, Contracting and Public Affairs.
   2.1.1. Housing Requirements and Market Analysis (HRMA). AF/A7CH conducts and
   manages the HRMA process.         HRMAs determine installation(s) accompanied and
   unaccompanied housing requirements. HRMAs are conducted periodically to identify
   housing requirements by grade and number of bedrooms for 5 years in the future, and are
   reviewed and approved by the Commander, MAJCOM and AF/A7C. Installations and
   MAJCOMs must obtain AF/A7C approval for deviations from an approved HRMA.
   2.1.2. Housing Community Profile (HCP). AF/A7CH conducts and manages the HCP
   process. The HCP documents the condition of FH, identifies construction requirements to
   bring FH and communities up to Air Force standards and analyzes data to determine the
   economical method of investment for the improvement or replacement determination. The
   HCP represents the minimum military housing construction requirements and is the basis for
   privatization project development decisions. An HCP update is not completed for
   installations where FH is fully privatized. HCP updates that are in progress at the time
   privatization project development is initiated are completed through Commander approval of
   the 50 percent submittal of the HCP update.
   2.1.3. Family Housing Master Plan (FHMP). AF/A7CH executes and manages the Air
   Force FHMP which articulates the Air Force housing investment strategy and identifies
   privatization candidates, anticipated scored costs, scopes and years of execution. The FHMP
   incorporates information from the HRMA and the HCP to estimate the required scoring cost
   for HP. It is used by the Air Force to prepare the Program Objective Memoranda (POM) and
   Budget Estimate Submission (BES). FHMPs are reviewed and approved by the installation,
   MAJCOM, AF/A7C, CSAF and Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF). Installations and
   MAJCOMs must obtain AF/A7C approval for deviations from an approved FHMP.
   2.1.4. Project Programming. IAW AFI 32-6002, HP projects are programmed using a
   completed Defense Department (DD) Form 1391, FY___ Military Construction Project
   Data. The purpose of DD Form 1391 is to obtain authorization for the project and funding
   appropriations for scored costs, if any, associated with an MHPI project. DD Form 1391
   identifies the project end-state, scope (number of units resulting from demolition, renovation
   and construction) and the estimated scored cost documented in the FHMP for a particular
   installation. It also includes the scope of traditional Military Construction (MILCON)
   projects that could be accomplished with the available funding when a privatization initiative
   proves infeasible. DD Forms 1391 are reviewed and approved by the installation, the
   MAJCOM and AF/A7C, Programs Division (AF/A7CP). Installations submit DD Forms
   1391 for HP, through the MAJCOM to AF/A7CP as part of the same budget cycle as other
   FH DD Forms 1391. Each installation that plans to be part of a grouped project must submit
   an independent DD Form 1391 reflecting the scope of work planned for their installation.

   2.1.5. Privatized Housing at Joint Bases. Project management and oversight for PH shall
   remain with the Service that executed the privatization project. Oversight functions such as
   Referral/Relocation and furnishing support transfers to the Supporting (Lead) Base.
      2.1.5.1. Management of the ground lease and responsibility for providing municipal
      services for privatized housing (e.g., utilities, refuse removal, fire, and police) shall
      transfer to the supporting Service or as established in a MOA.
      2.1.5.2. The amounts that the PO must reimburse the supporting Service for municipal
      services shall be calculated using the methodology employed by the Service that entered
      into the privatization project.
   2.1.6. Concept Plan Brief. AFCEE will present the Concept Plan Brief, which includes the
   HP project scope, authorities, financials and milestones, to AF/A7C and SAF/IEI prior to
   requesting formal ESG approval. AF/A7CH will then brief the Office of the Under Secretary
   of Defense, Office of Facilities, Energy and Privatization (OUSD (FE&P)) for concept
   approval.
2.2. Project Definition - Key Components.
   2.2.1. Preliminary Planning (Concept) Pro Forma. AF/A7CH determines the feasibility of
   the project by executing a preliminary planning pro forma which serves as the preliminary
   Government cost estimate for scored costs, Government direct loan or Government equity
   investment as well as project unit requirement. The pro forma calculates the projects scored
   costs using risk, recovery and inflation rates established by OMB.
   2.2.2. Execution (Concept) Pro Forma. Once the project feasibility is established by
   AF/A7CH, AFCEE will develop an execution pro forma based on planning pro forma
   guidelines for concept development. The execution pro forma will be used as the basis for
   ESG project concept approval and establishes the amount and terms of Government direct
   loan or Government equity investment. The execution pro forma is coordinated through
   A7CH and SAF/FMCE. Pro forma data is considered source-selection sensitive and must be
   annotated “For Official Use Only,” and may not be released outside Government channels.
   2.2.3. Economic Analysis (EA). The EA calculates life-cycle costs of available alternatives
   to revitalize housing (i.e., status quo, privatization and identical MILCON). See AFI 65-501,
   Economic Analysis, and applicable SAF/FM guidance. The EA report will be prepared by
   the PRESS or RESS contractor, certified by AFCEE and coordinated through AF/A7CH and
   SAF/FMC.
   2.2.4. Credit Scoring Report. The preliminary Credit Scoring Report is prepared with data
   from the concept pro forma and provides insight into the impact of budget scoring when
   offering federal credit for HP. This report will be prepared using the latest version of the
   OMB Credit Subsidy Calculator.
      2.2.4.1. The preliminary report provides an executive level summary of the project and
      provides insight into the level of Government participation and the calculation of budget
      scoring when offering federal credit for HP. The report will be used by AFCEE,
      AF/A7C, SAF/FMCE, the ESG and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). The
      Government estimated scored costs may not be publicly disclosed, unless approved by
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                          25


     the ESG. See the SAF/FM Web site at A3.2 for the most current guidance and template
     for this report.
     2.2.4.2. Final scoring reports are submitted to AF/A7C, SAF/FMB and SAF/FMC no
     later than 10 work days after completion of negotiations and closing of an HP transaction.
     Final scored cost must match the OMB-approved scored cost and subsidies, unless OMB
     approved a change to the scored cost and subsidies.
  2.2.5. Environmental Compliance. Air Force regulations require the execution of an
  Environmental Baseline Survey (EBS) and the Environmental Impact Analysis Process
  (EIAP) for the proposed leased premises during the privatization process.
     2.2.5.1. Environmental Baseline Survey (EBS). During the early stages in the
     privatization process, the environmental condition of the property must be determined.
     This is a Real Property action required by AFI 32-7066, Environmental Baseline Surveys
     in Real Estate Transactions. The EBS process should gather as much environmental and
     historical/cultural information from the base as possible for the proposed leased premises.
     This can include specific site data such as past hazardous waste storage areas, Installation
     Restoration Program documents and historical/cultural information and natural resources
     information. This data will be used this data (along with other factors) to determine the
     viability of land for use in an HP project from an environmental standpoint. The purpose
     is to determine the environmental condition at the property, potential environmental
     liabilities and issues that would make the privatization project unfeasible; therefore, the
     EBS should be started early in the HP process. If the EBS designates the land in the
     project to be either category five (known contamination with removal or remedial action,
     or both, underway, but all required remedial actions have not been taken) or six (known
     contamination where required response action have not been initiated), the land may not
     be conveyed. If the land is designated category seven (area is unevaluated or requires
     additional evaluation), use of that land for PH is not authorized until the category is
     upgraded.
     2.2.5.2. The EIAP is the Air Force process for compliance with National Environmental
     Policy Act (NEPA) and Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations. 32 CFR
     989, Environmental Impact Analysis Process, contains more specific direction on
     implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA, and information for the public and
     other Governmental bodies regarding how NEPA regulations are implemented. The
     purpose of EIAP is to provide agency decision makers information to make
     environmentally informed decisions. EIAP must start early in the privatization concept
     development process. Advance planning is critical to the successful completion of an
     EIAP action. Delayed planning often causes delays in the EIAP schedule and
     privatization implementation.
     2.2.5.3. Where the HP action involves facilities listed on or eligible for the National
     Register of Historic Places, compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA and 36 CFR 800,
     Protection of Historic Properties, is mandatory prior to completion of the EIAP and
     contract award. Refer to AFI 32-7065 for details. It is important that the installation
     work closely with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and potential offerors on
     drafting language for any agreement concluding Section 106 compliance, which will be
     executed and included in the transaction legal documents.
 26                                            AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


          2.2.5.3.1. Formal agreements made under NHPA typically require the PO to operate
          and maintain designated historic facilities in a manner meeting federal preservation
          standards, and maintain coordination with the installation Cultural Resources
          manager. When land upon which the PO operates remains AF property, the land
          remains subject to provisions of NHPA Section 110, the Archaeological Resources
          Protection Act and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and
          the AF retains responsibility for compliance with such authorities.
   2.2.6. Utilities Services Considerations. The Government may not provide utility service to
   every MHPI project; however, provision of utility service is a key component of the project
   costs and must be explored by the project team early in the solicitation process. If the plan
   for the PO to provide utility service to tenants is a cause for concern to the local utility or
   state regulatory utility commission, and there is reason to believe there might be utility
   regulatory or utility contract problems encountered in the HP process, the MAJCOM should
   consult with the AFCESA/CEN at least 6 months prior to solicitation. See paragraph 3.6,
   Utilities Services, for more information.
2.3. Project Feasibility Determination.
   2.3.1. Prior to CSAF approval to begin MHPI project development, a series of project
   criteria are verified to determine if proposed installation housing is a valid privatization
   candidate. When an installation is not a valid privatization candidate, it may be analyzed in
   combination with one or more other installations, also known as a grouping, to determine if
   this results in a viable project. The requirements stem from both statutory, OMB and OSD
   guidance and a project must meet or exceed all of the requirements before approval is
   granted. Criteria are checked again at OSD concept and award approvals.
   2.3.2. Criteria.
       2.3.2.1. Life-cycle cost of an HP project must be equal to or less than the traditional
       MILCON approach. See current SAF/FM policy for life cycle costing for an HP project
       at Web site referenced in Attachment 5.
       2.3.2.2. According to OMB guidelines, Governmental financial participation in a HP
       project with a direct loan or loan guarantee may not exceed 80 percent of the total value
       of the project and private sources must provide at least 20 percent of all resources in the
       project. This is known as the “participation test.” IAW 10 U.S.C. §2875, Investments,
       for a HP project with equity investment, the cash amount of the government investment
       may not exceed 33-1/3 percent of the capital cost of the project. If the government
       conveys land or facilities to the project owner in an equity investment transaction, the
       total value of the Government’s investment (cash, land and facilities) may not exceed 45
       percent of the capital cost of the project. The participation amount includes the value of
       housing conveyed and the scoring required to support the project.
       2.3.2.3. According to OSD policy, the leverage calculation (equivalent MILCON
       development cost of a project divided by the amount of scored dollars required for the
       project) should be equal to or greater than 3:1. However, the Air Force and OSD may
       consider candidate projects with a leverage ratio less than 3:1 on a case-by-case basis.
2.4. Transaction Structuring.
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                            27


   2.4.1. Non-Federal Acquisition Regulations (Non-FAR) Transaction. The Air Force
   executes the HP Program through non-FAR acquisitions. The real estate transaction utilizes
   fair, timely and cost-effective procedures of real estate development, real estate finance and
   real estate management for solicitation, evaluation and selection of a Highest-Ranked Offeror
   (HRO) proposal most advantageous to the Government.
   2.4.2. Long-term Lease. To the extent practicable, use long-term ground leases and avoid
   conveyance of land underlying existing housing or other Government land for privatization
   projects. However, if land is conveyed, transfers of land from federal ownership will require
   additional environmental and cultural resources compliance actions; see 32 CFR 989, AFI
   32-7066 and AFI 32-7065 for details. Finances, current and future land use and school
   impact aid issues must be fully justified in the Concept Plan Brief.
       2.4.2.1. Low-level Impact Aid is paid for children living on private property, whose
       parents are on active duty and serves to compensate the local area for the loss of local
       sales tax revenue due to the parents purchasing items tax-free on base.
       2.4.2.2. High-level Impact Aid is paid for children who live on federal property to
       reimburse the school district for the revenue they otherwise would have received from
       property tax. The amount paid by the Federal Government is inversely proportional to
       the wealth of the school district. The district must cover the remainder of the education
       costs, which is paid primarily from sales and property taxes.
       2.4.2.3. Many states have the right to claim high Impact Aid for students who reside on
       federally leased land as well as the ability to tax the real property improvements to the
       property that now belong to the PO. Local school districts may also receive Federal
       Impact Aid from the Department of Education and/or the DoD for children of active duty
       military and civilians who work on military installations. When Government housing is
       privatized, Impact Aid may be affected depending on whether the land is leased or
       conveyed.
       2.4.2.4. The Department of Education has the responsibility to determine each district
       Impact Aid benefits based on the inputs of the school district and verification from the
       installation and PO.
   2.4.3. Legal Jurisdiction of Federal Property. Legal jurisdiction of federal property can be
   exclusive, proprietary, or concurrent as defined by AFH 32-9007, Managing Air Force Real
   Property. Installations may have different jurisdictions on different real estate parcels.
   Jurisdictional status is subject to change at the discretion of the federal and state
   Governments. Jurisdiction is not changed by leasing property but may change when
   conveying property.
2.5. Development Site Visits. Installations and MAJCOMs work with AFCEE to coordinate
and schedule site visits to meet project milestones. Installations and MAJCOMs maximize PDT
participation during AFCEE visits to ensure objectives are achieved and the project meets
installation requirements. The process timeline makes it essential for the Air Force to provide
timely Government-furnished materials and comments on deliverables.
2.6. Program Adjustments: After a DD Form 1391 is provided to Congress for authorization
and appropriation, projects must follow MILCON procedures for scope, cost changes and
approvals, through the Notification of Intent to Solicit and the Notification of Award, provided to
 28                                           AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


SAF/LLP and SAF/FMBL by AF/A7C, and then to Congress. AF/A7C also notifies OUSD
(FE&P). After such notifications, no substantive changes may be made to a project scope or
scoring without approval from AF/A7C and SAF/IEI.
   2.6.1. Scoring or scope changes of 15 percent or less of the dollar amount of the approved
   DD Form 1391 require approval by AF/A7CH. Scoring or scope changes greater than 15
   percent and up to 25 percent require approval by AF/A7C. Scoring or scope changes greater
   greater than 25 percent require approval by SAF/IEI and congressional notification through
   the congressional notifications in paragraph 2.6. AFCEE submits requests for scoring or
   scope changes to AF/A7CH.
   2.6.2. After SAF/IEI, AF/A7C or AFCEE/CL approves program changes (approval authority
   dependent upon scope parameters outlined in delegated authorities or other ESG approved
   program operating guidelines) to an HP project, AFCEE forwards a proposed development
   and solicitation schedule to AF/A7CH and the ESG for approval and inclusion in the FHMP.
   AFCEE monitors compliance with the project schedule and coordinates changes with
   AF/A7CH, the ESG and SAF/IEI.
2.7. Project Cancellation. When an MHPI project is no longer practical for an FHMP-
identified project, AFCEE sends a memorandum to AF/A7C with full justification requesting
cancellation of the project and authority to proceed with the alternative MILCON project
identified in DD Form 1391. The funding of design funds to affect the MILCON project will be
the responsibility of the MAJCOM.
2.8. Program Reporting. In coordination with each MAJCOM, AFCEE provides quarterly
updated milestones to AF/A7C on projects in development. Milestones include EIAP
completion dates (if applicable), projected and actual OSD concept approval dates, congressional
notifications (solicitation, award and funds transfer) and closing dates. Changes to the
milestones must be IAW paragraph 2.6. AF/A7CH coordinates this information with the
appropriate offices and sends it to OUSD (FE&P).
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                             29


                                           Chapter 3

                            PHASE II: PROJECT EXECUTION

3.1. Phase II—Project Acquisition Key Components.
   3.1.1. Request for Proposal (RFP) / Request for Qualifications (RFQ). The RFP or the RFQ
   is the solicitation document AFCEE uses to solicit proposals to privatize military family
   housing. The RFP or RFQ describes to industry the existing conditions, project
   requirements, proposal submittal requirements and evaluation standards. Use of the most
   current version of the generic solicitation document is mandatory. After the project concept
   is approved by SAF/IEI, AF/A7C coordinates with OUSD (FE&P) for approval to release the
   solicitation.
   3.1.2. AFCEE develops the RFP or RFQ in coordination with functionals at all levels. After
   SAF/IEI approves the concept, SAF/IEI (through SAF/LL) and SAF/FMB (through
   SAF/FMBL) notify Congress of the intent to solicit the project IAW 10 U.S.C. §2884,
   Reports.
   3.1.3. If the HP transaction includes conveyance of the land under the housing structures,
   utilities in the housing area may be included in a separate Utilities Privatization (UP)
   solicitation.
   3.1.4. Points of demarcation (POD) for utility systems shall be established, clearly
   delineating where ownership responsibility for utility infrastructure changes from the MHPI
   Project Owner (PO) to either the Base Civil Engineer (BCE) or the UP System Owner (SO).
   PODs shall normally be established in accordance with the J-Section templates in the
   approved UP Generic RFP. PODs shall be established by installations, in coordination with
   their MAJCOMs, AFCEE/HP and AFCESA/CENU.
   3.1.5. To ensure the MHPI project properly reimburses the Air Force for the marginal cost of
   providing utilities to privatized housing, an “MHPI System” will be identified for each utility
   at each base. The MHPI System will consist of all utility infrastructure components that
   solely serve housing, including utility infrastructure owned by the PO. Multi-purpose
   components of the installation utility system that serve housing, but are also used to deliver
   utility services to Air Force facilities located within the housing area, or are also for the
   further delivery of utility services to Air Force facilities located outside of the housing area
   (Multi-Purpose Lines), will not be included in the MHPI System. The MHPI System shall be
   established by installations, in coordination with their MAJCOMs, AFCEE/HP and
   AFCESA/CENU.
   3.1.6. A description of the MHPI System and the approved POD shall be included in MHPI
   project solicitation, as well as a description of the methodology used to determine the utility
   reimbursement rate charged the PO for the commodity plus the O&M, capital repair, and
   improvements for the MHPI System. Solicitations that have been previously issued but for
   which a Highest Ranked Offeror has not been selected shall be amended to incorporate this
   information. The installation or PO (if the installation has privatized the utility) shall retain
   ownership of the MHPI System. The MHPI System, if owned by the installation, may be
   subsequently conveyed to a UP contractor pursuant to the award of a UP project at the
   installation after closing of the MHPI project.
 30                                             AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   3.1.7. Reimbursements by MHPI Project Owners for utility O&M and capital repair and
   improvements shall be computed as follows:
       3.1.7.1. The installation pays 100% of the costs of O&M and capital repair and
       improvements of the Multi-Purpose Lines. However, the MHPI Project Owner shall
       reimburse the Air Force IAW 10 U.S.C. §2872a for the cost of any work undertaken by
       the Air Force on the Multi-Purpose Lines for the sole purpose of accommodating the
       MHPI Project, e.g., relocating a utility main to facilitate the construction of the privately-
       owned housing units.
       3.1.7.2. The MHPI Project shall reimburse the Air Force IAW 10 U.S.C. §2872a for the
       cost of any O&M or capital repair and improvements on the MHPI System that meet the
       “sole benefit test” as defined in AFI 32-1061.
       3.1.7.3. If the HP transaction includes leasing land under the housing structures, utilities
       may be included in a separate UP solicitation.
3.2. Industry Forum. The purpose of the Industry Forum is to communicate the HP project
requirements and receive comments from industry, local Government officials and other
interested parties. The forum is presented to educate the local community, interested private
companies and other functions on the aspects of each MHPI. As a courtesy, SAF/FMBL and
SAF/LLP send an informal notice of the Industry Forum to congressional representatives and
senators from the district and state of project location.
3.3. Offeror Selection. The Acquisition Support Team (AST) consists of representatives from
the installations, MAJCOMs and AFCEE. The Contracting Officer, SAF/GCN-RPO and the
PRESS or RESS contractor advise the AST. The AST evaluates proposals against the RFP or
RFQ factors, conducts comparative analyses and ranks the offerors. The PRESS or RESS
contractor provides advisory and assistance services in support of the Government's efforts to
solicit, evaluate, negotiate and finalize real estate transactions for military housing, but does not
have overall contractual responsibility for finalizing the transactions. Activities of the PRESS or
RESS contractor may include developing solicitation documents, ensuring all submittal
requirements are met; developing real estate appraisals, land leases and conveyance documents;
evaluating proposals, use agreements, management and operations plans, and other financial and
legal instruments; and, facilitating project development activities, such as Site Orientation Visits,
Industry Forums and PDT workshops. The Task Orders issued to the PRESS or RESS
contractors govern their activities.
   3.3.1. The AST recommendation to SAF/IEI and the ESG of the HRO must include all
   financial documents (e.g., pro forma, scoring report) and be coordinated with members of the
   ESG before AFCEE presents the AST selection briefing to SAF/IEI for approval.
   3.3.2. Following SAF/IEI approval of the HRO and coordination with OUSD (FE&P) of the
   source selection, SAF/IEI (through SAF/LL) and SAF/FMB (through SAF/FMBL) notify
   Congress of intent to award IAW 10 U.S.C. §2884, Reports. Following OMB approval of
   the scored cost, OSD(C) also notifies Congress IAW 10 U.S.C. §2883, DoD Housing Funds,
   of the intent to transfer funds to the OSD Family Housing Improvement Fund (FHIF) to
   cover the project scored cost.
3.4. Transaction Closure.
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                             31


   3.4.1. The notifications to award and transfer funds give congressional members the
   opportunity to comment on the proposed award.
   3.4.2. During the notification of intent to award period, negotiations with the HRO
   commence, and may lead to closing the project. Once the congressional notification to award
   period expires, exclusive negotiations with the HRO continue. Tenant lease agreements may
   be signed and public announcements may be made with approval from SAF/IEI.
   3.4.3. Once congressional notification of intent to transfer funds is complete, OSD(C) has
   authority to approve funds transfers to the FHIF.
   3.4.4. The AST shall concur, by majority agreement, on negotiated changes before final
   approval by the selection authority, SAF/IEI.
   3.4.5. Design Process.       At transaction closure a design schedule is established. A
   preliminary design, as agreed to by the AST members, has been accomplished (typically
   35%) at or near HRO selection. Although the majority of design development, due diligence
   and review typically occurs after transaction closing, it is vital to ensure required stakeholder
   input is also captured before the transaction is finalized.
       3.4.5.1. Selected MAJCOM and installation reviewers must understand the project
       requirements, architectural plans, construction specifications, environmental
       requirements and applicable code requirements.
       3.4.5.2. AFCEE/HP must ensure stakeholders are made aware of the design review
       process and deadlines for each level of design.
       3.4.5.3. The MAJCOM GOH coordinator should be involved if GOH is under design
       and/or renovation to ensure all specific Air Force GOH design items and standards are
       included.
3.5. Ancillary Support Facilities.
   3.5.1. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. §2871(1), Definitions, ancillary support facilities, such
   as community centers, swimming pools, tot lots, other recreational facilities, HMO,
   maintenance facilities and other similar facilities may be included in the project if they are
   designed to serve the privatized housing tenants and support FH.
   3.5.2. Ancillary supporting facilities must be sized to support only PH, not other
   populations. Additional capacity, if not used by the tenants of PH, may be used by others, if
   the PO agrees.
   3.5.3. The PO is otherwise prohibited from providing any resale merchandise, services, or
   commercial recreational operations or activities that would be in direct competition with
   Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA)
   unless approved by the appropriate authority and as outlined in project transaction
   documents.
   3.5.4. The project solicitation documents require the PO to compensate AAFES, DeCA or
   the installation Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI) for the undepreciated or
   surcharge investment in any facilities or improvements conveyed with the project where
   these entities have an investment.
 32                                            AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   3.5.5. All future HP projects will include the requirement for a customer service facility
   which allows for the co-location of AF and PO privatization property management (PMO)
   staff, when feasible. At existing privatized housing locations, Installation Commanders and
   POs are encouraged to actively partner and share existing customer service facilities where
   possible, to include joint base locations. At a minimum, at least one person from each staff
   should permanently relocate to the other’s customer service facility to conduct their daily
   activities. All costs associated with relocation, furnishings & communications for the
   Government housing staff will be funded with P-721 Military Family Housing (MFH)
   appropriations.
       3.5.5.1. Co-location solutions will be monitored and included within project reports
       during Annual Site Visits and Compliance Audits conducted by the AFCEE/HP.
       3.5.5.2. The AF HMO shall remain on the main-base area due to tangential management
       of dormitories and other day-to-day interface with base agencies.
       3.5.5.3. All HMO and PMO Staff should be co-located to the maximum extent possible.
       When HMO and PMO offices are co-located in the same facility, they should be situated
       in separate office spaces so as to minimize conflicts over the use and funding of resources
       and to allow for some degree of privacy. However, there should be a common reception
       area to properly greet and direct customers. Conference rooms can be shared. Where
       there is a common receptionist in the Welcome Center, both the HMO and PMO should
       share responsibility and ensure all incoming personnel first receive a briefing by HMO
       regarding housing options, including PH. Property Managers and Capital Asset
       Managers should be located in proximity to each other.
       3.5.5.4. Ground rules need to be established at the local level regarding responsibility for
       use of common equipment/spaces, expenses, alterations, utilities, communication
       requirements, Government telephone lines (Defense Switched Network [DSN]) for the
       PMO.
       3.5.5.5. Joint installation government Web sites shall be monitored by the HMO.
       3.5.5.6. Formal training and partnering sessions shall be conducted regularly between the
       PMO and HMO staff to ensure mutual understanding and open channels of
       communication (i.e., within first 90 days of co-location and every 2 years thereafter for
       the first five years).
       3.5.5.7. Residents should be educated up-front regarding appropriate points-of-contact
       for different issues and the relationships between the various housing management
       parties.
3.6. Utilities Services. The solicitation documents must provide a detailed description of the
utility service to be provided to PH tenants, including maintenance and response times to routine
and emergency service calls. After a project is awarded, costs and usage (estimated or actual) for
the utility allowance are calculated using the process outlined in transaction documents. The
utility owner/provider must comply with applicable provisions of the Clean Water Act and the
Safe Drinking Water Act, including, but not limited to, sampling and employing certified
operators. See paragraph 2.2.6 for more information.
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                          33


  3.6.1. Utility Charges. Utility infrastructure and commodity charges are installation specific.
  The installation provides information (costs and usage) to the PDT to estimate the Utility
  Allowance for electricity and gas or heating oil for each type of house to be privatized and
  for common areas. The offerors use this information to estimate the utility costs in their pro
  forma.
  3.6.2. Utility Reimbursement. Use information on AF Form 3556, Utility Sales Rates
  Computation Worksheet, as the source document to calculate the reimbursable rate. Refer to
  AFI 32-1061 for guidance in calculating rates. Rates are updated IAW project transaction
  documents. The PO reimburses the Government for utility services in two separate charges:
  commodity charge and O&M or capital construction charge.
     3.6.2.1. The first charge is the monthly utility bill, which is based on the sum of cost of
     the basic commodity (average cost of purchased utility service) plus utility distribution
     system line losses.
     3.6.2.2. The second charge, applicable when part of the installation utility distribution
     system is used solely to provide service to the HP project, is a “pay-as-you-go” charge for
     O&M or capital construction required only on that part of the system solely servicing the
     MHPI project. If there are Air Force facilities either within the boundaries, of or further
     serviced through the MHPI project that receive utility service from the MHPI system, that
     particular MHPI project is entirely exempt from O&M and capital charges on utility lines
     leading to the MHPI project.
     3.6.2.3. For utility reimbursement at joint bases, the amount owed shall be based on the
     privatized housing project’s legal documents, accepted pro formas, and the historical
     practice of calculating such costs by the supported Service. Reimbursement calculations
     shall not be based on the methodology of a supporting Service if the calculations conflict
     with the original deal terms, and any payment received shall be credited to the
     appropriation or working capital account from which the cost of furnishing the utilities or
     services concerned was paid. The only exception is when the Services and project
     developer/owner enter into a mutually agreed adjustment that is determined to be in the
     best interest of all parties.
  3.6.3. Fire and Police Reimbursement. When fire protection and security force protection
  and police services is a requirement for PH the Housing Asset Manager will facilitate annual
  updates to fire protection and security forces calculations with Civil Engineer and Security
  Forces Resource Advisors IAW the project transaction documents and annual reimbursement
  guidance. The respective Resource Advisors will receive updates for annual number of
  responses, with supporting call logs, as necessary, which will exclude Privacy Act
  information, from the Fire Department and Security Forces IAW the fire protection and
  security forces reimbursement methodology (Attachments 2/3; Fire/Police Reimbursement
  Methodology and Attachment 4 Fact Sheet-Fire & Police Reimbursement for HP Projects).
  AFCEE/HP will initiate an annual data call to the Housing Asset Manager with applicable
  updates to Personnel and vehicle costs.
     3.6.3.1. The Installation Housing Asset Manager is the liaison for coordinating the fire
     protection and security forces reimbursement annual updates with appropriate installation
     offices; Fire Department and Security Forces and their Resource Advisors, Accounting
     Liaison Office (ALO), Regional DFAS site office, and PO/PMO personnel, with review

      and approval by AFCEE/HP. The Housing AM should ensure a reimbursement process
      is established; billings prepared and costs updated annually IAW transaction documents
      and established reimbursement guidance. Annual updates are accomplished IAW project
      transaction documents and in time to allow PO time for proper budgeting of these
      expenses.
      3.6.3.2. The Housing Asset Manager, as required, will advise AFCEE/HP of disputes or
      other significant issues concerning fire protection and security forces reimbursements.
      3.6.3.3. For fire and police services reimbursement at joint bases, the amount owed shall
      be based on the privatized housing project’s legal documents, accepted pro formas, and
      the historical practice of calculating such costs by the supported Service. Reimbursement
      calculations shall not be based on the methodology of a supporting Service if the
      calculations conflict with the original deal terms, and any payment received shall be
      credited to the appropriation or working capital account from which the cost of furnishing
      the utilities or services concerned was paid. The only exception is when the Services and
      project developer/owner enter into a mutually agreed adjustment that is determined to be
      in the best interest of all parties.
3.7. Appropriated Funds (APF).
   3.7.1. Housing Privatization (HP) (P727) Funds. A subproject of the MFH Operations
   Budget Programs Activity Codes (BPAC) (P727) is the sole source of funds used to develop,
   acquire and execute HP. BPAC P727 provides funding for:
      3.7.1.1. Environmental assessments, baseline surveys or supplemental studies, initial pro
      forma and EA development, historic properties inventory under NHPA Section 106 and
      required property surveys.
      3.7.1.2. Industry forums and solicitations.
      3.7.1.3. AFCEE/HP costs to include all contract costs, temporary duty (TDY), training
      and nonmaterial support costs.
      3.7.1.4. Project oversight (construction      and   day-to-day    operations),    portfolio
      management and PH operations support.
      3.7.1.5. Support consultants and higher headquarters oversight and supervision.
      3.7.1.6. P727 funds may not be used for construction, demolition and service contract
      requirements to support execution of an MHPI.
   3.7.2. Military Family Housing (MFH) Operations (P721) and Maintenance (O&M) (P722)
   Funds. Prior to transaction closure, P721 funds may be used to fund environmental surveys
   and studies. P722 or MFH MILCON funds may be used to perform abatement, remediation
   or other environmental projects in preparation for HP. Other Government-specific functions
   associated with maintaining Housing Management and Operations are funded within the
   MFH O&M appropriation budget process. For installations with pending HP, continue
   funding Housing Management and Operations with MFH P721 funds until transaction
   closure. The installation Housing Asset Manager is responsible for budgeting for and
   executing MFH funds. The Housing Asset Manager will validate P721 costs associated with
   PH. Once project is closed no P-722 funds will be used.
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                           35


       3.7.2.1. The HP project will include a requirement for co-location of AF and PMO staff.
       All cost associated with relocation, furnishings & communications for the Government
       housing staff will be funded with P-721 MFH appropriations. Co-location solutions will
       be monitored and included in project reports during annual site visits by AFCEE/HP. For
       more information on funds, see AFMAN 65-604.
3.8. Project Financials.
   3.8.1. Reserve and Escrow Accounts. Project solicitation documents and transaction
   documents require the PO to set up a Lockbox Account with interest bearing subaccounts to
   provide for (a) operation of the property IAW terms and provisions of the Air Force lease, (b)
   demolition, rehabilitation, construction and other work comprising the project, (c) funding of
   certain accounts described herein for the continued maintenance of the property as required
   by the Air Force lease and (d) timely repayment of the construction, permanent and direct
   Government loans and the payment of certain related fees and expenses. All project
   revenues are required to flow through the lockbox accounts. Project receipts and loan
   proceeds (other than construction loan proceeds) must be deposited into accounts created and
   governed by a Lockbox Agreement to which the Government, all lenders and the PO are
   parties.
   3.8.2. Taxes. The PO is solely responsibility for project taxes. Transaction documents may
   also state PO responsibilities for funds if a tax savings is realized.
   3.8.3. Government Financing.
       3.8.3.1. The Air Force may provide a Government Direct Loan (GDL) at or below the
       project year-budgeted Treasury rate or other government financing (loan guarantees,
       differential lease payments, etc.) in accordance with the MHPI authorities and AF/A7C,
       SAF/IEI, SAF/FM, OSD and OMB policies. AFCEE will justify the need for
       government financing to SAF/IEI (and the ESG), who will approve the government
       financing as part of the concept and award approval process, or when changes to the
       approved financing are required due to market or other conditions.
       3.8.3.2. The PO is responsible for financing HP construction. The Air Force does not
       provide a Government loan for construction financing; however, at the end of
       construction or at the end of a construction phase, the Government disburses all or part of
       the Government direct loan, if applicable.
       3.8.3.3. Net Operating Income (NOI) from existing units conveyed to the PO by the Air
       Force is considered a Government contribution to the project until the units are renovated
       or demolished. The pro forma and scoring report must demonstrate the NOI from
       existing units is fully used in funding of construction or renovation during the Initial
       Development Period (IDP).

   the period of occupancy unless otherwise stated in project legal documents or signed
   tenant/rental agreement.
   4.1.3. Military-married-to-military. For this category of tenants, rent is based on the BAH
   with-dependent rate of the highest ranking member.
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                          37


  4.1.4. Unaccompanied Dependents Restricted (UDR) Tour. If family members apply at an
  installation other than that of the follow-on or home-basing assignment of the sponsor, they
  are considered Other Eligible Tenants IAW the transaction closing documents and are
  charged at the with-dependent rate BAH. For more information see AFI 32-6001.
  4.1.5. Eligibility Verification Process. The HMO is required to verify the eligibility of all
  potential tenants. The PO must receive validation of eligibility from the HMO before
  finalizing a lease with a potential tenant. The following documentation should be verified by
  the HMO to determine eligibility for Target Tenants and Other Eligible Tenant (OET):
     4.1.5.1. Target Tenant - valid military identification (ID) and copy of Permanent Change
     of Station (PCS) orders.

  4.1.6. All Target Tenants and OET categories must complete AF Form 4422, Sex Offender
  Disclosure and Acknowledgement Form, in accordance with guidance established in AFI 32-
  6001, Family Housing Management. The HMO will ensure the disclosure form is completed
  before the PO finalizes a lease with a tenant. The HMO will provide written or electronic
  documentation of the tenant’s validation to PO.
  4.1.7. OET Category Placement. Transaction documents specify the order of priority for
  Other Eligible Tenants, identify triggers to offer units to Other Eligible Tenants, and specify
  the process to implement the other eligible tenant list. Transaction documents also specify:
     4.1.7.1. According to the project transaction documents, the PO may immediately rent to
     the first priority of OET, Category 1 and 2 (See Table 4.2), when the occupancy rate
     drops below 95 percent.
 38                                                   AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


        4.1.7.2. The Commander may agree, on a case-by-case basis, to permit Other Eligible
        Tenants to occupy vacant units if Target Tenants do not require the units, even though
        more than 95 percent of the units are occupied. The Commander may also waive 30-day
        requirement between the Other Eligible Tenant categories (See Table 4.2, Other Eligible
        Tenants (OET) and Category) if waitlists exist.
        4.1.7.3. Leases for Other Eligible Tenants are generally limited to one year. At the end
        of the lease term, the PO and HMO will discuss extension eligibility.
        4.1.7.4. The PO offers units to Other Eligible Tenants in the order specified in Table 4.2.

Table 4.2. Other Eligible Tenants (OET) and Category.

Upon 90 consecutive days of         Category 7       General Public
occupancy below 95 percent

Note: For Category 2 personnel above, first priority should be given to Key and Essential positions
including Wing, Group and Squadron Commanders and Command Chief Master Sergeants assigned to a
tenant organization on the installation. Dual status individuals (Air Reserve Technicians) will be prioritized
based on military rank unless otherwise stated in project transaction documents.

4.2. Background Checks. The Access Integrity Unit of the FBI’s Office of General Counsel
has determined civilians applying for residence in privatized housing on military installations fall
within the scope of previous authorizations for using the National Crime Information Center
(NCIC) and the Interstate Identification Index (III). As a result, the installation Security Forces
Squadron are authorized on behalf of the AF to and will conduct all name-only background
checks (name checks) on those persons applying for housing on military installations, and
current individuals already residing in housing on military installations who have not already
been subject to a background check (FBI reference Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 09-12,
Interim Policy Guidance for DoD Physical Access Control, 08 Dec 2009). Additionally, refer to
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                            39


AFI 31-113, Installation Perimeter Access Control, for guidance on AF installation access
procedures and HP credentialing categories.
   4.2.1. Name checks may only be performed once (considered “visitors”) for privatized
   housing residents and not on a regular basis for site security purposes. However, subsequent
   name checks may be authorized if there is reasonable suspicion/probable cause to suspect
   criminal activity. Installations will consult with their servicing Staff Judge Advocate when
   making these decisions.
   4.2.2. The Commander will provide specific procedures for access credential issuance
   implementation at the installation IAW applicable DoD, AF and MAJCOM policies, to
   include:
       4.2.2.1. Access credentials will only be issued by following an approved identity
       proofing process which utilizes the NCIC; the CONUS authoritative database for
       determining fitness of an individual for entry onto an AF installation.
       4.2.2.2. One valid DoD credential, or other valid local access credential, as approved by
       the installation commander, is sufficient for entry to an AF installation.
       4.2.2.3. Installation commanders will determine escort privileges based on validated
       needs.
       4.2.2.4. Local Civil Engineering Squadron or Capital Asset Manager must sponsor
       individuals in HP OET categories that do not have DoD issued identification, and must
       conform to applicable CAC or local credentialing standards.
4.3. Referrals.
   4.3.1. Eligible Target Tenants assigned to the local area are required on their PCS orders to
   process through the HMO upon arrival and receive information about all available housing in
   the local area, including Government-controlled, privatized and community housing, as well
   as related community services. Housing Asset Manager assures referrals and/or information
   concerning privatized housing is IAW specific legal documents and requirements. Eligible
   applicants who are interested in or desire to live in privatized housing will be referred to PH.
   The PO/PMO is responsible for advertising to prospective tenants. The Housing Asset
   Manager should coordinate and partner with the PMO to ensure sufficient advertisement to
   potential tenants.
   4.3.2. Target Tenants, unless K&E, must be given freedom of housing choice at all times,
   except where restrictive sanctions are in effect in the community. Housing Asset Managers,
   to ensure applicants may make an informed decision on HP, will brief applicants on the
   benefits of PH.
   4.3.3. HMOs may provide applicant information to the privatized housing PMO IAW
   paragraph 12.2, AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, to assist in forecasting available homes
   for leasing.
   4.3.4. HMO will provide all incoming personnel email or written notifications of PO/PMO
   contact information.
   4.3.5. Occupancy Rates for determining Other Eligible Tenants (OETs) placement are
   included in transaction documents, which specify when houses are considered unavailable or
 40                                           AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   included in the vacancy calculation for implementation of the OET placement. However,
   generally Occupancy Rates are determined by dividing the total number of occupied
   available HP units by the total number of available HP units in the inventory (Table 4.2).
   Units are considered unavailable when:
       4.3.5.1. Unit is or is forecast to be unavailable for 30 or more days for repair or
       maintenance.
       4.3.5.2. Unit does not meet standards IAW transaction documents.
       4.3.5.3. Unit is excluded by mutual agreement between the PO and the Government,
       IAW transaction documents.
       4.3.5.4. Unit is new construction or renovated that has not yet been accepted by the Air
       Force for occupancy via an Acceptance Notice or equivalent.
       4.3.5.5. Unit has been taken out of inventory due to impending renovation or demolition.
4.4. Applications. The housing application process should comply with the transaction
documents, and installation-specific processing requirements.
   4.4.1. The HMO uses information on DD Form 1746, Application for Assignment to
   Housing, for referral purposes. However, members choosing privatized or community
   housing may also be required to complete an application specific to the HP.
   4.4.2. Members may contact the PO/PMO to submit an advance application for privatized
   housing.
          4.4.2.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) The C2 E-mail address will be provided at lease
          signing or NLT 30 days after lease signing. E-mails will be used in conjunction with
          other C2 means such as Giant Voice, radio, television or telephone alerts whenever
          available.
          4.4.2.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) If the provided C2 E-mail address becomes
          unusable (e.g., full mailbox, inactive address, etc.), the sponsor will provide a
          replacement E-mail address within 30 days to Hunt Management.
          4.4.2.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) E-mails sent via Vance C2 will inform or direct
          housing residents regarding the situation(s) at hand. Housing residents are expected
          to comply with issued directives.
       4.4.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) Hardship requests for priority placement into PH will be
       submitted to the HMO. The 71 MSG/CC is the approval/disapproval authority to request
       priority placement in PH for members with an approved hardship. HMO will coordinate
       and route requests to the 71 MSG/CC for approval/disapproval to request Hunt provide
       priority placement on the appropriate wait list for the member with a hardship.
       4.4.4. (Added-VANCEAFB) In order for the 71 FTW to maintain proper Command
       and Control (C2) for members and families residing in base housing, each sponsor will
       provide Hunt Management at least one E-mail address to allow contact between the wing
       and their household via Vance C2 messages.
4.5. Waiting Lists. The PO/PMO will maintain the HP waiting list based on tenant eligibility
IAW transaction documents and Privacy Act requirements.
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                          41


       4.5.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) HMO will determine which wait list a member will be
       placed on. Members will be placed on the appropriate wait list for their grade category,
       using the criteria of one bedroom per child.
       4.5.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Approval/disapproval authority for requests from Hunt to
       enact the exhausted wait list procedures is the 71 MSG/CC. The Housing Asset Manager
       may approve requests to enact the exhausted wait list procedures for requests not
       involving mixing enlisted and officers within categories.
4.6. Tenant Lease Agreements. The PO has sole responsibility for entering into a lease
agreement with tenants authorized to live in HP. The PO will give first priority to Target
Tenants (Table 4.1). Leases will contain appropriate requirements for pet policies to include
deposits, acceptable breeds and density (number of animals per unit). The transaction documents
provide a list of pre-approved addendums for use; additionally, Delegations of Authority
documents provide further guidance for lease amendments/addendums.
4.7. Privatized Housing Community Integrity (Rank Segregation). Maintaining military
tradition in military housing communities necessitates rank segregation between the Officer and
Enlisted housing areas. Exceptions to this policy are permitted to mitigate the need to pursue
Other Eligible Tenants to maximize occupancy. In order to promote military member residency
while ensuring privatized housing projects remain financially viable, Installation Commanders
should support reasonable integration of Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) and Officers (to
include quarters within the same roof configuration). In doing so, the Installation Commander’s
authority to take necessary actions to maintain good order and discipline is not impaired.
Consideration for applicable project transaction documents must also be considered. Housing
community integration may occur when:
   4.7.1. Overall occupancy of privatized housing falls below 95% and the occupant waterfall
   is enacted. Specifically, when no eligible Active Duty, Guard, or Reserve military members
   are available on the waiting list and willing to immediately move into vacant housing
   following 30 consecutive days of occupancy below 95%.
   4.7.2. Rank integrity will be restored as soon as possible. In such cases, allowing the
   integration of NCOs and officers may reduce the requirement to pursue further waterfall
   actions necessary to achieve maximum occupancy.
4.8. Retention and Lease Termination.
   4.8.1. Retention.
       4.8.1.1. Members must terminate their HP lease when they are no longer eligible for PH
       unless retention is approved or the project is in the Other Eligible Tenant category
       placement to the point of the tenant’s new eligibility. Refer to transaction documents and
       tenant lease for continued eligibility, the process to request continued occupancy and
       termination procedures.
       4.8.1.2. Tenant or family member may request HP retention for tenant status changes for
       situations including hardship situations or death of the military member, as per
       transaction documents.
          4.8.1.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) Retention of quarters requests for PH will be
          submitted to the HMO. Approval/disapproval authority for retention of quarters is
 42                                           AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


          the 71 MSG/CC. The Housing Asset Manager may approve requests for retention of
          quarters requests in PH for target tenants who are PCSing from Vance AFB but not
          separating from military service. HMO will coordinate and route to the 71 MSG/CC
          for approval/disapproval for members who will no longer be on active duty and for
          non-target tenants.
   4.8.2. Lease Termination.
      4.8.2.1. Title 37 U.S.C. §403 provides for continuation of BAH to dependents of a
      military member who dies while on active duty for 365 days after the date of the
      member’s death. Therefore, dependents of a member who dies on active duty, and whose
      family lives in PH, should be advised to contact the PO/PMO to discuss eligibility to
      terminate or extend their lease in these circumstances.
      4.8.2.2. Tenancy may be terminated by the PO if a member/tenant does not abide by the
      signed tenant lease stipulations. For disputed matters, military members may request
      informal assistance from the HMO, or formal legal assistance through the installation
      JAG office.
4.9. Key and Essential (K&E) Personnel, and Command and Special Command Positions
(SCP).
   4.9.1. CSAF, MAJCOM and Installation Commanders may require K&E personnel,
   including incumbents of command positions, to reside on the installation as a condition of
   employment, when incumbent is required to respond to continual operational requirements or
   emergencies, and off-base residency would adversely impact the installation readiness, safety
   and security or health and welfare of the base population. The Commander may designate
   specific PH for personnel as indicated in AFI 32-6001 or AFI 32-6003 and/or in accordance
   with the project’s transaction documents. K&E personnel include civilian personnel who are
   required to live on base as a condition of their employment and whose positions are
   identified in a base supplement to AFI 32-6001. Civilian K&E personnel will pay rent equal
   to military members of equivalent grade and be subject to lease terms equivalent to those of
   military members of equivalent grade. Single/unaccompanied K&E civilian personnel will
   pay rent based on the without-dependent BAH rate of their equivalent military grade.
          4.9.1.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) When housing is not immediately available, K&E
          personnel will be placed at the top of the appropriate PH waiting list and will be
          offered the next available unit without displacing members with a firm housing
          commitment. K&E personnel are not authorized a turndown when offered a unit in
          PH.
   4.9.2. Extraordinary Costs and Expenditures (EC&E). The PO should consult with the
   Housing Asset Manager and Commander on requests from tenants for project improvements.
   No member of any rank has the authority to direct the PO to expend funds. The PO may not
   be directed to spend any unbudgeted funds and must report expenditures that exceed $50,000
   annually on any house to AFCEE/HP. Key stakeholders must fully understand the concept
   of Extraordinary Cost & Expenditures (EC&E) and quarterly expenditure reporting.
   AFCEE/HP notifies SAF/IEI of unreasonable EC&E based on dollar value, purpose and
   frequency. (See 5.6.8 and Terms and AFI 32-6003 for more on EC&E). All required GO
   reports are identified in AFI 32-6003.
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                            43


4.10. Prestige Housing (E-9). The HRMA determines maximum number of E-9 Prestige
Housing. The transaction documents will identify all E-9 housing as Prestige Housing (AFI 32-
6001).
4.11. Rental Payments. The Housing Asset Manager assists the PO/PMO and military member
with preparation, submission and any general issues pertaining to allotments, as required. The
PO may use a third party allotment processing company to assist tenants with completing
allotments and tracking payments for the PO, at project expense. The Housing Asset Manager
forwards other allotments to appropriate financing centers for Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines,
Coast Guard, AFRC, ANG and other agencies. Air Force policy is for rent for Target Tenants to
be paid in arrears, and to equal the amount of the BAH rate received by the military member, less
the utility allowance (110 percent of the estimated cost of utilities). If K&E personnel are single
or unaccompanied, they shall pay rent based on the without-dependents BAH rate. Other rent
payment arrangements for military members may be used depending on project-specific
transaction documents and the policy in effect at the time of the transaction closing. HMO
should assist PO/PMO with any issues regarding allotments. Rental payment for other tenants
are governed by the transaction documents, but rent for active duty military members will equal
to the BAH of the installation to which they are assigned, minus the utility allowance.
4.12. Utilities Costs and Allowances. Utility allowance is calculated for each house type and is
based on 110 percent of the average consumption. The utility allowance is recalculated annually
and rents are adjusted accordingly, IAW transaction documents.
       4.12.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Approval/disapproval              authority    for   the    annual
       recalculated utility allowance rates is the 71 MSG/CC.
4.13. Local Drayage, Nontemporary Storage (NTS). Government-directed local moves and
NTS into and out of PH are authorized in JFTR Volume 1, Chapter 5, Part D, paragraph U5355,
Section B. A Government-directed local move is authorized prior to project closing for MFH
residents who choose not to sign a lease with the PO after having been notified in writing by the
Installation Commander of their housing options upon FH privatization (e.g., sign a lease with
the PH Project Owner, vacate FH and move to the local community, etc.). Members are entitled
to one local Government-paid move into PH after PCS. Subsequent moves into PH for
convenience of the member are at member expense. For more guidance, refer to AFI 32-6001.
   4.13.1. MAJCOMs may determine a reasonable timeframe for these moves in advance of
   transaction closing. Moves authorized and certified, but not initiated prior to transaction
   closing due to no fault of the member or family members, are still honored. This includes the
   inability of Traffic Management Office (TMO) to schedule the contracted move to occur
   before closing. A member who does not complete an authorized Government-paid move
   prior to closing, unless exempted above, is subject to PO terms and conditions of occupancy
   and local landlord/tenant law.
   4.13.2. HP military tenants are entitled to one Government-funded move after project
   closing specifically to facilitate construction, renovation and demolition IAW the approved
   construction phasing and transition plan. Additional moves for PO benefit are at project
   expense. The Housing Asset Manager verifies when the PO pays for drayage IAW
   transaction documents.
 44                                           AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


       4.13.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) When the member receives the signed copy of the AF
       Form 150, Drayage/Storage Authorization - Government Quarters, for either drayage or
       storage; the member must report to the local TMO within 7 calendar days. Failure to do
       so will result in cancellation of the drayage or storage order.
4.14. Cable, Telephone and Reimbursements. The Government reimburses reconnection and
reinstallation fees when the associated local move is a Government-directed move into and out of
PH (see 4.13). The transaction documents specify when the PO is responsible for reimbursing
the tenant for telephone and cable reconnection fees. The Housing Asset Manager verifies the
PO pays the reconnection fees IAW transaction documents.
4.15. Appropriated Funds (APF). APF may not be used to support HP assets or infrastructure
except where specifically authorized by legislation. APF may not be used to purchase United
States, state, Air Force or other flags for PH, for funding Maintenance and Repair (M&R) or
modification, or for related PH expense, except for the following items:
   4.15.1. Communications Support. Readily removable Government AT/FP and
   communications equipment is funded with non-MFH funds. Systems must be installed and
   maintained in accordance with transaction closing documents. Refer to AFI 32-6003 for
   Communications Support requirements in GOHs.
   4.15.2. As with Government-controlled housing, FH APF (operations funds, P-721) may be
   used to purchase supplemental furnishings for PH occupied by eligible personnel (SCP,
   General Officers, O-6 installation commanders, CMSAF) as prescribed by AFI 32-6003.
4.16. Antiterrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP). Transaction documents specify PO
responsibilities for AT/FP requirements known at the time of closing. In the event that AT/FP
requirements have not been identified for a closed PH project, or new AT/FP requirements arise
after a PH project has closed, the Air Force may attempt to renegotiate with the PO for an
amendment to the transaction documents to require compliance with specific AT/FP
requirements. The Commander must advise the PO of all future AT/FP requirements and
tenancy changes.
   4.16.1. AT/FP Requirements and Funding. AT/FP requirements for any building or other
   improvement in a PH project may not be authorized and funded with MFH APF (MFH M&R
   P-722). AT/FP project requirements are identified by the installation using resources such as
   a higher headquarters or installation documented vulnerability assessments (VA).
       4.16.1.1. AT/FP construction requirements must be IAW appropriate Unified Facilities
       Criteria (UFC). AT/FP construction requirements must be included in the project for
       community facilities or when more than 12 housing units are combined into one building.
       During the planning and development phases, AT/FP requirements identified and
       validated must be specified in the project solicitation and transaction documents as the
       responsibility of the PO and all costs accounted for in project financials. The
       Commander, using the installation MRC as a forum, retains AT/FP responsibility. The
       installation reviews project siting, considering law enforcement response and force
       protection capability (AFI 10-245, Air Force Antiterrorism (AT) Standards).
       4.16.1.2. On-base PH receives the same AT/FP as Government-controlled FH. The
       Commander may use the MRC to address specific installation access issues of individuals
       housed from the other eligible tenant category placement (paragraph 4.1), including
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                           45


       threat or AT/FP conditions. During installation lock-down for FP conditions, all
       residents will be provided access as appropriate and defined by FPCON.
       4.16.1.3. Installation transaction documents specify actions necessary if PH is not
       located on installation proper.
       4.16.1.4. Project solicitation and transaction documents specify that local law
       enforcement provide security in off-base PH areas. If a specific threat is imminent,
       (depending on the nature of the threat), Security Forces may provide additional protection
       to PH based on established jurisdiction.
4.17. Commercial Activities in Privatized Housing (PH). Commercial activities are defined
as business enterprises conducted for profit by family members and are permitted in PH IAW
mandatory tenant lease clauses. Family child care in PH is generally permitted by the mandatory
tenant lease clauses, and the PO is the approval authority. The tenant must comply with
standards for child care in AFI 34-276, Family Child Care Programs and all parties must comply
with the tenant lease agreement. When PH is located on non-federal land and within city limits,
certain fees, code compliance and community regulations may apply.
       4.17.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Approval/disapproval         authority         for   commercial
       businesses conducted on base from PH is the 71 MSG/CC.
          4.17.1.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Member submits a written request to conduct
          commercial business in assigned PH to the HMO. The member must sign and date
          the Vance AFB Commercial Business Operation Policy Statement (Attachment 4)
          and complete the attached coordination sheet. The HMO will staff the request to the
          71 MSG/CC for approval. The request should include the following information:
          4.17.1.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) An explanation of the type of business; the name
          of the business, member's address and home phone number.
          4.17.1.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) The following restrictions apply to all approved
          commercial business activities:
              4.17.1.3.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Appointments will not be made with nor will
              solicitation be made to military personnel who are in “on-duty” status.
              4.17.1.3.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Door-to-door solicitation is prohibited on
              Vance AFB to include, but not limited to, housing, dormitories and transit
              quarters.
              4.17.1.3.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) No solicitation without appointment will be
              made in areas utilized for the housing or processing of transient personnel, in
              dormitories, unit areas, in the PH area or in areas provided by installation
              commanders for interviews by appointment.
              4.17.1.3.4. (Added-VANCEAFB) Oral or written representation to suggest or
              give the appearance that the Department of Defense sponsors or endorses any
              particular company, its agents, or the goods, services and commodities it sells will
              not be used.
              4.17.1.3.5. (Added-VANCEAFB) Members and their dependents/family
              members conducting commercial business activities will not enter into any
46                                            AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


           unauthorized or restricted area.
           4.17.1.3.6. (Added-VANCEAFB) Members must maintain a reasonable amount
           of liability insurance based on the type of business being conducted. A lawn care
           business would not need as much liability insurance as someone dealing with
           food, providing home day care, etc.
           4.17.1.3.7. (Added-VANCEAFB) Members receiving approval must apply for a
           State of Oklahoma Business License. The business will not be allowed to start
           until after a copy of the receipt for the license is provided to the Hunt Housing
           Office. A copy of the official business license must be provided to Hunt within
           15 days of receipt.
     4.17.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) Approval/disapproval authority for requests to employ a
     live-in childcare provider (nanny) is the 71 MSG/CC.

           4.17.2.1.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) The name and age of your dependent child
           (children) who reside full-time in member's household.
           4.17.2.1.4. (Added-VANCEAFB) The member must show they are able to
           provide the nanny with their own bedroom in PH unit with the understanding that
           an approved request will not represent an additional bedroom requirement.
           4.17.2.1.5. (Added-VANCEAFB) The member will not allow the nanny to enter
           into any unauthorized or controlled areas.
           4.17.2.1.6. (Added-VANCEAFB) The member will meet all federal, state and
           local domestic employment laws and contracts.
           4.17.2.1.7. (Added-VANCEAFB) The member must contact 71 SFS to initiate
           an Installation Access Application. The Live-In Childcare Provider (nanny) will
           provide full name, date of birth, and driver’s license/state of issue must consent to
           a background investigation, and must be able to acquire unescorted access to the
           installation before the MSG/CC approves the authorization.
           4.17.2.1.8. (Added-VANCEAFB) The member must maintain a reasonable
           amount of liability insurance to cover personal injuries the nanny may incur.
           Proof of insurance will be provided to Hunt within 30 days of approval of your

               until after a copy of the receipt for the license is provided to the Hunt Housing
               Office. A copy of the official business license must be provided to Hunt within
               15 days of receipt.
4.18. Self-Help. The PO may provide self-help guidance in the tenant lease and Housing
Resident Guide, if a self-help facility is provided for the project. Tenants’ use of the base APF
self-help facility is not authorized.
4.19. Insurance Coverage. The project solicitation shall specify the PO is responsible for real
property damage and liability coverage. If tenant rental insurance is provided as a desired
feature by the project, the PO/PMO will advise all tenants of limits and claims procedures.
4.20. Federal Assistance Programs:
   4.20.1. If the Federal Government transfers (or conveys) title to tax-exempt land to the PO,
   the land is no longer considered federal property for Impact Aid purposes and the school
   district receives low-level Impact Aid for children living in housing on that property when a
   parent is on active duty.
   4.20.2. If the Federal Government retains title to land and leases the land to a private PO, the
   land remains federal property for Impact Aid purposes. Local school districts will continue
   to calculate Impact Aid based on the number of eligible children living in PH on this land,
   even if the housing is owned by the PO and subject to state and local taxation.
   4.20.3. BAH is categorized as income on members Leave and Earnings Statement. This
   change may affect their eligibility for the Food Stamp Program. To assist military members,
   the FY2001 National Defense Authorization Act (Title 37 U.S.C. §402a and Executive Order
   9397) established the Family Subsistence Supplemental Allowance (FSSA) (Food Stamp
   Program) to provide members not receiving food stamps an amount of money required to
   bring their income to 130 percent of the federal poverty line, not to exceed $500 per month.
   Refer members to Family Support Services/Airmen and Family Readiness for more
   information or to the FSSA Web site at A5.13 for the online application.
4.21. Marketing Privatized Housing (PH). The Housing Asset Manager assists in marketing
the PH project to the extent possible without violating applicable laws, as it is in the best interest
of the Air Force and PO for the project to be successful. Refer to the Stakeholder Outreach Plan
and the HP Communications Toolbox, maintained by AFCEE/HP, for marketing guidance.
4.22. Pet Policy. AF housing policy establishes pet standards for all installations. Commanders
must ensure their staffs partner with the PO to incorporate these standards to privatized housing
projects. See AFI 32-6001 for guidance.
       4.22.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Approval/disapproval authority for exception to policy
       requests for pets to be boarded on the installation is the 71 MSG/CC.
           4.22.1.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Exception to policy requests are submitted to the
           HMO. The HMO will staff the request to the 71 MSG/CC for approval/disapproval.
           Members must obtain a separate approval from Hunt to have the pet in PH. If either
           request is disapproved, member may not board the pet.
       4.22.2. (Added-VANCEAFB) If a grandfathered pet changes owners, the grandfather
       clause no longer applies.
 48                                            AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


       4.22.3. (Added-VANCEAFB) All pets must be registered with the base veterinarian
       NLT 30 days after the pet's move-in date.
           4.22.3.1. (Added-VANCEAFB) Members obtaining new pets while residing in PH
           must provide Hunt with the information required for pets in their lease within 7 days
           of the pet's move-in date.

Section 4B—Oversight and Compliance.

4.23. Oversight. The Housing Asset Manager provides quality oversight of project
performance using a partnering methodology and understanding that the level of project
performance should dictate the level of oversight required. See 1.25 for more information on
oversight responsibilities and 4.27 related specific tasks. Transaction documents also prescribe
procedures for dispute resolution.
4.24. Demographic Changes:
   4.24.1. The Housing Asset Manager reviews demographics with the PO/PMO and forwards
   recommendations for demographic changes to the Commander for coordination, prior to
   assisting the PO in the request to AFCEE for demographic change (AFI 32-6001, paragraph
   9.8 and 9.10).
   4.24.2. Varying demographics generally do not require a change to transaction documents.
   The mix of available homes in the PH complex and rent structure must ensure Government
   flexibility in referral of Target Tenants to the project.
   4.24.3. Because the project income stream is based on the total income anticipated from the
   original project target demographics, ideally, adjustments are made to minimize vacancy
   rates and maintain positive income stream for the project.
   4.24.4. When required by changing demographics, the installation coordinates any change
   requests to reflect correct mix of available homes in PH project in transaction documents
   with AFCEE/HP. Unless there are potential legal or safety impediments, the Government
   should support occupancy of Other Eligible Tenants and waive rank separation to maximize
   the health of the project.
4.25. Change of Occupancy Maintenance (COM) Standards. COM is minor M&R required
to make the unit ready for the next occupant. Identify repairs during the pre-termination and
final inspection to ensure consistency in COM implementation. For more information on COM
standards refer to AFI 32-6001 and project final transaction documents.
4.26. Compliance Testing Processes. The processes involve direct liaison between the PMO
and the Housing Asset Manager to coordinate observations, results and reports. Completed
compliance testing checklists are submitted to the AF Portfolio Manager on a quarterly basis.
The Housing Asset Manager should use the compliance-testing tool as their operating
procedures. See 4.27 Compliance Tasks for more information.
   4.26.1. AFCEE/HP will conduct periodic compliance reviews of all closed HP projects. This
   function may involve direct and indirect verification of certain compliance items as well as
   coordinating the efforts of legal, engineering, environmental, and other installation functions,
   as applicable, to ensure timely and accurate reporting to the Air Force Portfolio Manager.
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                           49


   4.26.2. At a minimum, AFCEE/HP will maintain records adequate to demonstrate
   compliance verification was accomplished.
4.27. Compliance Tasks. The installation Housing Asset Manager assures that appropriate
compliance testing has been accomplished and will maintain records adequate to demonstrate
compliance. Consider the following items for inclusion into the Compliance Testing Tool (Note:
the Compliance Tool is developed by AFCEE and includes all the requirements within the
transaction documents):
   4.27.1. Provide random oversight of maintenance work orders to ensure compliance with
   transaction documents.
   4.27.2. Provide random oversight of occupancy initial, pre-termination and final inspections.
   4.27.3. Verify compliance with Davis Bacon Wage Act criteria, as required.
   4.27.4. Assist with and coordinate prepared communications with wing leadership, as
   necessary.
   4.27.5. Provide random oversight to assure appropriate preventive maintenance and capital
   repairs are accomplished IAW approved Facilities Maintenance and CR&R plans
   respectively.

                                           Chapter 5

                      PHASE III: POST-CLOSING MANAGEMENT

5.1. Step 1: Project Management. The Capital Asset Manager, in coordination with the HMO,
is the primary focal point for installation activities related to MHPI and closed HP projects. For
successful project oversight and closing, support from other BCE and installation agencies is
necessary, as follows:
   5.1.1. While resource requirements vary, an effective Asset Management team includes an
   Asset Manager and a Capital or Housing Asset Manager to coordinate the HP project effort
   with the PO/PMO, Financial Services Officer, Environmental, Judge Advocate (JA), Security
   Forces, Public Affairs and other agencies as appropriate.
   5.1.2. The Housing Asset Manager and AFCEE/HP coordinate the PO annual budget
   submission IAW transaction documents. AFCEE/HP provides a letter of review and a
   recommendation for approval/disapproval to the approval authority (AFCEE/CL) and
   attaches a copy of the budget submission.
   5.1.3. After project closure, AF Asset Managers will continue to incorporate guidance in
   Chapter 4, Housing Asset Management,s for unimpaired project management.
5.2. Management Review Committee (MRC). The Commander or Vice Commander
establishes and co-chairs the MRC with the PO for single-base HP projects IAW transaction
documents and other established guidance, as a forum to facilitate discussions related to the
Project. At single command group projects, the MAJCOM and PO co-chair the MRC. AFCEE
and PO co-chair multiple Command grouped projects.
   5.2.1. The MRC is conducted IAW the transaction documents and other established
   guidance as a forum to facilitate discussions related to the project. Other Government
   representatives include, but are not limited to, AFCEE/HP, BCE, MAJCOM and installation
   Housing Asset Manager, Security Forces, Fire Department, Public Affairs, Judge Advocate’s
   Office and tenant representatives where applicable.
   5.2.2. The MRC meets at least quarterly through the Initial Development Period (IDP) and
   no less than semi-annually throughout the remainder of the lease term, but may meet as often
   as required to promote a positive working relationship among all stakeholders.
   5.2.3. HMO may brief, among other issues; PEP report, CEL survey results, site visits
   conducted, project ratings, occupancy, construction progress, and any proposals or
   compliance issues that require further discussion
   5.2.4. Partnering Meetings. The Commander ensures partnering meetings are held to
   provide an informal round table discussion to resolve local and day-to-day issues at the
   lowest level possible. Weekly meetings are recommended between the HMO/PMO Team.
   After the IDP, the Commander may determine the frequency of partnering meetings.
5.3. HP Project Scope Changes After Award. Scope changes that are not driven by building
codes, law and safety during the construction and renovation period are rare due to the stringent
legal transaction documents agreed to by all parties. Requests that exceed Air Force housing
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                           51


design and construction standards, validated and approved by applicable HRMA or HCP may not
be considered during the IDP.
   5.3.1. The installation and MAJCOM Asset Managers coordinate on recommended changes
   affecting the project and forward the changes to the AFCEE/HP for review and coordination.
   5.3.2. AFCEE/HP forwards recommended transaction document changes to AF/A7CH for
   review against FHMP and HRMA/HCP documents and coordination with SAF/IEI to obtain
   approval or disapproval.
5.4. Design and Construction Management. The Resident Construction Manager (RCM)
represents AFCEE at each construction site and is responsible for ensuring construction is
conducted in compliance with transaction closing documents. The RCM coordinates actions
with the installation for staffing and concurrence on significant design changes affecting the
project. The RCM keeps stakeholders informed of construction status via weekly and monthly
construction reports that are posted to AFPACES.
   5.4.1. The RCM reviews the PO final plans and specifications IAW transaction documents.
   Upon confirmation that final plans meet design criteria, the AF Portfolio Manager issues the
   PO a Notice to Proceed before construction may begin.
   5.4.2. The PO is responsible for providing their own quality control and construction
   inspection to ensure compliance with transaction documents, federal, state and local laws and
   construction codes. The RCM provides construction oversight only to the level necessary to
   ensure compliance with the transaction closing documents. But for Federal responsibilities
   that cannot be delegated to the PO, the AF does not augment or supplement PO compliance
   responsibilities with building construction codes or federal, state and local laws. Funding for
   construction oversight is limited and managed by AF/A7CH.
   5.4.3. At the end of each construction phase, and/or as units are available for occupancy,
   transaction documents require the PO to obtain a Certificate of Compliance from the AF to
   confirm all construction and documentation requirements are met. As part of this process,
   the PO also obtains a Certificate of Occupancy (or equivalent document) from the local
   municipality (if required) or other qualified independent third party construction consultant
   to certify that homes and other facilities constructed or renovated as part of the project meet
   applicable building codes and the transaction design documents.
   5.4.4. Post-Closing Construction Management (PCCM). Involves assessments of project
   construction budget, scope, and schedule during IDP to identify risk elements, recommend
   mitigation strategies and identify best practices.
       5.4.4.1. Assessments are conducted by AFCEE during periodic Development Review
       Visits (DRVs) to the project sites.
       5.4.4.2. RCMs track action items stemming from the DRV and provide updates in
       monthly construction reports.
5.5. Step 2: Portfolio Management. Executed at AFCEE/HP, Portfolio Management ensures
expedient and direct lines of communication with stakeholders. The Portfolio Management role
includes oversight of both AF and private sector performance.
   5.5.1. Portfolio Management may engage directly with all stakeholders, ensuring adherence
   to established AF internal coordination requirements, on issues relating to the performance of
 52                                            AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   the project in order to protect the Government’s interest. Stakeholders, include but are not
   limited to SAF/IEI, SAF/GCN, AF/A7C, Asset Managers, Housing Asset Managers,
   MAJCOMs, lockbox agents, POs, PMOs, senior lenders, bondholder representatives,
   insurance brokers, DFAS and other private or Governmental entities. Functions of the AF
   Portfolio Manager include, but are not limited to:
       5.5.1.1. Notification of significant events, such as annual site visits and material project
       issues to the installation, MAJCOM and AF/A7CH.
       5.5.1.2. Communication of information on defaults or potential default issues directly to
       the installation Asset Manager, MAJCOM, AF/A7CH, and through established AF
       internal coordination channels SAF/FMC, SAF/GCN and SAF/IEI, as well as during
       ESG meetings to above-referenced and all other ESG stakeholders.
       5.5.1.3. Verification that all accounts are maintained and funds disbursed IAW lockbox
       agreements.      Validation of PO requests regarding funds disbursement and
       reimbursements from lockbox accounts.
       5.5.1.4. PO Capital Repair and Replacement (CR&R) Plan and Budget. The PO prepares
       the CR&R Plan and Budget and submits to the Government and the Lender as part of the
       preliminary Project Budget for each FY. The CR&R Plan and Budget, (1) identifies
       projected CR&R requirements for the Project, with anticipated funding sources for the
       50-year term of the Government Lease, and (2) explains any variances from the CR&R
       Plan for the prior FY. In general, PO fiscal years are calendar years, but may vary, refer
       to project documents for verification.
5.6. Portfolio Reporting Requirements. The AF Portfolio Manager prepares a variety of
reports for various stakeholders to include the PEP report, which is comprised of the Program
Executive Summary and Project Summary Reports (PSR). Reports are completed with the
assistance and input from the installation Housing Asset Manager.
   5.6.1. The PEP report must be completed within timelines established for the reporting
   period. Most information for the PEP report is sourced from the PO. However, the
   installation provides certain Government sourced data points as well as narratives relating to
   project performance. All of this information must be delivered to Portfolio Management
   within the timeframes established by Portfolio Management to facilitate timely, accurate and
   informative quarterly reports.
   5.6.2. Annual Reforecast Report. Prepared for each project and the portfolio and utilizes
   historical performance and revised forward looking assumptions to assess future risks to the
   Government's financial interests and policy objectives.
   5.6.3. Scorecard. Assessment tool included in Quarterly Project Reports and displayed on
   AFPACES that provides a current snapshot and four-quarter trend of Project performance
   across key financial, construction and operational metrics through utilization of color-coded
   rating levels (blue/exceptional, green/acceptable, yellow/marginal, red/unacceptable).
   5.6.4. Annual Insurance Report. Annual report for each project indicating the adequacy of
   current certificates of insurance, including comments and recommendations.
   5.6.5. Project Summary Report. Annual report for each project detailing the findings of
   annual site visits, including trends, comments and recommendations.

   any privatized home that exceed normal operations, M&R or replacement of an item within
   its expected service life, including work that primarily benefits a tenant and is not necessary
   for the safe utilization, functionality or habitability of the facility, as intended. EC&E
   excludes all routine O&M activities. EC&E reports for each installation are provided by the
   POs to the AF. These quarterly reports are forwarded to SAF/IEI for review.
   5.6.9. GOH Cost Reports. The FY09 National Defense Authorization Act requires the
   Services to annually report any GOH acquired or constructed and used or intended to be used
   as GOH and for which the total Operations, Maintenance ans Repair (OMR) costs for the unit
   exceeded $50,000. For more information on GOH reporting requirements, refer to AFI 32-
   6003.
5.7. Other Data Requirements.
   5.7.1. The project solicitation and transaction documents require the PO to collect, maintain
   and transmit HP financial and operations data, including the EC&E report, account data,
   insurance certificates and policies and tax receipts to the AF Portfolio Manager periodically,
   which are used to compile the required portfolio reports.
   5.7.2. AFCEE provides the PO information/reports to the installation, as needed, for
   compilation of data required for installation reports.

                                        Attachment 2
        METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING REIMBURSEMENT OF POLICE
       PROTECTION SERVICES FOR HOUSING PRIVATIZATION PROJECTS

A2.1. Authority. Title 10 U.S.C. §2872a authorizes the Government to furnish police
protection services, on a reimbursable basis, to any military housing acquired or constructed
pursuant to the exercise of any authority or combination of authorities under the Military
Housing Privatization Initiative (10 U.S.C. §§2871-2885, as amended) if the military housing is
located on a military installation.
A2.2. Calculation. The Government will calculate the amount of the annual reimbursement due
from the Lessee to the Government for such services delivered by the Government to the benefit
of the Base Project in accordance with Air Force policy and the following reimbursement
formula, as the same may be amended, supplemented or revised from time to time by the
Government.
   A2.2.1. Reimbursement for police protection services will be based on a single cost per unit
   and will be the same cost for all installations except as previously agreed upon in prior HP
   transactions. For example, the unit cost for the period 1 October 2012 through 30 September
   2013 (FY13) is $90 per unit per year, the same as FY12, and is subject to adjustment each
   fiscal year as detailed herein.
   A2.2.2. Prior to the Base Project Completion Date, the unit cost will be applied to the
   average number of units available for rental in any particular Government fiscal year,
   including units located on the Non-Debt-Sized Unit (NDSU) Parcels, which are described in
   the project transaction documents. Following the Base Project Completion Date, the average
   number of units on line (“U”) shall equal the sum of the minimum number of units required
   to be available for rental pursuant to Conditions 6.1 and 17.1 of the Lease, plus the average
   number of units available located on the NDSU Parcels for rental in any particular
   Government fiscal year. The unit count shall be reduced by the number of units that are not
   actually receiving police protection services from the Installation.
   A2.2.3. AFCEE/HP will determine the unit cost based on the Full Time Equivalent (FTE)
   rate billable to non-DoD entities for an Airman (E-3) based on the average number of units a
   Security Forces patrol will provide police protection services for in privatized housing
   projects. AFCEE/HP will work with AF/A7S and AF/A7CH to reestablish the baseline for
   the average number of units patrolled as required from time to time by the Government. FTE
   rate source is at the Web site at A5.14: DoD Military Personnel Composite Pay and
   Reimbursement rates to non-DoD entities.
   A2.2.4. AFCEE/HP will initiate an annual data call, including applicable guidance and Rate
   updates, in late July to ensure installations prepare timely updates and notify the PO of the
   updates in accordance with the Lease of Property. Under prior HP transactions, unless
   amended to incorporate the updated policy, SF units will be required to submit police
   response numbers. Under FY 11 and later transactions, installations must only identify the
   average number of on-line houses. These numbers will be combined with the five-year
   individual unit cost calculation provided by AF/A7S to determine total costs to each
   installation as identified in the formula below.
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                            75


   A2.2.5. These costs shall be reflected in the Project Operating Budget. The Project Owner
   (PO) will reimburse the Installation’s service agency for annual costs calculated for this level
   of service. The PO shall pay for police protection services furnished by the Government for
   the benefit of the Base Project. The Government will calculate the amount due annually and
   bill for reimbursement for such services in accordance with the applicable Exhibit to the
   Lease of Property.
   A2.2.6. Payments by the PO for police protection service reimbursements are required to be
   made to DFAS by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), or as otherwise agreed. Please refer to
   the latest Fire and Police Reimbursement for Housing Privatization Projects Fact Sheet for
   guidance on the process for billing and collecting reimbursements and the funding authorities
   required. Reimbursements must be credited back to the relevant appropriation supplying the
   service. Billings must identify the appropriate line(s) of accounting to ensure compliance
   with Title 10 U.S.C. §2872a.
   A2.2.7. The Police Protection Services Payment is Additional Rent, and shall be subject to
   adjustment effective each October 1 in accordance with the applicable Exhibit to the Lease of
   Property. On or before August 1st of each year, the Government will calculate the
   reimbursement amount based on a single per-unit cost, in accordance with the appropriate old
   or new methodology as described in the project transaction documents.
   A2.2.8. On or before September 1st of each year, the Government shall provide written
   notice to the PO of the amount of the Police Protection Services Payment for the fiscal year
   commencing October 1st of such year, which amount shall be payable in 12 monthly
   installments in accordance with the Lease of Property.
   A2.2.9. Billings must be prepared within 30 calendar days after the month in which services
   or performance occurred. The payment due date shall not be more than 30 calendar days
   from the date of the invoice. In accordance with the Lease of Property, if any installment of
   Rent is not paid within ten (10) business days after its due date, then such arrearage (i) shall
   bear a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of the amount due and be payable without
   demand simultaneously with the rent arrearage, and (ii) shall bear interest from the due date
   at the rate prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury for amounts past due to the Federal
   Government until paid in full.
   A2.2.10. For installations already privatized, the reimbursement formula will be based on
   the methodology included in the Transaction Documents. However, those projects will
   endeavor to negotiate with the PO to incorporate the revised police protection reimbursement
   calculation and formally amend the Lease of Property.
   A2.2.11. Calculations for Police Protection services will be updated annually in accordance
   with applicable Condition and/or Exhibit of the Lease of Property.
A2.3. Formula. For each installation, the following formula will be used to calculate the
reimbursement for police protection services: R= C x U.
   A2.3.1. R = Reimbursement
   A2.3.2. C = Annual estimated per-unit Cost for providing police protection services to the
   privatized housing project as determined by the Government. For FY12 and FY13, the cost
   is $90/unit/year.
 76                                            AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   A2.3.3. U = Average number of Units online. Prior to the HP project completion date, “U”
   shall equal the average number of units available for rent in any particular Government fiscal
   year, including units located on the NDSU Parcels, if applicable. Following the Base Project
   Completion Date, “U” shall equal the sum of the minimum number of units required to be
   available for rental pursuant to Conditions 6.1 and 17.1 of the Lease, plus the average
   number of homes located on the NDSU Parcels that are available for rental in any particular
   Government fiscal year, if applicable. “U” shall be reduced by the number of homes that are
   not actually receiving police protection services from the Installation.
A2.4. Example. For FY13, the unit cost (C) for police protection services is $90 per year. If an
installation has 550 privatized homes (U) on line that receive police protection services, then the
annual reimbursement (R) is calculated as follows: R = C X U = $90 x 550 homes = $49,500.
Therefore, based on this example, the estimated cost for providing police protection services to
the privatized housing project for the 12 month period from 1 Oct 2012 through 30 Sep 2013 is
$49,500, payable in arrears in equal monthly installments of $4,125.
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                           77


                                         Attachment 3
 METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING REIMBURSEMENT OF FIRE PROTECTION
         SERVICES FOR HOUSING PRIVATIZATION PROJECTS

A3.1. Authority. 10 U.S.C. §2872a authorizes the Government to furnish firefighting and fire
protection services, on a reimbursable basis, to any military housing acquired or constructed
pursuant to the exercise of any authority or combination of authorities under the Military
Housing Privatization Initiative (10 U.S.C. §§2871-2885, as amended) if the military housing is
located on a military installation.
A3.2. Calculation. The Government will calculate the amount of the annual reimbursement due
from the PO to the Government for such services delivered by the Government to the benefit of
the HP project in accordance with Air Force policy and the following reimbursement formulas,
as they may be amended, supplemented or revised from time to time by the Government.
   A3.2.1. The level of service will include response to fire emergencies to prevent loss of life
   and to minimize injury and damage to property and the environment. Response is defined as
   a response to a housing unit or structure within the privatized project to manage an
   emergency or probable emergency situation. Examples of emergency situations include
   reported fires, fire alarms, releases of hazardous material, rescue, injury, and medical or
   suspected medical emergencies. Generally, emergency responses prevent loss of life or
   property, prevent injury, relieve pain and suffering and protect the environment. Response
   includes resources managed by one or more firefighting crews.
   A3.2.2. The PO will reimburse the Installation’s service agency for annual costs calculated
   for emergency response based on per house/unit figure predicated on the five-year average
   number of responses the fire department will respond to within a privatized housing
   development. These costs will be reflected in the Project Operating Budget.
   A3.2.3. The validation of fire protection services takes place during the concept
   development stage of the HP project process and is incorporated into the RFP or RFQ.
   MAJCOM Fire Emergency and Services and the installation agency expected to provide the
   fire protection services for a privatized housing area shall review and approve the RFP or
   RFQ prior to final signature to ensure the appropriate agency is identified to provide fire and
   emergency services for the privatized housing area listed.
   A3.2.4. Reimbursement Calculations. The Government will calculate the fire reimbursement
   amount due annually and bill the PO for reimbursement for such services in accordance with
   the applicable Exhibit to the Lease of Property (“Fire and Police Services Payment”). Costs
   reflected in the formulas for each calculation are not intended to be exact or installation
   specific. They capture the average costs for the major expense to the AF in providing Fire
   and Emergency Service for privatized housing. Do not deviate. The following calculations
   are to be used as applicable:
       A3.2.4.1. Government Civilian Calculation. Used to calculate reimbursable costs when
       fire services are provided from a fire station maintained to protect government property
       in the area and services are provided by civilian firefighters. For Service Contract Act
       Firefighters, use actual contract rates.
          A3.2.4.1.1. The Government Civilian Calculation formula is R=N(C+P), where:
78                                          AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


            A3.2.4.1.1.1. R = Reimbursement.
            A3.2.4.1.1.2. N = Average number of annual responses to the privatized housing
            area as applicable over the past five Government fiscal years.
            A3.2.4.1.1.3. C = Estimated cost for FY12 to operate three response vehicles for
            one hour (Rescue, pumper, and command vehicles typically respond to each
            emergency response) per AFCESA guidance = $29.70.
            A3.2.4.1.1.4. P = One-hour wage of 8, GS-7 Step 5 firefighters (rest of US rate)
            with applicable fringe benefits (39% benefits for FY 12) = $205.28. Per
            AFCESA guidance, first response includes 8 personnel. For example, in 2011, a
            GS-7, Step 5 fire fighter earned $67,601.04, including overtime. The FY12 rate is
            a weighted average rate of the CY11 rate for 3 months and the CY11 rate inflated
            3% for 9 months. ($69,122.06 x 1.390 = $96,079.66 annually with a work
            schedule of 3,744 hours or $25.66/hour)).
        A3.2.4.1.2. Example for 22 fire responses. R = 22 x ($29.70+ $205.28) = 22 x
        $234.98 = $5,169.56. Therefore, based on this example, the estimated cost for
        providing fire protection to the privatized housing project as applicable for the 12-
        month period from 1 October 20XX through 30 September 20XX is $5,169.56,
        payable in arrears in 12 equal monthly installments of $430.80.
     A3.2.4.2. Military Calculation. Used to calculate reimbursable costs when fire services
     are provided from a fire station maintained to protect government property in the area and
     services are provided by military firefighters.
        A3.2.4.2.1. The Military Calculation formula is R=N(C+P), where:
            A3.2.4.2.1.1. R = Reimbursement.
            A3.2.4.2.1.2. N = Average number of annual responses to the privatized housing
            area as applicable over the past five Government fiscal years.
            A3.2.4.2.1.3. C = Estimated cost for FY12 to operate three response vehicles for
            one hour (Rescue, pumper, and command vehicles typically respond to each
            emergency response) = $29.70.
            A3.2.4.2.1.4. P = One-hour wage of 8 E-4 firefighters = $311.28 (Typical first
            response includes 8 personnel. In FY 2012, an E-4 fire fighter earns $38.91/hr x 8
            = $311.28.)
        A3.2.4.2.2. Example for 22 fire responses. R = 22 x ($29.70+ $311.28) = 22 x
        $340.98 = $7,501.56. Therefore, in this example, the estimated cost for providing fire
        protection to the privatized housing project as applicable for the 12-month period
        from 1 October 20XX through 30 September 20XX is $7,501.56, payable in arrears in
        12 equal monthly installments of $625.13.
     A3.2.4.3. Government Civilian and Military Calculation. Used when the fire station
     serving HP is manned with both military and civilian firefighters (regardless of actual
     percentage), calculate the personnel cost based on four civilian firefighters and four
     military firefighters. The reimbursable amount is based on “per call” average cost.
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                        79


        A3.2.4.3.1. The Government Civilian and Military Calculation formula is
        R=N(C+P), where:
            A3.2.4.3.1.1. R = Reimbursement.
            A3.2.4.3.1.2. N = Average Number of annual responses to the privatized housing
            area as applicable over the past five Government fiscal years.
            A3.2.4.3.1.3. C = Estimated Cost for FY 12 to operate three response vehicles for
            one hour (Rescue, pumper, and command vehicles typically respond to each
            emergency response) = $29.70.
            A3.2.4.3.1.4. P = The Personnel cost civilian firefighter hourly rate plus the
            military firefighter hourly rate = $258.28. (The civilian firefighter hourly rate
            from A3.2.4.1.1.3 above = $25.66/hour x 4 = $102.64. The military firefighter
            hourly rate from 3.2.4.2.1.4 above = $38.91/hr x 4 = $155.64. P=$102.64 +
            $155.64 = $258.28)
        A3.2.4.3.2. Example for 22 fire responses. R = N(C+P) = 22 x ($29.70+ $258.28) =
        22 x $287.98 = $6,335.56. Therefore, in this example, the estimated cost for
        providing fire protection to the privatized housing project, as applicable, for the 12-
        month period from 1 October 20XX through 30 September 20XX is $6,335.56
        payable in arrears in 12 equal monthly installments of $527.96.
     A3.2.4.4. Solely for HP use. Used to calculate reimbursable costs when fire services are
     provided from a fire station maintained to protect privatized homes but would not
     otherwise be required to protect government property. The Fire Chief uses Technical
     Implement Guide 1710 to determine if government facilities in the area justify a
     government fire station. Government facilities considered remote and outlying justify
     increases to response time standards. With the increased response time allowed, fire
     protection services could be provided from another fire station. In these cases, if a fire
     station is maintained, it would be reimbursed according to this formula.
        A3.2.4.4.1. Exception. Projects that have already closed may be exempt from this
        formula based on the project’s legal transaction (closing) documents and may
        continue to use the other three calculations in A3.2.4.1, A3.2.4.2 or A3.2.4.3, as
        applicable. Any deviation request must be coordinated through the MAJCOM,
        AFCEE, AFCESA and A7C for approval.
        A3.2.4.4.2. The Solely-for-HP-Use formula is R = P + V + M, where:
            A3.2.4.4.2.1. R = Reimbursement
            A3.2.4.4.2.2. P = Personnel cost = $768,637.28, based on the annual salary of
            eight GS-7, Step 5 firefighters at the Rest-of-US rate including applicable fringe
            benefits (39% benefits for FY12)). A typical first response includes eight
            personnel. In CY 2011, a GS-7, Step 5 firefighter earned $67,601.04 annually.
            The FY 2012 salary is the weighted average salary of the CY11 rate for 3 months,
            plus the CY11 salary, inflated 3%, for the remaining 9 months. The weighted
            average FY2012 salary is $69,122.06. After including the fringe benefits (39%),
            the weighted average salary increases to $96,079.66. For 8 personnel, the total
            personnel cost (P) equals $96,079.66 x 8 or $768,637.28.
80                                            AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


             A3.2.4.4.2.3. V = Vehicle cost = $41,715 (Annual amortization cost for three
             typical first response vehicles using straight line depreciation over 20 years)
             A3.2.4.4.2.4. M = Maintenance Cost = $10,300 (the average cost for maintenance
             of the fire station facility, vehicles, and equipment and supplies.)
         A3.2.4.4.3. Example for 22 responses. R = P + V+ M = $768,637.28 + $41,715 +
         $10,300 = $820,652.28. Therefore, in the example, the estimated cost for providing
         fire protection solely to the privatized housing project as applicable for the 12-month
         period from 1 October 20XX through 30 September 20XX is $820,652.28, payable in
         arrears in 12 equal monthly installments of $68,387.69.
  A3.2.5. Annual Data Call. AFCEE/HP will initiate an annual data call, including
  applicable guidance, in late July to ensure installations prepare timely updates and notify the
  PO of the updates in accordance with the Lease of Property. In response to the data call, the
  installation will provide AFCEE/HP the number of responses with supporting call summaries
  and average number of units.
     A3.2.5.1. Historical responses shall be tracked with sufficient detail to determine type of
     response. If no historical responses are available, AFCEE/HP will provide the average
     number of responses based on portfolio experience for comparable sized projects.
     A3.2.5.2. Fire and Emergency Service call summaries, excluding Privacy Act sensitive
     information, will be made available to AFCEE/HP upon submission of each annual
     update. AFCEE/HP will provide the call summaries to the PO upon request.
     A3.2.5.3. AFCEE/HP, in coordination with AFCESA, will update personnel and vehicle
     amounts annually. Installations will be required to provide number of responses with
     supporting Summary of Responses and average number of units. The following resources
     will be used to update the amounts:
         A3.2.5.3.1. USAF Raw Inflation Indices (AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and
         Planning Factors).
         A3.2.5.3.2. DoD Military Composite Pay and Reimbursement rates and civilian
         personnel fringe benefit billing rates to non-DoD entities are available on the Web
         site in Attachment 5.
         A3.2.5.3.3. Civilian Personnel rates are based on the weighted average rate based on
         three months of the current Calendar Year (CY) rate and nine months of the current
         CY rate, inflated 3% (average inflation rate for HP projects) to convert the rate to a
         Fiscal Year (FY) basis.
  A3.2.6. Response Time Deviations. In the case of an approved AF deviation from response
  times, as outlined in DoDI 6055.06, DoD Fire and Emergency Services (F&ES) Program, if
  the PO, local civil authority, or local/state regulations prevent the deficient level of services
  from being provided to privatized housing, the PO is responsible to correct the deficiency
  unless otherwise agreed to in the transaction closing documents. Correction may include
  constructing a fire station, funding additional firefighters, arranging fire protection from
  other sources, etc.
  A3.2.7. Payments. PO payments for fire reimbursements are required to be made to DFAS
  by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or as otherwise agreed. Please refer to the latest Fire and
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                        81


  Police Reimbursement for Housing Privatization Projects Fact Sheet for guidance on the
  process for billing and collecting reimbursements and the funding authorities required for
  reimbursements. Reimbursements must be credited back to the relevant appropriation
  supplying the service. Billings must identify the appropriate line(s) of accounting to ensure
  compliance with 10 U.S.C. §2872a.
     A3.2.7.1. The Fire Services payment is “Additional Rent” and shall be subject to
     adjustment effective each October 1st in accordance with the applicable Exhibit to the
     Lease of Property.
     A3.2.7.2. On or before September 1st of each year, the Air Force shall provide written
     notice to the PO of the amount of the Fire Services Payment for the fiscal year
     commencing October 1st, which shall be payable in twelve monthly installments in
     accordance with the Lease of Property.
     A3.2.7.3. Billings must be prepared within 30 calendar days after the month in which
     services or performance occurred. The payment due date shall not be more than 30
     calendar days from the date of the invoice. In accordance with the Lease of Property, if
     any installment of Rent is not paid within 10 business days after its due date, then such
     arrearage shall bear a late charge equal to five percent of the amount due and be payable
     without demand simultaneously with the rent arrearage, and shall bear interest from the
     due date at the rate prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury for amounts past due to
     the Federal government until paid in full.

       FACT SHEET – FIRE AND POLICE REIMBURSEMENTS FOR HOUSING
                         PRIVATIZATION PROJECTS

A4.1. Purpose. The purpose of this fact sheet is to provide general guidance on appropriation
reimbursements and the process for billing and collecting reimbursements of fire protection
services and police protection services provided by the Government to housing privatization
projects, as applicable.
A4.2. Background. Privatization Project Owners (PO) receiving fire protection and police
protection services from the Installation reimburse the organizations providing these services in
accordance with the HP project transaction documents. The initial annual reimbursable amount
due and billed for fire protection services and police protection services is calculated in
accordance with the applicable Exhibit to the Lease of Property (“Fire and Police Services
Payment”) and provided in the transaction documents. The PO pays reimbursements by
Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or as otherwise agreed.
A4.3. Reimbursement Program Management. Reimbursement programs must be closely
monitored to ensure good fiscal responsibility. The AF organization supplying or performing the
supplies and services is responsible for billing and collecting reimbursements for those services.
   A4.3.1. Responsibilities. The Base Civil Engineer and Installation Defense Force
   Commander (DFC) are the primary points of contact for fire and police protection services,
   respectively. These duties may be delegated to the Installation Capital Asset Manager as
   focal point and liaison for the Air Force and PO regarding housing privatization.
       A4.3.1.1. The BCE provides annual response data in accordance with reimbursement
       methodology with supporting documentation and source references to the CE Resource
       Advisor (RA) to compute annual updates for reimbursable costs for fire protection
       services.
       A4.3.1.2. The DFC provides annual response data in accordance with reimbursement
       methodology with supporting documentation and source references to the Security Forces
       RA to compute annual updates for reimbursable costs for security services.
       A4.3.1.3. Installation Capital Asset Managers, as delegated by the BCE and DFC,
       provide process oversight to ensure the reimbursement billing and collection process is
       implemented at the installation in accordance with the HP project transaction documents.
       This includes ensuring bills are prepared monthly by applicable Civil Engineer and
       Security Forces RAs and updated annually with information provided by the organization
       providing the services. Capital Asset Managers coordinate with appropriate BCE and SF
       organizational points of contact and the Property Management Office to ensure processes
       are established, billings are prepared and costs are updated annually as required in project
       transaction documents and submitted to AFCEE/HP for approval.
       A4.3.1.4. Resource Advisors (RA), located at the organization supplying or performing
       the service, prepare the appropriate billing documents using the annual agreed-upon
       reimbursement provided by the BCE and DFC.
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                          83


       A4.3.1.5. The Accounting Liaison Office (ALO) assists the RAs, processes information
       received from the RAs and sends the information to DFAS. The ALO provides reach-
       back for verification of PO billings to DFAS and receipt/allocation of payments back to
       appropriate line of accounting.
       A4.3.1.6. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) regional field site office
       processes billings and submits to PO for payment.
       A4.3.1.7. The Project Owner (PO) pays reimbursements electronically in accordance
       with billing terms.
       A4.3.1.8. Strong communication between all the participants: BCE, DFC, Civil Engineer
       and Security Forces Resource Advisors (RAs), Accounting Liaison Office (ALO),
       regional DFAS personnel, PO, and the installation Capital Asset Manager are essential to
       the process.
A4.4. Annual Reimbursement Update Overview. Annual reimbursement updates are
calculated by the applicable RAs using updated response data, less any Privacy Act sensitive
information, and the AFCEE/HP-provided fire and police reimbursement template spreadsheets.
Updated calculations along with supporting backup documentation are submitted to the
installation Capital Asset Manager for review and coordination through AFCEE/HP for approval,
with copy to the BCE or DFC, as applicable. Once approved, the annual update is coordinated
through the PO by the installation Capital Asset Manager for incorporation into the annual
project budget. After approval and coordination with the PO, the installation Capital Asset
Manager notifies the BCE and DFC to inform RAs to prepare and submit billing documents to
the Installation ALO. The ALO validates and certifies the billing documents and submits them
to the servicing regional DFAS field site for processing. All reimbursements must be processed
through the Installation ALO, as the liaison between installation and DFAS.
A4.5. Reimbursable Orders. Authorities to incur obligation (Reimbursable Order) are the
legislative authority in 10 U.S.C. §2872a and the written agreements between the Air Force and
the PO (Lease of Property (LOP) and the other transaction documents).
   A4.5.1. Processing Receivables from the Public. The provision of utilities and services on a
   reimbursable basis in connection with housing privatization projects is expressly authorized
   under 10 U.S.C. §2872a. OSD(C) financial reporting guidance prohibits installations from
   treating these accounts receivable as budgetary authority; i.e., an AF Form 406,
   Miscellaneous Obligation/Reimbursement Documents (MORD), is not allowed.
   A4.5.2. Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funds expended to provide required services to
   Project Owners (PO) may not be obligated for AF purposes until compensation is received by
   the Air Force. Any funds received after the period of availability (fiscal year), would be
   effectively lost to the installation. However, the FY12 National Defense Authorization Act
   (NDAA) amended 42 U.S.C. §1856d, paragraph b, to allow for the collection of prior year
   payment, for fire protection reimbursements only, into the appropriation or fund that is
   currently available to the activity for the same purpose. This amendment only applies to
   reimbursements for expenditures of funds after the date of the enactment of the 2012 NDAA;
   it does not apply to FY11 funds. Installations may send advance billing requests as directed
   by SAF/FMP; however, the installation is still responsible to send monthly bills in arrears in
   accordance with HP transaction documents.
 84                                            AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


       A4.5.2.1. Include all required information (Accounting Classification, Date prepared,
       Document Number, etc.).
       A4.5.2.2. Use Responsibility Center/Cost Center (RC/CC) of the organization(s)
       providing the service and/or materials and the appropriate Element of Expense (EEIC) for
       the type of services or materials provided such as civilian pay, supplies, fuels, etc.
   A4.5.3. Reimbursements received from services provided and materials sold that are
   included in the installations O&M (3400) appropriations and budgeted for in the annual
   Financial Plan are collected back to the O&M (3400) appropriation and usually into RC/CC
   of organization providing the service and/or materials. Reimbursements received from labor
   provided by military personnel to non-DoD, federal and non-federal customers are collected
   into the Military Personnel (MILPERS) appropriation (3500), centralized and managed at the
   Treasury, not at the Installation. The Installation ALO or servicing Regional DFAS field site
   office can provide the appropriate line of accounting for processing MILPERS collections.
A4.6. Billing and Collecting Reimbursements. Billings must be prepared within 30 calendar
days after the month in which services or performance occurred. The payment due date shall not
be more than 30 calendar days from the date of the invoice. In accordance with the Lease of
Property, if any installment of Rent is not paid within ten (10) business days after its due date,
then such arrearage shall bear a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of the amount due and be
payable without demand simultaneously with the rent arrearage, and shall bear interest from the
due date at the rate prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury for amounts past due to the
Federal Government until paid in full.
   A4.6.1. Remittance Express (REX) is a program used by DFAS-IN to receive collections
   through Ca$hLink. The PO (vendor) must sign up for REX service with their bank.
   A4.6.2. The American Banking Association (ABA) Routing Number (Wiring Account
   Number) for DFAS-IN (Institution receiving the REX) is 051036706. All AF privatized
   projects use this number.
   A4.6.3. Each DFAS Field site (entity receiving the REX) has an Account/Identification
   Number. The ALO or servicing regional DFAS Field site office can provide the appropriate
   account number. For example, the DFAS Limestone (6671) account number is 312030, the
   DFAS Columbus (5030) account number is 312039 and the DFAS Japan (6688) account
   number is 312032.
   A4.6.4. RAs prepare the appropriate billing documents using the annual agreed upon
   reimbursement provided by the BCE and DFC. Billing documents are submitted to the
   installation ALO, who will submit the documents to the regional DFAS field site office for
   processing and provide a copy to the installation Capital Asset Manager.
   A4.6.5. Standard Form (SF) 1080 (Voucher for Transfer Between Appropriations), DD
   Form 1131 (Cash Collection Voucher) or an approved installation standard billing form can
   be used.
       A4.6.5.1. Bills in arrears are prepared monthly. Installation may prepare advanced
       billing requests to save their own direct budget authority; however, the PO is not required
       to pay in advance of services.
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                          85


       A4.6.5.2. Include the appropriate Accounting Data Elements (appropriation and element
       of expense investment code (EEIC)) receiving the collection. Reimbursements are
       collected back into the appropriation account providing the service or materials.
       A4.6.5.3. The following information should be included on the invoice: description of
       services received (purpose of reimbursement); installation name and a point of contact;
       payment “Remit to” address; Account/Identification Number of DFAS Field site office
       receiving the REX; and, name and address of customer charged (i.e. Property
       Management Office)
       A4.6.5.4. Management of reimbursement programs may vary by installation. For
       assistance in tailoring these procedures for your installation contact AFCEE Housing
       Operations (AFCEE/HPO) and AFCEE Portfolio Management (AFCEE/HPM).

     STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: FIRE EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEM
      PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR PRIVATIZED FAMILY HOUSING

A6.1. Introduction: Fire protection is an essential service for safeguarding residents and
property in privatized military family housing. Since water is the principal enabler for
firefighting and rescue operations, accomplishment of proper repair, maintenance, inspection and
testing of water distribution systems, including fire hydrants, are crucial. This Standard
Operating Procedure (SOP) focuses on fire equipment and system protection services supporting
the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI). Preventive maintenance support including
the preservation of water distribution systems and certification of fire flow testing are major
components addressed in this document. The procedure developed is aimed at ensuring
validation of fire protection requirements by the responsible party at the installation level.
    A6.1.1. The responsible party charged with repair, maintenance, inspection, and testing may
    be a public or private entity. Depending on how the transaction agreement was crafted, and
    more importantly, the legal closing documents governing the real estate transaction, there
    may be multiple stakeholders involved with validating fire protection requirements. With
    that said, the first issue that should be addressed is, “Who owns the water utility
    infrastructure and fire protection system/equipment supporting privatized housing?”
A6.2. Ownership of Utilities and Fire Protection equipment. The responsibility for
accomplishing fire hydrant maintenance and inspection, along with certifying the fire flow test in
the water distribution system, falls upon the owner of the infrastructure and system/equipment.
In housing privatization, the owner is also the party assigned to operate and maintain the utility
system. There are four possibilities of “ownership” that may apply, as shown in Figure A6-1.

Figure A6.1. Types of Ownership of Utilities and Fire Protection Equipment.

1    The water distribution system and fire hydrants are conveyed to the MHPI PO.

2    The Government retains ownership and maintains the water distribution system and
     hydrants located within the boundaries of privatized housing, and the PO reimburses the
     Government for preventive maintenance support.

3    The water distribution system and fire hydrants are conveyed to the PO and the PO re-
     conveys to the local utility company, or the local utility company acquires the water
     distribution infrastructure.

4    Utilities Privatization Contractor (UPC) is the owner of the fire hydrants and/or water
     distribution system within the Metes & Bounds (M&B) parcels/grounds of privatized
     housing.

    A6.2.1. Water distribution system conveyed to the Privatized Housing Project
    Owner. In many cases the water utility distribution system residing inside the boundaries of
    the leased land, including the fire hydrants, are conveyed to the PO. Under this
    circumstance, the Ground Lease agreement generally states that the PO is responsible for the
    repair, operation, and maintenance of the utility system it owns, and must comply with all
88                                           AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


  applicable local, county, state and federal laws, rules and regulations. Consequently in this
  situation, all required repair, maintenance and inspection of the fire hydrant network and
  flow test of the water distribution system is accomplished by the PO and, therefore, the PO is
  visibly the responsible party. The PO should work in close coordination with the Base Civil
  Engineer (Base Fire Marshall) and Base Fire Department in completing this effort and
  ensuring the appropriate documentation is provided to the Fire Chief.
  A6.2.2. Government-owned water distribution system residing within the leased
  premise of housing privatization. There are housing privatization projects in the Air Force
  portfolio where the Government retained ownership of the fire hydrants and portions of the
  water distribution system within the M&B parcel boundaries of the leased land. In doing so,
  the Government becomes the proprietor of the fire emergency system network and is charged
  with undertaking repair, maintenance, inspection, and testing of the fire protection
  components. Typically, the Base Civil Engineer Operations Flight Chief is responsible to the
  AF Fire Marshal (Base Civil Engineer, CE Group or Squadron Commander) for inspection,
  testing, maintenance and documentation associated with the water distribution system
  supporting fire protection services. Under this scenario, the process by which this is carried
  out should be no different than what had previously been fulfilled prior to execution of the
  housing privatization initiative. Demarcation points should be clearly identified to
  distinguish the Government’s responsibilities from that of the PO. Upon completion of
  maintenance, inspection and testing, the Base Civil Engineer should submit the appropriate
  documentation for validation by the AF Fire Chief. The PO will reimburse for preventive
  maintenance support services through the O&M component of the rate charged for water
  identified in the Utilities Service Agreement.
  A6.2.3. Locally owned utilities residing in privatized housing. At those projects where
  the Air Force conveyed the water distribution system to the PO, the PO has the right to
  convey the system to local utility companies. Where such a conveyance has occurred, the
  local utility company owns, operates, repairs, and maintains the water distribution system to
  include the fire hydrant network inside the M&B parcels/grounds of privatized housing.
  With an agreement in place, the local utility provider may be held accountable for fire
  hydrant repair, maintenance and water distribution system flow testing, while the Base Civil
  Engineer (Base Fire Marshall) and the MHPI Project Owner remain focal points for
  validating performance. If the installation provides fire protection services, then the local
  utility provider will coordinate work with the AF Fire Chief to accomplish repair,
  maintenance, inspection, and testing. If fire protection is provided by the local jurisdiction
  and not by the base, then the local utility provider will comply and coordinate their efforts
  with the State Fire Marshal, promulgated Fire Prevention Regulations and related adopted
  Codes and Standards and any other State, County, or local incorporation fire prevention
  and/or regulatory codes and standards that have been adopted, directed, or required within
  the M&B parcels/grounds of the privatized housing project.
  A6.2.4. Utilities Privatization Contractor (UPC) owns, operates and maintains the
  water distribution system. Fire hydrant repair, maintenance and water flow testing in this
  situation would be accomplished by the UPC. Similar to the circumstance under the
  Government provided utilities, the PO would not be responsible for accomplishing this task.
  The agreement between the installation and the UPC dictates what level of O&M must be
  accomplished. Each UP contract is adapted to correspond with the requirement of the
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                              89


   installation. Some select UP transactions may have assigned responsibility for the water
   distribution system to the UPC, while the Government retained responsibility for the fire
   hydrants. This condition will require close coordination in validating performance of fire
   hydrant repair, maintenance/inspection and water flow testing.
A6.3. Validating privatized housing fire protection requirements at the
installation. Validating fire protection requirements for privatized military family housing is a
collaborative effort among all involved participants. The AF Fire Chief and the owner of the fire
hydrants and the water utility distribution system play a major role in certifying the fulfillment of
fire protection requirements. The following guidance is offered to assist the installation in
providing timely validation of repair, maintenance, inspection, and testing of the exterior fire
protection system supporting housing privatization. Key to this effort is the Base Civil
Engineer’s (BCE) role as the Base Fire Marshall and the Government’s focal point.
   A6.3.1. Role of the Base Civil Engineer (BCE). The installation-level Asset Manager is a
   partner with the PO. As the Government’s focal point and Base Fire Marshall, the B can
   channel requests to the appropriate agency, coordinate actions among a diversified group of
   participants, and provide base operation assistance as needed. To support the validation of
   fire protection requirements, the Asset Manager should perform the following:
       A6.3.1.1. Determine the responsible party for accomplishing fire hydrant repair,
       maintenance and fire flow test on the water distribution system within the premises of
       privatized housing.
       A6.3.1.2. Coordinate with the AF Fire Chief and obtain the specific installation criteria
       and timetable required for periodic fire hydrant maintenance, inspection, and water flow
       testing, and provide the requirement to the appropriate party responsible for completing
       the task.
       A6.3.1.3. Ensure the responsible party performing fire protection repair, maintenance,
       inspection and testing, coordinate with the Fire Chief and the PO prior to commencing
       the work.
       A6.3.1.4. Make certain the AF Fire Chief monitors the work taking place.
       A6.3.1.5. Track completion and ensure the appropriate documents validating the
       accomplishment of fire hydrant repair, maintenance/inspection and certification of water
       distribution system fire flow test are prepared. Documents should validate the fire
       emergency system and appurtenances are operating properly, or describe deficiencies that
       need to be resolved.
       A6.3.1.6. Submit the appropriate documents (certifications, inspection reports,
       maintenance data, water distribution tests, etc.) to the AF Fire Chief for review/approval.
       A6.3.1.7. If deficiencies are noted, track completion and re-submit results to the Fire
       Chief.
       A6.3.1.8. Record the AF Fire Chief’s receipt and approval of documents as confirmation
       of compliance.
   A6.3.2. Role of the Base Fire Department. If the Base Fire Department is the fire
   emergency service provider for MHPI, they must be involved in the process of validating fire
   protection requirements. As the responder to emergency events, firefighters must know the
 90                                            AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   status of water distribution systems and be aware of any deficiencies. Accordingly, the AF
   Fire Chief reviews the results of the water flow test and maintenance/inspections conducted
   on fire hydrants. The following guidelines are provided to assist the AF Fire Chief in this
   joint effort and ensure they receive confirmation of the results.
      A6.3.2.1. Work in close coordination with the Base Civil Engineer (Base Fire Marshall)
      and provide the necessary information for accomplishing preventive maintenance and
      inspection on fire hydrants and water flow testing on the emergency system supporting
      privatized housing.
      A6.3.2.2. Establish the schedule of events required for recurring maintenance and
      inspection of the fire hydrants and the timetable for accomplishing fire flow testing.
      A6.3.2.3. Prompt the “Utility System/Equipment Owner” of scheduled maintenance,
      inspection, and testing well in advance of the established due date.
      A6.3.2.4. Spot check the work in progress during the fire flow testing of the water
      distribution system.
      A6.3.2.5. Provide guidance on the set up of fire flow testing such as identifying the
      pressure and flow hydrants and determining the area to be tested.
      A6.3.2.6. Validate the completion of maintenance, inspection and testing on the fire
      emergency system and submit confirmation of compliance to the Base Asset Manager.
      A6.3.2.7. If discrepancies exist, track completion of the work that needs to be corrected
      and request a re-test when appropriate.
      A6.3.2.8. Review plans to ensure all required features are present and local emergency
      response elements are incorporated (i.e., accessibility to facility, location of fire hydrants,
      etc.).
      A6.3.2.9. Provide technical consultation and assistance as necessary to the Base Asset
      Manager and the responsible party accomplishing the validation of fire protection
      requirements.
A6.4. Functions of the Forward Operating Agencies.
   A6.4.1. Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE). AFCEE in
   its role as the execution agent, portfolio manager and administrator for housing privatization
   is involved in the real estate transaction, operations, management, and compliance of the Air
   Force Housing Privatization program. In validating fire protection requirements, AFCEE
   must remain engaged from pre-closing, post-closing, and throughout the life of the
   lease/project. The following is a brief summary describing responsibilities as they relate to
   supporting the installation in this endeavor.
      A6.4.1.1. Housing Privatization Execution (AFCEE/HPE). Incorporate fire protection
      services and preventive maintenance support to include fire flow testing of the water
      distribution system, and recurring repair, maintenance and inspections on fire hydrants in
      all MHPI real estate transactions currently in the solicitation phase. Ensure the
      involvement of the Fire Chief during concept development and preparations of the RFP
      or /RFQ document. The housing privatization closing transaction documents, “Exhibit
      Building Codes and Standards,” provides the umbrella jurisdictionally-adopted State Fire
AFI32-6007_VANCEAFBSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                        91


       Marshal fire protection and fire safety codes and standards, for each state where an Air
       Force installation has a privatized housing project.
       A6.4.1.2. Housing Privatization Portfolio Management (AFCEE/HPM). Assess the
       effectiveness of the process in which the base and PO validate fire protection
       requirements. Utilize the Compliance Testing process to monitor completion of
       preventive maintenance on the fire equipment and the utility infrastructure conveyed to
       the PO. Projects that do not accomplish specific fire protection repair, maintenance,
       inspection and testing based on the current transaction agreement will be amended, if
       possible, to incorporate the requirement in the legal documents.
       A6.4.1.3. Housing Privatization Operations Management (AFCEE/HPO). Provide
       support to the Base Housing Management Office in establishing a program for validating
       fire protection requirements. Develop and provide training to ensure the Base Asset
       Management staff understands their roles and responsibilities in complying with the
       requirement. Expand the Compliance Testing checklist to address fire protection
       preventive maintenance as outlined in each project’s Facilities Maintenance Plan.
       A6.4.1.4. Housing Privatization Compliance (AFCEE/HPC). Confirm the installation’s
       compliance with regards to the validation of fire protection requirements. Incorporate
       into the Housing Management Office Assessment checklist, the validation of the
       installation’s responsibility to accomplish fire hydrant maintenance, and water
       distribution system flow test supporting MHPI projects.
   A6.4.2. Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA). The Air Force Fire Chief
   and Fire Emergency Services Branch (CEXF) Chief within the Readiness Support Division
   (CEX) facilitates AF fire protection by providing program management and functional
   oversight for the AF Fire Emergency Services program. Accordingly, the Air Force Fire
   Chief will incorporate policies supporting this SOP in AFI 32-2001, Fire Emergency
   Services Program, and provide specific guidance as necessary to support operational
   objectives (firefighting and rescue) while ensuring firefighter safety.

   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ): UTILITY ALLOWANCE (UA) FOR
                           RESIDENTS

A7.1. Background. In accordance with a DoD and Air Force policy, all privatized housing
residents will be individually responsible for paying for their gas and electricity consumption.
BAH includes amounts to pay for your rent, utilities, and personal property insurance. Prior to
housing privatization and until meters are/were installed on the houses in your community,
tenants paid all of their BAH for housing and were not billed for utility consumption. The Utility
Allowance (UA) program breaks out the utilities portion from BAH and provides an incentive
for the tenant to conserve energy and save money.
A7.2. How is the UA calculated? The local Property Manager calculates the UA and the Air
Force verifies and approves that allowance annually. The calculation is the average consumption
of gas and electricity of the unit type, multiplied by the applicable utility rate – including fees
and taxes (kilowatt hours for electricity and cubic feet for gas) – plus a ten percent cushion. The
ten percent cushion helps protect the tenant from variations in natural gas and electric rates and
seasonal deviations from the average. Every unit type receives a different UA. Only similar
homes are grouped together (new 3-bedroom homes are NOT grouped with older or renovated 3-
bedroom homes, one-story homes are NOT grouped with two-story homes, etc.). Only occupied
units are included in the calculation (periods of vacancy are not included in the average
calculation for any unit type). The UA calculation is based on up to the trailing five years of
actual consumption data, but no less than 12 months of data.
A7.3. How does a tenant pay for utilities? After the UA program is implemented, each tenant
will be responsible for paying their utility bill each month from their BAH. As a result of the
UA, each tenant’s allotment for housing is less than their BAH. The difference – which they will
keep to pay for utilities - is the UA. On the monthly bill, tenants will be able to compare their
gas and electricity usage to the average usage on which their UA is based. If the tenants
consume less utilities than the average amount, they will pocket the savings when their actual
usage is reconciled with the average usage used to calculate the UA. If they consume more than
the average amount, they will have to pay out of pocket for the difference. Oftentimes, the utility
provider or Property Manager will provide tips on how tenants can reduce their monthly
consumption. Depending on the utility distribution method at each base, tenants may receive
their utility bill from a local utility provider or from the Property Manager. In either case, the
Property Manager does not profit from this program. At most bases, tenants will receive one bill
for natural gas usage and another bill for electricity usage.
A7.4. How does a tenant get more information about the UA? If a tenant has questions
about the UA for their home, such as how it was calculated, the billing process, or when a UA
will be implemented at your base, they should contact the local Property Management Office.

32-6007 VAFB Sup 1, paragraphs 4.17.2 through 4.17.2.1.9. I further understand and agree to
the following conditions regarding my hiring a live-in childcare provider (nanny) in Vance
Privatized Housing (PH):

   a. As the sponsor, I will be responsible for the live-in childcare provider (nanny) and his/her
actions while on Vance AFB.

   b. I will be considered an employer and must follow all federal, state and local laws
concerning domestic employment.

    c. I will incur personal liability for an employee who works/resides in my household. I am
liable for loss or damage resulting from said employment; therefore, I agree to obtain personal
liability insurance, which will apply to personal injury to the nanny and damages to the property
and provide for the cost of medical treatment incident to the worst case of injury.

   d. I will provide a copy of the insurance policy to Hunt within 15 days of receipt of approval
to hire.

   e. The US and Hunt will be identified as additional insureds against any and all damage, loss
or destruction of the residence, contents or business and liability incident to my hiring a live-in
childcare provider (nanny), and that any termination of the insurance shall first require 30-days'
notice to the US.

   f. The nanny is not a full-time active duty military member and is not employed full-time at
any other vocation.

   g. The nanny is 18 years old or older and a legal citizen of the US.

   h. I shall ensure the nanny is knowledgeable of and abides by VAFBI 34-249, Youth
Supervision Guidelines.

   i. The US can suspend or terminate the authorization permitting the nanny access to the base.

   j. I understand approval of a live-in childcare provider does not imply entitlement to benefits
or privileges to which non-family members are not otherwise entitled, nor does approval
represent a family housing bedroom requirement.

  k. I will immediately notify Hunt if at any time the nanny leaves my employment. I will
complete a new request if hiring a different nanny.

   l. The individual I intend to hire as a nanny is
