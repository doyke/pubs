2. General Property Management Responsibilities:

2.1. The Air Forceâ€™s mission makes it imperative that all personnel operate and maintain government

individual. Property management responsibilities limit the use of government property to official
purposes only.

government systems, equipment, supplies and real property for operational requirements. Subordinate
commanders are responsible to their commanders for prudent management, control, storage and cost-
effective use of government property under their jurisdiction. Government property includes, but is
not limited to, hand tools, operating stocks, individual equipment, organizational and operational
administrative equipment and supplies.

2.4. Property management responsibility includes financial liability for the loss, damage, or
destruction of property resulting from negligence, willful misconduct or deliberate unauthorized use.

Defense directives establish the following property accountability echelons:

3.2.2. Responsible Officer. An individual appointed by proper authority to exercise custody, care and
safekeeping over property entrusted to his or her possession or under his or her supervision
(branch/section chiefs).
