                      CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN
PART I
PREFACE
1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that
identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task
requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor
in all aspects of career field training. NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support
duty position qualification training.
2. The CFETP consists of two parts; supervisors plan, manage, and control training within the specialty using both
parts of the plan.
2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains how
everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities,
training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge,
education, experience, training, and other); and Section D indicates resource constraints. Some examples are funds,
manpower, equipment, and facilities; Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SrA through
MSgt.
2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A: identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties,
tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training,
wartime course and core task and correspondence course requirements. Section B: contains the course objective list
and training standards which supervisors will use to determine if airmen have satisfied training requirements.
Section C: identifies available support materials. An example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP), which
may be developed to support proficiency training. Section D: identifies a training course index supervisors can use
to determine resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses. Section
E: identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required
for the associated qualification needs. At unit level, supervisors, trainers, Command Language Program Managers
(CLPMs), Language Mentors, and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct
training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.
3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient
training at the appropriate points in their careers. This plan will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's
jobs.
4. Air Force members are encouraged to query available training opportunities by utilizing the Air Education and
Training Command (AETC) Education and Training Course Announcement website at:

Section A - General Information
1. Purpose. This CFETP provides the information necessary for AFCFM, MFM, commanders, training managers,
supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training
program. This plan outlines the training that individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress
throughout their career. This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training.
Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon
retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of
the technical training centers. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements,
and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-skill level. Qualification training
is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position. This training
program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the performance skills
and knowledge required to do the job. Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected airmen.
Proficiency training is additional training; in-residence, exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training
provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The
CFETP also serves the following purposes:
1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program. Also, it is
used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual’s career.
1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends
education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.
1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method.
1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training process.
2. Use of CFETP. The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and
cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.
2.1. AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training
based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP. They will also work
with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.
2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency
requirements. OJT, resident training, and contract training or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements.
MAJCOM-developed training used to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into the plan.
2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The list of courses in
Part II will be used as a reference to support training.
2.4. Personnel in AFSC 1AX career fields are exempt from maintaining OJT Training Folders (AF Form 623
Individual Training Record Folder). All training not documented in Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) will be
documented in each Airman’s six-part folder as follows:
         Part 1:   CFETP/STS
         Part 2:   Certifications
         Part 3:   ISR Mission skills training
         Part 4:   ISR Mission skills certifications
         Part 5:   Waivers
         Part 6:   Narrative Remarks
All training is certified via AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, by trained evaluators. Certification of
the AF Form 8 eliminates the requirement to document STS items in this CFETP.
3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority. Also, the AFCFM will initiate an annual
review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel
will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will
eliminate duplicate training.

award of the 3-skill level and senior badge upon award of the 7-skill level. 1A8XX Airmen are authorized to
optionally wear the master badge as a Master Sergeant (E-7) or above with five years in the specialty from award of
the 1A8XX AFS. Chief Master Sergeants (E-9) cross-flowed into 1A800 are authorized to optionally wear the basic
badge upon award of the AFS, senior badge after one year and master badge after five years.
6. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire
spectrum of training requirements for the Airborne ISR Operator specialty. This CFETP was developed to include
life-cycle (day one through retirement) training requirements for this specialty. The spectrum includes a strategy for
when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce
duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.
6.1. Initial Skills Training. Significant changes were made in initial skills training. The STS was changed to
include Aircrew Fundamentals Course and the Intelligence Fundamentals Course to align common core training
among all 1AXXX and 1NXXX AFSCs.
6.2. Five Level Upgrade Training. The Intelligence Fundamentals 1NX51 CDC was added as a pre-requisite
volume prior to starting the AFSC 1A852 CDC. Completion of all CDC sets provides required training for upgrade
in the Airborne ISR Operator- related positions.

                                                          11
6.3. Seven Level Upgrade Training. The CSAF has approved a variance, eliminating the requirement for in-
residence 7-level training for all 1AXXX (Aircrew Operations Career Field) personnel.
6.4. Cryptologic Training. The National Cryptologic School (NCS), run by NSA offers a variety of in-residence,
exportable, self-paced, or distance learning courses. These courses provide training across a broad spectrum of
topics. Local training managers maintain information on course listings.
6.5. Intern Programs. NSA offers various intern programs for Airborne ISR Operators. While the primary
purpose of these intern programs is to develop airborne ISR analyst skills with broad intelligence skills, individuals
applying for these programs are still required to meet all flying gates.
7. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon completion of Basic Military
Training. CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Sciences (AAS) Degree. Enlisted
members attending Army, Navy, and or DoD initial or advanced training do not receive resident credit for these

8.1. The flow outlined in figure 2 (above) represents the formal training courses required for personnel entering and
becoming fully qualified in the Airborne ISR Operator Specialty. The locations, course lengths, and titles are
subject to change. Changes will be updated in the Education Training Course Announcement by the course owner.
8.2. The course flow has been developed and agreed upon by the MAJCOM functional managers to minimize days
students are awaiting training and to ensure survival training is received prior to Initial Qualification Training,
minimizing the impact of not having the prerequisites completed before entering weapons system training.

Section B – Course Objective List
4. Measurement. Each objective is indicated as follows: W indicates task or subject knowledge, which is
measured using a written test. PC indicates required task performance, which is measured with a performance
progress check. P indicates required task performance, which is measured with a performance test. PC/W indicates
separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress
check.

5. Standard. The minimum standard is 70% on written examinations. Standards for performance measurement are
indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist. Instructor assistance is provided as
needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory
performance is attained.

6. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the ―2b‖ proficiency level which means the students can
do most parts of the task, but do need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient). The student
can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.
