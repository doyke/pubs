This instruction establishes specific requirements for defensive systems (DS) on C-5 and C-17
aircraft. Flares are directional firing munitions, that pose additional hazards because of their
potential destructive capabilities if inadvertently activated on the ground. Aircraft armed with
DS require special parking, notification, and handling procedures. Procedures identified in this
instruction apply to all individuals, including aircrews, who are actively engaged in the
operation, uploading, downloading, and troubleshooting of the DS systems. This instruction

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: Non-specific grammatical changes; clarified crew composition for each aircraft;
changes in squadron responsibilities for flare upload and download procedures.
1. General. The procedures outlined below, must be followed to ensure the reliability and
safety of personnel and equipment involved in daily operations involving the Countermeasures
Dispensing System (CMDS). This system uses Hazard Class/Division 1.3 munitions that require
special handling and coordination by all organizations involved. Any recommended changes or
additions to this instruction must be coordinated through all agencies involved with 436 Air
Wing (AW)/SEW having final approval authority.
2. Crew Composition. A flare load crew for C-17s and C-5s consists of two load qualified
technicians and one safety observer.
3. Training Requirements. The 736 and 436 Aircraft Maintence Squadron /Weapons Task
Qualification Manager (736 AMXS/ WTQM; 436 AMXS/WTQM) is responsible for training
and certifying CMDS crewmembers. Annual refresher training will include classroom
instruction and task qualification by the WTQM/WTQC and documented in applicable
maintenance training records.
     3.1. All maintenance personnel handling flares for DS aircraft will accomplish the Base
     Training Course (SAFE 000538) annually prior to flare training.
4. Parking Restrictions.
     4.1. Flare operations will only be conducted in designated locations identified on the base
     explosive map (B2, B3, C2, C3, D2, and spots E thru CC). Explosive loaded aircraft are
     prohibited in maintenance hangars and on associated parking aprons.
     4.2. Aircraft on adjacent spots to flare operations will not conduct fueling operations, run
     engines, or service liquid oxygen (LOX). Adjacent aircraft Auxiliary Power Units (APU)
     may be utilized as required.
     4.3. The use of explosive loaded aircraft for static display or exercise scenarios is prohibited.
     4.4. C-5 Specific Parking Restrictions.
        4.4.1. Anytime the aircraft visor is open while flares are loaded, the CMDS becomes a
        forward firing ordnance. Flare dispensers pose an additional hazard because of their
        directional response and potential long range if inadvertently activated on the ground.
        4.4.2. No personnel/equipment will stand, stop, or park within 100 feet directly in front
        of a flare loaded C-5 with the visor open unless associated with cargo loading/unloading
        operations. See Attachment 2.
5. Fire Protection.
     5.1. Posting of fire hazard symbol placards for flare loaded DS aircraft or entry control
     points ARE NOT REQUIRED. The notification of the Fire Department (x-4401) is
     required when each DS aircraft is flare uploaded or downloaded, identifying aircraft tail
     number, parking location, and explosive involved. The Fire Department will be notified
     promptly by MOC each time flares are uploaded or downloaded from DS aircraft.
DOVERAFBI 91-102 22 AUGUST 2011                                                                 3


      5.1.1. Applicable fire hazard symbol (HC/D 1.3, 1.4 Explosives) placards are required
      for all aircraft loading/downloading explosives as cargo on Main Ramp and aircraft
      parked in the Transient Alert (TA) explosive sited areas.
   5.2. Fire fighting procedures for MJU-10/B, MJU-7A/B, MJU-50, MJU-51, MJU-53, and
   MJU-62 countermeasures flares.
      5.2.1. Halon or water-type fire extinguishers will not be used directly on pyrotechnic
      (flares) or magnesium fires since they may intensify the fire, increase the risk of
      explosion, or spread the fire. However 2A:10BC dry chemical fire extinguishers can be
      used, and there are two of these fire extinguishers mounted on every flare delivery
      vehicle. Halon or water-type fire extinguishers should only be used to fight secondary
      fires that result.
      5.2.2. Designated fire guard(s) will attempt to extinguish the fire until the base fire
      department arrives or until munitions are engulfed in flames.
      5.2.3. When explosives are involved in a mishap not including fire, such as dropped
      munitions or partially armed munitions, clear the area initially to a distance of 300 feet.
      After evaluation of the situation, the Incident Commander may adjust the withdrawal
      distance for non-essential personnel. The minimum withdrawal distance for personnel
      and equipment if flares are involved in a fire emergency situation is 600 feet.
6. Aircraft Emergency with Flares On-board.
   6.1. Aircraft ground emergency with flares on-board.
      6.1.1. If flares are involved or suspected to be involved in a ground emergency, all
      personnel and equipment must be pulled away from the ground emergency aircraft a
      distance of at least 300 feet. This would require the clearing of one (1) aircraft parking
      spot on either side of the aircraft experiencing the ground emergency. Additionally, no
      aircraft would be allowed to taxi in front or behind the aircraft experiencing the ground
      emergency.
   6.2. Aircraft in-flight emergency (IFE) with flares on-board.
      6.2.1. The aircraft commander notifies the control tower of the nature of the emergency.
      The control tower will ring out the primary crash net.
      6.2.2. Command Post notifies the Fire Department, MOC, and the applicable AMXS
      Production Superintendent of the presence of flares and the number remaining (if
      known).
      6.2.3. If the IFE is flare related and hung flares are suspected, then the following
      procedures will be followed.
          6.2.3.1. The aircrew will:
              6.2.3.1.1. Verify that the DS is safed according to all system safety procedures
              before landing.
              6.2.3.1.2. Avoid bringing the aircraft to a full stop anywhere on the ramp that
              might restrict the flow of emergency and maintenance vehicles from responding
              to a hung flare condition and increase the safety risk to aircraft and crew. Taxi to

                arm/de-arm area located approach end of runway 19.
                6.2.3.1.3. Deplane a scanner or loadmaster to visually check for hung flares. If a
                hung flare is detected, the crew will shut down and then evacuate the aircraft and
                establish a 600 foot cordon around the aircraft until emergency responders arrive.
            6.2.3.2. The Command Post will:
                6.2.3.2.1. Initiate the hung flare ground emergency checklist if not received via
                crash net.
                6.2.3.2.2. Command Post/MOC will notify EOD and Wing Safety of the
                suspected hung flare condition.
            6.2.3.3. Hung flares will be made safe and downloaded by EOD personnel before
            parking the aircraft on the main ramp.
7. Flare Load Coordination.
     7.1. The Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) notifies Current Operations and Plans and
     Scheduling of DS tasking for Dover AFB.
     7.2. Current Operations will notify the following agencies to perform their required actions
     via Plans and Scheduling and the daily schedule.
        7.2.1. Plans and Scheduling, through the MXG Production meeting, plans and schedules
        the event, i.e., select aircraft tail number, coordinate aircraft availability, indicate
        configuration, schedule time line, and establish requirements in daily/weekly flying
        schedule.
        7.2.2. MXS Muntions Flight will assemble flares, load assembled flares into modules
        designated for mission or training employment, and deliver loaded modules to the
        flightline for installation on the aircraft.
        7.2.3. The applicable AMXS Flare Load Team Supervisor will ensure authorized
        personnel are at the aircraft to validate proper modules for assigned tasking (Training or
        Mission) and load flares into the aircraft.
        7.2.4. AMXS Electronic Warfare sections are responsible for CMDS maintenance,
        maintenance of flare dispensers, and flare load standardization training and certification.
8. Flare Load Process.
     8.1. Plans and Scheduling will advise the MOC to accomplish the following actions:
        8.1.1. Advise MXS Production Supervisor, Munitions, Fire Department, and the
        applicable AMXS Production Supervisor of the aircraft tail number, location, and the
        required flare load.
     8.2. AMXS will accomplish the following configuration of the aircraft: flaps-up, visor down
     (C-5 only), and power-on to accomplish the flare pre-load/stray voltage checks and power-
     off to accomplish the flare upload.
     8.3. Ensure the following support equipment is available and in place: one B-1 stand (C-5
     only), one man-lift or two B-2 stands (C-5 only), NF-2 light cart (if necessary), and two Fire

   Hazard placards; one for the nose and one for the tail of the aircraft (placards are not required
   on Dover AFB main ramp).
   8.4. AMXS Production Expeditors will advise the Flare Load Team when the flare
   preload/stray voltage checks can begin.
   8.5. AMXS flare load team will perform pre-load/stray voltage checks.
   8.6. The stray voltage checks are good for 24 hours as long as power is not applied to the aircraft.
   8.7. The Flare Load Crew Supervisor is responsible for the safe execution of flare upload/
   download operations and will be the contact for personnel approaching the Primary
   Explosive Safety Zone (PESZ) during flare upload/download operations. See Attachment 4.
   8.8. While an upload/download is in progress, no visitors (non-essential personnel) except
   the load team and casuals (i.e., WTQM, WTQC, or ECM QA members) evaluating the
   upload/download operation will be within 50 feet of the aircraft.
   8.9. Any unusual or abnormal occurrence that could in the judgment of the flare load team
   compromise the safe execution of a flare upload/download operation, will be grounds for
   immediate termination of the flare upload/download operation. The Flare Load Crew
   Supervisor will utilize Operational Risk Management techniques, evaluating the potential
   hazard for validity and seriousness to determine if the flare upload/download operation can
   continue. The Flare Load Crew Supervisor will be the final authority on the decision to
   continue the flare upload/download operation.
9. Flare Loading Procedures.
   9.1. Flare load procedures should be completed before a normal home station sequence of
   events begins.
   9.2. Command Post/MOC will contact the Fire Department, EOD, Wing Safety, MXS
   Production Supervisor, and the AMXS Production Supervisor in the event of a munitions
   mishap involving the CMDS. All nonessential personnel will be evacuated a minimum of
   300 feet from the site, until the Incident Commander can evaluate and adjust the withdrawal
   distance accordingly.
   9.3. During normal duty hours (0700-1600), the AMXS Flare Load Team will contact their
   Production Supervisor to notify Excel 3 and request flare delivery approximately 30 minutes
   before upload, and after completion of the pre-load/stray voltage checks.
       9.3.1. After normal duty hours and on the weekends, the AMXS Flare Load Team will
       contact their Production Supervisor to notify Excel 3 of the flare request. Excel 3 will
       then meet the Flare Load Team at the Flare Holding Area, and allow them to retrieve and
       transport muntions as required.
   9.4. During normal duty hours (0700-1600) munitions personnel will deliver flares to the
   designated aircraft parking location.
   9.5. The AMXS Flare Load Team will perform the flare load operation. Flare load teams
   will request permission from MOC for flare upload, and provide aircraft tail number, flares
   set number, and the initials of the loaders first and last letters of their last name. MOC will in
   turn notify the Fire Department of the location of the flare loading.

      9.5.7. Flare load teams will notify MOC when flare loading is complete. MOC will in-
      turn notify the Fire Department that flare loading is done.
   9.6. Upon completion of the upload, normal maintenance may continue on the aircraft, to
   include towing operations provided that:
      9.6.1. The CMDS is safe (power removed from the CMDS, master safety switch pins
      installed, and weight on wheels switch in the NORM position).
      9.6.2. The proposed maintenance will not increase the probability of causing flare
      dispensing or create an unsafe environment.
      9.6.3. All safety practices and devices are employed
      9.6.4. All personnel working on or around the aircraft have received explosive safety
      Training. Refer to TO 11A-1-33, Handling and Maintenance of Explosive-Loaded
      Aircraft.
      9.6.5. C-17 Aircraft with flares loaded will not be jacked in any manner that would
      defeat the weight-on-wheels safety feature designed to prevent inadvertent discharge,
      however, axle/integral jacking with flares loaded is permissible IAW TO 1C-17A-2-
      07JG-10-1, Jacking and Stabilization Jacking.
      9.6.6. C-5 Aircraft with flares loaded will not be jacked in any manner that would defeat

      this doesn’t apply to Forward Fuselage Jacking, NLG Jacking, MLG Bogie Jacking,
      MLG Shock Strut Jacking, and Stabilization Jacking of the airplane. IAW TO 1C-5A-2-
      1, Jacking Safety Precautions.
10. Download Procedures.
   10.1. In the event of a hung flare or explosive incident/accident involving flares, Command
   Post/MOC must immediately notify EOD, Fire Department, Wing Safety, and the respective
   AMXS Production Expediter.
   10.2. It is acceptable to temporarily download flares to perform short maintenance actions at
   the same location, and then immediately re-upload flares following maintenance. Flares will
   be placed in the flare storage containers during the short maintenance actions. If, for any
   reason, the maintenance cannot be completed within a reasonable amount of time, then flares
   will have to be turned over to Munitions Flight.
      10.2.1. If flares need to be turned over after normal duty hours or on the weekends, the
      AMXS Flare Load Team will contact their Production Supervisor to notify Excel 3 of the
      flare pickup request. Excel 3 will then meet the Flare Load Team at the Flare Holding
      Area, and allow them to store the downloaded munitions.
   10.3. AMXS Flare Load Team will perform the flare download operation. Flare load teams
   will request permission from MOC for flare download, and provide aircraft tail number and
   the initials of the loader’s first and last letters of their last name. MOC will in-turn notify the
   Fire Department of the location of the flare downloading.
      10.3.1. Line thru “INFO NOTE” previously entered for documenting flare upload.

        10.3.2. Flare load teams will notify MOC when flare downloading is complete. MOC
        will in-turn notify the Fire Department when flare downloading is done.
     10.4. During normal duty hours (0700-1600), the AMXS Flare Load Team will contact their
     Production Supervisor to notify Excel 3 and request flare pickup.
        10.4.1. After normal duty hours and on the weekends, the AMXS Flare Load Team will
        contact their Production Supervisor to notify Excel 3 of the flare pickup request. Excel 3
        will then meet the Flare Load Team at the Flare Holding Area, and allow them to store
        the downloaded munitions.
11. Flare Expiration Considerations.
     11.1. Given that Dover’s flare handling guidelines could result in flares remaining on an
     aircraft for an extended period of time on a variety of missions, the following procedures will
     be followed to prevent aircraft operations with expired flares on board:
        11.1.1. Munitions will track which flares are on each aircraft and when the associated
        flare service life is due to expire.
        11.1.2. Munitons will conduct a flightline sweep each morning to verify which flare sets are
        loaded on each aircraft, and address any discrepancies with the applicable AMXS Production.
        11.1.3. Excel 3 will coordinate with the applicable AMXS Production for flare
        downloads as required to prevent flares from expiring on-board the aircraft.
12. Aircrew Procedures for Flying Training Missions with Flares On-Board.
     12.1. When flying training missions, leave the CMDS off unless training is planned to
     include dispensing flares.

Terms
CASUALS— Persons not normally part of an explosive operation but have duties that require
their presence, such as quality assurance, safety, or inspection personnel.
EXPLOSIVE LOADED AIRCRAFT— An aircraft is considered EXPLOSIVES-LOADED
when it carries munitions or explosives, internally or externally, including nuclear weapons.
HUNG FLARE— An aircraft loaded flare which failed to function or fire where the ejection
end shows EVIDENCE of flare material and the weather seal is DAMAGED or MISSING. This
flare presents a more hazardous condition than a normal flare.
PRIMARY EXPLOSIVE SAFETY ZONE (PESZ)— A unmarked boundary that extends 50
feet around the aircraft to create an essential-personnel-only safety area during flare load
operations.
VISITORS— Non-essential personnel with limited access to the PESZ. Stop operations when
visitors are present.
