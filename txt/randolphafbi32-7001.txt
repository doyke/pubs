                                           Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Background. Landscapes on Randolph AFB have the potential to significantly impact the
base in four primary areas. First, the primary mission of the base is a major flying training base
and landscapes can attract birds that are hazards to flying. Second, the base is historically
significant, having 349 structures designated as historic and listed on the National Registry of
Historic Places. Third, the base has the image and should be preserved as the ―Showplace of the
Air Force‖. Finally, with careful application, landscaping has the potential to reduce energy
consumption while enhancing our quality of life. The base NRM is responsible for developing
and implementing a landscaping program designed to improve the visual appearance and
environmental quality of the base while avoiding adverse impact on the base.

   1.1.1. Water conservation and usage are sensitive issue in the San Antonio area. Randolph
   AFB, along with the local metropolitan area that receives their water from the Edwards
   Aquifer, must use this regulated water wisely. The Edwards Aquifer (EA) is an underground
   water source that encompasses approximately 4,500 square miles in eight counties in south
   central Texas. This aquifer is the sole source of potable drinking water for this area. The
   Edwards Aquifer Authority (EAA) regulates the withdrawal of water from this aquifer. The
   EAA, under it regulatory authority, can challenge any pumping from the aquifer that it feels
   is wasteful and unnecessarily impacts this water source. Furthermore, as EA water is linked
   to endangered species and their habitats, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
   monitors EA withdrawal actions to ensure these species and their habitats are protected.

   1.1.2. Everyone wants a beautiful landscape, but people often do not fully understand the
   impact on the base when this want becomes a reality. Any landscape action, whether to
   create a new landscape or simply modify the existing landscape by planting a tree or shrub,
   has many costs. The costs include not only the material and labor to install the landscape,
   but the manpower and water to perpetrate it. Along with water conservation, continuation of
   care and maintenance to ensure landscapes remain healthy and add to the areas beauty are the
   most important elements.

1.2. Purpose. Ensure all new landscape designs or proposed changes to existing landscapes are
coordinates with the 12th Mission Support Group Civil Engineer Division (12 MSG/CE) prior to
finalization and implementation. This will ensure that designs are in accordance with established
landscape, grounds maintenance, and land management regulations, policies and guidance.

   1.2.1. Develop and implement procedures for requesting and processing landscape actions.
   Landscape actions include, but are not limited to, design of new landscapes; modifications of
   existing landscapes; implementation of landscape actions without formal written designs or
   coordination; and replacing one vegetation type with dissimilar type (i.e., turf to planting
   bed, planting bed to turf, turf grass to groundcover, etc.).

   1.2.2. Define the duties and responsibilities of personnel and activities involved in
   landscaping Randolph AFB or its supported properties at Seguin Auxiliary Airfield and
   Canyon Lake recreational area.

1.3. Goal. The goal is to allow base personnel maximum flexibility and input in the selection of
plants in designing their landscapes, but ensure their designs meet base standards for
4                                          RANDOLPHAFBI32-7001            4 NOVEMBER 2008

landscaping. This is to ensure consistency with currently accepted professionally recommended
low-water –demand and heat-tolerant Xeriscape landscapes.

1.4. Objectives. The objectives are to design, install and maintain low-maintenance, water
conserving, and drought-tolerant-type landscapes that complement and enhance Randolph AFB’s
image as the ―Showplace of the Air Force‖. These objectives will be achieved by implementing
the following concepts—pride and ownership of the landscape, water conservation in the
landscape, and low-maintenance landscapes.

    1.4.1. Pride and Ownership of the Landscape.

       1.4.1.1. Ownership is an important concept that goes beyond dollar costs. Therefore, any
       person or activity who wants to landscape their areas must take ownership and factor into
       their plan the necessary requirements to ensure the landscape enhances the beauty of the
       base and does not become a distraction from the lack of proper maintenance.

       1.4.1.2. Individuals or activities asking to undertake a landscape project who do not
       intend to maintain the landscape after it is planted must make sure coordination and
       approval is obtained from the NRM and 12 MSG Maintenance Engineering Grounds (12
       MSG/CEOSS) maintenance QAP prior to initiating an AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer
       Work Request, for landscaping actions. Any landscape that increases the base grounds
       maintenance contractor’s workload must be coordinates with the 12 MSG/CEOSS QAP
       responsible for managing the contractor’s work schedule. The 12 MSG/CEOSS must
       accept, in writing, this increased workload before the NRM will consider the landscaping.

    1.4.2. Water Conservation in the Landscape. Water used in landscape irrigation is not
    considered by EAA as one of the critical and essential uses of EA water. Therefore, when
    using EA water to support base landscapes, the proposed landscape design must demonstrate
    water conservation and efficient water use. There are several water-conservation techniques
    when developing a landscape design. These techniques include selecting low-water
    demand/drought-tolerant plants, using mulches and compost to improve the water-holding
    capacity of the soil, and utilizing soaker hoses and drip irrigation to effectively and
    efficiently deliver only the necessary amount of water to the plants, etc.

    1.4.3. Low-Maintenance Landscapes. Proposed landscape design must show they are low-
    maintenance landscapes and will not result, when implemented, in a significant maintenance
    burden on the requester or base. All landscapes will require some level of effort (manpower)
    and watering to ensure they remain attractive and healthy. However, the landscape design
    should be able to demonstrate it will not be a maintenance burden. They key in designing a
    low-maintenance landscape is to select plants that grow and look good without requiring
    extensive or routine (weekly, monthly, etc) management actions.

1.5. Landscape Requirements. The four critical components for a landscape to be successful
are water and irrigation, plant type, installation or planting, and maintenance. The majority of
the landscapes that fail are the result of not adhering to or implementing these components into
the landscape plan.

    1.5.1. Water and Irrigation.
RANDOLPHAFBI32-7001          4 NOVEMBER 2008                                                  5

     1.5.1.1. Apply adequate water to the plants in the landscape by an efficient and effective
     method that will conserve water as discussed in paragraph 1.4.2, Water Conservation in
     the Landscape. Adequate water is defined as the amount of water needed to ensure the
     plant remains healthy and is not stressed due to insufficient water. Overwatering, as well
     as under watering, will stress the plants and is not acceptable. It is important to
     remember when designing a landscape that all plants do not require the same amount of
     water.

     1.5.1.2. The climate where Randolph AFB is located can be very stressful and hazardous
     to most landscapes due to the inconsistent amounts of annual rainfall that require the
     addition of supplemental water by irrigation. Consistently, annual rainfalls are below the
     expected average of 25 inches and summers are characteristically with long periods (over
     80 days) of high (over 90 degrees) temperatures.

     1.5.1.3. Below-normal rainfalls are usually referred to as droughts. These droughts are
     common to south central Texas, and can vary in duration from several weeks to many
     months and in severity from below-normal rainfall to no rainfall. Therefore, all
     landscapes will require some level of supplemental watering to make up for inconsistent
     and below-normal amounts of ―natural‖ rainfall.

     1.5.1.4. The amount of supplemental water required will depend on the plant type and
     location of plant in the landscape (i.e., amount of exposure to sun or shade). As a rule,
     the greater the exposure to sun (i.e., the more open the area), the greater amount of water
     will be needed to keep the landscape healthy and growing.

     1.5.1.5. When the landscape receives inadequate watering, one of the following
     situations will occur:

         1.5.1.5.1. Nothing because the plant has adapted to tolerate low levels of water.

         1.5.1.5.2. Plant will become dormant until sufficient soil moisture occurs.

         1.5.1.5.3. Plant Dies.

     1.5.1.6. The first situation is what happens to most native or adapted plants once they
     have become established at the planting site. The second situation is what is expected to
     happen to plants considered to be ―drought tolerant‖ like Bermuda grass and Buffalo
     grass. The last situation is what is expected to happen when any plant does not get
     sufficient water. The plant can be native or adapted, established or not established and
     depends on the plant and where it is in the landscape.

     1.5.1.7. Plants need water to survive. The amount and frequency of water vary within
     plant species. To conserve water in the landscape, whoever is maintaining the landscape
     must understand the plants water requirement. Some plants may require over 40 inches
     of water a year (lawns, certain climbing ivy, etc.). Others may require less than 20 inches
     (Lantana, Desert Willow, etc.) and some can be trained to require less water (St.
     Augustine grass).

  1.5.2. Use of Native or Adaptive Plants.
6                                           RANDOLPHAFBI32-7001              4 NOVEMBER 2008

       1.5.2.1. The use of native or locally adapted plants that are horticulturally suited to local
       soil conditions are usually authorized. Exotic plants are not authorized as they have
       special soil and water requirements. Not all native plants will be recommended for
       Randolph AFB landscapes. Many native plants, (e.g., plants naturally occurring in this
       region) would be considered weeds. Conversely, many plants naturally growing in this
       area are not native, such as mesquite, Bermuda grass, and Buffalo grass, which are
       introduced/adapted species.

       1.5.2.2. Xeriscape landscaping has become a command-directed initiative that is further
       complicated because of the wide geographical diversity of the personnel assigned to the
       base. This geographical diversity has resulted in plants requested by base personnel to
       use in their landscapes being selected because the plants are a positive reminder of their
       home area, previous assignments or simply look appealing.

       1.5.2.3. Native and adapted plants located in natural settings should be able to survive
       and remain healthy with naturally occurring rainfall amounts. However, in areas that
       receive stress from large numbers of ―heat-attractant/radiant sources‖ like buildings,
       sidewalks, streets and compacted soils, supplemental watering will be required to prevent
       plants (turf grasses, shrubs and trees) from losing water when heat stressed.

       1.5.2.4. The use of exotic plants (i.e.; plants not native to this area or have been
       horticulturally adapted to this area) are permitted on Randolph AFB only when grown in
       containers.

       1.5.2.5. Selecting and planting only native and adapted plants will require special care
       and watering until they become established (i.e., their roots grow out their level of
       watering can be reduced, often to amounts of water less than normally received during
       ―natural‖ rainfalls. However, during periods of severe drought, some supplemental
       watering may be needed when the plant shows symptoms of water stress.

    1.5.3. Proper Plant Installation.

       1.5.3.1. Proper installation includes ensuring the planting site is ready for the plant. This
       includes removing unwanted and competing vegetation that will take food and water
       away from the installed plant. It also involves breaking up the soil in the planting site to
       reduce compaction, improve drainage and soil aeration.

       1.5.3.2. Proper planting of plants includes ensuring the planting hole is of proper depth,
       using compost and mulch to improve soil conditions, and conserving water. The use of
       cloths and plastics as weed barriers are not approved because they do not prevent weeds
       from invading the planting site, increase maintenance and prevent water and oxygen from
       getting to the plants.

    1.5.4. Care/Maintenance. The proper care/maintenance necessary to maintain a healthy and
    attractive landscape is determined by the landscape design. The design is not only concerned
    with the physical layout of the planting, but the type of plants selected. Plants should be
    chosen based on maintenance level required to keep them healthy and looking good. The
    amount and frequency of watering is another important factor. Watering must be
    incompliance with the water management plan. The more water the landscape requires will
    translate into more maintenance. Personnel have to make sure the landscape is being
    properly watered and water is not running off onto the sidewalks and streets. A final factor is
RANDOLPHAFBI32-7001          4 NOVEMBER 2008                                               7

  some plants only last for a short period of time and must be removed or replaced. This is
  common when plants called annuals are used in the landscape. The visual effect of these
  plants is usually seasonal or even shorter (less than a month), and must be replaced or the
  landscape appears unattractive.

                              DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. 12 MSG/CEAN Natural Resources Manager (NRM).

    2.1.1. The NRM is the base’s designated technical and professional land management
    authority responsible for developing and monitoring this policy, as well as the following
    plans, that are designed to protect, preserve, and enhance base natural resources (i.e.,
    landscape, etc.).

       2.1.1.1. Randolph AFB integrated natural resources management plan.

       2.1.1.2. Randolph AFB integrated landscape, grounds maintenance, and urban forestry
       plan.

       2.1.1.3. Randolph AFB landscape design, care, and maintenance policy.

    2.1.2. The NRM and Cultural Resources Manager (CRM) will establish Randolph AFB
    landscape policies and procedures in accordance with all applicable AETC, USAF, DoD, and
    other federal policies, directives, executive orders, etc., for the protection, preservation, and
    enhancement of natural resources under the jurisdiction of the federal government.

    2.1.3. The NRM and CRM will review all new landscape designs or any design that will
    change more than 10% of the existing landscape. This review is to ensure the design
    conforms to existing base, major command, and Air Force regulations/guidance for natural
    resource protection and enhancement.

2.2. 12 MSG/CEOSS Grounds Maintenance QAP.

    2.2.1. The 12 MSG/CEOSS grounds maintenance QAP is the base’s grounds maintenance
    contract manager responsible for contractor-implemented land management, landscape and
    urban forestry plans and programs established by the base NRM.

    2.2.2. The 12 MSG/CEOSS grounds maintenance QAP will coordinate all landscape
    proposals known to or expected to result in a change of over 10% of the existing base building
    or site landscape with the NRM prior to undertaking the landscape action. Minor landscape
    actions (i.e., impacting less than 10% of affected site’s landscape) will not require NRM prior
    coordination, providing the action meets all criteria discussed in paragraph 1.5, Landscape
    Requirements.

    2.2.3. When directed, the 12 MSG/CEPM-1 landscape architect may be tasked to develop or
    prepare landscape designs and/or cost estimates. Landscape designs will include, but not be
    limited to, preparation of a list of recommended plants, a plant siting, planting bed design, and
    costs or plants and plant material to install the proposed landscape, etc. These designs when
    approved by the NRM, and cost estimates will be provided for review and approval by the
    requester. The requester will be responsible for funding all landscape projects not funded
    through 12 MSG.
RANDOLPHAFBI32-7001            4 NOVEMBER 2008                                               9

   2.2.4. The 12 MSG/CEOSS grounds maintenance QAP will ensure all proposed landscape
   designs, once installed, will not create an increased maintenance burden on the base grounds
   maintenance contractor. When the proposed design or plan will require the base grounds
   maintenance contractor to maintain the landscape, the 12 MSG/CEOSS grounds maintenance
   QAP will provide this information during the NRM’s review of the project.

   2.2.5. The 12 MSG/CEOSS grounds maintenance QAP will coordinate with the requester as
   needed to gather sufficient information to produce a landscape design proposal incorporating
   the requester’s landscape concept. This coordination will be done in a timely manner that
   maximizes the effectiveness of available resources.

2.3. Housing Residents, Base Activities and Contractors.

   2.3.1. Any housing resident, base activity, or contractor who desires to modify the existing
   landscape or create a new landscape will, for this policy, be hereafter referred to as the
   requester.

   2.3.2. The requester may elect to choose either of the following approved landscape options.
   Regardless of the option chosen, the requester is responsible for ensuring all landscape
   designs have been coordinated with the NRM and 12 MSG/CEOSS grounds maintenance
   QAP as appropriate.

      2.3.2.1. Option 1. The requester will prepare and submit an AF Form 332 to the 12
      MSG/CEOSS grounds maintenance QAP for base funded and provided landscaping
      assistance.

      2.3.2.2. Option 2. The requester undertakes a self-help landscape project by submitting
      AFF 332 before using base-supplied or unit-purchased landscape materials, but uses the
      requester’s resources to produce the proposed landscape design for review by the base
      NRM and 12 MSG/CEOSS grounds maintenance QAP.

   2.3.3. The requester will ensure:

      2.3.3.1. All landscaping requests and designs are coordinated with the NRM and 12
      MSG/CEOSS ground maintenance QAP as appropriate prior to commencing with the
      installation of plant material or changing the existing landscape.

      2.3.3.2. The installed landscape is given sufficient and proper care/maintenance to remain
      healthy.

      2.3.3.3. All landscape practices, methods, and materials used are those recommended for
      the plants selected; and consistent with established base regulations and policies. All
      landscapes must be protected to the maximum degree possible to prevent significant injury
      periods of prolonged drought or extreme temperature fluctuations characteristic in this
      area.

      2.3.3.4. All proposed landscape designs are low maintenance and incorporated the use of
      low-water demand native/adapted plants and maintenance practices.

                                          Chapter 3

                                       PROCEDURES

3.1. General. The following procedures are summarized in an attached flowchart at the end of
this policy. This summary is intended to provide a simplified overview of the procedures
discussed in earlier chapters.

3.2. Step 1, Required Coordination.

   3.2.1. Developing a landscape design/plan for implementation on Randolph AFB and its
   supported off-base properties, and proper coordination with the appropriate base NRM and
   base program implementation authority (12 MSG/CEOSS grounds maintenance QAP) are
   critical.

   3.2.2. All requests for design of new landscapes or changes in existing landscapes will be
   initiated with AFF 332, and coordinated with the base NRM and 12 MSG/CEOSS grounds
   maintenance QAP.

   3.2.3. Written approval from the 12 MSG/CEOSS grounds maintenance QAP will be
   required when they proposed plan increases the base grounds maintenance contractor’s
   workload.

   3.2.4. All landscape requests resulting in a change to the existing landscape in the Randolph
   AFB historic district will be coordinated with the base CRM. The CRM, when necessary, will
   submit landscape designs to the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) for review and
   comment. The SHPO is the state agency responsible for ensuring facilities that have been
   designated as historic and the land on which they are located are protected in accordance with
   appropriate state and federal laws.

   3.2.5. Prior to excavation and planting trees or shrubs, personnel must have an approved AF
   Form 103, Work Clearance Request. Clearance will be coordinated through 12 MSG/CEOI
   chief of infrastructure for approval in accordance with the civil engineer DOI 85-5.

3.3. Step 2, Landscape Design/Plan Development and Review.

   3.3.1. The requester can produce landscape design assistance and cost estimates from the 12
   MSG/CEPM-1 landscape architect. This assistance is subject to approval from 12 MSG/CE.

   3.3.2. When the 12 MSG/CEPM-1 landscape architect is tasked to develop a landscape
   design and cost estimates, they will coordinate this request with the NRM. The 12
   MSG/CEOSS grounds maintenance QAP will ensure the base NRM and CRM review the
   finalized landscape design or plan.

   3.3.3. When funding is required to implement the proposed landscape project and is not
   within the approving authority or the requester or 12 MSG, the requester, in conjunction with
   the 12 MSG/CEPM-1 landscape architect, will develop the appropriate staffing packet to
   submit the landscape cost estimates to the appropriate approving authority for approval. The
   proposed landscape design or plan will be considered finalized and reviewed by the NRM and
12                                            RANDOLPHAFBI32-7001              4 NOVEMBER 2008

     CRM as appropriate prior to being submitted to the funding approval authority. This
     procedure will expedite the approval process and ensure the funding approval authority that
     all required coordination has been accomplished.

     3.3.4. When funding is not the responsibility of the requester and funding availability
     constraints occur preventing the immediate implementation of the approved design, the
     requester will be notified as to the status and priority of the design. The project will then be
     placed in an on-hold status pending availability of funds.

3.4. Step 3, Landscape Design/Plan Implementation.

     3.4.1. Implementation is herein defined as the purchase and/or installation of landscape
     materials. The procurement of landscape materials through the base Self-help Store does not
     eliminate the requester’s requirement for coordinating as discussed in paragraph 3.1, Step 1,
     Required Coordination. In addition, landscaping as part of a base construction project (minor
     or major construction project) does not eliminate this coordination process. The process is
     intended not to hamper the action, but to ensure the proposed landscape conforms to base
     standards.

     3.4.2. NRM coordination prior to the implementation of any major landscape designs (major
     actions such as landscaping associated with major construction projects) will occur prior to
     obligation of government funds or resources to ensure compliance with the National
     Environmental Policy Act and Air Force Environmental Impact Analysis Process.

     3.4.3. The NRM or 12 MSG/CEOSS grounds maintenance QAP will be responsible for
     conducting a visual inspection of landscape materials prior to the materials being installed to
     ensure the plants are healthy and accessory materials (i.e., compost, mulch, soils, etc.) are of
     acceptable quality.

        3.4.3.1. Any plants incorrectly installed (i.e., planted too close to structures, building
        foundations, utilities, other plants, etc.) will be relocated at no cost to the government. It
        will be assumed that all incorrectly or improperly installed landscape materials have not
        been done in accordance with the final approved design or plan.

        3.4.3.2. When conflicts occur from noncompliance with approved designs, the requester
        can be directed to remove, restore or otherwise correct any landscaping problems
        associated with the actions; and assume any costs associated with this corrective action.

     3.4.4. The NRM or 12 MSG/CEOSS grounds maintenance QAP will conduct periodic on-site
     inspections of these landscape projects to ensure compliance with this policy and any other
     approved landscape plans, policies, and guidance.

     3.4.5. All plants to be selected for installation of Randolph AFB and its supported properties
     must be selected from the list of plants provided in the Randolph AFB integrated landscape,
     grounds maintenance, and urban forestry plan. This plan provides a list of all plants
     recommended for the area of Texas where the base and its supported properties are located.
     All plants listed in this area are not available through the base Self-help Store. Therefore, if
     the requesting individual or activity desires to use plants not available from the store, they are
RANDOLPHAFBI32-7001             4 NOVEMBER 2008                                                     13

   authorized to obtain plants providing they are on the approved list or the requester has
   received a waiver from the NRM.

3.5. Step 4, Landscape Care/Maintenance.

   3.5.1. The requester is responsible for ensuring the landscape has proper care/maintenance
   and that sites are kept clean and aesthetically pleasing. This responsibility (i.e., ownership) is
   not waived even for areas maintained by the base grounds maintenance contractor.

   3.5.2. Requesters are approved to use the I Love Randolph Program as a means to perform
   required care/maintenance operations on their landscape. It is recognized that maintenance or
   attractive landscapes is beneficial to the base’s image as the ―Showplace of the Air Force‖ and
   does improve base natural resources. Also, well-maintained landscapes should not become an
   attraction (i.e., fruit-bearing trees) for birds and other wildlife that would increase bird aircraft
   strike hazard concerns, and adversely impact the base’s flying training mission.

   3.5.3. Requesters who fail to properly maintain their landscape will be reported to their
   leadership and organizations could be required to pay any costs incurred to maintain the
   landscape in a healthy and presentable fashion.
