This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 24-2, Preparation and Movement of Air
Force Materiel. It establishes procedures for the preservation, handling and storage of 463L pallets and
nets by the users on Westover Air Reserve Base. It explains the responsibilities of the Base and Unit Pallet
and Net Managers. It applies to all organizations assigned pallets and nets.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision aligns the
instruction with AFPD 24-2 and changes the series from 76 to 24.


1. Responsibilities. The Operations Group Air Transportation Manager (42 APS/OSN) is designated as
the Pallet and Net Manager and ensures all units appoint a primary and alternate Pallet and Net Control
Monitor. OSN is responsible for the Pallet and Net Program.

2. Unit Pallet and Net Managers.
   2.1. Establish stringent control over all pallets and nets assigned. Unit managers complete a visual
   inventory of pallets and nets quarterly. Any differences in quantity from the previous quarter is
   reported to 42 APS/OSN no later than the last work day of the quarter.
   2.2. Safeguard assigned nets and pallets. Ensure all pallets and nets are stored or used as prescribed
   by AFI 24-203, Management and Use of Pallets and Nets (Joint), Technical Order (T.O.)
   35D33-2-2-2, Handling and Maintaining Pallets, and T.O. 35D33-2-3-1, Handling and Maintaining
   Nets.
   2.3. Inspect pallets and nets prior to and after each use. If corrosion, wear, or damage is evident, an
   AFTO Form 350, Repairable Item Processing Tag, is sent to 439 OG/OGN. Only minor base level
   maintenance outlined in T.O. 35D33-2-2-2, Chapter 4, is accomplished at this installation.

3. Nets. All nets are stored away from direct heat sources, such as radiators or heat ducts.

4. Assignment of Pallets and Nets (Operational). All increases or decreases in pallet authorizations are
made in accordance with AFI 24-203, and forwarded to the Pallet and Net Manager.
