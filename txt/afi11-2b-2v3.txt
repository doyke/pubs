                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Scope and Responsibilities. This volume, in conjunction with other governing directives
in Attachment 1, outlines those procedures applicable to the safe operation of B-2 aircraft under
most circumstances, but is not to be used as a substitute for sound judgment or common sense.
Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe,
effective mission accomplishment. With complementary references, this volume prescribes
standard operational procedures for all USAF B-2 crews.
1.2. References, Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Terms. See Attachment 1. Training units
may develop phase manuals from the procedures contained in these documents. Phase manuals
may be used to augment initial and mission qualification training at operational units. Phase
manuals may expand these basic procedures--in no case will they be less restrictive.
1.3. Waivers.
   1.3.1. Forward waiver requests through appropriate channels to MAJCOM/A3 for approval.
   1.3.2. Unless specified in the waiver approval message, the waiver remains in effect until the
   next AFI 11-2B-2V3 version.
   1.3.3. Submit changes to this volume on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
   Publication (flight publication) using local procedures.
1.4. Deviations. Deviations from these procedures require specific approval of MAJCOM/A3

                                             Chapter 2

                                      MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The pilot in command of each aircraft and the designated flight lead are
ultimately responsible for mission planning. Crewmembers are personally responsible for
maintaining adequate knowledge of system operations, normal, and emergency procedures. The
Weapons and Tactics Flight will provide supplemental planning information as required to
effectively accomplish the assigned mission.
     2.1.1. Accomplish flight planning to insure safe accomplishment of all phases of flight. As a
     minimum, flight planning includes takeoff/landing data, fuel requirements, target
     study/weapons delivery procedures/briefing (if applicable), formation procedures (if
     applicable), and chart preparation. Review bird advisory and bird hazard information IAW
     AFI 91-102 and AFPAM 91-212. Consider and factor in foreseeable safety risks and risk
     mitigation factors in accordance with Operational Risk management (ORM).
     2.1.2. Standards. Groups may develop OG/CC approved Group/Wing standards. OG/OGV
     will review all standards to ensure standardization and compliance with AFI 11-series
     guidance.
     2.1.3. Mission planning time. SQ/CCs will provide pilots sufficient time to mission plan.
     SQ/CCs should schedule no less than four hours for mission planning when pilots have
     standardized/stereo products available (“show and go” flight profiles). SQ/CCs should
     schedule a minimum of eight hours of mission planning for actual weapons deliveries,
     airshow/flyby profiles, or any non-standard mission.
2.2. Map/chart preparation.
     2.2.1. Local Area Charts. A local area chart is not required if the unit in-flight guide includes
     jettison areas, divert information, controlled bailout areas, and provides sufficient detail of
     the local area to remain within assigned training areas.
     2.2.2. Enroute Charts. Pilots may use Flight Information Publication (FLIP) enroute charts
     instead of maps on navigational flights within areas that adequately covered by FLIP. These
     charts will be of sufficient scale to provide navigation and terrain/obstacle avoidance.
     2.2.3. PFPS/Sectional Charts.
        2.2.3.1. Pilots flying under VFR, inside the MTRs, in low-altitude MOAs, or performing
        VFR flybys in the CONUS will supplement existing mission planning materials (e.g.
        CHUM, FLIP AP/1B, etc.) with one of the following:
            2.2.3.1.1. PFPS/Falcon View with the following overlay options selected:
            airports/heliports, airspace boundaries, airways, MTR, parachute jump and SUAS
            boundaries.
            2.2.3.1.2. Sectional aeronautical charts.
     2.2.4. Low Level Charts. Low level charts and route books used during flight will be
     annotated with location and dimensions of Class A/B/C/D airspace, civil/military airfields
     and other potential high density traffic areas (e.g., parachute activity areas and ultra
AFI11-2B-2V3 3 MAY 2010                                                                         7


   light/hang glider/glider sites, etc.) within 5 NM of any planned VFR route or MTR lateral
   boundary. Applicable airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity of Class A/B/C/D
   airspace will be annotated and briefed on all such flights. In addition, annotate and brief the
   intersection of other VR/IR routes (if applicable) and any other possible areas of conflict.
       2.2.4.1. Low level charts and route books will also be annotated with a minimum safe
       altitude (MSA) or route abort altitude (RAA) for each leg, updated by the Chart Update
       Manual (CHUM), and annotated for all man-made obstacles above the planned flight
       altitude.
   2.2.5. Pilots flying outside CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM, theater or host nation
   guidance on mission planning. If no gaining MAJCOM, theater or host nation guidance
   exists, use the best charts or Falcon View overlay options available to comply with this
   instruction’s requirements.
2.3. CBRNE. Procedures for operation in a CBRNE-threat environment are contained in
Attachment 2.
2.4. Fuel Conservation. Manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious resource.
Design procedures for optimal fuel use and efficiencies throughout all phases of mission
execution, to include ground operations, flight plans, power settings, and climb/descent profiles.
Incorporate enroute tasks to make maximum use of airborne learning opportunities.
2.5. Briefing/Debriefing.
   2.5.1. The aircraft commander (AC) or flight lead (FL) establishes mission goals and
   objectives.
   2.5.2. AC/FL will present a logical briefing to promote the safe and effective mission
   accomplishment. AC/FL will brief contracts, roles, and responsibilities for all crew/flight
   members.
   2.5.3. All flight members must attend the flight briefing unless previously coordinated with
   squadron supervision. Anyone not attending the flight brief must receive a briefing on
   mission events and emergency procedures. If the interval from the initial briefing to takeoff
   exceeds 72 hours, a complete review and briefing must be re-accomplished. All crews
   involved in a formation flight must attend a formation briefing.
   2.5.4. AC/FLs will brief all items required by Air Force Instructions (AFIs) and the flight
   crew information file (FCIF). AC/FLs may use locally developed briefing guides that cover
   all AFI briefing requirements. Those items published in AFIs, Air Force Tactics, Techniques
   and Procedures (AFTTPs) Manuals, or squadron/wing standards and understood by all flight
   members may be briefed as “standard.”
   2.5.5. Alternate mission. AC/FLs will brief an appropriate alternate mission.
   2.5.6. Debriefing. AC/FLs will formally debrief every mission for all flight/crew members.
   As soon as possible after each mission, AC/FLs will review audio/visual mission recording
   media, if available.
2.6. Unit Developed Checklists/Local Pilot Aids.
 8                                                                  AFI11-2B-2V3 3 MAY 2010


     2.6.1. Except for -25 checklists, unit developed checklists may be used in lieu of flight
     manual checklists provided they contain all items (verbatim and in order) listed in the
     applicable checklist.
     2.6.2. Units will produce a pilot aid that includes as a minimum:

                           NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Ground Communications. Pilots will brief ground crews as required. Use operational
headsets to the maximum extent possible during all engine starts, pre-taxi checks, and when
technicians perform tasks on the aircraft. Use hand signals as a last resort or if required during
alert scrambles or combat operation.
3.2. Ground Visual Signals. When ground intercom is not available, use visual signals IAW
AFI 11-218. All signals pertaining to operation of aircraft systems will originate with the pilot.
The crew chief will repeat the signal when it is safe to operate the system. Pilots will not activate
any system that poses a danger to the ground crew prior to receiving proper acknowledgment
from ground personnel.
3.3. Preflight.
   3.3.1. Icing. Do not take off with visible icing (snow, frost, or ice) on any part of the
   aircraft.
   3.3.2. Flight control BITs (ABIT). Pilots will complete an ABIT of the FCS after
   performing any flight control (FC) memory reads. Pilots will not perform FC air event
   memory reads.
3.4. Taxi.
   3.4.1. Minimum taxi interval is 500 feet.
   3.4.2. Do not taxi with a reported RCR of less than 6 anywhere on the taxi route. Taxi
   routes must be cleared to a minimum of 75 feet wide for taxi RCR purposes.
   3.4.3. During normal operating procedures, maximum taxi speed is 15 knots groundspeed
   and 10 knots during turns or high gain operations. Refer to command guidance for taxi limits
   greater than 15 knots.
   3.4.4. Taxi over cables from BAK-9/BAK-15 as slow as possible not to exceed 10 knots
   ground speed.
3.5. Takeoff.
   3.5.1. Do not takeoff if any of the following conditions exist:
       3.5.1.1. The RCR is less than 9 (can be waived by OG/CC).
       3.5.1.2. Standing or pooled water is on the runway.
       3.5.1.3. The computed takeoff roll exceeds 80% of the available runway (can be waived
       by OG/CC).
       3.5.1.4. The tailwind exceeds 10 knots (can be waived by OG/CC).
       3.5.1.5. Any attitude indicator, heading indicator, or standby instrument is inoperative.
       3.5.1.6. One or more engines are inoperative from the start of takeoff roll.
 10                                                                AFI11-2B-2V3 3 MAY 2010


          3.5.1.6.1. During emergency evacuations and at the discretion of the wing
          commander or with higher headquarters approval, aircraft may takeoff with one or
          more engines inoperative. Under no circumstances should a crew take off with a
          computed takeoff distance that exceeds 95 percent of runway available.
   3.5.2. Intersection takeoffs require OG/CC approval.
   3.5.3. Runways must be cleared to 150 feet width (+/-75 feet of centerline).
   3.5.4. Do not takeoff over any raised web barrier (MA-1A or 61QS11). Do not start takeoff
   roll or land prior to approach end cables. Takeoffs accomplished beyond approach end cables
   must have 10,000 feet runway remaining, plus 1000 feet overrun and still comply with
   applicable takeoff restrictions.
3.6. Formation.
   3.6.1. Responsibilities. FLs are responsible for ensuring contracts, roles and responsibilities
   of each flight member are established, briefed, executed, and debriefed. If any flight member
   cannot meet their responsibilities, contracts, or assigned tasks then they will immediately
   communicate that information to the FL.
   3.6.2. Maximum formation size is normally three aircraft, but can be as many as 6 aircraft.
   3.6.3. Maintain a minimum of 500 feet vertical altitude separation between aircraft.
   3.6.4. Notify ATC when operating as a non-standard formation on flight plans, on initial
   ATC contact, and when contacting each subsequent controller.
   3.6.5. Radio Procedures.
      3.6.5.1. Except for wingman acknowledgement, preface all communications with the
      complete flight call \sign.       Transmit only information essential for mission
      accomplishment or safety of flight.
      3.6.5.2. Make a “knock-it-off” (KIO) or “terminate” call IAW AFI 11-214. Any flight
      member may call KIO or terminate. All participants will acknowledge a KIO by
      repeating the call.
      3.6.5.3. Acknowledge radio checks which do not require the transmission of specific
      data by individual flight members in turn (i.e. “2, 3”). Acknowledging indicates that the
      appropriate action is complete, in the process of completion, or the flight member
      understands.
      3.6.5.4. All flight members will acknowledge the initial air traffic control (ATC)
      clearance. Acknowledge subsequent ATC instructions when directed by lead.
   3.6.6. Takeoffs. Formation takeoff spacing is one minute minimum but can be waived to 30
   seconds by the OG/CC. Nuclear training multi-ship minimum interval takeoffs (MITOs)
   require OG/CC approval.
      3.6.6.1. Use caution for wake turbulence on departure, and adjust climb routing to avoid
      areas of potential wake turbulence. Appropriate fan headings will be flown for all MITOs
      to account for preceeding aircraft’s wake turbulence. If wake turbulence is encountered,
      smoothly adjust flight path laterally to exit turbulence. Do not adjust throttles and use
      caution for G limitations
AFI11-2B-2V3 3 MAY 2010                                                                      11


  3.6.7. Join-Up/Rejoin.
     3.6.7.1. Lead will ensure a minimum of 1000-foot altitude separation between each
     aircraft for formation rejoins.
     3.6.7.2. IMC. Until all wingmen report either visual or tied, FL will report passing every
     5000 feet with current and planned rollout heading (if applicable). Wingmen will echo
     their respective current altitudes and heading. Wingmen will not climb through
     preceding aircraft’s altitude until visual or tied. Wingmen will delay turns until over the
     same point as the previous aircraft.
     3.6.7.3. VMC. Wingmen may use visual cutoff to expedite rejoins. Avoid flight through
     wingtip vortices and jet wash. If encountered, immediately decouple the autopilot (if
     engaged) and unload the aircraft to approximately 1G.
  3.6.8. Formation breakup. FL will not break up formation until each wingman has a positive
  fix to navigate with, and to (visual, INS, GPS, or TACAN).
  3.6.9. Changing Leads/Position Changes:
     3.6.9.1. Accomplish lead changes from a stabilized and wings level attitude.
     3.6.9.2. Maintain a minimum of        500 feet vertical separation during lead/position
     changes.
     3.6.9.3. Initiate lead changes with a radio call. Wingmen will acknowledge the radio
     call.
     3.6.9.4. The lead change is effective upon acknowledgment.
     3.6.9.5. The former leader then moves to the appropriate wing position.
     3.6.9.6. VMC Lead/Position Changes. FL announces intention for a position/lead
     change. After wingman acknowledgement, the affected wingman moves to a line
     Abreast position with a minimum of 1000 feet wing tip spacing. Lead then directs the
     position/lead change. After wingman acknowledgment, aircraft then change altitudes
     appropriate for their new positions. The former lead/’new’ two will move aft to the
     trailing wingman position and assume radar trail.
     3.6.9.7. IMC Lead/Position Changes.
         3.6.9.7.1. Formation Position Change--Any Aircraft Moves to Lead:
            3.6.9.7.1.1. Step 1. Lead determines the aircraft to move forward (maneuvering
            aircraft). The maneuvering aircraft will echelon (normally      right) using 30
            degrees of bank and turning 30 degrees off heading. When aircraft is 30 degrees
            off heading, reverse the turn using 30 degrees of bank and return to formation
            heading. This provides approximately 2 NM offset.
            3.6.9.7.1.2. Step 2. After established in echelon, the maneuvering aircraft will
            accelerate forward, increasing airspeed 30 KIAS maximum. The maneuvering
            aircraft should resume formation airspeed and stabilize approximately 1¼ NM
            forward from the original lead. When the maneuvering aircraft is in the forward
            echelon and positive visual and/or radar contact is established, conduct the
            required altitude changes. Note: altitude changes may be accomplished in
12                                                                AFI11-2B-2V3 3 MAY 2010


            Stabilized aft echelon position so long as all trailing aircraft maintain visual
            and/or radar contact with the preceding aircraft.
            3.6.9.7.1.3. Step 3. The maneuvering aircraft will then assume lead position and
            clear the formation members to fall into trail position.
            3.6.9.7.1.4. Step 4. The formation lead should be advised by the last aircraft after
            the formation is reformed.
         3.6.9.7.2. Formation Position Change--Any Aircraft to the End of the Formation:
            3.6.9.7.2.1. Step 1. Lead determines the aircraft to move aft (maneuvering
            aircraft). The maneuvering aircraft will echelon (normally right) using 30 degrees
            of bank and turning 30 degrees from the formation heading. After turning 30
            degrees off heading, reverse the turn using 30 degrees of bank and return to
            formation heading. This will provide approximately 2 NM of offset.
            3.6.9.7.2.2. Step 2. After establishing in echelon, the maneuvering aircraft will
            decelerate toward the end of the formation, decreasing airspeed 30 KIAS
            maximum. The maneuvering aircraft should resume formation airspeed and
            stabilize approximately ¾ NM aft of the last aircraft. When the maneuvering
            aircraft is in the aft echelon position and positive visual and/or radar contact is
            established, formation lead directs required altitude changes. Note: Altitude
            changes may be accomplished in a stabilized forward echelon position so long as
            all trailing aircraft maintain visual and/or radar contact with the preceding aircraft.
            3.6.9.7.2.3. Step 3. The maneuvering aircraft will then move into trail position
            using no more than 15 degree heading corrections.
            3.6.9.7.2.4. Step 4. The formation lead should be advised by the last aircraft after
            the formation is reformed.
  3.6.10. Formation Deconfliction.
     3.6.10.1. General. FL will brief deconfliction contracts and ensure that all wingmen
     understand their responsibilities. Wingmen have the primary responsibility for safe
     separation and are responsible for executing the FL contracts.
     3.6.10.2. Loss of visual/radar lock. Use the following procedures if any flight member
     loses visual/radar contact within the formation:
         3.6.10.2.1. Wingmen will call “blind/broke lock” when unable to monitor preceding
         aircraft’s position.
         3.6.10.2.2. After a blind/broke lock call from any formation member, lead
         immediately will communicate current heading and altitude and then repeat heading
         and altitude parameters every 1000 feet until all formation members are tied or visual.
         3.6.10.2.3. If there is not a timely acknowledgement of the original “blind/broke
         lock” call, then the flight member initiating the call will maneuver away from the last
         known position of the other flight members and obtain a separate clearance.
     3.6.10.3. Broke Lock and Lost Comm. If a wingman becomes "broke lock" and is
     unable to contact the lead aircraft, the wingman will utilize all available communications
AFI11-2B-2V3 3 MAY 2010                                                                          13


       devices on board the B-2 to establish contact with lead. Simultaneously, the wingman
       must take positive steps to ensure separation. If in straight and level flight, maintain
       established altitude separation and previously cleared flight path. If straight ahead and in
       a climb or descent, turn fifteen degrees away from lead’s last known heading. If in a turn
       and in a climb or descent, roll out to obtain separation and ensure flight path clearance. If
       all attempts to regain contact with lead aircraft fail, attempt to contact ATC to obtain a
       separate clearance.
       3.6.10.4. Mid-mission/late rejoins. Rejoining aircraft require radio contact, visual or
       radar contact, and 1000 feet altitude separation before rejoining any formation. If
       applicable, accept “military assumes responsibility for separation of aircraft” (MARSA)
       with ATC only after ensuring altitude separation.
   3.6.11. Formation air refueling.
       3.6.11.1. Initial Rejoin. Cross the rendezvous point in trail formation. If IMC, lead
       directs wingmen to move to echelon after the formation is rolled out behind the tanker(s).
       If VMC and pre-briefed by FL, wingman may automatically assume echelon position
       with the tanker(s) in sight.
       3.6.11.2. Post refueling rejoins. After completing air refueling, lead moves to a two mile
       left 60 degree echelon position stacked down 2000 feet from the air refueling base
       altitude of the lead tanker. After completing refueling, the number two aircraft stacks
       down 1500 feet, and assumes a trail position behind lead. Post refueling, number three
       stacks down 1000 feet and moves to a trail position behind two. Lead will coordinate
       with the tanker lead for a larger altitude block, if required.
       3.6.11.3. Comply with further formation air refueling procedures IAW ATTP-56(B).
3.7. Air Refueling.
   3.7.1. Air refueling operations are authorized along published routes/tracks. Random air
   refueling is authorized with ARTCC approval. After completing the rendezvous, maintain
   formation with the tanker. The tanker is responsible for navigation.
   3.7.2. Air Refueling Restrictions.
       3.7.2.1. Do not conduct air refueling with control stick steering engaged.
       3.7.2.2. Do not conduct air refueling with an FCS CAUTION, except when necessary for
       safe recovery of the aircraft.
       3.7.2.3. Do not conduct air refueling when encountering turbulence which, in the opinion
       of the pilot-in-command or boom operator, denies a safe margin of control of either
       aircraft or boom.
       3.7.2.4. Do not conduct air refueling with less than four engines operating, except when
       necessary for safe recovery of the aircraft. Simulated engine out air refueling is permitted
       under IP supervision. Pilots will place no more than one throttle to idle to simulate the
       loss of one engine.
       3.7.2.5. Do not conduct air refueling when the tanker has less than all engines operating,
       unless required for safe recovery of the aircraft.
 14                                                              AFI11-2B-2V3 3 MAY 2010


      3.7.2.6. Do not conduct air refueling when any flight control problems are suspected or
      encountered in flight which, in the opinion of the receiver aircraft commander, would
      deny a safe margin of control.
      3.7.2.7. Do not conduct air refueling when tanker aircraft is unable to retract landing
      gear.
      3.7.2.8. Discontinue air refueling after loss of all tanker disconnect capability, except
      during the following conditions:
          3.7.2.8.1. During an emergency fuel situation (limit contact time to that required to
          obtain fuel).
          3.7.2.8.2. Operational missions, ORI, emergency evacuations or deployments/re-
          deployments (limit contact time to that required to obtain fuel).
      3.7.2.9. Boom wet downs from the contact position with JP-4 (Emergency/Alternate
      fuel) are acceptable as long as the total quantity passed does not exceed one percent of
      total fuel in tanks.
   3.7.3. Breakaway Training.
      3.7.3.1. The tanker pilot, boom operator, and receiver pilot will brief breakaway training
      prior to initiation. The briefing must include when the maneuver will occur and who
      gives the execution command.
      3.7.3.2. Do not accomplish breakaway training while in contact.
   3.7.4. Boom Limits Demonstration.
      3.7.4.1. Boom envelope demonstrations require IP supervision.
      3.7.4.2. The boom operator and the receiver pilot will confirm normal disconnect
      capability prior to the start of the demonstration.
      3.7.4.3. The receiver pilot will inform the boom operator when starting the
      demonstration, the limit demonstrated, and when terminating the demonstration.
   3.7.5. Override Boom Latching Procedures. Override boom latching procedures training
   require an instructor pilot. Pilots and boom operators will pre-brief procedures. Both tanker
   and receiver systems must be fully operational.
3.8. Approaches and Landings.
   3.8.1. Maximum bank angle in the traffic pattern is 45 degrees.
   3.8.2. Landing touchdown zone. The normal touchdown zone for full stop and touch and go
   landings is 750 -2500 feet beyond the threshold on runway centerline. Pilots should consider
   a go-around for landings outside the normal touchdown zone.
   3.8.3. Autopilot. When flying coupled instrument approaches, disengage the autopilot no
   lower than decision height or minimum descent altitude.
   3.8.4. Landings beyond approach end cables will be accomplished with at least 10,000 feet
   runway remaining plus 1000 feet of overrun. When 1000 feet of overrun are not available,
   reserve 1000 feet of the runway to satisfy the minimum overrun requirements.

3.9. Airshow/Flyby Profiles. The following are approved airshow/flyby profiles:
   3.9.1. Profile 1--Straight Thru Pass. Profile consists of a 1000 foot AGL (minimum altitude),
   clean configuration pass over the runway at 200 to 250 knots based on aircraft gross weight.
   If the show line is a non-runway environment then use 1000 feet above the highest obstacle
   within 2000 feet. Following the straight thru pass, aircraft will climbout IAW ATC
   instructions. If a high angle climbout is desired, this profile may be combined with the
   climbout portion of Profile 2.
   3.9.2. Profile 2--Tear Drop Pass. Profile begins via a straight run-in down the show line of
   the viewing audience at 200 to 250 knots, based on aircraft gross weight. Minimum altitude
   for this maneuver is 1000 feet AGL. If the show line is a non-runway environment then use
   1000 feet above the highest obstacle within 2000 feet. Upon completion of the straight run-
   in pass, track outbound approximately 1 nautical mile then execute a 240 degree turn away
   from the show line (rolling out momentarily at 90 degrees to the show line for clearing) so as
   to roll out directed towards show center tracking 30 degrees off runway or show centerline.
   At show center accomplish a turn away from show center and track outbound 30 degrees off
   runway or show centerline. All bank angles will be planned for 40 degrees (not to exceed 45
   degrees).Execute turns so as to fly no closer than 1000 feet from the crowd line. If departing
   after this profile, at show center, execute a climbing turn (at MCT) at 40 degrees of bank
   away from the crowd line. Comply with climbout in accordance with ATC instructions.
   3.9.3. Profile 3--360 degree (box pattern). Profile consists of a 1000 foot AGL (minimum
   altitude), clean configuration pass over the runway at 200 to 250 knots based on aircraft gross
   weight. If the show line is a non-runway environment then use 1000 feet above the highest
   obstacle within 2000 feet. Following the straight thru pass, execute a turn away from the
   crowd line and fly a rectangular box pattern to a second pass at 1000 feet AGL (roll out
   momentarily at perpendicular headings to the show line for clearing). All bank angles will be
   planned for 40 (not to exceed 45) degrees. At this time the aircraft will execute a level pass
   and depart the area.
3.10. Chase Formation.
   3.10.1. The OG/CC determines when a B-2 flight requires a chase flight.
   3.10.2. Minimum chase spacing from a B-2 is 150 feet.
   3.10.3. Chase aircraft will not fly directly over or under B-2 aircraft.
   3.10.4. All aircraft in the chase formation will use a common UHF frequency.
3.11. Reduced Lighting Training. Conduct reduced lighting training only in approved
airspace.
3.12. After Landing Procedures.
   3.12.1. Weapons bay doors. Do not open the weapons bay doors until the aircraft reaches its
   final parking location and a ground observer is available.
   3.12.2. Fuel distribution and center of gravity. To allow APU refueling, manually adjust
   fuel so that each main tank fuel quantity is below 18,000#s, each inboard tank fuel quantity is
   below 19,400#s, and each outboard tank fuel quantity is below 14,300#s. Accomplish fuel
   adjustments after exiting the runway and prior to engine shutdown. Maintain CG within the
AFI11-2B-2V3 3 MAY 2010                                                                       17


   flight CG envelope during taxi. To avoid fuel venting overboard, ensure the outboard tanks
   are below 14,300#s prior to engine shutdown following any preflight or alert cocking.
   3.12.3. Unless maintenance requests otherwise, close aux air doors and open the ARSSI
   prior to engine shutdown.
   3.12.4. Pilots will complete a post-flight walk-around inspection of the aircraft and weapons
   bays.
3.13. Hot Pit Refueling (HPR).
   3.13.1. HPR certified pilots and ground crews may conduct HPR day or night.
   3.13.2. HPR with a pentagraph requires a separate brake check area away from the refueling
   pits. HPR with R-11 or R-12A trucks does not require a separate brake check area.
   3.13.3. Outgoing ERCC crews normally perform HPR. Do not ERCC adjacent to aircraft
   conducting HPR operations.
   3.13.4. Do not conduct HPR if brake temperatures exceed 700 degrees Fahrenheit. After
   brakes cool to below 700 degrees, HPR is permitted.
   3.13.5. Pilots will monitor aircraft CG during HPR because with the ground refuel panel
   powered, the FMMS does not monitor CG. The fuel panel fuel management switch position
   (AUTO or MAN) will not prevent exceeding CG limits.
   3.13.6. Pilots will verbally confirm to the maintenance crew that hands, feet and knees are
   clear of all flight controls prior to commencing HPR.
   3.13.7. Do not perform any avionics operations or maintenance operations during HPR.
   Only transmit UHF/VHF if required for an emergency. Pilots will notify ground refueling
   crews prior to any radio transmissions.
   3.13.8. Do not HPR with weapons, live or inert, aboard the aircraft.
   3.13.9. Do not HPR if fuel was dumped during flight or if fuel is in the surge tank.
3.14. Fuel minimums.
   3.14.1. Normal fuel for recovery is 18,000 lbs.
   3.14.2. Minimum fuel is 15,000 lbs.
   3.14.3. Emergency fuel is 10,000 lbs.
   3.14.4. Remote or island destination (IAW AFI 11-202v3 AFGSC Sup) fuel reserve is
   30,000 lbs. If the remote or island destination requires an alternate due to weather, then the
   fuel reserve must include enough fuel for two hours of holding.

                               INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. Approach Category. The B-2A is designated as an approach category D aircraft. If the
airspeed for a circling approach exceeds 166 knots, use category E minima.
4.2. Simulated Instrument Flight Procedures.
   4.2.1. Synthetic ILS (SILS) and Synthetic TACAN (STACAN) approaches require VMC.
   Visual glide path guidance is required at night.
4.3. Flight in Precipitation/Icing Procedures.
   4.3.1. Lightning Strike/Static Discharge. In the event of a known or suspected lightning
   strike or static discharge, terminate the mission and maintain below 250 KCAS when
   practical.
   4.3.2. Avoid thunderstorms laterally by 20 NM when below FL 200.
   4.3.3. Avoid thunderstorms laterally by 40 NM when at or above FL 200.
   4.3.4. When at or above FL 200, stay VMC when within 40 NM of any convective activity,
   not just thunderstorms, which have built above FL 200.
   4.3.5. Avoid cruising at altitudes in IMC, or in areas of precipitation, that are within +/-5000
   feet or +/- 10 degrees Celsius of the forecast freezing level. Climb or descend through these
   areas as rapidly as is safely possible.
   4.3.6. Do not climb or descend through forecast or reported icing conditions greater than
   light.
   4.3.7. Do not cruise in any forecast or actual icing conditions.
   4.3.8. Maintain Mach .65 or greater to minimize amount of ice accumulated (in icing
   conditions).
   4.3.9. Minimize throttle movements with anti-ice/rain removal operating
4.4. INS/GPS/RVSM Flight.
   4.4.1. RNAV and GPS approaches are not authorized.
   4.4.2. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM is
   applied is considered special qualification airspace. Both the aircrew and the specific aircraft
   must be approved for operations in these areas. All B-2As are approved for restricted
   operation within RVSM airspace as documented in Figure 4.1 B-2A RVSM Envelope
   Limitations. Refer to FLIP GP and the following guidance for additional RVSM
   requirements:
   4.4.3. Required RVSM Equipment. Both altimeters (MDUs, one display before each pilot,
   and the standby altimeter), the autopilot altitude hold function, the IFF transponder altitude
   reporting (Mode C), and the flight control system (to include the air data ports and their
   heaters) must be fully operational (defined as not more than single channel failed) before
   entry into RVSM airspace. Should any failures of this equipment beyond the allowable single
AFI11-2B-2V3 3 MAY 2010                                                                    19


   channel failure occur, immediately notify ATC and coordinate further clearance. If failure
   occurs before entering RVSM airspace, request a new clearance so as to avoid this airspace,
   or request ATC special handling as a non-equipped aircraft.
      4.4.3.1. Autopilot. The altitude hold function of the autopilot shall be engaged
      throughout level cruise periods in RVSM airspace, except when special circumstances
      dictate, such as when turbulence procedures require disengagement. Report any aircraft
      deviations greater than 130 ft from the commanded altitude to maintenance.
      4.4.3.2. Altimeters. Crosscheck primary altitude displays with standby altimeter, before
      or immediately upon entry to RVSM airspace. After final level off in RVSM airspace the
      PIC will ensure that the readings of all altimeters are recorded (AVTR of both VSD’s)
      and retained for use in case of deviation.
   4.4.4. RVSM Operations. Monitor systems and crosscheck altimeters on primary displays to
   ensure they agree +/- 10 ft.
      4.4.4.1. Aircrews should limit climb and descent rates to a maximum of 1,000 feet per
      minute when operating in RVSM airspace to reduce potential effects on other aircraft’s
      Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) operations, and to minimize risk
      of overshooting desired altitude during level-off.
   4.4.5. Post Flight. Document (in the AFTO Forms 781) malfunctions or failures of RVSM
   required equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RVSM tolerances.

                                          Chapter 6

                     AIR-TO-SURFACE WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

6.1. References. AFI 11-214 contains air-to-surface procedures applicable to all aircraft. This
chapter specifies procedures applicable to B-2 operations.
6.2. General.
   6.2.1. Do not release weapons if a release system, indicator, or weapon bay door malfunction
   exists, unless the malfunction is only a loss of redundancy which does not affect weapons
   accuracy or normal weapons release (e.g., single power drive unit controller failure).
   6.2.2. Do not conduct simulated bomb runs, unusual maneuvers, or touch and go landings
   while carrying weapons.
   6.2.3. Do not complete weapon unlock/release enable/release consent for live or inert
   weapons until the aircraft is on the range, cleared HOT by the controlling authority, and
   weapons impact would be in the range danger area.
   6.2.4. Do not release weapons during an inflight emergency or with an engine shutdown
   (excluding combat).
   6.2.5. Do not release weapons if the release exceeds or will result in exceeding technical
   order limits, CG limits, briefed track/timing tolerances, safe escape requirements, wingman
   deconfliction, or fragmentation deconfliction.
   6.2.6. Do not open weapon bay doors during flight with weapons on board other than for
   intentional release, jettison, or telemetry checks (if applicable).
   6.2.7. A range control officer (RCO), chase aircraft, or the B-2 Mission Management System
   (MMS) may confirm releases. Pilots may conduct simulated bombing training after they
   release all live/inert weapons.
   6.2.8. If communications are lost while on-range, immediately place release switches to the
   safe/off position. Do not accomplish further releases until establishing communications and
   receiving clearance to release. If communications cannot be established, the pilots will
   remain in range airspace and attempt to contact the appropriate ARTCC by all means
   possible. If communications cannot be established, then proceed IAW range procedures.
   6.2.9. Do not operate in SIM mode when live or inert weapons are aboard the aircraft.
   6.2.10. Do not practice simulated emergency procedures when weapons are loaded on the
   aircraft.
6.3. Off-Range Simulated Weapons Employment.
   6.3.1. Pilots will minimize use of weapons doors in-flight during simulated weapons
   employment. Open weapons bay doors only for specific IQT/CT training.
   6.3.2. Do not “manually” rotate RLAs in partial SIM without RLAs installed.
   6.3.3. When conducting nuclear training missions using the simulation mode, pilots may
   power off the simulated weapons and deselect the weapons display for departure. After
   completing all simulated weapons deliveries, pilots should safe any retained simulated
AFI11-2B-2V3 3 MAY 2010                                                                        23


   weapons using the appropriate weapons checklist. Following completion of this procedure,
   pilots may power off any remaining simulated weapons and deselect the weapons display.
6.4. Weather Minimums/IMC Weapons Deliveries. If range procedures permit, B-2 pilots
may release live or inert weapons in IMC.
   6.4.1. Unless further restricted by range guidance, B-2 aircrews will adhere to the following
   when conducting IMC operations or dropping through an undercast: With GPS FOM greater
   than or equal to 4 requires one OAP or target direct aiming on a 0.8 NM CM map. Without
   GPS and system buffers greater than 250’ requires one OAP within 5 minutes of release (or
   target direct aiming) on a 0.8 NM CM map. For Coordinate only releases: Do not release if
   GPS FOM greater than or equal to 4. For non-GPS integrated releases do not release if
   navigation system buffers are greater than or equal to 250. Buffer value must be verified via
   radar within 10 minutes of release.
6.5. Hung weapons procedures.
   6.5.1. General. If pilots receive hung munitions indications, they will terminate all
   subsequent bombing activity scheduled for the sortie, accomplish post release checklist
   actions to safe the weapons, and return to base.
   6.5.2. Recovery. If recovering with hung weapons, accomplish the abort/post-release
   checklist and return directly to base or other suitable landing base, avoiding over-flight of
   populated areas. Accomplish air refueling if necessary for aircraft recovery.
6.6. Jettison procedures. Pilots will jettison weapons only if in the opinion of the pilot in
command, the retention of stores would adversely affect the safe recovery of the aircraft. After a
successful jettison with suspected or known hung munitions, do not accomplish any further
weapons delivery activity (peacetime).
6.7. Exercise participation.
   6.7.1. B-2 crews may fly in penetration master mode during peacetime training missions that
   comply with current security directives.
   6.7.2. B-2 pilots will comply with all other training rules/SPINS including external lighting,
   IFF, squawks, and altitudes.
   6.7.3. The OG/CC may waive these restrictions IAW the appropriate classification guide.
 24                                                                AFI11-2B-2V3 3 MAY 2010


                                           Chapter 7

                          ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

7.1. General. This chapter contains procedures to be followed when other-than-normal
situations occur. They do not, however, replace or supersede procedures contained in the flight
manual.
   7.1.1. Accept no aircraft for flight with a malfunction which denies the crew the ability to
   safely operate in all phases of flight or any malfunction that, if airborne, would require
   mission termination.
   7.1.2. Once a malfunctioning system is isolated and/or the fault corrected, do not use that
   system again unless use in a degraded mode is essential for recovery. Do not conduct ground
   or in-flight troubleshooting after completing flight manual emergency procedures.
   7.1.3. Fuel dumping. Only conduct fuel dumping in order to reduce aircraft gross weight for
   safety of flight. When circumstances permit, dump over unpopulated areas above 8,000 feet
   AGL. Annotate fuel dumping in the AFTO Forms 781. If conditions permit, advise the
   appropriate air traffic control agency of altitude and location and when the operation has
   been completed.
   7.1.4. Brake and nosewheel steering malfunctions. Do not taxi the aircraft with a brake
   system malfunction. Do not taxi with a nose wheel steering malfunction with the exception
   of using nose wheel steering override, or differential braking to clear the active runway. After
   clearing the runway, the pilots will stop until the malfunction can be cleared. If nosewheel
   failure occurs in-flight and cannot be cleared or reset, aircrews may taxi the aircraft clear of
   the runway using NWS Override or differential braking and stop until the malfunction can be
   cleared.
7.2. Ground Aborts. Delayed aircraft may join a flight at a briefed rendezvous point or fly a
briefed alternate mission. Flight leads will advise the appropriate agencies of applicable changes
after a ground abort.
7.3. Takeoff Aborts.
   7.3.1. When a takeoff is aborted and hot brakes are suspected or computed, taxi to the hot
   brake area, declare an emergency, and follow technical order procedures. Crews will
   reference the B-2 Brake Energy Limit Chart in TO 1B-2A-1 and comply with local guidance.
   7.3.2. Pilots will recalculate takeoff data and brake energy data prior to follow-on takeoffs
   after an abort.
7.4. Air Aborts. Local guidance such as the B-2 Go/No Go Guide dictates specific causes for
mission abort.
   7.4.1. Abort missions for any of the following:
       7.4.1.1. Bird strike/FOD.
       7.4.1.2. Over-G.
       7.4.1.3. Flight control system anomalies (see local guidance).
AFI11-2B-2V3 3 MAY 2010                                                                      25


       7.4.1.4. Engine flameout/stagnation.
       7.4.1.5. Boom strike.
       7.4.1.6. Confirmed or suspected fuel leaks.
   7.4.2. Do not conduct training events such as air refueling (except when required for safe
   recovery of the aircraft), live/inert bombing, dissimilar air training activity, or practice
   patterns/landings, after an air abort.
7.5. Radio/IFF-SIF Failure. Comply with local procedures for radio failure. Immediately
notify controlling agencies if the IFF is inoperative, and provide accurate position reports for
separation from other traffic.
7.6. Lost Wingman Procedures. During climbs and descents, if visual and/or radar contact is
lost, flight leads will use all means to ensure proper formation spacing (lateral and vertical).
Wingmen immediately will call blind/broke lock when unable to monitor preceding aircraft’s
position. After a blind/broke lock call, lead will broadcast heading and altitude every 1000 ft
until all formation member are either tied or visual.
7.7. Spatial Disorientation (SD)/Unusual Attitudes.
   7.7.1. Practice unusual attitude recoveries are prohibited in flight.
   7.7.2. Nose High Recovery Procedure. To recover from a nose high attitude, add power as
   required, establish a bank angle of no more than 60 degrees, lower the nose to a minimum
   minus three degree pitch attitude, then return the aircraft to level flight in both pitch and
   bank.
   7.7.3. Nose Low Recovery Procedure. Recover from a nose low attitude by reducing power
   and extending speedbrakes as required, rolling wings level, then increasing stick back
   pressure to return the aircraft to level flight.
7.8. Armament System Malfunctions.
   7.8.1. After complying with technical order procedures and guidance, pilots will comply
   with local guidance.
   7.8.2. For peacetime missions, do not rotate a hung weapon from the release position.
   7.8.3. If an inadvertent release occurs, accomplish post release checklist actions to ensure
   switches are in the safe/off position. Do not accomplish any further weapons deliveries
   (actual or SIM). If no weapons remain on the aircraft, any non-weapons related training may
   be accomplished.
7.9. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures.
   7.9.1. A simulated emergency procedure is any procedure that produces an effect which
   closely parallels an actual emergency. Retarding a throttle to simulate the drag of a flamed
   out engine would be an example of such a practice.
       7.9.1.1. Do not practice aborted takeoffs except in a simulator.
       7.9.1.2. Do not shut down an engine in flight to simulate an emergency.
       7.9.1.3. Simulated engine out refueling with an engine in idle is permitted as part of
       syllabus training with an IP.
 26                                                                  AFI11-2B-2V3 3 MAY 2010


      7.9.1.4. Practice stalls and approach to stalls are prohibited inflight.
7.10. Search and Rescue Combat Air Patrol (SARCAP) Procedures. During an aircraft
mishap, immediately attempt to locate survivors and initiate rescue efforts.
   7.10.1. Knock off maneuvering and the prebriefed mission.
   7.10.2. Establish a SARCAP commander.
   7.10.3. Notify controlling agencies of the situation, and change squawk as required.
   7.10.4. Mark the last known position of survivors using any navigation means available.
   7.10.5. Remain above the highest ejection altitude.
   7.10.6. Deconflict with other aircraft to prevent mid-air collision.
   7.10.7. Revise BINGO fuels or recovery bases to maintain maximum SARCAP coverage.
   7.10.8. Relinquish SARCAP operations to designated rescue forces upon their arrival.
   7.10.9. Follow briefed or local procedures following the arrival of designated rescue forces.
AFI11-2B-2V3 3 MAY 2010                                                                         27

                           LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

8.1. General. This chapter is reserved for unit local operating procedures. IAW AFI 33-360,
the paragraph method is the only authorized way to supplement an AFI and added material must
be arranged according to the basic publication. Units composed of dissimilar aircraft may publish
guidance in a single, stand-alone local operating instruction instead of supplementing this AFI.
Added or stand-alone procedures will not be less restrictive than those contained elsewhere in
this volume. This chapter is not intended to be a single source document for procedures
contained in other directives or regulations. Avoid unnecessary repetition of guidance provided
in other established directives; however, reference to those directives is acceptable when it
serves to facilitate location of information necessary for local operating procedures. This chapter
is authorized to be issued to each B-2 pilot. Units may supplement the following paragraphs for
local operating guidance:
   8.1.1. Section A. Introduction/Purpose.
   8.1.2. Section B. Applicability.

  AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND
                 NUCLEAR THREAT ENVIRONMENT

A2.1. General Information. Potential use of CBRN weapons against friendly airfields presents
a serious threat to flying operations. Although the most effective way for aircrews to avoid this
threat is to be airborne before those weapons are detonated or dispersed and then land at a field
that has not been contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate from a field that has
come under CBRN attack. Each air base should publish detailed CBRN procedures. The
following information is for use when base-specific procedures are unknown or incomplete.
   A2.1.1. Counter-CBRN actions can be grouped into environments. First is where
   chemical or biological agents are dispersed from a munition or sprayed as an aerosol
   resulting in a cloud or rain of minute droplets. The nuclear environment is within range of
   any direct effect from a nuclear detonation. The radiological environment’s hazard is
   radioactive dust that can originate as fallout from a detonation or from dispersal of
   radioactive material without a nuclear detonation--a dirty bomb. Procedures in all
   environments except nuclear are similar--use procedures and protective gear to avoid skin
   contact with or inhalation/ingestion of agents or particles.
A2.2. Mission Preparation. Determine the CBRN status at planned launch, recovery and divert
bases. Know the current MOPP level for relevant sectors of the launch airfield. Plan ground ops
to minimize the time between leaving shelter and takeoff. If available, use other aircrew
members to perform preflight duties to minimize flight crew exposure. Arming and EOR
procedures may be conducted in the hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) or other non-standard
location.
A2.3. Travel To/From the Aircraft and Aircraft Preflight. Step in the appropriate protective
ensemble and carry other protective gear as required. If possible, travel to and from the aircraft
in an enclosed vehicle to prevent contamination from agents or dust settling from the air. If
travel on foot is unavoidable, choose a route that takes maximum advantage of available
overhead cover (sun shades, buildings, etc.). If the aircraft is contaminated, ensure maintenance
has accomplished spot decontamination and avoid contaminating your person during preflight.
Take steps to avoid bringing contamination into the aircraft on helmet bags, map bags, etc. In a
potential CBRN environment, keep aircraft buttoned up as much as possible when outside
protective shelter. Post-mission, if there is any suspicion of aircrew contamination process
through an aircrew contamination control area (ACCA).
A2.4. Ground Operations during Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent).
   A2.4.1. Before Taxi Out and After Taxi Back. If Alarm Red occurs while the crew is
   outside the aircraft or in the chocks, shut down and exit the aircraft (if appropriate), take
   cover and don appropriate MOPP. This may require use of the ground crew mask. A
   hardened facility such as a HAS provides optimum protection. Ensure the safety of
   supporting ground crew; use hand signals if necessary.
   A2.4.2. Ground Operations Outside the Parking Spot. Maintain contact with SOF, ATC,
   CP, etc. to remain aware of ground hazards and command direction. If Alarm Red occurs
   while on the ground outside the chocks, there are two primary options. First is to taxi into
AFI11-2B-2V3 3 MAY 2010                                                                            35


   structure, preferably a hardened one, although a hangar or flow through will reduce exposure
   to settling airborne agent. Use caution to not damage the aircraft or nearby people and
   things. Shut down and close structure doors when able. The second option is to launch for
   survival contingent on fuel state, arming status, proximity to runway, nature of attack, etc. If
   shelter or takeoff is not possible, try to get out of the taxi flow. In extremis, especially if you
   don’t have a protective mask available, select 100 percent oxygen and consider turning off
   the ECS and/or shutting down to avoid bringing agent/dust into the aircraft. Leave the
   aircraft buttoned up and await assistance.
A2.5. Airborne.
A2.5.1. Contamination. Becoming contaminated by chemical or biological agents, while
airborne, is very unlikely. If chemical agent contamination occurred prior to takeoff, flight will
dissipate the agent to some degree, but will not achieve complete decontamination. Flights of at
least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes.
Fly with the aircraft configured (gear and speedbrakes extended) as long as possible to maximize
the airflow in and around as many places as possible. There is no simple guidance for biological
contaminants. If suspected, maintain maximum protective posture. If radioactive dust
contamination is suspected, take measures to avoid getting the dust on bare skin, breathing it in
(protective masks work for this) or getting it into your mouth. Seek decontamination assistance
after landing.
A2.5.2. During the Mission and RTB. Use command and control agencies to maintain
awareness of command intent and the status of primary and alternate landing locations. Do not
attempt to land during Alarm Red situations unless there is no other option. Follow C2
directions and hold or divert. If holding, try to wait until Alarm Red is terminated. When able,
obtain updates on airfield status, ground hazards, dearm and taxi routing. If landing in Alarm
Black, expect a contaminated environment and MOPP 4. Droplet settling following a chem or
bio airburst attack can take up to one hour. If you believe the aircraft was contaminated before
takeoff or while airborne, notify C2.
