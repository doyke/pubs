space Medicine Squadron (6 AMDS) and Flight Medicine (SGPF) occupational health responsibilities.
Deletes recommendation for prompt retraining of personnel medically disqualified in their Air Force Spe-
cialty Codes. Deletes requirement for Family Practice (SGOPM). Replaces Air Force Occupational

1. Purpose. The Occupational Health Program is designed to prevent and control potential adverse
effects of the work environment on the worker. Successful accomplishment requires close teamwork
between the various sections of Aeromedical Services, the Aerospace Medicine Council, Unit Command-
ers, the Military Personnel Flight, and the Civilian Personnel Office, as well as supervisors and employees
working in every area on MacDill AFB.

2. Terms Explained.
   2.1. Hazardous noise exposure: Exposure to noise in the work environment exceeding the limits set
   by AFI 90-821.
2                                                      MACDILLAFBI48-103 16 NOVEMBER 2005


    2.2. Hazardous/toxic agents: Chemical, radiation, or biological agents that have the capability of
    adversely affecting the health of an exposed individual. Also included are physical agents/workplace
    situations with potential ergonomic effects.
    2.3. Occupational health examination: The term used to identify examinations performed under this
    program.
    2.4. Preplacement or baseline examination: An examination done prior to beginning work to estab-
    lish and document baseline data for future use. This includes a preplacement physical examination for
    selected jobs.
    2.5. Special purpose periodic examinations: Specific tests and examinations done at intervals to eval-
    uate and document the health effects of potential occupational exposures. The frequency and extent
    of these examinations are determined locally by the Aerospace Medicine Council after reviewing
    Bioenvironmental Engineering's assessment of the work environment.
    2.6. Audiometric examination: A "hearing test" using an electroacoustic instrument that measures an
    individual's hearing level at established frequencies of sound. Initial audiometric examinations are
    used as a reference to which subsequent examinations can be compared.
    2.7. Termination examination: An examination given when an employee changes jobs, separates, or
    retires.
    2.8. PIMR: Preventive Health Assessment/Individual Medical Readiness tracking program.
