SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

Changes were made to reflect guidance provided in AFI 31-218(I), Motor Vehicle Traffic
Supervision and AFMAN 31-116, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision. This document
now reflects the current terminology IAW the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) to include the use of the terms Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) and Breath
Alcohol Concentration (BrAC). This document includes the national BAC and BrAC level of
.08 percent as an intoxicated level when operating a motorized vehicle. Adds a BAC or BrAC
level standard of .01 or higher for persons under the age of 21 when the legal alcohol
consumption age is 21 or above. Adds Installation Commander, or their designee, must conduct
evidence reviews as soon as possible, or within the first normal duty-day following final
assembly of evidence. Requirements include that unit Commanders, following coordination with
SJA, direct drug testing within 24 hours of a suspected alcohol related incident and to refer
personnel to treatment programs IAW AFI 44-121, Alcohol and Drug Abuse Treatment
Program. Clearly states for Commanders not to provide limited or restricted driving privileges
to those individuals who have had their driving privileges suspended or revoked by a local, state,
or federal agency. It establishes the minimum traffic enforcement standards for FEW AFB.

        alcohol by volume when an arrest report or other official document reasonably shows an
        intoxicated driving incident occurred.
     2.3.2. Implied Consent to Breath, Blood or Urine Test. People who drive on FEW are
     deemed to have given consent to evidential tests for alcohol or other drug content of their
     breath, blood or urine when lawfully stopped, cited or apprehended for any offense allegedly
     committed while driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle to determine the influence
     of alcohol or drugs.
        2.3.2.1. Refusal or failure to successfully provide a breath, blood or urine sample will
        result in an automatic one year revocation of base driving privileges to run consecutively
        with any suspension period resulting from a DUI conviction.
        2.3.2.2. When Military refuse to submit to a test to determine BrAC for an on base DUI,
        90 SFS personnel will consult with the on call 90 MW/JAG and Military Magistrate to
        request search authority. If authority to search and seize is granted the offender may be
        transported to the 90 MDG for blood draw. 90 SFS Patrols shall provide the blood draw
        kit and are responsible for maintaining/documenting the chain of custody and
        transportation to the Wyoming Chemical Testing Program.
            2.3.2.2.1. When civilians refuse to submit to a test to determine BrAC for an on base
            DUI, 90 SFS personnel will consult with the on call 90 MW/SJA and Military
            Magistrate to determine a course of action.
        2.3.2.3. The Intoximeter EC/IR breath test accomplished by certified police personnel is
        the primary method for determining breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) at FEW.
90MWI31-218 11 JULY 2014                                                                             7

       2.3.3.1. These letters will be prepared by the 90 SFS/S5R and are valid until a final
       determination is made. The Installation Traffic Officer will conduct administrative
       hearings and release findings and recommendations. Failure of the offender to submit a
       request for an administrative hearing within 10 days from the date of receipt of the
       preliminary suspension/revocation letter will result in a waiver of such hearing. Any
       person whose driving privileges have been revoked or suspended shall surrender their AF
       Form 2293, U. S. Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator Identification Card, to 90 LRS
       Operators Registration & Licensing section. Personnel may not use a civilian license to
       drive GOVs off-base when on-base driving privileges have been suspended or revoked.
       2.3.3.2. 90 SFS/S5R will serve the letter by contacting the offender’s First Sergeant or
       unit Commander. The unit Commander or First Sergeant will direct the offender and their
       supervisor to 90 SFS/S5R to sign the letter within 3 duty days (unless TDY or in leave
       status). If a revocation for implied consent is combined with another revocation such as
       DUI, revocations will run consecutively.
   2.3.4. Appeal process for traffic citations:
       2.3.4.1. The appealing individual will submit an in-turn letter endorsed by their
       Commander to 90 SFS/S5R, 90 SFS/CC and the Installation Traffic Officer. This letter
       will include the date, time and location of the violation, as well as the citation number
       and justification for the appeal. 90 SFS/S5R will coordinate and add appropriate
       attachments (i.e., statements from issuing patrol/witnesses). 90 SFS/S5R and 90 SFS/CC
       will coordinate and make recommendations to the Installation Traffic Officer. The
       Installation Traffic Officer will make the final determination and forward the original
       letters to 90 SFS/S5R. 90 SFS/S5R will notify the individual of the final decision.
       2.3.4.2. The only appeal process for DD Form 1805 (civilians) is to make an appearance
       before the U. S. District Magistrate.
       2.3.4.3. For on base offenses, letters of preliminary suspension/revocation are maintained
       and issued by the on duty Security Forces Flight. All Preliminary Notice of
       Revocation/Suspension of Base Driving Privileges letters shall remain in effect until a
       final determination is made by the Installation Traffic Officer. For off-base offenses,
       violators will report to the 90 SFS/S5R section to be issued a preliminary

                                             Chapter 4

                                    TRAFFIC SUPERVISION

4.1. Installation Traffic Code. The Installation Traffic Code (ITC) is established in
Attachment 2 (A2) of this instruction. In addition, all Wyoming State Statutes (W.S.S.)
governing traffic are assimilated under Title 18 U.S.C. § 13, Assimilated Crimes Act, and will be
enforced on the installation. The W.S.S. listed in the ITC are not all inclusive; this is a list of the
most commonly referenced statutes. The US District Court sets the fines for those receiving DD
Form 1805 through the Collateral Fine Schedule.
4.2. Seatbelts. Any non-use of occupant protective devices shall be enforced as a primary
traffic violation. This authorizes installation patrols to make traffic stops based solely on the
failure of the operator or passengers to use available restraint system devices while moving per
DOD Instruction 6055.04, dated 23 January 2013. Personnel operating a motor vehicle, who are
found not wearing restraint systems in violation of AFI 31-218(I) and this instruction, will have
their base driving privileges suspended for the following timeframes:
   4.2.1. First violation: Base driving privileges suspended for 10 days.
   4.2.2. Second violation: Base driving privileges suspended for 30 days.
   4.2.3. Third violation: Base driving privileges suspended for 1 year.
4.3. Child Safety Restraint System. Per W.S.S. 31-5-1303(a), children who are under 9 years
of age must be properly secured in an approved child safety restraint system preferably in the
back row of seats of the vehicle. The only exceptions are if the vehicle only has one row of seats
or if all safety belts in the rows of seats behind the front seat are in use by other child passengers
in the vehicle. The child may then be properly secured in a child safety restraint system in the
front passenger seat of the vehicle. A rear-facing infant seat shall not be placed in front of an
active airbag.
4.4. Cell Phone Use/Texting. Vehicle operators on FEW, both POV and GOV, shall not use
cell phones or other hand-held electronic devices unless the vehicle is safely parked or unless
they are using a hands free-device.
4.5. Headphones and Earphones. The wearing of headphones and earphones is prohibited
while driving a motor vehicle on base. This does not negate wearing of hearing protection when
conditions and good judgment dictate its use such as when driving in noise hazard areas. This
restriction does not apply to intercom systems worn by motorcycle operators and their
passengers.
4.6. Music Inside Vehicles. No person operating a vehicle shall allow the volume of the
amplified sound to be heard for a distance of 50 feet from the source. Negative considerations
will be if the noise is raucous, offensive, jarring, or vibration is deemed and/or reported as a
nuisance or disturbance by a person(s) in the area of audibility.
4.7. Off-road vehicle use. All-Terrain Vehicles (ATV) which are registered off base as
privately owned vehicles are not authorized for use on FEW. ATVs utilized for mission needs
are authorized; however, these vehicles are not authorized for regular transportation on paved
roads. Brief excursions across paved roadways for mission requirements are authorized. All
90MWI31-218 11 JULY 2014                                                                       13


Operators of GOV ATV’s must comply with the PPE requirements listed in paragraph 3.4. of
this instruction.
4.8. Civilian Sponsored Speed Measuring/Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)
Courses. The objective of civilian or manufacturer sponsored courses is to improve the
effectiveness of speed enforcement through the proper and efficient use of speed-measurement
LIDAR. On successful completion, the course graduates must know how to:
   4.8.1. Describe the association between excessive speed, accidents, deaths, injuries and
   describe safety benefits of effective speed control.
   4.8.2. Describe the basic principles of LIDAR speed measurement.
   4.8.3. LIDAR operators are not required to show the speed displayed on the LIDAR unit to
   the vehicle operator stopped for a speed violation.
   4.8.4. Pacing will not be used by 90 SFS personnel to determine the speed of a targeted
   vehicle. Citations will not be issued in these cases. 90 SFS personnel must base their
   probable cause to write a citation for speeding on certified LIDAR units which have been
   calibrated IAW manufacturers’ specifications.
4.9. Traffic Investigations. Security Forces personnel will conduct detailed investigations of
major vehicle accidents. IAW AFMAN 31-116, paragraph 4.2.1., a major traffic accident is any
accident involving a fatality, injury or property damage above the amount of $10,000.
   4.9.1. Minor collisions are those that do not meet the major accident criteria. Drivers
   involved in any on-base minor vehicle accidents will report the accident immediately to
   BDOC.
   4.9.2. For major accidents involving active duty personnel off the installation, 90 SFS/S5R
   will request a copy of the report through the responsible police agency. The report will be
   forwarded to 90 MW/SE.
4.10. Parking. Parking is not authorized on any paved or dirt surface not clearly lined, marked
or otherwise designated for parking. If parked on the side of a roadway, vehicles must be parked
with the flow of traffic. Personnel residing in military housing may park along the curb unless in
a clearly marked snow route and it is already snowing, snow is forecast within the next 24 hours
or 90th Civil Engineering Squadron (CES) is already clearing roadways. During special events
(e.g. Commander’s call) temporary authorized roadside parking along selected streets will be
authorized.
   4.10.1. IAW AFMAN 31-116, Table 5.2., children under 12 will not be left in parked motor
   vehicles at any time without supervision of a responsible individual. Vehicles will not be left
   idling without a qualified driver in the vehicle. Pets will not be left unattended in motor
   vehicles for any length of time that would be hazardous to the pet’s health.
   4.10.2. No private automotive repairs will be performed on roadways or in parking lots
   within the confines of the installation. The only authorized locations are inside base housing
   area garages, the auto hobby shop or at the Express service station. Repairs made in the
   housing area or dormitories must be of minor maintenance activity (e.g., engine oil change,
   battery replacement, etc.) and hazardous materials must be disposed of properly. Any repair
   that renders the vehicle inoperative for a period exceeding 24 hours is unauthorized in all
   base housing areas/dormitories.

   4.10.3. 90 CES/CC is the approval authority for all reserved parking sign requests, including
   proposed signs that deviate from the guidance above. The building facility manager will
   request approval for desired parking spaces by submitting an AF Form 1768, Staff Summary
   Sheet, through 90 CES/CEO, 90 MW/SE, and 90 SFS/S5L for approval by 90 CES/CC. This
   request must include a legible diagram showing the location of the reserved parking. Once
   approved, submit an AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request. Each base facility
   will be allowed reserved parking for the following users:
       4.10.3.1. Wing and Vice Wing Commander (certain buildings only).
       4.10.3.2. One reserved space for each Group Commander and each Deputy Group
       Commander permanently occupying a facility.
       4.10.3.3. One reserved space for each Squadron Commander and each Deputy Squadron
Commander (or appropriate equivalent) permanently occupying a facility.
       4.10.3.4. One reserved space for each squadron First Sergeant permanently occupying a
       facility.
       4.10.3.5. Disabled parking space based on the Americans with Disabilities Act
       Accessibility Guideline.
   4.10.4. Officers, NCOs or civilian equivalents, may perform duties as a parking warden in
   parking areas under their Commander’s control. Parking wardens are authorized to issue
   tickets only for parking violations listed in the ITC. Commanders submit memorandums to
   90 SFS/CC appointing primary and alternate parking wardens that include appointee’s full
   name, rank, office symbol, and duty phone. Parking wardens receive training and ticket
   books from 90 SFS/S5L. Tickets will be forwarded to 90 SFS/S5R by the next duty day.

               DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS), is the
primary means of recording and tracking driving records on FEW. All records shall be kept on
accordance with AFI 31-203, SFMIS.
   5.1.1. If persons being transferred from FEW to a new installation have valid points or other
   entries on the driving records, 90 SFS/S5R will forward the driving records active duty
   military and family members to the gaining installation utilizing SFMIS.
5.2. Point System Application. The traffic point system provides a uniform administrative
device to impartially measure driving performance of FEW personnel. This point system is not a
disciplinary measure or a substitute for punitive action. The system is not intended to interfere in
any way with the reasonable exercise of the Installation Commander’s prerogative to issue,
suspend, revoke, deny or reinstate installation driving privileges.
   5.2.1. Reports of moving traffic violations recorded on DD Form 1408 will serve as a basis
   for determining point assessment. Table 5.2. indicates the number of points to asses per
   violation. If more than one violation appears on the DD Form 1408, the point total of all the
   violations will be assessed. Distribute citation copies and process point assessments IAW
   AFMAN 31-201, Volume 7, Security Forces Administration and Reports (SFAR/S5R).
   Include point totals when sending out citation notifications to unit Commanders and First
   Sergeants.
   5.2.2. Driving revocations/suspensions and corrective actions shall be issued for the
   following
       5.2.2.1. 12 points in a 12 month period: 1 year revocation
