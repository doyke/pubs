     level below the group commander in the fulltime staff for that group and notification of such
     designation forwarded to 908 AW/FMA. If no designee is authorized, the approval authority
     will be the 908 AW/CC in thier absence. See paragraph 1.5.2 for processing requirements for
     orders for ARTs performing active duty at home station.
     1.4.2. Multiple orders authorizing two or more consecutive days of active duty must be
     approved at the group commander level or higher. This approval must ensure the member has

     become apparent until after the first active duty period ended, the employee is under civilian
     control, and no other person was available to serve the second period of active duty. Appropriate
     documentation certifying this approval must be maintained in the six-part folder and available
     for review.
  1.5. Unit Responsibilities:
     1.5.1. All personnel responsible for tracking T&A records must appoint a primary and alternate
     timekeeper in writing. A copy of this appointment letter will be forwarded to 908 AW/FMA and
     the original maintained in the unit.
     1.5.2. Active duty utilization on non-duty days at home station by ARTs is authorized as long as
     they are required for mission purposes and duty can be construed to be primarily in the military
     duty areas of the technician. Copies of certified AF Form 938 and AF Form 40A documentation
     for ARTs on a scheduled civilian duty day, regardless of report time, will be included in the
     T&A folder for the appropriate pay period.

        1.5.2. Unit orders specialists will generate an e-mail containing orders for ARTs performing
        duty at home station which, upon approval by competent authority, will be forwarded to 908
        AW/FMA providing names and dates of duty. The e-mail will reflect the following statement:
“Orders requests for _____________(Name) performing duty at home station and require
advance approval by the Wing Commander, Maintenance Group Commander, Operations Group

particular group is limited to one level below the group commander in the full-time staff for that group
and notification of such designation forwarded to 908 AW/FMA. If no designee is authorized, the
approval authority will be the Wing Commander in the absence of the Group Commander.
     1.6. 908 AW/FMA and 908 AW/FMFP Responsibilities:
        1.6.1. The 908 AW/FMA office will no longer maintain a copy of each employee’s timecard for
        audit purposes. Originals maintained by the individual who input the timecard data will be used
        for timecard audits.
        1.6.2. The 908 AW/FMA office will maintain the original copy of all AF Forms 428 according
        to AFRIMS, T65-22, Rule 3.
        1.6.3. The 908 AW/FMFP office will ensure that the timekeeper certifies the AF Form 938
        according to paragraph 1.3.8. If blocks 47 and 48 are not completed, the order will be returned
        to the member or unit without action.
        1.6.4. The 908 AW/FMA office will ensure applicable group commander approval is
        documented prior to processing any orders within AROWS-R for ARTs performing active duty
        at home station. If the e-mail approving the duty performance is not present in the 908
        AW/FMA organizational mailbox and signed by the applicable authority at the time of
        certification, the order will be returned to the unit without action.
2. Compensatory Time Approval and Tracking. The supervisor will request in advance, document,
and track compensatory time. The following items are provided for clarification:
     2.1. Supervisors must ensure that the compensatory time cap is not exceeded and will be responsible
     for computing the maximum compensatory time for each GS-11 and above. Provide the appropriate
     timekeeper a copy of how this computation was made. Each timekeeper must have a copy of the
     individual’s compensatory time cap on file for reference in the T&A book. Supervisors will ensure
     that the compensatory time cap is recalculated when there is a change in the employee’s salary.
     2.2. Complete, coordinate, and approve the AF Form 428 prior to compensatory time being worked.
     In emergencies, obtain verbal approval by the approving authority, pending the processing of the AF
     Form 428. In such cases, include the following statement in the justification block of the AF Form
     428: “PRIOR APPROVAL OBTAINED FROM APPROVING AUTHORITY” and process no later
     than the following duty day.
     2.3. Supervisors of individuals earning compensatory time will sign as requester on the AF Form
     428. The OG/CC, MXG/CC or MSG/CC will approve requests for compensatory time off. Non-
     exempt employees (bargaining unit employees) may request compensatory time off in lieu of
908AWI65-101 14 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                                         5


   overtime pay. When this occurs, include the following statement in the remarks block and ensure
   that the statement is signed and dated by the employee:
“I request compensatory time be earned in lieu of overtime pay for hours indicated on this AF Form 428.
___________________ ________”
   2.4. The AF Form 428 requires a specific justification on it (use reverse side if necessary). In order
   to ensure an appropriate use of compensatory time/overtime, supervisors will review the work to be
   done prior to submitting the request.
   2.5. If the individual is required to work more hours than authorized on the original AF Form 428
   for that day, advance verbal or written authority should be obtained. Any variances over the original
   authorized amount will be made in pen and ink on the copy of the original approved AF Form 428.
   The approving authority must initial the changes on the copy.
   2.6. A copy of the modified AF Form 428 will be sent to the 908 AW/FMA office for filing with the
   original form. A copy should also be provided to the timekeeper for documenting the timecard. The
   employee will be initialing the hours performed on the timecard so their initials are not required on
   the changes to the AF Form 428.
3. Overtime Approval and Tracking. The general guidance outlined in paragraph 2 for the approval
and tracking of compensatory time is applicable for premium pay for overtime work with the following
differences:
   3.1. Approve overtime only when an absolute mission requirement exists. The supervisor will
   request overtime and justify it on an AF Form 428. Prior written approval must be obtained from the
   senior ART if 908 AW/CC is off station.
   3.2. A copy of the modified AF Form 428 will be sent to the 908 AW/FMA office for filing with the
   original form when applicable.
   3.3. 908 AW/FMA must certify funds availability before being sent to the approval authority.
   3.4. Submit a copy of the approved AF Form 428 with the timecard for input to DCPS.
   3.5. Overtime is not authorized for ART personnel on the same day that the individual is scheduled
   for UTA.
4. Absences.   The timekeeper will charge all absences, other than civilian TDY, as leave.
   4.1. Inactive Duty Training (IDT) Control. ARTs and non-ART civilian employees completing IDT
   during civilian duty hours and utilizing the AF Form 40A for documentation will process the form
   through their timekeeper before submission to the Unit Training Assembly Participation System
   (UTAPS). The only exception to this policy would be for transactions transferred through UTAPS
   Web. Unit POCs will coordinate with the timekeeper when duty performed is on a regularly
   scheduled civilian duty day. Hours of IDT performance must be included on AF Form 40a to audit
   against civilian duty hours.
       4.1.1. The timekeeper will initial adjacent to blocks 12 and 13 on the AF Form 40A. Do not
       certify the AF Form 40A until the timekeeper accomplishes their documentation.
   4.2. AFTP/AGTP Control. The AFTP Finance Pay Roster generated in the HQ AFRC AFTP
   System is used for accounting for payment of both AFTPs and AGTPs.
       4.2.1. The Operations Officer will appoint a verifier and alternate verifier in writing.
 6                                                              908AWI65-101 14 SEPTEMBER 2007


        4.2.2. The verifier will compare the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
        Document, with the Automated Mission Sign-In Form or the AGTP Log on a daily basis. The
        verifier must ensure that the duty period documentation for each AFTP reflects a minimum of
        four hours for a single AFTP and eight hours for a dual AFTP. The verifier’s signature will
        attest to this review process.
        4.2.3. AFTPs flown or AGTPs performed by ARTs or non-ART civilian employees during
        civilian duty hours must reflect the type of leave and hours taken on the Mission Sign-In Form or
        AGTP Log as applicable. ARTs and non-ART civilian employees will ensure their scheduled
        civilian duty hours are annotated in the civilian duty period block of the Mission Sign-In form or
        AGTP Log for each day when AFTPs are flown or AGTPs worked, excluding civilian Scheduled
        Day(s) Off (SDO). The verifier will ensure copies of the automated AFTP Finance Pay Roster
        are forwarded to the Wing Headquarters timekeeper for Wing assigned aircrew members who
        perform AFTPs or AGTPs during scheduled civilian duty days, regardless of report time.
        4.2.4. The Operations Timekeeper will crosscheck the T&A sheets against the automated pay
        roster and AGTP Log and place their initials in the designated block. Prior to certification and
        processing of the AFTP/AGTP Pay Roster, the Operations timekeeper will cross-check entries
        on the pay roster against T&A records to ensure proper accounting of leave status and sign the
        Timekeeper block of the pay roster prior to submitting to the Operations Officer for certification.
        4.2.5. The certifying official will ensure the flying time, duty time, and verifier’s signature is
        properly recorded.
     4.3. Active Duty and Inactive Duty Training Periods. All ARTs and Non-ART civilian employees
     performing active duty or inactive duty training that overlaps with their regularly scheduled duty
     hours must be in appropriate leave status. Employees may use military leave, annual leave,
     compensatory time, or leave without pay (LWOP) for periods of military duty. Copies of all
     certified military pay documents (AF Form 938/AF Form 40A) for any duty during the pay period
     must be provided to the timekeeper to be included in the Time and Attendance Records Folder.
     4.4. Military Leave. Military leave may be used for periods of active duty and inactive duty training.
     Under Public Law (PL) 106-554, Consolidated Appropriations Act 2001, employees using military
     leave may now charge military leave in one-hour increments and leave will not be charged for
     periods of non-duty. Employees may only use military leave for periods reflected on the military pay
     document that overlap with the civilian duty day.
5. Time and Attendance Audit Program
     5.1. The 908 AW Financial Analysis Officer is designated as the wing OPR for the quarterly Time
     & Attendance Audit Program. The wing OPR will provide an annual schedule to the group
     commanders for each quarterly audit. The plan will include the requested dates the audit team
     members will be required to perform the actual detail for the Wing OPR.
     5.2. Each group commander will designate two audit team representatives to perform the quarterly
     audits for the Wing OPR. One of the representatives must be the timecard input clerk from that

     5.3. Time and attendance audits for 25% of the assigned civilian and ART personnel will be
     accomplished on a quarterly basis. Timesheets will be audited against military pay reports to

     Compensatory/Overtime entered on the timesheet will be audited against AF Form 428, Request for
     Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay and compensatory Time, to ensure proper approval authority and
908AWI65-101 14 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                                            7


   number of hours recorded match those approved. Night differential pay will be reviewed to ensure
   appropriate work schedule changes are properly processed and documented. Hours reflected on the
   timesheet for Night Differential Pay will be compared to the hours listed on the DCPS History
   Printout to ensure employee receives the accurate pay. The Time and Attendance Audit Results
   Report will be provided to the 908 AW/CC not later than (NLT) than the last day of the month
   following the audited quarter. For example: 31 Oct for Jul thru Sep, 31 Jan for Oct thru Dec, 30 Apr
