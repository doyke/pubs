                                            Chapter 1

                                     RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Air Force History Office (AF/HO). Sets out guidance on United States Air Force (USAF)
organizational lineage, honors, and emblems (heraldry). Convenes board of review, if needed,
to confirm or change aerial victory credit awards.
1.2. Air Force Historical Research Agency. AFHRA is the Air Force’s central repository of
historical information. The Director (AFHRA/DR), working through the Organization Histories
Division (AFHRA/RSO), implements policies for and determines organizational lineage and
honors.     Consistent with the standards of The Institute of Heraldry (TIOH), AFHRA/DR
approves organizational emblems.           AFHRA/RSO also verifies unit honors, collects
organizational data, tabulates and reports heritage scores and related assessments, and prepares
the monthly consolidated Air Force Organization Status Change Report (AFOSCR).
Additionally, AFHRA confirms USAF aerial victory credit awards and publishes corrected lists
as needed. For other responsibilities of this agency, see AFMD 30, Air Force Historical
Research Agency.
1.3. History Offices at Major Command, Field Operating Agency (FOA), and Direct
Reporting Unit (DRU) Headquarters. History Offices will be the point of contact for all
heraldry proposals and will advise on the historical aspects of organizational actions affecting the
lineage and honors of establishments and units. Staffs at FOAs and DRUs without historians
will process heraldry proposals and consult on changes affecting organizational lineage directly
with AFHRA/RSO. History Offices will also work to ensure that AFHRA/RSO receives
documentation and orders concerning the award of aerial victory credits. History Offices will
work to collect and include in Command histories all special orders awarding unit honors, such
as the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award and the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award.
1.4. Air Force Field Historians. Historians must be knowledgeable of the contents of this
instruction and advise their commanders and staffs on its standards and procedures. They will
also help ensure AFHRA/RSO is provided documentation necessary to compile and maintain
accurate and complete lineage and honors data on their organizations and documentation needed
to confirm aerial victory credits.
1.5. Manpower, Organization and Resources Staffs at MAJCOMs, FOAs, HAF/HR, and
DRUs. Coordinate proposed organization actions affecting units and establishments with their
history offices. MAJCOMs and those Air Force FOAs and DRUs that publish their own
administrative orders on unit changes must submit the Air Force Organization Status Change
Report to AFHRA/RSO on the last day of each month (see Chapter 4) and ensure that
AFHRA/RSO is on distribution for all special orders and movement orders affecting
organization changes.
1.6. Organization Division, Directorate of Manpower, Organization and Resources
(AF/A1MO). Responsible for Air Force organizational guidance and changes. Coordinates
organizational change proposals affecting the lineage and honors of units and establishments
with the Office of the Air Force Historian. Sends copies of the final authorization instruments
to AFHRA/RSO.
AFI84-105 MARCH 2013                                                                              5


                                            Chapter 2

                      ORGANIZATIONAL LINEAGE AND HONORS

2.1. Lineage. Lineage is the unique, official, traceable record of organization actions peculiar to
each Air Force organization; therefore, it is the sole determinant of an organization’s rights to
history, honors, and emblems. It allows the Air Force to avoid confusing one organization with
another.
   2.1.1. A current organization may have begun its existence with a different number,
   designation, echelon, or all three, but lineage traces all changes to its current designation.
   2.1.2. Organizations may not use identical function, installation, transfer of personnel, or
   similarity of designation of other organizations to claim those organizational histories,
   awards, and emblems.      Such relationships to previous organizations and continuity of
   missions may be explained in history pamphlets, displays, and similar presentations.
   2.1.3. The lineages of permanent organizations are continuous. Neither inactivation nor
   disbandment terminates a permanent organization’s lineage or heraldry.
   2.1.4. There are two types of provisional organizations (traditional and expeditionary).
       2.1.4.1. The lineages of traditional provisional organizations (i.e., temporary
       organizations established for short-term purposes) terminate when the organization is
       inactivated. They cannot be revived.
       2.1.4.2. Permanent organizations that USAF/A1MO converts to provisional status and
       redesignates as expeditionary may revert to permanent status (see paragraph 2.2.2
       below).
   2.1.5. The history, honors, and emblem of one organization may not be permanently
   transferred to another except that honors earned by “supported” expeditionary organizations
   may be conferred on aligned major force provider permanent organizations (see paragraph
   2.2.1 below). Conferral allows honors earned by the supported expeditionary organization
   to be preserved and displayed by the major force provider permanent organization as its own.
   2.1.6. The AFHRA is authorized to determine official lineage and honors data for regular
   Air Force organizations and Air Force Reserve Command organizations but not for Air
   National Guard. The AFHRA compiles and issues lineage and honors histories on the
   activation of inactive organizations with previous records of active service (first priority) and
   when requested by an organization (second priority). The National Guard Bureau’s Air
   National Guard History Office (NGB/HO) is responsible for Air National Guard
   organizational histories and Air National Guard lineage and honors matters.
2.2. Expeditionary Provisional Organizations. All expeditionary organizations are by
definition provisional (see AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization). There are two types of
expeditionary provisional organizations (major force provided and rainbow).
   2.2.1. Major Force Provider. A Major Force Provider is an expeditionary unit that draws
   the preponderance of its forces or command element from a single active unit. This wartime
   or contingency organization uses the numerical unit designation of the unit providing the
   preponderance of forces (major force provider).
 6                                                                    AFI84-105 MARCH 2013


        2.2.1.1. Such an expeditionary unit corresponds to the active unit from which it derives
        the majority of its resources at the same echelon and carries its designation with the
        additional word “Expeditionary.” For example, if a lead organization (e.g., the 1st
        Fighter Wing) provides the deployed command element and/or the largest portion of the
        expeditionary organization, the expeditionary organization may be designated and
        activated with the same number and at the same organizational level (e.g., the 1st
        Expeditionary Fighter Wing).
        2.2.1.2. Such an expeditionary unit may temporarily borrow the lineage and honors
        history from the active unit from which it derives the majority of its resources, but it
        cannot claim its lineage. Despite the similarity in designation and personnel, the two
        organizations are not the same (see paragraph 2.1.2).
        2.2.1.3. Honors earned by this type of expeditionary organization may be conferred but
        only on its aligned permanent organization at the same organizational level. Honors may
        not be conferred to a higher echelon organization. For example, any honors earned by
        the 4th Expeditionary Civil Engineer Squadron would be conferred on the 4th Civil
        Engineer Squadron but not on the 4th Mission Support Group or 4th Fighter Wing.
           2.2.1.3.1. To accomplish conferral, the supported expeditionary organization’s
           activation order must state, “Upon inactivation, any awards or honors earned by
           (designation of provisional organization) are conferred on (designation of
           corresponding permanent organization).”
           2.2.1.3.2. Wings and groups should be considered on the same organizational level.
           Squadrons and flights should be considered on the same organizational level.
     2.2.2. Rainbow. An expeditionary organization formed from the resources of multiple
     permanent organizations. This wartime or contingency organization does not have an
     identifiable major force provider.
        2.2.2.1. Rainbow organizations are inactive historical units converted to provisional
        status and assigned to, and activated by MAJCOMs as expeditionary organizations (e.g.,
        the 332d Air Expeditionary Group, formerly the 332d Fighter Group). The MAJCOM
        may activate the expeditionary organization, usually in a forward location, for an
        indefinite time, and then inactivate it, so that it may later be activated again.
        2.2.2.2. The lineage of the rainbow expeditionary organization continues as if it were
        still a permanent unit; the expeditionary organization may claim and use all honors and
        history. Upon its reversion to permanent status, its lineage continues and any history and
        honors earned as a rainbow expeditionary organization remain with it; consequently,
        conferral of honors is unnecessary.
2.3. Temporary Bestowal of Honors and Emblems. To perpetuate the heritage of World War
II combat groups, the history, honors, and emblem of an individual group may be temporarily
bestowed upon an active combat wing. Although the wing may claim to be the group’s legitimate
successor, it may not claim lineal descent from the group.
     2.3.1. The wing must be numerically aligned with the group from which honors are
     bestowed, as confirmed by AFHRA on the basis of original Department of the Air Force
     (DAF) letters.
AFI84-105 MARCH 2013                                                                         7


   2.3.2. Temporary bestowal becomes effective on activation of the wing. The group must be
   inactive or active and assigned to the numerically aligned wing. The wing may borrow only
   history that accrued and honors that were earned during periods before the wing was first
   active.
   2.3.3. While temporary bestowal is in effect, the wing may display honors earned by the
   numerically aligned group. The wing may also adopt the emblem of its numerically aligned
   group, if the lineage of the group antedates that of the wing.
2.4. Heritage Standards. IAW AFPD 38-1, Organization and Unit Designations, when
making force structure changes, general Air Force policy is to keep active those organizations
with the most illustrious heritage. See AFPD 38-1 for information on the heritage standards and
procedures for squadrons, groups, and wings.
2.5. Organizational Terminology. In addition to the definitions in Attachment 1, see AFI 38-
101, Chapter 2 and 4, for guidance on organizational terminology.
 8                                                                     AFI84-105 MARCH 2013


                                             Chapter 3

                                   AIR FORCE HERALDRY

3.1. Purpose of Air Force Heraldry. Organizations need visible, enduring symbols in the form
of emblems to promote esprit de corps, morale, and a sense of heritage. Air Force heraldry
meets this need only as long as emblems are designed to uniform standards and are not readily
changed.
3.2. Eligibility for Official Emblems and Mottoes. Constituted organizations (establishments
and units) as defined in AFI 38-101 may have organizational emblems and mottoes, although
they are not mandatory. If a constituted organization uses or displays an emblem in any format
or manner, it must be an approved, official design registered with the AFHRA. A constituted
organization must also register its motto with AFHRA before using or displaying it.
     3.2.1. Examples of nonunits not entitled to organizational emblems are detachments, Air
     Force elements, operating locations, sections, functional divisions, and named activities.
     (See AFI 38-101).
     3.2.2. Air Force Recruiting Service subordinate components (groups and squadrons) cannot
     display unique emblems, but must use the emblem approved October 6, 1954, for the Air
     Force Recruiting Service.
     3.2.3. Provisional organizations may be authorized to have an official emblem.            The
     provisional organization’s type will determine its eligibility.
        3.2.3.1. A traditional provisional organization designated for non-expeditionary purposes
        is not authorized an official emblem.
        3.2.3.2. A major force provided “supported” expeditionary organization is not authorized
        its own emblem, but may use and display the officially approve an emblem of the major
        force provider organization from which it derives the majority of its resources.
        3.2.3.3. A rainbow provisional organization is authorized an official emblem. It will use
        the official emblem approved for it in permanent status or design and register a new
        emblem if one does not exist.
     3.2.4. Component Numbered Air Force. In addition to its official emblem, a numbered air
     force (NAF) functioning as a component numbered air force (C-NAF) under a unified
     command may design an additional emblem to reflect its component status or geographic
     area of responsibility. The registration of the official design with TIOH will be made directly
     in coordination with the AFHRA, which will retain copies of the official emblem files for
     reference.
        3.2.4.1. The C-NAF emblem will not replace the official NAF emblem, which will
        continue to display the traditional numbered air force designation (for example,
        Seventeenth Air Force) in the scroll below the shield.
        3.2.4.2. Both C-NAF and NAF emblems will comply with the standards pertaining to
        emblems listed in paragraph 3.7 in this AFI, except that C-NAF emblems (for example,
        Air Forces Africa) may depict specific geographical areas appropriate to their command
        area of responsibility (AOR). If the C-NAF opts to depict their AOR, this depiction,
AFI84-105 MARCH 2013                                                                                  9


       presumably a map, will not count against the three-element limit. Also, the wording in
       the scroll will be left to the discretion of the C-NAF commander provided the 36-
       character limit (including spaces) is not exceeded.
3.3. Standardized Heraldry for Establishments. Emblems of establishments,                        i.e.,
headquarters organizations, are displayed on shields. (See Table 3.1 and Figure 3.1).
   3.3.1. An establishment is a flag-bearing organization and displays its emblem on its flag
   (see definition of organizational flag in Attachment 1). A group may use a guidon instead
   of a flag at the discretion of the wingcommander (See AFI 34-1201, Protocol).
   3.3.2. Wing or independent group designations or motto (if any) are displayed in the scroll
   beneath the shield. The chosen scroll wording must be consistently depicted in all
   reproductions of the emblem. A wing or independent group without a motto must display its
   designation in the scroll.
   3.3.3. A group assigned to a like-numbered wing must use the wing’s emblem. Display the
   group's designation in the scroll below the shield. (See Figure 3.1). A group with a
   numerical designation differing from that of its parent wing may display its own authorized
   emblem. Display the group's designation or motto in the scroll below the shield.
   3.3.4. Except for wings and independent groups, always display the establishment's
   designation in the scroll below the shield.
   3.3.5. Designations or mottoes may not exceed 36 characters and spaces.
3.4. Standardized Heraldry for Units. Emblems of units (squadrons, flights, or comparable
unit) are displayed on discs. (See Table 3.1 and Figure 3.2).
   3.4.1. A unit with a motto must have two scrolls. Display the unit's motto on a scroll above
   the disc and the unit's designation in a scroll below the disc.
   3.4.2. If a unit has no motto, display the unit’s designation in a single scroll below the disc.
   3.4.3. Designations and mottoes for units may not exceed 30 characters and spaces;
   generally scrolls are 90, 120, or 150 degree arcs to accommodate these characters.
   3.4.4. Squadrons and flights use a guidon instead of a flag. Do not display organizational
   emblems on guidons. (See definition of guidon in Attachment 1) (See AFI 34-1201).
3.5. Use and Control of Organizational Emblems. An active organization has exclusive use
of its currently approved heraldic emblem. AFHRA is responsible for controlling the use of all
other emblems. Images of all organizational emblems are protected by Title 18, United States
Code, Section 704 and the Code of Federal Regulations (32 CFR, Part 507).
   3.5.1. The commander controls the use of the organization’s currently approved emblem.
   Commercial enterprises may use the symbol only with the commander’s permission and after
   they have entered into a license agreement with the Air Force Trademark Licensing Office,
   an office under the Air Force Public Affairs Agency. A license agreement is also required
   for commercial use of all symbols controlled by AFHRA.
   3.5.2. This instruction, other guidance cited in the references section, and the organization's
   commander determine proper use of the officially approved emblem.
 10                                                                   AFI84-105 MARCH 2013


   3.5.3. When an organization inactivates, it must include its heraldic file(s) with samples of
   patches and decals, as well as flags and guidons in its unit heritage box, as defined in AFI 84-
   103, USAF Heritage Program. The box is then sent to the National Museum of the United
   States Air Force (NMUSAF), Bldg 489, 1100 Spaatz Street, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH
   45433-7102.
   3.5.4. When an organization is scheduled to activate again, the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/HO
   should contact the NMUSAF to facilitate release of the unit heritage box for possible use of
   the flags or guidons at the activation ceremony.
   3.5.5. Submission to AFHRA of emblem requests for processing will not begin for an
   organization before issuance of its activation order. A copy of the order must be included as
   part of the emblem request package. The responsibility for initiating and funding an
   organizational emblem request rests with the organization commander.
3.6. Processing heraldry requests. (See Figure 3.3).
   3.6.1. Organization commanders submit requests by e-mail through Air Force History
   channels (wing/center historian and MAJCOM historian) for AFHRA final approval of
   heraldry actions involving emblems, mottoes, revised significance statements, or flag
   drawings. Note: MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/HO Offices may forward their command’s
   organizational emblem requests by mail to AFHRA/RSO, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell
   AFB AL 36112-6424.
       3.6.1.1. A request for an emblem or to modify an approved emblem must include the
       following:
          3.6.1.1.1. A letter signed by the organization commander explaining (or justifying)
          the requested action(s), including what is to appear in the scroll(s). (See sample at
          Attachment 2).
          3.6.1.1.2. For a new organization, or an organization activating again, a copy of the
          special order activating it. Contact MAJCOM/HO or equivalent history office for
          assistance if needed.
          3.6.1.1.3. A color representation of the design proposal in .jpg or other suitable
          electronic format rendered in accordance with standard Air Force Heraldry (see
          paragraphs 3.3 or 3.4, and 3.7). The scroll(s) need not be filled in. In lieu of
          submitting a design proposal, the organization may instead request TIOH design
          assistance in the development of sketch options for the commander’s review and
          acceptance based on mission and functional statements (to be included with the
          request letter).
          3.6.1.1.4. A statement of significance of the elements and colors in the design
          proposal.
          3.6.1.1.5. DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR),
          payable to TIOH, the official executive agency for all Department of Defense

              historian on current costs.
AFI84-105 MARCH 2013                                                                       11


            3.6.1.1.5.2. Include on the MIPR a point of contact (including e-mail address, fax
            number, and unit address) to receive the resulting DD Form448-2 (Acceptance
            Form).
            3.6.1.1.5.3. The MIPR must accompany the emblem package for coordination
            through the organizational historian, major command historian and the AFHRA
            (do not send MIPR directly to TIOH).
     3.6.1.2. The unit correspondence forwarding the proposal must name a point of
     contact(name, phone number, e-mail address and fax number) authorized to approve
     minor changes during emblem processing.
     3.6.1.3. Wing or Center/HOs must review emblem requests for compliance with this AFI
     and endorse subordinate organizations' submissions. MAJCOM/DRU/FOA/HOs must
     likewise review and endorse subordinate organizations' proposals and indicate as such in
     a formal cover letter or e-mail for official submission to AFHRA.
         3.6.1.3.1. Emblem proposal packages should be devoid of extraneous materials (i.e.,
         duplicate copies of the design proposal, internal command staff summary sheets,
         unit’s lineage and honors history, etc.).
         3.6.1.3.2. When submitted by e-mail to AFHRA, enter a clear title in the subject of
         the message, e.g., Emblem Request Package for 1 Fighter Wing.
         3.6.1.3.3. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/HOs should request electronic delivery or read
         receipt confirmation on all e-mail sent to the AFHRA which contain official emblem
         submission requests.
     3.6.1.4. Air National Guard organizations coordinate heraldic actions through Air
     National Guard History Office (NGB/HO).
  3.6.2. AFHRA does the following:
     3.6.2.1. Notifies the MAJCOM/HO or equivalent history office when it receives the
     proposal. (See paragraph 3.6.1.3.3).
     3.6.2.2. Reviews and evaluates the proposal for completeness, accuracy, and conformity
     with this AFI.
     3.6.2.3. Submits it to TIOH for registration and artwork, including the line art drawing,
     color codes and significance statement, embroidery manufacturing drawing (if ordered),
     finished computer graphic rendition, and (for an establishment) flag drawing.
     3.6.2.4. Approves final emblem design from TIOH.
     3.6.2.5. E -mails to MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU history office to distribute as needed to
     units a digital color copy of the emblem, the approval letter, finished line drawing,
     subdued color rendition, description, including significance, color codes, and
     manufacturer drawing (if ordered).
     3.6.2.6. Mails to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU history office to distribute as needed to
     subordinate units the copies of the large flag drawing (for an establishment).
  3.6.3. Organizations must receive the officially TIOH registered and AFHRA approved
  emblem package before arranging acquisition of patches, signs, decals, award plaques, or
12                                                                 AFI84-105 MARCH 2013


  other emblem facsimiles. Organizations should obtain patches only from certified vendors to
  ensure quality reproduction. Request of a patch prototype for review prior to large quantity
  reproduction is encouraged.
  3.6.4. Changes in Mission. Mission modifications are accommodated by revising the
  significance statement for the organization’s approved emblem. A revised significance
  statement and a request letter signed by the organization commander should be coordinated
  through the Wing, Center, and MAJCOM/FOA/DRU history channel to AFHRA.
  3.6.5. Changes in Designations or Mottoes. Redesignations and motto changes are
  accommodated by revising the scroll(s). To reflect new designations or mottoes:
     3.6.5.1. Every establishment must submit a request and MIPR for a new flag drawing in
     accordance with paragraph 3.6.1
     3.6.5.2. Squadrons and flights may change scrolls locally. A color graphics file (.jpg or
     other suitable electronic format) of emblem with revised scroll(s) and letter signed by the
     organization commander should be coordinated through the Wing, Center, and MAJCOM
     or equivalent history channel to AFHRA for inclusion in the unit’s official emblem file.
  3.6.6. Do not revise or replace an approved emblem that meets current standards
  (reorganizations, redesignations, mission modifications, changes in weapons systems,
  changes in station, and other such changes, do not justify changing an approved emblem).
  AFHRA may approve changes to an approved emblem under the following conditions:
     3.6.6.1. The emblem violates the standards defined in paragraph 3.7 of this AFI. A unit
     with an approved emblem that falls into this category may have the emblem modified to
     meet the current heraldic standards.
         3.6.6.1.1. To maintain the lineage and tradition of the organization, design elements
         and colors should be preserved as closely as possible to the previous emblem; no new
         design elements or colors should be introduced.
         3.6.6.1.2. If a requested change involves an emblem reviewed and approved by the
         Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF), the request must be endorsed by the
         MAJCOM/HO and the MAJCOM/CC (or vice commander) before submission to
         AFHRA. New factors or information not available during the CSAF’s 1991-1994
         heraldry review may justify a change.
     3.6.6.2. An organization that has had more than one emblem in the course of its history
     may return to its first emblem (i.e., its historical emblem).
         3.6.6.2.1. Return to the historical emblem must be endorsed by the MAJCOM/HO
         and the MAJCOM/CC (or vice commander).
         3.6.6.2.2. Do not change elements of the historical emblem except to comply with
         paragraph 3.7.5 below.
         3.6.6.2.3. Place the historical emblem within the parameters of a shield (see
         paragraph 3.3) or disc (see paragraph 3.4), as appropriate.
AFI84-105 MARCH 2013                                                                           13


3.7. Heraldic Standards.
   3.7.1. Emblem designs and mottoes must reflect favorably on the United States Air Force; be
   original, distinctive, dignified, and in good taste; and be non-controversial.
   3.7.2. Organizations without an approved emblem may submit their own design proposal or
   request design assistance from TIOH. (See paragraph 3.6.1.1.3.1). Organizations desiring
   an emblem or that wish to inquire about an approved emblem, and parent organizations of
   units scheduled to be activated, should consult their Wing, Center, or MAJCOM history
   office. Seeking assistance early will help avoid delays.
   3.7.3. Follow these design element instructions, keeping in mind the purpose of Air Force
   heraldry as stated in paragraph 3.1:
      3.7.3.1. Use accepted heraldic symbols or stylized elements.
      3.7.3.2. Keep emblem design uncluttered and as simple as possible. A simple, clean
      design is much easier to reproduce as a patch, letterhead, or other rendition.
      3.7.3.3. All symbols and elements must be placed within the parameters of the disc or
      shield.
      3.7.3.4. Do not exceed three elements (see definition of element in Attachment 1).
      3.7.3.5. Do not duplicate the Air Force symbol, existing emblems, occupational badges
      (or other types of badges), or depict flag symbols of any kind (includes bunting). Support
      organizations may incorporate into their own emblems one element common to their
      parent organization.
      3.7.3.6. Do not include symbols or caricatures associated with foreign nations, extremist
      groups, games of chance, or a specific geographical location (if a globe element depicts
      landmasses, the landmasses must be unrecognizable unless North America is prominently
      displayed at center; a globe element may not depict both gridlines and landmasses).
      3.7.3.7. Do not depict numbers (exception: NAF emblems), letters, words, codes,
      symbols of a morbid nature, gambling devices, cartoon-like characters, assigned aircraft,
      or specific equipment.
      3.7.3.8. Do not violate trademark or copyright laws.
      3.7.3.9. Do not include very small detail features and accent lines which would be
      difficult to reproduce or embroider on small emblem reproductions.
      3.7.3.10. Face horizontal elements to the bearer’s right side (dexter), which in heraldry is
      the position of honor. (See Figures 3.1 and 3.2).
   3.7.4. A motto should be a simple phrase of meaningful words reflecting the vision or
   heritage of the organization. A unit may adopt a nickname as a motto, if in good taste.
      3.7.4.1. Do not use functional words that repeat the organization's designation, e.g.,
      “communication” or “comm.” in motto of a communications squadron.
      3.7.4.2. Do not use punctuation such as dashes, dots, commas, explanation marks or
      quotation marks in the motto. Apostrophes for possessive words are permitted.
      3.7.4.3. Do not use acronyms, abbreviations, or numerals.
14                                                                   AFI84-105 MARCH 2013


     3.7.4.4. Mottoes in English are preferred, but if in a foreign language, provide an English
     translation. The originating organization is solely and completely responsible for the
     accuracy of the translation.
  3.7.5. Follow these instructions about colors:
     3.7.5.1. Do not use metallic colors, glitz, highlights, dilution, shading, or other special
     effects.
  3.7.5.2. Do not use more than six colors; black and white count as colors.
     3.7.5.3. Use the official Air Force colors: ultramarine/reflex blue and Air Force yellow.
     3.7.5.4. Establishments use Air Force yellow on the border of a shield to contrast with
     the ultramarine/reflex blue background of organizational flags.
     3.7.5.5. For an establishment's scroll, use a white field (background), edged in Air Force
     yellow, with ultramarine/reflex blue lettering (satisfies requirement of paragraph
     3.7.5.3).
     3.7.5.6. For a unit's scroll, use any color so long as the overall design has six or fewer
     colors and the border of the disc and scroll are the same color as the letters on the scroll.
  3.7.6. Public Law 85-263, approved September 1957, 71 Stat. 589, directs that the Secretary
  of the Army will furnish heraldic services to all military departments and other branches of
  the federal government. TIOH, Fort Belvoir, VA is responsible for standardizing heraldic
  designs for correct sizes, colors, manufacturing needs, and refinement of all design elements.
  Accordingly, all emblem artwork and drawings must be obtained from TIOH, as directed by
  this AFI. Local procurement of heraldry artwork and drawings is not authorized.
  3.7.7. The Air Force Uniform Board advises on the subduing of emblems. TIOH follows that
  guidance in the subdued colors provided in the final emblem package. (See also paragraph
  3.7.8 below).
  3.7.8. When ordering guidons, flags, or patches, follow current AF guidance provided by the
  Air Force Clothing and Textile Office (AFCTO). AFCTO is the office of primary
  responsibility for specifications and technical details on the manufacture and procurement of
  emblems for wear as uniform patches and for organizational flags and unit guidons.
  3.7.9. The CSAF periodically reviews organizational heraldry for compliance with
  standards. Requests for exceptions to the standards outlined in this AFI should be staffed
  through the MAJCOM/CC to the CSAF office.
  3.7.10. For additional guidance on emblem submission, designs, and colors, consult The
  Guide to Air Force Heraldry at http://www.afhra.af.mil or contact your Wing, Center, or
  MAJCOM history offices.

        AIR FORCE ORGANIZATION STATUS CHANGE REPORT (AFOSCR)

4.1. Preparation.
   4.1.1. The Manpower, Organization and Resources Staff at each MAJCOM, and those FOAs
   and DRUs that publish their own administrative orders pertaining to unit changes, prepares
   the AFOSCR and submits it electronically to AFHRA/RSO on the last day of each month.
   Because this report has the C-1 priority designation, continue reporting during emergency
   conditions. Note: In the absence of e-mail capability, send the AFOSCR to AFHRA/RSO,
   600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424.
   4.1.2. AFHRA/RSO enters incoming AFOSCRS into a database to produce a consolidated
   monthly report available online to MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU manpower, organization and
   resources directorates.
4.2. Format. The AFOSCR shows each change in unit status affecting units and their
detachments, provisional units and their detachments, and named activities. Prepare as shown in
Attachment 3 and Attachment 4 with appropriate security classification.
   4.2.1. List changes in unit status for activations, inactivations, designations, redesignations,
   assignments, and station changes of units or detachments. Don’t list the inactivation or

                                          Chapter 5

   CONFIRMATION AND PUBLICATION OF USAF AERIAL VICTORY CREDITS
                             (AVC)

5.1. Authority for Confirming USAF AVC Awards. The AFHRA confirms awards of USAF
AVCs from authoritative sources. (See Attachment 5 for examples of documents supporting the
award of AVCs).
   5.1.1. The following documents will be considered authority for validating the award of a
   USAF AVC:
      5.1.1.1. An official order awarding credit.
      5.1.1.2. A victory credit board report from the time showing award of a credit.
   5.1.2. Mention of an AVC in unit histories may be used to buttress other sources but is not
   sufficient to verify an award.
   5.1.3. Removal of an aerial victory credit from an official list may be made only if there is
   overwhelming evidence of an error in the original confirmation and only if that evidence is
   reviewed and confirmed by a board as outlined below in paragraph 5.3.2
5.2. Validation Procedures. All claims of AVC awards should be forwarded to AFHRA/RSO.
When AFHRA receives a claim, a historian will:
   5.2.1. Research the latest official listing of AVCs to determine if there is a difference
   between the claim and the record.
   5.2.2. Search the files of past AVC claims to determine if necessary research has already
   been accomplished.
   5.2.3. Check any previous official aerial victory credit listings published by the Air Force
   Historical Research Agency or its predecessors that might mention the individual in question.
   5.2.4. Search the AVC sources and notes maintained at AFHRA.
   5.2.5. Search as needed histories of the individual's squadron and group or wing and the
   supporting documents for any mention of an AVC award.
   5.2.6. Contact, if further documentary proof is needed, other repositories, particularly the
   National Archives and Records Administration, the Library of Congress, and the Pentagon
   Library.
5.3. Revising the Official AVC Lists. If research uncovers sufficient evidence to add or
change the official AVC lists, the AFHRA historian will summarize the evidence, with
supporting documentation. Normally, the Chief, Organization Histories Division
(AFHRA/RSO), and the Director (AFHRA/DR) will review the evidence and authorize the
addition or change to the AVC list.
   5.3.1. For particularly controversial cases, AFHRA/DR may ask the Director, Air Force
   History and Museums Policies and Programs, to call a board of review to consider the
   evidence and make a ruling.
AFI84-105 MARCH 2013                                                                         21


      5.3.1.1. The board of review should consist of a representative from the AFHRA who is
      familiar with the case, at least one rated officer familiar with air combat, and other
      individuals determined by the Director, Air Force History and Museums Policies and
      Programs, to be essential to an impartial, informed decision.
   5.3.2. In instances where evidence seems to indicate the removal of an AVC, because of an
   error in the original confirmation process, the decision to remove must be made by a board of
   review appointed by AFHRA/DR or, if appropriate, AF/HO.
   5.3.3. If the claimant is not satisfied with the determination of the AFHRA or the Director,
   Air Force History and Museums Policies and Programs board of review, he or she may
   appeal to the Air Force Board for the Correction of Military Records.
5.4. Publication of AVC Lists. The Air Force Historical Research Agency publishes official
lists of AVCs, updating them periodically, as needed.
   5.4.1. In instances of recent combat with aerial encounters resulting in the award of new
   AVCs, AFHRA may publish only the date of the victory, the victor’s aircraft type, the type
   aircraft shot down, and the victor’s unit. The name of the individual awarded the AVC may
   not be published until ten years following the date of the AVC.
      5.4.1.1. In certain cases, for example when the name of the victor has already been
      published in open sources, AFHRA may publish the name of the victor in less than ten
      years.
      5.4.1.2. Each victor may give permission to publish his or her name in the AVC lists in
      less than ten years.
   5.4.2. Publication may be on the AFHRA Homepage and by the Air Force History and
   Museum Program.
   5.4.3. AFHRA publishes the only officially confirmed lists of USAF aerial victory credits.
   Where privately published lists differ from the USAF lists published on the AFHRA
   Homepage, the USAF lists should be taken as authoritative.

Terms
Aerial Victory Credits Lists—The officially confirmed lists of aerial victory credits.
Information in the lists consists of some or all of the following: Name of the person awarded the
credit, his rank, unit, service, serial number (before it became a social
security number), number of credits, date, position (pilot, observer, etc.), enemy aircraft type,
order number, and identification of the war.
Air Force Colors—Air Force yellow signifies the excellence required of Air Force personnel;
Air Force (ultramarine/reflex) blue signifies the sky as the primary theater for Air Force
operations.
Air Force Organizations—Establishments and units (see AFI 38-101).
Air Reserve Components—All units, organizations, and members of the Air National Guard
and the Air Force Reserve Command.
 24                                                                     AFI84-105 MARCH 2013


Air Staff—Offices in HQ USAF below the Secretariat level (under and including the Chief of
Staff, USAF).
Bestowal of Honors—In 1954, to perpetuate the histories and honors of the World War II
combat groups, an ad hoc committee recommended to the Air Force that the histories and honors
of the combat groups be bestowed upon the similarly designated combat wings. Although
contrary to a longstanding policy against transferring history and honors from one organization
to another, the Department of the Air Force bestowed on each combat wing the history and
honors of its similarly designated combat group.
Conferred—Honors that a provisional organization has earned and that the associated
permanent organization may claim and display as its own.
Constituted—Describes an organization that has been given an official name, or number and
name, and placed on the Air Force List to be activated.
Detachment—Part of a unit that is separated geographically from its parent unit and that is not a
unit for organizational purposes.
Disc—Shape on which the heraldic devices, symbols, or elements of a unit emblem are displayed
(see Figure 3.2). The disc of today originated with a roundel, which consisted of a white five-
pointed star in a blue circle, with a red disc in the center of the star. The roundel was displayed
unofficially on early USA Signal Corps airplanes, adopted officially in 1917 for airplanes, and
later evolved into the national star and bar aircraft marking of today. The US Air Force adopted
the disc in the early 1950s as the official shape for squadron emblems.
Element—In emblem design, a symbol or group of symbols, that is commonly accepted as one
object or system, such as a caduceus or small constellation, portraying a single characteristic,
trait, or concept.
Emblem—An officially approved symbolic design portraying the distinctive history, mission,
and general function of an organization. It is an important, abiding element of the organization’s
heritage.
Establishment—Any organization with a constituted headquarters, at group level or higher.
Expeditionary—A provisional unit or establishment specially designated for an operational
deployment, either independently or as part of a task force.
Flag Drawing—A blueprint of the organizational flag, with the lettering for the motto or
establishment designation correctly placed on the scroll. The manufacturer of the organizational
flag must have a flag drawing from the organization, even if the only change is in the lettering on
the scroll.
Functional Image—Any unofficial or nonunit design symbol locally designed and displayed.
These are often referred to as logos, morale or Friday patches. In no case should the historian
become involved in the design of such images or provide approval of their use and display. An
organization that uses a functional image in place of an approved organizational emblem violates
paragraph 3.2 of this AFI.
Guidon—A pennant used by an organization on ceremonial occasions, primarily by squadrons
and flights. Guidons are ultramarine blue wool and nylon, nylon, or polyester bunting, swallow-
tailed, 1 foot 8 inches tall by 2 feet 3 inches wide to end of the swallowtail, and forked 10 inches.
AFI84-105 MARCH 2013                                                                               25


The Air Force yellow American Eagle design appears on the front of the guidon and on the
reverse side as if printed through. Above the design is the designation of the parent unit; below
it is the designation of the organization. The organization may use authorized abbreviations.
When the number of the organization and the parent organization are the same, the lower line
indicates only the alphabetical portion of the subordinate organization designation. Numerals
and lettering are yellow, from 1 3/4 to 3-1/2 inches tall, and in varying widths. Lettering and
numerals appear on both sides of the guidon, reading from left to right on both sides.
Heraldry—The emblem, motto, designation, scroll(s), and shield (of an establishment) or disc
(of a unit).
Heritage—Those traditions embodied in the history, lineage, honors, and heraldry of an
organization.
Honors—Official recognition documenting an organization’s participation in combat or
meritorious achievement. They appear as service, campaign, Armed Forces Expeditionary, and
decoration streamers affixed to the organizational flag of an establishment or to the guidon of a
unit. Order flags, guidons, and streamers through official supply channels.
Lineage—The unique, official, traceable record of organizational actions peculiar to each Air
Force organization and to no other organization.
Lineage & Honors History—A statement that identifies the lineage, accrued honors,
assignments, stations, and emblem of an organization. It may include a list of commanders and
a list of aircraft, missiles, or both. If the organization is an establishment, the lineage and honors
history may also identify component organizations. Lineage and honors histories for combat or
support organizations that participated in significant Air Force operations may also contain
narrative summaries of operations.
Logos—See definition for “Functional Images,” above.
Major Force Provider—A permanent organization that contributes most of the personnel and
resources to a supported expeditionary organization.
Morale Patch—See definition for “Functional Images,” above. Morale patches (or Friday
patches) are not authorized for wear in accordance with AFI 36-2903, paragraph 3.2.1.6.
Motto—Part of the heraldry of an organization.         It expresses in a word or short phrase the
organization’s goals, ideals, or principles.
Nonunit—As defined in AFI 38-101, organizational entities that are neither establishments nor
units. Within an organization, a staff section is a nonunit. A "headquarters squadron section,"
despite the words "headquarters" and "squadron" in its name, is neither; it is a staff section.
Detachments, functional and alpha flights, operating locations, named activities, and Air Force
elements are all nonunits.
Organizational Flag—The organizational flag is authorized only for an organization with a
headquarters, i.e. an establishment. The official designation must include the word
“Headquarters,” for example, “Headquarters, 1st Wing.” The flag is rayon or synthetic substitute
material, ultramarine blue field, 3 feet by 4 feet, trimmed on three edges with a fringe of yellow
rayon 2 ½ inches wide. The shield contains the approved, official organizational emblem.
Overseas—All locations, including Alaska and Hawaii, outside the continental United States.
 26                                                                   AFI84-105 MARCH 2013


Patch—An informal term used to refer to the cloth depiction of an emblem (either in full color
or subdued for camouflage) that can be affixed to a uniform. Governed by AFI 36-2903.
Permanent Organization—A permanent organization is constituted by a War Department or
USAF letter; HQ USAF retains control of organizational actions of activation, inactivation, and
redesignation. The term also applies to a non-constituted organization created by a MAJCOM,
but over which HQ USAF has taken control of organizational actions applying to it. When a
permanent organization is inactivated or disbanded, it may be activated again, thus continuing its
lineage and retaining all accrued history and honors.
Provisional Organization—An organization with a finite existence created, usually, by a
MAJCOM, DRU, or FOA for a temporary purpose. When inactivated a provisional organization
ceases to exist, losing its lineage, accrued history, and honors (exception: see “Rainbow” below).
Rainbow—A long-term expeditionary organization with personnel and other resources drawn
from a multitude of permanent units. It is a permanent organization converted temporarily to a
provisional status that can only be accomplished by AF/A1MO.
Shield—Shape on which the heraldic devices, symbols, or elements of an establishment’s
emblem are displayed (see Figure 3.1). This shape derives from the shield displayed on the Air
Force Seal, which the Department of the Air Force adopted in 1947. The Air Force requires
establishments to use this type shield to display their distinctive emblems on organizational flags
and emblems. Patches for uniforms using this shield shape were phased in during late 1940s and
early 1950s as the US Army Air Forces shield was phased out.
Supported—A short-lived expeditionary organization with most personnel and other resources
drawn from a single permanent organization, known as the major force provider.
Unit—An Air Force organization with no headquarters, such as a named or numbered squadron
or flight.
