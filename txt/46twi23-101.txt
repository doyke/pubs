This instruction establishes responsibilities and procedures for ordering, backordering, and
tracking parts with Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) and the Enterprise Solution-
Supply (ES-S). It applies to all personnel assigned to the 46 TW and to all agencies involved
with maintenance on aircraft/equipment maintained by the 46 TW on Eglin AFB, to include
TDY locations that utilize IMDS (Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) will
use PMEL Automated Management System (PAMS).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Updated references to AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management, to include
AFMC Sup 1 and deleted references to AFMCI 21-119, Objective Center/Test Wing Aircraft
Maintenance Management Policy. This instruction establishes time guidelines for processing
Two-Level Maintenance (2LM) reparable assets.
1. Maintenance Supply Liaison (MSL) Responsibilities.
   1.1. The 46 TW Maintenance Supply Liaison (MSL) is responsible for ensuring Supply
   Support Units (SSUs) and maintenance repair shops comply with this instruction.
   1.2. The MSL will:
       1.2.1. Serve as the supply liaison between 46 TW and 96 LRS.
       1.2.2. Attend the 96th Logistics Readiness Squadron (96 LRS) Quarterly Customer
       Forum meetings to provide feedback on customer support and address any supply support
       issues.
 2                                                                 46TWI23-101 16 MARCH 2011


        1.2.3. Provide guidance on maintaining bench stock, forward supply points, repair cycle
        management, and due-in-from-maintenance (DIFM) management.
        1.2.4. Conduct semi-annual surveillance inspections on maintenance materiel control
        processes to include the precious metal program.
2. Supply Support Units. The 46th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (46 AMXS) SSUs and
maintenance repair shop managers will be thoroughly familiar with processes and
responsibilities involved with ordering and tracking parts as summarized below.
     2.1. SSUs and maintenance repair shops will:
        2.1.1. Receive and process parts requests from maintenance technicians/specialists.
            2.1.1.1. Maintain AF Form 2413, Supply Control Log; AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-In
            Request, or a locally developed computer log (i.e., automated log in PAMS),
            recording all parts ordered from 96 LRS; verify status with the Daily Document
            Register (D04), Priority Monitor Report (D18), and the Monthly Due-out Validation
            Listing (M30) or use printouts of requests made via the supply interface in lieu of AF
            Form 2413 and AF Form 2005.
            2.1.1.2. Verify and monitor backordered requests to prevent unwarranted mission-
            limiting conditions, cannibalizations (CANNs), priority abuses, or wasted money.
            Note: IMDS printouts may be used instead of AF Form 2413 and AF Form 2005 with
            flight chief approval. Locally developed logs must contain, as a minimum, all
            entries/columns found on AF Form 2413 and flight chief approval. Complete all
            columns on forms.
            2.1.1.3. File completed AF Form 2413 and AF Form 2005 in accordance with
            AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and dispose of in accordance with
            AFRIMS.
        2.1.2. Deliver reparable asset to the appropriate repair shop. Prompt processing is
        paramount for asset replenishment. Use direct Not Reparable This Station (NRTS) list
        for assets directly processed through 96 LRS Flight Service Center (FSC). Ensure all
        entries on AFTO Form 350, Reparable Item Processing Tag, are completely filled in
        IAW TO 00-20-2, Chapter 8, and accompany all property before forwarding to the repair
        shop or the Base Supply FSC.
        2.1.3. Manage and maintain 46 AMXS Support Section bench stock IAW AFI 21-101
        and AFMAN 23-110, Vol II; Part 2, Chap 25, and Part 13 to include AFMC and AAC
        supplements.
        2.1.4. Manage and maintain applicable reports and listings (including the D04, D18,
        D19, D23, M30, M04, Q13, S04, R31, R35, etc.). Ensure date, time, printed name and
        signature of individual validating each report or listing is annotated. Paperless efforts
        are highly encouraged; however, proof of validation is still required. Verify and monitor
        backordered requests to prevent unwarranted, mission-limiting conditions, CANNs,
        priority abuses, and wasted money.
        2.1.5. Establish a storage area for reusable containers.
46TWI23-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                       3


         2.1.5.1. Maintain an inventory list of containers in stock number sequence and all
         base agencies that may utilize reusable containers (supply, operations, and
         transportation).
         2.1.5.2. Consolidate work centers as authorized. Designate container locations.
         2.1.5.3. Conduct a monthly review of containers.
         2.1.5.4. Upon receipt of a serviceable part from Base Supply, check the D23 for
         location of unserviceable property. Contact location and forward container, if
         necessary.
     2.1.6. Annually, coordinate with the 46th Maintenance Squadron (46 MXS) backshops,
     the Air Force Repair Enhancement Program (AFREP), and MSL on candidates for direct
     NRTS list. The MSL will consolidate all inputs and forward for inclusion in the master
     direct NRTS listing.
     2.1.7. Maintain a current list of personnel authorized to receive classified components.
     2.1.8. Validate items requiring functional check, calibration, or operational programming
     flight prior to use; review and update annually. SSUs will coordinate with 46 AMXS.
     Forward the functional check list to the MSL; MSL will then forward the list to the 96
     LRS Materiel Management Flight.
     2.1.9. Locate easily accessible and visible EOQ/XB3 pickup point containers in or near
     each maintenance work center to encourage turn-in of unneeded items. Containers will
     be sorted into three categories; serviceable, unserviceable and scrap. All items will be
     tagged accordingly for identification and serviceability. Inspect the containers on a
     weekly basis for unauthorized items and contact the MSL or Base Supply personnel to
     schedule a pickup date/time.
     2.1.10. CANN procedures can be found in 46 MXG OI 21-122, Control of
     Cannibalization.
     2.1.11. Perform follow-up action with MSL to resolve supply-related issues.
  2.2. SSUs will:
     2.2.1. Manage and maintain the 46 AMXS Support Section aircraft tail number bins
     (TNBs) and items removed to facilitate other maintenance (FOM) IAW AFI 21-101,
     paragraph 11.24. If at all possible do not store aircraft panels one on top of the other.
     Store panels in vertical position with protective padding or a rubber mated type of
     material underneath. This storage practice will assist in prevention of potential scratches,
     dents, tears in panel material, etc. The importance of this storage practice is to ensure the
     original shape, form, design and function of panel is not compromised. It is imperative
     that all aircraft parts stored in TNB/FOM storage maintain their functional integrity and
     have the ability to be used for original intended purpose.
     2.2.2. Participate in aircraft document reviews. Validate parts requirements using
     inquire by serial number function. Ensure mark-for and delivery destination data are
     correct on all due-outs.
  2.3. The maintenance repair shops will:
 4                                                               46TWI23-101 16 MARCH 2011


        2.3.1. Repair, determine NRTS, or condemn the asset. Use AF Form 2520, Repair Cycle
        Control Log, or DD Form 1348-1, DoD Single Line Item Release/Receipt Document and
        DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document, to record all due-in from
        maintenance (DIFM) information and ensure signature of recipient.
        2.3.2. Schedule and control all repair cycle assets through repair flights based on priority.
        See TO 00-20-3 for further instructions. Use AFTO Form 350 or IMDS Screen 380 to
        control work; regardless of which method is used, supply status must be current and
        accurate.
            2.3.2.1. Establish a file in priority sequence with three sections when using AFTO
            Form 350: In Work (INW), Awaiting Maintenance (AWM), and Awaiting Parts
            (AWP).
            2.3.2.2. All work orders will be prioritized on IMDS Screen 380 by scheduling dates
            and times.
        2.3.3. Use AF Form 2520 or DD Form 1348-1/1A to record all turn-ins.
        2.3.4. Flights or elements that cannibalize aircraft parts will establish shop-level internal
        procedures for controlling cross-cannibalization of reparable assets to reduce AWP end
        units (see paragraph 3.1.10).
3. Requirements Processing.
     3.1. Prior to ordering, the SSU technician or specialist will verify Urgency of Need
     Designator (UND) A, B, or C requests. Ensure the proper Urgency Justification Code (UJC),
     priority designator, and Standard Reporting Designator (SRD) is mission-capable (MICAP)
     reportable and correct. Check applicable TO data, research accuracy of part number, and
     validate for possible suitable substitutes.
        3.1.1. All MICAP processing requires Production Superintendent (Pro Super)/flight chief
        approval.
        3.1.2. Backorders require Pro Super/element chief approval, except routine backorders.
     3.2. Maintain AF Form 2413 and AF Form 2005; recording all parts ordered from 96 LRS.
     Verify status by utilizing D04, D18, and M30 reports.
        3.2.1. Annotate on the AF Form 2413 or locally developed computer log, the date and
        time ordered/received and warehouse person contacted in 96 LRS. High priority call-
        ins/issues are ordered 02-aircraft-related and AGE and 03-for all other repairs. Place the
        AF Form 2005 in the inactive file for at least 1 calendar year.
        3.2.2. As parts are received, line through entire entries on the AF Form 2413 until
        complete. Maintain in accordance with AFPD 33-3, Information Management, and
        AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and dispose of in accordance with AFRIMS.
        Note: Locally developed logs will contain, as a minimum, all entries as shown on the AF
        Form 2413.
     3.3. SSUs will order requests using IMDS Screen 497, Option 1 (Order Unscheduled
     Maintenance Asset), which will transfer to Screen 072 (ES-S Issue Request Transaction).
     Use Order Option 1 and input all blocks except Transaction Exception (TEX) Code, FAD
     Code, MICAP Flag, and Deployed Code.
46TWI23-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                     5


     3.3.1. High-priority on-base issues are ordered priority 02/03 AA.
     3.3.2. Delayed discrepancies are ordered 03/04 BQ. Routine requests are ordered
     priority 05 using IMDS screen 072 with “order option” left blank.
     3.3.3. Input employee number, NSN, quantity, unit of issue, work unit code (WUC)
     input of Z, delivery destination, priority of 05, UJC CZ, work center mnemonic,
     organization and shop code; then transmit.
  3.4. The Request will output either an issue, kill, or reject notice. The Standard Base Supply
  System (SBSS) will automatically backorder the requested asset if none are in stock for
  urgency justification code (UJC) of B or C (UJC of BQ not included). Contact the Base
  Supply Customer Service Element (CSE) to initiate order when IMDS is down. All stock
  numbers not loaded must be loaded by the CSE. Once loaded, use IMDS Screen 497, Option
  4 (resubmit kill priority or reject) and input requested data. IMDS will output a requisition
  number from Base Supply. Annotate AF Form 2413 and AF Form 2005. Some CZ
  requirements will not provide a requisition number immediately. Use D04, D18, M30
  reports to follow up by referencing the requisition number.
     3.4.1. When the request issues, contact the expediter, Pro Super or AMU NCOIC upon
     receipt of parts. Update the AF Form 2413 or AF Form 2005 accordingly.
     3.4.2. When the request kills, IMDS will possibly output an Other Asset Notice (I023),
     listing mission support kit (MSK), mission readiness spares package (MRSP), bench
     stock, supply point, or special purpose recoverable authorized maintenance (SPRAM)
     asset.
         3.4.2.1. Contact the CSE to issue the part when an on-hand balance exists on the kill
         notice. The CSE will provide a new document number to use for DIFM turn-in.
         Annotate the document number on an AF Form 2413 or AF Form 2005. Upon receipt
         of the part, SSUs will contact the expediter and Pro Super.
         3.4.2.2. Annotate TRN in the remarks section of the AF Form 2520, AF Form 2413
         or AF Form 2005, indicating possible turnaround action, when there is a zero balance
         on base for the item ordered and it is a repair cycle item.
             3.4.2.2.1. Use TRN processing procedures (see paragraph 4.6.) when the repair
             shop can restore the part without backordering bits and pieces through the ES-S.
             Repair shops will inform the SSU when the item is available for pickup.
             3.4.2.2.2. When bits and pieces are required to be ordered, the repair shop will
             contact the applicable SSU to reprocess the document number using TEX Code 7.
             The SSU will inform the repair shop of the loaded document number, cross
             through TRN and write TEX 7. Repair shops will contact either the SSU or MSL
             to help determine whether to MICAP the end item or bits and pieces, based upon
             the parts availability. Repair shops will order the bits and pieces against the
             document number or the end item, placing the end item in AWP status. Shops
             ordering AWP items must input TEX Code 4 (fill or kill), check other possible
             base assets, and forward the AWP bits and pieces document number to SSU who
             will       annotate       the       document        numbers        on       the
             AF Form 2520, AF Form 2413 or AF Form 2005.
 6                                                              46TWI23-101 16 MARCH 2011


            3.4.2.3. When end items are ordered, reprocess the kill notice, TEX M and contact
            either the SSU or MSL to firm the due-out in ES-S. Repair shops will contact the
            SSU, who will reflect MICAP upgrade on the AF Form 2520, AF Form 2413, or AF
            Form 2005.
        3.4.3. When the IMDS input rejects; perform research actions to re-accomplish the
        transaction and clear all rejects as soon as possible. Contact the MSL for assistance, if
        needed.
     3.5. SSUs and back shops will input MICAP information for all aircraft, AGE, and engine
     end-items utilizing the ES-S web site.
     3.6. Initiate all aircraft CANNs through the 46 MXG, Maintenance Operations Center
     (MOC). The MOC will provide a CANN job number. Shops that CANN aircraft parts will
     use IMDS Screen 083 (Schedule CANN) and input the CANN job number and other
     pertinent data. IMDS will transfer to Screen 516 (Transfer Asset Accountability), then
     Screen 353 (ES-S MICAP 46 Notification Transaction) or 481 (SBSS Due-in/Due-out
     Update Transaction), depending on the type of CANN performed and the input requested
     data. Contact the SSU or MSL to input parts transfer into IMDS. Refer to 46 MXG OI 21-
     122 for further CANN guidance.
     3.7. Reference 46 MXG OI 21-101, Local Manufacture Procedures, for local procedures.
4. Repair Cycle Processing.
     4.1. Receive and transport reparable assets to the appropriate repair shop in an expedient
     manner. The 46 TW standards for movement of property are: MICAP, 2LM, and agile
     logistics- reparable assets to the repair shop within 1 hour after removal from aircraft or
     serviceable part receipt from Base Supply. All other reparable assets should be moved to the
     repair shop as soon as possible, but not later than end-of-shift
     4.2. Input the current DIFM status and location in IMDS or provide the status to the FSC or
     MSL when IMDS is inactive. Transporting personnel will not leave repair shop until this
     action is complete. Note: DIFM status codes reflect the status of the unserviceable reparable
     asset, not the issued asset. The Repair Cycle Management List (D23) is used to manage the
     flow of DIFM assets in the repair cycle and to ensure the DIFM status is updated. Review
     the D23 daily to ensure the appropriate DIFM status and location codes are accurately
     reflected in IMDS and ES-S. The wing standard for DIFM asset turn-in is: pre-day (2),
     repair day (2) and post day (1).
     4.3. The SSU will ensure flight line technicians complete all entries to AFTO Forms 350,
     annotating it as repair and return, the name of the repair shop, and maintenance priority code
     (MPC). The AFTO Form 350 will accompany all property to repair shops. Classified assets
     will have a stamp stating, “This item is classified and must be handled IAW AFI 31-401,
     Information Security Program Management,” on the front of the AFTO Form 350. All parts
     handlers will ensure proper documentation, tags, and a reusable container (or equivalent)
     accompanies the asset throughout the repair cycle.
     4.4. Use AF Form 2520 to record applicable information for TRN processing, and the kill
     notice document number, and ensure signature of recipient.
46TWI23-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                     7


  4.5. Upon delivery, the repair shop will reflect receipt of reparable assets by signing and
  dating the transporter’s AF Form 2520 and input the appropriate DIFM status and location in
  IMDS or; if IMDS is inactive, provide the status to the FSC/MSL. The D23 must be
  reviewed daily to ensure the appropriate maintenance DIFM status codes and property
  locations are accurately reflected. Note: DIFM status codes reflect the status of the
  unserviceable reparable asset, not the issued serviceable asset.
  4.6. When the repair shop can restore the part without backordering bits and pieces through
  the ES-S, use TRN processing procedures. TRN procedures are only used when due-out
  document numbers cannot or will not be established (maintenance action codes A, F, G, K,
  L, or Z qualify for TRN transactions). Provide the SSU with an estimated completion time
  and date. Maintain AF Form 2521, Turnaround Transaction Log, or locally developed log
  and use a completed AFTO Form 350, part 2 (annotate TRN in Block 15), to process
  transaction into IMDS (Screen 352 – ES-S TRN Transaction). When IMDS is inoperable,
  contact the FSC or MSL to assist.
  4.7. When assets are reparable and bits and pieces are needed, the repair shop will contact
  the SSU, placing items in AWP status. Annotate the AF Form 2413 with document number,
  time and individual contacted at the SSU. Shops ordering AWP items must input TEX Code
  4 (fill or kill) and check other possible base assets. The repair shop will inform the SSU and
  ordering originator of all actions (repair, NRTS, or AWP). The SSU will require the
  document number, noun, quantity, and aircraft tail number.
  4.8. When the applicable part cannot be repaired, the repair shop will call the SSU to re-
  input the kill notice, creating a due-out for the end item. SSU personnel will need an
  authorized verifier from the repair shop (provide authorization list to the MSL) and
  information from the TO. Provide the source maintenance and recoverability (SMR) code,
  quantity per assembly (QPA), next higher assembly (NHA) with part number, usable on code
  (UOC), acquisition advice code (AAC), TO, figure, index, and NRTS code. Annotate the AF
  Form 2413 with document number, time and individual contacted at the SSU.
  4.9. Flights or elements that CANN aircraft parts will initiate CANNs through the MOC.
  The MOC will provide a CANN job number. Shops will use IMDS Screen 083 (Schedule
  CANN) and input the CANN job number and other pertinent data. IMDS will transfer to
  Screen 353 (ES-S MICAP Notification Transaction) or 481 (SBSS Due-in/Due-out Update
  Transaction), depending on the type of CANN performed and data input requested. Contact
  SSU or the MSL to input parts transfer into IMDS or ES-S. Elements that CANN aircraft
  parts will use proper procedures for cross-CANN of reparable assets to reduce AWP end
  units.
  4.10. Ensure parts coded AWM and AWP are stored separately in clearly marked storage
  areas. Review the AWP Validation Listing (D19) daily, check for cross-CANN candidates; if
  cross-CANN is feasible, provide the FSC or MSL with DIFM AWP end item and due-out
  document numbers to update supply database. Ensure DIFM detail change inputs (i.e.,
  DFM) reflect all end item changes by validating the D19 against the AF Form 2413 daily.
  Identify to MSL unacceptable supply status impacts for possible mission impact letters or
  disposition of assets to repair facility (only item managers have disposition authority); if
  directed to return asset to repair facility, ensure AFTO Form 350 tag reflects NRTS Code 4
  authority.
 8                                                               46TWI23-101 16 MARCH 2011


     4.11. Base Supply personnel will pick up NRTS items from repair shops and deliver to the
     FSC. All parts handlers will ensure proper documentation, tags, and reusable container (or
     equivalent) accompanies the asset throughout the repair cycle.
     4.12. Repair shops will call the appropriate SSU when backordered aircraft MICAP parts are

     6.1. Prior to ordering, the technician or specialist will verify UND A, B, or C requests.
     6.2. Order a part on IMDS Screen 497, Option 1, which will transfer to Screen 072. Use
     Order Option 1 and input all blocks except TEX Code, FAD Code, MICAP Flag, and

     Option 4 (resubmit kill priority or reject), and input requested data. IMDS will output a
     requisition number from Base Supply. ES-S will automatically backorder the requested asset
     if there are none in stock for UND of B or C (except UJC BQ).
     6.4. When zero balance is indicated on the I023 notice, go to Screen 497, Option 4, and
     input the document number. IMDS will transfer to Screen 072; input order option 2,
     employee number, change UJC code to appropriate non-MICAP UJC, TEX Code M and
     transmit.
     6.5. IMDS will output a requisition number from Base Supply. Annotate AF Form 2005 and
