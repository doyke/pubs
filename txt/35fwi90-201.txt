SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Substantive changes include removal of most information covered in other written guidance.
Casualty reporting and transport procedures are significantly changed. The exercise security and
small arms sections were completely revised to include selective arming. The discussion of play
areas and procedures was consolidated and procedures for entering play were clarified.
Procedures for simulating building damage and repair were clarified and an exemption for snow
removal personnel was added as standing guidance. A simulation for issuing replacement
common access cards (CAC) was added. Numerous and significant changes to maintenance
exercise procedures were adopted throughout. In addition, the capability to demonstrate
contingency airfield lighting was removed.

         1.7.3.1. Messages addressing deliverables will include the deliverable source data
         (e.g. LOI #XX) in the subject line.
     1.7.4. Telephone contact with IGI will be at 226-3515 and may be made by Emergency
     Operations Center (EOC) personnel to clarify information. Unit members will not call
     directly to IGI.
     1.7.5. Reporting exercise emergencies via telephone will be conducted using the 911-
     system with the exception of Munitions Control (hotline). When reporting exercise
     emergencies, callers will begin and end the call by stating: ―EXERCISE, EXERCISE,
     EXERCISE‖.
  1.8. Personnel Casualties and Attritions.
     1.8.1. Casualties which have not been determined to be fatalities must be transported via
     buddy system to the Casualty Collection Point (CCP). Remains of patients who expire at
     the CCP will be transported from the CCP to the MACP. Transportation will be
     coordinated by Mortuary Affairs personnel. A medical doctor will provide a death
     certificate to the MACP personnel.
     1.8.2. Mortuary Affairs Collection Point (MACP). Obviously dead (e.g., decapitated or
     labeled as "Dead" in the scenario) personnel may be transported directly to Bldg 420
     (Mortuary Affairs Collection Point) by vehicles of opportunity using the buddy system.
     The Medical Control Center (MCC), via the EOC, will arrange for a medical doctor to
     report to the MACP to provide death certificates.
     1.8.3. When EET members are using a role player from the EET moulage station, the
     role player will be given the identity of the affected exercise participant. The exercise
     participant will comply with EET instruction for duty reporting. The role player will
     maintain the exercise participant’s identity throughout processing until released back to
     the moulage station.
     1.8.4. IGI will manage an attrition center at building 674 to increase exercise motivation
     and provide reinforced training. EET will send personnel to the attrition center for failing
     to take appropriate self-protective measures, not displaying the proper sense of urgency,
     or displaying a hostile/disrespectful attitude. Evaluators will note full name, rank and
     unit of assignment of individual attrited. Personnel will be out of action for a 4 to 12-
     hour work period or report at the end of their shift and work additional duty for two hours
     before returning home (EET/work center discretion.)
  1.9. Vehicle, Equipment, and Building Damage.
     1.9.1. Equipment/Vehicles. EET will tag all damaged/destroyed equipment and vehicles
     with a placard. A brief narrative will include damage/destruction/contamination and a
     get-well time. Simulated damaged equipment may be returned to service prior to the get-
     well time if repair/ decontamination capability exists and is demonstrated.
     1.9.2. Buildings/Facilities. Simulated building/facility damage will be pre-coordinated
     through CES EET and placed at the facility using 4’ X 4’ orange damage identification
     boards that are placed by a member of CES EET or trusted agent. The amount of time a
     facility will be affected by damage will be determined by the CES estimation based upon
     materials on hand, level of training and expertise, and recommendation of the crew on
6                                                        35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011


       scene. Damaged facilities will be prioritized and repaired IAW paragraph 1.9.4.
       Buildings will be released back to units through the 35 Civil Engineering Squadron
       (CES) UCC with approval of 35 CES EET.
       1.9.3. Relocation/Evacuation of Facilities. If a building is simulated destroyed, all
       occupants must be evacuated, if damaged, CES/work center must evaluate safety before
       returning. Exceptions include real world emergency response or buildings containing
       classified material that cannot be secured or moved, funds, arms, or munitions. One
       person may remain inside these facilities to provide security. Facilities that maintain
       funds must be secured IAW AFI 31-101. Propulsion personnel actively involved in
       Queen Bee maintenance for other wings will not evacuate.
       1.9.4. Contracting/comptrollers will demonstrate actions required to repair or replace
       simulated damaged facilities, utility systems, vehicles and depleted material stockpiles.
       Actions will include contracting construction, material acquisition, and
       equipment/vehicle acquisition. Contracting support should be limited only by emergency
       funding approval limits and local manpower support.
       1.9.5. Replacement of damaged or destroyed deployed support equipment at Base X/Y.
       Deployed equipment custodian will contact host base LRS with information on damaged
       equipment. Host base LRS will reallocate equipment per availability to replace damaged
       or destroyed equipment and provide status to the deployed custodian. The deployed
       custodian will contact home station LRS for reconstitution.
    1.10. Commercial Power/Water Outage.
       1.10.1. The objective of these scenarios is to evaluate the ability to continue operations
       without commercial power for at least 24 hours. Specific objectives include
       demonstrations of automatic transfer to back-up power, emergency generator back-up
       reliability and management of generator fuel supply. 35 CES personnel may be tasked to
       simulate damage to off-base commercial power facilities or lines beyond their ability to
       repair. 35 CES electricians will monitor actions taken.
       1.10.2. For facilities with automatic start and transfer capabilities, CE will open the
       facility’s commercial power circuit breaker to activate the automatic start and transfer
       sequence. Trained personnel from the using organization will be prepared to perform
       manual start and transfer procedures should the automatic system fail or an evaluator
       disables the automatic start and transfer system.
       1.10.3. For facilities without automatic start and transfer capabilities, trained personnel
       from the owning organization will perform the start and transfer procedure.
       1.10.4. Units will be given guidance prior to the evaluation, including the facilities and
       times. No prior power transfer actions will be accomplished.
       1.10.5. The Command Post (CP), Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC) and tasked
       unit’s UCC will be notified at least 30 minutes prior to the beginning of power outage
       scenarios affecting their facility to ensure real world operations are not affected.
       1.10.6. Base Water Supply Disruption. 35 CES may be tasked to simulate cutting off or
       disrupting the water supply to all or a portion of the base to simulate loss of potable
       water. Details will be coordinated with the 35 CES EET. If water disruption does not
35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                      7


     affect the entire installation, damage cards will be located on facilities to show time
     frames of water outage.
  1.11. Supply Procedures.
     1.11.1. When exercising at Base X/Y, 35 LRS will act as host base support.
     1.11.2. For Base Y/fight-in-place scenarios, parts are immediately available if they exist
     at Misawa. For Base X scenarios the following procedures apply:
        1.11.2.1. The 735th SCOG, Supply Chain Operations Group will source for assets
        affecting real world Non Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) assets that are not in the
        Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) and are required at Base X. If available
        at Base X and Misawa, then the asset will be made available immediately. If the part
        is only available at Misawa, the deployed aircraft receiving these parts cannot be used
        until after the simulated delivery time from Misawa (IAW para. 1.11.3.) to the
        deployed location.
        1.11.2.2. Expendable part requirements will be filled from deployed bench stock, if
        available. If not, then they may be filled from MRSP or the Consumables Readiness
        Spares Package (CRSP). If the part is not available from the first two sources, then
        the part may be requested from the Base X aircraft parts store. In this case, the part
        will be ordered under activity code―J‖ with the appropriate organization code and an
        8000 series document number.
     1.11.3. Supply Transportation Delays.
        1.11.3.1. If part is in MRSP it is immediately available.
        1.11.3.2. If the part is located within the theater of operation, ship time is 6 hours.
        1.11.3.3. If the part is located within Japan, ship time is 12 hours.
        1.11.3.4. If located CONUS, ship time is 24 hours.
     1.11.4. MRSP/CRSP replenishments (due-out releases) received at Misawa AB will be
     delivered to building 3122 IAW normal procedures. Required time frames from Para
     1.11.3. must elapse from the date/time of document preparation to simulate pipeline time
     before items are released.
     1.11.5. Phase supply transactions will not be processed through the deployed Combat
     Supply Activity (CSA).
     1.11.6. CSA will deploy with a computer loaded with up-to-date copies of appropriate
     software, and will demonstrate the process of transferring the MRSP to the deployed
     location.
     1.11.7. Items issued from the deployed MRSP/CRSP and deemed Not Repairable This
     Station(NRTS) by deployed Base X maintenance will be prepared for shipment to the
     Base X Flight Service Center (FSC).
     1.11.8. Turn-in actions on repairable assets issued from the Base X supply will be
     processed through the FSC.

       1.11.9. NMCS Conditions Mission Capable (MICAPS) Slides. MICAP slides will only
       show simulated deployed aircraft MICAPs. During exercises/inspections the CSA should
       provide the MICAP/NMCS data for deployed aircraft.
    1.12. Biological Warfare/Chemical Warfare (BW/CW) Agent Antidote Simulators and
    Simulated M295 Decontamination Kits.
       1.12.1. Issue may be individual or bulk, and will originate, with advice from the
       MAJCOM/SG, from the simulated Theater Commander or the MAJCOM.
       1.12.2. IRRE. Medical Logistics will distribute simulated Soman Nerve Agent
       Pretreatment Pyridostigmine (SNAPP) tablets, Convulsant Antidote for Nerve Agent
       Injection (CANA), Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto injector (ATNAA), and
       Ciprofloxacin tablets at the Personnel Deployment Function (PDF)/mobility line (as
       required) or distribute through units if needed prior to processing.
       1.12.3. CERE and ORE. Units will identify individuals authorized to pick up BW/CW
       agent antidotes by letter to 35 MDG/SGSM (Medical Logistics). Medical Logistics will
       distribute simulated SNAPP tablets, CANA, Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto
       injector (ATNAA), and Ciprofloxacin tablets to unit representatives (as required). The
       authorized unit representative will pick up simulators at Medical Logistics, Building 99
       IAW direction from FW/CC or CAT. Issue of simulated BW/CW agent antidotes is
       limited to the amount of supplies currently on-hand.
       1.12.4. At 35 FW/CC or CAT direction, all personnel will annotate administration of
       simulated Ciprofloxacin and/or SNAPP antidotes on the respective simulation card.
       1.12.5. Store all simulators inside the individual equipment carrier bag unless directed
       otherwise by the CAT.
       1.12.6. M295 Kits. PACAF simulation 2.6 states that M295 kits may be simulated with
       training aids, but provides no guidance on type. The M295 decontamination kit will be
       simulated by a brown paper bag with ―Sim M295‖ written on the bag.
    1.13. Exercise Security.
       1.13.1. The senior Security Forces Squadron (SFS) EET member on scene will be the
       exercise monitor during exercises involving security forces. The exercise monitor
       approves/disapproves on-scene actions for security forces exercises and can
       interpret/terminate the inject as required.
       1.13.2. Security Forces will maintain real world posts and patrols throughout the base, to
       include exercise play areas; they will only respond to IRRE (phase I) scenarios that have
       been coordinated with SFS/EET. Real world posts and patrols carry live ammunition and
       will not respond to CERE (phase II) scenarios. NOTE: Due to ―location of training,
       requiring an armed guard’s presence,‖ the CP Entry Controller and/or other designated
       personnel will readily identify his/her weapon(s) with red tape (two inches in width)
       around the M9 pistol grip and/or lower most portion of the M4/M16 magazine IAW
       AFMAN 31-229, Para. 4.1.5.
       1.13.3. Personnel in MOPP 3 or 4, attempting to enter through a restricted area manned
       ECP will comply with all chemical/knock code procedures and then remove their
       protective mask to enable positive identification IAW AFI 31-101.
35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011                                                              9


     1.13.4. EET members will be treated as the IG and processed into restricted areas IAW
     AFI 31-101, PACAF Sup 1, through physical verification of the restricted area badge
     against the Entry Authorization Listing (EAL). EET members will not attempt to
     surreptitiously enter a restricted/ controlled area through the use of falsified
     identification.
  1.14. Small Arms Weapons.
     1.14.1. Security Forces Posture and Weapons Use during IRRE.
        1.14.1.1. There will be no use of blank ammunition or large scale force-on-force
        scenarios during an IRRE. SF posts and patrols will be armed with weapons
        prescribed in the post priority chart. Armed is defined as having the appropriate
        weapon system, to include live ammunition.
        1.14.1.2. 35 FW/CC will determine when senior installation leadership (O-6 or
        higher) will be required to carry their assigned M9. Unless specifically directed,
        senior leadership may carry live rounds, but must be qualified on the weapon, sign
        acknowledgement of the ―Lautenberg Amendment‖ and have current Use of Force
        Training documented IAW AFI 31-207 and AFMAN 31-229. Senior leadership will
        sign-out their respective M9s at the SF armory prior to shift and return them at the
        end of shift.
        1.14.1.3. Other units or personnel will not carry armed weapons unless specifically
        outlined in the overall base defense plan or as part of their routine duties.
        Coordination with the Defense Force Commander (DFC) is mandatory. This does not
        apply to personnel required to be armed while performing weapons, munitions, and
        funds security duties. Security Forces must be notified anytime personnel are armed.
        1.14.1.4. Safety will be paramount at all times. During exercise scenarios all
        personnel will respond:
            1.14.1.4.1. With M9 or other approved pistol safely secured in an approved
            holster. DO NOT draw the M9 or other handgun from the holster during
            exercises.
            1.14.1.4.2. With the M4/M16 (with or without the M203 attached) at port arms,
            or muzzle pointed downward while using a combat sling, and the selector on
            ―SAFE‖. At no time will a round be chambered.
            1.14.1.4.3. Carry the M240/M249 utilizing the shoulder strap with the muzzle
            pointed downward. If mounted on a vehicle, muzzles will be pointed up.
            Ammunition will not be loaded into the weapons.
        1.14.1.5. Security Forces will prioritize real-world dispatches over exercise
        participation. The on-duty Flight Sergeant/Leader and SFS/EET Lead will determine
        whether or not exercise scenarios should be temporarily halted due to real world
        response requirements.
     1.14.2. Security Forces Posture and Use of Weapons during CERE.
        1.14.2.1. Real world Security Forces posts and patrols will not participate in CERE
        scenarios. Real world posts and patrols will be distinguished by wearing the SF/SP
10                                                 35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011


     brassard on their left shoulder. They are not required to wear IPE or MOPP gear
     unless real world responses dictate that equipment be employed for real world
     protection. The CP Entry Controller will not wear a brassard, but be armed with a
     designated weapon marked IAW paragraph 1.13.2. of this instruction. He/she will
     wear IPE/MOPP in response to exercise scenarios while providing real world
     resource protection IAW AFI 31-101.
     1.14.2.2. Blank ammunition will not be used at any time on Misawa AB without
     coordination with the 35 FW/SEW, 35 FW/XPI and 35 SFS/CC offices. Units with
     selected personnel to carry weapons during a CERE will coordinate their
     requirements with the DFC by contacting the 35 SFS Standardization and Evaluation
     Office. Personnel are not required to be ―qualified‖ on a particular weapon system to
     participate in exercises. However, units are required to train personnel on the working
     knowledge of the weapon being handled, general weapons/exercise safety and
     distinction between blank and live ammunition. This training must be documented on
     AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training or AF Form 797,
     Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS. Blank ammunition will not
     be fired within 20 feet of the target (i.e. any person or thing).
     1.14.2.3. Exercise weapons will be fitted with the prescribed blank adapters (―RED‖
     for all versions of the M16; ―YELLOW‖ for M4, M249 and M240) regardless if
     blank ammunition is used. Magazines loaded with blank ammunition will have a blue
     band (taped or painted), at least two inches in width, around the lower most portion so
     it is visible while inserted in the magazine well.
     1.14.2.4. Since the M9 and most other handguns do not have a blank firing adaptor;
     exercise participants will not be issued blank ammunition for these weapons. The
     only exception is the M15 used to conduct Military Working Dog training, in which
     case personnel are trained pursuant to specialized guidance outside the scope of this
     instruction. Personnel will not insert a magazine into exercise handguns used during
     CERE. NOTE: Scenarios requiring evaluation of specialized TTP (e.g. SF High Risk
     Response) may require pistol draw at the discretion of evaluators. Clearly identified
     personnel will receive specialized weapons handling instructions whenever pistol
     draw may be required (550-cord will be strung through the barrel and chamber).
     1.14.2.5. 35 FW/CC will determine when senior installation leadership (O-6 or
     higher) will be required to carry their assigned M9. If the carrier is in possession of
     live ammunition, they must designate their weapon as ―armed‖ by marking it with a
     red in color two inch wide band, taped around the handgrip (just above the magazine
     well); keep it in an approved holster while following guidance provided in paragraph
     1.14.1.2. of this instruction.
     1.14.2.6. At a minimum during a CERE, Security Forces personnel will consist of the
     hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) area ECP Guard (Bldg #3002), HAS area ISRT, CP
     Guard, UCC, and emergency support function (ESF-13) representative. BDOC will
     support exercise scenario C2 in concert with the UCC. BDOC controllers will wear a
     brassard IAW paragraph 1.14.2.1. of this instruction and not be required to don
     IPE/MOPP gear in response to CERE scenarios since they must continue to perform
35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                11


         real-world SF duties/responsibilities. Although Bldg #648 and portions of #646
         remain no-play areas, the interior portion of the UCC will remain in-play.
  1.15. Vehicle Safety, Security, and Operation.
     1.15.1. Government owned vehicles (GOV) which cannot be locked due to malfunction
     or design require a ―Does Not Lock/Does Not Lock by Design‖ sticker provided by 35
     LRS and have the discrepancy annotated on the waiver card.
     1.15.2. M-Series 2.5 and 5-ton trucks will be locked by chaining the steering wheels to
     the floor and securing with a lock.
     1.15.3. LRS fueling vehicles will remain unlocked with key in ignition IAW AFI 23-201.
     1.15.4. Emergency response vehicles will comply with all traffic control devices,
     proceeding through red lights after full stop to ensure no traffic movement. Vehicles will
     also adhere to posted speed limits when responding to exercise scenarios. The use of
     emergency lights will be used for realism but vehicle mounted sirens use should be kept
     to minimum required to gain other drivers’ attention.
     1.15.5. While driving POVs, the protective mask will not be worn. Other IPE/CWDE
     wear is at the discretion of the driver.
     1.15.6. GOV drivers and passengers are required to wear IPE/CWDE gear. Prior to
     driving a GOV while wearing the protective mask, Protective Mask Driver Training must
     be accomplished. Drivers entering a controlled movement area will remove their mask
     prior to radio request for clearance and will remain unmasked while in that area.
     1.15.7. When operating a GOV, react to alarm conditions/MOPP levels after pulling off
     at the nearest intersection or parking lot.
  1.16. Snow Removal Operations.
     1.16.1. From Nov-Mar, 35th Civil Engineering Squadron (35CES) personnel assigned to
     snow removal operations will be postured for exercises on shifts. These members are
     exercise participants until released to perform snow removal operations by the CES UCC
     Chief. The CES UCC Chief will advise the CE EOC Rep that snow removal operations
     are required.
     1.16.2. 35 CES personnel assigned to real world snow removal operations will become
     non-players from the onset of snow removal operations until successful completion.
     Snow removal personnel will become full exercise participants after release from their
     assigned snow removal shift (work cycle rest permitting).
     1.16.3. Snow removal crews will not respond to attacks nor are they subject to EET
     injects.
     1.16.4. Members involved in real world snow removal will be identified prior to
     STARTEX and the list will be maintained by the CE UCC. Snow removal personnel will
     wear ABUs and will be issued non-player cards through the 35 CES UCC upon initiation
     of snow removal operations. Upon completion, they will return the non-player cards and
     resume exercise participation.
12                                                      35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011


  1.17. Flight line Weapons Safety and Security.
     1.17.1. Aircraft loaded with live or simulated munitions will comply with safe separation
     distances and will be in adherence with AFMAN 91-201 PACAF Sup I, Explosives
     Safety Standards. Aircraft loaded with actual or simulated forward-firing munitions will
     be oriented to minimize hazards to other aircraft, personnel, and facilities.
     1.17.2. Missile assets not loaded on aircraft will not be left unattended on the flight line.
     At least one individual will remain with the assets. During alarm red/ blue, the individual
     will assume applicable MOPP but will not leave the assets for the purpose of duck and
     cover.
  1.18. Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) Reporting. The 35 FW SORTS
  Manager will provide the EET with a current ―easy read‖ retrieval which includes remarks
  fields and SORTS data for all 35 FW SORTS reporting at the start of the exercise
  (STARTEX.) In the event of an exercise change in a unit’s C-level, the EET will be provided
  a copy of the C-level change.
  1.19. Chaplain Support. Chaplains will provide normal contingency services during IRRE
  and act as a host base support function during CERE. Chaplains and Chaplain Assistants
  function as a Religious Support Team (RSTs) during exercises/inspections. Command and
  control of Religious Support Teams will fall under the Chapel Control Center in coordination
  with the CPTS/UCC.
  1.20. Exercise Players and Play Areas.
     1.20.1. All persons on Misawa AB may be exercise players depending upon the type of
     exercise. Exceptions to this instruction will be documented on a 35 FW/CC approved
     exemption letter (see Attachment 2). The exercise play areas may be amended via the
     exercise Letters of Instruction (LOIs.) When a conflict occurs between this publication
     and the LOIs, the LOI takes precedence. Exercise types and participation level are as
     follows:
     1.20.2. Emergency Management Exercise (EME): all personnel on Misawa Air Base (US
     and Japanese, military and civilian) may be players depending on the type of exercise and
     location. Non-player personnel may be impacted by exercise operations without warning
     (i.e. gate closure, traffic re-routing.) 35 FW/IGI will plan to limit exercise participation
     to units/personnel requesting to participate. When exercise operations are expected to
     impact non-player units or personnel (e.g. road closures, explosive cordons) 35 FW/IGI
     will coordinate to minimize the impact on those organizations. At a minimum, 35
     FW/IGI will notify affected units of the time, date, location and expected duration of the
     mission impact.
     1.20.3. IRRE or Misawa, fight in place: all US military personnel and mission critical
     civilian personnel are players. By default, Tenant Units and JASDF Units are non-
     players. If JASDF or Tenant Units are players in the exercise, play areas and personnel
     will be specified in the exercise LOI.
     1.20.4. IRRE or Misawa, fight in place, play area: all of Misawa Air Base is a play area
     with the exception of the following: JASDF areas/buildings, Tenant Unit areas/buildings,
     locations identified in PACAF Standard Simulation 2.12 (or most current simulation for
35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  13


     relief from FPCON response), family housing areas, schools and the Sunrise Control (35
     FW/IGI) operating location.
     1.20.5. In order to accommodate the deployment portion of an IRRE, Base X/Y will
     involve the contiguous area made up of: flight line restricted area north of the runway, all
     USAF aircraft movement areas north of and including the runway, portions of the
     Munitions Storage Area (buildings 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446 A-S, and 1497), building 928
     and the alternate CP (in the event of relocation).
        1.20.5.1. The Falcon Feeder is a joint-use deployed and non-deployed facility.
        1.20.5.2. A maximum of four hot pits are available at Base X.
     1.20.6. Base X/Y scenarios (deployed): all 35 FW personnel are players. Participants not
     identified in applicable Operations Plan (OPLAN) UTCs will act as host base support
     personnel. Tenant units and JASDF are not players unless they specifically request to
     participate and are identified in the exercise LOI.
     1.20.7. Base X CERE Play Areas.
        1.20.7.1. Sector 1A: Southeast of bldg 1459 (23.1, AA.4 – Alternate unexploded

        terminal and the first row of parking spaces around the building are no play areas.
            1.20.7.5.1. Sector VB: [Many buildings are partial play in this area; units are
 14                                                       35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011


             responsible for clearly marking play/no-play areas to the satisfaction of
             EET/Inspectors.] Bldg 420 (this bldg is dual occupied with NAF employees; only
             2 freezer bays and the adjoining area will be play areas), 431, 434, 437, 439, 451,
             452, 460, 465, 470, 475, 482, 496, 500, 512, 513, 557, 640, 646 (UCC area only,)
             653 (this bldg is dual-occupied with NAF/APF employees and only the west
             quarter of the first floor will be considered in-play,) 761, 790 (east side), 793 (first
             floor, room 112 and 114), 794 and 795. All areas within bldg 465 and fuel tank
             farm 1 are no play. Dormitories will be considered no-play areas along with the
             surrounding lawns to ensure grounds keeping activities may be completed.
             1.20.7.5.2. Sector VB: Medical Complex to include Bldg 99 and 96 are play
             areas during Base X/Y IRRE/CEREs.
                 1.20.7.5.2.1. The Medical Control Center (Bldg 99, Room LF01) and the
                 Deployed Medical Facility (DMF), consisting of the CCP and patient
                 decontamination tents, will be considered "play areas," during operations
                 using the DMF construct.
          1.20.7.6. Apply the following general guidance for play vs. non-play areas:
             1.20.7.6.1. Exercise play begins upon arrival at your work station. Prior to this
             point, even when traversing roads/areas that are play areas, individuals are not
             players. Transition areas (TAs) are also no play areas.
             1.20.7.6.2. Once entering play, individuals remain in play anytime they are
             performing official duties. If these duties require transit through, or work within,
             non-play areas (e.g. filling sandbags in a parking lot not specifically designated as
             a play area) individuals will be considered in-play and must comply with all
             attack/IPE requirements for the zone they are operating in. Entering a non-play
             structure solely to avoid attack response will result in attrition by EET.
             Individuals should remain in-play and within the play area to the max extent
             possible.
             1.20.7.6.3. Personnel who are meal card holders participating in the CERE may
             access the Grissom Dining Facility (DFAC) while on shift/in play only to obtain
             either a box meal or an MRE. Personnel must enter DFAC through the Flight
             Kitchen side entrance to access the box meal/MRE distribution point and are not
             authorized to lounge in the main dining room. Since DFAC is a no play area,
             personnel are not required to don their MOPP gear if ALARM BLUE is declared.
             Personnel will remain at DFAC until authorization for movement is granted or the
             Alarm condition reverts to GREEN or YELLOW.
2. Initial Response Readiness Exercise
   2.1. Cargo Deployment.
      2.1.1. Copies of messages dispatched by the Deployment Control Center (DCC) will be
      delivered to the deployment EET evaluator for response and/or action.
      2.1.2. A 35 LRS EET representative will place a second placard on pallets near the
      original placard upon completion of processing at the Cargo Deployment Function (CDF)
      denoting the pallet is released to the wing for transportation to the Base X/Y marshaling
35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 15


     area or a drop-off point. The streamer will be annotated with the chalk number and arrival
     time plus 45 minutes. The cargo cannot be opened until after the aircraft final destination
     arrival time plus 45 minutes to account for handling time. EET may waive the time on a
     case-by-case basis. Cargo will be moved into the Base X/Y area through the Bldg 3001
     ECP.
     2.1.3. The CDF will provide Contracted Airfield Transportation Operations (CATO) and
     Air Mobility Command (AMC) briefings to the deployment EET evaluator. Briefings
     will be conducted at Quality Control (QC) package completion time.

     placard.
     2.1.5. Munitions with hazard classifications 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 (over 14,000 lbs NEW) will
     be in-checked at the hot cargo pad by a mobile in-check team from the CDF. Units with
     hot cargo and other cargo designated on the same increment will have cargo delivered
     directly to the hot cargo pad in accordance with the Deployment Schedule of Events
     (DSOE). It is the unit’s responsibility to coordinate with Deployment Vehicle Operations
     to transport all cargo requiring processing at the hot cargo pad to that location.
     2.1.6. Upon completion of the Joint Inspection (JI), classified and weapons increments
     will be immediately transported back to the work center in coordination with the owning
     squadron’s UCC/Unit Deployment Manager (UDM).
     2.1.7. War Reserve Material (WRM) munitions out-load, if tasked, will be conducted in
     accordance with the Munitions Out-load Plan and the Installation Deployment Plan
     (IDP).

        X assets will be utilized to support munitions out-load.
        2.1.7.2. Blocking and bracing is a combined effort of 35 LRS and 35 MXS
        personnel/ augmentees. 35 LRS personnel will perform vehicle safety inspections,
        certify loads and provide drivers with special instructions for surface movements. 35
        MXS personnel will prepare munitions assets, load vehicles and provide shipping
        documents. 35 LRS will coordinate with 35 CONS for procurement of commercial
        vehicles required for surface movements.
        2.1.7.3. Munitions assets identified for shipment under the Non Unit Record Time
        Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) WRM out-load will be in-checked and
        have the JI conducted at staging areas inside the Munitions Storage Area. All assets
        must be delivered to the hot cargo pad for simulated loading.
     2.1.8. There will be no simulations for issuing ammunition; it will be hand carried or
     bulk shipped. Munitions account custodians must comply with transportation
     requirements (GOV, fire extinguishers, placards, etc.)
  2.2. Personnel Deployment.
     2.2.1. Deploying personnel may not report for duty at Base X until their designated
     arrival time. Once deploying personnel have simulated loading their aircraft, they will not
     perform any official duties at Misawa AB.
16                                                    35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011


     2.2.2. Deployed personnel will be listed on deployment orders and will be identified by
     wearing a piece of colored ribbon on their outer uniform. Ribbon will be issued by 35
     FSS processing line personnel.
     2.2.3. Personnel Simulations.
        2.2.3.1. Upon approval by 35 FW/IGI, all non-participating personnel that are
        recallable and can meet assigned tasking can be simulated. The simulation request
        must be accompanied by a recall message for the affected personnel. The request will
        clearly identify when the individual will be simulated available. Format requests IAW
        Attachment 3 of this instruction. Format recall message IAW 35 FWI 10-208,
        Pyramid Recall.
        2.2.3.2. EET members reflected against a unit deployment position number may be
        simulated for IRRE deployment. Simulation requests are not required; EET members
        will place a copy of their EET appointment letter in their mobility folder instead of a
        simulation letter.
     2.2.4. Personnel Deployment Function (PDF) Common Access Card (CAC( Issue
     Procedures.
        2.2.4.1. All personnel processing the PDF line with an invalid CAC per Table 12.1 in
        AFI 36-3026 will be issued a new CAC. All personnel processing the line with a
        CAC expiring within the time period specified by applicable reporting requirements
        will be processed for a new CAC up to, but not including, the actual issue of the
        CAC. In both cases, personnel will then be reinserted into the PDF line to complete
        processing. A simulated CAC replacement memorandum (IAW paragraph 2.2.4.2.
        below) will be treated as a valid CAC for the duration of the exercise deployment.
        2.2.4.2. At any time following the exercise Warning Order (WARNORD) and/or as
        directed by FW leadership, personnel with a CAC that would require re-issue may
        visit the MPS where they will either be issued a new CAC or provided a
        memorandum indicating they would have received a CAC had this been a real world
        contingency. Requirements for re-issue of CAC cards are listed in AFI 36-3026,
        Table 12.1, or in the reporting requirements for the exercise deployed location.
        Personnel processing the PDF line with the memorandum will process as if they have
        valid CAC, unless directed otherwise by an inspector or EET representative.
  2.3. Reception and Bed down (R&B).
     2.3.1. The Reception Control Center (RCC) will process inbound personnel and cargo
     IAW the In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan (IGESP). The DCC will normally receive a
     message of inbound forces.
     2.3.2. 35 FW/IGI will task the wing through a LOI to provide role players and simulated
     cargo (normally wooden skid pallets) to process through the RCC (see above). Troop
     commander packages will be developed by 35 FW/IGI and provided for each inbound
     reception.
     2.3.3. 35 FW/IGI will provide R&B role-player information to include home station,
     AFSC, assigned wartime duties, and unit.
35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                17


     2.3.4. The receiving unit will provide incoming personnel with work location and
     planned employment. Organizations will integrate arriving members, to include
     providing work schedules. The R&B evaluation will end when the inbound work forces
     have received the reception briefing and are integrated with the host unit.
     2.3.5. 35 FSS will develop a plan to lodge all incoming forces identified in the R&B
     scenario IAW the Misawa AB IGESP. In addition, they will demonstrate the ability to
     actually lodge those personnel acting as inbound forces.
        2.3.5.1. Lodging arrangements will be made but not executed. One lodging room of
        each configuration (TLF and VQ) will be set-up in emergency capacity configuration
        for exercise/inspection purposes.
        2.3.5.2. A lodging specialist will be co-located with the personnel support for
        contingency operations (PERSCO) unit to coordinate bed down of incoming forces,
        to include locator service, and room/tent assignments. The lodging position will be
        continuously manned until force reception is completed.
  2.4. 35 MDG requirements
     2.4.1. 35 MDG will expand when directed by the 35 MDG/CC and organize its medical
     assets into 3E medical services. 35 MDG will activate Home Station Medical Response
     (HSMR) Teams, MCRP Teams and/or UTCs to facilitate exercise casualty assessment,
     treatment and evacuation as required.
     2.4.2. 35 MDG will mobilize and process personnel and equipment UTCs IAW exercise
     TPFDD. In a combined IRRE/CERE, the following UTCs should be mobilized: FFGLB
     (19 PAX), FFGLA (WRM), FFPCM (3 PAX), and FFLGE (WRM). In IRRE-only
     exercises, all UTCs on the 35 MDG Medical Resource List (MRL) should process on a
     rotating basis to ensure each is activated at least once every 12 months.
  2.5. Aircraft Generation.
     2.5.1. Live munitions or hot guns will not be flown during exercise deployment sorties
     unless approved by 35 FW CC. Elephant walks may be conducted with live munitions
     and hot guns.
     2.5.2. Simulated combat pre-issue inspection procedures will be used. Munitions and
     components with service/shelf life restrictions or hermetically sealed containers will not
     be opened with the exception of impulse cartridges. Hermetically sealed components will
     be delivered to the buildup area, but will not be installed on assembled munitions.
     Instead, inert munitions of the same type will be used to demonstrate tasks involved in
     assembly. These inert components will be removed from assembled munitions prior to
     delivery to the flight line.
     2.5.3. Weapons loading/unloading activities, simulated actions and simulated loads, will
     be recorded in the aircraft’s AFTO Form 781A. Simulation actions may also be recorded
     on job standards (JST) for aircraft generation.
     2.5.4. The weapons expeditor will accomplish an AF Form 2434 to indicate actual and
     simulated load configurations. The full standard conventional load (SCL) will remain
     loaded until EET acceptance, after which the deploying unit may download munitions
     and reconfigure aircraft as required.
18                                                     35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011


     2.5.5. The aircraft maintenance unit (AMU) Production Superintendent will inform EET
     of aircraft availability/priority for acceptance inspections. EET will report all
     discrepancies to the AMU Production Superintendent and make an AFTO Form 781A
     entry when their inspection is complete. Aircraft inspection, acceptance, and generation
     scoring will be performed IAW procedures in PACAFI 90-201.
  2.6. IRRE Base X Ground Rules.

     will simultaneously serve Misawa and Base X/Y.
     2.7.2. Personnel who arrive at Base X prior to the aircraft will use the other squadron’s
     net and preface their call signs with ―X-ray.‖ Deployed personnel may coordinate Base X
     support directly until the arrival of the first aircraft.
     2.7.3. Radio communication between Base X and Misawa is not permitted unless
     deployed assets support it or the Misawa individual is serving a dual role (e.g. CP, SOF).
     Radio communication is authorized to verify HAS sanitation.
     2.7.4. Deployed personnel will use Base X communications and request Base X support
     through the Base X operations center (X-Ray Ops). All communications related to
     regeneration are restricted to the deployed communications equipment and frequencies.
     2.7.5. During recovery and regeneration, use seven digit telephone numbers in lieu of hot
     lines and speed dials.
  2.8. Aircraft Deployment, Recovery and Regeneration.
     2.8.1. Fighter squadrons are responsible for mission planning, coordinating Air Traffic
     Control(ATC) flight plans, and coordinating airspace as directed by their desired time
     line, not to exceed timing dictated in HHQ message. Specific mission events will not be
     evaluated. Any assets coordinated by 35 FW/IGI (e.g. tankers, airspace) will be passed
     via LOI.
     2.8.2. An overall mass briefing will be conducted for the tasked deployment sortie in
     addition to the actual mission to be flown. Squadrons will notify EET of briefing and
     takeoff times.
     2.8.3. Deployment Sorties. Unless tasked otherwise, squadrons may fly local training
     missions during deployment sorties. Aircraft will taxi and takeoff as required to deploy to
     Base X and meet tasking as directed in the deployment message. Non-deployed Misawa
     personnel will perform aircraft launches. Deployed Base X/Y personnel will recover
     aircraft.
35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  19


      2.8.4. Prior to aircraft recovery, applicable shelters will be sanitized/marked with orange
      cones. Aircraft recovering to shelters prior to sanitization will not have maintenance
      performed (except to take Magnetic Chip Detector and Joint Oil Analysis Program
      samples) until sanitization is complete. Utilize HAS cleaning equipment already set up in
      the HAS area. All aircraft covers, missile covers and pins left behind will be utilized as
      Base X assets.
      2.8.5. Upon landing, the aircraft is considered to be at Base X unless the scenario
      dictates otherwise.
      2.8.6. Elephant Walk Procedures. Non-deployed Misawa personnel may perform
      recovery of elephant walk aircraft.
      2.8.7. Base X Aircraft Regeneration. Munitions support for regeneration will occur in the
      pre-designated Base X portion of the Munitions Storage Area. Only deployed personnel
      and equipment will be utilized during the regeneration. This area includes buildings 1441,
      1442, 1443, 1445, 1446 A-S, and 1497. The remainder of the Munitions Storage Area
      (MSA) is deemed joint-use in order to perform out-load functions, deploy subsequent
      munitions UTCs and to support other deploying base agencies’ UTCs. Deployed
      Munitions Control will be located in building 1493 (joint-use facility) and will be
      contacted at 226-3015 to pick up deployed/ processed equipment and will direct the
      regeneration of all aircraft.
      2.8.8. Each aviation unit type code UTC will be limited to the number of vehicles listed
      in the Base X, IGESP. Vehicles will be in place at applicable location prior to the first
      chalk arriving at Base X. If a deployed vehicle has a UHF radio installed, the radio may
      be used immediately upon arrival at Base X. Units will provide a list of vehicles at Base
      X for AMU/FS use and will be limited to the exercise Vehicle Authorization Listing
      (VAL), which is coordinated through 35 LRS/Fleet Management prior to STARTEX.
      Deployed vehicles will be marked with a ribbon or ―joint use‖ placard.
      2.8.9. Tailored WPARR equipment will be considered ―Joint Use‖. Joint use equipment
      will be positioned in a neutral location and marked with blue ribbon. This equipment is
      allowed to be used by both local base Misawa and Base-X personnel for aircraft
      generation and regeneration operations. All equipment processed to meet UTC
      requirements will be identified with red/orange ribbon. Processed equipment may only
      be used for aircraft regeneration and Base-X operations. Any equipment identified as
      host base will be marked with red/orange ribbon and is only available for aircraft and
      personnel at Base-X.
          2.8.9.1. Equipment being used other than as marked (e.g. home-station only
          equipment in-use at Base-X) will be identified as ―damaged‖ and removed from play
          for remainder of shift plus 12 hours.
3. PAUSE-EX Transition.

      conditions and exercise scenarios.
      4.1.2. Personnel in no-play areas will not wear IPE/CWDE and will not respond to alarm
      conditions or other exercise inputs unless directed by EET.
      4.1.3. Single or military married to military parents will carry a MFR signed by their
      Commander or First Sergeant to be released from duty during alarm conditions to
      alleviate child care issues (see Attachment 4). In military-to-military families, only one
      active duty member will be authorized a letter.
      4.1.4. Only those assets deployed to or available at Base X may be used by personnel in
      the Base X play area. The TPFDD will be used in conjunction with the tasking message,
      LOIs, or IGI message traffic to determine what 35 FW equipment is deployed.
   4.2. Transition Area (TA).
      4.2.1. The purpose of the TA is to provide a clearly defined transition from rest to
      exercise participation status, ensure individual readiness, and enhance C2 during a CERE
      or the CERE portion of an ORE.
      4.2.2. TA locations and start times will be identified via a LOI prior to STARTEX.

        shift change/movement is authorized by the CAT.
        4.2.4.5. The TAs are non-play areas. There is no requirement to wear CWDE/IPE or
        react to alarm conditions in the TA.
        4.2.4.6. Personnel traveling by POV to their work centers are non-players until
        arriving at their work center and assuming the appropriate MOPP.
            4.2.4.6.1. Upon arrival at the work center, participants will park the vehicle and
            don CWDE/IPE gear (adjacent to their vehicle).
            4.2.4.6.2. If an Alarm Blue/Red attack is in progress, remain in your vehicle.
            Once Alarm Yellow or Green is sounded, or shift change for your organization is
            authorized, assume appropriate MOPP and enter your work center.
        4.2.4.7. Personnel traveling to their work center by foot, bicycle or bus will be non-
        players while en-route. Upon reaching the work center, assume appropriate MOPP
        within arm’s reach of the building and enter play. If Alarm Blue/Red/Black sounds
        while enroute, personnel may remain in MOPP 0 within arm’s length of the building,
        remain on the bus, or return to the TA.
     4.2.5. Out-processing play area.
        4.2.5.1. When released from duty, personnel will react to all alarm conditions
        between their work center and their vehicle (e.g., if you come under attack on the way
        to your POV, take appropriate duck and cover actions). Personnel will not run to
        POVs in an effort to dodge alarm conditions.
        4.2.5.2. Once within an arm’s length of the POV, personnel are considered non-
        players and may remove IPE/CWDE. Personnel traveling by other than POV may
        remove IPE/CWDE within arm’s reach of their building and become non-players.
     4.2.6. Transition Area Support.
        4.2.6.1. 35 FW/XP will act as AUGFOR manager and provide wing personnel to
        man the TA.

             augmentees have the reporting instructions.
  4.3. Attack Response/Protective Measures.
     4.3.1. Attack response will be in accordance with the 35FW ATSO guide. Participants
     will operate using procedures for the type of facility available at Base X/Y.
     4.3.2. The USAF standard alarm signals will be used for all Fight-in-Place/Base Y
     scenarios. Alarm Blue is used in place of Alarm Red for Base X scenarios.
     4.3.3. Air Base Defense Sectors are depicted in Attachment 4.
  4.4. Contamination Control Area (CCA) / Collective Protection System (CPS).
     4.4.1. The 35 CES Readiness Flight is the OPR for the wing’s CCA/CPS.
     4.4.2. The 35 FW will demonstrate its ability to limit the spread of contamination into a
     toxic free area so personnel can work or obtain rest and relief without wearing individual
     protective equipment.
     4.4.3. AUGFOR will be tasked to provide trained personnel to operate the CCA.
     4.4.4. At the completion of CCA processing, personnel will sign a roster to verify
     processing. The CCA lead will give a copy of all sign-in rosters to EET for validation.
     4.4.5. All contaminated exercise patients will be transported to the DMF or to Bldg 99
     depending on which facility is in-use.
  4.5. Pilot Chemical Warfare Procedures.
     4.5.1. Pilots en route to/from pilot rest may be exempted from ACCA processing with
     Top 3 Coordination, but 35 FW/IGI must be notified of the time and pilot names.

     4.17.1. All aircraft will receive an end of runway (EOR) inspection. EOR inspections
     will not be interrupted for alarm conditions. EOR personnel will not wear field gear or
     gas masks while performing the EOR inspection, but will comply with the directed
     MOPP immediately upon completion.
     4.17.2. Simulated Protective Aircraft Shelters (PAS) walls will be readily identifiable;
     the PAS doors marked with cones, and no more than 45 feet wide. Only one aircraft may
     be parked in a simulated PAS.
     4.17.3. During Base Y and Fight-in-Place scenarios there will be no simulated PAS’
     authorized except as designated by LOI.
     4.17.4. Maintenance may be performed in a secured PAS (real or simulated) during
     Alarm Black, provided powered Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) equipment is not
     being utilized. For any maintenance, all required equipment must have been pre-
     positioned in the PAS prior to the attack. Once Alarm Black is called, the CAT may
     authorize mission essential tasks to continue. If authorized, PAS doors may be opened,
     after local PAR sweep, to the 10-foot mark and powered AGE operations may resume
     (i.e. weapons loading, power on checks, etc.)
  4.18. Sortie Generation - Weapons.
     4.18.1. All weapons loading/unloading activities, simulated actions and simulated loads
     will be recorded in the aircraft’s AFTO Form 781A and 35 MXG Form 45.
     4.18.2. Pilots will annotate the 35 MXG Form 45 with expended munitions following
     each sortie.
     4.18.3. Munitions transport will be demonstrated with a trailer loaded with sufficient
     munitions to reload the entire aircraft and one empty spot. Ribbons will be attached to
     each munitions trailer produced and delivered to the flight line. Trailers used to deliver
     missiles in AUR containers (such as AGM-65/88) may be loaded one container per
     trailer, provided sufficient ribbons are attached to the container to represent a full load.
     4.18.4. Reloads for captive missiles will be demonstrated using half-down/half-up
     procedures. Reloads for all other munitions will use half-up/half-down procedures. Half-
     up/half-down with live munitions is permissible only when like training munitions are not
     already loaded on the aircraft. These procedures will be performed as outlined in the
     2W1X1 CONOPS Book.
     4.18.5. During the reload process (either half-up/half-down or half-down/half-up), load
     crews will remove the appropriate number of ribbons from munitions representing the
     number of weapons simulated loaded. They will then annotate the load on the AFTO
     Form 781A and MXG Form 45.
     4.18.6. Station #9 is used for captive air training missile (CATM)-120 reloads and
     station #3 is used for CATM-88 and TGM/CATM-65 reloads regardless of pilot reported
     expenditures.

     4.18.7. Guns are reloaded when the system falls below 50 percent capacity based on
     simulated usage reported by the pilot or EET input. During simulated reloads of ammo,
     the universal ammunition loading system (UALS) or linkless ammunition loading system
     (LALS) will be connected to the aircraft and a full belt of ammo will be run through the
     UALS/LALS in bypass. When the load is complete, UALS/LALS forms documentation
     is required. Ammo will not be removed from storage nor will rounds be removed from
     the aircraft if loaded.
     4.18.8. Upon each weapons reload, the weapons expeditor will enter the
     loading/unloading information on an AF Form 2434 for simulated expenditures and a
     separate AF Form 2434 for actual expenditures. CAS will be updated per AFI 21-201.
     4.18.9. Trailers that have had their ribbons removed, simulating all munitions were used
     to generate aircraft, will be returned to the MSA and re-supplied at the
     production/processing facility or storage location before reuse. If for any reason
     munitions were not expended and downloaded, the ribbons will be reattached to the
     trailer.
     4.18.10. After firing inspection requirements; aircraft -6 inspections will be performed
     on all stations that fired. Tools, technical data and expendables will be available at each
     aircraft for all simulated firings. If an after fire inspection must be performed on a station
     that has a simulated munitions loaded, download procedures must be accomplished prior
     to performing inspection. After fire inspections will be performed for simulated
     and/actual launching/firing/releasing of munitions, gun and alternate mission equipment
     (AME.) To simulate inspections:
        4.18.10.1. Personnel will remain at the aircraft for amount of time required to
        perform the appropriate inspections/maintenance (time based on 1 individual
        performing after fire inspection):
            4.18.10.1.1. MAU-12, 10 minutes per station.
            4.18.10.1.2. TER-9, 15 minutes per station.
            4.18.10.1.3. LAU-117/118/129, 10 minutes per station.

  4.19. Sortie Generation – Munitions.
     4.19.1. Simulated combat pre-issue inspection procedures will be used. Munitions and
     components with service/shelf life restrictions or hermetically sealed containers will not
     be opened with the exception of impulse cartridges. Hermetically sealed components will
     be delivered to the buildup area, but will not be installed on assembled munitions.
     Instead, use inert munitions of the same type to demonstrate the tasks involved. These
     inert components will be removed from assembled munitions prior to delivery to the
     flight line.
     4.19.2. Re-supply capability will be demonstrated by breakout and delivery of munitions
     from storage locations and delivered to production sites. Half of these munitions will be
28                                                       35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011


     off-loaded and uploaded from/to the transport vehicle at the production site, then returned
     to the storage location where half will be off-loaded/uploaded to demonstrate continued
     re-supply, if required. Production sites may use inert munitions and components to
     demonstrate assembly and trailer loading capability using half-up/half-down procedures.
     Additionally, munitions breakout and production sites may use half-up/half-down
     procedures at storage locations and production sites to show capability to load/unload
     vehicles transporting/delivering munitions and components.
  4.20. Sortie Generation - Fuel Tanks.
     4.20.1. Up to 25 percent of the daily sorties will have simulated expended tanks. Pilots,
     per EET inject, will annotate the 35 MXG Form 45 with expended fuel tanks following a
     sortie.
     4.20.2. If the turn time is tight, the Pro Super may authorize streamlined leak and transfer
     procedures. Comply with all normal tank down-loading/up-loading procedures except
     for fuel transfer check. Individual AFTO Form 781A entries will be made for tank
     jettison checks, leak check and fuel indication/transfer check. The tank jettison check
     must be completed prior to installing impulse carts. The crew chief will comply with
     external leak check upon engine start. The pilot will confirm tank indication and
     operation (feeding) prior to takeoff and clear the forms after flight.
     4.20.3. Upon notification of simulated fuel tank expenditures, maintenance shall
     requisition replacement tanks through supply. Host base supply will simulate delivery to
     the tank farm or HAS.
     4.20.4. Maintenance will download and replace one fuel tank to simulate the replacement
     of all jettisoned tanks. However, all required replacement fuel tanks, personnel, support
     equipment, tools, and consumables shall be available at the aircraft for the actual
     replacement period.
  4.21. Sortie Generation – Halon.
     4.21.1. 20 percent of all aircraft halon bottles will be replaced with a simulated full bottle
     prior to the next flight. Pilots will annotate the 35 MXG Form 45 with expended halon
     following a sortie. Maintenance actions will be documented in aircraft’s AFTO Form
     781A.
  4.22. Sortie Generation – Fuels.
     4.22.1. Base X will be supported by one de-fueling unit, four hot pits and all but four
     refueling units (these are used for real world). Additionally, eighteen fuels personnel will
     be assigned to handle 24-hour Base X operations. Two flight line expediters will be
     available for day and night shifts.
     4.22.2. During fight-in-place/Base Y scenarios, all 35 FW POL assets are considered
     available.
  4.23. CANN Jets.
     4.23.1. Upon a required cannibalization action at Base X, a deployed CANN aircraft will
     be identified to the maintenance operations center (MOC) and MXG EET. After
     identification, parts may be removed from the Misawa CANN aircraft as if it were at
35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                29


     Base X. Once a part is removed, the Base X CANN aircraft will carry the appropriate
     simulated aircraft status and will not be able available IAW PACAF simulation 1.6
     ―Cannibalization to Fill Spares Requirements for Deploying Units. As parts are received
     from 35 LRS, and the appropriate time has lapsed for part replacement and operational
     checks, the aircraft status may be changed.
  4.24. Nestable Fuel Tank Build-up (NFTBU).
     4.24.1. Units must demonstrate the capability to successfully de-nest all equipment/tanks
     and establish their work areas. The requirement will be to build two 370-gallon tanks in
     12 hours, including training time for augmentees, to accomplish the requirements of
     contingency tasking. Within the 12-hour time limit, training tanks must pass a pressure
     check IAW technical data. Training tanks will be used to demonstrate build-up capability
     but will not be loaded, fueled, or flown on aircraft. Real-world WRM assets will not be
     utilized for build-up demonstrations unless authorized by HQ PACAF. 35 FW/IGI and
     EET should select six (6) NFTBU team members.
     4.24.2. Equipment expected to be available at Base X may be used. A list of all
     personnel and equipment involved will be provided to EET prior to the start of the
     evaluation.
     4.24.3. The evaluation will be performed at a location designated by the 35 MXS/CC and
     run for not more than 12 hours. The start of the evaluation will be determined by Fuel
     Systems Repair and will occur during the transition period between IRRE and CERE
     operations. Fuel System Repair must contact EET one (1) hour prior to the evaluation to
     allow for evaluator coordination. The tank build-up team should be ready to open the
     canister at the initiation of the evaluation. The maintenance floor will be cleared of all
     partially assembled tanks before commencing the evaluation. The criteria listed below
     will be used to evaluate WRM tank build-up:
        4.24.3.1. The ability to build serviceable WRM tanks to meet the MISCAP
        statement.
        4.24.3.2. Adequacy of local planning and effectiveness of NFTBU training plans to
        integrate augmentees into a build-up function.
        4.24.3.3. The technical proficiency and training of fuel systems technicians on all
        facets of NFTBU.
        4.24.3.4. Adequacy and serviceability of equipment, by type and quantity, as outlined
        in the logistic detail to support required build-up rates.
        4.24.3.5. Sufficiency of bench stock items to replace only the items that have a high
        probability of being damaged during tank assembly.
        4.24.3.6. The availability of sufficient quantities of trained fuel systems technicians
        to support tasking.
        4.24.3.7. Use, currency, and adequacy of the safety briefing and technical data.
 30                                                       35FWI90-201 18 NOVEMBER 2011


   4.25. Elephant Walk.
      4.25.1. Following word from MADDOG to initiate Elephant Walk procedures, pilots
      will taxi to the appropriate runway, hold at EOR, and return as coordinated between OG
      CC and MXG CC.
      4.25.2. For pilots given an EET inject to simulate an airborne or ground emergency after
      landing, the pilot /aircraft will remain at de-arm/EOR with speed brakes open, and chocks
      installed. All other flight members continue elephant walk taxiing back to HAS.
      Recovery and regeneration actions can begin immediately since personnel would not
      normally show for base X recovery until just prior to landing and to wait for ―normal‖
      flight time would cut into the duty day. The estimated sortie duration will be added to the
      regeneration time for scoring purposes.
5. Wing Inspections & Exercise Evaluation Team (EET)
   5.1. 35 FW/IGI is responsible for conducting exercises on behalf of the 35FW/CC to

         area EET team leads and will normally be scheduled for the two hours after ENDEX.
         The purpose of this meeting is to facilitate the flow of information between EET
         members, helping to build the ―big picture‖ of what happened and to help identify
         wing wide trends.
         5.10.1.2. A Wing Out brief will be scheduled for all IRREs/CEREs/OREs/EMEs.
         This will be held in the Wing Conference Room/Command Post and will give the 35
         FW/IG an opportunity to present all inputs to the 35 FW/CC and unit commanders for
         discussion prior to publishing the report. All Group EET leads should also attend the
         out brief.
  5.11. Reporting Exercise Deficiencies.
     5.11.1. All wing deficiencies should be reported to IGI via the evaluation report as
     directed by 35 FW/IGI. EET members should gather all facts concerning the deficiency
     and try to ascertain what the root problem is. Findings should be submitted highlighting
     the root cause, with various symptoms (observation) listed as sub-bullets. Unit EET will
     brief all exercise write-ups to the unit commander before the exercise out-brief.
     5.11.2. Validate all write-ups with affected units as soon as possible. Face-to-face
     validation is preferred but not required. Validation is accomplished through open and
     frank discussions between the EET and inspected units.

      5.12.1. Superior Performer nominations are used to recognize individuals in the top 1%
      of exercises participants. Evaluators should submit nominations to the group level for
      validation. Group commanders will select superior performers for recognition and
      forward to 35FW/IGI for inclusion in the out brief and final report. Base the number of
      superior performers on 1% of Group personnel on-station during the exercise.
          5.12.1.1. Outstanding teams should be nominated to the Group level in the same
          manner as individual performers. Teams which achieve benchmark or ―best seen to
          date‖ levels of performance qualify. Group Commanders select a maximum of 1
          outstanding team per exercise.
      5.12.2. Strengths should identify mission areas that clearly exceed establish standards for
      efficiency, speed or effectiveness. OPR/OCR not required.
      5.12.3. Deficiencies. An observation is a deficiency if it involves a failure to comply
      with AFI, failure of a critical process, a major safety violation, is a repeat write-up or
      requires higher headquarters involvement. Evaluators must cite the governing
      instruction/regulation. An OPR is required; if the 35 FW/CC is designated as the OPR an
      OCR is also required.
      5.12.4. Recommended Improvement Area (RIA). An RIA is recommendation to improve
      the efficiency of a particular area.
