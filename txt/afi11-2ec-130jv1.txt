1.1. General. This instruction provides for training management of EC-130J aircrew members.
Training policy, guidance, and requirements are set forth for each phase of aircrew training.
Training is designed to progressively develop the combat readiness of each aircrew member,
while maintaining previously acquired proficiency. For the ANG portions of this AFI, the term
―MAJCOM‖ is understood to be either AFSOC or National Guard Bureau (NGB) as noted.
   1.1.1. Qualification Training (Chapter 2) qualifies aircrew members for basic, nontactical
   aircrew duties.
   1.1.2. Mission Qualification Training (Chapter 3) qualifies aircrew members in an assigned
   crew position for a specific aircraft, to perform the command or their unit mission.
   1.1.3. Continuation Training (Chapter 4) provides the capability for aircrew members to
   reinforce and build upon previous training and conduct Air Force Task List (AFTL), United
   States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Joint Mission Essential Tasks (JMETs),
   and MAJCOM Mission Essential Task (METs) based, combat-oriented aircrew training.
   1.1.4. Upgrade/Specialized Training (Chapter 5) upgrades Mission Pilots (MP) to Mission
   Pilot Aircraft commanders (MPA) and all aircrew members to instructor and flight examiner
   status. It also provides aircrew members training leading to special mission event
   qualification or certification.
1.2. Training Objective. The overall objective of the aircrew training program is to develop
and maintain a high state of mission readiness, facilitating immediate and effective employment
in exercises, contingencies, limited war, and general war operations.
   1.2.1. The training program must train aircrew in the skills, knowledge, and attitudes (SKA)
   required in accomplishing assigned missions. Regulatory/directive and authoritative sources
   of required information include but may not be limited to AFI 11-202, Vol. 3, General Flight
   Rules, MAJCOM guidance, Mission Design Series (MDS)-specific instructions (AFI 11-
   2EC-130J, Vol. 3, EC-130J Operations Procedures), FARs, ICAO SARPs, FLIP, FCG,
   NOTAMS, T.O.s, ATC instructions, and AFTTP 3-1.
       1.2.1.1. Commando Solo. The AFTTP 3-3, Commando Solo, Combat Aircraft
       Fundamentals EC-130J, provides the authoritative, standardized, and fundamental
       tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) for tactical employment of the EC-130J. This
       document is the primary source of combat aircraft fundamentals and FTU mission
       qualification courseware and instruction. The AFTTP 3-1, Commando Solo, EC-130J ,
       provides classified and advanced, combat-/threat-driven TTP.

     proficiency. Complete and sign off all required training items prior to recommending the
     student for an evaluation or certifing the student in a manuever or procedure.
     1.3.10.5. Each instructor aircrew member is responsible for the safe execution of the
     duties of their respective crew position. At any time during the flight, if the judgment or
     proficiency of the student should raise a question in the instructor‘s mind as to the
     student‘s ability to safely execute the duties of the aircrew position, the instructor will
     immediately take over these duties. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate
     the proper method of executing these duties. Instructors must be highly knowledgeable
     in EC-130J TTP and governing AFIs to provide immediate instruction to any crew
     position concerning weapon system employment and regulatory and non-regulatory
     guidance.
     1.3.10.6. Instructor pilots are responsible at all times for the conduct of the flight and
     safety of the aircraft. At any time during the flight, if the judgment or proficiency of the
     student at the controls raises a question in the instructor pilot‘s mind as to the student‘s
     ability to safely complete a prescribed maneuver, the instructor pilot will immediately
     take over the controls of the aircraft. The instructor pilot should then explain and
     demonstrate proper methods of conducting the maneuver prior to the student resuming
     control of the aircraft. All instructors will place special emphasis on the procedures for
     positive identification of emergency conditions before initiating corrective action. In
     addition, instructors will place a high emphasis on the procedures for positive exchange
     of control; these procedures will be thoroughly briefed.
     1.3.10.7. Instructors who demonstrate deficiencies in their ability to instruct may be used
     in their primary crew position (provided the deficiency does not involve primary crew
     duties). Commanders will take the necessary action to either retrain or remove those
     individuals from instructor status IAW Air Force or MAJCOM directives.

1.4. Aircrew Training Policy. The primary training method for EC-130J initial qualification,
requalification, or upgrade training is attendance at an ETCA formal school. USAF policy
dictates the use of formal schools unless attendance is impractical. The secondary method is in-
unit training, using applicable formal school courseware. Secondary method training (SMT)
requires a waiver be submitted through appropriate channels per this instruction and approved by
NGB/A3O, courtesy copy AFSOC/A3T. (Note: Formal schools will not forward written
examinations as part of the courseware for in-unit qualification training.) Any aircrew member
who was previously dis-enrolled from a formal ETCA course for substandard performance is
ineligible for a secondary method training waiver. 193 FTU is the primary source for formal
training products. When specific formal courseware is not published, use of locally developed
training syllabi can be authorized. Units will forward all locally developed syllabi for in-unit
training to NGB/A3O for review and approval. All locally approved in-unit SOIs are posted on
the 193 Tactics and Training CoP.
       1.4.1.1. Formal School courseware requests. For SMT, the waiver authority (per Table
       1.1) will include the appropriate formal school as an addressee on all correspondence and
       will request that the formal school forward applicable courseware to the 193 FTU.
       Courseware includes but is not limited to; the course syllaus, briefings, Computer Based
       Training (CBT) modules, student and instructor guides, and training guides and grade
       sheets for the student‘s training folder. The FTU will verify the current version is used.
       1.4.1.2. Complete all academic, ground, and flight training outlined in the courseware.
       When the courseware is adapted for local use, modify it only if the training is
       incompatible with local training conditions; i.e., no simulators.
       1.4.1.3. NGB/A3O approved differences training may be conducted in unit without a
       waiver.
       1.4.1.4. Units conducting training where a waiver is not required (i.e., complete training
       for restricted AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, or NGB/A3O approved
       differences training) will send a request for any applicable courseware through channels
       to NGB/A3O, with an information copy to the appropriate formal school. Include unit
       point of contact (name, rank, office symbol, and telephone number) and the name and
       rank of the individual who will receive the training.
   1.4.2. Training Forms. Aircrew training records and forms will be established and
   maintained per Chapter 6 of this instruction.
       1.4.2.1. AF Form 4348, USAF Certification of Aircrew Training. Used to document
       ground/flying training associated with mission qualification, and to document instructor
       certified and one-time/initial flying training events. The AF Form 4348 is maintained in
AFI11-2EC-130JV1 15 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                            13


     the individual‘s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) per AFI 11-202, Vol. 2, Aircrew
     Standardization /Evaluation Program.
     1.4.2.2. The following forms aid management of aircrew training programs.
         1.4.2.2.1. AF Form 4109, SOF/CSAR Training Record. Used as the training record
         jacket to document in-unit qualification or upgrade of an aircrew member. It
         documents applicable ground training, special function training, part task training,
         cockpit procedures training, simulator training, and flying training accomplished by
         aircrew members.
         1.4.2.2.2. AF Form 4110, Comments – SOF/CSAR Training Record.                  Used to
         document narrative comments on aircrew training activities.
         1.4.2.2.3. AF Form 4111, SOF/CSAR Training Record. Used to list required
         proficiency levels (RPL), indicate events for training sortie completion, and to
         document demonstrated student task and subtask performance and knowledge
         proficiency levels. Units are authorized to overprint and reproduce AF Form 4111 for
         approved course syllabi. The number of training tasks in the appropriate training
         guide is a recommended minimum, which normally allows the student to achieve
         proficiency. It is neither intended to restrict the number of times the task must be
         accomplished nor restrict proficiency advancement.
     1.4.2.3. IAW the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP), personnel in AFSC
     1AXXX are exempt from maintaining OJT Training Folders (AF Form 623).
     1.4.2.4. For Weapons Instructor Course (WIC), prepare training records IAW USAFWS
     guidance.
  1.4.3. Aircrew Training While DNIF. Aircrew members whose status is ―duty not involving
  flying‖ (DNIF) may log ground training events, including simulator training, if the member‘s
  physical condition allows. Consult the flight surgeon initiating AF Form 1042, Medical
  Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty, action if the DNIF status includes
  ground training limitations.
  1.4.4. In-flight Supervision. Unless specifically directed, the unit commander determines
  the level of supervision necessary to accomplish required training. If the mission objectives
  include introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, then an
  instructor may be required. The following personnel must be supervised by an instructor
  from a like crew position when performing aircrew duties.
     1.4.4.1. Non-current aircrew members.
     1.4.4.2. Aircrew members in initial, difference, upgrade, or requalification flying
     training.
     1.4.4.3. Senior officers who have not completed initial qualification as outlined in
     Chapter 2 and as outlined in paragraph 1.7.
  1.4.5. Cross Crew Position Training (CCPT). With unit commander, operations officer, or
  mission commander approval, instructors from one crew position may train aircrew members
  from a different crew position on events in which both are qualified (as long as the instructor
  is not performing duties as a primary aircrew member at the time) unless otherwise restricted

   in this volume. Flight evaluations must comply with requirements of AFI 11-2EC-130J, Vol.
   2, EC-130J Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
1.5. Service Commitments. Formal training, either primary or secondary method, conducted
per this instruction may incur a service commitment IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service
Commitments (ADSC), Reserve Duty Service Commitment; AFRCI 36-2102, Air Force Reserve
Service Commitment Date or Air National Guard Service Agreement. Reference the appropriate
AFI for program specifics. Individuals will acknowledge the incurred SC by signing the
appropriate Service Commitment Acknowledgement Statement, prior to entering training.
The FTU will notify AFPC/DPSFO via the servicing MPF once training is complete.
1.6. Waivers: Unless otherwise specified AF/A3O-A is the waiver authority for this
instruction. EXCEPTION: MAJCOM/A3 or NGB/A3O is the waiver authority for individual
aircrew requirements, but may not approve blanket or group (two or more aircrew) waivers. For
case-by-case individual waivers for flight physical and physiological training currencies,
AFSOC/SGP and AFMSA/SG3P are the respective waiver authorities. Some ground training
items (e.g. small arms training, LOAC, etc.) are tasked by other agencies. Reference the source
instruction to determine the waiver authority in these cases. Waiver authority for suplimental
guidance will be specified in the supplement and approved through higher level coordination
authority.

  present crew position (including special mission qualifications), total flying time and primary
  aircraft assigned (PAA) time (including instructor and evaluator time, if applicable) and
  justification, crew qualification to which member is qualifying or upgrading, scheduled
  training start date, expected upgrade or qualification date, date last event accomplished,
  remarks, and requesting unit point of contact (include name, rank, telephone number, and
  office symbol). Waiver format templates are available on the AFSOC/A3T website,
  https://www.afsoc.af.mil/milonly/a3t/A3T_home.htm, or training Community of Practice
  (CoP), https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-OP-SO-12
  1.6.3. Units requesting waivers for SMT in-unit qualifiction, mission qualification, or
  upgrade of an aircrew member will send requests through appropriate channels to NGB/A3O.
  Formal schools will forward current copies of courseware materials to units semiannually.
  Maintain copies of all waivers in the individual‘s training folder. If the training incurs an
  ADSC per paragragh 1.5., include the statement ―Individual acknowledged receipt of ADSC
  by signing the AF Form 63 on <date AF Form 63 signed>.
  1.6.4. Operations Group commander or equivalent (e.g. CJSOAC/CC) may:
     1.6.4.1. Waive 10 percent of the total and PAA hours required for upgrade in all crew
     positions, on an individual basis only. A copy of the waiver must be filed in the
     individual‘s training record. Students attending formal school will bring a waiver letter
     to the formal school for insertion into their training record.
     1.6.4.2. Extend ground training requirement due dates up to 2 months for Table 4.3
     Exception: Items referenced in paragraph 1.6. levied by other AFIs may not be waived
     by the OG unless specifically authorized to do so in the source AFI. These events may
     count towards the next periodic requirements (units should note on waiver when events
     were accomplished and the ARMS due date should be updated).
     1.6.4.3. Extend due dates for the duration of an exercise, contingency or operational
     mission for Table 4.3. events on an individual basis only if a aircrew member goes
     overdue while away from home station and the training is not available at the deployed
     location. Exception: Items referenced in paragraph 1.6. levied by other AFIs may not be
     waived by the OG unless specifically authorized to do so in the source AFI.
     1.6.4.4. Waive all flying training requirements (Table 4.4 and Table 4.5) except as
     otherwise noted) on an individual basis only. Wings/groups must keep an accurate record
     of waivers granted. Notify NGB/A3O and AFSOC/A3T when waivers are issued.

   1.6.5. Unit commanders may carry new aircrew members as ―mission ready‖ (MR) for up to
   six months if an aircrew member arrives at the unit after a PCS or formal school and is not
   MR in all core mission events. Units must notify AFSOC/A3T and NGB/A3O of any OG
   extensions. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform events in which they are not
   qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. This policy does not apply to
   basic aircraft qualification events. If training is not complete in six months, the aircrew
   member becomes ―non-mission ready‖ (NMR). Squadrons will have six months from the
   time a new core mission event is added and MAJCOM guidance issued to train and qualify
   aircrew in the new event.
1.7. Senior Officer Flying/Supervisory Aircrew. See AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, AFSOC Sup.
1.8. Intra-command and Inter-command Transfer of Aircrews. For intra-command transfer
of aircrew members, the gaining organization will honor validated training completed by newly
assigned aircrew members prior to the transfer. For inter-command transfer, certifications and
qualifications should be accepted to the maximum extent practical, as long as training and
evaluation standards are equivalent. The operations officer at the gaining unit should review the
individual's career training folder and flight evaluation folder to determine which certifications
and qualifications will be honored. Aircrew members qualified in the same MDS are considered
qualified in that equipment throughout the force when used for the same mission.
   1.8.1. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Screening. Losing units will screen individual
   flight and ground training records during unit out-processing. Accomplish this screening in
   sufficient time to correct discrepancies prior to PCS. Losing unit will provide a printed copy
   of current ground and flying training summaries to individuals prior to PCS. See AFI 11-
   401, Aviation Management, for additional guidance.
   1.8.2. Instructor training and qualifications may be accepted at the discretion of the gaining
   unit commander.
1.9. Initial Cadre for Change of Aircraft, Equipment, or Capability. When possible,
qualified personnel in other units operating like equipment will provide the initial cadre. In some
instances, it will be necessary for units converting from one design aircraft to another to form an
initial cadre of aircrew personnel for whom certain training qualification requirements may be
waived. Authorization to form initial cadre crews will be contained in the conversion program
action directive. Unless otherwise stated in the program action directive, the following
conditions will apply to management of initial cadre aircrew qualification for aircraft conversion:
   1.9.1. A nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) will be formed to
   begin aircrew training. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than
   currently held; for example, EC-130E IP to EC-130J flight examiner. See AFI 11-202
   Volume 2, initial instructor evaluation, for evaluation requirements.
   1.9.2. Units send proposed initial cadre list by name, rank, current crew position and aircraft,
   total flying time, and requested crew qualification level through channels to AFSOC/A3 and
   NGB/A3O for approval.
       1.9.2.1. Following final approval, publish a squadron letter to identify initial cadre
       instructors and flight examiners by aircraft and crew qualification and file in each cadre
       individual‘s FEF (Tab 2).
AFI11-2EC-130JV1 15 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               17


       1.9.2.2. If a check ride was accomplished, enter appropriate comments in the remarks
       section of AF Form 8 explaining the individual‘s status as initial cadre instructor or flight
       examiner.
   1.9.3. Initial cadre is not required for minor aircraft modifications when any required
   training for that modification is provided by the contractor and/or can easily be accomplished
   in-unit. Conduct differences training for the new equipment and log training on the letter of
   Xs or Memo for Record (MFR). Aircrew members will not fly with new equipment until
   trained.
1.10. Unit Aircrew Capability. Squadrons will maintain mission ready status on all primary
aircrew members up to unit authorizations. Commanders will train aircrews to meet capabilities
specified in unit DOC statements. Supervisory aircrew and staff members assigned above
squadron level, which are in excess of the unit‘s mission requirements, will maintain mission
ready, basic mission capable, or basic aircraft qualification status, as required. Note: To change
from BMC to MR status, a aircrew member will begin maintaining full MR flying currency. The
unit commander may assign additional training, as desired.
   1.10.1. Commanders will not assign additional duties to first assignment ―pipeline‖ (directly
   out of formal MDS training) aircrew members (officer and enlisted) for their first 6 months
   in the unit. First assignment aircrew members in any AFSOC weapon system should not be
   given an additional duty for the first 6 months in the unit. This policy allows pipeline
   students to learn the weapon system without distraction of an additional duty; however, first
   assignment senior personnel may be assigned additional duties.
   1.10.2. Aircrew members will not perform long term duties which detract from the primary
   duties of training for, or performing the unit flying mission.
   1.10.3. ACC Currency Requirements. Permanent Party aircrew assigned to the 34 WPS
   USAFWS instructors must maintain at least basic mission capable flying currency in the
   portions of the mission they will instruct. Unit commanders may direct specific individuals
   to maintain only partial BMC qualifications. In such cases, the aircrew member will require
   only those currency items associated with this tailored qualification. The individual‘s AF
   Form 8 will indicate applicable restrictions based on assignments of less than full mission
   qualification. If 34 WPS aircrew members augment operational units, the gaining unit
   commander must be provided a detailed list of the individual‘s current training status. The
   individual must comply with MR training requirements of the gaining unit or pursue
   applicable waivers through the operational unit‘s MAJCOM/A3. The gaining unit or
   MAJCOM may levy additional requirements as desired. Chapter 4 outlines exceptions to
   continuation currency training requirements for these personnel. Note: For the purposes of
   this instruction, enlisted aircrew members assigned to the 34 WPS are not considered
   USAFWS instructors.
1.11. Changes. Recommendations for improvement to this instruction are encouraged. Send
recommendations to 193 OSF/OST, on an AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication. 193 OSF/OST will coordinate all changes through 193 OG/OGV and AFSOC/A3T.
AF/A3 is the approval authority for interim changes to this instruction.
   1.11.1. AFSOC/A3 and NGB/A3 will determine training requirements for subordinate units.
   AFI changes will be issued via revision, Interim Change (IC), or Administrative Change

   requirements and currencies may be altered regularly. These training requirement and
   currency adjustments may be made via RAP (Ready Aircrew Program) Tasking
   Memorandum. AFSOC/A3 will be an info addressee on all changes.
1.12. Deviations. This instruction does not authorize deviations from the flight manual or any
other Air Force Instruction. Flight safety will be given prime consideration and must take
precedence over the requirements and guidance of this instruction.
1.13. Publication Administration. This instruction is distributed to ACC, AETC, AFRC,
AFSOC, ANG, AFSOC-gained units, and AFSOC related schools based on requirements
established through the Publications Distribution Office (PDO). All aircrew members are
authorized this instruction. Distribution to units, organizations, and individuals outside these
commands or not associated with the MDS may be made upon specific request and justification.
   1.13.1. Supplements. Forward all unit or MAJCOM supplements to this instruction to
   AFSOC/A3TA, who in turn will forward to USAF/A3O-AT for approval. Provide
   AFSOC/A3TA, and applicable MAJCOM a copy of all approved supplements. If required
   by mission or location, units may supplement this instruction by coordinating with
   AFSOC/A3T before publication.

                                            Chapter 2

                                QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. Overview. This chapter outlines the minimum requirements for Basic Aircraft
Qualification (BAQ) training which may be completed via initial qualification, requalification,
conversion, or differences training. Duties not directly related to qualification or requalification
training should be minimized.
   2.1.1. Qualification training provides the training necessary to initially qualify aircrew
   members in a basic crew position and flying duties without regard to the unit‘s mission.
   Upon completion of qualification training, the aircrew member attains BAQ status. BAQ is a
   prerequisite for Mission Qualification Training (outlined in Chapter 3).
2.2. General Requirements. The primary method of initial qualification and requalification
training is the appropriate formal training course listed in the ETCA. If no requalification course
exists, conduct requalification using the initial qualification course. Completing the appropriate
formal course satisfies the training requirements of this chapter. When attendance is not
practical or quotas are not available, units may request secondary method in-unit qualification
training waivers IAW paragraph 1.4.1. Any aircrew member who has previously failed to
successfully complete the ETCA formal course for substandard performance will not be issued a
secondary method training waiver.
2.3. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate formal course
syllabus, the ETCA, AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, and this instruction. The formal school SOI designates
the course prerequisite approval authority.
2.4. Ground Training Requirements. All aircrew members must complete ground training
requirements IAW Table 2.1, prior to the first flight. See Chapter 4 for event descriptions.

Table 2.1. Basic Aircraft Qualification Ground Training Requirements.

 Note: See AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, AFSOC Sup for Flight Surgeon (FS), Medical Technician, and
 Combat Camera Aerial Photographer Training requirements.
   2.4.1. Written Examination. Open and closed book qualification examinations must be
   completed before the completion of basic qualification flying training. Written examinations
   must satisfy the requirements of AFI 11-202, Vol. 2 and MDS Vol. 2. The formal school
 20                                                AFI11-2EC-130JV1 15 SEPTEMBER 2011


   will not forward their examinations as part of the courseware for in-unit qualifications.
   When qualification training is completed by secondary method, the student will complete the
   appropriate group stan/eval or equivalent examination.
   2.4.2. Emergency Egress Training, Non-ejection [LL03]. All aircrew members and other
   personnel regularly flying on AFSOC aircraft will receive hands-on egress training in the
   aircraft prior to their first flight.
       2.4.2.1. All C-130 egress training will include opening the crew entrance door, a
       paratroop door, an emergency escape hatch, a pilot‘s swing window, and the ramp and
       door. A current and qualified LM is required to be present during opening of the ramp
       and door. Aircrew members must be given flight deck and cargo compartment
       familiarization. Place emphasis on the location and function of all switches and controls,
       AFE equipment, and emergency equipment required for all emergency procedures.
       Bailout, forced landing and ditching, and emergency ground egress procedures are
       required to be briefed during this training.
2.5. Flying Training Requirements. Satisfactorily completing the appropriate ETCA formal
course satisfies the requirements of this section. Approved in-unit qualification training must be
accomplished IAW applicable formal school courseware and the guidance below:
   2.5.1. Flying training lessons should be completed sequentially. If mission scheduling or
   student progress dictates otherwise, in-unit training sequences may be changed by the unit
   Operations Officer.
   2.5.2. Aircrew member upgrade and special qualification training requirements may be
   completed on training or operational missions under the supervision of an instructor in the
   same aircrew position. Comply with restrictions in AFI 11-2EC-130J, Vol. 3.
2.6. Basic Aircraft Qualification Conversion/Differences Training. Conversion training is
normally associated with training between MDS (e.g. C-21 to C-130). Difference training is
conducted when training in a different series aircraft in the same mission design (e.g. C-130E to
C-130H3). Use difference training when changing between same design aircraft and the amount
of training needed for qualification does not warrant attendance at a formal qualification course.
Additionally, accomplish difference training when an aircraft is modified and any required
training for that modification can easily be accomplished in-unit. BAQ difference training
qualifies an aircrew member to be a basic aircrew member. Primary method for differences
training is via completion of a formal school transition course (TX). If a TX course is not
available, the alternate method is via in unit ground and flight training IAW MAJCOM/A3T
approved AF Form 4111, satisfactory completion of the qualification written open/closed
examinations, and instructor certification on the AF Form 4348 for the new aircraft. Aircrew
members entered into differences training will complete training within 180 days (12 months for
AFRC and ANG) after the first flight of the training program. BAQ Differences training is
authorized per Table 2.2
2.6.1. For basic aircraft instrument/qualification purposes, the EC-130J, C-130J, MC-130J, and
C-130J-30 are considered to be the same mission design. Training between the C-130J variants
and any other C-130 variant is conversion training and will be accomplished via a formal course
at an FTU or via SMT.
AFI11-2EC-130JV1 15 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                          21


   2.6.2. Upon completion of differences training and certification on the AF Form 4348, the
   aircrew member is Basic Aircraft Qualified (BAQ) in the new aircraft. Aircrew members
   may maintain previous C-130 instructor/evaluator, air-to-air refueling (AAR) and Maximum
   Effort qualifications at the discretion of the unit commander. Other crew position
   qualifications (i.e. mission instructor) are attained through the procedures in Chapter 5.
   2.6.3. Aircrew members training to an MDS, not specifically listed in paragraph 2.6. or
   Table 2.2 must complete conversion training. Conversion training requires the completion
   of the formal school initial qualification course.
   2.6.4. Multiple Qualification. Aircrew members will attend a formal initial qualification or
   TX course to gain basic aircraft qualification in another MDS unless authorized difference
   training per paragraph 2.6. For approved secondary method training, request courseware
   IAW paragraph 1.4.

                                           Chapter 3

                     MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT)

3.1. Overview. This chapter establishes the minimum training requirements for completing
mission qualification and requalification. Aircrew members completing mission qualification or
requalification will meet the requirements of this chapter. Upon completion of mission
qualification training, the aircrew member will be assigned either Basic Mission Capable (BMC)
or Mission Ready (MR) status.
3.2. General Requirements. The primary method of mission qualification is to complete the
appropriate formal training course listed in the ETCA. When attendance is not practical or
quotas are not available, units may request waivers to conduct secondary method mission
qualification training using formal school courseware. The secondary method requires use of
formal school courseware and a waiver from the appropriate waiver authority as listed in Table
1.1 This courseware establishes the minimum training requirements to meet standards specified
in AFI 11-2EC-130J, Vol. 2. Units may supplement courseware to meet local requirements.
Submit all courseware change requests to NGB/A3O prior to implementation.
3.3. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate formal course
syllabus, the ETCA, AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, and this instruction. The formal school SOI designates
the course prerequisite approval authority.
   3.3.1. This does not preclude simultaneous basic qualification and mission qualification
   training. Simultaneous/Concurrent Multiple-MDS qualification upgrades will not be
   accomplished.
   3.3.2. If there is not a separate mission requalification course, aircrew members requalifying
   in the units mission will comply with the initial mission qualification course prerequisites.
   3.3.3. For the minimum requirements to be trained as a Mission Pilot (MP) refer to Table
   5.1 If the requirements of the table are not met, train and evaluate the individual as a MC
   unless excepted below.
       3.3.3.1. Prior Qualified Pilots (PQP, e.g. FAIP, OSA, etc.) with at least 800 hours total
       flying time will be trained in the left seat and evaluated as a MP. PQP pilots trained as an
       MP with less than the required C-130 experience will fly in-unit as an MP until they have
       the required PMAI flight time. Units will follow Requalification procedures in Chapter 4
       to requal those pilots as MPs.
       3.3.3.2. Prior Qualified Pilots (PQP, e.g. FAIP, OSA, etc.) with less than 800 hours total
       flying time will be trained and evaluated as an MC.
3.4. Ground Training Requirements. Complete all ground training in Table 3.1 as part of
mission qualification training or prior to certifying individuals as mission ready. Completion of
training will establish due dates for recurring ground training required in Chapter 4. Credit any
training accomplished at a formal school. Qualified mission ready aircrew members transferred
from other units require only unit specific mission ready training events or events which are
due/overdue.

   3.4.1. Academic Training. Complete all academic and ground training delineated in
   applicable courseware. If not included in the course syllabus, accomplish the minimum
   requirements listed in AFI 11-202, Vol 1, seperately.
   3.4.2. Written Examination. Aircrew members must complete a written examination before
   the end of mission qualification flying training. Formal school End of Course examinations,
   Group stan/eval or equivalent examinations for SMT satisfy this requirement. The formal
   school will not forward their examinations as part of the courseware for inunit qualifications.

 requirements.
 1. Not required for formal school aircrew instructors. If formal school instructors are
 deployed for contingency or exercise augmentation, these events must be completed prior to
 deployment.
 2. Training Status Item. Aircrew members will fly with an instructor until this event is
 accomplished.
 3. Required within 90 days of arrival at new unit.
 4. Grounding Item. Aircrew members must complete training prior to first flight.

3.5. Flying Training Requirements. Satisfactorily completing the appropriate ETCA formal
course satisfies the requirements of this section. Approved in-unit qualification training must be
accomplished IAW applicable formal school courseware and the guidance below:
   3.5.1. Flying training lessons should be completed sequentially. If mission scheduling or
   student progress dictates otherwise, in-unit training sequences may be changed by the unit
   operations officer.
   3.5.2. There should be minimum time lapse between training missions, and every effort
   should be made to complete mission qualification training requirements within the prescribed
   time period.
   3.5.3. Aircrew member requirements may be completed on training or operational missions
   under the supervision of an instructor in the same aircrew position. Comply with restrictions
   in AFI 11-2EC-130J, Vol. 3.
3.6. Specific Mission Training Requirements. It is the unit‘s intent for the WSO candidate to
be dual qualified in both the FSO and MSO positions; however, this may be altered based on the
needs of the unit. FSO training is intended to be completed prior to beginning MSO training to
maintain a fluid course control and progression of students. However, a new WSO student can
begin the MSO course if it is justified for mission requirements. Also, the unit will determine
the need for any changes to the above based upon individual capabilities, instructor availability,
or aircraft availability. If unit needs dictate, individuals may only be qualified in a single
position. The FTU commandant must approve this request prior to beginning the course. ECS
Operators are normally qualified to operate the HF, MF, NB, WB, and PT positions. However,
based on unit needs and individual capabilities, single seat qualifications are at the discretion of
the FTU and Sq/CC.
   3.6.1. Aircrew members qualified and current in special mission events may maintain that
   qualification, once they are mission qualified in their new aircraft.

                                           Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General Requirements.
   4.1.1. Requirements in this chapter and any applicable RTMs satisfy the minimum flying
   and related ground training to maintain currency and the assigned training status. Individual
   proficiency may require a greater number of events. Failure to accomplish these continuation
   training requirements will not affect BMC or MR status but may entail additional training as
   determined by the Sq/CC.
   4.1.2. Training requirements may be completed on any sortie if the accrediting criteria of
   this instruction are met. Sorties and events that are compatible may be credited on the same
   flight.
   4.1.3. Aircrew members will not log continuation training requirements in events in which
   they are unqualified.
   4.1.4. Training events accomplished on a evaluation or an instructor certification (that event)
   may be credited toward the individual‘s volume requirements.
   4.1.5. Flying training events accomplished during formal training will use the course
   completion date (successful evaluation date) to establish the due dates for all subsequent
   currency and requirements. Use actual dates for ground training. Certification events trained
   to a 3C in the FTU will use the date of the checkride as the initial accomplishment date.
   4.1.6. Aircraft flying training requirements may be accomplished in a aircrew training device
   (ATD) as noted in Table 4.4. and Table 4.5.
4.2. Training Levels (TL). The use of experienced based Flight Training Levels (FTLs) and
Ground Training Levels (GTLs) allows the squadron commander to prioritize training resources.
Aircrew members must meet the minimum criteria established in paragraph 4.2.1. and Table 4.1.
before assignment to the respective training level. When these minima are met, awarding a
training level is at the sole discretion of the squadron commander. Note: The aircrew member‘s
availability to fly should not be a factor in assigning a TL.
   4.2.1. FTLs are based on minimum primary aircraft assigned (PAA) time and total time. For
   basic qualification FTL, PAA time will include any variant of C-130J. (Units with C-130J
   variant aircraft assigned and who fly continuation training events in those aircraft may
   include time in those aircraft as PAA).
       4.2.1.1. FTL ―A‖-Highly experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members.
       4.2.1.2. FTL ―B‖-Experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members.
       4.2.1.3. FTL ―C‖-Inexperienced BAQ and MR aircrew members.

 Operator
 (ECS)
 * Note: Pilots upgrading to MP will be placed in FLT C for three semiannual periods and
 minimum FTL requirements to upgrade to higher FTLs.
   4.2.2. Aircrew members may be assigned different FTLs for basic and mission qualifications
   and events. For example, an aircraft commander coming from AC-130s might be assigned
   basic FTL ―A‖, mission FTL ―C‖ with a caveat of FTL ―A‖ for AAR.
   4.2.3. Change of FTL. Once a semiannual period begins, personnel will not be moved to a
   level requiring fewer events until the next semiannual period. However, aircrew members
   may be moved to a level requiring more events.
       4.2.3.1. Additional Training. FTLs do not prevent the squadron commander from
       scheduling an aircrew member for additional training.
   4.2.4. GTLs are based upon operational flying experience.
       4.2.4.1. GTL ―1‖ – Aircrew members with 5 years or greater of operational flying.
       4.2.4.2. GTL ―2‖ – Aircrew members with less than 5 years of operational flying.
4.3. Proration of Training Requirements. See AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, AFSOC Sup. Prorate
aircrew member flying training requirements for individuals following completion of basic
qualification, mission qualification, requalification, and upgrades to a new special mission
qualification, or who are not available for flying duties due to PCS, non-flying TDY, DNIF,
emergency leave, or other unavoidable circumstances which prevent the individual from flying.
Only prorate to zero requirements (No Requirements) for the period of 166 days to 6 months in
cases of qualification, requalification, or upgrade. Aircrew members who enter training after the
start of the training period may be prorated. Prorate individual requirements based on the
number of full calendar months left in the training period. Use Table 4.2. to determine the
number of sorties and events required for an individual after proration.

4.4. Recurrency and Requalification Training. Training is required whenever an aircrew
member does not meet a currency requirement in this instruction. An aircrew member will not
perform events unsupervised until training has been accomplished. Aircrew members requiring
requalification will accomplish training IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, applicable AFSOC or NGB
supplements, and Chapters 2, 3, and 5.
   4.4.1. Recurrency training is the training an aircrew member must accomplish, under the
   supervision of an instructor, when currency has been lost. The event resulting in recurrency
   and each event thereafter are creditable for the current training period. Requalification
   training is the training conducted, under the supervision of an instructor, when an aircrew
   member is unqualified.
   4.4.2. Basic Currency/Requalification. Failure to accomplish a basic currency item that is
   required periodically (Table 4.4., Note 1) or failure to complete the semiannual requirements
   of Table 4.4. results in the loss of basic currency. Basic recurrency/requalification training
   requirements are shown below. Individual proficiency will dictate the number of events to
   be flown with an instructor or flight examiner to satisfy sortie delinquency (as a minimum,
   one sortie will be flown).
   4.4.3. Loss of Currency. Failure to accomplish events listed in continuation training (Tables
   4.4. through 4.5.) or as outlined in RTM results in a loss of currency for that event. Aircrew
   members are non-current the day after event currency expires.
       4.4.3.1. Loss of currency in any Table 4.4. event results in loss of basic aircraft currency.
       These individuals will fly under the supervision of an instructor or flight examiner on all
       sorties until recurrent.
          4.4.3.1.1. Aircrew members who maintain qualification in their primary aircraft and
          a ‗slick‘ C-130J variant may satisfy Table 4.4. currency requirements in either their
          primary aircraft or the C-130J. If basic semiannual currency is lost (failure to
28                                               AFI11-2EC-130JV1 15 SEPTEMBER 2011


         complete the requirements of Table 4.4.), it is lost for both aircraft. Lost basic or
         semiannual currency may be regained in either aircraft or the simulator. ECS
         Operators and MSOs can regain basic or semiannual currency utilizing an Aircrew
         Training Device (ATD).
         4.4.3.1.2. Non-current less than 6 months: Show proficiency in deficient item(s) to
         an instructor. In addition, pilots will perform a takeoff, approach, and landing.
         4.4.3.1.3. Loss of currency exceeding 6-months. Aircrew members non-current in
         designated BAQ events (Table 4.4. note 1 events) in excess of six months results in
         loss of BAQ. Aircrew members non-current in designated mission events (Table 4.5.,
         Note 1 events) in excess of six months results in loss of mission qualification.
  4.4.4. Regaining Currency.
     4.4.4.1. Only Table 4.4. and Table 4.5., Note 1 events require an evaluation (unqualified)
     if loss of currency exceeds 6 months (see AFI 11-202, Vol. 1 and the AFSOC
     Supplement). Other events require showing proficiency to an instructor in the aircraft,
     simulator, or ATD IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 1 as supplemented, to regain currency. If loss
     of currency exceeds 24 months in other than Note 1 events, additional training will
     consist of ground and flight training as directed by the unit commander (training folder
     must be opened).
     4.4.4.2. Aircrew non-current in special mission events which only require an instructor
     certification (Table 5.4.) may regain currency by showing proficiency in that event to an
     instructor.
     4.4.4.3. Aircrew non-current more than 24 months in special mission events (Table 4.5.)
     requiring an evaluation will complete all initial training and evaluation requirements for
     that special mission.
  4.4.5. Requalification Training. Reference AFI 11-202, Vol. 1 as supplemented, to compute
  the expiration date of qualification and determine the required training to become requalified.
  Previous instructors in the EC-130J may re-qualify directly to instructor in the EC-130J
  unless AFI 11-202, Vol 1 as supplemented directs accomplishment of initial qualification
  training (TX-1).
  4.4.6. Core Mission Currency/Requalification. Failure to accomplish all Table 4.5., Note 1
  events during a semiannual period results in the loss of mission currency. Failure to
  accomplish all Table 4.5., Note 2 events during a semiannual period results in the loss of
  currency for that mission event only.         Mission recurrency/requalification training
  requirements are shown below. Loss of mission currency or qualification does not affect
  basic aircraft currency or qualification.
     4.4.6.1. Non-current less than 6 months: Show proficiency in deficient item(s) to an
     instructor.
     4.4.6.2. Loss of currency exceeding 6 months. See AFI 11-202, Vol 1 as supplemented
     to determine required requalification training.
  4.4.7. Special Mission Event Recurrency/Requalification. Special mission event recurrency/
  requalification training requirements are shown below. For a special mission event, loss of
AFI11-2EC-130JV1 15 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              29


   currency/qualification in that special mission event does not affect basic aircraft currency/
   qualification or mission currency/qualification.
       4.4.7.1. Non-current less than six months: Show proficiency in deficient item(s) to an
       instructor.
       4.4.7.2. Non-current greater than six months (unqualified in that special mission): Show
       proficiency in the deficient item(s) to an instructor, qualified in the appropriate special
       mission event. Previously qualified instructors may re-qualify directly to instructor status
       in special mission events, if unqualified for a period less than 60 months.
4.5. Ground Training. Table 4.3. designates ground training requirements for all aircrew
members. Crew members will comply with the time periods listed for their FTL/GTL. Conduct
training IAW the referenced publications, notes in Table 4.3., and the guidance below. The
governing directive or RTM takes precedence over Chapter 4 requirements. If the AFI 11-2EC-
130J, Vol. 1 is also listed as a governing directive, the most restrictive guidance should be
followed.
   4.5.1. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events.      Make-up training should be
   accomplished at the earliest opportunity. The following apply when aircrew members
   exceed due dates for Table 4.3. events.
       4.5.1.1. Grounding items. Aircrew members will not perform flight duties until the
       grounding item is satisfied.
       4.5.1.2. Training status items.     Aircrew members will not fly without instructor
       supervision.
       4.5.1.3. Mission Ready (MR) items. Failure to accomplish the events in Table 4.3.
       results in non-mission ready status and the individual will not deploy as a aircrew
       member. However, the OG/CC may waive training requirements IAW 1.6.4. Squadrons
       will document any aircrew members that are deployed while non-current.
   4.5.2. Block Training. Each group operations training office should establish and administer
   a centralized aircrew block training session. Block training should include all recurring
   ground training required to maintain readiness.
   4.5.3. Ancillary training. This volume is not a comprehensive list of all ancillary training
   required by the DoD. Ancillary training parent instructions take precedence over this AFI for
   those training items. The ETCA website at https://etca.randolph.af.mil lists ancillary
   training courses; each course lists the applicable target group.

 2. This event may be credited in an ATD, for volume and currency.
 Note: The 193 SOW does not possess an EC-130J Aircrew Training Device. Each Pilot and
 Loadmaster completes a simulator refresher course once every 17 months in a C-130J
 simulator. This is the only ATD opportunity to complete events.
 3. Pilots, assigned FTL A & B, must accomplish a takeoff, approach, and landing every 60
 days. Pilots, assigned FTL C, must accomplish a takeoff, approach, and landing every 45
 days. All other aircrew members must accomplish at least one of this event, in their primary
 aircrew position, every 60 days. Failure to accomplish this, within the specified time, results in
 loss of basic aircraft currency.
 4. Flight surgeons only: must fly at least 50% of their annual requirements in the primary unit
 aircraft for the unit to which they are assigned/attached. May credit no more than one sortie
 per calendar day. Must credit a minimum of one night sortie (a sortie on which either takeoff
 or landing and at least 50% of flight duration or one hour, whichever is less, occur between the
 period of official sunset to official sunrise) per semiannual period. 193 SOS/DOA will notify
 appropriate authority when time between flights exceeds 60 days.
 5. Holding patterns consist of entry into a holding pattern and at least one complete circuit.

     an aircrew proficiency sortie. Credit multiple sorties on multi-leg missions with full-stop
     landings.
     4.7.2.2. WSO/FSO must accomplish at least one of the following events: NVG, SCA,
     AAR, MSN and Defensive Systems Operations to log a Basic Sortie.
     4.7.2.3. Other aircrew members may credit a sortie when they perform appropriate
     preflight, in-flight, and post-flight duties in their primary crew position. If more than one
     qualified crew-member, for the same crew position, is on a flight, each may obtain sortie
     credit on the same flight provided each performs appropriate crew position duties. Other
     aircrew members may credit same day sorties not requiring preflight/post-flight (credit
     multiple sorties on multi-leg missions with full-stop landings).
     4.7.2.4. Multiple aircraft qualified aircrew members may credit basic proficiency and/or
     mission sorties on any aircraft in which qualification is maintained. Events which can be
     credited are based on qualification held in each MDS.
  4.7.3. Local Proficiency Sortie (LPS) [ST15]. Pilots only - A training mission including at
  least one hour of primary or instructor time practicing instrument, transition, and emergency
  procedures. Fly maneuvers under the supervision of an IP and repeat them until an
  acceptable level of proficiency is attained or the LPS may not be credited. If the LPS is
  incomplete, the instructor will recommend whether the entire LPS or just the incomplete
  events must be re-accomplished. Instructors and flight examiners need not complete all LPS
  events on a single sortie. Credit a LPS when all events are complete. FTL B and C MC
  pilots will accomplish both LPS in the right seat. IPs and EPs are not required to fly with
  another IP to credit this event. Unit commanders may add to the following minimum LPS
  sortie criteria:
     4.7.3.1. A review of boldface emergency procedures.

      competence during aircraft emergencies. The AC or designated representative will facilitate
      the discussion. This designated representative should be an instructor in their respective
      crew position. Conduct this training with the entire crew present (or thorough cross section
      of aircrew members) in a classroom or in flight. All aircrew members will participate by
      providing inputs/feedback. ACs should fully discuss onset indications, boldface items if
      applicable, and in-flight/landing or ditching/ground egress procedures. Upon completion of
      this discussion, aircrew members should understand the nature of the emergency and how the
      emergency procedure applies to their crew position. Only one emergency procedure is
      required to log this event.
      4.7.5. Pilot                             Proficiency                  Events

Notes: Only note 1 events require an evaluation if loss of currency exceeds 6 months (see AFI 11-
202,Vol. 1, para 1.7.). ATD specific Simulator Event Certification Letter may authorize crediting
semiannual requirements and event currency in excess of Table 4.4. Dual credit events: AR05 duel
credits AR00 and EW01/2/3/4 dual credits EW00. M-monthly, Q-quarterly, d-due in number of
days.
1. Non-currency in any event in this sub area results in loss of mission currency.
2. Non-currency in any event in this sub area results in loss of currency for this sub area only.
3. Non-currency in any event in this sub area results in loss of currency in only that event.
4. Time between events will not exceed 60 days.
5. Time between events will not exceed 90 days (applies only to FSO/WSO for SCA currency).
6. Multiple qualified EC-130J personnel may accomplish this event in either MDS to update
currency in both.
7. Time between events will not exceed 90 days for FTL A; 60 days for FTLs B/C.
8. Failure to complete the required events, within the semiannual period, results in loss of mission
currency, unless waived by operations group commander (see paragraph 1.2.6.3.).
9. May be accomplished in an Aircrew Training Device (ATD) (simulator, PTT or aircraft static)
for volume and currency. May log 100% in an ATD. For ARMS tracking, ATD events will have an
―S‖ prefix. Pilots can accomplish NVG currencies in the ATD without an FSO. Can maintain and
regain currency in an ATD. Note: The 193 SOW does not possess an EC-130J Aircrew Training
Device. Each Pilot and Loadmaster completes a simulator refresher course once every 17 months in
a C-130J simulator. This is the only ATD opportunity to complete events.
10. Only one event can be logged per aircrew member per sortie.
11. Time between events will not exceed 90 days. Failure to accomplish the event within the 90-
day time period results in loss of that event currency.
12. For WSO, FSO, MSO, and ECS time between events will not exceed 60 days. Failure to
accomplish the event within the 60-day time period results in loss of that event currency. For WSO
(MSO only), MSO and ECS this may be accomplished in an Aircrew Training Device (PTT or
aircraft static).
13. This event may only be logged in the FSO position.
14. For a qualified WSO, 50% of the annual requirement shall be accomplished in each position.
15. Event Operation – Antenna may be accomplished by loading antenna without transmitting, and
coordinating with the MSO for antenna switching..
16. An ANTENNA Event will also complete a Dummy Load Event, but a Dummy Load Event will
not complete an ANTENNA Event.

17. Time between events (day or night events) will not exceed 180 days. Failure to accomplish this
event, within the 180-day time period, results in loss of that event currency only. The aircrew
member remains fully qualified for all other qualifications.
18. MPs will perform actual NVG takeoffs and landings; MCs will perform copilot duties.
19. Pilots, who are non-current for air-to-air refueling (AAR) contact, are precluded from
conducting air refueling contacts only. Other air refueling duties, including pre-contact are allowed.
20. To regain AAR currency, LM‘s must complete all AAR checklists (to include a preflight of the
AAR system).
21. One event due annually.
22. Airdrop Event; SATB or actual for pilots and/or FSO/WSO.

   4.8. Mission Event Definitions and Accrediting Criteria. The following event definitions
   apply to Table 4.5. (mission events). Failure to accomplish them results in loss of event
   currency. See AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, for complete flight surgeon flying training requirements.
       4.8.1. Self Contained Approaches (SCA) [AP80]. Perform SCA IAW applicable volumes of
       AFI 11-2EC-130J and AFTTP 3-3. Commando Solo. SCAs may be credited if the pilot
       determines a landing could be made from the approach after reaching the minimum descent
       altitude (MDA) and prior to the missed approach point (MAP). Only the pilot flying the
       approach and WSO/FSO may credit this event. Pilots may credit SCAs toward Table 4.3.
       non-precision approach requirements.
       4.8.2. Authentication [CS05]. Challenge and reply with another person/aircraft/station.
       Only one event may be credited per mission. An actual flight is not required.
       4.8.3. HAVE QUICK [CS15]. This event requires the aircrew member to load HAVE
       QUICK into a UHF radio and accomplish two-way radio checks. If unable to contact outside
       agencies, a radio check between two aircraft radios will be sufficient to credit this event.
       Only credit one event per sortie per crew member. Event can be accomplished in an ATD or
       static aircraft.
       4.8.4. Secure Communications [E06R]: This event requires the aircrew member to load
       secure codes into at least one VHF/UHF/HF/SATCOM radio and accomplish two-way
       secure radio checks. If unable to contact outside agencies, a radio check between two aircraft
       radios will be sufficient to credit this event. Only credit one event per sortie per aircrew
       member. Event can be accomplished in an ATD or static aircraft.
       4.8.5. Surface Radar [EW02]. Engagement with a surface SAM/AAA radar site or radar
       actual, simulator or simulated. Multiple events per sortie may be credited if engagements are
       clearly distinct with respect to time and tactical situation. Engagement must include
       approved tactics IAW AFTTP 3-1. Commando Solo. Credit maximum of two per sortie.
50                                               AFI11-2EC-130JV1 15 SEPTEMBER 2011


  4.8.6. Airborne Intercept (AI) [EW03]. An event will include an actual or simulated
  engagement with a pre-briefed fighter aircraft threat. Engagement must include approved
  tactics IAW AFTTP 3-1. Commando Solo. For an actual fighter engagement pre-brief
  requirements are per AFI 11-214. Multiple events per sortie may be credited. Non-currency
  in this event results in Not Mission Ready status and loss of currency in this event only.
  4.8.7. Expendable [EW04]. Accomplish these events in conjunction with aircraft defense
  maneuvers to the maximum extent possible. In a deployed environment, this event can be
  credited when accomplishing an expendable systems check. Actual chaff or flares should be
  programmed and dispensed to credit an event; however, proper defensive system
  configuration and dry firing the ALE-47 system will suffice during times of limited range
  and/or expendable access. Engagement must include approved tactics IAW AFTTP 3-1.
  Commando Solo. No more than two separate events may be credited by each WSO/FSO per
  mission.
  4.8.8. Defensive Maneuvers [EW09]. Perform defensive maneuvers against simulated
  threats based on a realistic threat scenario. Maneuver should be flown to a logical
  conclusion. Engagement must include approved tactics IAW AFTTP 3-1. Commando Solo.
  4.8.9. Random Tactical Approach [RT01]. Credit this event upon completion of a random
  tactical approach simulating arrival in a threat environment. Accomplish these approaches
  IAW AFTTP 3-3. Commando Solo.
  4.8.10. The CMS [ST50]: This event will consist of a realistic crew-planned combat
  scenario including criteria set forth in this paragraph and coordination between all applicable
  crew positions. Planning should include or discuss the requirements of combat mission
  planning that are not normally ―exercised‖ in local training sorties, such as ATO/ACOs,
  ROE, threat capabilities/counter tactics, Lines of Communication (LOC), any other deployed
  situation scenarios. Intelligence pre-briefing and debriefing will be incorporated in the
  mission planning phase. Crews will load and demonstrate proficiency in operating either
  Secure Comm., HAVE QUICK or a combination of both prior to flight. Sorties may consist
  of any of the core mission/special mission sets or combination thereof. When available,
  cargo should be uploaded and/or downloaded during air-land operations. Mission broadcast
  TOT criteria are on time, on station. Include a realistic threat scenario and at least one
  aircraft defensive maneuver at some point during the mission. Any mission in an actual
  threat environment may suffice for these criteria. The combat entry and exit checklists will
  be initiated to simulate the threat environment. Plan tactical departure and arrivals to begin
  and end the mission flight profile. A thorough chart study must accompany all operations
  within close contact to the ground (i.e. below 3,000 ft altitude AGL). Logging this event will
  dual log the TMS. ECS may credit this event when performing spotter duties or their
  mission systems functions, and the MSO may only credit this event during a Mission
  Systems Operation. Credit Loadmasters with a basic aircrew sortie (ST00), when this event
  is accomplished.
  4.8.11. Tactical Mission Sortie [ST51]. The intent of this event is to provide basic tactical
  training for all crew members. ECS may credit this event when performing spotter duties or
  their mission systems functions. Each Tactical Mission Sortie should include an internal or
  external threat scenario; combat checklists should be accomplished. Aircrew will mission

   4.9.1. Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) [AR00/05]. Accomplish IAW AFI 11-2EC-130J, Vol. 3,
   AFTTP 3-3. Commando Solo, ATP-56(B), and the appropriate technical orders. Aircrew
   members will accomplish rendezvous, contact, and post air refueling procedures to receive
   credit. Non-current pilots must maintain 10 minutes of contact time with no more than two
   inadvertent disconnects after initial contact. AAR certified pilots may credit refueling events
   from either pilot seat. Pilots may log numerous contacts on one sortie if, after each contact,
   the receiver separates ½ NM from the tanker. Only the WSO/FSO accomplishing the
   rendezvous and post air refueling procedures will receive credit (additional rendezvous must
   be accomplished to credit more than one event).
   4.9.2. Ground Refueling.
       4.9.2.1. FARP [AR30]. Accomplish IAW AFI 11-235, AFI 11-2EC-130J, Vol. 3, and
       AFTTP 3-3. Commando Solo (EC-130J designated crews only). To credit this event the
       Pilot operating the fuel panel, Loadmaster, and Hot Refueling Supervisor (HRS) must
       establish the FARP site, pressurize the hose, collapse the site, load equipment and prepare
       aircraft for departure. The FARP must be conducted while using NVGs. When mission
       requirements dictate, this event may be credited for currency without an actual flight with
       Group CC approval.
       4.9.2.2. Hot Refueling [AR31]. Non-FARP qualified aircrew members designated for
       hot refueling certification will accomplish the applicable training IAW AFI 11-235, AFI
       11-2EC-130J Vol 3, AFTTP 3-3. Commando Solo. Hot refueling is the actual transfer of
       fuel, refuel/defuel at fixed-sites, refuel/defuel with approved fuel trucks, and receive fuel
       from a fixed-wing tanker at a FARP with one or more engines operating
AFI11-2EC-130JV1 15 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              53


   4.9.3. Airdrop.
       4.9.3.1. Pilots may credit selected mission events while performing Pilot Monitoring
       (PM) duties (refer to Table 4.5.).
4.9.3.2. Airdrop Proficiency and Currency Requirements. Pilots may take credit
concurrently for an airdrop and other events as defined by event descriptions in Chapter 4.
Loadmasters may take credit when actual load/personnel are loaded and the run-in checklist is
complete.
       4.9.3.3. Airdrop (AD) Events. Log an airdrop event when a successful airdrop is
       accomplished. Pilots may log actual loads, training bundles, or drogue chute only
       training drops (DOTD). If a no-drop condition occurs after the run-in checklist is
       completed, aircraft commanders will determine if enough training was accomplished to
       credit the airdrop for any crew position. See event descriptions for further guidance.
       Both pilots may credit the airdrop event.
           4.9.3.3.1. High Altitude Airdrop [AD03]. While high altitude airdrop is defined as
           above 3,000 feet AGL, aircrew members should attempt to practice airdrops at 10,000
           feet AGL and above. Accomplish event in an aircraft or ATD. Due to drop zone size
           considerations, actual drops may be simulated as long as all checklists are completed.
           If local airspace restrictions preclude flying a high-altitude airdrop, units may credit
           this event in the simulator. Also credit this event for a simulated drop if all mission
           planning was accomplished and flown and/or an actual airdrop of personnel was
           accomplished. Both pilots credit the same airdrop. Simulated airdrops (to include
           those flown in an ATD) may be credited when all the checklists are run and airdrop
           flight profile flown. Loadmasters may credit the event when simulating personnel.
           Loadmasters may not credit this event in the simulator.
           4.9.3.3.2. Personnel Airdrop (Personnel / SATB-P Airdrop) [AD11].
           Loadmasters log this event only when actual personnel are loaded, rigged, all
           checklists through the run-in checklist are accomplished, and there is not a no-drop
           condition due to either loadmaster.
           4.9.3.3.3. CDS Airdrop [AD20]. Pilots, FSO, WSO may credit by dropping an
           airdrop load (e.g. CDS, CRRC, etc.) or SATB-C using CDS procedures. Loadmasters
           log this event when an actual CDS bundle is loaded, rigged, all checklists through the
           run-in checklist are accomplished, and there is not a no-drop condition due to either
           loadmaster.
           4.9.3.3.4. CDS Airdrop JPADS [AD23]. Operator (FSO/WSO/CSO) I-CDS
           (JPADS unguided) airdrop to include mission planning, JPADS computer preflight
           and in-flight actions, flight station and cargo compartment configuration, JPADS
           checklist, sonde drop/monitoring, collateral damage estimate, guided system wireless
           transfer, and I-CDS airdrop to an appropriate DZ. Crews will comply with all
           requirements of AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations. The airdrop
           is considered complete with the successful deployment of the drop sonde(s), update
           of the release point and launch acceptability region (LAR) via the PADS computer
           (with or without sonde data), wireless transfer to the AGU, and airdrop of the bundle.
           There is no minimum altitude for this event, other than the minimum altitude to drop
54                                           AFI11-2EC-130JV1 15 SEPTEMBER 2011


     a sonde, though realistic AFTTP 3-3. Commando Solo altitudes should be used to the
     maximum extent possible based on airspace and DZ restrictions.
        4.9.3.3.4.1. Loadmaster I-CDS/JPADS airdrop to include flight station and
        cargo compartment configuration JPADS checklists, and I-CDS or JPADS airdrop
        to an appropriate DZ. Loadmasters who are only I-CDS certified (Q521, ground
        trained) will load, rig, and drop an actual I-CDS bundle. Loadmasters who are
        JPADS certified (Q522, ground trained) will load and rig an actual JPADS guided
        bundle. JPADS certified loadmasters (Q522) will drop either an actual JPADS
        guided bundle (if desired/permitted), or will simulate a guided bundle drop by
        performing an in-flight wireless update to the AGU and then dropping an actual I-
        CDS bundle instead. For I-CDS drops, in the event that the drop sonde(s) was
        (were) deployed but insufficient drop sonde data was gathered to update the
        release point with the PADS computer, the crew will make all reasonable attempts
        to troubleshoot the problem, to include completion of the I-CDS/JPADS
        troubleshooting guide. If these procedures fail to correct the problem, then at the
        discretion of the aircraft commander, the event can still be considered complete if
        the crew successfully airdrops the bundle by completing the I-CDS/JPADS to
        Conventional Quick Transition Checklist, and performing a racetrack/re-attack
        using conventional ballistic CDS procedures. For I-CDS drops, in the event that
        the drop sonde(s) was (were) deployed but insufficient drop sonde data was
        gathered to update the release point with the PADS computer, the crew will make
        all reasonable attempts to troubleshoot the problem, to include completion of the
        I-CDS/JPADS troubleshooting guide. If these procedures fail to correct the
        problem, then at the discretion of the aircraft commander, the event can still be
        considered complete if the crew successfully airdrops the bundle by completing
        the I-CDS/JPADS to Conventional Quick Transition Checklist, and performing a
        racetrack/re-attack using conventional ballistic CDS procedures.
        4.9.3.3.4.2. Additional Information: PADS Operators must perform all PADS
        duties to credit the event. This event may be accomplished in conjunction with a
        simulated guided drop (e.g., after sonde drop, racetrack and update both the
        guided solution and the unguided/I-CDS solution, perform wireless transfer to the
        AGU, then turn inbound for an actual I-CDS drop). If dropping an actual JPADS
        guided bundle is not practical, loadmasters still require an AGU rigged on a
        bundle aboard the aircraft to simulate all necessary checklist steps, and in-flight
        wireless update. Loadmasters may credit the event if all checklists through the
        slowdown checklist are accomplished, and there is not a no-drop condition due to
        either loadmaster. If a planned or unplanned no-drop condition occurs after the
        Run-In checklist is completed, aircraft commanders will determine if enough
        training was accomplished to credit the event. May dual log with AD20, AD03
        (in any combination) if all requirements of each of the respective events are met.
     4.9.3.3.5. Airdrop Heavy Equipment [AD60]. Loadmasters log this event when an
     actual equipment load is loaded, rigged, all checklists through the run-in checklist are
     accomplished, and there is not a no-drop condition due to either loadmaster. Pilots,
     FSO, WSO may log this event for actual and drogue chute only training drops
     (DOTD) or SATB-H.
AFI11-2EC-130JV1 15 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              55

     requirements. Dual credit LD05.
     4.9.4.4. Maximum Effort Landing Training. Conduct maximum effort takeoff and
     landing initial qualification training on a landing zone (LZ) (or painted landing zone) of
     3,000 feet or longer. Tactical takeoffs should be performed from the main runway when
     it is available (i.e., safe and practical to taxi from an assault landing zone). Takeoffs from
     the assault zone are authorized during formal mission qualification training conducted
     either at the formal school or via the secondary method, IAW applicable regulations,
     technical orders, and procedures.
     4.9.4.5. Unimproved Landing Certification. Conduct this one-time training for flight
     pilots under the direct supervision of an instructor on unimproved airfields. Unimproved
     airfields are airfields where runway acquisition and ground operations are complicated by
     blowing snow, sand, or dirt; undulating terrain, or minimum runway lighting or markings.
     Only affects MR status for missions requiring unimproved field landings. Units will
     record and track this training. Aircraft commanders and above previously certified for
     unimproved landings in the C-130 E/H do not require recertification in the C-130J.
     4.9.4.6. Maximum effort Takeoff [TO20] / Night Maximum effort Takeoff [
     TO22]. Training designed to give pilots experience taking off from a short and austere

      accomplished at night).
      4.9.4.9. Unimproved Airfield Maximum effort Landing. Training designed to support
      the Unimproved Landing Certification. One-time training required for maximum effort
      landing on an unimproved airfield. To qualify, all aircraft commanders qualified for
      maximum effort landings will accomplish their first unimproved airfield landing to the
      satisfaction of an instructor pilot. Night qualification requires an additional night specific
      training. Once qualified, there are no recurring training requirements associated with this
      event. Accomplish training in the aircraft only. An Unimproved Landing certified IP is
      required. The IP will directly supervise the pilot. Check the ASRR to verify the approval
      of any unimproved runway. See AFI 13-217. Dual log with LD30, LD00, LD20 and
      LD05 LD21 (if accomplished at night).
      4.9.4.10. NVG Combat Offload (COL) [NV58]. NVG Combat Offload consist of
      either method A Platforms, or Method B Containers. Log NVG Combat Offload event
      anytime NVG Combat Offload operations are conducted. Real or Training Loads may be
      used for training. Loadmaster NVG Combat Offload ground operations may be
      performed in overt or covert environment. Loadmasters may dual log NV01 when
      accomplishing this task. Note: NV58/59 Loadmasters may dual log NV01 when
      accomplishing these tasks. NV58/59 may be accomplished during ground training
      operations.

                          UPGRADE/SPECIALIZED TRAINING

5.1. General. This chapter identifies the prerequisites and training requirements for qualified
aircrew members upgrading to additional levels of qualification and certification in specialized
flight events.
5.2. Aircraft Commander Upgrade (MPA). Commanders will consider experience,
knowledge, and judgment when identifying candidates. Nominees must have an in-depth
knowledge of systems, procedures, and instructions prior to entry into the upgrade program. The
upgrade program is designed to teach AC duties and responsibilities, as well as left seat mission
qualification. Once upgraded, the MPA will return to FTL C to gain hours and experience.
Reference Table 4.1.
   5.2.1. Aircraft Commander Upgrade Prerequisites. The prerequisite flying time levels for
   upgrade in Table 5.1. are based on pilots having gained the knowledge and judgment
   required to effectively accomplish the unit‘s mission. Flying experience should include left
   seat time prior to entering formal school upgrade training (Aircraft Commander Prepatory
   Course). AC candidates will also meet all prerequisites listed in the ETCA and the formal
   school syllabus. To become eligible for the Aircraft Commander Prepatory Course, each
   MC, in addition to obtaining the minimum hours (recommending a minimum of 500 PMAI)
   and IP recommendations, will maintain a log of flight experiences (MPA prepatory log)
   created by the 193 OSF/OST. This document will aid in assessing a candidate‘s ability to
   accept a higher responsibility as an Aircraft Commander and document exposure to an
   adequate amount of mission experiences. Instructors and current MPA pilots will document
   the MC‘s log during post mission debriefs.

Table 5.1. Minimum Hours Required to Upgrade to Aircraft Commander.
     TOTAL

   1,000-1,299             800
 Notes: All pilots with prior rotary wing time will be trained as MCs unless
 they have a minimum of 500 hours of fixed wing time (including UPT flying
 time). For the purpose of this table, PMAI hours is any type C-130 aircraft.
 Subtract ‗Other‘ flight time in excess of 100 hours from Total hours. Subtract
 all ‗Other‘ time from the required PMAI time. Add up to 200 C-130 simulator
 hours toward Total and PMAI requirements.
   5.2.2. Aircraft Commander Upgrade, Ground and Flight Training Requirements. The
   primary method of AC upgrade is satisfactory completion of the MAJCOM approved formal
   school course. Fill all available quotas before requesting a secondary method waiver IAW
   Chapter 1.

       5.2.2.1. EC-130J. MCs must have completed the Aircraft Commander Preparatory
       Course prior to formal aircraft commander upgrade training. This in-unit training
       consists of academic and flight training and is tracked with the aid of the MPA prepatory
       log.
5.3. Instructor Program. A sound and practical aircrew instructor program is a prerequisite for
effective training, standardization, and aircraft mishap prevention.
   5.3.1. 193 SOS/CC with the aid of Aircrew Review Board members, will personally review
   each instructor candidate‘s qualifications. Instructor candidates will be selected based on
   their background, experience, maturity, and ability to instruct. The following characteristics
   must be considered:
       5.3.1.1. Instructional Ability.   An instructor is a teacher and must understand the
       principles of instruction.
       5.3.1.2. Judgment. Instructors must possess judgment necessary to meet unexpected or
       induced emergencies, and the ability to exercise sound judgment through mature
       realization of their own, their student‘s, and the aircraft‘s limitations.
       5.3.1.3. Personal Qualities. The instructor must have patience, tact, understanding, and
       the desire to instruct others. Instructors must have a personality which inspires and wins
       respect of each student.
       5.3.1.4. Technical Knowledge. The instructor must be thoroughly familiar with
       respective aircraft systems and equipment, normal and emergency operating procedures.
       Additionally, all instructors must be thoroughly familiar with aviation management,
       flying training, and flying operations publications.
       5.3.1.5. Flying Experience. Instructors must possess reasonable flying experience to
       include desired standards of skill and proficiency in both the aircraft and assigned
       missions. Flying hours alone cannot be accepted as criteria for selection to instructor.

       5.3.1.7. Instructor Pilots. Instructor pilots are responsible at all times for the conduct of
       the flight and safety of the aircraft. If at any time during the flight, the judgment or
       proficiency of the student at the controls raises a question in the instructor‘s mind as to
       the student‘s ability to safely complete a prescribed maneuver, the instructor will
       immediately take over the controls of the aircraft. The instructor should then explain and
       demonstrate proper methods of conducting the maneuver prior to the student resuming
       control of the aircraft. All instructors will place special emphasis on the procedures for
       positive identification of emergency conditions before initiating corrective action. In
       addition, instructors will place a high emphasis on the procedures for positive exchange
       of control; these procedures will be thoroughly briefed.
       5.3.1.8. Instructor Aircrew Members (Other Than Pilots). Each instructor aircrew
       member is responsible for the safe execution of the duties of their respective crew
       position. At any time during the flight, if the judgment or proficiency of the student

      the duties of the aircrew position, the instructor will immediately assume those duties.
      The instructor should then explain and demonstrate the proper method of executing those
      duties.
      5.3.1.9. Instructor Deficiencies. Instructors who demonstrate deficiencies in their ability
      to instruct may be used in their primary crew position (provided the deficiency does not
      involve primary crew duties). Commanders will take the necessary action to either
      retrain or remove those individuals from instructor status IAW Air Force, AFSOC, and
      ANG directives.
      5.3.1.10. Instructor Responsibilities. Instructors will be thoroughly familiar with all
      courseware and contents of the applicable attachments to this instruction for qualification,

Form 1381/4348, USAF Certification of Aircrew Training.
5.5. Special Mission Qualifications and Certifications. The commander will select aircrew
members qualified in the unit‘s mission to maintain additional special qualifications and
certifications. A flight evaluation is required for Special Mission Qualifications, while
Certifications are gained IAW paragraph 5.6. Special mission events are not considered core
mission events and are not required for mission ready status. Instructors are authorized to teach
any special qualifications in which they are qualified and current unless specifically restricted.
   5.5.1. MP NVG Takeoff and Landing certification. Units may certify mission qualified MP
   to perform non-max effort NVG takeoffs and landings. Make a ―MP NVG Takeoff and

   JPADS certification will be completed in accordance with the JPADS training syllabus and
   guide. JPADS PADS operator (PO) mobile training team (MTT) instructors must be an IP,
   FSO/WSO/CSO, but are not required to be qualified in the MDS (e.g., a certified C-130J IP
   may perform PADS operator primary or instructional duties on a C-130E/H). For non-MDS
   qualified crew members, log other time with crew duty position as XP. Aircrew members
   that previously completed the interim JPADS training syllabus are considered JPADS
   certified. All aircrew members will complete Phase I training. Phase I Pilots will receive a
AFI11-2EC-130JV1 15 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              61


   JPADS certification, but will not require any continuation training. In addition, aircrew
   members performing PADS Operator (PO) or loadmaster (LM) duties will complete Phase II
   qualification training, and require continuation training. PO qualification includes I-CDS
   and JPADS drop operations. If a unit/Mobile Training Team does not have access to
   syllabus-required training equipment, instructors will, with unit CC/DO concurrence,
   determine if a PO student has received sufficient instruction for certification. All simulated
   events must be verbally debriefed. For example, if a unit has drop sondes but no AGU,
   consider the PO syllabus Wireless Transfer Event complete if the student imports Drop sonde
   data and simulates Wireless AGU Data Transfer. LM certification is split into I-CDS (Phase
   I) and JPADS operations (Phase II). LM's that do not complete hands-on AGU training will
   be certified as Phase I only until JPADS Phase II training is complete.
       5.5.2.1. Upon completion of applicable training, aircrew members are considered
       JPADS/I-CDS qualified/certified or I-CDS-only certified as described in 5.5.2.1.
       5.5.2.2. Units may document Phase I training on AF IMT 1522, ARMS Additional
       Training Accomplishment Report for non-PO pilots. Use ARMS event identifiers Q502
       "JPADS/I-CDS certification" for non-PO certified pilots, Q521 "JPADS Phase I" for I-
       CDS/non-guided certified loadmasters, and Q522 "JPADS Phase 2" for PADS Operator
       certified aircrew members and JPADS certified loadmasters.
       5.5.2.3. The PADS Operator (PO) is defined as any JPADS Phase II certified rated
       officer. Normally this consists of a FSO/WSO/CSO, but may also be a PADS Operator
       from another airframe (e.g., C-130E/H, C-17) or pilot. For the purposes of non-current
       PADS Operators who need an instructor, like specialty is not required (e.g., a navigator
       PADS Operator may instruct a pilot PADS Operator on events AD23).
   5.5.3. Maximum Effort Takeoff and Landings. Units may certify selected MPs to perform
   Maximum Effort/Maximum effort type Takeoff and Landings. Make a ―Maximum Effort
   Takeoff and Landing‖ entry in the AF Form 1381/4348 upon certification and maintain

platforms.
Aircrew Review Board (ARB)—The ARB is designed to provide an overview of the 193 OG
training program, provide a forum for informal discussions about current issues, as well as to
approve upgrade nominations for all crew positions. 193 OSF/A3T is responsible to organize,
 74                                               AFI11-2EC-130JV1 15 SEPTEMBER 2011


and prepare minutes to document upgrade nominations that were approved. Normally, the ARB
is attended by 193 OG/CC, 193 SOS/CC, 193 SOS/DO, 193 OSF/A3T, 193 OG/OGV, and the
appropriate section chief for the needs of the ARB.
Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI)—Aircraft assigned to a unit to assist in maintaining
readiness. Aircraft designated as BAI assets do not receive funding or manning consideration for
the unit.
Basic Aircraft Qualification Aircrew Member—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed qualification training in the basic aircrew position and maintains aircraft currency
IAW this instruction.
Basic Mission Capable Aircrew Member—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed mission qualification and is maintaining 50 percent of the applicable mission
qualification currency requirements of this instruction. Basic mission capable aircrew members
may perform primary crew duties on any unilateral training mission. For other missions, the unit
commander must determine the readiness of each basic mission capable aircrew member to
perform primary crew duties.
Calendar Month—Requirements are due once per month and not necessarily associated with a
30/60 day requirement. For example, an aircrew member could accomplish the event on
1 February and then on 31 March the following month and still fulfill the requirement.
Conversion Training—Training is normally associated with a unit conversion to another MDS.
Conversion training requires completion of a formal school initial qualification course. For unit
conversions, when formal school courses are not available to handle the throughput, MAJCOMs
will develop, and coordinate with the training command, in-unit training plans that maximize use
of highly experienced personnel as the initial cadre.
Core Mission Events—An aircrew member must be qualified in all core mission events to be
considered Mission Ready (MR) or Mission Capable (MC). To determine how non-currency in
any core mission event affects overall mission currency, refer to the aircraft‘s Mission Ready
Flying Requirements Table (Table 4.4.). Loss of qualification in any core mission event results
in loss of overall mission qualification. A core mission event will be considered an instructor
certified event when it is not required to be evaluated on the Initial Mission Evaluation.
Squadrons will maintain at least 100 percent of their required manning as MR. AFSOC unit
Squadron Commander and/or Director of Operations CC/DO will determine the
status/qualification of aircrew members in excess of 100 percent manning requirement.
Difference Training—Training accomplished when changing between same design aircraft and
the amount of training needed for qualification does not warrant attendance at a formal
qualification course.
Dual Qualified—An aircrew member who is qualified in more than one crew position in the
same MDS.
Event—A training item to be accomplished. Multiple events may be completed and logged
during a sortie unless specifically excluded elsewhere in this instruction.

systems on the aircraft.
Semiannual Requirements—Events required to be completed within a six month period; those
periods being October – March and April – September.
Special Mission Events—Some MR/MC aircrew members will carry additional qualifications in
special mission events. Unit CC/DO will determine which aircrew members will be qualified in
special mission events. Unit CC/DO will determine if special mission events have affected C-
rating and report variations through Status Of Resources and Training Systems (SORTS).
Special mission requirements are also shown in Table 4.5.
Total Flying Time—Total time for all aircraft flown in military service to include student time.
Time accumulated must be in the aircrew member's current rating (i.e., pilot, navigator, etc.).
Training Status—A deficient status in which an aircrew member must fly under the supervision
of an instructor when occupying a primary crew position. Once deficient items are corrected, the
aircrew member is removed from training status.

member must accomplish in a given period of time (i.e., quarterly or semiannually).
Weapons Systems Officer—A qualified electronic warfare officer whose duties encompass both
the FSO and MSO positions.
AFI11-2EC-130JV1 15 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                             77


                                         Attachment 2
        CHEMICAL DEFENSE TASK QUALIFICATION TRAINING (CDTQT)

A2.1. General. This attachment contains the initial and recurring aircraft CDTQT requirements
for AFSOC aircrews. The purpose of CDTQT is to reinforce the aircrew member's awareness of
limitations and demonstrate physiological effects while wearing the aircrew chemical defense
ensemble (ACDE). The complications of heat exhaustion, fatigue, hyperventilation, limited
dexterity, and hampered communication can all be experienced during CDTQT. All aircrew
members must complete initial aircrew flight equipment chemical defense training prior to
accomplishing initial CDTQT. Complete initial disaster preparedness training for the ground
ensemble prior to CDTQT if the ground ensemble is used. Initial CDTQT should be done in the
aircraft and also done in the aircraft at least every four years. If initial CDTQT is done in the
simulator, the next event must be logged in the aircraft. All other times the event may be
accomplished in the simulator. Accomplishing the event in the aircraft dual logs normal
CDTQT.
A2.2. CDTQT Procedures:
   A2.2.1. Accomplish CDTQT in-flight using the primary unit aircraft. Aircrew members will
   perform primary crew duties while wearing the ACDE. All in-flight profiles must be a
   minimum of 1 hour and accomplished on training missions only. Accomplish CDTQT in the
   simulator using primary unit aircraft WSTs. All simulator profiles must be a minimum of 2
   hours and flown on full tactical simulation profiles. This should include a threat scenario and
   aircraft emergencies. Flying the simulator profile with the entire crew wearing ACDE is
   highly encouraged.
   A2.2.2. The entire ACDE need not be used. Normally, wear the blower assembly unit, inter-
   communication box, cotton gloves, butyl rubber gloves, nomex gloves, and AERPS mask
   hood and helmet (if applicable). Either the ACDE or ground ensemble may be worn during
   aircraft preflight. Ground ensembles will come from training assets.
   A2.2.3. When wearing the CBO mask, do not accomplish CDTQT when required to wear
   NVGs. When wearing AERPS, NVG events will be accomplished.
   A2.2.4. An observer is required to monitor each aircrew member while accomplishing
   CDTQT in-flight. An instructor or flight examiner in each respective crew position, not
   wearing the chemical defense components, will act as the observer for initial CDTQT.
   Exception: An IP not wearing the ensemble and not performing any other instructor duties
   may act as the observer for initial WSO/FSO training. During recurring CDTQT, if the
   aircrew member can be directly observed by another primary aircrew member, a dedicated
   observer is not required. The dedicated observer during recurring CDTQT may also wear
   AERPS for all crew positions except pilots (two non-pilot aircrew members wearing AERPS
   may observe one another). Additionally, for safety purposes, one aircrew member in the
   back of the aircraft must not be wearing AERPS in case of smoke and fumes.
       A2.2.4.1. An instructor or flight examiner pilot not wearing the chemical defense
       components will occupy the opposite seat during initial pilot CDTQT. During recurring
       CDTQT, a mission qualified pilot not wearing the chemical defense components will act
       as the observer and occupy the opposite seat. With squadron commander approval, both
 78                                           AFI11-2EC-130JV1 15 SEPTEMBER 2011


      pilots may wear AERPS while occupying the pilot seats provided both pilots have
      accomplished CDTQT within the past 90 days. The squadron commander may delegate
      this authority to the operations officer or mission commander.
      A2.2.4.2. Observers will closely monitor aircrew members actions during CDTQT. If an
      aircrew member experiences difficulties such as excessive thermal stress, headaches,
      hyperventilation, nausea, etc., the aircrew member will remove the ensemble. The
      observer will notify the AC of any difficulties encountered.
      A2.2.4.3. Pilots will accomplish a minimum of one approach and landing. Pilots may
      accomplish CDTQT in either seat.
      A2.2.4.4. All other aircrew members will credit CDTQT while performing their normal
      crew duties in-flight
A2.3. Mission profile. Aircrew members will accomplish CDTQT during a normal mission
profile. In addition:
   A2.3.1. Pilots will accomplish a minimum of one approach and landing.       Pilots may
   accomplish CDTQT in either seat.
AFI11-2EC-130JV1 15 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                          79
