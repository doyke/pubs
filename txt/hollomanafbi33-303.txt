    2.8. Site Management.
       2.8.1. All sites shall follow the Holloman site template (Figure A2.1.). The look and feel
       of all sites must remain standard across the base. The look and feel includes standard
HOLLOMANAFBI33-303 19 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                             5


       colors, fonts, and backgrounds. The approved unit emblem will be located in the space
       provided by the templates and not presented in other locations. Customization on the site
       must remain very minimal and requires Knowledge Operations Management Center
       approval to avoid any issues for migration to future software versions (see Attachment 2).
       2.8.2. Graphics will only be used for navigation and shall be minimal in size (i.e.,
       thumbnail or icon size). No other graphics are allowed to be displayed on any site as part
       of the site layout. The use of other graphics must be approved by the Knowledge
       Operations Management Center. The size and placement of official photos (i.e.
       commanders, chiefs, deputies, etc.) must comply with the requirements set in this
       instruction (Attachment 2).
       2.8.3. All sites must have the Content Managerâ€™s contact information located on the site.
       2.8.4. Follow standard site naming conventions for organizational and functional sites.
       2.8.5. Sites not visited for at least 180 days are subject to deletion. Group, Unit and
       Functional Content Managers will be notified via e-mail at least two times prior to
       deletion.
       2.8.6. Sites should be maintained at the highest level possible to prevent duplication of
       content and to maintain a consistent architecture.
       2.8.7. All sites shall be uniform in appearance. Always be consistent on the location of
       web zones by using the standard template. This will significantly reduce user frustration.
       2.8.8. Deviation from the SharePoint format described in this instruction is prohibited
       unless authorized (in writing) by the KOMC Content Management Office.
   2.9. Workflow. As it relates to SharePoint, Workflow is the execution of a defined business
   process incorporating the corresponding responsibilities, actions, tasks, and documents into
   the process. Implementing a business process using a Workflow provides many benefits
   since tasks, documentation, and data are maintained in a central location. The KOMC
   encourages Holloman personnel to use Workflow for review/staffing processes. For
   instructions       on        how        to       use          Workflow,          go       to
   https://holloman.eim.acc.af.mil/49_MSG/49_CS/SCX/NTC/SharePoint_Training/defaul
   t.aspx.
3. Air Force Portal. Organizations should remember the AF Portal provides all airmen,
civilians, contractors and authorized guests worldwide access to core Air Force private
information and is the central knowledge source for many combat support and personnel
services. Responsibilities specifically spelled out in AFI 33-129, Web Management and Internet
Use, must be followed.
   3.1. The KOMC Content Management staff serve as the AF Portal Content Mangers for
   Holloman AFB.
   3.2. Group and Unit Content Managers for the Air Force Portal will attend classroom
   training conducted by the KOMC (Building 839).
   3.3. All Holloman portal sites will publish the appropriate Content Managerâ€™s contact
   information to ensure content is up-to-date and relevant. Organization e-mail groups are
 6                                          HOLLOMANAFBI33-303 19 SEPTEMBER 2013


     preferred to ensure appropriate personnel are available if there are any issues or problems
     with the content on the site.
     3.4. Organizational portal sites will be maintained for wing level organizations at a
     minimum. Core information about an organization will be published providing key
     information about an organization providing who they are, what they do, what services they
     provide, key functional contacts, and appropriate news and events highlighting organizations
     accomplishments.
     3.5. Group and unit content managers will validate at least on a quarterly basis the site
     content, links published, and ensure authorized content managers and content publishers
     appointed in writing are listed within the user management functions on their organization
     portal sites.
4. Office Communications Server (OCS). Microsoft CommunicatorÂ® should be used for all
internal communications between two or more people. Microsoft LiveMeetingÂ® is available
when multiple people need to collaborate in real time (conferences, training, etc.). Microsoft
Group Chat is available for situations where people need a persistent communications channel
for live collaboration and support.
     4.1. OCS will be used for official communication only.
     4.2. Contact the KOMC Content Management Office (572-2751/2752) for assistance with
     Microsoft Office Communicator.
