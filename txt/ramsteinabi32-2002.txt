This instruction aligns with AFPD 32-20, Fire Emergency Services, and implements AFI 32-2001, The
Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program. It establishes policies, practices and procedures
for a comprehensive base fire prevention program within the Kaiserslautern Military Community (KMC).
It applies to all personnel assigned or attached to units in the KMC, to include all tenant organizations. It
assigns responsibilities for fire prevention and protection and establishes a recognized standard practice
for safeguarding life and property from the effects of fire. Failure to prevent fires could seriously hamper
mission accomplishment here and at other bases worldwide. Therefore, it is essential that all personnel,
military and civilian, maintain constant vigilance to prevent needless loss of life and property to fire. This
instruction is consistent with Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) standards, National
Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards, Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC), Fire Protection Engi-
neering for Facilities, Engineering Technical Letters and the International Building Code. Standards for
unique conditions for which no fire prevention criteria have been developed or published will be devel-
oped according to the recommendation of the KMC fire department. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accor-
dance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in AFRIMS (AF Portal). Ensure
that any local policy/guidance, publications, instructions or supplements are created in accordance with
Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, and the United States Air
Force of Europe (USAFE) supplement.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
The updated publication will be used to provide facility managers and unit commanders with current fire
prevention requirements as outlined in the NFPA standards. According to these current NFPA standards in
the 2003 edition, the 1998 version of Ramstein Air Base Instruction (RABI) 32-2002 Fire Prevention
Program is outdated. Redundant and conflicting information was removed. Procedures that are no longer
applicable were updated to current standards. This instruction applies to all the Air Force (AF) KMC

                            ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT

1.1. Scope/Purpose.
   1.1.1. The scope of this instruction defines policies and responsibilities and sets standards and proce-
   dures for fire prevention and protection as a facility engineering function.
   1.1.2. The purpose of this instruction establishes minimum fire prevention measures for complete fire
   protection services to prevent loss of life or personal injuries and reduce property loss to the lowest
   attainable level consistent with mission, sound engineering and economic principles.

1.2. Authority.
   1.2.1. This office is governed by AFI 32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention
   Program, 1 April 1999.
   1.2.2. The KMC fire department is authorized to inspect, at reasonable times, any building or pre-
   mises, for dangerous or hazardous conditions or materials as set forth in this standard. The fire depart-
   ment will inform any person failing to comply with this standard of their violation. All violations will
   be recorded in writing and the reference standard noted.
   1.2.3. Fire protection waivers, exceptions and alterations: The fire department is not authorized to
   approve waivers, exceptions or alterations. Waivers, exceptions and alterations concerning fire protec-
   tion will be made in accordance with (IAW) AFI 32-2001 and UFC 3-600-02, Operations and Main-
   tenance: Inspection, Testing, and Maintenance of Fire Protection Systems.

1.3. Objective. The main objective of the fire department is to prevent loss of life, injuries and property
damage caused by fire. In order to prevent or reduce loss of life from fire, commanders, facility managers,
supervisors and all military and civilian personnel must take adequate precautions. Loss of government
property will result in an unnecessary use of funds and costly delays that could seriously hinder our
national defense efforts. Since the most effective means of reducing fire loss is an aggressive and
well-managed fire prevention program, all AF personnel assigned to the KMC, support units and contrac-
tors, will adhere to all provisions of this regulation.

1.4. Fire Prevention and Protection Program.
   1.4.1. Every AF activity will have a fire prevention and protection program based on its size, mission
   and available resources.
   1.4.2. The Base Fire Marshals, (Commander 435 Civil Engineering Group [435 CEG/CC] and Com-
   mander Civil Engineering Squadron [435 CES/CC]) are responsible to the Commander 435 Air Base
   Wing (435 ABW/CC) for fire prevention and protection within the KMC. In addition, the Base Fire
   Marshals are also responsible for the technical development and execution of an effective fire preven-
   tion and protection training program for the KMC.
   1.4.3. Fire Inspection Program: The fire department performs facility inspections and advises unit
   commanders, facility managers and supervisors of hazards and fire safety deficiencies noted in their
   facilities. The primary responsibility for correcting identified hazards or deficiencies rests with the
6                                                         RAMSTEINABI32-2002 30 JANUARY 2008


    unit commander and facility manager of the facility inspected. Facilities are to be inspected by the fire
    department inspectors as determined by the Base Fire Chief.

    throughout the year. Contact the Fire Prevention Section at 480-5940-3338.

1.6. Fire Protection Engineering Program.
    1.6.1. All construction, alterations, modifications, renovations and self-help projects shall be coordi-
    nated with the 435 CEG and the base fire protection plans review technician, located in building 534,
    or call 480-5940/3338. All work must be documented on an AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work
    Request, and submitted through the 735 CES Customer Service Section in building 520.

1.7. Construction Requirements, Alterations, Modifications and Self-Help Projects:
    1.7.1. All AF and associated unit construction within the KMC must comply with the provisions of all
    applicable Engineer Technical Letters, NFPA standards and requirements with UFC 3-600-01, Design
    Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities. This applies to new construction, reconstruction, rehabili-
    tation, alterations, modifications, self-help projects and maintenance or repair of existing facilities.

                                                 Chapter 3

                                  FIRE PREVENTION ASSESSMENT

3.1. Frequently Used Terms.
    3.1.1. Fire Hazard: A condition that could cause a fire.
    3.1.2. Fire Safety Deficiency (FSD): A condition which reduces fire safety below an acceptable level,
    including noncompliance with standards, but which by itself will not cause a fire to occur. It could
    increase the severity of damage or loss should a fire occur, or cause a delay in the detection or report-
    ing of a fire.
    3.1.3. FSD Code: A Roman numeral from one (I) through five (V) which signifies the relative seri-
    ousness of the deficiency and is used to prioritize correction efforts and resources. (See Attachment
    2, FSD Worksheet.)

3.2. Fire Prevention Practices.
    3.2.1. The primary responsibility for fire prevention and compliance with the recommendations of
    fire inspectors rests with the unit commander. Commanders accomplish this through functional man-
    agers, facility managers and supervisors of the unit being inspected. Fire inspectors will visit all facil-
    ities and areas at periodic intervals to ensure prompt detection and elimination of fire hazards. These
    visits do not relieve the commander or the facility manager of the responsibility of identifying hazards
    in areas under their control. Commanders and facility managers will be notified of existing hazards in
    their areas by the use of AF Form 1487. Failure to take immediate action to eliminate a hazardous con-
    dition will result in the submission of reports for corrective actions through command channels (group
    commander level) to the unit commander. As directed by the Base Fire Marshal or Fire Chief, fire
    inspectors will conduct no-notice walk-through inspections. If an AF Form 1487 is issued, the follow-
    ing corrective actions must be taken by the unit commander and facility manager:
       3.2.1.1. If the hazards cannot be corrected at once, implement interim control measures to reduce
       the risk to an acceptable level, as instructed by the fire inspector.
       3.2.1.2. FSDs will be programmed for corrective actions, using the AF Form 332, and submitted
       to the Base Civil Engineer (BCE). For FSDs I and II, the AF Form 332 will be given to the unit
       commander for signature and forwarding to Civil Engineering (CE) for submittal.
       3.2.1.3. For hazards that are not defined as an FSD and cannot be corrected within 30 days, the
       facility managers will establish a hazard abatement plan. This action should be accomplished on
       an AF Form 3, Hazard Abatement Plan, through the wing safety office. Once completed, a copy of
       the form must be forwarded to the Fire Prevention Section.
       3.2.1.4. The form will be sent to the unit’s commander through command channels (group com-
       mander level) whenever the following deficiencies are noted:
           3.2.1.4.1. When correctable hazards are recurring.
           3.2.1.4.2. When an effective fire prevention program has not been established or enforced.

3.3. AF Form 1487 Procedures.
RAMSTEINABI32-2002 30 JANUARY 2008                                                                        9


  3.3.1. The AF Form 1487 will be used to document all fire prevention visits. When significant find-
  ings are identified, the fire inspector will annotate the form with the fire hazards or deficiencies noted
  during the assessment and the corrective actions required to eliminate them, including references to
  the governing standard and interim control measures. This form also provides a tracking mechanism
  to follow up on corrective actions.
  3.3.2. The AF Form 1487 will be delivered to the facility manager or the alternate. The facility man-
  agers or alternates are responsible for initiating corrective actions within their authority and responsi-
  bility, by following the corrective actions annotated on the form.
  3.3.3. On the back of the AF Form 1487, the facility manager will annotate the corrective actions
  taken and the date they were implemented.
  3.3.4. The facility manager will ensure that the unit commander reviews the form and signs the appro-
  priate block on the back of the form.
  3.3.5. The facility managers will keep a copy of the completed form for their records and return the
  original to the Fire Prevention Section. The form shall be returned to the Fire Prevention Section
  before the suspense date listed on the front of the form in block 5.
  3.3.6. If facility managers require additional time to initiate corrective action, they can request exten-
  sions to the suspense date from the Fire Prevention Section by calling 480-5940/3338. Repeated
  overdue AF Forms 1487 will be channeled through the proper command channels for corrective
  actions.
  3.3.7. Facility managers are required to track the completion of work required to correct deficiencies.
  Some corrections will take long periods of time. Facility managers must relay work order numbers
  and the status of extended projects to the Fire Prevention Section as soon as possible.
  3.3.8. For hazards presenting imminent danger, the AF Form 1487 will be prepared on the spot. The
  fire inspector will provide a copy to the supervisor in charge and a copy will be hand delivered to the
  unit commander. If such an occasion occurs, all references need not to be included. NOTE: The oper-
  ation may be terminated and the facility may be closed until an assessment by the Fire Chief and/or
  Base Fire Marshal or their representative is made regarding the safety of the situation.

     4.1.5. No parking is permitted within 15 feet of any fire hydrant or fire department sprinkler connec-
     tion.
     4.1.6. Vehicles will not block the entrance and exit roadways to any fire stations in the KMC or use
     such areas as turnarounds or short cuts to avoid traffic jams.
     4.1.7. Vehicles will not drive over a fire hose without hose bridges in place, unless directed by the
     firefighters. Vehicles will proceed through areas where fire operations are being conducted only at the
     direction of firefighters or security police assigned to traffic control.
     4.1.8. The security forces desk sergeant will dispatch a suitable number of patrols to the scene of a
     fire emergency to provide traffic control and security of government property. These patrols will
     report to the senior fire officer (commander) at the scene.
     4.1.9. If forcible entry is required by the fire department into a residence, security forces will secure
     the residence until a unit representative or a building leader or alternate can be contacted to stand by
     or a locksmith has repaired the damage.
     4.1.10. Security forces may be expected to provide security guards at buildings where a fire of
     unknown or suspicious origin occurred, until such time as the fire investigation board has completed
     its investigation.

                          FIRE REPORTING, EVACUATION AND DRILLS

5.1. Fire Reporting Procedures.
   5.1.1. Initiate evacuation of the area or facility by yelling “Fire, Fire, Fire” repeatedly or by activating
   the fire alarm.
   5.1.2. Call the fire department from a safe location using one of the following emergency numbers
   that pertain to the type of phone system being used:
       5.1.2.1. On base: Defense Switched Network (DSN)—dial 112.
       5.1.2.2. Commercial—dial 06371-47-112.
       5.1.2.3. The commercial or cellular phone number can be used to contact the KMC fire depart-
       ment for emergencies at off-base residences. This will ensure the caller gets an English-speaking
       operator who can then call the dispatch center for their servicing fire department.
       5.1.2.4. Dialing 112 or 110 on commercial or cellular phones off-base puts a caller into the Ger-
       man national emergency reporting system. The caller cannot be sure that they will be able to reach
       an English-speaking operator from these numbers.
   5.1.3. Give the dispatch operator the following information:
       5.1.3.1. Building number or location of fire, including the installation (Ramstein, Vogelweh,
       Landstuhl, Sembach, etc.).
       5.1.3.2. Describe object that is on fire (i.e., car, a transformer, smell or see smoke, etc.).
       5.1.3.3. If anyone is trapped in the facility or personnel unaccounted for, if known.
       5.1.3.4. Your name and a number you can be reached at. Stay at that number as long as it is safe,
       in case the operator needs to call you back.
       5.1.3.5. Stay on the line until the operator tells you that you can go, if you are in danger tell the
       operator that you will call again when you are at a safe location and ensure you call the operator
       back.
       5.1.3.6. The person discovering the fire should meet the arriving fire crews to give details as
       needed.

5.2. Evacuation. Upon activation of the fire alarm system, the facility will be evacuated and occupants
shall proceed to a designated location, per the facility evacuation plan, at least 75 feet away from the facil-
ity. NOTE: Never reenter an evacuated facility.

5.3. Fire Evacuation Drills.
   5.3.1. Facility managers are encouraged to conduct fire drills to test their fire evacuation plans, at reg-
   ular intervals. NOTE: At no time will facility managers or building occupants initiate a fire evacua-
   tion drill using the building fire alarm system without first coordinating with the base Fire Prevention
   Section.

     policy, schools are required one fire drill per week during the first 4 weeks of school and one per
     month thereafter. The fire department will assist schools by conducting one drill each month that class
     is in session, with one additional during the first 30 days of school. All fire evacuation drills will be
     coordinated between the fire department and school principal or vice principal. No-notice drills may
     be performed when deemed necessary by the Base Fire Marshal or the Base Fire Chief.
        5.3.2.1. School principles must develop a fire evacuation plan for each building in use. The fire
        department will assist with fire drills once a month, plus four additional drills during the first 30
        days of school.
        5.3.2.2. School principles are responsible for coordinating fire drill dates with the Fire Prevention
        Section. The Fire Prevention Section can be reached at 480-5940/3338 or fax 480-2526.
        5.3.2.3. Before assisting with a fire drill, the fire department will check with the administration
        office to ensure no unforeseen situation is present making it necessary to postpone the fire drill.
        5.3.2.4. The results of the fire drill will be made a matter of record and retained by the principal
        and the Fire Prevention Section.
     5.3.3. Child Development Centers and School Age Programs: The fire department will conduct fire
     drills on a monthly basis. One additional fire drill will be conducted during the first week of each new
     session.
     5.3.4. Places of Public Assembly, Institutional, Medical: Quarterly.
     5.3.5. Industrial/Storage: Semiannually.
     5.3.6. Administrative and all other Facilities: Annually.

     uation drill.
     5.3.8. The Base Fire Chief or representatives can, in the interest of safety, conduct fire drills in any
     facility at his/her discretion. These drills will be coordinated with appropriate unit leadership to pre-
     vent having an adverse impact on the mission.
     5.3.9. Evacuations conducted in conjunction with a local exercise may satisfy the requirement for a
     normal fire drill. Facility managers should send a typed letter to the Base Fire Chief (435 CES/CEF),
     containing the date, time, building number and number of participants in the drill.
     5.3.10. The Fire Prevention Section, extension 480-5940/3338, is available to assist with fire drills
     when manpower permits.

17.1. Policy.
     17.1.1. Performance of good housekeeping standards relative to fire safety is the responsibility of all
     unit commanders and supervisors regardless of whether or not contract custodial services are pro-
     vided. Commanders and supervisors must ensure all buildings and grounds (including trash pickup
     areas) under their jurisdiction are maintained in a fire-safe condition at all times.
     17.1.2. Responsible supervisors must ensure all trash and waste containers are emptied into outside
     trash collection points immediately before securing a facility at close of business or at change of shifts
     and as conditions dictate.
     17.1.3. Trash receptacles must be appropriate for the waste they contain and the likelihood of catch-
     ing or spreading fire. For example, plastic receptacles are typically acceptable for ordinary office
     waste, but inappropriate for shop rags or sawdust.
     17.1.4. Storage is not permitted under stairways, in attics, boiler or mechanical rooms. Materials shall
     not be piled against buildings or in front of doors and exits.
     17.1.5. Outdoor trash receptacles, including dumpsters, packing cases, cardboard compactors, etc.,
     must be located 25 feet from any building and fire hydrant. They should also be kept clear of fire
     department access lanes.
     17.1.6. Clean and dirty rags must be stored in separately marked metal containers with tight-fitting
     lids.
     17.1.7. Sawdust and chips must be removed from all woodworking shops at the close of each work
     day. Under no circumstances will sawdust or sweeping compounds be used as an absorbent material
     for fuel, oils or other flammables. Only approved sweeping compounds shall be used. Bags of sweep-
     ing compound that have been opened for use must be stored thereafter in a closed container.
     17.1.8. Janitorial closets shall not be used as trash collection points. Closets must be kept clean and
     used for janitorial supplies only.
     17.1.9. Solid linen, of any type, must be kept in closed metal containers.

                    SMOKING AND DISPOSAL OF SMOKING MATERIALS

18.1. Policy.
   18.1.1. The majority of fire incidents result from unsafe smoking practices. Fires of this type, partic-
   ularly in dormitories and family housing, expose personnel to possible injury and death. Firm control
   measures are required to prevent this fire cause.
   18.1.2. Smoking in most AF facilities is strictly forbidden. Smoking is allowed in permanent living
   quarters to include family housing and unaccompanied quarters. Smoking is also allowed in facilities
   with approved waivers through the German Works Council. Copies of waivers must be kept on file
   with the facility manager. Smoking is not allowed within 50 feet of any exterior opening into a build-
   ing (doors, windows or vents). Designated smoking areas will not be allowed within 15 feet of any
   exterior opening (doors, windows or fresh air vents) into a facility.
   18.1.3. “No Smoking” signs shall be prominently posted in all areas where fire, explosive or safety
   hazards exist.
   18.1.4. Smoking in bed is prohibited.

   18.1.6. Smoking, striking matches and the use of mechanical lighters are not permitted within 50 feet
   of aircraft, Liquid Oxygen (LOX) carts, hangars, nose docks, paint and dope shops and refueling vehi-
   cles or within 100 feet of gasoline and jet fuel storage, fuel pump houses and dispensing areas.
   18.1.7. Smoking materials must be disposed of in noncombustible receptacles provided for this pur-
   pose. Do not mix with other waste. To alleviate potential trash problems, insert a clasp and padlock on
   each butt can and drill cigarette or cigar size holes in the top. Supervisors will ensure the contents of
   these receptacles are completely extinguished (wetted) before they are disposed of into outdoor trash
   pickup points. When emptying butt cans, fill a plastic bag half way with water, empty cigarette butts
   into the bag and then dispose of properly.
   18.1.8. Supervisors are responsible for providing suitable noncombustible ashtrays in areas where
   smoking is authorized. Ashtrays must be emptied into receptacles provided for that purpose and not
   into waste baskets.

            FIRE SAFETY DEFICIENCY (FSD) EXPLANATIONS AND WORKSHEET

A2.1. Purpose: The FSDs require an object analysis to determine the priority required for the corrective
action. They are prioritized according to their seriousness. Each identified FSD requires an appropriate
code be assigned. These codes (I, II, III, IV or V) are used to prioritize the FDSs for correction. These
codes are used in the same manner as RACs.

A2.2. Code I— A severe deficiency that would result in a catastrophic loss of mission capability, facility
or contents or high loss of life.

A2.3. Code II— A serious deficiency that would have a significant impact on mission capability, facility
or contents or a significant probability of loss of life.

A2.4. Code III— A deficiency that may constitute a risk of life or property.

A2.5. Code IV— A deficiency that may contribute to only minor damage or a slight risk to personnel.

A2.6. Code V— A deficiency that has little impact on personnel, facilities or contents. Conduct an anal-
ysis based on fire probability and loss severity. This analysis cannot be used for establishing legal liability
relating to a fire incident.

A2.7. FSD WORKSHEET. Below listed is a sample of FSD Worksheet.
