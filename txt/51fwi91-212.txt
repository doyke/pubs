                                              Chapter 1

                                   GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Situation: Provide pilots with a safe operating environment to conduct both peacetime and
wartime operations by reducing the potential threat of wildlife strikes and maintaining our
combat capability.
     1.1.1. General: Bird activity is very dynamic, requiring continuous adjustment to
     established procedures. The potential hazard posed by birds is also very dynamic and
     requires subjective judgment. This plan cannot establish procedures for every situation.
     Good judgment and effective teamwork by all organizations is required to reduce the bird
     strike risk at Osan AB.
     1.1.2. Airfield and Local Area: Osan AB’s location makes it a very attractive habitat for
     birds. On the airfield there are several drainage ditches that potentially serve as roosting,
     food, and water sources. Directly to the north there is a major river, and in the local area
     there are multiple rice fields.
     1.1.3. Low Level Zone (LLZ) Flying Areas: The entire Korean peninsula is divided into
     LLZs used for low-level flying and has many features that attract a variety of birds.
     Traditional IR and VR routes do not exist. Therefore, the entire peninsula must be analyzed
     for its bird hazard potential. Coastal areas pose a greater hazard to aircraft due to the
     increased number of bird species that are indigenous to those surroundings. Tidal low lands
     used for agriculture characterize the western one-third of the peninsula. LLZ1 overlays this
     area and is used extensively by 51 FW aircraft. A major river flows through Kunsan
     northeast through LLZ1. Several large rivers flow from Seoul to Choongwon and the OP4
     area. Mountainous terrain characterizes the north and eastern parts of the peninsula.
     1.1.4. Pilsung Range: 51 FW aircraft use this range extensively. Pilsung is a mountainous
     tactical range and, although it is not as attractive to birds for loafing and roosting, large game
     birds such as pheasants and hawks live in this area throughout the year.
1.2. Plan Execution:
     1.2.1. The Bird Hazard Working Group (BHWG) is the primary instrument for
     implementing this plan.
     1.2.2. The BHWG: Collects, compiles, and reviews data on bird strikes. Identifies and
     recommends actions to reduce hazards. Recommends changes in operational procedures and
     serves as a point of contact for off-base BASH issues.
     1.2.3. Authority: The BHWG submits all recommendations to the 51 FW Commander for
     approval. Implementation is through the normal chain of command.
     1.2.4. Composition: The chairman, appointed by the Commander, is the 51 FW/CV. The
     Commander, or designated representative, of each tasked organization in Chapter 2 shall
     attend the BHWG meeting.
     1.2.5. Meeting Schedule: As a minimum the BHWG will meet semi-annually. Additional
     meetings will convene as necessary.
51FWI91-212 14 JULY 2011                                                                        5


   1.2.6. Meeting Agenda: The BHWG meetings may discuss, but are not limited to: local bird
   strike statistics, locally observed bird activity, local wildlife habitat management and
   modification, annual bird migration, local BASH Plan procedures and responsibilities, BASH
   awareness/education/training, flying schedule-bird activity conflicts, and changes to this
   BASH Plan. Additional topics may be discussed as needed.
1.3. Definitions:
   1.3.1. Wing Flying: This is determined by the weekly schedule distributed by the 51 OSS.
   It covers the time from the first A-10/F-16 takeoff to the last A-10/F-16 land. The
   Supervisor of Flying (SOF) declares the Bird Watch Condition (BWC) while on duty.
   Airfield Management (AM) declares the BWC at all other times.
   1.3.2. Peak Bird Activity: Osan lies on three major migratory flyways. The migration
   activity in these flyways is most active from March-May and August-October. A river just
   north of the airfield runs parallel to the runway. As many as 1,200 birds (ducks) have been
   observed in this area of the river during the winter season (November-February). During the
   spring and fall months (March-May and August-October) there are large numbers of egrets
   on and around the airfield. Phase I denotes low activity and is in effect during the months of
   November-February and June-July. Phase II denotes the peak activity season during the
   months of March-May and August-October.
   1.3.3. Bird Control System (BCS): System used to remotely activate propane powered bird
   scare cannons dispersed across the airfield. Control Tower personnel or the SOF can activate
   the system through the BCS software using the dedicated laptop computer. The control
   tower watch supervisor or a delegated person in the tower must approve any activation of
   BCS.
   1.3.4. BASH Team: Term is used for personnel authorized to conduct bird dispersal. This
   team is trained by the Birdman. The Birdman is the primary dispersal individual during his
   contracted work period. When Birdman is unavailable, AM has primary responsibility for
   bird dispersal duties. Any person trained in BASH duties may be on this team.
   1.3.5. Bird Remains Collection: All personnel handling bird remains will wear rubber
   gloves and a surgical mask. Non-fleshy bird remains (feathers, feet, beaks) taken from the
   aircraft or near the airfield following all bird strikes will be placed in a Zip-loc bag marked
   with date, aircraft tail number and names of pilot/ground crew who discovered the strike.
   Even the smallest of remains, such as feather fragments, blood, guts and similar pieces, can
   be used for positive identification and are not to be discarded. For splatter patterns, lightly
   dampen the area with alcohol, gently wipe with a paper towel, place in the bag and deliver to
   51 FW/SEF. All other bird remains will be sealed in double plastic bags and placed in
   regular outdoor trash containers.
1.4. Revision and Review
   1.4.1. This instruction will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary. Tasked
   organizations will propose all changes to 51 FW/SEF prior to 15 March. The BHWG will
   review proposed changes to this instruction during the spring meeting. 51 FW/SEF will
   prepare a draft incorporating recommended changes from the BHWG and all tasked
   organizations NLT 15 May. The draft will begin formal review NLT 20 May.

      2.5.2.4. Limit time in low-level training areas to the minimum required for training.
   2.5.3. Ensures BASH awareness is incorporated into wing exercises and training schedules.
   2.5.4. Ensures bird hazards are published in the Flight Information Publication (FLIP),
   General Planning (GP), and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Supplement, along with any
   operating hour restrictions and avoidance instructions as required.
2.6. Standardization/Evaluation (51 OG/OGV):
   2.6.1. Reviews new low-level areas or changes in existing low-level operations for BASH
   potential.
   2.6.2. Monitors pilot briefings on a regular basis to ensure BASH is briefed.
   2.6.3. Incorporates guidelines for declaring each BWC into the SOF training plan.
2.7. Quality Assurance (51 MXG/MXGQ):
   2.7.1. Contacts 51 FW/SEF when notified of a bird strike.
   2.7.2. Responds to bird strikes to investigate damage.
      2.7.2.1. If wing or unit safety personnel do not respond within 30 minutes, preserve non-
      fleshy remains and take digital photos of impact points/damage. Forward remains and
      photos to 51 FW/SEF.
2.8. Flying and Maintenance Squadron Commanders:
   2.8.1. Issues specific guidance, as needed, to maintenance personnel to execute the
   procedures of this plan for the following:
      2.8.1.1. Reporting of hazardous bird activity to the SOF, Tower, or Airfield
      Management. Particular attention should be given to the monitoring of possible roosting
      areas in the aircraft shelters/hangars.

 8                                                                 51FWI91-212 14 JULY 2011


2.9. Squadron/Detachment Flight Safety Officers/Representatives (FSO/FSR):
     2.9.1. Ensure pilots participate in the BASH reduction program by promptly reporting all
     bird strikes and hazardous conditions IAW this plan.
     2.9.2. Ensure AF Form 853, Air Force Wildlife Strike Report, BASH Reports are readily
     available to pilots for bird strike reporting.
     2.9.3. Brief pilots on seasonal bird hazards. Use movies, articles, and other information to
     maintain awareness.
     2.9.4. Monitors aircraft parking areas/shelters for possible roosting areas and notify 51
     FW/SEF of actual roosting areas.
2.10. Supervisor of Flying (SOF): Coordinate through the Tower Watch Supervisor (TWS) for
dispatch of the BASH team immediately for bird dispersal. Monitor activity for conflicts with
flying operations.
2.11. Airfield Management (51 OSS/OSAM):
     2.11.1. Conduct airfield checks to monitor the local bird conditions on a routine basis. AM
     has the authority to use a variety of pre-approved methods to control local bird activity.
     2.11.2. During the daily airfield inspections, AM personnel will:
        2.11.2.1. Look for any environmental conditions (grass height, standing water, etc.) on
        the airfield that could attract birds and report these conditions to 51 FW/SEF and 51
        CES/CEO. Particular attention should be given to the monitoring of possible roosting
        areas in the airfield environment.
        2.11.2.2. Remove dead birds and forward non-fleshy remains to 51 FW/SEF.
        2.11.2.3. Note and report any hazardous bird conditions to 51 FW/SEF.
        2.11.2.4. Complete bird activity log and forward a copy to 51 FW/SEF as bird activity
        dictates.
     2.11.3. Conduct a runway check anytime a bird strike is reported in the vicinity of the
     runway. The TWS will normally request this.
     2.11.4. Ensure enough AM personnel are trained as BASH team members for dispersal
     duties when Birdman is unavailable. This includes training on BCS equipment, bird
     dispersal and depredation.
     2.11.5. Provide secure storage of BASH equipment.
2.12. Air Traffic Control Tower (51 OSS/OSAT):
     2.12.1. Report observed bird activity to the SOF, AM and RAPCON.
     2.12.2. Issue bird watch advisories IAW FAAH 7110.65 and include BWC on the
     Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS) to alert pilots of significant bird activity.
     Include the location of the bird hazard if the birds are concentrated.
     2.12.3. Notify the BASH team for response to the bird hazard location if the birds are
     concentrated. Provide BASH team access to the runway/taxiways without undue delay under
     BWC MODERATE or SEVERE for bird dispersal.
51FWI91-212 14 JULY 2011                                                                          9


   2.12.4. Anytime a bird strike is reported in the direct vicinity of the runway, runway
   operations will be temporarily suspended until AM personnel can accomplish a runway FOD
   check.
   2.12.5. Provide pilots with updated information on bird hazards in order to make timely
   decisions with regard to flight operations when in the traffic pattern, especially during takeoff
   and landing phases. These actions will be coordinated with the SOF, time permitting.
   2.12.6. Approve requests for bird dispersal, including BCS activation, as traffic permits.
   2.12.7. Activate BCS prior to first launch and at the SOFs discretion during the flying
   window.
2.13. Base Civil Engineer (51 CES):
   2.13.1. Provide a Natural Resources Representative, or individual with similar qualifications,
   to the BHWG to monitor and advise the group of environmental modifications.
   2.13.2. Develop procedures for removal or control of bird attractants and food sources.
   2.13.3. Initiate surveys and write environmental impact assessments and statements as
   required.
   2.13.4. Correct environmental conditions that increase BASH potential.
   2.13.5. Utilize network of facility managers to report bird activities (i.e. roosting or
   loitering) inside airfield structures to 51 FW/SEF.
   2.13.6. Use land management practices that reduce BASH potential.
   2.13.7. Modify airfield habitat consistent with runway lateral and approach zone
   management criteria IAW UFC 3-260-01. Habitat reduction to reduce BASH beyond the
   1000’ distance criterion is desired and will further reduce BASH potential.
   2.13.8. Develop a long-range program in conjunction with other base improvements and
   modifications in an attempt to make the airfield unattractive to birds.
   2.13.9. Incorporate the following practices into the base Natural Resources Plan:
      2.13.9.1. Grass height management. Grass heights of 7 to 14 inches are mandated by
      AFI 91-202 within the airfield mowing zone boundary (see Figure 4.2.). Mowing will be
      conducted when the average grass height reaches 14 inches or when seed heads begin to
      develop, whichever occurs first. Grass must be cut before it goes to seed to discourage
      flocking species from entering the airfield. Begin mowing adjacent to the runway and
      proceed outward away from the runway to finish infield or outer-most grass areas. This
      will cause insects and other animals to move away from the runway. Coordinate mowing
      operations with periods outside of flying activity within the Osan aerodrome when
      possible.
      2.13.9.2. Broad-leaf weed control. Broad-leaf weeds will be kept to a minimum on the
      airfield.
      2.13.9.3. Planting bare areas. Bare areas are used by resting birds and grass will be
      planted as necessary.
10                                                                51FWI91-212 14 JULY 2011


     2.13.9.4. Fertilizing. Fertilizer will be used as necessary to achieve a uniform cover.
     Watering or irrigation will be used to enhance grass root production in newly seeded
     areas.
     2.13.9.5. Reducing edge effect. The airfield will be maintained as uniformly as possible
     to reduce the highly bird attractive zone between two distinct habitat types (e.g. brush and
     grassland).
     2.13.9.6. Leveling. High and low spots on the airfield will be leveled or filled as much
     as possible to reduce attractiveness to birds and to prevent standing water. This does not
     apply to drainage ditches.
     2.13.9.7. Dead vegetation such as brush piles, grass clipping piles, etc. and the cover it
     affords will be removed as soon as possible.
     2.13.9.8. Dead birds or other animals will be removed from the airfield to avoid
     attracting vultures and other birds. Non-fleshy bird remains from a potential bird strike
     will be forwarded to 51 FW/SEF.
     2.13.9.9. Pest Control. Invertebrates and rodents provide important food sources for
     many birds. 51 CES will periodically survey and reduce these pests when required.
     Control of insects, earthworms, rodents, frogs, etc. will be accomplished under the
     supervision of the entomology office.
     2.13.9.10. Drainage ditches. Ditches will be inspected regularly and kept clear and
     obstacle-free. Ditch sides outside the 300-foot distance from the runway centerline will
     be kept as steep as possible to discourage wading birds and emergent vegetation. At a
     minimum, vegetation will be removed in April and September and as often as necessary
     to maintain flow.
     2.13.9.11. Control waste disposal. Landfills are the most significant bird attractant.
     When identified to 51 CES, they will ask local authorities to operate local landfills
     considering the following methods, if applicable:
        2.13.9.11.1. Maintain a small working area to minimize exposed waste.
        2.13.9.11.2. Incinerate waste.
        2.13.9.11.3. Operate landfill as a pit or trench to limit bird access.
        2.13.9.11.4. Dump waste at night or during non-flying periods.
        2.13.9.11.5. Cover waste material immediately.
        2.13.9.11.6. Restrict birds with overhead wire barriers.
        2.13.9.11.7. Relocate putrescible wastes.
        2.13.9.11.8. Eliminate roosting sites.
     2.13.9.12. Bird-proof buildings, hangars, and aircraft shelters by blocking entry routes.
     If necessary, methods such as toxic perches, pellet guns, netting, night harassment, etc.
     will be used.
     2.13.9.13. Routinely seek the guidance and assistance of HQ PACAF concerning bird
     hazard reduction policies and guidelines.
51FWI91-212 14 JULY 2011                                                                       11


      2.13.9.14. As resources permit, perform bird fogging during peak migration seasons in
      coordination with SEF, AM, and Tower.
2.14. Tenant Flying Units (5 RS):
   2.14.1. Provide inputs to BHWG to improve the BASH program as it pertains to tenant
   operations.
   2.14.2. Responsibilities within the unit will mirror the responsibilities assigned in this plan
   for similar job titles.
   2.14.3. Report all bird strikes and send non-fleshy bird remains to 51 FW/SEF.
   2.14.4. All U-2 sorties require a U-2 SOF on duty. U-2 SOF will consider Osan BWC and
   then apply appropriate MAJCOM guidance to U-2 operations.
2.15. Public Affairs (51 FW/PA):
   2.15.1. Participate as required and upon request to provide a public information program
   designed to inform base personnel, dependents, and the general public of the hazards and
   costs of uncontrolled bird activity, and the measures being taken to minimize them.
   2.15.2. Provide visual information services (photography, broadcasting, graphics) to
   document bird strikes and related activities that cause damage equal or greater to that of a
   class B mishap.
   2.15.3. Deleted.
2.16. Command Post (51 FW/OCO):
   2.16.1. Make notifications as required.

                                           Chapter 3

                                         EXECUTION

3.1. General: This chapter describes the BASH operations at Osan AB. It requires an exchange
of information between ground agencies and pilots concerning the existence and location of birds
posing a potential hazard to flight safety. For flying restrictions during periods of heightened
migratory activity, see 51 FWI 13-201, Airfield Operations and Local Flying Procedures.
3.2. Bird Watch Conditions and Restrictions:
   3.2.1. BWC is a subjective assessment of the potential hazard of bird activity to flight
   operations. Careful consideration should be given to the activity level and proximity to the
   flight path of arrival/departure/overhead traffic patterns. The potential hazard posed by a
   single bird or flock of birds should be the driving factor in choosing the BWC.
       3.2.1.1. Low: Normal bird activity on and above the airfield with a low probability of
       hazard.
       3.2.1.2. Moderate: Increased bird population in locations that represent an increased
       potential for strike. This condition requires increased vigilance by all agencies,
       supervisors and caution by aircrew.
           3.2.1.2.1. Ranges/MOAs/LLZs: 1000’ AGL minimum. (500’ AGL minimum for
           helicopter flight outside of established landing zones).
           3.2.1.2.2. Osan AB Pattern: Low approaches are restricted to 500’ AGL and
           multiple patterns are limited to the minimum required to fulfill training requirements.
           Touch-and-go and formation takeoffs/landings require 51 OG/CC approval.
           (Helicopter formations are exempt from this restriction).
           3.2.1.2.3. Osan AB tactical departures and recoveries: Low tactical departures and
           low tactical recovery patterns require 51 OG/CC approval.
       3.2.1.3. Severe: High bird population on or immediately above the active runway or
       other specific location that represents a high potential for strike. Supervisors and aircrew
       must thoroughly evaluate mission needs before conducting operations in areas under
       condition SEVERE.
           3.2.1.3.1. Ranges/MOAs/LLZs: 3000’ AGL minimum. (1000’ AGL minimum for
           helicopter flight outside of established landing zones).
           3.2.1.3.2. Osan AB Pattern: Takeoffs, patterns, and landings require 51 OG/CC
           approval. Helicopters restricted to operational rescue missions or single-ship landing.
           3.2.1.3.3. Osan AB tactical departures and recoveries: Low TAC departures and Low
           Tactical Recovery Patterns are not authorized.
       3.2.1.4. BWC MODERATE or SEVERE at Osan does not mean all
       Ranges/MOAs/LLZs are the same. Also, a BWC for Ranges/MOAs/LLZ may be
       localized for a segment within that Special Use Airspace (e.g., Glove Lake area is
       SEVERE).
3.3. Declaration Authority:
 14                                                              51FWI91-212 14 JULY 2011


   3.3.1. Osan AB Pattern: Inside of the 51 FW flying window, the SOF can raise or lower the
   BWC on behalf of the 51 OG/CC. Outside of the flying window, the TWS can raise or lower
   the BWC. The BWC is declared using inputs primarily from pilots, the 51 FW BIRDMAN,
   TWS, the SOF, AM and the BASH team. (NOTE: Inputs may come from anyone in the
   airfield vicinity, military or civilian.) These inputs will be funneled to the appropriate
   declaring authority for consideration. Contact the SOF at DSN 784-5110, commercial 031-
   661-5110 or TWS at DSN 784-2760, commercial 031-661-2760.
   3.3.2. Pilsung Range: The Range Control Officer sets the BWC on Pilsung range, and will
   include the BWC during initial check in or if the BWC changes while on range.
   3.3.3. MOAs/LLZs/Ranges (not including Pilsung): With the current lack of Avian Hazard
   Advisory System (AHAS) and Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on the Korean Peninsula,
   BWC status for MOAs/LLZs/Ranges (not including Pilsung) is exclusively based on PIREPs
   from the area. At the beginning of wing flying, the BWC for MOAs/LLZs/Ranges (not
   including Pilsung) will be set to LOW. PIREPs supporting a change in the BWC status
   should be passed to the SOF as soon as possible. The SOF will be responsible for changing
   the BWC status for these areas based on the PIREPs passed. Any BWC established in these
   areas will remain in effect until the SOF determines PIREPs support an increase or decrease
   in BWC for the designated area or Wing Flying is complete.
3.4. BWC LOW and MODERATE Operations: During his primary duty hours, the Birdman
patrols the airfield dispersing birds with tower’s consent. An active dispersal sweep of the
airfield takes 15-25 minutes. The SOF should work with the Birdman to perform a sweep before
wing flying launch and recovery windows. Spot dispersal takes 5-15 minutes, depending on
location.
3.5. BWC SEVERE Operations: The main focus during BWC SEVERE is bird dispersal.
The Birdman, if on duty, and AM will coordinate dispersal efforts. There may be several
dispersal teams on the airfield. With immediate access to taxiways and runways, the dispersal
should take 10-20 minutes to return the field to BWC MODERATE.
   3.5.1. During exercise conditions, BASH team members will remove their chemical
   protective mask and gloves only when loading and firing a weapon to disperse a bird hazard.
   This is to ensure safe operation of the weapon and to mitigate the risk associated with bird
   dispersal. Once the bird hazard is eliminated the team members will recover to exercise play.
   All BASH team members must be qualified to drive during MOPP 4 conditions in order to
   respond to bird activity during an exercise.
3.6. Notification Procedures:
   3.6.1. The primary means of transmitting the BWC is via ATIS. During periods of rapidly
   changing BWC, ATIS will be updated periodically, but will maintain the more restrictive
   BWC until conditions stabilize.
   3.6.2. The Declaring Authority will notify the AM of the BWC and complete the following
   actions:
       3.6.2.1. SOF.
       3.6.2.2. Notify TWS, AM and flying units of BWC and any subsequent changes.
       3.6.2.3. Notify airborne wing aircraft if BWC will affect normal recovery.
51FWI91-212 14 JULY 2011                                                                 15


     3.6.2.4. Notify Kunsan SOF and SODO if bird activity may preclude use of Osan for
     training or divert.
     3.6.2.5. Notify the 51 OG/CC of BWC SEVERE.
  3.6.3. Air Traffic Control:
     3.6.3.1. Update ATIS and notify RAPCON.
     3.6.3.2. Notify inbound aircraft of BWC SEVERE and expected delay.
  3.6.4. Airfield Management:
     3.6.4.1. Update the transient flight planning room.
     3.6.4.2. Notify TWS and 51 FW Command Post of all BWC.
     3.6.4.3. Notify 51 FW/SEF of BWC SEVERE.
     3.6.4.4. Transmit BWC in local NOTAM.
  3.6.5. Command Post:
     3.6.5.1. Notify the SODO and inbound aircraft of BWC above LOW and any changes.
  3.6.6. RCO:
     3.6.6.1. Notify SOF and/or AM of BWC above LOW and any changes.
     3.6.6.2. Notify each flight of BWC above LOW and specific hazard, if known.
  3.6.7. Flying Units:
     3.6.7.1. At step, brief aircrews on the current BWC for the airfield.
     3.6.7.2. At step, brief aircrews on any MOAs/LLZs/Ranges (including Pilsung) with
     BWC above LOW.
3.7. SOF, TOWER Procedures:
  3.7.1. SOF:
     3.7.1.1. During the morning runway inspection, examine the airfield for the presence of
     birds or conditions favorable for birds (grass height, standing water, etc.).
     3.7.1.2. Continually monitor the airfield for bird activity.
     3.7.1.3. Monitor the BWC in accordance with Chapter 3.
     3.7.1.4. Coordinate through the TWS for BASH team bird dispersal and monitor for a
     timely response. Assist the TWS in building ―holes‖ in the wing flying window for
     dispersal.
     3.7.1.5. During BWC MODERATE or SEVERE, coordinate with the TWS for ways to
     minimize exposure to bird hazards such as changing runways, delaying takeoffs/landings,
     or diverting aircraft.
  3.7.2. Tower:
     3.7.2.1. Continually monitor the airfield for bird activity.
16                                                               51FWI91-212 14 JULY 2011


     3.7.2.2. Assist the BASH team as they respond for bird dispersal. Coordinate timing and
     create "holes" in airfield traffic to allow dispersal activities.
     3.7.2.3. Proactively utilize BCS on a non-interference basis with other ATC duties.
     Activation of BCS may be the quickest way to disperse birds and will often preclude the
     dispatch of a BASH team. At night, during wing flying, program BCS for random
     cannon salvos outside of planned take-off and land windows. Due to poor visibility at
     night, random BCS salvos are optimal for preemptive bird dispersal.
         3.7.2.3.1. Prior to activating BCS, tower personnel will, time permitting, notify 51
         SFS. The primary POC for this notification is the Base Defense Operations Center on
         LMR/SFS Net 1. The Base Defense Operations Center can also be reached at DSN
         784-5515/4049.
  3.7.3. Pilot Procedures: Pilots who observe bird activity hazardous to flight operations will
  contact the SOF, tower, Command Post, or RCO with location, altitude, time, number, type,
  size, and activity of birds.
  3.7.4. Birdman/Airfield Management:
     3.7.4.1. Patrol the airfield during appropriate hours to locate and disperse birds and other
     wildlife. Respond to requests from ground control for dispersal at specific points around
     the airfield.
     3.7.4.2. Safely employ BCS, pyrotechnics, and shotguns to maximize dispersal and
     depredation activities while minimizing FOD, damage to the airfield, and damage to
     personnel or aircraft.
     3.7.4.3. Obtain tower approval prior to any form of bird dispersal.
     3.7.4.4. BWC SEVERE: Call for assistance and coordinate a dispersal plan using assets
     from 51 FW/SEF, AM and additional BASH team members.
     3.7.4.5. Birdman will coordinate with the AM when unavailable for dispersal during
     normal duty hours.
     3.7.4.6. Birdman will contact the Base Defense Operations Center when he is conducting
     bird dispersal. This is especially important during increased force protection conditions
     and Combat Employment Readiness Exercises.
  3.7.5. Threat Assessment: The following is a summary, in order of seriousness, of specific
  bird strike hazards at Osan AB and recommendations for reducing these hazards to flight
  operations. A brief description of each bird and methods of control/avoidance are provided.
  Each control measure has a corresponding tasked organization in the Basic Plan. Hazard
  control should follow a phased approach. Initial phases should focus on habitat modification.
  Follow on phases should consist of passive deterrents with subsequent phases incorporating a
  stronger method of deterrence/dispersal.
     3.7.5.1. Specific Hazards: (Osan AB area).
         3.7.5.1.1. Great White Egret (Egretta alba).
             3.7.5.1.1.1. Hazards: This species provides a large threat to flight operations in
             the airfield area. A number of these birds will normally be scattered throughout
51FWI91-212 14 JULY 2011                                                                    17


           the airfield in the summer months. It feeds primarily on frogs. Although these
           frogs are dependent on waste for breeding, they appear fairly drought resistant.
           The Egrets seem to avoid areas on the airfield where grass is taller than eight
           inches because it makes finding food more difficult. They pose a very serious
           threat to aircraft due to their size.
           3.7.5.1.1.2. Hazard Reduction: Habitat modification to reduce the available food
           supply should be the most effective method. Draining standing water and keeping
           grass height at the tall side of the mowing scale can do this. Additional methods
           are harassment and dispersal techniques, including pyrotechnics, bioacoustics,
           reflective tape and netting.
        3.7.5.1.2. Little Egrets (Egretta garzetta).
           3.7.5.1.2.1. Hazard: This is the smaller version of the Egret family and feeds
           primarily on large insects and grasshoppers.
           3.7.5.1.2.2. Hazard Reduction: Similar to that for the Great White Egret.
           Spraying for insects eliminates their primary food source. This should be very
           effective.
        3.7.5.1.3. Ring Necked Pheasant
           3.7.5.1.3.1. Hazard: This species is most hazardous during takeoff, landing, and
           taxi. These birds have been observed running or flying low across the runway
           and taxiways. They appear to have become accustomed to the presence of
           aircraft, to the point that they will walk out and stand on the runway during flying
           operations. The POL farm (located on east-side of Osan) is a primary roosting
           area.
           3.7.5.1.3.2. Hazard Reduction: These birds are most effectively controlled
           through proper grass-height management. Do not allow grass to exceed 12
           inches, and eliminate brush and weed patches on the airfield, particularly when
           the plants are producing seeds. Pyrotechnics, gas cannons, and depredation can
           effectively disperse these birds.
        3.7.5.1.4. Flock birds (Skylarks – Alauda Arvensis, Sparrows – Passer Montanus,
        and Magpies – Pica Pica)
           3.7.5.1.4.1. Hazard: These birds provide a hazard to aircraft operations because
           of their flocking habit patterns. They travel from their roost, to food sources and
           to loafing areas in large groups. They have been observed moving from rice
           fields to small trees near the ROK encampments on the perimeter road.
           3.7.5.1.4.2. Hazard Reduction: Habitat modification and control techniques are
           the most effective. These include:
               3.7.5.1.4.2.1. Food removal/reduction by eliminating insects.
               3.7.5.1.4.2.2. Reducing the attraction of loafing areas, such as the perimeter
               fence and closely mowed fields.
               3.7.5.1.4.2.3. Eliminating sources of drinking water near loafing areas.
 18                                                               51FWI91-212 14 JULY 2011


                  3.7.5.1.4.2.4. Bio-acoustic or pyrotechnic        scare   actions   when   bird
                  concentrations become hazardous.
          3.7.5.1.5. Pintail Duck (Anas Acuta)
              3.7.5.1.5.1. Hazard: These birds provide a hazard because of the generally large
              number of birds and higher altitudes at which they fly. They are attracted to
              ponds, ditches, etc., particularly if these contain emergent or submerged
              vegetation for feeding, nesting or shelter. Resident ducks are most active at dawn
              and dusk when they move to and from feeding areas. Migratory ducks are usually
              most active from sunset to midnight.
              3.7.5.1.5.2. Hazard reduction: Steepen ditch banks and drain water sources.
              Remove vegetation from those areas where water continually pools.
              Pyrotechnics, bio-acoustics, reflective tape, netting and depredation may also be
              used to control these birds.
          3.7.5.1.6. Deer and Small Mammals
              3.7.5.1.6.1. Hazard: Osan AB does not have a large population of wild
              mammals. Deer, however, have regularly (though not often) been depredated or
              chased off of the airfield. These animals are smaller than US type deer and are
              similar in size to a medium to large sized dog. They are attracted to sources of
              water and areas of overgrown vegetation which they use as food sources and for
              cover.
              3.7.5.1.6.2. Hazard reduction: Maintaining airfield grass heights within 7-14
              inches will eliminate many food sources and deny these animals cover. When
              discovered on the airfield, these animals should be immediately removed to
              eliminate the risk of an aircraft collision with a larger animal.
          3.7.5.1.7. Other Hazards: The list above is not a complete list of all birds in the Osan
          AB area. Other resident/migratory species may create a hazard for which a
          combination of the above hazard reduction techniques may be used. Some of the
          other more common birds include:
              3.7.5.1.7.1. Gray Heron – Ardea Cinerea
              3.7.5.1.7.2. Barn Swallow – Hirundo Rustica
              3.7.5.1.7.3. White Wagtails – Motacilla Alba
              3.7.5.1.7.4. Jackdaws – Corvus Monedula
3.8. Hazard Reduction Methods:
   3.8.1. Manage the airfield environment to reduce the attractiveness to birds.
      3.8.1.1. Fill low areas on the airfield as material becomes available.
      3.8.1.2. Maintain all areas north of Taxiway F grass heights between 7-14 inches to
      discourage nesting and loafing areas and make it more difficult to find food.
      3.8.1.3. Keep drainage ditches clear to ensure proper drainage.
   3.8.2. Use appropriate methods to eliminate birds that are present in the area.
51FWI91-212 14 JULY 2011                                                                  19


     3.8.2.1. Pyrotechnics, bio-acoustics (gas cannons), and dispersal techniques: These
     should be used to remove roosting and loafing birds from the airfield. Coordinate with
     the TWS prior to dispersal. Move gas cannons periodically to prevent birds from
     becoming accustomed to their presence. Additionally, netting and reflective tape will be
     used to distract birds and eliminate roosting/feeding areas on the airfield.
     3.8.2.2. Depredation: When necessary, the shooting of birds and animals will be
     conducted (except protected species). The Chief of Safety will manage the depredation
     program. All personnel must complete the Air Force Shotgun Training Course prior to
     participating in depredation. Prior to depredation activities, the BASH team will review
     protected species material to ensure those species are not targeted.
     3.8.2.3. Training: All BASH team members will receive the Wildlife Hazard
     Management CBT annually. The CBT is designed to provide users with information that
     will allow them to better understand and practice wildlife hazard mitigation at military
     airfields.

                                     MAPS AND CHARTS

4.1. General: This chapter outlines the use of and requirement for maps and charts needed to
help implement the BASH program. 51 FW/SEF will maintain these maps and charts and may
combine them to eliminate duplication. All maps will be made by 51 CES and updated by 51
FW/SEF.
   4.1.1. Osan AB Habitat Map
   4.1.2. Low-Level Area Range Map
   4.1.3. Migration Route Map
   4.1.4. Airfield Drainage Map
   4.1.5. Osan AB Bird Depredation Area Map
4.2. Osan AB Habitat Map:
   4.2.1. A habitat survey was conducted at Osan AB in 2006 to determine the specific habitats
   available to birds.
   4.2.2. 51 CES and 51 FW/SEF will conduct a survey to identify major habitat types
   available to birds. A habitat map will be made on this survey.
   4.2.3. Once a specific hazard is identified and the location of the activity can be isolated, the
   habitat study should be referenced to determine if a specific attractant to the species exists,
   and whether this attractant could be influenced within the scope of this program.
4.3. Low-Level Area Range Map: A small-scale map depicting the locations of bird strikes in
areas utilized by 51 FW aircraft.
   4.3.1. This map should be used to identify those areas that have a higher potential for bird
   strikes.
   4.3.2. Use data from this map to recommend changes to or restrictions on flying in high-risk
   areas.
4.4. Migration Route Map: A small-scale map depicting migratory patterns in Korea.
   4.4.1. This map should be used to monitor migratory patterns near Osan AB.
   4.4.2. At present, the only map available is a small scale drawing from the USAF Safety
   Center BASH Home page.
4.5. Airfield Drainage Map
   4.5.1. Identifies low-lying areas on the airfield that present a drainage problem.
   4.5.2. These areas are scheduled to be filled in when funding and manpower allows.

                                  INCIDENT REPORTING

5.1. General: This chapter outlines the procedures and forms required to report bird strikes
IAW AFI 91-204 and AFPAM 91-212. Accurate reporting of all bird strikes will enhance the
Osan AB BASH program.
5.2. Bird Strike Reporting:
   5.2.1. Maintenance personnel discovering a bird strike will notify QA, 51 MOS/MXOOM
   (MOC), and the respective flying squadron operations. QA and MOC will notify 51 FW/SEF
   immediately. This is required to ensure evidence and any remains are preserved for bird
   identification. No maintenance work will be accomplished in the area of the bird strike until
   QA and 51 FW/SEF have investigated the incident. If a strike is discovered after wing
   flying, QA (local aircraft) or AM (transient aircraft) will collect non-fleshy remains and take
   photos of impact points/damage. If unable to accomplish this, they will make arrangements
   to preserve the evidence until 51 FW/SEF can respond the next duty day.
       5.2.1.1. In the event that maintenance discovers the strike and the aircrew was unaware,
       the squadron Ops Sup and Assigned Flight Safety Officer will be responsible for ensuring
       the aircraft commander completes the AF Form 853, IAW para 5.3.1. If the aircrew is
       not assigned to Osan AB, 51 FW/SEF will ensure form completion.
   5.2.2. Bird strikes to tenant unit or transient aircraft will be investigated and reported by the
   flight safety office of the organization credited with the aircraft flying hours IAW AFI 91-
   204. The 51 FW/SEF will assist as needed. The unit flight safety office will send an
   information copy of the preliminary and final investigation reports to 51 FW/SEF for
   inclusion in its BASH database. Bird strikes that cause reportable aircraft damage greater
   than $50,000 require additional reporting IAW AFI 91-204.
5.3. Flight Incident Report:
   5.3.1. Report all bird strikes, damaging and non-damaging, using AF Form 853. 51 FW/SEF
   will ensure sufficient copies are available to all flying units and AM. Unit FSO/FSRs will
   provide copies to their respective maintenance debrief.
   5.3.2. The pilot involved in a bird strike will fill out an AF Form 853 report providing as
   much information as possible concerning the circumstances of the incident. Include
   additional comments in the remarks section to help establish the time and location of strike.
   The pilot will give the report to the unit FSO who will forward a copy to 51 FW/SEF.
   Transient pilots will give the worksheet to AM who will forward to 51 FW/SEF.
