SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Purpose. This Supplement assigns center-specific roles and responsibilities for implementing systems
engineering processes to provide and sustain, in a timely manner, cost-effective systems, subsystems and
end-items that are operationally safe, suitable and effective. It also provides additional guidance related to
sustainment processes in the preparation of Systems Engineering Plans (SEP) in order to capture the plan-
ning, trade studies and decision-making involved in the modification, upgrade or routine sustainment of
fielded weapon systems, subsystems, and end-items. This Supplement applies to all OO-ALC organiza-
tions and supporting organizations that develop, produce, integrate, test, modify, field, operate, maintain,
sustain and support operational systems, subsystems, and end items managed by OO-ALC. All refer-
ences, acronyms and abbreviations, and terms mentioned in this Supplement are listed in Attachment 8
(Added), Glossary of References and Supporting Information. Ensure that all records created as a result
of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will con-
vert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/. Refer recommended changes
and questions about this publication to the office of primary responsibility (OPR) using AF IMT 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication.
1.1.2.1. (Added) The System Program Manager (SPM) assigns OSS&E functions, through documented
agreements (Memorandum of Understanding, Memorandum of Agreement, Service Level Agreement), to
the System Support Manager (SSM), Product Group Manager (PGM), Commodity Manager or Supply
Chain Manager (SCM) for post-Milestone C activities. In the absence of documented agreements, SSMs,
PGMs and SCMs are accountable for fully implementing life cycle systems engineering to assure OSS&E

for the systems, subsystems and end-items over which they have engineering and program execution
authority. Disciplined systems engineering processes apply at all phases of the program.
1.1.4. (Added) The Wing or Group Director of Engineering fulfills the responsibilities of the CE/LE in
the absence of the CE/LE.
1.2.1.6.1. (Added) SoS engineering deals with planning, analyzing, organizing, and integrating the capa-
bilities of a mix of existing and new systems into a SoS capability greater than the sum of the capabilities
of the constituent parts. An example of a SoS would be a combat aircraft. The SoS in this case would be
the airframe, engines, radar, avionics, etc. that make up the entire combat aircraft capability. The consid-
eration of system of systems engineering should include the following factors or attributes:
Larger scope and greater complexity of integration efforts;
Collaborative and dynamic engineering;
Engineering under the condition of uncertainty;
Emphasis on design optimization;
Continuing architectural reconfiguration;
Simultaneous modeling and simulation of emergent system of systems behavior; and
Rigorous interface design and management
1.2.1.6.2. (Added) A FoS is basically a grouping of systems having some common characteristic(s). A
family of systems does not create capability beyond the additive sum of the individual capabilities of its
member systems.

2.7.8.1. (Added) Examples of product support improvements include performing an overhaul vs. repair,
changing maintenance plans, improving off-aircraft diagnostic capabilities, transitioning to a commercial
supply chain management system, etc.
2.7.11. (Added) In addition to the DoD recommended SEP outline in Figure 2.1, Figure A7.1. in Attach-
ment 7 (Added) provides a modified outline including sustainment activities that must be considered in
the planning process and included in the SEP as applicable.
2.8.5.1. (Added) Continuous evaluation of system, subsystem and end-item performance is conducted by
using fielded performance data from Air Force maintenance systems such as the Reliability and Maintain-
ability Information System (REMIS), Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS), and Defense
Repair Information Logistics Server (DRILS), as well as from deficiency reports, maintenance reports,
AFMCI63-1201_HILLAFBSUP 28 JUNE 2007                                                                          3


accident investigation reports, contractor databases etc. The analysis of fielded performance data should
result in appropriate sustainment actions to prevent OSS&E degradation.
