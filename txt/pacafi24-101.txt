SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Changes include more
clearly outlining levels of Responsibilities; defining procedures for Administration and Logistics;
clarifies Funding procedures; revises Training requirements; and updates the Combat Mobility
Elements to reflect their new structure as Flights.
1. Responsibilities. Commander, U.S. Pacific Command (CDRUSPACOM) exercises
combatant command of all theater assigned and attached airlift assets. Control of these assets is
exercised by the Commander, Pacific Air Forces (COMPACAF). HQ PACAF has primary
 2                                                               PACAFI24-101 19 JUNE 2012


responsibility to support C-130/C-17 tactical airlift operations in the Pacific Theater. HQ
PACAF will exercise operational planning in conjunction with its Numbered Air Forces: 5th Air
Force, Yokota AB, Japan; 7th Air Force, Osan AB, Korea; 11th Air Force, Elmendorf AFB,
Alaska; and 13th AF, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. HQ AMC is responsible for providing resources
required to meet USTRANSCOM and theater USPACOM airlift and tanker requirements in
accordance with the DoD mission priority system.
     1.1. While deployed in the theater during peacetime, CMF responsibilities include support of
     real world contingencies, JCS/PACAF exercises, PACAF C-130/C-17 Special Assignment
     Airlift Missions (SAAMs), and humanitarian assistance/disaster relief mission support.
     1.2. At home station, during peacetime, CMF’s are responsible to support PACAF C-130/C-
     17 unilateral airdrop and airland training.
        1.2.1. CMF’s will prepare, rig, and inspect Air Force supplies and equipment for PACAF
        assigned airdrop missions and unilateral airdrop/airland training. Current Rigging T.O.s
        will be available and used in load rigging/buildup areas.
        1.2.2. CMF’s will inspect and repack unit assigned cargo parachutes and rigging
        equipment. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) will be accomplished between the
        CMF and the respective base agency to repair cargo parachutes.
        1.2.3. CMF’s will recover unilateral airdrop training loads, bundles, and associated
        equipment from the drop zone (DZ). Airdrop training loads must be recovered from the
        DZ as soon as possible following each training mission to reduce the risk of loss or
        damage. Note: As a very last resort, CMF’s can coordinate with the user to have bundles
        recovered by the Drop Zone Control Officer (DZCO)/Combat Control Team (CCT), or a
        designated representative.
2. Mission. Combat Mobility Flights are highly trained, self-sufficient, mobile teams that
provide limited aerial port airdrop/airland support capability. One of the primary functions of the
CMF is to establish and operate non-fixed air terminals at employment sites where no permanent
air terminal organization exists. The limited amount of CMF personnel in the command does not
allow the CMF to participate in long-term sustainment operations other than AEF rotations as
required.     If a situation exists where long-term sustainment appears imminent, HQ
PACAF/A4RDC will look to the Air Expeditionary Force Center (AEFC) for relief.
     2.1. CMF’s are wartime tasked to provide rapid response capability within theater, upon
     Operational Plan (OPLAN) execution. To that end, CMF personnel should not be involved
     in home station issues that have any chance whatsoever of occurring simultaneously with
     OPLAN execution, as the CMF resources will no longer be available for use. This includes
     wing deployment processes or base augmentation programs.
     2.2. Historical data about the CMF can be found in Attachment 2.
3. Execution. PACAF CMF’s provide CDRUSPACOM limited rapid airfield opening
capability IAW their Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statement. All are OPLAN tasked,
responsible for initial air transportation reception (stand-up) at various Collocated Operating
Bases (COBs) on the Korean peninsula.
     3.1. CMF’s are a theater resource and as such, sole tasking authority for specific missions
     remains with HQ PACAF/A4RDC.
PACAFI24-101 19 JUNE 2012                                                                       3


   3.2. During peacetime, CMF’s will respond to theater short notice deployment requirements
   (contingency or other), at the direction of HQ PACAF/A4RDC.
   3.3. While deployed, PACAF CMF’s will support strategic and tactical airlift operations,
   including PACAF C-130/C-17 unilateral airdrop/airland training IAW DoD mission and/or
   theater COMPACOM priorities.
      3.3.1. PACAF CMF’s can operate with or without a Contingency Response Group
      Element (CRGE). When deployed with a CRGE they fall under the operational control of
      that CRGE regardless of MAJCOM affiliation.
   3.4. Due to the scope of their mission, the need to travel via military and/or commercial
   means, and vast geographical area of responsibility, official passports are essential to ensure
   uninterrupted support and mission accomplishment.
4. Tasking Process.
   4.1. HQ PACAF/A4RDC is the sole tasking authority for CMF personnel and equipment in
   support of theater contingencies/exercises. PACAF installations will coordinate CMF
   requirements with 13 AF/A4 or associated NAF, who in-turn will contact A4RDC for
   validation and sourcing of the appropriate CMF (s). A4RDC will coordinate with AEFC or
   AMC for augmentation if unable to support with PACAF CMF resources.
   4.2. HQ AMC may request to use PACAF CMF’s for JCS exercises within the Pacific AOR
   when AMC and PACAF agree to do so in terms of mission effectiveness and cost.
   TACC/XOPM will coordinate directly with PACAF/A4RDC for availability planning.
   Flights will be sourced by HQ PACAF/A4RDC.
   4.3. CMF personnel at each location are AEF postured in tempo band blocks and are subject
   to taskings for all three blocks. HQ PACAF/A4RDC will determine a CMF’s ability to
   effectively and efficiently support an AEF requirement.
5. Vehicles/Equipment.
   5.1. Equipment to support all taskings will, as a general rule, be derived from CMF’s
   themselves or either theater and/or CONUS war reserve materials (WRM) stocks. During
   exercise planning, if use of WRM is determined necessary, approval must be obtained as
   described in AFI 25-101, Chapter 6.. If theater equipment is not available, requirements will
   be requested through TACC/XOPM.
   5.2. The CMF VCNCO will manage assigned vehicles. Due to their unique mobility
   mission, a close liaison between the wing vehicle control officer/vehicle control NCO
   (VCO/VCNCO) and squadron/group VCO/VCNCO are required to maintain a successful
   vehicle management program.
   5.3. . PACAF/A4RDC and PACAF/A4RV will determine the requirement for a vehicle
   mechanic and TMSK based on the duration and nature of the mission and the type of MHE
   deployed.
   5.4. Tasked vehicles and MHE must receive a Limited Technical Inspection (LTI) from the
   host vehicle management flight prior to deployment. All tasked equipment must deploy with
   appropriate Technical Orders (T.O.) and Temporary Mission Support Kit (TMSK) IAW AFI
   24-302, Vehicle Management) as determined by PACAF/A4RDC and PACAF/A4RV. Upon
 4                                                                PACAFI24-101 19 JUNE 2012


     receipt of deployment tasking, TMSK w/30 day supply of parts will be built for deploying
     vehicle/MHE assets.       Responsibility begins with unit VCO/VCNCO through close
     coordination with base transportation.
NOTE: T.O.’s and Logistics Detail (LOGDET) items will remain with deployed vehicles and
MHE. These assets will be returned to the owning unit when the vehicle or equipment is returned
to home station.
     5.5. CMF vehicles/equipment will not remain at a deployed location upon TDY completion.
NOTE: Unless assigned to a specific equipment UTC, electronic, computer, and other unit
equipment will be rotated with the assigned unit. Each deploying unit will furnish its own
capability unless the original capability was theater-furnished. This will ensure the unit
redeploying is properly equipped to handle subsequent deployment requirements.
6. General.
     6.1. Assigned personnel who have completed the Joint Airdrop Certification Course or
     Fabrication of Aerial Delivery Loads Course are authorized to perform parachute packing,
     rigging duties, and certify airdrop loads using DD Forms 1748, Airdrop Inspection Record,
     Joint (Platforms)/1748-1, Airdrop Inspection Record, Joint (Containers).
     6.2. Personnel Utilization. Work schedules for deployed aerial port operations are based on
     individuals working l2-hour shifts. Adverse climatic conditions may dictate shorter work
     periods. After completion of a continuous duty period, commanders and supervisors must
     ensure personnel are provided a rest period of sufficient duration to allow a minimum of 8
     hours uninterrupted sleep.
     6.3. CMF personnel will use proper safety/professional equipment (hearing protection,
     gloves, reflective belts/vests, etc.) when loading/unloading aircraft or performing drop zone
     operations.
7. Fleet Service.
     7.1. The functions of fleet service in a deployed environment are usually minimal. If a fleet
     service function cannot be fulfilled by contract and PACAF support for the requirement is
     requested, the provisions of AMCI 24-101, Volume 10, Military Airlift-Fleet Services,
     should be followed as closely as possible. These provisions may be modified to meet local
     requirements or capabilities.        However, units must ensure sanitary handling of
     food/beverages is accomplished through a segregation of duties.
8. In-transit Visibility.
     8.1. In-transit visibility (ITV) is an integral part of aerial port operations. UTC’s have been
     created to ensure ITV capability for deployed aerial port forces is available to fully support
     Combatant Commanders. This capability will document all cargo and passengers moving in
     the air portion of the Defense Transportation System (DTS) IAW AFI 24-238, In-Transit
     Visibility . In situations where connectivity cannot be achieved, coordinate with HQ
     AMC/A4TI for approval to submit data to the AMC ITV cell. With AMC/A4TI
     concurrence, submit manual or automated cargo/passenger manifest to the AMC ITV cell.
     Manifests will be sent via telephonic voice or fax, along with verifying receipt of submission
     by the ITV cell.
PACAFI24-101 19 JUNE 2012                                                                      5


   8.2. CMF’s will be trained, equipped and qualified to capture In-transit Visibility (ITV) data
   for deployed cargo and passengers.
9. Administration and Logistics.
   9.1. PACAF Combat Mobility Flights are administratively assigned to the 773rd Logistics
   Readiness Squadron, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska; 647th15th Logistics Readiness Squadron,
   Hickam AFB, Hawaii; and 374th Logistics Readiness Squadron, Yokota AB, Japan.
   9.2. Though administratively assigned to a home station wing, CMF personnel will not be
   tied/committed to any base deployment process or augmentee program other than duties
   required to augment/enhance installation security (i.e., Gate Guard, EET duties) during
   peace-time. CMF personnel can be used as subject matter experts or technical advisors for
   the base deployment process. Performance of these duties will/can not interfere with any
   Wing unilateral airdrop training, theater exercise, contingency or real-world deployment
   initiatives supported by the CMF.
      9.2.1. During wing deployment exercises and if available, CMF personnel and
      equipment UTC’s should be tasked to deploy. When not tasked to deploy, personnel can
      perform Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) duties or technical advisors as long as the
      duties do not interfere with Wing unilateral airdrop training preparation or execution.
   9.3. IAW PACAF Sup 11-401, Attachment 3, CMF personnel may be authorized Mission
   Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP) status.
   9.4. CMF superintendents (Senior ranking enlisted member) will monitor current and
   projected TDY requirements for impact on C-17/C-130 aircrew and CMF personnel training.
   Superintendents will coordinate with Current Ops Schedulers to deconflict projected training
   mission support with personnel/MHE availability.
   9.5. CMF superintendents will provide HQ PACAF/A4RDC with monthly passenger/cargo
   workload data and personnel, equipment, and vehicle availability status using the Monthly
   CMF Status Report (RCS:PAF-A4R(M)0202)(Attachment 3) submitted to HQ
   PACAF/A4RDC NLT the 10th of every month.
      9.5.1. CMF superintendents will submit a DD Form 1748-3, Joint Airdrop Summary
      Report, to the Aerial Delivery and Field Services Department (ADFSD) NLT the 10th of
      every month. http://www.quartermaster.army.mil/adfsd/adfsd_main.html
   9.6. CMF personnel, by virtue of their command-directed mission, are authorized access,
   upon coordination with the MAJCOM WRM monitor(s), and non-reimbursable use of WRM
   vehicles and MHE, as required, to comply with their taskings.
   9.7. CMF personnel frequently deploy on short notice in support of exercises, contingencies,
   and humanitarian operations to foreign countries. To sustain their rapid-response capability,
   90 percent of CMF personnel will possess an official passport.
10. Funding.
   10.1. In FY94, COMPACAF/CC approved the budget for initial issue of supplies and
   equipment. All subsequent supplies and equipment will be procured by the respective
   Logistics Readiness Squadron commanders through normal Base Operating Support funding
   procedures. ESP code “CM” will be used to track all CMF obligations.
 6                                                                 PACAFI24-101 19 JUNE 2012


11. Training. Each squadron commander exercising administrative command of CMF
personnel will ensure their mission readiness by:
     11.1. Maintaining oversight of OJT and formal training.
     11.2. Ensuring local host base tenant support agreements are continually updated to
     incorporate 2T2X1 core tasks and critical wartime training requirements as identified in the
     Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) with tenant Air Mobility Squadron
     (Aerial Port) capabilities.
12. Deployed Survivability.
     12.1. The ability to deploy assets, establish airlift support operations, and minimally sustain
     those operations in any type of environment, whether it be military operations other than war
     (MOOTW) or war itself, is critically important to the mission of all CMF units. Personnel
     selected to deploy to austere locations will receive just-in-time survivability training based on
     theater reporting instructions.
     12.2. Weapons.
        12.2.1. Theater reporting instructions also will be the determinant as to whether
        personnel should deploy with weapons. The standard weapon for all mobilized aerial
        port forces will be the M-16. Officers will have the option of deploying with the M-16
        and/or the 9MM.
        12.2.2. All weapons qualification standards for active duty personnel groups A, B, and
        C are IAW AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program. Arming groups A, B, and C are
        defined IAW AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force By Air Force Personnel. All CMF’s
        fall under arming group B.
        12.2.3. CMF’s are required to maintain weapons and report status IAW their unit DOC
        statements.
13. Communications.
     13.1. Mobility Land Mobile Radios. In order to carry out their wartime function, all CMF’s
     will have land mobile radio sets in their deployment inventory. Although these radios will
     primarily be used for exercises and contingencies, they may also be used on a daily basis for
     training. These radios must be positively controlled (inventoried), continually maintained,
     and ready for deployment at all times.
     13.2. Frequencies. Units must coordinate with their local frequency managers before they
     can operate any radio (UHF/VHF/FM/HF, etc.). For deployed locations, coordinate with the
     deployed Communications personnel and/or the responsible CRGE for deployed operations.
14. Physical Fitness Program.
     14.1. CMF superintendents will establish in-house physical fitness programs to be conducted
     at a minimum three times a week for all assigned personnel. Each exercise should begin at
     the basic level and increase in intensity as endurance increases.
     14.2. A higher level of physical fitness is essential to sustain airlift support operations in
     austere locations and keep pace with an increasing OPSTEMPO. Personnel typically are
PACAFI24-101 19 JUNE 2012                                                                   7


  required to work sustained 12-hour shifts while deployed and also be capable of sustained
  ops in chemical warfare equipment and/or body armor.
  14.3. Units will deploy with AF PT uniform and must continue to conduct physical fitness
  training according to paragraph 14.1.
  14.4. Each unit should consult with appropriate base medical staff to assist with developing
  their program. Physical Fitness assessments will be conducted IAW AFI 40-501, The Air
  Force Fitness Program.

              HISTORY OF THE COMBAT MOBILITY FLIGHT (CMF)

A2.1. Situation.
   A2.1.1. Background.
      A2.1.1.1. Theater force reductions in C-130 aircraft, aircrews, and ground support
      personnel have been ongoing since 1989. Yokota based C-130s were reduced by one
      airlift squadron (12 aircraft) in 1989 and another 4 aircraft in 1993 to a 16 aircraft
      squadron. The 8th Mobile Aerial Port Squadron was decommissioned in 1991 and AMC
      transferred control of COMPACOM-based C-130s to PACAF in 1992. AMC’s Global
      Reach Laydown Plan changed theater en-route ground support capability by designating
      East and West coast Air Mobility Operations Groups (AMOG), designed to provide an
      on-call response for theater airlift support. Establishment of the AMOG resulted in
      elimination of deployment/mobility capability from the en-route system in PACOM. Due
      to the geographical magnitude of the COMPACOM AOR, the time required to get
      ground support in-place often determines logistics feasibility of airlift operations.
   A2.1.2. Implementation.
      A2.1.2.1. PACAF/CC approved Combat Mobility Element (CME) manning and
      beddown locations on 1 April 1994.
      A2.1.2.2. HQ PACAF XPM/DPR loaded manpower on Unit Manning Documents
      (UMD) and allocated personnel to authorizations.
      A2.1.2.3. The first CME officially stood up at Yokota AB, Japan on 1 October 1994.
      Subsequent CME’s were activated at Osan AB, Korea, and Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.
      A2.1.2.4. The CME at Osan AB was transferred to Kadena AB, Japan in 1996 and
      subsequently transferred to Hickam AFB, Hawaii in 2005.
      A2.1.2.5. On 1 August 2008, as a part of the AF wide Logistics Readiness Squadron
      restructuring, all Combat Mobility Elements became Combat Mobility Flights.
   A2.1.3. General Background.
      A2.1.3.1. PACAF aerial port ground support is an integral part of theater airlift readiness
      and capability. Assignment of these personnel and equipment resources represents a
      logical evolutionary shift in conventional thinking regarding PACAF OPCON of
      COMPACOM’s theater C-130s. Previously, only the aircraft and aircrews came under
      COMPACOM’s COCOM. Transfer of the C-130s to PACAF was accompanied by
      operations, aircraft maintenance, and aerial port ground support personnel. Assigning
      “back-end” support to the theater commander is now seen as an integral requirement to
      ensure effective employment of theater assigned C-130s.
