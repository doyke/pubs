This Arnold Engineering Development Complex Instruction (AEDCI) implements the applicable
portions of the revised AFMCI 63-1201, Implementing Operational Safety Suitability and
Effectiveness (OSS&E) and Life Cycle Systems Engineering (LCSE), on organizational Systems
Engineering (SE) instruction requirements. This instruction assigns AEDC responsibilities and
provides implementing guidance and standards for organizational SE instructions for LCSE and
is subordinate to Department of Defense (DoD), Air Force (AF), Air Force Materiel Command
(AFMC) and Air Force Test Center (AFTC) instructions.

AEDC is complying with AF, AFMC and AFTC organizational Systems Engineering
requirements by implementing this operating instruction as an overarching SE instruction.
Organizational SE instructions subordinate to this AEDCI are AEDCI 63-100, Investment
Planning; AEDCI 90-700, Capabilities-Based Planning; AEDC-STD-SE-1, AEDC Standard
System Engineering; and AEDC-STD-CM-1, AEDC Standard Configuration Management.
These instructions implement disciplined System Engineering/Configuration Management (CM)
processes and practices from planning to design, checkout and validation, and through operation
and maintenance for existing, modification, and new acquisition development, production and
sustainment programs and projects.

These AEDCIs apply to the organizations for programs, projects and activities that result in a
usable system, sub-system, or end item. Hereafter, these instructions are referred to as
subordinate operating instructions (OIs).

The primary purpose of this AEDCI is to provide a framework to ensure that disciplined
organizational Systems Engineering processes, practices, and principles are applied. A key
premise of the AEDC SE policy is that SE should be executed at the lowest level possible based
on the complexity of the capabilities. A secondary premise is that AEDC will emphasize
commonality of SE practices through the sharing of best practices and tools. In support of these
premises, this instruction establishes the responsibilities and top level policy for the lifecycle
systems engineering (LSE) of the test capabilities and infrastructure at AEDC. This instruction
provides the overarching technical oversight of the test capabilities and infrastructure to ensure
the integration and compatibility of the various technical development and sustainment
efforts. This instruction is applicable to all test capabilities and infrastructure planning,
development, and sustainment organizations.

All “shall statements” in this instruction are mandatory unless waived. The waiving of
requirements in this instruction shall be coordinated with AEDC/EN.

Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with (IAW) AFMAN33-363, management of records, and disposed of
in accordance with the air force records disposition schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims/cfm. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the office of primary responsibility (OPR) using the AF form
847, recommendation for change of publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through the
appropriate functional chain of command.


1. Introduction
     1.1. This instruction implements applicable portions of the AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated
     Life Cycle Management, dated 07 March 2013, and AFMCI 63-1201, Implementing
     Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&E) and Life Cycle Systems
     Engineering (LCSE), dated 14 Oct 2009.
     1.2. This AEDCI provides overall policy and direction for implementing a consistent and
     effective approach to SE that is executable in a cost-effective and efficient manner and
     results in data/insight, products, services, and processes that meet stakeholder requirements
     throughout their life cycles. The AEDCI does not replace higher headquarters requirements
     but implements SE processes to applicable activities at AEDC. This instruction is intended
     to be compatible and to integrate with existing AEDC Government and Contractor SE
     processes. The intent is to establish the standard for implementing a uniform and effective
     approach to Complex-wide SE processes.
2. Applicability
     2.1. This AEDCI applies to the development of test capabilities and infrastructure managed
     by AEDC. Each organization at AEDC shall determine the extent to which formal SE
     processes are applied based on the cost, complexity, and technical risk. Tailoring of these
AEDCI63-3733 27 MAY 2014                                                                        3


   formal SE processes and activities is encouraged based on an assessment of applicable
   complexity factors and technical risk.
   2.2. This instruction is applicable to all programs, projects or activities for which AEDC has
   development or sustainment responsibility. This includes test facilities and infrastructure,
   test support systems, hardware/software, and tools. The implementation of the SE processes
   used should be tailored based on the tailoring criteria outlined in Project Technical Tailoring
   at Attachment 2 and Project Management Complexity at Attachment 3. The project technical
   tailoring is sometimes referred to as the SE tailoring and, in the same manner, project
   management complexity is sometimes referred to as project management process tailoring.
   2.3. This AEDCI has applicability to the modification of existing or the creation of new
   Configuration Items (CIs) and/or physical assets at AEDC, Arnold AFB, TN, to include
   geographically separated units located at Tunnel 9 at White Oak, Maryland, and the National
   Full Scale Aerodynamic Complex (NFAC) at Moffett Field, California.
       2.3.1. Modifications of physical assets imply form, fit, function, and/or interface
       modifications of an in-service CI that satisfies an end-use function and is designated for
       separate CM. The CI may be part of a test facility or plant, systems, sub-systems and
       items that are integral to the operation of AEDC ground test facilities. This instruction
       applies to permanent and temporary modifications that are related to both capability and
       sustainment requirements.
          2.3.1.1. A capability modification is predominantly accomplished in order to satisfy
          an operational mission requirement by adding a new capability or function, enhancing
          technical performance, or operational suitability of the asset. A capability
          modification usually results in a change to the existing baseline for that CI.
          2.3.1.2. A sustainment modification is predominantly accomplished to correct
          deficiencies or to preserve/comply with the baseline performance. Sustainment
          modifications may also include efforts designed to improve the operational
          availability of the item and reduce ownership costs. A sustainment modification
          results in a change to the product baseline and may also result in a change to the
          existing functional baseline or item performance specification for that CI.
       2.3.2. New physical assets imply the creation of new AEDC CIs and can include “green
       field” assets (i.e., entirely new facilities).

4. AEDC System life cycle
   4.1. The AEDC System Life Cycle is an adaptation of the Defense Acquisition University
   (DAU) Acquisition Life Cycle. It consists of five phases: Need Development, Acquisition
   Planning, Design and Delivery, Operations and Maintenance (O&M), and Disposal.
   4.2. Application of SE throughout an AEDC CI’s life cycle involves numerous technical and
   programmatic activities, the output of which forms the basis for funding and direction
   decisions.
   4.3. New CIs are developed using the System Life Cycle through the Design and Delivery
   phase. Existing AEDC CIs are in the Operations and Maintenance phase but may require the
   start of a new system life cycle if they are going to be significantly modified.
5. Requirements
   5.1. Tailoring of the SE Process
      5.1.1. The SE processes are designed to be tailorable and not all processes are required
      for all programs, projects or activities. Each functional organization that modifies or
      creates a CI will determine and document the extent of application of formal SE to their
      organization’s activities. Those activities that are determined to benefit from formal SE
      will follow the direction provided in this instruction and higher headquarters-level
      instructions and may follow a documented and tailored SE process for any items within
      this instruction that are not mandatory.
6                                                                AEDCI63-3733 27 MAY 2014


       5.1.2. The intent of the tailoring is to apply the appropriate level of systems engineering
       and to make decisions at the lowest level possible to ensure best value. Tailoring is a
       balance between cost, schedule, and technical risk. To this end, three types of tailoring
       decisions shall be made. The first is the tailoring of the required process steps, the
       second is the tailoring of the required supporting documentation, and the third is the
       decision approval authority. These tailoring decisions shall be based on a consistent set
       of criteria and will be approved at the level determined by these criteria. The
       determination of the amount of tailoring to be applied to the SE process for any selected
       activity shall involve an assessment of an effort’s risk factors to determine the required
       amount of SE necessary to mitigate risks in a value-added manner. The implementation
       of the SE processes used should be based on the guidelines in Project Technical Tailoring
       at Attachment 2 and Project Management Complexity at Attachment 3. Each functional
       organization that creates or modifies an AEDC CI shall document its approach to
       determining the SE tailoring to be applied. The factors that might be considered when
       tailoring include but are not limited to:
          5.1.2.1. Cost – Budget that must be defined to produce an optimal solution.
          5.1.2.2. Complexity – System engineering and CM such as requirements
          management, reliability, logistics, coordination of different capabilities and processes,
          evaluation measurements, and other similar disciplines become more difficult when
          dealing with large projects. Also used to determine technical and program risk.
          5.1.2.3. Integration - Number and intricacies of interfaces with other systems,
          organizations or technical disciplines.
          5.1.2.4. Mission Impact - Level of impact to a Test Cell, Plant, Utility or Service if
          capability is not delivered.
          5.1.2.5. Need Maturity - Level of understanding of the problem or need and the
          extent to which the concept of operations, requirements, and constraints have been
          defined.
          5.1.2.6. Technology - Level of technology required to deliver the product
          (technology exists or must be developed).
       5.1.3. For those activities determined by the organization to require formal SE, the
       following SE practices are required:
          5.1.3.1. Identification and documentation of requirements.
          5.1.3.2. Identification of constraints such as interfaces, environmental, safety, and
          codes; and plans to address each.
          5.1.3.3. Identification of potential alternative solutions and the selection of a
          solution.
          5.1.3.4. Verification checkouts of the installed product.
          5.1.3.5. The above items must be accomplished but are tailorable in their internal
          process, documentation, and approval.
    5.2. Technical Baseline Management
AEDCI63-3733 27 MAY 2014                                                                     7


      5.2.1. The technical baseline for a development effort is comprised of the data necessary
      to define the modifications to an existing CI or the configuration of a new CI. The
      technical baseline is evolved through the development effort and is periodically examined
      at identified milestone reviews and audits. Each functional area shall ensure
      development efforts establish and maintain the technical baseline by:
         5.2.1.1. Developing a standard methodology for managing technical baselines.
         5.2.1.2. Ensuring traceability of requirements throughout the development and
         refinement of the technical baseline—from the need development, acquisition
         planning, design and delivery, O&M, and disposal.
         5.2.1.3. Maintaining integrity of technical baselines.
         5.2.1.4. Conducting audits as required and delivering O&M procedures, drawings,
         and other CM documentation as appropriate for incorporation into the O&M baseline.
   5.3. Configuration Management (CM) Process
      5.3.1. CM is an integral part of the SE process which directly involves establishing and
      controlling baselines. The purpose of CM is to ensure consistency between CIs and their
      documentation through configuration identification and establishment of configuration
      baselines, change control, configuration status accounting and configuration audits and
      reviews.
         5.3.1.1. During the SE processes and activities defined in this document, the CM
         process applies to all documentation that is included as configuration identification
         information and tracked for baseline and change control.
         5.3.1.2. The CM process, as it applies to AEDC CMs that are in the O&M or disposal
         phase, is defined in AEDC-STD-SE-1. In addition to the requirements established
         within this document, the requirements of AEDC-STD-CM-1 shall be applied to all
         efforts within the scope of this document that create or modify an existing CI.
6. self-assessment and continuous improvement
      6.1. Air Force System Engineering Assessment Model (SEAM) shall be
      implemented in accordance with AFMCI 63-1201 and the SEAM Management
      Guide.

   6.2. AEDC Instructions pertaining to Acquisition and CM comply with the intent of AF-
   level guidance and shall be used by program, project or activity managers and quality
   assurance evaluators to manage AEDC infrastructure.

A2.1. Project Technical Tailoring. The objective of the Technical Tailoring (TT) is to assess
the level of systems engineering that will be applied to the project. TT Levels are defined in
Table 1 and have five different TTs such as TT1-TT5. Based on the project type and objectives,
the tailoring level will be selected; and the project manager will use the TT level to develop a
project plan that will contain the specific activities and deliverables for the project. Technical

A3.1. Project Management Complexity. The Project Management Tailoring is to select and
streamline AEDC’s project management practices based on the project complexity level (PCL).
As shown in Table 2, there are five complexity levels (PLC1-PLC5). The project management
practices include project justification and business case development, scope definition,
scheduling, cost estimating, etc. Utilizing the PCL determined from Table 2, the project
management processes will be tailored by the project manager to develop the project
management plan applicable to the complexity level. The plan developed by the project manager
will be reviewed by asset owners, project team, or a cross functional team depending on the PCL
level. Projects from a functional area may align with the different PCLs based on the project
characteristics as shown in Table 2. Project management practices will be tailored for the
 14                                                              AEDCI63-3733 27 MAY 2014


Initiation, Planning, Executing, Controlling and Closing process groups. The detailed definition,
criteria, and guideline for PCL tailoring are provided at Table 2.
A3.2. Project Management Complexity Definitions:
   A3.2.1. Management/Admin, Training, Support, (Pool) Projects - Projects that provide a
   fixed level-of-effort support that are scoped and budgeted based on an agreed level of effort
   and not scheduled beyond a level distribution across the execution period.
   A3.2.2. Preventative Maintenance, Small Corrective Maintenance - Projects executing
   defined preventative maintenance procedures, small corrective maintenance activities and
   scheduled training projects initially scheduled to a defined plan, but with significant
   execution schedule flexibility.
   A3.2.3. Analysis, Tech. Appl., Other - Specific tasks for analysis, technology application
   and other small efforts that do not require the level of definition and integration needed on
   larger projects.
   A3.2.4. Planning Projects, Studies - Projects and tasks to develop planning-only information
   or studies.
   A3.2.5. Support to AE, GFE Contractors - Projects providing support for AEDC integration
   of efforts contracted by the government with outside architect-engineering firms or
   contractors.
   A3.2.6. Repeat Test, Independent Tech - Test projects and independently funded technology
   test projects that are conducting testing operations similar to projects previously executed at
   AEDC and do not require extensive buildup or pre-test prep.
   A3.2.7. Repair/Replace/Modernization - Projects initiated to repair, replace or modernize
   existing AEDC facility capabilities or systems.
   A3.2.8. Large Corrective Maintenance - Major corrective maintenance efforts that require
   increased planning, definition and tracking due to the cost, schedule or other risk factors.
   A3.2.9. Infrastructure Repair/Replace - Projects to repair or replace existing AEDC base
   infrastructure including buildings, utilities and supporting systems.
   A3.2.10. New Test, Technology Development - Test and technology development projects
   conducting test and development activities that have not been previously performed at AEDC
   and require increased planning and coordination to mitigate performance risk.
   A3.2.11. Integrated Infrastructure Upgrade - Projects to upgrade or repair AEDC base
   support infrastructure that requires additional planning and coordination due to integration
   with test operations, test facilities or other risks.
   A3.2.12. Cap. Add/Incr I&M/CTEIP/etc. - Projects to add a new capability or increase
   performance of an existing AEDC test capability including projects funded by dedicated
   authorizations with increased process and support requirements.
