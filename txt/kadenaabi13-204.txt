      2.1.3.3. Procedures for Closing Taxiways. Taxiway closures shall be directed by the
      Airfield Manager or designated representative.
   2.1.4. Visual Blind Spots.
      2.1.4.1. Primary Control Tower. Taxiways November, Papa, and Kilo between
      Taxiways Echo and Foxtrot, Taxiway Hotel, Spots 1-50 on the UFR, and the intersection
      of Taxiways Juliet and Delta cannot be seen from the Tower. Tower cannot provide
      positive control for aircraft operating in these areas.
      2.1.4.2. Alternate Control Tower. The following areas cannot be seen from the Alternate
      Tower: The entire UFR. Taxiway Golf East of Taxiway Echo. The Northeast Connector
      and Taxiway Hotel. Taxiway Lima West of parking spot L-8 to Taxiway Alpha.
      Taxiway November West of Taxiway Charlie. Taxiway Papa West of parking spot P-11.
      Taxiway Charlie between Taxiway Lima and Mike. Parts of Taxiway Juliet are limited
      visibility when aircraft are parked on Service Apron 2 or parking spots 102-114. There is
      also an airborne visual blind spot on the North base for Rwy 23, especially for the Aero
      Club pattern.
   2.1.5. Exercise Runway and Taxiway Closures. The Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) Chief
   shall brief the AOF/CC 48 hours in advance of exercises that involve any ATC facility or the
   airport movement area. The AOF/CC must approve, in advance, exercises that include
   moving controllers to alternate facilities or to shelter areas. The AOF/CC will brief the
   Tower Chief Controller and/or Airfield Manager when deemed necessary.
      2.1.5.1. Coordination will include scenario details, timing, and portions of the airfield
      involved to ensure flight safety and effective support.
      2.1.5.2. The EET Chief shall coordinate with the AOF/CC for all simulations of taxiway
      and/or runway closures. The 18 OG/CC is the final approving authority for all
      simulations of taxiway/runway closures.
      2.1.5.3. The watch supervisor/senior controller (WS/SC) must ensure ATC facility
      participation does not degrade service. WS/SC shall interrupt or discontinue facility
      participation in any exercise if flight safety is in question or if it interferes with the
      recovery of emergency aircraft.
2.2. Runway Selection Procedures.
   2.2.1. The tower watch supervisor selects the runway in use based on Federal Aviation
   Administration (FAA) criteria established in FAAO JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control.
   2.2.2. Runway 23 shall be used as the calm wind runway (wind velocity is less than 5 knots
   and forecasted to remain so) in accordance with (IAW) noise abatement procedures.
   2.2.3. When conflicting wind information is received from the dual wind sensors, the Tower
   will continue to use the runway in use at the time the discrepancy was discovered.
   2.2.4. As soon as a runway change is anticipated, Tower will notify Naha Approach, Kadena
   Arrival, Ground Controlled Approach (GCA), AMOPS, Futenma Tower, Weather and the
   18th Wing MOCC (18 WG/MOCC).
   2.2.5. As soon as runway change has occurred, GCA will coordinate with Kadena Arrival to
   ensure no aircraft are currently utilizing the ILS equipment. The GCA will change the ILS
 12                                                     KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


   and PAR equipment to the current runway in use after confirmation that no aircraft are
   utilizing these systems. The GCA will immediately notify Kadena Arrival or Naha Approach
   as soon as equipment is aligned to the proper runway.
2.3. Controlled Movement Area (CMA). Operations in the controlled movement area require
two-way radio contact with and approval from the Control Tower. It is the area to include both
runways (05R/23L, 05L/23R), between the two parallel runways, overruns, centerline road,
Charlie Helipad located on Taxiway Charlie between Taxiway Kilo and Runway 05R/23L,
VTOL Pad located on Taxiway Charlie in between the runways, Rescue Helipad located on
Taxiway Charlie between 05L/23R and Taxiway Lima, Echo Helipad located at Taxiway Echo
between 05L/23R and Taxiway Lima, and any area within 100 feet of these areas (See Figure
A2.5).
   2.3.1. Procedures for vehicle/pedestrian operations on the airfield and CMA are contained in
   Kadena Air Base Instruction Supplement to AFI 13-213, Airfield Driving, including
   procedures in the case of radio failure.
   2.3.2. ATC Ground Communications. All UHF equipped aircraft must utilize Ground
   Control UHF frequency while operating at Kadena. This reduces the potential for separate
   aircraft to simulcast on UHF and VHF, provides aircrew improved situational awareness and
   improves Ground Control’s ability to receive and understand aircraft transmissions.
2.4. Airfield Lighting Systems.
   2.4.1. Runway 05L: Sequenced Flashing Lights (SFL), High Intensity Runway Lights
   (HIRL), Non-Standard (missing a station one centerline barrette) Category 1 System
   configuration with Sequenced Flashers (ALSF-1), and Precision Approach Path Indicators
   (PAPI).
   2.4.2. Runway 23R: HIRL, a Non-Standard (missing station one, three and four centerline
   barrettes 1,500’ in length) Simplified Short Approach Lighting System (SSALR) and PAPI.
   2.4.3. Runway 05R/23L: HIRL, Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL) and PAPI.
   2.4.4. Taxiway lighting is available on the entire airfield with the exception of Taxiways
   Golf (west end), Echo (south of Kilo), Mike, November, Papa and UFR have no taxiway
   lights. Aircrews must use extreme caution in these areas at night and during instrument
   meteorological conditions because of reduced lighting and the numerous vehicles operating
   there. 18 WG/CC has signed a waiver allowing 18 WG and partner/rotational units to
   conduct these operations. All transient aircrews will use transient alert Follow-Me services
   when taxiing in these areas.
   2.4.5. Runway Distance Markers. Standard runway distance markers are located 67 feet
   from the edge of pavement on Runway 05R/23L and 50 feet from the edge of pavement on
   Runway 05L/23R. Runway distance markers indicate runway remaining in 1,000-foot
   increments and are lighted for night operations.
   2.4.6. The airport rotating beacon is located on top of the Control Tower. Operators and
   airfield drivers should exercise extreme caution to not confuse the rotating beacon with
   Tower light gun signals.
2.5. Permanently Closed/Unused Portions of the Airfield. Hardstands 116, 118 and 333 are
permanently closed.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                 13


2.6. Aircraft Arresting Systems (AAS). Barrier Arresting Kit 12 (BAK-12) arresting system
―cables‖ on Rwy 05L/23R are suspended approximately 2" (5 cm) above the runway surface.
All BAK-12 ―cables‖ on the runway are secured with a 6-point tie down and are approved for C-
130 takeoffs and landings over them. For consecutive BAK-12 engagements, 30 minutes are
required to reconfigure and recertify the BAK-12 system. Emergency engagement procedures
are contained in Chapter 6 and Figure A2.6. BAK-14 arresting systems on Rwy 05R/23L are
suspended approximately 2‖ (5cm) above the runway surface and secured with 20-point tie
downs. For consecutive BAK-14 engagements, 30 minutes are required to reconfigure and
recertify the system back in service. Note: All agencies concerned, such as FES, (18
CES/CEF), Barrier Maintenance, Crash Recovery, etc., will develop procedures to ensure timely,
safe aircraft engagement and/or disengagement and restoration of the arresting system used.

          2.6.1.2.2. Barrier maintenance will notify 18 OG/CC of required barrier certifications
          at least two weeks prior at weekly 18 OG/CC scheduling meeting. 18 OG/CC will
          then approve times and assign squadron responsible to perform barrier engagement.
14                                                      KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


        2.6.1.2.3. The pilot, Barrier Maintenance, FES, Crash Recovery, Wing Safety and
        Airfield Management personnel will brief certification procedures prior to event to
        ensure all parties involved are properly trained, prepared and thoroughly understand
        process to complete barrier certification.
        2.6.1.2.4. Barrier certifications will be performed by taxiing aircraft, never landing.
        Pilots will set up to engage barriers to ensure ample runway is left for adequate
        braking if barrier is missed.
        2.6.1.2.5. The aircraft will shut down engines and be removed from the cable using
        tow procedures. ―Sling-Shot‖ procedures are not authorized. The FES Chief is
        designated as the on-scene commander, and will inform the pilot when the arrested
        aircraft’s tail hook is immediately clear of cable and it is safe to taxi. Note: The time
        to reset a cable after an engagement is normally 30 minutes. Because of this reset
        time, successive intervals on the same runway are time driven. The interval between
        successive engagements on the parallel runways is based on appropriate separation
        minimum as defined in FAAO 7110.65.
     2.6.1.3. Airfield Management will:
        2.6.1.3.1. Notify the airfield sweeper and Barrier Maintenance personnel of all
        engagements and the barrier system to be engaged.
        2.6.1.3.2. Inspect for tail hook damage to the system, tape sweep area and runway
        IAW applicable directives (UFC, AFI, etc).
        2.6.1.3.3. Ensure the airfield sweeper is positioned near the system to be engaged,
        awaiting instructions or release from on-scene Airfield Management personnel.
  2.6.2. Procedure for Navy and Marine Corps Coordinated AAS Usage at Kadena AB.
     2.6.2.1. These procedures apply only to Navy and Marine Corps aircraft use of barriers
     during landings dictated by winds and runway conditions. They are not for routine use or
     convenience. To preclude the use of these procedures, squadrons will base flying
     operations on forecasted weather. If heavy rains (and crosswinds, if applicable) are
     forecasted and the unit anticipates use of AAS, the unit will curtail/stop flying until the
     weather clears.
     2.6.2.2. When an aircraft commander or squadron determines the need for the AAS, the
     following procedures will be implemented NLT 20 minutes prior to engagement:
        2.6.2.2.1. The aircraft commander will notify Naha Approach or Kadena Arrival;
        his/her squadron representative will notify AMOPS. The verbiage used will be:
        ―This is a coordinated barrier/trap engagement request due to runway/weather
        conditions.‖
        2.6.2.2.2. Naha Approach or Kadena Arrival will notify the Tower.
        2.6.2.2.3. AMOPS will notify Barrier Maintenance and the FES. AMOPS will also
        notify Tower when operations are ready to begin.
        2.6.2.2.4. The FES will pre-position a Crash Fire Response vehicle and Command
        vehicle for the duration of the operation.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                               15


         2.6.2.2.5. Crash recovery or the FES will remove the engaged aircraft from the AAS,
         and Barrier Maintenance will prepare the cable for subsequent engagement. Rapid
         recovery is essential.
         2.6.2.2.6. AMOPS will conduct a runway check and report the status prior to
         resuming normal operations after each engagement and barrier reactivation.
         2.6.2.2.7. Runway 05R/23L will be used for this procedure. In circumstances of
         AAS malfunction or runway closure, the SOF or Tower watch supervisor will
         determine Runway 05L/23R availability, diverting aircraft to Futenma Airport, or
         other options.
         2.6.2.2.8. Crash alarm systems will not be activated as this is not a declared
         emergency. This procedure will only be used during non-emergency recoveries.
  2.6.3. Arresting System Maintenance Procedures.
     2.6.3.1. Scheduled Maintenance. To de-conflict AAS maintenance and the flying
     schedule, Barrier Maintenance will ensure Airfield Management receives two-week
     advance notice for any maintenance that will take the system out of service. Routine and
     scheduled maintenance will be performed outside wing flying hours and/or during
     periods of low flying. Barrier maintenance will accomplish 90 percent of all maintenance
     off the runway or inside the AAS facility to minimize adverse impact on Wing flying.
     2.6.3.2. Unscheduled Maintenance. Once identified, Emergency or Unscheduled
     maintenance will be elevated to Airfield Management and the associated AAS will
     immediately be called ―Out of Service.‖ Per Civil Engineering Operations, Emergency
     Work Orders must be completed within 24 hours. Emergency tape changes normally
     require in excess of four hours to complete and must be performed on the hard surface of
     the runway. As a result, this level of maintenance will be conducted outside flying hours
     or during extremely low periods of flying. In order to support flying operations, Barrier
     Maintenance may lower the cable on an AAS and airfield operations may be resumed by
     AMOPS.
     2.6.3.3. Tower will notify AM before releasing arresting systems to barrier maintenance
     for maintenance or configuration changes. AMOPS will NOTAM all arresting system
     outages and advise the Tower and 18 WG/CP of any changes to arresting system
     functionality/availability.
     2.6.3.4. Maintenance Hours. Normal duty hours are 0530L to 2230L. During surge
     operations, Barrier Maintenance duty hours are adjusted to 0400L-2230L. Daily
     maintenance must be completed prior to fighter aircraft departures. In order to meet
     mission requirements, Barrier Maintenance requires regular access to the airfield in the
     mornings for approximately two hours, prior to the first fighter aircraft departure. If a
     cable operation (raising or lowering the cable) is required after normal duty hours,
     Airfield Management will advise Barrier Maintenance and FES to respond. Once the
     BAK-12 and BAK-14 systems have been certified for the day, Fire Department personnel
     may raise and lower both systems without requiring an inspection by Barrier
     Maintenance personnel.
 16                                                         KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


   2.6.4. Arrestment System Indoctrination Briefing. Barrier Maintenance will provide
   indoctrination training on arresting system capabilities and procedures when requested by 18
   OSS/OSA or flying units. The briefing will include the location, capabilities, and procedures
   for all installed arresting systems. Prior coordination required.
   2.6.5. Barrier Removal for ―Cable Bird‖ Operations.
       2.6.5.1. Runway 05R/23L will normally be used for all ―Cable Bird‖ operations because
       of the BAK-14 system. Annotate ―Cable Bird‖ in the ―Remarks‖ section of the DD Form
       1801.
       2.6.5.2. If runway 05R/23L is not available, tower personnel will ensure all barriers are
       removed from runway 05L/23R prior to granting takeoff/landing clearance for all ―Cable
       Bird‖ missions. Tower clearance for takeoff/landing will include the phrase ―Barriers are
       down.‖ If the ―Cable Bird‖ plans practice approaches, the barriers will not be removed
       until the aircraft is ready to full stop, unless the pilot requests multiple touch-and-go’s for
       pilot proficiency, and it will not adversely impact other local flying. Note: Airfield
       Management must temporarily suspend/close runway operations when any unsafe
       condition affects runway operations (e.g., FOD, bird condition, arresting systems
       maintenance or configuration changes, airfield construction, pavement repair, etc.). The
       suspension/closure announcement will be accompanied with the time runway operations
       are expected to resume. Airfield Management will complete an airfield check and report
       the airfield status/runway condition prior to resuming operations. Suspensions are very
       short in duration, and are enacted typically to accommodate activities such as responses
       to in-flight emergencies, FOD, bird conditions, etc. Closures are normally for extended
       periods, such as during runway construction and repair activities.
2.7. Aircraft Parking Plan.
2.7.1. The following paragraphs designate the primary parking spots for 18 WG, partner
units, and transient aircraft. The Airfield Manager will re-designate parking spots when
contingency or real-world priorities require the use of assigned parking spots. Any temporary or
permanent changes to the following plan must be coordinated with the Airfield Manager in
advance to ensure pavements are stressed for type aircraft and to prevent FOD.

       normally be used. Due to pavement conditions, the Airfield Manager must evaluate each
       request on a case-by-case basis and consult with the pavements engineer as necessary.
   2.7.2. Explosive Cargo Storage or Parking Areas.
       2.7.2.1. Designated hazardous cargo storage and parking areas are on Taxiway Bravo
       South (in between Runway 05R/23L and Taxiway Kilo), Taxiway Bravo Center (in
       between both runways, contingency only), and Taxiway Delta North (in between Runway
       05L/23R and Taxiway Lima, helicopter only). Additional hazardous cargo/explosives
       parking limits are depicted on the Explosives Loaded Aircraft Parking Plan (Tab D-8) for
       Kadena AB.
       2.7.2.2. Parking or storage of explosives in other than authorized areas, or in greater than
       the specified quantities, must be approved by 18th Wing Weapons Safety (18 WG/SEW),
       parking spot owner, and Airfield Manager.
       2.7.2.3. Coordination with the Airfield Manager and 18 WG/SE is required before
       utilizing Taxiway Bravo or Delta as an Explosive Cargo Parking Area. Certain control
       measures must be implemented when aircraft are parked in these areas in order to
       minimize risk to other airfield users. These measures include limiting the use of certain
       portions of the airfield, sending a NOTAM, or restricting instrument procedures.
       2.7.2.4. Overflow Parking: Taxiway Bravo South is designated as overflow parking for
       wide body aircraft IAW permanent waivers #107 and #108, approved via Pacific Air
       Forces Vice Commander (PACAF/CV) memorandum to 18 WG/CC dated 14 Aug 07.
       Certain control measures must be implemented when aircraft are parked in the overflow
       parking area. Users must consult with AMOPS prior to utilizing the area for parking.
   2.7.3. F-16 Hydrazine Emergency Parking Areas. Aircraft with possible hydrazine leaks or
   EPU activation will be directed to exit the runway at Taxiway Bravo or Echo and stop
   between the runways. The alternate parking locations are Taxiways Alpha or Foxtrot
   between the runways. Refer to paragraph 2.16.4.3 for normal hydrazine maintenance
   procedures/locations.
   2.7.4. PL2 Asset Parking. The designated PL2 parking spots are November 10-15. The
   designated PL2 overflow parking spots are Mike (M) 1-3. Parking will start on M-3, then M-
   2, and as last resort M-1. M-1 is an alternate fuel cell maintenance location and must remain
   available to the maximum extent practical.
   2.7.5. Operation Spots Parking Coordination Procedures. When ops row needs to be used
   for parking aircraft with wingspans of 99 feet or greater, maintenance personnel must remove
   all equipment and vehicles along the concourse walkway. Maintenance personnel will
   position a wing walker (with wands for night operations) along the concourse during taxi in
   and out. The use of ops row must be coordinated with AMOPS prior to aircraft parking.
2.8. ATC Facilities. Kadena Tower is open 24 hours per day. Kadena GCA is open 24 hours
per day, however, radar final control services are normally only available from 0800L – 2200L,
and at other times as required to support DoD flying missions. The Kadena Arrival facility is
normally open daily from 0600L – 2200L, and at other times as required to support DoD flying
missions.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                    19


   2.8.1. Tower. The Kadena Tower designated airspace is that airspace extending upward
   from the surface to but not including 3,000 feet AGL (3,143 feet MSL) within a 5nm radius
   of the Kadena AB Airport Reference Point (ARP: N 26°21.337' E 127°46.058'), excluding
   the area 3 miles south of runway 5R/23L that is of the MCAS Futenma Class D airspace
   (Class D Surface Area) from the surface up to but not including 2000 feet AGL (2250 feet
   MSL) (See Figure A2.7).
   2.8.2. Ground Control Approach (GCA). Note: Japanese airspace regulations require that
   this facility be classified as Kadena GCA. However, per USAF definitions this facility meets
   the criteria of a Radar Final Control (RFC). The remainder of this instruction will refer to
   this facility as a GCA.
   2.8.3. Kadena Arrival. The ATC function that provides arrival control and successive
   radar/instrument pattern control for U.S. airfields in Okinawa. It is located at the Naha
   Approach Control Facility at Naha Airport. It is also responsible for providing the services
   required for the conduct of operations at landing zones, drop zones, or both, in U.S. facilities
   or areas and aircraft operations aboard ships in and around the island of Okinawa.

   and GCA services. The DASR normally is not required to be turn off during high winds
   because of the protective radome over the antenna.
   2.10.4. Precision Approach Radar (PAR). The PAR is located between the runways and
   provides precision radar approach to all runways. Kadena has dual PAR capability.
   Commander, U.S. Marine Forces Pacific (COMMARFORPAC) is responsible for operations
   and maintenance of the PAR. COMMARFORPAC staffs the PAR with U.S. Marine Corps
   (USMC) personnel. U.S. Air Force (USAF) aircrews may request PAR approaches or a
   monitored ILS approach during an emergency, aircraft equipment malfunction event,
   precision approach or instrument meteorological conditions. During normal operating hours
   USAF may operate the PAR for training on a workload-permitting basis.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                       21


     2.10.4.1. Operating Hours. PAR hours of service are limited to Mon-Fri 0800L-2200L,
     excluding holidays. PAR approaches outside of normal operating hours may be
     requested in advance through the 18 OG/CC scheduling meeting and will be provided as
     qualified staffing permits.
     2.10.4.2. Due to unit location and the staggered runways, the PAR touchdown points are
     not uniform. See the FLIP Radar Instrument Approach Minimums section for more
     detailed information.
     2.10.4.3. 18th Wing flying squadrons will support controller requests to fly PAR
     approaches to the maximum extent possible to maintain controller proficiency. 18
     OSS/OSA will brief any additional requirements at 18 OG/CC scheduling meeting, so
     flying squadrons may plan accordingly.
  2.10.5. Auxiliary Power Requirements.
     2.10.5.1. The primary back-up power system for the Tower and GCA is the air
     commercial power plant, which has an auto-start capability. The back-up systems for the
     air commercial power plant are Tower and GCA individual facility generators (building
     3418 and 3413), which also have auto-start capability on a 5 second delay behind the air
     commercial power plant. In the event both air commercial power plant and the individual
     facility generators fail to auto-start, controllers, if trained, are authorized to manually start
     the units. Under such circumstances, the watch supervisor or senior controller shall:
     2.10.5.1.1. Follow the appropriate facility checklist.
     2.10.5.2. Notify 18 CS/CFP, 18 CES Service Call, and the weather observer in the
     control tower that the generator will be started.
     2.10.5.2.1. Ensure the generators are started. If the generator operates continuously
     (more than one hour), the watch supervisor or senior controller will ensure that the
     appropriate generator documentation is annotated on the AF Form 487.
     2.10.5.2.2. Under normal conditions following a commercial power outage, air
     commercial power will auto-start with a 5 second delay and feed 100% of the load to
     both the Tower and GCA. In the event air commercial power fails to auto-start, individual
     facility generators in buildings 3418 and 3413 assume the load within 10 to 15 seconds.
     The facility generator in the GCA feeds only the technical load in the IFR room (scopes
     and ETVS); the Tower facility generator feeds the elevator and technical load. Once air
     commercial power is online the building generators’ transfer system times out and
     switches the load to the air commercial power plant. The building generators will then
     automatically shut down. During all transfer processes the GCA UPS (Uninterrupted
     power supply) will assume load on initial outage and act as a filter to incoming generator
     power. When commercial power is restored, air commercial power plant generator will
     automatically begin re-transfer and shutdown operations. Once the transfer systems has
     timed out the generator will automatically shutdown. The air commercial power plant is
     normally manned. However, during severe weather/tropical cyclone condition of
     readiness (TCCOR) conditions, power plant production personnel are on standby at the
     18 CEG/UCC, building 1461, 24 hours a day.
     2.10.5.3. 18 CES/CEO shall ensure:
22                                                      KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


        2.10.5.3.1. Power production personnel complete required preventative maintenance
        inspections (PMIs) to achieve a 100% reliability rate. PMIs include checking fluid
        level and if power transfer control panel are properly set.
        2.10.5.3.2. During periods of extended operations on auxiliary power, if manning and
        mission priorities provide for, check and notify facility managers of generator fuel
        status. However, facility managers must be proactive and ensure their generator(s) are
        checked every 2 hours.
        2.10.5.3.3. The auto-start or auto-transfer system is tested in accordance with AFI
        13-204v3, Airfield Operations Programs and Procedures, AFI 32-1063 Electric Power
        Systems. Use procedures that duplicate conditions during a nonscheduled power
        outage (e.g., ―kill‖ commercial power to auto transfer panel).
        2.10.5.3.4. Power production personnel coordinate with 18 CS/CFP and the GCA
        prior to testing or transferring power at an Air Field System (AFS) and/or with the
        affected ATC facility prior to transferring power at transmitter or receiver site.
        2.10.5.3.5. Qualified personnel will respond to emergency ATCALS back-up
        generator failure within 20 minutes during normal duty hours (0730L-1630L). After
        hours (1630L-0730L, weekends, and holidays), response time will be as soon as
        possible but not later than 1 hour.
        2.10.5.3.6. Generator certification training is provided to 18 OSS/OSA and 18
        CS/SCOA as needed (no less than annually).
     2.10.5.4. 18 CS/SCO shall ensure:
        2.10.5.4.1. On-site maintenance technicians are available for any generator test
        affecting an ATCALS component.
        2.10.5.4.2. Communications Focal Point is the central coordination point between
        ATC and civil engineers and in-house maintenance work centers.
        2.10.5.4.3. 18 CS/SCOA maintenance personnel are trained by 18 CES/CEO as
        needed (no less than annually) and can provide documentation of training.
        2.10.5.4.4. Under extended auxiliary power operations (continuous generator
        operations longer than one hour), facility managers, via their certified generator
        personnel, will visually check the generator(s) for signs of concern (e.g., fuel, coolant
        or oil leaks), document the AF Form 487 of the appropriate reading/data per their
        training, and check and schedule fuel deliveries through base fuels.
     2.10.5.5. 18 OSS/OSA shall:
        2.10.5.5.1. Ensure the GCA/Tower watch supervisor notifies other ATC agencies
        prior to ATCALS transferring to back-up power. This will allow 18 CE personnel to
        check the building generators’ auto-start and load assumption feature without
        impacting flying operations.
        2.10.5.5.2. Ensure personnel are trained by 18 CES/CEO as needed (no less than
        annually) and can provide documentation of training.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                   23


          2.10.5.5.3. Under extended auxiliary power operations (continuous generator
          operations longer than one hour), facility mangers, via their certified generator
          personnel, will visually check the generator(s) for sign of concern (e.g., fuel, coolant
          or oil leaks), document the AF Form 487 of the appropriate reading/data per their
          training, and check and schedule fuel deliveries through base fuels.
2.11. Transient Alert (TA) Services. Kadena Transient Alert operates continuously 24 hours a
day. See FLIP Enroute Supplement for TA Services Available to support transient aircraft.
2.12. Automated Terminal Information System (ATIS) Procedures. The ATIS will be
operated IAW FAAO 7110.65 and will be in the Meteorological Aviation Report (METAR)

  2.15.5. Outdoor Wash Rack (Hardstand 1019). The outdoor wash rack (Hardstand 1019) is
  declared a ―no taxi zone‖ for aircraft. The outdoor wash rack is located between Taxiways
  Lima and Mike (between parking spot L10 and L-11 Bird Bath) and is off limits for aircraft
  taxiing purposes. Due to limited clearance and the possibility of foreign object ingestion into
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                     27


   operating aircraft engines when crossing metal grates used to drain effluent from the wash
   area, all aircraft must be towed by a vehicle when being placed on the wash rack. Once
   aircraft arrive at the facility, towing crews must exercise extreme caution when parking
   aircraft. Complete towing crews must be used when placing aircraft on the wash rack.
   2.15.6. L-11 Bird Bath. The L-11 Bird Bath is a taxi-through wash rack, located directly on
   spot L-11. There are no wind restrictions. Aircraft may enter the wash rack from taxiway
   Lima or Mike. The L-11 Bird Bath is activated and reset by treadles (pressure switches).
   Aircraft activate the L-11 Bird Bath by crossing the first treadle and initiate reset by crossing
   the second treadle. In the event one treadle is crossed and the second is not, the system is not
   reset, but will auto-reset in five to seven minutes. Vehicle movement on the treadles is
   prohibited (See Figure A2.1).
   2.15.7. Fighter Wash Rack. The Fighter Wash Rack is a taxi through wash rack located
   south of Taxiway Juliet across from the Transient Ramp. It has no wind restrictions. A
   NOTAM will be issued when the Fighter Wash Rack facility is unavailable. Aircraft Taxi
   flow is always Kilo, Delta, Juliet, Fighter Wash Rack, Juliet and Echo. Aircraft must stay on
   the painted taxi line to ensure tail and wing tip clearance, and must use extreme caution
   during hours of darkness and reduced visibility for an unlit structure. Subsequent aircraft
   must wait for water to stop before triggering the wash rack (See Figure A2.1).
   2.15.8. Taxiway Bravo Coordination Procedures. Maintainers will coordinate use of
   Taxiway Bravo South for aircraft parking with the Airfield Manager NLT two hours prior to
   use.

          WG/CP.
      2.21.1.3. Engine Run During Quiet Hours.
          2.21.1.3.1. Quiet hours for maintenance engine runs are 2200L to 0600L.
          2.21.1.3.2. Unless hush house or engine test cell facilities are used, or when
          operational capability or readiness would be impaired as determined by the CFAO, 18
          MXG, and 733 AMS Commanders in Tables 2.8 thru 2.11, maintenance engine runs
          above idle power are only authorized between the hours of 0800L and 1800L daily.
          Additionally, limit engine testing to instances using noise suppressors, or when
          operational capability or readiness would be impaired as determined by the CFAO, 18
          MXG, and 733 AMS Commanders between the hours of 1800L and 0800L daily.
          2.21.1.3.3. Maintenance engine runs in hush houses and engine test cells are
          unlimited. These areas will be used for engine runs to the maximum extent possible.
      2.21.1.3.4. Waivers.
              2.21.1.3.4.1. Maintenance engine runs above idle power not covered by Tables
              2.8-2.11 and outside the hours of 0600L thru 1800L Mon-Sat and 1200L-1800L
              on Sunday, days of special significance, and US Holidays require an approved
              waiver. Before requesting a waiver, the supporting MOCC should review all
              NOTAMs.
              2.21.1.3.4.2. Except as specified below, 18 OG/CC approves requests for waivers
              to the quiet hour restrictions for maintenance engine test runs.
                  2.21.1.3.4.2.1. The commander of 733 AMS (733 AMS/CC) may approve

                  aircraft for mission essential write-ups.
   2.21.2. Engine Run Locations. Agencies performing run-ups are responsible for ensuring
   the area affected by the engine runs is clear and will control vehicle traffic passing to the rear
   of the aircraft. Agencies will also ensure any resulting FOD is removed after the run is
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                               33


  completed. Monitoring of Ground Control frequency during all maintenance aircraft engine
  starts and run-ups is mandatory. All run-ups shall be coordinated with AMOPS.
     2.21.2.1. Run-ups are prohibited on Hardstand 102, Spots 1 through 5 on the operational
     apron (Ops Row), and Service Apron 2, Spot Alpha. Idle runs are not considered run-
     ups.
     2.21.2.2. All aircraft run-ups using over 80 percent power on Service Apron 1 and
     Hardstands 111, 113, 115, 117,119, 121, 123, and 125 require radio contact with Tower
     on frequency 275.8/118.5. Prior coordination must be accomplished through the
     appropriate job control. When exceeding ground idle power setting on these locations,
     the outside monitor will exercise extreme caution regarding traffic or equipment behind
     the aircraft. When turbulence is a hazard to arriving/departing aircraft, the Tower watch
     supervisor will terminate the engine run-up or detour arriving/departing aircraft in a
     manner that keeps the aircraft from behind the run-up area.
     2.21.2.3. Full engine run-ups are permitted on hardstands equipped with blast deflectors
     or revetments. Warm-Up pad 1 is designated as a full run-up location for all aircraft.
     2.21.2.4. Engine run-ups for wide-body aircraft, to include C-5, B-747, L-101, KC-10,
     C-17 and similar airframes, will be conducted on Service Apron 1, Taxiway Bravo South
     and Taxiway Bravo North. Because of engine run-up locations and type aircraft,
     restrictions to include closure of taxiway and runways may be required. All run-ups shall
     be coordinated with AMOPS. Additionally, units will ensure safety spotters are
     positioned to keep vehicles and personnel from entering the jet exhaust area. Note: C-17
     engine runs above idle may be conducted on Service Apron 2 following coordination
     with Airfield Management and 18 OG/CC approval.
         2.21.2.4.1. Engine run-ups on Service Apron 1 (Spots 1A, 1B, 1C) will point nose of
         aircraft toward Taxiway Kilo. Runway 05R/23L will be closed and requires FOD
         sweep by AMOPS prior to resuming operations.
         2.21.2.4.2. Engine run-ups on Taxiway Bravo South will position nose on a 60
         heading facing Taxiway Kilo. Runway 05R/23L and Taxiway Bravo Center will be
         closed and require FOD sweeps by AMOPS prior to resuming operations.
         Additionally, aircraft may be oriented with nose toward Runway 05R/23L and
         aligned 45 degrees off-center from taxi line. When run-ups are conducted in this
         orientation the maximum power setting will be two engines to 90 percent power and
         two engines at idle power. If a higher power setting is required, the Production
         Superintendent will request permission from Maintenance Ops officer and/or
         Maintenance Superintendent. In this case, the Taxiway Kilo and Taxiway Bravo
         intersection will be closed. Safety spotters will be positioned to keep vehicles and
         personnel from entering the jet exhaust area.
         2.21.2.4.3. Engine run-ups on Taxiway Bravo North will orient aircraft nose on a 050
         heading, parallel with Runway 05L. Runway 05L/23R and Taxiway Lima—between
         Taxiway Bravo North and Taxiway Alpha North—will be closed due to potential
         FOD from the infield behind the jet exhaust area and jet blast effect on Taxiway Lima
         and Runway 05L approach end. AMOPS will conduct a FOD sweep prior to
         resuming operations.

       2.21.2.5. Navy P-3 High Power Run Areas. P-3 engine maintenance runs will use
       Warm-Up Pad 1 as the primary location. It provides the least hazard to passing vehicles
       and pedestrians. Aircrews should request this area from the tower unless conditions
       preclude such actions.
       2.21.2.6. 353 SOG C-130s engine runs will be conducted primarily on Taxiway Lima;
       their maintainers are not taxi qualified. Warm-Up Pad 1 is the alternate engine run
       location.

2.22. Noise Abatement Procedures.
   2.22.1. Purpose. Paragraph 2.22 details aircraft flight and ground noise minimization
   procedures at Kadena AB.
       2.22.1.1. The Governments of the United States and Japan have acknowledged the
       competing requirements of maintaining the safety of flight, accomplishing the mission,
       and abating noise when operating and maintaining aircraft. To alleviate concerns about
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                     37


     aircraft noise without jeopardizing US Forces Japan missions, the Governments agreed to
     certain procedures to minimize noise resulting from flight and maintenance operations of
     aircraft. In particular, these procedures strive to minimize aircraft-related noise during
     evening and nighttime hours.
     2.22.1.2. The following procedures, when combined with airfield traffic pattern policies,
     exceed the requirements of the agreement. These procedures have been successful in
     reducing objections to noise generated on the Kadena airfield.
     2.22.1.3. All assigned and transient flying and maintenance personnel must abide by
     these requirements outlined below and in Table 2.12. Local squadrons, detachments, or
     offices will brief transient units on these procedures before the transient unit may operate
     into and out of Kadena AB.
     2.22.1.4. Decisions regarding mission accomplishment inconsistent with the procedures
     and policies below may be made at a level no lower than 18 OG/CC. This decision
     making level helps ensure due and close attention to issues related to aircraft noise and
     the application of appropriate aircraft noise countermeasures.
     2.22.1.5. Nothing in the agreement of the Governments limits actions required for safety
     of flight. Nothing in the agreement of the Government limits actions taken for
     operational necessity.
  2.22.2. Basic noise abatement limitations for flight operations are contained in Table 2.12.
  2.22.3. Additional Flight Operation Rules. These rules apply to flight operations whether
  during or outside of quiet hours.
     2.22.3.1. After sunset, circling approaches will be kept to a minimum required for check
     ride completion or to fulfill semi-annual continuation training requirements.
     2.22.3.2. High-Power setting carrier-type tactical approaches are not authorized.
     2.22.3.3. Field carrier landing practice approaches are not authorized.
     2.22.3.4. Arriving multiengine aircraft will minimize reverse thrust to the maximum
     extent possible.
     2.22.3.5. Use of afterburners is limited to that required for safety of flight and
     operational necessity. If afterburners are used during takeoff, use will be terminated as
     soon as practical.
     2.22.3.6. Supersonic flight is prohibited over and in the vicinity of the main island of
     Okinawa for the purpose of training.
     2.22.3.7. Acrobatic flight for training within five statute miles of Kadena AB is
     prohibited except for programmed demonstrations of acrobatic flight.
  2.22.4. Kadena-Cho Operations. In order to reduce aircraft noise upon Kadena-Cho from
  Service Aprons 4 and 5, P-3 aircraft will taxi to and from parking using two engines within
  aircraft operating limitations. In addition, P-3s will normally conduct ground operations
  using ground power and air conditioning carts.
  2.22.5. Quiet Hour NOTAMs. Restrictions on aircraft noise generating activities on US
  holidays, days of special significance, and other short-duration quiet hours will be directed

   will notify AMOPS of directed restrictions. AMOPS will publish NOTAMs regarding
   approved restrictions.

NOTE: Any deviation from restrictions listed in this table must be approved by the 18 OG/CC
through the scheduling meeting NLT 10 working days prior to the requested period. Missions
printed on 18 WG weekly schedule, 353 SOG weekly schedule, and P-3 48-hour projection
message have been coordinated and approved by 18 OG/CC. These aircraft do not require
additional approval. If short-notice coordination is necessary, coordinate 18 OG/CC
approval/disapproval through 18 WG/CP (DSN 634-1800) NLT 2 hours prior to takeoff. In turn,
18 WG/CP will notify AMOPS, Tower, and Naha Approach Control of approval/disapproval.
2.23. Protection of Precision Approach Critical Areas. There are two critical areas
associated with precision approaches at Kadena AB, which must be protected. The localizer and
glide slope critical areas must be protected because of possible interference to the Instrument
 40                                                        KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


Landing System (ILS) signal (See Figure A2.3).          The instrument hold lines provide this
protection.
   2.23.1. ILS.
       2.23.1.1. Glideslope Critical Areas. When the ceiling is below 800 feet or the visibility
       is less than 2 miles, Tower shall not permit any type of vehicle or aircraft to proceed
       beyond the instrument hold line when an aircraft is conducting an ILS approach and is
       inside the final approach fix (See Figure A2.3).
       2.23.1.2. Localizer Critical Areas. When the ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or the
       visibility is less than 2 miles, Tower shall not permit vehicles or aircraft to transit the
       localizer critical area when an aircraft is conducting an ILS approach and is inside the
       final approach fix. EXCEPTION: A preceding aircraft, approaching the same runway or
       another runway, may pass through the area while landing, departing, or exiting the
       runway; Tower shall not allow aircraft to stop within the critical area. (See Figure A2.3).
       2.23.1.3. Ground Control will restrict any vehicles from using centerline road between
       Taxiways Alpha and Bravo (Runway 05 operations), or Taxiways Echo and Foxtrot
       (Runway 23 operations) when the ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or visibility is less than
       2 miles and an aircraft executing an ILS is at or inside the final approach fix.
   2.23.2. Instrument Hold Lines. Critical areas are marked by instrument hold lines consisting
   of two parallel lines with vertical stripes and the letters ―INST.‖ Instrument hold lines are
   located on Taxiways Alpha, Bravo, and Foxtrot on the north and south sides of Runways
   05L/23R and 05R/23L and on the north and south sides of Runway 05L/23R on Taxiway
   Echo.
2.24. Restricted/Classified Areas on the Airfield.
   2.24.1. Controlled Areas.
       2.24.1.1. The airfield is a controlled area as defined in Kadena Air Base Instruction
       (KABI) 31-101, The Kadena Air Base Installation Security Instruction and AFI 31-101,
       Integrated Defense. Entry to the airfield is generally permitted for official business only.
       All persons on the airfield must possess identifying credentials and produce them on
       demand.
       2.24.1.2. Custodians of non-priority aircraft parking areas, maintenance areas, and
       commanders whose personnel perform duties within these areas (whether or not their
       units exercise administrative or functional control over these areas), to include the
       general flight line area (taxiways and runways), will ensure all personnel challenge any
       unauthorized individuals operating within the area. Any person acting suspiciously or
       whose presence within these areas is questionable must be challenged and positively
       identified. Positive identification of an individual is not in itself enough authority to be
       in an area; presence must be for official duties only. The (BDOC) Base Defense
       Operation Center must be notified any time individuals who cannot be immediately
       identified are detected. For routine calls, dial 634-2475/2476. For emergencies dial the
       Helping Hand Hotline at 634-4444.
       2.24.1.3. Contractors will possess either 5 AF Form 98EJ, Standard Pass (Storage
       Safeguard Form) or 5 AF Form 98a EJ, Temporary Pass (Storage Safeguard Form) over
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                   41


     stamped ―CONTRACTOR.‖ Listings of contractors performing duty on the airfield will
     be provided to (BDOC) Base Defense Operation Center, maintenance operations control
     centers, and Airfield Management for verification purposes. All contractors operating a
     POV on the airfield must have proper escort for access to restricted areas and must
     comply with requirements in KABI 13-13, Airfield Driving.
  2.24.2. Restricted Areas.
     2.24.2.1. KABI 31-101 outlines restricted area numbers, physical locations, descriptions
     of the areas, priority, and organizations having operational control of each designated
     restricted area.
     2.24.2.2. All personnel within restricted areas must be vigilant for unauthorized intruders
     or any suspicious acts. Challenge any person without a badge or anyone wearing a badge
     without the appropriate restricted area number. To initiate implementation of a Security
     Incidents, notify security forces immediately after the individual is in the final challenge
     position.
         2.24.2.2.1. Personnel in a restricted area who observe a security violation will report
         the incident to BDOC at 634-4444.
         2.24.2.2.2. Crossing the restricted area boundary, red rope, or painted red line at
         locations other than designated entry points is unauthorized. This act violates
         security procedures and will initiate a Security Incidents incident. Entry control
         points are depicted by white signs with the large red letters ―ECP‖ and small red
         numbers identifying the ECP number.
         2.24.2.2.3. Escort and control procedures are contained in KABI 31-101.
  2.24.3. Free Zone.
     2.24.3.1. Free zones (zones containing no protection level resources) are areas
     established within restricted areas when construction projects and similar activities make
     it inappropriate or impractical to apply normal circulation controls.
     2.24.3.2. Requests for the establishment of a ―Free Zone‖ will be submitted to the
     Integrated Defense Council IAW KABI 31-101..
  2.24.4. Aircraft Anti-Hijacking.
     2.24.4.1. All Kadena AB flight line personnel will be alert to unauthorized movement of
     any aircraft under operational control or being serviced by units assigned to Kadena AB.
     All personnel must be alert to the possibility of aircraft theft. Strange behavior of persons
     in aircraft parking areas will be reported to supervisory personnel or security forces
     immediately. Suspicious persons will be challenged and detained pending arrival of
     proper authority. This also applies to persons obviously or apparently under the influence
     of alcohol or drugs. MOCC will provide advance notification of aircraft maintenance
     engine run-up or taxi operations to the Tower and Base Defense Operation Center
     (BDOC). Unusual and/or unannounced maintenance-related engine starts or aircraft
     movements, to include those performed without displaying exterior aircraft lights or
     without the presence of an aircraft marshaller or run-up crew, will be reported
     immediately to 18 WG/CP. If more immediate action appears warranted, a ―Security
     Incidents‖ will be reported to BDOC via the HELPING HAND Hotline at 634-4444.

     Security will be provided to all aircraft on Kadena AB to prevent access to unqualified or
     unauthorized persons. Special security will be provided to designated aircraft
     transporting Code 4 or higher ranking personnel.
     2.24.4.2. Specific anti-hijacking instructions are contained in Joint Order FAAO 7610.4,
     Special Operations (FOUO), which supersedes all previous hijack/suspicious activities-
     related guidance, and KABI 31-101. ATC should be cognizant that aircrews/ground
     crews may use covert signals IAW AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy
     (Hijacking) (FOUO).
     2.24.4.3. Due to several control tower visual blind spots, all personnel working in the
     UFR and north of the airfield must maintain a higher state of alertness.

       information on aircraft identification, position, altitude and pilot's intentions. Naha
       Approach will provide control instructions for the areas overlapping the Naha, Kadena,
       and Futenma Class D Airspaces.
       3.1.3.2. Class D Airspace (Class D Surface Area) (AIP: Control Zone): That airspace
       extending upward from the surface to but not including 3,000 feet AGL (3,143 feet MSL)
       within a 5nm radius of the Kadena AB Airport Reference Point (ARP: N 26°21.337' E
       127°46.058'), excluding the area 3 miles south of runway 5R/23L that is of the MCAS
       Futenma Class D airspace (Class D Surface Area) from the surface up to but not
       including 2000 feet AGL (2250 feet MSL) (See Figure A2.7).
       3.1.3.3. Class E Airspace. That airspace extending upward from 700/1,000/2,000 feet
       AGL up to and including 20,000 feet within 50 nm of the Kadena VORTAC, excluding
       the Naha PCA and Class D airspace.
       3.1.3.4. Class G Airspace. That airspace extending upward from the surface up to but
       not including 700/1,000/2,000 feet AGL, with the exclusion of Class D and Naha PCA.
       Class G airspace is uncontrolled airspace.
   3.1.4. Restricted Areas (See Figure A2.11).
       3.1.4.1. Restricted Area Altitudes (See Table 3.1).

      ENR 5.1 and DoD FLIP 44 AP/3A (Special Use Airspace).
      3.1.5.3. Air-to Air Warning Areas. The air-to-air warning areas include W172, W173,
      W179, and W185. Mobile 9 and Shovel are Altitude Reservation (ALTRV)s normally
      extending from 5,500 feet AGL to FL 400 (pilots shall check the daily schedule for exact
      ALTRV altitudes and times). Reference the Shogun In-flight Guide, Volume 1, for area
      depiction and frequencies.
3.2. VFR Local Training Areas.
   3.2.1. Departure to off-island airspace or out of the Naha PCA airspace will be via an
   established route, clearance or standard radar departure.
   3.2.2. ATC radar flight following is mandatory during the departure phase. Radar flight
   following after visual meteorological conditions (VMC) on top will be requested with either
   Naha Approach Control or ground control intercept (GCI) facility.
   3.2.3. Tactical training is conducted in the various warning areas. Prior permission must be
   obtained from the controlling agency before entering the warning areas via scheduling the
   airspace through 18 Operations Support Squadron (18 OSS) Wing Scheduling.
   3.2.4. Southeast Training Area (SETA). The SETA dimensions, procedures, and authorized
   users are defined in the Okinawa ATC Agreement Tab A and Tab E
   3.2.5. Chaff:
      3.2.5.1. General. Chaff may only be used within the appropriate warning areas and
      ALTRVs as per AFI 13-212 Kadena AB Sup, A3.2.2.
      3.2.5.2. Aircrew Procedures. Before flight, aircrews must check winds aloft. Aircrews
      must assess in-flight winds to determine if chaff will drift over land or into ATC airways.
      Pay particular attention to high winds aloft blowing toward Okinawa from W-179. Chaff

     employment in W-179 is not authorized when winds aloft are reported or forecasted to be
     greater than 50 knots, unless it is RR-188 chaff.
     3.2.5.3. ATC will immediately notify 18 WG/CP of chaff use that significantly impacts
     flying operations.
     3.2.5.4. Deployed units causing the problem will be prohibited from using chaff for the
     remainder of their deployment. Local units will suspend chaff operations until approved
     by 18 OG/CC.

                                      VFR PROCEDURES

4.1. VFR Weather Minimums. The Kadena Class D Surface Area is considered VFR when
the ceiling is at or above 1,000' and the visibility is 3 miles or greater. Tower controllers will not
allow VFR operations when the weather deteriorates below VFR conditions, or when controllers
are unable to provide visual separation between aircraft in the VFR pattern, regardless of the
official weather observation.
4.2. VFR Traffic Patterns.
   4.2.1. VFR Traffic Patterns. Multiple approaches are authorized between 0600-2200L daily,
   not to include Sundays and holidays, except as noted in Table 2.12. The overhead pattern is
   open sunrise to end of civil twilight. This restriction applies to the 1,800’ pattern and not the
   conventional rectangular pattern (1,300’) or the helicopter and Aero Club pattern (800’).
   Aircraft will avoid over-flying highly populated off-base areas to the maximum extent
   possible. Pilots must ensure strict adherence to the VFR traffic pattern due to close
   proximity to Naha International and Futenma MCAS traffic patterns, and also to comply with
   noise abatement procedures in paragraph 2.22. No other non-standard patterns will be flown
   without prior 18 OG/CC approval (See Figures A2.14 thru A2.16.).
       4.2.1.1. Exceptions.
           4.2.1.1.1. KC-135s, E-3s and MC-130s are permitted to fly night VFR overhead
           patterns (between civil twilight and 2200L) to satisfy initial or continuation training
           requirements.
           4.2.1.1.2. When unit night flying is annotated on 18 WG/CP or approved flying
           schedules, both the conventional rectangular patterns and instrument approaches that
           culminate in a circling approach are authorized after sunset in order to satisfy
           continuation training and/or check ride requirements.
           4.2.1.1.3. Training flights on Sundays and holidays require 18 OG/CC approval and
           will not normally be authorized. Circling approaches after sunset will be kept to an
           absolute minimum required for check ride completion or to fulfill semi-annual
           continuation training requirements. Note: Unit commanders will be diligent to
           comply with quiet hours restrictions by ensuring night training flights are limited to
           the minimum required to fulfill assigned US Forces Japan missions and maintain
           aircrew proficiency, and by making every effort to complete night flying operations
           as early as possible. 18 OG/CC is the waiver authority for any exceptions to these
           restrictions
           4.2.1.1.4. Any heavy aircraft that passes 3 DME on runway 05L/05R downwind,
           must automatically climb to 2000’ MSL to deconflict with Naha arrivals/departures.
       4.2.1.2. VFR Traffic Pattern Altitudes and Direction of Turns:
           4.2.1.2.1. High Initial and High Tactical Initial (fighter aircraft only) – Up to 6,000
           feet MSL. Patterns shall be flown to the south.
48                                                        KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


         4.2.1.2.2. C-130 High Initial (C-130 aircraft only) – Up to 4,500 feet MSL. Patterns
         shall be flown to the north unless directed by ATC.
         4.2.1.2.3. Tactical Initial (fighter aircraft only) – 1,800 feet MSL. Patterns shall be
         flown to the south.
         4.2.1.2.4. Initial (Overhead) – 1,800 feet MSL. Fighter patterns shall be flown to the
         south and heavy patterns shall be flown to the north. Propeller aircraft may fly in
         either pattern.
         4.2.1.2.5. Conventional Rectangular – 1,300 feet MSL. Heavy aircraft shall fly north
         patterns. Propeller driven aircraft may fly north or south patterns. South patterns are
         preferred for propeller driven aircraft.
         4.2.1.2.6. Helicopter and Aero Club – 800 feet MSL. Patterns may be flown south or
         north. South patterns are preferred.
     4.2.1.3. KC-135s / E-3s flying VFR patterns to Runway 05L/23R will avoid populated
     area over flight as much as possible.
     4.2.1.4. Flight below local traffic pattern altitudes should be avoided except when the
     mission requires.
     4.2.1.5. Aircraft flying closed traffic patterns will delay pull-up to downwind leg until
     passing the runway end. On Runway 23, fly closed traffic pattern by executing closed
     traffic turn at departure end over water to avoid noise sensitive areas. Midfield and
     present position closed patterns are authorized if approved by tower.
     4.2.1.6. Closed traffic patterns will be flown in a clean configuration (gear and flaps up)
     within operational constraints until aircraft are established on downwind leg. Aircraft
     experiencing an emergency or having a procedural requirement to do so may fly a gear
     down pattern. Aircrews will advise tower of gear down patterns.
     4.2.1.7. When operations are in progress above 500 feet AGL at the 18 MUNS Explosive
     Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Range (2 nm north of approach end Runway 23R), Yomitan
     Re-Entry, Yomitan Straight-In, and 1,300 feet MSL rectangular patterns north of the
     runways shall be suspended. Helicopters may use the 800 feet MSL pattern provided
     they are advised of the activity and will remain within 1 nm of Runway 05L/23R.
  4.2.2. 360º Overhead Patterns (Initial/Tactical Initial and High Initial/High Tactical Initial)
  (See Figures A2.14 and A2.15).
     4.2.2.1. Weather Requirements. The minimum reported ceiling required for the Initial
     and Tactical Initial patterns is at least 2300’. The minimum reported ceiling required for
     the High Initial and High Tactical Initial patterns is at least 2300’ and consideration to the
     sky conditions permitting VMC descent while maneuvering from the High Initial and
     High Tactical Initial pattern entry to threshold. The 360º overhead patterns may be
     closed, as determined by the Tower watch supervisor.
     4.2.2.2. Pattern Requirements. Overhead patterns shall not be flown below 1,800 feet
     MSL. Fighter patterns will be flown to the south and heavy patterns will be flown to the
     north. When landing on Runway 05L/R, extend inside downwind until ―feet wet.‖
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                  49


     Aircraft shall avoid angling final, fly at least a one-mile final, and be aligned with the
     runway centerline prior to becoming ―feet dry.‖
     4.2.2.3. Initial. Unless otherwise directed by Tower, initial will be flown over Runway
     05R or 23L. Aircraft inbound to initial shall maintain 2,500 feet, unless a lower altitude
     is approved by ATC. Aircraft shall descend to 1,800 feet MSL (initial altitude) at 5 DME
     or once established on initial and inside the Kadena Class D Surface Area. If pilots are
     instructed to report initial, report initial between 3 and 5 DME, however range is not
     required in the radio call (e.g., ―Shogun 1, Initial.‖).
     4.2.2.4. Tactical Initial. Aircraft inbound to tactical initial shall maintain 2,500 feet
     unless a lower altitude is approved by ATC. Aircraft shall descend to 1,800 feet MSL
     (initial altitude) at 5 DME or once established on initial and inside the Kadena Class D
     Surface Area. The lead aircraft flies initial to the inside runway (05R/23L) at 350 KIAS.
     Wingmen fly tactical formation (3,000’ lateral from lead aircraft not to exceed the
     confines of Kadena AB). Aircraft three and four fly 1-mile trail. The lead aircraft
     pitches out normally, two pitches simultaneously with lead, pauses at 90º (belly check)
     and continues to normal spacing on downwind. Three delays break to roll out in trail
     with two. The second element follows the same procedures as the lead element.
     4.2.2.5. High Initial: Aircraft inbound to High Initial shall fly to the inside runway
     (05R/23L and maintain the altitude requested with and approved by ATC up to 6,000 feet
     MSL. Aircraft execute a descending break to arrive on downwind at 1,800 feet MSL.
     4.2.2.6. High Tactical Initial: Aircraft inbound to High Tactical Initial shall maintain the
     altitude requested with and approved by ATC up to 6,000 feet MSL. The lead aircraft
     flies initial to the inside runway (05R/23L) at 400 KIAS. Wingmen fly tactical formation
     (3,000’ lateral from lead aircraft not to exceed the confines of Kadena AB). The lead
     aircraft executes a descending break to arrive on downwind at 1,800 feet MSL. Number
     two pitches simultaneously with lead in a descending break, pauses at 90º (belly check)
     and continues to normal spacing on downwind. Number three delays break to roll out in
     trail with two. The second element follows the same procedures as the lead element. If
     unable to break due to conflict, the lead aircraft turns to Yomitan/Koza (wingmen fluid in
     turn), descends to 2,500 feet MSL once deconfliction is ensured, and re-enters initial.
     4.2.2.7. C-130 High Initial: Aircraft inbound to C-130 High Initial shall fly to the
     outside runway (05L/23R) and maintain the altitude requested with/approved by ATC up
     to 4,500 feet MSL. Aircraft execute a descending break to arrive on downwind at 1,800
     feet MSL. ATC shall not approve C-130 High Initial patterns to the south when the
     fighter aircraft are using the south overhead pattern. ATC shall not approve C-130 High
     Initial patterns to the north if fighter aircraft are using the north overhead pattern for
     emergency purposes.
     4.2.2.8. Protection of the 360º Overhead. To protect the overhead pattern, all departures
     shall cross departure end at or below 1,300 feet MSL, when aircraft are inbound to the
     overhead pattern or when directed by ATC (e.g. paragraph 5.3.3.). If overhead traffic
     will break at or beyond the departure end of the runway, ATC should instruct the aircraft
     to offset the runway to avoid flying over departing aircraft.
     4.2.2.9. Reentry to Initial:
50                                                      KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


         4.2.2.9.1. Yomitan. Aircraft instructed to ―REENTER YOMITAN‖ will climb
         runway heading to 2,000 feet MSL (maintain at or below 1,300 feet until past
         departure end), turn to heading 320 and continue climb to 2,500 feet MSL. Proceed
         to Yomitan airfield, continue southwest Runway 05/northeast bound Runway 23 until
         abeam 3 nm initial, then direct initial. Descend to 1,800 feet MSL when turning
         initial. Remain within 5 DME of Kadena (See Figure A2.15.).
         4.2.2.9.2. Koza. Aircraft instructed to ―REENTER KOZA‖ will climb runway
         heading to at least 2,000 feet MSL (maintain below 1,300 feet until past departure
         end), turn to heading 140 and climb to 2,500 feet MSL. Proceed to Koza (Awase
         Golf Course KAD 140/2.5), continue southwest Runway 05/northeast bound Runway
         23 until abeam 3 nm initial, then proceed direct initial. Descend to 1,800 feet MSL
         when established on initial. Remain within 5 DME of Kadena (See Figure A2.15).
         CAUTION: This pattern over flies the Futenma Class D Surface Area. Do not
         descend below 2,500 feet MSL beyond 3.0 DME south of KAD.
     4.2.2.10. Break-Out.‖ Aircraft instructed to ―BREAK-OUT‖ (normally on the southeast
     downwind) will climb to 2,500 feet MSL and proceed direct to a ―3 MILE INITIAL‖, or
     as directed by Tower (See Figure A2.15).
  4.2.3. RC-135/WC-135/KC-135 / E-3 VFR Procedures.
     4.2.3.1. KC-135 and E-3 VFR Overhead. The weather requirements are the same as for
     the overhead. The KC-135 / E-3 VFR Overhead pattern will be flown on 05L/23R (north
     breaks). All aircraft will acquire radar vectors to initial or will be cleared direct when
     conveniently aligned. KC-135 / E-3 aircraft will maintain 2,500 feet MSL or as
     instructed by controller until lined up on 5 mile initial (6 DME). Once inside 5 mile
     initial, aircraft may descend to 1,800 feet MSL. KC-135/E-3 aircraft are not authorized
     to perform the Koza/Yomitan reentries to initial. Aircraft will remain within the Class D
     airspace at all times during the maneuver. Overhead procedures will be flown IAW AFI
     11-2KC135V3 and E-3 Local Training Guide.
     4.2.3.2. KC-135 / E-3 VFR Arrival. Fly to designated arrival point (NW: Moon Beach –
     26º 26’ 14‖ N 127º 47’ 53‖ E). Cross arrival point at 1,300 feet MSL then proceed VFR
     to the downwind or base for the appropriate runway. Accomplish normal VFR approach
     and landing procedures and remain within the Class D airspace.
  4.2.4. Rectangular Patterns.
     4.2.4.1. Weather Requirements. The minimum reported ceiling of 1,700 feet AGL is
     required for operation in the 1,300 feet MSL rectangular VFR pattern. The VFR
     rectangular pattern may be closed, as required, by the Tower watch supervisor.
     4.2.4.2. Patterns. Aircraft shall enter the pattern at 1,300 feet MSL, or as directed by
     Tower. Normally, pilots shall fly left patterns to Runway 05L and 23L and right patterns
     to Runway 05R and 23R. When flying right patterns to Runway 05L/R, extend
     downwind to ensure ―feet wet‖ prior to turning base, avoid angling final, and be aligned
     with the runway centerline prior to becoming ―feet dry‖ (See Figure A2.16.). Note:
     1,300 feet MSL and north pattern are not authorized for fighter type aircraft.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                              51


     4.2.4.3. Dimensions. Aircraft in the 1,300 feet MSL pattern are required to remain
     within 1 nm southeast of Runway 05R/23L centerline to avoid conflicts with Futenma
     MCAS Class D airspace. KC-135s or other heavy aircraft are not authorized to fly
     rectangular patterns to the south. KC-135s or other heavy aircraft may use Runway
     05R/23L, but must fly the north downwind.
  4.2.5. Closed Traffic Patterns. Aircraft may enter successive VFR closed traffic patterns
  from the upwind leg after obtaining approval from Tower. Aircraft shall use the same
  respective pattern altitudes, dimensions, and restrictions for closed traffic as stated for
  rectangular and 360º overhead patterns. Aircraft shall cross departure end of runway at or
  below 1,300 feet MSL to avoid aircraft in the 360º overhead pattern.
  4.2.6. Helicopter Patterns.
     4.2.6.1. Weather Requirements. The minimum reported ceiling of 1,200 feet AGL is
     required for operation in the 800 feet MSL VFR pattern.
     4.2.6.2. Patterns. Helicopters will conform to established rectangular patterns, except
     pattern altitude will be 800 feet MSL. Approaches to/departures from helipads will be in
     the direction of the designated runway in use, unless otherwise authorized by Tower.
  4.2.7. VFR Straight-In Approaches.
     4.2.7.1. VFR Straight-In Approach. An approach conducted by aircraft on a VFR flight
     plan whereby the aircraft enters the VFR traffic pattern by intercepting the extended
     runway centerline (final approach course) without executing any other portion of the
     traffic pattern. VFR Straight-Ins must be approved by ATC. Note: Aircraft shall
     maintain 2,000’ (when approaching from the NW-NE) and 2,500’ (when approaching
     from SE-SW) until 5 DME.
     4.2.7.2. Straight-In Approach from Yomitan. On departure, request a ―STRAIGHT-IN
     APPROACH‖ from Yomitan. Once approved, maintain 1,300 feet MSL until established
     on a 3-4 nm final. Remain within 5 DME of KAD. Note: Straight-In from Koza is not
     authorized.
  4.2.8. Multiple VFR Approaches.
     4.2.8.1. Termination. When air traffic density precludes multiple VFR approaches,
     Tower may require aircraft to depart the Class D airspace to provide landing sequencing
     with other aircraft. The Tower watch supervisor may direct termination of multiple
     approaches due to traffic density and controller workload.
     4.2.8.2. Coordination. Tower shall coordinate a Naha PCA clearance as necessary and
     assign a frequency to contact Naha Approach Control. The pilot will not depart the Class
     D airspace until IFR clearance or radar service can be provided.
  4.2.9. Local VFR. A local VFR flight is one flown within the local area and originates and
  terminates at Kadena under VMC conditions and is filed with Kadena AMOPS. VFR criteria
  are delineated in command regulations and this chapter. EXCEPTIONS: Locally assigned
  helicopters may terminate at other airfields, heliports, military establishments and non-
  designated landing areas within the local flying area when directed by mission necessity.
  Pilots will notify Kadena AMOPS expeditiously after landing by any means available.

   4.2.10. VFR Departures.
         4.2.10.1. To ensure separation, VFR aircraft departing Class D airspace will obtain
         specific departure instructions and a Naha PCA clearance, if necessary, prior to exiting
         Class D airspace.
         4.2.10.2. Helicopter takeoff may be made from the designated helicopter pad/runway and
         will proceed as directed by Tower. Departures will parallel the runway until clear of the
         airfield boundary and/or cleared by Tower to proceed on appropriate departure route.
   4.2.11. VFR Reporting Points. Aircraft conducting operations outside of Naha PCA
   airspace but in contact with Kadena Tower shall use the VFR reporting points described in
   Table 4.1.

4.3. Special Procedures.
   4.3.1. VFR Recovery in Naha PCA Airspace.
      4.3.1.1. All aircraft that desire flight within the confines of Naha PCA airspace must
      obtain an ATC clearance. To reduce verbiage and frequency congestion, fighter aircraft
      assigned to Kadena AB are automatically cleared to enter the Naha PCA airspace upon
      radar identification and an initial control instruction.
      4.3.1.2. Aircraft equipment requirements. An operational Beacon code with Mode C and
      a two-way radio capable of communications with ATC. The approach control watch
      supervisor may authorize a deviation from the altitude reporting equipment immediately
      upon request based on workload.
      4.3.1.3. Assignment of radar headings, routes or altitudes is based on the provision that a
      pilot operating IAW VFR is expected to advise ATC if compliance will cause a violation
      of any part of the applicable Code of Federal Regulations.
   4.3.2. Operations in Kadena Class D Surface Area. All aircraft shall remain within 5 nm
   from center of the airfield unless deviation is specifically approved by Tower. Aircraft
   within 5 nm of Kadena AB should maintain a minimum altitude of 1,000 feet MSL, except
   during flight on approved VFR entry and exit routes, during takeoff and landing, in the VFR
   traffic pattern, when directed by ATC, or on instrument approaches.
      4.3.2.1. Communications in Kadena Class D Surface Area. All aircraft shall maintain
      two-way radio contact via UHF/VHF with Tower. All UHF equipped aircraft shall
      utilize tower UHF frequency while operating in the Kadena traffic pattern. This reduces
      the potential for separate aircraft to simulcast on UHF and VHF, provides aircrew
      improved situational awareness, and improves local control’s ability to receive and
      understand aircraft transmissions.
      4.3.2.2. Unusual Maneuvers in Class D airspace. Unusual maneuvers are defined as any
      maneuver not necessary for normal flight. Unusual maneuvers are not authorized within
      Kadena’s Class D airspace without 18 OG/CC approval. Submit any requests for unusual
      maneuvers to 18 OG/CC.
54                                                       KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


     4.3.2.3. Acrobatic Flight. No aircraft will conduct acrobatic flight in Kadena’s Class D
     Airspace.
  4.3.3. Special VFR (SVFR).         Kadena Arrival is the approval authority for all SVFR
  operations within the Kadena AB and MCAS Futenma Class D airspaces. No aircraft shall
  be authorized to enter, depart, operate within, or transit Class D airspace under SVFR unless
  ATC clearance has been received from Kadena Arrival. When Kadena Arrival is closed
  Naha Approach assumes this authority.
  4.3.4. Altitude Restricted Low Approach. An altitude restricted low approach with a vertical
  restriction of not less than 650 feet MSL (500 feet AGL) or 1,150 feet MSL (1,000 feet
  AGL) for heavy aircraft may be authorized, except over an aircraft in takeoff position or a
  departing aircraft.
     4.3.4.1. When issuing an altitude restricted low approach due to personnel on the
     runway, Tower shall ensure that personnel on the runway are informed of the intended
     operation prior to the aircraft reaching two miles from the runway, or prior to VFR
     pattern traffic turning base leg.
  4.3.5. Parachute Drop Zone (DZ) Procedures.
     4.3.5.1. Parachute drop zone procedures within or through the Naha PCA airspace for Ie-
     Shima, Ridout, Ourawan, Ukibaru, and Tsken-Jima DZs are contained in the Transfer
     Agreement.
         4.3.5.1.1. Paradrops in Whiskey 178. Refer to Marine Corps Base, Camp Butler,
         Base Order P3500.2 for detailed coordination procedures.
         4.3.5.1.2. Paradrops at Ie-Shima, Ourawan, Ukibaru, and Tsken-Jima DZs below the
         Okinawa Naha PCA airspace will use the following procedures:
             4.3.5.1.2.1. Coordination. Any organization requesting paradrop operations
             within the confines of Naha Approach Control airspace shall coordinate with 18
             WG Scheduling at least one week in advance. Per Okinawa ATC Agreement, Tab
             F, Attachment 2, phone verification for tentative approval by ATC is the
             responsibility of the requesting organization based on weather, present and/or
             forecasted traffic, etc.. AMOPS will post required NOTAMs based on approved
             Wing Scheduling slides.
             4.3.5.1.2.2. ATC requires the following information: Date and time of the
             paradrop activity, call sign, type and number of aircraft involved, drop area (e.g.,
             KAD 114/09), drop altitude (e.g., 4,000 feet and below), point of contact name,
             and phone number.
         4.3.5.1.3. Paradrops at Ridout will use the following procedures:
             4.3.5.1.3.1. 18 OSS/OSOS shall coordinate all requests with 18 OSS/OSA
             through the 18 OG Scheduling Meeting at least 2 weeks prior to scheduling
             rescue training. Coordination shall include: rescue operations training activity
             (Free Fall, Static Line), type aircraft, area, altitudes, times of usage, and
             requesting agency point of contact information. 18 OSS/OSOS shall also
             deconflict rescue training and other military training/real-world missions and
             advise all partner and 18 WG flying organizations through the weekly scheduling
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                               55


          meeting.
          4.3.5.1.3.2. Parajump Operators shall:
             4.3.5.1.3.2.1. Coordinate with the JOSC/OSOS to schedule jump times.
             4.3.5.1.3.2.2. Coordinate use of designated parajump airspace with 18
             OSS/OSA at least 48 hours prior to usage. 18 OSS/OSA will require the
             following information: callsign, type, number of operations, parajump
             activity, requested altitudes, and times of usage.
             4.3.5.1.3.2.3. Not control non-participating vehicle or aircraft movement
             through the RIDOUT DZ.
             4.3.5.1.3.2.4. Ensure all parajump vehicle operations conducted on the
             airfield are in compliance with local airfield/flight line driving procedures and
             all vehicle operators have a valid Kadena AB airfield driver's license (AF
             Form 483).
             4.3.5.1.3.2.5. The Drop Zone Safety Officer (DZSO) must establish/maintain
             communications with TWR throughout the parachute operations operation on
             the local UHF Ground Control Frequency/275.8. The DZSO will also monitor
             UHF 270.6(Primary) or 317.8 (Backup). This is the frequency that the aircrew
             will be switched to by TWR or Kadena Arrival Control prior to paradrop
             operations. The DZSO can make limited essential radio calls on this frequency
             (Clear to drop/abort /confirmation of parachutists and wind calls on this
             frequency).
               4.3.5.1.3.2.5.1. DZSO shall request access to the RIDOUT DZ from TWR.
               This access authorizes the DZSO to enter the RIDOUT DZ area and set up
               equipment and establish radio communications. The DZSO shall request and
               receive permission from TWR prior to entering the runway(s) each time
               access is needed.
               4.3.5.1.3.2.5.2. DZSO shall request "Control" of RIDOUT DZ from TWR
               prior to parajump operations. This is normally 10-15 minutes prior to
               commencing parajump operations. This "Control" authorizes the DZSO to
               operate within the RIDOUT DZ area until "Control" is relinquished. NOTE:
               "Control" is defined as authority of surface operations only within the
               RIDOUT DZ.
               4.3.5.1.3.2.5.3. Notify TWR when the DZ has been checked for safety and
               is ready for operations to commence.
               4.3.5.1.3.2.5.4. Notify TWR when all Parajump Operators are out of the
               aircraft.
               4.3.5.1.3.2.5.5. Notify TWR when all Parajump Operators are on the
               ground. This notification returns the airspace to the TWR.
               4.3.5.1.3.2.5.6. Relinquish "Control" of RIDOUT DZ to TWR upon
               completion of parajump operations, or when required by TWR for safety.
               This notification authorizes TWR to resume all surface operations. The
 56                                                       KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


                   DZSO must comply with all TWR instructions.
              4.3.5.1.3.3. TWR Shall:
                 4.3.5.1.3.3.1. During active RIDOUT DZ operations (distinguished when
                 DZSO gains "Control" of RIDOUT DZ), not taxi any aircraft while DZSO has
                 "Control" of RIDOUT DZ. Aircraft will be in their parking locations or
                 airborne prior to TWR releasing "Control" of the DZ.
                 4.3.5.1.3.3.2. Ensure fighter aircraft on the Upper Fighter Ramp are the only
                 aircraft on the airfield that may have their engines on during active RIDOUT
                 DZ operations.
                 4.3.5.1.3.3.3. Relinquish "Control" of RIDOUT DZ to the Parajump
                 Operators, when requested, based on existing traffic conditions. Note:
                 "Control" is defined as authority of surface operations only within the
                 RIDOUT DZ.
                 4.3.5.1.3.3.4. Not allow non-participating vehicles to enter the RIDOUT DZ
                 beyond the VFR hold lines at the respective taxiway intersections while the
                 DZSO has "Control" of the DZ.
                 4.3.5.1.3.3.5. Prior to notification that the area is ready for operations, in the
                 interest of safety, may regain "Control" without consent.
                 4.3.5.1.3.3.6. Resume normal runway operations only after a FOD check has
                 been completed by AMOPS.
              4.3.5.1.3.4. Airfield Management Operations Shall:
                 4.3.5.1.3.4.1. Notify 18th Wing Command Post            and Security Forces of
                 proposed rescue training activity.
                 4.3.5.1.3.4.2. Perform a runway and taxiway check after RIDOUT parajump
                 operations to ensure potential FOD sources are not left on the field.
   4.3.6. Functional Check Flights (FCF). A FCF aircraft will normally fly standard mission
   profiles and require no special handling. Note: Standard takeoff for FCF aircraft is a static
   departure. ATC will not solicit rolling/immediate takeoffs from FCF aircraft.
4.4. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). RSRS is authorized for aircraft under the
control of the Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMPACFLT) and COMMARFORPAC at bases
under control of Commander, Pacific Air Forces IAW Joint Letter of Agreement on Reduced
Same Runway Separation at Pacific Air Force Bases, dated 27 Jul 2006.
   4.4.1. PACAF bases are authorized to apply the following minimum RSRS standards to
   aircraft controlled by COMPACFLT and COMMARFORPAC aircraft under the following
   conditions:
      4.4.1.1. Air traffic controllers are able to see the aircraft involved and determine
      distances by references to suitable landmarks.
      4.4.1.2. Any aircrew or air traffic controller may refuse RSRS when safety of flight may
      be jeopardized. In these cases, the appropriate separation standards published in the
      FAAO JO 7110.65 will be applied.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                     57


     4.4.1.3. Revert to nighttime RSRS standards when the runway condition reading (RCR)
     is reported to be between 16 and 12 inclusive, or when RCR is not available and runway
     surface condition is reported as wet, ice, or snow.
     4.4.1.4. For fighter-type aircraft only. A low-approach following a full stop shall use the
     alternate side of the runway when passing the aircraft on landing roll. Aircraft will not
     over-fly aircraft on the runway. Responsibility for separation rests with the pilot.
     Controllers must provide appropriate traffic advisories to aircraft involved. Advisories
     will be issued prior to the aircraft reaching a critical phase of flight.
     4.4.1.5. Pilots are responsible for wake turbulence separation when maintaining visual
     separation or operating under VFR. Controllers must provide appropriate cautionary
     wake turbulence advisories in these cases.
     4.4.1.6. Same aircraft operations mean the same airframe, e.g., F-15 behind F-15, F/A-18
     behind F/A-18, C-130 behind C-130.
     4.4.1.7. Dissimilar fighter-type aircraft operations mean not the same airframe, e.g., F-15
     behind F-14, F/A-18 behind A-10, etc.
     4.4.1.8. Non-heavy, non-fighter-type aircraft operations mean C-130, C-12, B-737, etc.
     4.4.1.9. RSRS between formation full stops (holding hands) is authorized provided all
     aircraft involved are the same type aircraft (e.g. all F/A-18s, etc.). Separation is
     measured between the trailing aircraft in the lead formation and the lead aircraft in the
     trailing formation.
  4.4.2. Reduced same runway separation standards do not apply:
     4.4.2.1. To any situation involving an emergency aircraft.
     4.4.2.2. To civil aircraft.
     4.4.2.3. To air evacuation aircraft.
     4.4.2.4. To a touch-and-go behind a full stop.
     4.4.2.5. To ―heavy‖ aircraft as classified IAW FAAO JO 7110.65 (aircraft capable of
     takeoff weights of more than 300,000 lbs).
     4.4.2.6. When the RCR is less than 12 or breaking action reports of less than fair are
     reported.
  4.4.3. Controllers control formation flights as a single aircraft and do not apply RSRS
  standards between aircraft in the same formation (FAAO JO 7110.65, 2-1-13). Separation
  between aircraft within the formation is the responsibility of the flight leader and pilots of the
  other aircraft in the flight (FAAO JO 7110.65, Pilot/Controller Glossary).
  4.4.4. Daytime RSRS Standards.

4.5. Intersection Departures.
   4.5.1. General. Intersection departures are not authorized for 18 WG aircraft without an
   authorized waiver, with the exception of Aero Club aircraft and helicopters. Otherwise,
   intersection departures may be authorized by the Tower from any intersection if the aircraft
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                               59


   commander concurs and traffic flow permits. Kadena AB uses the intersection departure
   procedures prescribed in FAAO JO 7110.65.
   4.5.2. Procedures. Tower will issue appropriate distance remaining from the intersection to
   military aircraft (See Table 4.4).

                                     IFR PROCEDURES

5.1. Radar Traffic Patterns.
   5.1.1. Local Radar Traffic Pattern/Multiple Instrument Approaches
      5.1.1.1. Pilots will contact Naha Approach Control or Kadena Arrival on the appropriate
      frequency, state the type approach requested, how the approach will terminate if other
      than a full stop, and intentions to follow.
      5.1.1.2. To protect the overhead pattern, pilots executing missed approach shall not
      climb above 1,300 feet MSL until crossing the departure end of runway.
      5.1.1.3. Radar In-Trail. Radar In-Trail recovery is limited to a maximum of four aircraft
      and will not terminate in PAR or ASR approaches. Aircrews conducting radar in-trail
      recoveries are responsible for separation between elements of their flight while on final
      for full-stop landings. To ensure appropriate departure separation, multiple practice radar
      in-trail approaches that do not terminate with a full-stop landing shall be conducted only
      in VMC. During practice approaches in VMC conditions, after an executed low
      approach/landing, the flight is responsible for their own separation until ATC completes
      flight split-ups providing individual control. Note: In order to assist pilots with their
      flight splits, the lead aircraft can expect to execute standard radar climb-out and the
      trailing aircraft can expect to fly runway heading.
5.1.2. Transition Procedures (Split-to-Land).
      5.1.2.1. In order to expedite recoveries and add flexibility to arrival operations at Kadena
      AB, base-assigned or attached fighter aircraft may execute transition procedures to the
      parallel runway.
      5.1.2.2. Terminology:
          5.1.2.2.1. ―Split-to-land‖ indicates a flight of two aircraft will accomplish an
          instrument approach to a runway. One aircraft will continue the straight-in approach,
          and the other aircraft will offset to land on the parallel runway.
          5.1.2.2.2. ―Transition-to-land‖ indicates an aircraft (or two-ship in non-standard trail)
          will accomplish an instrument approach to a runway and offset to land on the parallel
          runway.
      5.1.2.3. Procedures:
          5.1.2.3.1. The aircraft maneuvering to the parallel runway is considered to be
          executing a circling approach at circling approach minima.
          5.1.2.3.2. Since the maneuver is considered a circling approach, the approach flown
          will not be a precision approach under normal circumstances. TACAN, localizer, and
          ASR approaches shall be requested along with split-to-land or transition-to-land
          procedures.
          5.1.2.3.3. Pilots will not begin the transition maneuver prior to the final approach fix
          (FAF), with the landing runway in sight. Maintain circling minimum descent altitude
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                    61


          (MDA) until reaching the point at which a normal descent to land on the parallel
          runway can be started.
      5.1.2.4. Landing Options:
          5.1.2.4.1. Full Stop.
          5.1.2.4.2. Low approach to Tower for one or both aircraft (only authorized if the
          traffic pattern is open).
          5.1.2.4.3. Low approach to the radar pattern for one aircraft only. The other aircraft
          must full stop or enter the overhead traffic pattern. If both aircraft will low approach,
          the aircraft entering the radar pattern must accomplish the low approach to the
          ―outside runway‖ (Runway 05L or 23R) to avoid conflict at the departure end of the
          runway.
      5.1.2.5. The Tower may direct a VFR aircraft or request an IFR aircraft on final
      approach to transition to the parallel runway. When the aircraft reports the final approach
      fix (or other designated point in space), controller phraseology will be: ―CIRCLE TO
      RUNWAY (05R or 23L), WIND, RUNWAY (05R or 23L), CLEARED TO LAND.‖ A
      pilot receiving this clearance will maneuver the aircraft to align with the appropriate
      runway. Normally, notification to transition to a parallel runway will be issued no less
      than 5 NM from the runway, unless the pilot requests to change runways.
5.2. Availability/Restrictions for Surveillance (ASR) Approaches and Precision Approach
Radar (PAR) Approaches/Monitoring.
   5.2.1. Flight Following and Radar Monitoring Instrument Approaches.
      5.2.1.1. GCA will flight follow aircraft executing non-precision approaches using the
      Terminal Controller Workstation (TCW) when the reported weather is less than a 1500
      feet ceiling, visibility is less than 5 miles, at night, or upon pilot request.
      5.2.1.2. GCA will radar monitor aircraft executing precision approaches using the PAR
      indicator during PAR operational hours when the reported weather is less than a 1500
      feet ceiling, visibility is less than 5 miles, at night, or upon pilot request.
      5.2.1.3. GCA shall not simultaneously monitor/flight follow more than two single ship
      aircraft, two flights of two aircraft, or one flight of three or four aircraft.
   5.2.2. Non-Standard Fighter Recoveries.
      5.2.2.1. General. Fighter aircraft may recover in a non-standard formation.            Non-
      standard formations shall not recover via PAR or ASR approaches.
          5.2.2.1.1. Non-Standard formation approaches must be approved by ATC.
          5.2.2.1.2. All instructions issued by ATC apply to the entire flight, including
          clearance for the approach and clearance to land, unless specific instructions are
          given for individual flight elements.
      5.2.2.2. Pilots Shall:
          5.2.2.2.1. Request non-standard approach from ATC and include type landing (e.g.,
          ―Bat 01, 2 ship, request ILS non-standard, 5 left, full stop‖).
 62                                                        KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


          5.2.2.2.2. Upon going non-standard, the lead aircraft will continue to squawk Mode-
          C on the approach control assigned discrete beacon code. The last element of the
          flight will squawk Mode-C and the non-discrete 5300 beacon code.
          5.2.2.2.3. Establish non-standard trail formation while in VMC. Spacing will not
          exceed 2 nm between flight elements unless otherwise authorized by ATC. Each
          aircraft will fly the approach as published and initiate descent at the normal descent
          point.
          5.2.2.2.4. If lost communications occur after the flight is established in non-standard
          formation, squawk beacon code 7600 and continue the approach.                   If lost
          communications occur in conjunction with an in-flight emergency, squawk beacon
          code 7700 and continue with the approach (Refer to Lost Communication Procedures
          in Chapter 8).
      5.2.2.3. ATC shall only vector the lead aircraft of the flight.
5.3. Local Departure Procedures.
   5.3.1. Clearance Delivery. All aircraft proposing to depart Kadena AB on an IFR clearance
   should contact Kadena Clearance Delivery on frequency 235.0 or 123.3 prior to engine start,
   but no earlier than 30 minutes before proposed departure time.
      5.3.1.1. When delay is expected or the altitude requested cannot be assigned for long-
      range flight, ATC shall provide pilots with an expected departure clearance time (EDCT).
      5.3.1.2. Updated information on expected clearance times will be passed directly to the
      aircraft on the clearance delivery frequency.
      5.3.1.3. If delay is due to non-receipt of IFR flight plan by Naha ACC, aircraft will be
      requested to contact AMOPS on frequency 266.0 or 131.4. IAW AFI 13-204V3, Chapter
      15 AMOPS is not authorized to accept original flight plans via air-to-ground radio.
      AMOPS is the single point of contact for filing flight plans. ATC is not authorized to
      input nor relay flight plans to AMOPS. However, locally filed flight plans can be
      amended by any means prior to departure provided an original flight plan is on file at the
      departure AMOPS section.
   5.3.2. Whiskey Clearances. Local stereo round-robin clearances to/from Warning Areas.
   Pilots shall depart on a local IFR clearance issued by Clearance Delivery via the published
   JILEE TWO (RWY)05 or TUCOF (#) (RWY23) standard instrument departure procedure
   (see current DoD FLIP). Pilots will be cleared to the entry/exit fix (OTMI, ELSOL, ZIDEN,
   JUMTI or UKIKA) associated with the requested warning area. EXAMPLE: ―Cock 01,
   Cleared to ZIDEN, via JILEE TWO Departure, RADAR vectors/direct ZIDEN, maintain
   10,000 expect FL190, departure frequency local channel 4, squawk XXXX.
      5.3.2.1. Entry/Exit Fix Locations:
ELSOL-KAD 075/40 (N26:34:37.77 E128:28:12.45)
ZIDEN-KAD 097/40 (N26:19:26.42 E128:30:35.84)
JUMTI-KAD 175/35 (N25:46.7 E127:52.2)
OTIMI-KAD 325/35 (N26:48.7 E127:21.5)
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                  63


     5.3.2.2. Aircraft requesting to depart as a non-standard formation must advise Kadena
     Tower prior to taxiing. The last element and/or aircraft must squawk code 5300 on
     departure.
     5.3.2.3. When departing as a flight of four (2 x 2), the second element will be issued a
     separate beacon code than lead. EXAMPLE: ―…Cock 01, Squawk 5310, Cock 03,
     Squawk 5313 on Stand-by.‖ Cock 03 will then squawk normal on 5313 if recovering as a
     separate flight.
     5.3.2.4. Unless issued a MARSA clearance to enter the training airspace, pilots must
     report reaching VMC and cancel IFR prior to reaching the entry point in order to proceed
     VFR into the warning areas. If unable to reach VMC, maintain assigned altitude within
     40 DME and advise Naha Approach.
     5.3.2.5. In order to prevent possible Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System
     (TCAS) Resolution Advisories for civilian airliners vs. fighters, pilots shall be instructed
     to maintain a specified altitude (e.g., ―10,000‖) and remain with Naha Approach even
     after reaching/reporting VMC and canceling IFR. Once possible conflicts are
     resolved/no longer a factor, pilots will be allowed to change frequency.
     5.3.2.6. All aircraft exiting the Warning Areas shall contact Naha Approach at the
     appropriate recovery entry/exit fix.
  5.3.3. Departures.
     5.3.3.1. Altitude Restrictions. If directed by ATC, departing aircraft shall maintain at or
     below 1,300 feet MSL until the departure end-of-runway to protect the overhead traffic
     pattern. All pilots are expected to climb out as published in this regulation or as
     published on the Departure Procedure.
     5.3.3.2. Other Restrictions. No battle-box takeoffs, simultaneous single ship takeoffs
     from parallel runways, or other non-standard departures will be authorized without 18
     OG/CC coordination and approval. Note: To the maximum extent possible, after-burner
     equipped aircraft should depart on Runway 05R/23L for noise abatement.
     5.3.3.3. Unrestricted Climbs. All unrestricted climbs must be approved by the 18
     OG/CC. Requests for unrestricted climbs should be made at the weekly 18 OG/CC
     scheduling meeting. In certain circumstances, unrestricted climbs may be approved by
     18 OG/CC following coordination through the SOF and respective units. Once approved,
     coordination with ATC is required before conducting such activity.
  5.3.4. Silent Launch Procedures (Steel Tiger).
     5.3.4.1. Coordination:    All silent launches will be coordinated with Airfield
     Management, Tower, and Naha Approach or Kadena Arrival at least 24 hours in advance
     before scheduled launch time, but not later than two hours before the scheduled launch
     time, unless precluded by security considerations, in which case they will be coordinated
     as soon as possible. Note: Steel Tiger operations are not authorized during Alternate
     Tower operations due to visibility.
     5.3.4.2. Eligibility: All locally-based aircraft are eligible to use these procedures.
64                                                       KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


     5.3.4.3. Runway:     All launches will be on Runway 05L/23R unless otherwise
     coordinated.
     5.3.4.4. Safety: As a safeguard, aircraft will monitor guard frequency at all times. In the
     case of any unusual or emergency situation, radio silence shall be broken at the discretion
     of the controller or pilot. SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT. Flight leaders will make all
     required communications unless safety or mission dictates otherwise. Under no
     circumstances will anyone compromise safety for radio silent procedures. If a safety
     problem arises or briefed timing cannot be met, TALK ON THE RADIO.
     5.3.4.5. Mission Aircraft/Parent Organization shall:
        5.3.4.5.1. Provide AMOPS with a completed flight plan with the phrase ―Steel Tiger‖
        highlighted in the remarks section.
        5.3.4.5.2. During mission planning, the aircrew/unit will deliver the following
        information to AMOPS at least two hours prior to planned departure time. Unless
        precluded by security considerations, this action will be accomplished as soon as
        possible.
            5.3.4.5.2.1. Aircraft Call Sign (lead aircraft) and parking spot.
            5.3.4.5.2.2. Wingmen Call Signs and parking spots.
            5.3.4.5.2.3. Spare Aircraft Call Sign and parking spot.
            5.3.4.5.2.4. Proposed departure date.
            5.3.4.5.2.5. Proposed departure time.
            5.3.4.5.2.6. Requested engine start time (departure time minus 25 minutes).
            5.3.4.5.2.7. Requested taxi time (departure time minus 15 minutes).
            5.3.4.5.2.8. Requested hold line time (departure time minus 10 minutes).
        5.3.4.5.3. Put a ―Block Time‖ 45 minutes prior to takeoff time to ensure the
        clearance is ready. Clearance should be ready from Kadena Clearance Delivery hour
        prior to launch time, and will contain instructions for departing both Runways 05/23.
        5.3.4.5.4. Obtain IFR clearances using one of the following procedures:
            5.3.4.5.4.1. Furnish a runner to pick up IFR clearances. They may be picked up
            at the Clearance Delievary.
            5.3.4.5.4.2. Coordinate for a crewmember to pick up the ATC clearance and
            deliver it to the crew.
        5.3.4.5.5. Ensure mission aircraft taxi according to the timing sheet plus or minus
        five minutes. Any aircraft not able to meet their scheduled times must use normal
        radio procedures for taxi. Ground spare aircraft that will taxi in the departure flow
        shall be identified in the remarks section of the timing sheet.
        5.3.4.5.6. Notify ATC if taxi and/or takeoff times will be delayed or if the launch
        will be canceled.
     5.3.4.6. Aircrew Procedures:
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                  65


        5.3.4.6.1. Aircrew will monitor ground, tower, and departure ATC frequencies at the
        appropriate times.
        5.3.4.6.2. Taxi: Monitor ATIS for current active runway and taxi on time after
        visually clearing the taxi route. Stop at the hammerhead for Runway 05L/23R and
        point the aircraft away from Tower until ready to cross or take off. When ready to
        cross, turn the aircraft toward Tower and flash the taxi/landing lights. Tower will
        respond with a flashing green light gun signal to authorize taxi across a runway. A
        steady red light gun signal or lack of light signal indicates to hold position. Non-
        standard taxi flows due to taxiway closures will be coordinated at the time the silent
        launch scheduling sheet is brought to the Tower. Any deviation from the scheduled
        taxi route will require additional coordination. Caution: Do not mistake airfield
        rotating beacon for light gun signal. Note: All departures will be from Runway
        05L/23R, unless prior coordination and approval have been accomplished with
        Tower.
        5.3.4.6.3. Takeoff: When ready for takeoff, turn toward Tower and flash taxi/landing
        lights again. The Tower will respond with a steady green light gun signal as
        clearance for takeoff. Receipt of a steady green light gun signal is both takeoff
        clearance and clearance to switch to departure control frequency. A steady red light
        gun signal or lack of a light signal indicates to hold position.
        5.3.4.6.4. Departure: When cleared for takeoff, aircraft will switch to departure
        control frequency and squawk assigned beacon code. Departure control will address
        the aircraft by its beacon code. EXAMPLE: ―(Beacon Code) RADAR CONTACT
        PASSING (altitude).‖ Once airborne, acknowledge all radio transmissions from
        Naha Approach Control or Kadena Arrival, including handoff to Naha Area Control
        Center, with an ―IDENT‖ on assigned beacon code. Once with Naha Area Control
        Center, normal radio procedures will be used. For departures into the radar pattern,
        normal radio procedures begin after the aircraft has turned crosswind.
        5.3.4.6.5. Coordinate an opposite direction departure by runner, at least 15 minutes
        prior to taxiing. Most launches will not be able to accept any tailwind for takeoff.
        Helicopters will taxi to the rescue pad hold-short line and flash landing light to obtain
        approval to taxi onto the pad for hover-checks. Tower will indicate approval with a
        flashing green light. When ready for takeoff, the helicopter will turn toward Tower
        and flash landing light, Tower will indicate takeoff clearance with a steady green
        light. Helicopters will depart on requested standard VFR departures.
     5.3.4.7. ATC Procedures (GCA):
        5.3.4.7.1. Kadena Clearance Delivery shall request clearance from Naha Area
        Control Center utilizing normal procedures. Have a hard copy available one hour
        prior to departure time.
        5.3.4.7.2. Naha Approach Control shall identify the aircraft using the aircraft beacon
        code as the aircraft’s call sign.
        5.3.4.7.3. Naha Approach Control shall use normal procedures to initiate a
        handoff/transfer of control with Naha Area Control Center.

       5.3.4.8. Tower shall:
          5.3.4.8.1. Monitor Engine Start and Taxi.
          5.3.4.8.2. Use a flashing green light gun signal to approve an aircraft across an active
          runway. If temporarily unable to approve crossing, Tower will issue a steady red
          light gun signal. When able to approve crossing, Tower will issue a flashing green
          light gun signal. Tower will use a steady green light gun signal to clear aircraft for
          departure and frequency change.
          5.3.4.8.3. Request release 5 minutes prior to scheduled takeoff, using the beacon
          code as the aircraft call sign.
          5.3.4.8.4. At 15 minutes prior to takeoff time, ensure Automatic Terminal
          Information System (ATIS) is current. At 5 minutes prior to takeoff time, confirm
          temperature, pressure altitude, and departure end winds are current on ATIS
          broadcast. Relay any changes to aircrew by UHF broadcast in-the-blind.
       5.3.4.9. Other Agencies Responsibilities:
          5.3.4.9.1. Scheduling will annotate the silent launch on the weekly flying schedule.
          5.3.4.9.2. Command Post will not initiate any radio calls to the aircraft unless there is
          a problem requiring use of the radio.
          5.3.4.9.3. Base transportation will be briefed on the aircrew pick up time and place
          with special emphasis on not using telephones to discuss the pick-up (unless using
          Secure Telephone Unit/Secure Terminal Equipment [STU-III/STE]).
          5.3.4.9.4. Base Weather shall update the New Tactical Forecast System 15 minutes
          prior to proposed departure time.
5.4. Radar Vectors to Initial Procedures.
   5.4.1. IFR Arrival Procedures.
       5.4.1.1. The primary method of recovery for locally assigned fighter aircraft returning
       from the warning areas is to the overhead pattern via direct initial (traffic permitting)
       and/or radar vectors. The alternate method is an instrument approach. If unable to
       recover VFR, pilots should ask for an ―IFR Pick-up‖ and request radar vectors to initial
       or vectors for an instrument approach.
       5.4.1.2. Aircraft will receive IFR service upon receipt of 'RADAR Contact' from ATC.
       5.4.1.3. To reduce verbiage and frequency congestion, fighter aircraft assigned to
       Kadena AB are automatically cleared to enter Naha PCA airspace upon radar
       identification and initial control instruction.
       5.4.1.4. Naha Approach Control will vector IFR arrivals via enroute descent for a
       precision approach, unless the pilot requests another approach on initial contact. Kadena
       GCA maintains dual PAR capability during times published in the DoD FLIP for Kadena
       AB.
       5.4.1.5. Naha Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) Outage. PAR approaches may be
       conducted when the Naha ASR is unusable, provided the aircraft is Tactical Air
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                   67


      Navigation (TACAN), VHF Omni-Directional Range (VOR)-DME, or Global
      Positioning System (GPS) equipped and capable. A published instrument approach
      procedure is used to position the aircraft within PAR coverage.
      5.4.1.6. Due to Naha Approach Control radar capabilities, arriving VFR-On-Top aircraft
      will recover squawking the same beacon code issued for their departure. Aircraft not
      assigned a discrete beacon code (e.g., Bat 2 recovers prior to lead), will recover
      squawking 5400. Naha Approach Control will then assign a discrete beacon code. This
      enables the ATC radar to display call sign, beacon code, altitude, ground speed, and other
      information to expedite the flow of traffic.
      5.4.1.7. Straight-In Approach (IFR). Any instrument approach wherein final approach is
      begun without first having executed a procedure turn (i.e. ILS, VOR/DME, TACAN,
      GPS and visual approaches). Note: Circling is not authorized northwest of the field.
      5.4.1.8. Visual Approach. An approach conducted on an IFR flight plan which
      authorizes the pilot to proceed visually and clear of clouds to the airport. The pilot must,
      at all times, have either the airport or preceding aircraft in sight. The Visual Approach
      must be authorized and under control of ATC. Note: Aircraft shall maintain 2,000’
      (when approaching from the NW-NE) and 2,500’ (when approaching from SE-SW) until
      5 DME.
5.5. IFR Refueling.
   5.5.1. Flight Plan Procedures:
      5.5.1.1. Contact AMOPS to file the appropriate flight plan for the scheduled refueling
      track.
      5.5.1.2. Pass call signs, departure times, and tail numbers, etc., as per normal DD Form
      1801 filing procedures.
   5.5.2. Sequencing. The tanker will normally take off after all receivers are airborne. During
   VFR conditions, the fighters will fly a rectangular pattern and the tanker(s) will take off
   when the receivers are downwind abeam the field. Once tankers are airborne, the fighters
   will turn crosswind and rejoin on the tanker in the climb. During IFR conditions, the fighters
   will depart to the first point of the ALTRV and hold. ATC will be used to the max extent
   possible to provide altitude de-confliction until rejoined.
   5.5.3. Rendezvous. When cleared, flight leads will proceed direct to the entry point, FL 240,
   or as cleared by Naha Center. Clearance to the entry point is clearance for the rendezvous
   via a point parallel or fighter turn-on.
   5.5.4. Weather Conditions. Tanker Crews shall pass weather conditions in the refueling
   track to Shogun 10 if actual instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) refueling is
   expected for 18 WG aircraft.
   5.5.5. Transition. With the last receiver on the boom, the tanker will coordinate exit
   procedures with Naha Center. Once within radio range of destination, receivers may depart
   the ALTRV and work their own clearance as desired for recovery prior to the tankers.

5.6. 909th Air Refueling Squadron (909 ARS) Special Operations.
   5.6.1. Responsibilities. Aircraft commanders assume responsibility for the safe separation of
   aircraft when military assumes responsibility for separation of aircraft (MARSA) is specified
   in the ―Other Information‖ section of the flight plan or on the ALTRV.
   5.6.2. Cell Procedures.
      5.6.2.1. A ―cell‖ operation shall be handled as a formation flight. Separation within a
      cell is the responsibility of the cell leader and MARSA procedures will apply.
      5.6.2.2. For cell departures, Tower will issue taxi, takeoff, and departure clearance to the
      lead aircraft pilot, who will acknowledge for the cell. Succeeding aircraft will normally
      take off at 30-to-60 second intervals behind the lead aircraft.
      5.6.2.3. Ground spare aircraft may sequence into cells or depart single ship as required
      by aircraft aborts. Ground spare aircraft will file individual flight plans and use a
      separate call sign from the primary aircraft.
      5.6.2.4. 909 ARS Supervisor of flying frequency (Tiger Ops) is 311.0.
5.7. 33d Rescue Squadron Standardized Air Refueling Tracks.
   5.7.1. General. The scheduling office has established the following tracks with Marine Air
   Refueler and Transport Squadron (VMGR-152) and the 17th Special Operations Squadron
   (17 SOS) in order to ease scheduling conflicts. The Shark Rock AR track is the primary
   track for work with the 17 SOS, with Shooter track as the alternate for training in the vicinity
   of W-174.
      5.7.1.1. The names, coordinates, headings, and IMC procedures for the 33 RQS standard
      air refueling (AR) tracks are as follows:

                                  EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

6.1. General. Due to the limited number of alternate airfields near Kadena, all personnel must
strive to minimize runway closure times due to disabled aircraft or arrested landings. Aircrews
should notify the ATC agency they are in contact with at least 15 minutes before an arrested
landing, when possible. The on-scene commander will coordinate with Airfield Management
and determine the following:
   6.1.1. The requirement to reopen the runway for operational use.
   6.1.2. The need to prevent initial or secondary damage to the aircraft.
   6.1.3. The requirement to gather and preserve evidence for accident investigation.
   6.1.4. Sweepers will respond to all barrier engagements, blown tire emergencies, and any
   other emergencies with a FOD potential.
6.2. Operation of the Primary Crash Alarm System and Secondary Crash Net.
   6.2.1. Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS). The following agencies are on the PCAS (all
   agencies must have 2-way capability with a push-to-talk feature): Tower, AMOPS, 18 CES
   FES, and 18th Medical Group (18 MDG) Clinic. The following emergency conditions will
   be relayed via PCAS:
       6.2.1.1. In-Flight emergencies declared by the pilot or officials responsible for the
       operation of the aircraft.
       6.2.1.2. Ground Emergencies.
       6.2.1.3. Any aircraft in a distress or urgency condition which includes the terms
       ―MAYDAY‖ and/or ―PAN-PAN.‖
       6.2.1.4. Dropped Object (Canopy, Fuel Tanks, etc.).
       6.2.1.5. Aircraft Arresting System Engagement. Note: This does not include preplanned
       engagements when coordinated with all concerned agencies.
       6.2.1.6. Known or Suspected Hijack and/or Theft.

       chase pilot can confirm no other problems exist with the NORDO aircraft.
       6.2.1.13. Base Exercises Involving ATC Facilities, Airfield, or Air Traffic Operations.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                71


        6.2.1.13.1. The PCAS will only be activated for exercises in response to an inject or
        at the direction of an EET member.
        6.2.1.13.2. Preface and terminate all exercise PCAS activations with ―EXERCISE,
        EXERCISE, EXERCISE.‖
     6.2.1.14. Tower/GCA Evacuation.
     6.2.1.15. Blown tire.
     6.2.1.16. If, in the judgment of the controller, an emergency exists, and the controller
     deems it necessary to activate the crash phone. Note: The Tower will check the PCAS
     daily between 0800-0830L. Members are listed as follows: AMOPS, Crash, Hospital,
     and Tower.
  6.2.2. Secondary Crash Net (SCN). The purpose of the base SCN system is to establish a
  communication system for rapid dissemination of information regarding in-flight
  emergencies, aircraft accidents or incidents, and ground emergencies.
     6.2.2.1. The OSS/CC is the SCN manager.
     6.2.2.2. The following agencies are on SCN (all agencies must have 2-way capability
     with a push-to-talk feature): AMOPS, 18MSG/CC, 18WG/SE, 18CES Emergency
     Management, 18OSS Weather, 18WG/CP, 733AMCC, 353d Maintenance Squadron
     (353MXS) MOCC , 18EMS Transient Alert, 18th Security Forces Squadron (18SFS)

     (18FSS/SVRA), 18CES Customer Service, 18CES FES, 18EMS Crash Recovery,
     18WG/MOCC, 18LRS/LGRDDO, 18LRS/LGRF, and 18th Medical Group (18MDG)
     Clinic.
     6.2.2.3. Requests for additions/deletions (excluding those listed in paragraph 6.2.2.2) to
     SCN must be coordinated through the Airfield Manager (AFM) and forwarded to the 18
     OSS/CC for approval/disapproval.
     6.2.2.4. AMOPS is the SCN activation authority and conducts a roll call on the SCN
     system each day between 0800 - 0830L to ensure operational capability. Any station
     failing to respond will receive an immediate phone call to determine reason for a failed
     response.
     6.2.2.5. Individuals who answer the crash net should be familiar with the phonetic
     alphabet and use it when responding with their initials. Individuals answering will
     remain silent until AMOPS has completed the message and conducted roll call. Do not
     hang up until the roll call is complete. Questions may then be asked.
     6.2.2.6. Stations on the SCN are expected to receive and disseminate information in
     minimal time. During actual emergencies use ―Secondary Crash Net Notification
     Checklist‖ to record information in the proper format and sequence.
     6.2.2.7. AMOPS shall relay, verbatim, information received from the Tower.
     6.2.2.8. All agencies on the SCN will have a push-to-talk handset or noise suppression
     feature on their SCN to reduce background noise.

6.3. Emergency Response Procedures.
   6.3.1. Aircrew In-Flight Emergency Procedures.
      6.3.1.1. Advise Naha Approach Control/Kadena Arrival or Tower at the earliest possible
      time of the emergency in the following format:
          6.3.1.1.1. Aircraft Identification and Type.
          6.3.1.1.2. Nature of Emergency.
          6.3.1.1.3. Estimated time until landing; desired runway (left or right, if applicable).
          6.3.1.1.4. Type of Ordnance/Hazardous Cargo. If Cat I or Cat II explosives are
          involved, indicate the exact ordnance by type or munitions and any other data that is
          known.
          6.3.1.1.5. Number of Personnel On-Board (Forward and Aft).
          6.3.1.1.6. Remaining Fuel in Pounds and Time.
          6.3.1.1.7. Present Position.
          6.3.1.1.8. Intention to Engage Arresting System, if applicable.
      6.3.1.2. After landing, if conditions permit, taxi at least 200 feet clear of the runway
      before stopping the aircraft or shutting down engines.
      6.3.1.3. If conditions require the aircraft to be stopped on the runway, notify the ATC
      facility that the aircraft is in contact with well in advance so necessary personnel and
      equipment can be pre-positioned to tow the aircraft off with minimal delay.
   6.3.2. Airfield Operations Emergency Response Procedures for In-Flight and Ground
   Emergencies.
      6.3.2.1. Control Tower shall:
          6.3.2.1.1. When notified of, or upon observing, an emergency condition, Tower will
          activate the PCAS and provide as much of the following information as available and
          applicable. Note: In accordance with FAAO JO 7110.65, minimum required
          information for emergencies includes aircraft identification and type, nature of
          emergency, and pilot’s desires.
          6.3.2.1.1.1. Type of Emergency (In-Flight, Ground, Exercise, etc.). Note: During a
          ground emergency, include the location of the incident specifying the grid map used,
          grid coordinates, and identifying geographical references.
             6.3.2.1.1.2. Aircraft Identification and Type.
             6.3.2.1.1.3. Nature of Emergency.
             6.3.2.1.1.4. Landing Runway and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA).
             6.3.2.1.1.5. Type of Ordnance/Hazardous Cargo. If Cat I, II, or III explosives are
             involved, indicate the exact ordnance by type of munitions and any other data that
             is known.
             6.3.2.1.1.6. Number of Personnel on Board and Location, as appropriate.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                73


            6.3.2.1.1.7. Remaining Fuel in Pounds and Time.
            6.3.2.1.1.8. Present Position.
            6.3.2.1.1.9. Winds.
            6.3.2.1.1.10. Intention to Engage Arresting System, if applicable.
        6.3.2.1.2. Hold airborne/taxiing aircraft, as required, to provide priority landing to
        the aircraft in distress and free access to responding emergency vehicles.
        6.3.2.1.3. If normal runway operations must be suspended for longer than 15
        minutes, Tower will immediately broadcast on 315.8/126.2, 243.0/121.5, 275.8/118.5
        and 280.5/124.2: ―This is Kadena Tower, runway (identifier) closed for (number of)
        minutes (or) indefinitely. ‖
        6.3.2.1.4. Runway Sterilization. All aircraft operations to and from the runway to be
        used by an emergency aircraft will be suspended once the emergency aircraft reaches
        5 miles on final approach for full stop. If, in the controller’s judgment, safety of
        flight for the emergency aircraft would not be affected, sequential aircraft operations
        (multiple ship recoveries, etc.) may continue to the same runway until the emergency
        aircraft reaches 3-miles final for full stop. Airfield Management shall determine
        when operations to the runway used by the emergency may resume, if runway
        operations were suspended.
        6.3.2.1.5. Emergency Warning and Evacuation Alarms. The Tower will activate the
        Emergency Warning and Evacuation Alarm prior to 10-mile final for emergency
        aircraft approaching to land, and for any other condition hazardous to people on the
        ground IAW AFI 13-204V3.
        6.3.2.1.6. Time permitting, the Tower will evacuate all aircraft from the approach
        end ―Hammerheads‖ during recoveries of large/heavy aircraft experiencing flight
        control problems.
     6.3.2.2. Airfield Management Operations shall:
        6.3.2.2.1. Emergency Response/Runway Check. Airfield Management shall activate
        the SCN and respond to all in-flight emergencies/ground emergencies (IFE/GEs). As
        soon as possible, Airfield Management vehicle(s) will be given immediate clearance
        onto the active runway. At that time, runway operations will be suspended until
        released by the Airfield Manager or designated representative.
        6.3.2.2.2. If runway operations must be suspended longer than 15 minutes due to an
        unsafe condition, Airfield Management will consider closing the runway. This
        determination will be based on the situation at hand.
        6.3.2.2.3. When a SOF is on duty in the Tower, he/she may direct that no runway
        check is required or ―SOF-Call‖ due to the nature of the emergency (e.g., emergency
        fuel, cabin depressurization, crewmember or passenger medical emergency,
        environmental control system light, navigational equipment failure, etc.). Tower will
        relay this information to Airfield Management/AMOPS immediately.
        6.3.2.2.4. Airfield Management will respond to all IFEs and standby at the approach
        end of the runway in use unless otherwise deemed necessary. A runway check will

          be conducted prior to resuming runway operations unless a ―SOF-Call‖ is made IAW
          paragraph 8.21. All ―SOF-Calls‖ will be documented in Tower and AMOPS facility
          logs.
          6.3.2.2.5. Airfield Management will check the runway surfaces the aircraft landed
          on, used for roll out, and all taxiways used to get to parking. Airfield Management
          will report any objects found on the runway after an IFE has landed to 18th Wing
          FOD Manager (18 WG/CVF) and 18 WG/SEF. Airfield Management will document
          the IFE check in the AMOPS facility log.
          6.3.2.2.6. Airfield Management will respond to all GEs and determine if a taxiway,
          parking spot, etc., requires closure until the GE has terminated. All GE responses
          will be documented in the AMOPS facility log.
6.4. External Stores Jettison Areas Procedures.
   6.4.1. External Stores/Cargo:
      6.4.1.1. The Primary IFR/Night Jettison Area is in W-176 (TORI SHIMA 26º 36’ 14‖ N
      126º 49’ 53‖ E).
      6.4.1.2. Emergency Jettison: Emergency jettison stores whenever safety dictates. If
      able, jettison at least 1 nm from any land mass and clear of ships. Find jettison point
      using inertial navigation system (INS), TACAN or vectors.
          6.4.1.2.1. Option 1: Jettison hung ordnance within the confines of the weapons
          delivery range, if able.
          6.4.1.2.2. Option 2: If outside the confines of the weapons delivery range, return to
          the weapons delivery range and attempt to jettison.
          6.4.1.2.3. Option 3: If unable to return to the weapons delivery range, jettison
          ordnance beyond 12 nm from land and visually clear the area of surface vessels.
          6.4.1.2.4. Option 4: Jettison westbound on KAD 288 radial at 52 DME (W-176, Tori
          Shima range). Jettison so that stores impact the island, if able. This is the primary
          IFR/night jettison option.
      6.4.1.3. Naha Approach Control may provide radar vectors/flight following to W-173,
      W-174, W-176, and W-178. ATC assistance is limited to vectors to the warning area
      boundary. The pilot remains solely responsible for the release of external stores.
6.5. Fuel Dumping.
   6.5.1. Fuel dumping will be conducted only to reduce aircraft gross weight in an emergency
   or when a JCS priority mission/operational necessity dictates. When circumstances permit,
   fuel will be dumped at least ten miles off shore and as high as practical, but at least 5,000 feet
   MSL.
   6.5.2. Unless an emergency condition dictates otherwise, KC-135/E-3 aircrews will jettison
   fuel between the KAD 120 and 170 radials, from 30-50 DME. Altitude: As high as
   practical, but at least 5,000 feet MSL (recommended altitude above 20,000 feet MSL).
   6.5.3. Advise ATC of intentions, altitude and location prior to commencing fuel dumping
   operations. Advise ATC when fuel dumping is complete.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                  75


   6.5.4. In all non-emergency situations, crews will avoid fuel dumping over land.
6.6. Emergency Aircraft Arresting System Procedures.
   6.6.1. When a pilot elects to make an emergency engagement, Kadena Arrival, Naha
   Approach, and Tower will be advised of the arresting system to be used. The Tower will
   activate the PCAS and relay all pertinent information, including the arresting system to be
   engaged. AMOPS will then activate the SCN and relay all data verbatim. AMOPS will also
   broadcast in-flight emergency (IFE) data on the ramp net.
      6.6.1.1. If feasible, the on-scene commander (Chief-2) will request a fly over of the
      emergency aircraft to get a visual on landing gear and also to allow aircraft in the flight
      pattern to land prior to the emergency aircraft.
   6.6.2. Upon notification from AMOPS of an impending engagement, the Barrier
   Maintenance crew will respond immediately and stand by at the appropriate system, well
   clear of the runway. After each engagement, restoration of the arresting system will be
   accomplished in the following manner:
      6.6.2.1. The aircraft will shut down engines and be removed from the cable by tow
      procedures. ―Sling-Shot‖ procedures are not authorized. The Senior Fire Official is
      designated as on-scene commander. During times that the arrested aircraft’s tail hook is
      immediately clear of cable, and the aircraft is safe to taxi, the on-scene commander may
      instruct the pilot that he/she is free of cable and that he/she may taxi off runway.
   6.6.3. AMOPS will conduct a runway check and report the status prior to resuming normal
   operations.
6.7. Hot Brake Procedures. When it is known or suspected that brakes are overheated, the
aircrew should expect the following:
   6.7.1. Hot Brake Aircraft on Runway or Taxiway:
      6.7.1.1. The Tower, upon notification or suspicion of an aircraft with hot brakes, will
      activate the PCAS and direct the aircraft to a designated Hot Brake Area (Warm-Up Pads
      1-4). Other aircraft or vehicles should proceed via alternate routes to avoid passing
      within 300 feet of the aircraft with actual/suspected hot brakes.
      6.7.1.2. The Senior Fire Official will be designated as the on-scene commander. The
      Fire Emergency Services (FES) will respond to the hot brake aircraft and assume a
      surveillance position not closer than 300 feet, unless the on-scene commander determines
      a fire is imminent. FES personnel will provide fire coverage for Aircraft Recovery
      personnel as they approach the aircraft to assess for hot brakes.
      6.7.1.3. Aircraft Recovery will dispatch the Crash Recovery Crew. The Crash Recovery
      Supervisor with coordination with the on-scene commander (Chief 2) will do the
      following:
          6.7.1.3.1. Verify the Hot Brake Condition. Caution: Approach hot brakes from front
          or rear only.
          6.7.1.3.2. Advise the on-scene commander and Airfield Management of the actions
          required.
 76                                                       KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


      6.7.1.4. Engines will not be shut down until a signal is received from the Aircraft
      Recovery Supervisor after coordination with the on-scene commander, unless the aircraft
      is already in a designated hot brake area.
   6.7.2. Hot Brake Aircraft Detected in the Parking Area:
      6.7.2.1. If engines are running, the aircraft will advise Tower and taxi to the nearest clear
      area and stop. If the aircraft is parked in the upper fighter ramp, advise Tower and taxi to
      clear area adjacent to Spot 50.
      6.7.2.2. If engines are shut down, all non-essential personnel will evacuate at least 300
      feet. Aircraft within 300 feet will be removed if possible.
      6.7.2.3. Only the on-scene commander can terminate a hot brake emergency. Note:
      Brakes normally attain peak temperatures 15 to 30 minutes after braking action occurs.
      Taxiing the aircraft in an attempt to cool the brakes with airflow can cause additional heat
      buildup. Taxi only as necessary to reach a clear area.
6.8. Abandonment of Aircraft.
   6.8.1. Repair and Reclamation (Aircraft Recovery) is responsible for removing
   crashed/disabled aircraft obstructing the use of the runway. Partner units are responsible for
   assisting in the recovery of their aircraft. Aircraft Recovery personnel will be organized to
   respond immediately on a 24-hour basis.
   6.8.2. When a disabled or crashed aircraft obstructs the runway, Tower will transmit all
   pertinent information over the PCAS.
   6.8.3. AMOPS will activate the SCN and pass Tower’s information verbatim.
   6.8.4. Aircraft Recovery crew will report to the on-scene commander.
   6.8.5. The on-scene commander will establish an entry control point IAW 18 WG Operation
   Instruction 31-101 and as the on-scene commander will take charge of the rescue and
   recovery operations.
   6.8.6. Removing the disabled or crashed aircraft is the responsibility of the Aircraft
   Recovery Team. Unless specifically requested to advise and assist, all other personnel will
   remain well clear of the area, regardless of aircraft assignment. The partner commander will
   report to the on-scene commander. Partner maintenance representatives will report to the
   entry control point to assist Aircraft Recovery.
   6.8.7. Crashed aircraft and associated debris will not be disturbed until after the alert
   photographer has taken pictures and the aircraft has been released by 18 WG/SE Wing
   Safety. Fuels Quality Control and Inspection personnel must be cleared for entry to obtain a
   required fuel sample as soon as possible.
   6.8.8. Airfield Management will coordinate all activities for repair and clearing of airfield
   facilities affected by disabled and crashed aircraft.
   6.8.9. Only Airfield Management can authorize a runway to be reopened for operational use
   subsequent to closure caused by a disabled or damaged aircraft.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                  77


   6.8.10. Controlled Bailout Area: Ie Shima Range (KAD R-008/22). Abandon aircraft on a
   northwesterly heading so that the parachute landing is on Ie Shima Range. Recommended
   altitude is 2,000-3,000 feet MSL.
6.9. Personnel/Crash Locator Beacon Signal/Emergency Locator Transmitter Response
Procedures.
   6.9.1. Each flying organization, along with Kadena AMOPS, is responsible for monitoring
   flying activities to assure accountability of aircraft. Directing the SAR effort is the
   responsibility of the 18 WG/CP. 18 WG flying organizations may be called upon to augment
   host nation airborne search effort at the request of the 18 WG/CP. In the event of an off base
   incident, follow procedures outlined in USFJI 10-200, Off Base US Military Aircraft
   Accidents in Japan.
      6.9.1.1. Daytime F-15 flying requires any rescue support be available (33 RQS, Japan
      Air Self Defense Force [JASDF], or the Japanese Coast Guard). Night F-15 flying
      requires 33 RQS rescue support, unless waived by 18 OG/CC. Normally, the JASDF
      Southwestern Division Headquarters will be the primary rescue contact during daytime
      18th Wing local flying.
   6.9.2. AMOPS Procedures.
      6.9.2.1. When aircraft exceed their ETA by 30 minutes, AMOPS will conduct a
      preliminary communications check through the following agencies:

Table 6.1. Overdue Aircraft Checklist
                1       Kadena Tower
                2       Naha Approach Control

                8       Base of Departure (If Applicable)
      6.9.2.2. Each agency is allowed 30 minutes from time of contact to report its findings
      back to AMOPS.
      6.9.2.3. If the aircraft is not located within 1 hour of ETA AMOPS will contact the 18
      WG/CP with all pertinent information.
   6.9.3. Emergency Locator Transmitter Procedures.
      6.9.3.1. Any base agency aware of an Emergency Locater Transmitter (ELT)
      transmission will notify AMOPS immediately.
      6.9.3.2. AMOPS will:
          6.9.3.2.1. Notify Naha FSS, 18 CS/SCO (Installation Spectrum Manager), Naha
          ACC, Futenma Tower, 18 WG/CP, 733 AMCC, Kadena Transient Alert, 67 FS Life
          Support, 44 FS Life Support, 33 RQS, AFE, Aero Club, MWLK, and deployed units
 78                                                       KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


           of the ELT heard at Kadena. Request status update from each agency no later than 1
           hour after notification.
           6.9.3.2.2. Request Installation spectrum manager to search for ELT and notify
           AMOPS of their findings every hour until the ELT is terminated. If ELT continues
           past 12 hours, AMOPS will again notify the agencies in paragraph 6.2.2.2 AMOPS
           will notify all agencies of signal termination.
       6.9.3.3. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) and egress will notify AMOPS of their
       findings every two hours until the ELT is terminated. AFE and egress will locate and
       silence ELT used in life saving devices (survival kits/vest, parachutes) that broadcast on
       the 243.0 frequency. Note: AFE and egress do not have the ability to locate ELT
       broadcasting on 121.5 or 406 frequencies.            AFE and egress do not maintain
       beacons/locators (crash beacons) installed in aircraft. The organizations responsible for
       aircraft maintenance, to include Aero Club, should be contacted in the event of an ELT
       actuation. Operational ground testing of ELT has been authorized during the first five
       minutes of each hour. To avoid confusing the tests with an actual ELT, the testing is
       restricted to no more than three audio sweeps.
6.10. Hung Ordnance Procedures. Note: ATC will question non 18 WG aircraft to determine
if the ordnance is safe or unsafe. After the determination is made, the applicable procedure will
be followed.
   6.10.1. Ordnance Explosive Types:
       6.10.1.1. Live. Ordnance containing actual wartime explosive charges.
       6.10.1.2. Practice. Ordnance containing small explosive charges designed for ease of
       scoring.
       6.10.1.3. Inert. Ordnance without explosive charge.
       6.10.1.4. Unexpended Ordnance. Live, practice or inert armament attached to an aircraft
       for which no attempt was made to fire, launch or jettison.
       6.10.1.5. Hung Ordnance. Live, practice or inert armament that failed to depart the
       aircraft when an attempt to fire, launch or jettison was made. Note: It is the aircrew’s
       responsibility to inform ATC if ordnance is secure (safe) or unsecured (unsafe).
           6.10.1.5.1. Hung Secure or Safe. A release attempt was made, but there is no
           indication that the release mechanism activated. Switches are de-armed and safe
           indications are observed in the cockpit. Note: Unless otherwise requested by the
           pilot, this condition does not warrant emergency procedures.
           6.10.1.5.2. Hung Unsecured or Unsafe. Some portion of the release mechanism
           activated or an unsafe indication is observed in the cockpit. Examples: A bomb with
           one release lug released, or a rocket or missile which has moved in its tube or on its
           launcher.
   6.10.2. Live Armament Departures and Recoveries. Runway 23L/R will be used for
   departures with live bombs unless aircraft characteristics dictate otherwise. Runway 05L/R
   will be used for recoveries with live bombs unless aircraft characteristics dictate otherwise.

   6.10.3. Aircrew will comply with AFI 11-2F-15 Vol. 3 for landing with hung ordnance.
   Landings will normally be from a straight-in approach while minimizing flight over land.
   6.10.4. The Tower will activate the PCAS for hung unsecure or unsafe ordnance
   emergencies. AMOPS will activate the SCN .
   6.10.5. Aircrew Procedures after Landing with Hung Ordnance:
       6.10.5.1. After landing, aircraft will taxi to the end of the runway then to Run-Up Pads 1,
       2, 3 or 4 or as directed by Tower for de-arming. Observe published de-arm headings if
       forward firing ordnance is involved.
       6.10.5.2. Aircraft will not proceed from the de-arming area until safing is complete.
       6.10.5.3. If arresting systems are used, ordnance will be put in safe before the aircraft is
       removed from the cable.
6.11. Wind Limitations on Control Tower
   6.11.1. The Tower shall evacuate when wind gusts in excess of 50 knots are present and will
   close when TCCOR-1C is declared, unless otherwise directed by the CCLTR or AOF/CC.

     6.12.5.3. AMOPS Personnel will:
        6.12.5.3.1. If time permits, activate the SCN prior to evacuating and notify all
        agencies that AMOPS is evacuating to building #3413. If time does not permit,
        notify 18th WG Command Post and request they activate the SCN and notify other
        agencies.
        6.12.5.3.2. Notify Command Post, FES, Tower, GCA, Naha Flight Service Station,
        the NCOIC Airfield Management Operations and Airfield Manager of evacuation.
        6.12.5.3.3. Secure all classified material in a locked safe.
 82                                                      KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


          6.12.5.3.4. Suspend runway operations.
          6.12.5.3.5. Review and update the Evacuation Kit at least quarterly.
   6.12.6. Kadena Arrival Evacuation Procedures: Because of the geographical separation
   between the Arrival facility and Kadena AB, evacuation to Building 3413 will only occur as
   a contingency plan if ATC service cannot be restored in a reasonable amount of time.
   Determination to evacuate Kadena Arrival will be made by the Air Traffic Manager. Aircraft
   can expect anywhere from 1 to 2 hours of interruption to Arrival service.
      6.12.6.1. The necessary equipment for Kadena Arrival to provide contingency ATC
      service and ensure flight safety consist of as a minimum; one STARS TDW, landline
      communications capability to Naha Area Control Center, Naha Tower, Kadena Tower,
      Futenma Tower, and Futenma GCA. Kadena Arrival should operate on its normal
      common frequencies (255.8/135.9), have access to normal discrete frequencies, the
      capability to monitor/broadcast on VHF/UHF emergency frequencies (121.5/243.0), and
      have access to UHF/VHF multichannel radios. Recording equipment (if capability
      exists) shall record as a minimum the primary Arrival/Emergency frequencies.
      6.12.6.2. When directed by the Air Traffic Manager to return to the primary facility, the
      next scheduled crew will report to the Naha facility. Once the primary facility is ready,
      the Kadena contingency facility will hand off all functions to the Naha primary facility.
6.13. Other Emergency Procedures.
   6.13.1. Hot/Jammed Gun Procedures.
      6.13.1.1. Runway 05. Aircraft Weapons Maintenance personnel will attempt to safe and
      clear the jammed gun at Warm-Up Pad 3. If the gun cannot be made safe and cleared, the
      aircraft will be shut down and towed to Hardstand 125. If aircraft is to be held as an
      exhibit for gun rapid response team IAW AFI 21-101 (determined by Wing Weapons
      Manager and 18th Maintenance Group Commander [18 MXG/CC]), aircraft may be
      placed in a PAS provided hangar doors remain closed until system is safe.
      6.13.1.2. Runway 23. Aircraft Weapons Maintenance personnel will attempt to safe the
      gun at the parking spot on Warm-Up Pad 4. If the gun cannot be made safe, the aircraft
      will be shut down at that spot and towed to Hardstand 125. If aircraft is to be held as an
      exhibit for gun rapid response team IAW 21-101 (determined by Wing Weapons
      Manager and 18 MXG/CC), aircraft may be placed in a PAS provided hangar doors
      remain closed until system is safe.
      6.13.1.3. Helicopter Procedures. Helicopters returning to Kadena AB with a weapon that
      cannot be made safe will inform the Tower and request landing on Runway 05L/23R for
      taxi to Warm-Up Pad 1. The weapon will be aimed IAW Table 2.7 until aircraft
      maintenance personnel can remove the weapon from the aircraft.
   6.13.2. Use of Single Frequency Approach (SFA) Emergency Discrete Frequency.
      6.13.2.1. To standardize and optimize communications during an IFE, the following
      procedures apply:
          6.13.2.1.1. Under normal circumstances, the pilot of the IFE aircraft will notify the
          SOF as soon as possible.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                              83


        6.13.2.1.2. Naha Approach Control will direct the IFE aircraft to the SFA
        (290.3/Channel 18 is the normal frequency/channel). The SOF will also notify
        Kadena Arrival (via hotline) and Tower watch supervisors if an aircraft other than an
        IFE will be using the SFA.
        6.13.2.1.3. Once the IFE aircraft is on the SFA, the pilot will relay the initial
        information regarding the IFE to both the SOF and ATC. Pilot will then initiate
        communications with ATC for recovery sequence and to ensure traffic separation.
        6.13.2.1.4. After ATC instructions are complete, and approval is obtained from ATC
        for transmissions on the SFA, the SOF and the IFE pilot will conduct
        communications as necessary to safely recover the aircraft.
     6.13.2.2. If the IFE occurs after the aircraft is under ATC control, the pilot will not
     depart the ATC frequency for the SFA without notifying the controlling agency.
     However, the initial IFE coordination for fighter aircraft should still occur on the SFA
     rather than on the ATC frequency.
     6.13.2.3. Responsibilities.
        6.13.2.3.1. Pilot will adhere to AFI 11-2F-15 Vol.3 (or applicable airframe and/or
        Service directives) for emergency procedures.
        6.13.2.3.2. SOF:
            6.13.2.3.2.1. Notify Tower, Naha Approach, and Kadena Arrival watch
            supervisors immediately when the SFA will be used.
            6.13.2.3.2.2. Pass emergency information to the Tower watch supervisor.
            6.13.2.3.2.3. Transmit only information for the IFE on the SFA.           Do not
            simulcast communications that do not pertain to the IFE on the SFA.
            6.13.2.3.2.4. Shall not issue ATC instructions.
            6.13.2.3.2.5. Provide Naha Approach, Kadena Arrival and Tower watch
            supervisors with any non-standard sequencing plan. For example, during single
            runway operations, the SOF may hold an IFE aircraft planning a barrier
            engagement to recover other low fuel aircraft. (ATC will assume immediate
            priority for the IFE unless told otherwise.)
        6.13.2.3.3. Tower Watch Supervisor:
            6.13.2.3.3.1. Serve as focal point for all coordination between the SOF and tower
            controllers.
            6.13.2.3.3.2. Relay information between the Naha Approach, Kadena Arrival and
            GCA watch supervisors and the SOF when the hotlines are unusable.
            6.13.2.3.3.3. Monitor the SFA at all times.
            6.13.2.3.3.4. Do not simulcast impertinent information to the IFE on SFA.
        6.13.2.3.4. Naha Approach and Kadena Arrival:
            6.13.2.3.4.1. Provide an additional frequency to the SOF when the SFA is already
            in use and an additional IFE aircraft needs to recover using SFA procedures.
 84                                                         KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


              6.13.2.3.4.2. Monitor the SFA at all times.
              6.13.2.3.4.3. Do not simulcast impertinent information to the IFE on the SFA.
       6.13.2.4. The unpredictable nature of in-flight emergencies may prevent strict adherence
       to the above procedures. However, the intent is to conduct the bulk of the
       communication associated with an IFE on the SFA. Additionally, common sense must be
       used to prioritize information flow and actions necessary to accomplish the bottom line:
       SAFE RECOVERY OF THE IFE.
   6.13.3. KC-135 Emergency Air Refueling Procedures.
       6.13.3.1. The 18 WG/CP will notify AMOPS of an impending launch.
          6.13.3.1.1. The tanker aircrew or mission coordinator will deliver the flight plan to
          AMOPS as quickly as possible. Consider using the facsimile machine. If a flight
          plan is faxed, units will verify receipt and resolve discrepancies via telephone
          confirmation at 634-3118.
          6.13.3.1.2. Unless otherwise coordinated, emergency air refueling communications
          plan will be HABU 3: 286.4/primary, 306.4/secondary, 255.6/back-up, APN 69 3-1-
          1. AWACS shall make initial radio contact on 233.1.
   6.13.4. Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft. Base response procedures are contained in KADENA
   ABI 31-101.
6.14. Alternate Facility Procedures.
   6.14.1. Alternate Control Tower Limiting Factors (LIMFACS). The following LIMFACs
   affect ATC operations when alternate tower procedures are in effect:
       6.14.1.1. During the initial period of evacuation and activation of the alternate facility,
       ATC operations at Kadena shall be suspended and the airfield will be closed.
       Resumption of limited operations should begin in 30 minutes or less.
       6.14.1.2. UHF/VHF Radio Capability.
          6.14.1.2.1. Availability. The alternate tower can operate on its normal tower
          (315.8/126.2) and ground control frequencies (275.8/118.5), as well as VHF/UHF
          emergency frequencies (121.5/243.0). Additionally, the alternate tower has 315.8 B/U
          and 126.2 B/U capability along with 1 UHF and 1 VHF multichannel radio (shared
          with the GCA).
       6.14.1.3. ATIS will not be available.
       6.14.1.4. Land Mobile Radio (LMR) FM Communications. The alternate tower has
       permanent FM-1 capability via the GCA ETVS and FM-2 capability is available via the
       Motorola console.
       6.14.1.5. Airfield Lighting Controls. No lighting controls are contained in the alternate
       facility. Tower personnel set lights appropriately upon evacuation for current/forecasted
       weather conditions and time of day/night. Subsequent lighting adjustments are controlled
       by lighting personnel following their arrival at the vault.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                85


     6.14.1.6. Radar Traffic Information/Advisories/Spacing. No radar display exists in the
     alternate facility. Controllers cannot provide radar-assisted arrival/departure/wake
     turbulence separation, traffic advisories, or sequencing and/or spacing.
     6.14.1.7. Visibility blind spots are covered in Para 2.1.4.2
     6.14.1.8. Coordination Limitations. The numerous coordination procedures Tower
     normally provides will decrease due to equipment limitations. Flying organizations and
     other agencies on or near the flight line must be more aware of:
         6.14.1.8.1. Aircraft Anti-Hijacking.
         6.14.1.8.2. Aircraft engine maintenance runs and aircraft tows.
         6.14.1.8.3. Traffic Flow and Pattern Operations.
         6.14.1.8.4. Flow of air traffic and vehicle access shall be suspended from the time
         controller personnel evacuate the primary tower until operations are resumed in the
         alternate facility.
         6.14.1.8.5. The Tower’s traffic pattern workload (total VFR and IFR) may be further
         reduced at the watch supervisor's discretion.
         6.14.1.8.6. Traffic pattern operations may be started/continued at the sole discretion
         of the tower watch supervisor based on existing weather, time of day, pending
         arrivals, pending departures, and types of aircraft involved.
     6.14.1.9. Reduced runway separation minima between separate flights shall be no less
     than 6,000 feet between all applicable aircraft
     6.14.1.10. Tower Evacuation Exercises.           EET members shall coordinate tower
     evacuation exercises with the Airfield Operations Flight Commander and Tower CCTLR
     at least 48 hours in advance. This coordination will outline guidance and impact of tower
     evacuation exercises on real-world operations, exercises, delays or holding of
     transient/contract aircraft not involved in the operational readiness inspection (ORI)/EET
     scenario. In all cases, safety shall not be compromised.
  6.14.2. GCA Alternate Facility Operations LIMFACS. In the event the GCA requires
  evacuation, a rated controller will relocate to the tower and resume the Clearance Delivery
  function as quickly as possible. The following limitations will exist:
     6.14.2.1. ASR and PAR approaches will be unavailable.
     6.14.2.2. No Single Frequency Approaches (except for 290.3 SFA frequency).
     6.14.2.3. Radar monitoring and flight following are not provided.
     6.14.2.4. Practice approaches may be limited.
     6.14.2.5. Expect IFR clearance delays.
  6.14.3. AMOPS Alternate Facility Operations.
     6.14.3.1. AMOPS personnel will setup as quickly as possible in the AMOPS alternate
     location, the 18 OSS/OSA conference room in building #3413.
     6.14.3.2. The following LIMFACS will occur:
86                                                       KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


     6.14.3.2.1. There will be longer airfield response times because AMOPS is further away
     from the airfield.
     6.14.3.2.2. There could be delays in processing information to and from AMOPS due to
     the number change.
     6.14.3.2.3. The alternate location does not have a fax machine, so any faxed flight plans
     will either be delayed in input if a runner is available and can go back to the main counter
     to retrieve them or not able to be sent at all depending on whether or not access to the
     building is available.
     6.14.3.2.4. BASH response will either be delayed or nonexistent with the pyrotechnics
     still locked in their primary location depending on whether or not access to the building is
     available.
     6.14.3.3. AMOPS Personnel will:
        6.14.3.3.1. Activate SCN conference call by dialing 632-9381. Notify all agencies
        that AMOPS has arrived at the alternate location, building #3413.
        6.14.3.3.2. When directed to return to primary facility, an individual will be sent
        ahead to open the facility and ensure AMOPS functions can be carried out at primary
        location. Once the primary facility is ready, the remaining AMOPS personnel will
        relocate to building #3409.

                           FLIGHT PLANNING PROCEDURES

7.1. Flight Plan Procedures.
   7.1.1. A flight plan is mandatory for all aircraft arriving and departing Kadena AB, except in
   the case of an emergency, or else otherwise coordinated in an LOP.
      7.1.1.1. Arriving aircraft without a flight plan shall contact AMOPS, as soon as possible,
      on frequency 266.0 or 131.4 for coordination. AMOPS will coordinate with TA and
      AMC to determine the status and parking location of the aircraft and will advise the
      Tower. In the event of an emergency, if coordination has not been completed prior to the
      aircraft’s actual landing, the aircraft will be held on Taxiway Bravo between the runways
      or on Taxiway Delta between Taxiway Lima and Runway 05L/23R and SFS will be
      notified. If the aircraft is carrying hazardous cargo, the aircraft will be held and
      instructed to not shut down engines until its final parking location has been determined.
      AMOPS will notify Flight Safety (18 WG/SEF). If an emergency is not declared and an
      aircraft attempts to land regardless, ATC will withhold a landing clearance and will
      notify AMOPS who will notify SFS and all parties will follow procedures outlined in the
      KABI 31-101.
      7.1.1.2. Any aircraft requesting to depart without a flight plan on file shall contact
      AMOPS on frequency 266.0 or 131.4 for coordination. Aircraft shall not be allowed to
      taxi until Tower receives a flight plan from AMOPS. Exceptions: The Air Evac Alert
      KC-135 aircraft will be authorized to taxi for departure without a flight plan. The Navy
      ―Echo Item‖ P-3 aircraft will be authorized to taxi for departure without a flight plan only
      when AMOPS calls Tower via the direct line and states the aircraft is an Echo Item. The
      flight plan must be on file prior to departure. 18 WG aircraft may taxi with supervisor of
      flying (SOF) approval; however, aircraft shall not be allowed to depart until a flight plan
      has been entered into the system.
   7.1.2. Tactical. To support ATC abbreviated clearance procedures, pilots flying a tactical
   flight plan (VFR) shall file a radar departure.
   7.1.3. Flight plans will be filed no sooner than 24 hours prior to departure and not less than 1
   hour before departure. Flight plan proposals originating from Kadena AB with a route of
   flight in the local area shall be submitted in one of the following forms: DD Form 1801,
   DoD International Flight Plan; AF Form 4327, ARMS Fighter Flight Authorization, or Unit
   Flying Schedule.
      7.1.3.1. DD Form 1801 and AF Form 4327 Procedures. All aircrew flying out of
      Kadena AB may file flight plans in person with AMOPS. Original flight plans may not be
      accepted via radio. Flight plans can be amended via any means provided an original flight
      plan is on file at AMOPS.
          7.1.3.1.1. 18 WG units and 353 SOG must file flight plans via fax or email. Each
          flying unit shall maintain the original flight plan IAW Service directives.
          7.1.3.1.2. USAF rotational units, MWLK and U.S. Navy (USN) rotational units may
          file flight plans via fax or email as follows: Upon arrival, the unit shall coordinate
88                                                      KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


         flight plan requirements with the Airfield Manager and confirm understanding of all
         requirements in paragraph 7.1 and all subparagraphs. This will negate the need for a
         separate Letter of Agreement. Each flying unit shall maintain the original flight
         proposal IAW Service directives. A confirmation call must be made to AMOPS to
         verify receipt of faxed or emailed flight proposals. Note: Rotational units that have
         not coordinated with the Airfield Manager are not authorized to fax or email flight
         proposals.
     7.1.3.2. 18 WG units and 353 SOG Flying Schedule Procedures. 18 WG units and 353
     SOG may file flight plans via the Unit Flying Schedule in person, by fax, or by email.
     Schedules must contain the following items:
         7.1.3.2.1. Number and Type of Aircraft.
         7.1.3.2.2. Call Sign(s).
         7.1.3.2.3. Estimated Time of Departure.
         7.1.3.2.4. Total Estimated Elapsed Time. As per Naha ACC request, aircraft filing
         for a terminal delay at Kadena will include mission timing plus terminal delay timing
         in block 16, TOTAL estimated elapsed time. Additionally, aircrews will annotate
         block 18, OTHER INFORMATION, with a remark stating estimated terminal delay
         timing, e.g., RMK/KAD: TRANS 3+00.
         7.1.3.2.5. Pilot’s Name.
         7.1.3.2.6. Fuel.
         7.1.3.2.7. Area of Flight (Warning Areas).
         7.1.3.2.8. Approval Authority.
         7.1.3.2.9. Local Contact Number. Note: A confirmation call must be made to
         AMOPS to verify receipt of faxed or emailed flight proposals. If the flight proposal
         is faxed or emailed, the submitting organization must maintain the original on file
         IAW Service directives.
     7.1.3.3. Kadena Partner/Rotational Unit Flying Schedule Procedures. USAF rotational
     units, MWLK and USN partner units may file flight plans via the Unit Flying Schedule in
     person, by fax, or by email as follows: Upon arrival, the unit shall coordinate flight plan
     requirements with AMOPS and confirm understanding of all unit requirements in
     paragraph 7.1 and subparagraphs. This will negate the need for a separate Letter of
     Agreement. Each flying unit shall maintain the original on file IAW Service directives.
     A confirmation call must be made to AMOPS to verify receipt of faxed or emailed Unit
     Flying Schedule. All information requirements in paragraph 7.1.3.2 and subparagraphs
     must be met. Note: Rotational units that have not coordinated with the Airfield Manager
     are not authorized to fax or email Unit Flying Schedules.
  7.1.4. Units using the AF Form 4327 will deliver, fax or email the signed copy of the form to
  AMOPS by the end of the duty day before the effective date. Flying squadrons shall
  immediately call, fax, or email all updates and add-ons to AMOPS and 18 WG/CP. Emails
  shall be followed up with a phone call. All items in paragraph 7.1.3.2 must be provided for
  each change.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                              89


     7.1.4.1. Units using TASAMS will ensure the next day’s flying schedule is approved and
     in TASAMS by the end of the duty day (1630L, or 1930L during 18 Wing night flying)
     before the effective date. Once the flying schedule is in TASAMS, after 1630L/1930L, it
     is considered approved by the appropriate flying squadron commander or director of
     operations. This approval allows AMOPS to file flight plans with Naha Flight Service
     Station and ensures flight plans are entered into the airspace system. All changes after
     1630L/1930L for the schedule/current day of flying must be telephonically coordinated
     with AMOPS as an add-on, change or deletion.
     7.1.4.2. Units will provide AMOPS with a flight plan/scheduling point of contact list
     whenever it changes. The list will include individual(s) unit, name, rank, and duty and
     home telephone numbers.
  7.1.5. During local exercises, aircraft on alert must activate their clearance with AMOPS
  prior to launch.
     7.1.5.1. Shogun Control/Shogun 10 (SOF) or designated representative will initiate a
     flight clearance request via telephone or by radio with AMOPS for alert aircraft only. A
     flight plan shall be faxed, emailed or hand delivered to AMOPS as soon as possible.

8.4. Prior Permission Required (PPR) Procedures. A valid AMOPS-issued PPR number is
required for all transient aircraft (except AMC, Air Evac, Special Air Missions, and DV-6)
desiring to terminate in a full stop landing at Kadena Air Base. Permanent party and TDY/TAD
personnel on Kadena AB do not require a PPR number; however, these aircrews will know and
strictly comply with all noise abatement restrictions.
   8.4.1. Procedures.
       8.4.1.1. Prior to issuing a PPR number or accepting an aircraft’s flight plan, AMOPS will
       check standard noise restriction criteria and any additional noise restriction NOTAMs to
       determine if 18 OG/CC approval is required. If 18 OG/CC approval is required, AMOPS
       will instruct the requester to call 18 WG/CP. Note: The 18 OG/CC waiver does not
       constitute a PPR number. Coordination with Transient Alert for Air Force, Army, and
       Navy aircraft and MWLK for Marine aircraft is required prior to the issuance of a PPR
       number.
       8.4.1.2. If the quiet hours waiver is approved, 18 WG/CP will notify AMOPS for PPR
       coordination with Transient Alert or MWLK.
       8.4.1.3. If the PPR is approved, AMOPS will notify 18 WG/CP. 18 WG/CP will notify
       requester and base agencies per the after-hour checklist.
       8.4.1.4. 18 WG/CP will instruct requester to call AMOPS for the PPR number.
       8.4.1.5. If the quiet hours waiver is approved, but the PPR is denied, AMOPS will notify
       18 WG/CP. Command post will notify requester of disapproval.
       8.4.1.6. If the quiet hour waiver is disapproved, 18 WG/CP will notify requester and base
       agencies per the after-hour checklist.
8.5. Air-Evac Notification and Response Procedures. AMOPS will notify Tower, 18
WG/CP, 733 AMCC, Transient Alert, and Customs of all Air-Evac inbounds and arrivals.
   8.5.1. Rescue Protection for Aeromedical Airlift Aircraft. Tower shall notify Crash Control
   when an aero medical airlift aircraft is 15 nm from the airfield.
8.6. Unscheduled/Unauthorized Aircraft Arrivals. In the event of an unscheduled aircraft
arrival, AMOPS will initiate actions contained in AFI 10-1001. Additionally, all applicable
work centers will initiate actions in KABI 31-101, Installation Security Support Plan, a copy of
which can be obtained from 18 SFS. For civil aircraft diverts, AMOPS will notify 18 WG/CP to
stand up the Kadena Reception Working Group. For military PPR violations, AMOPS will run a
QRC and forward the information to the AOF/CC.
8.7. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Notification Requirements. Airfield Management will notify
Naha Approach of the call sign and type of the DV aircraft. Naha Approach will call Airfield
Management via the hotline when the aircraft is 50 miles from the airfield. Note: Airfield
Management is the only 18 WG agency authorized to request 50-mile-out calls from
GCA/Tower/Kadena Arrival/Naha Approach.
8.8. Dangerous/Hazardous Cargo. 733 AMS shall notify Airfield Management of aircraft
arriving/departing with Hazardous Cargo classified as ―Class 6‖ (Poison), all explosive classes,
and Nuclear Weapon Related Materiel. For non-AMC aircraft, Airfield Management shall
obtain hazardous cargo information when the PPR is requested.

   130V3, MC-130 Operations Procedures.
      8.9.1.1. Scheduling and Notification. NVD operations are approved and scheduled
      during weekly Wing scheduling meetings. NOTAMs are published for operations that
      require other than normal airfield lighting configurations or restrictions to keep
      nonparticipants away from participating aircraft. Operations that require other than
      normal airfield lighting configurations
      8.9.1.2. Procedures.
          8.9.1.2.1. Weather/lunar Requirements.
              8.9.1.2.1.1. The minimum in flight visibility for NVG contour operations is 3SM.
              Higher minimum visibility may be required to identify and clear obstacles. Note:
              Lack of sufficient illumination may prevent NVG contour operations in otherwise
              VMC conditions.
              8.9.1.2.1.2. Any training or operational missions planned when the lunar
              illumination is forecast to be less than 10 percent during the mission will require
              an additional level of ORM.
              8.9.1.2.1.3. The SOG will be made aware of the ORM assessment and risk
              mitigation conducted for missions planned to be flown in low illumination
              conditions.
          8.9.1.2.2. Aircraft will contact Naha Approach or Kadena Arrival prior to entering
          the Naha PCA and request own-navigation to final. Once established on final, report
          field in sight for visual Straight-In, Base Turn, Simultaneous, or Minimum Interval
          Landing (as applicable). Thereafter, all landings will be conducted via downwind,
          base turn, or visual straight-in. Note: Aircraft returning VFR operating outside the
          Naha PCA will contact Tower prior to Bolo Point (Runway 05L/R) or Moon Beach
          (Runway 23L/R) with intentions.
          8.9.1.2.3. Non-participating aircraft will not mix with participating NVD aircraft in
          any traffic pattern or any controlled area.
          8.9.1.2.4. Naha Approach or Kadena Arrival will, upon initial contact, inform Tower
          of the type of operation requested.
          8.9.1.2.5. Tower will control subsequent visual patterns and coordinate any
          additional straight-in approaches with Naha Approach or Kadena Arrival.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                               95


        8.9.1.2.6. Aircraft will use one of five options: touch and go, low approach, stop and
        go (dependent on BAK-12 barriers), or land and taxi back. Note: 180 degree turns
        are not authorized on the asphalt portion of runway 05L/23R.
        8.9.1.2.7. NVD operations will use Runway 05L/23R unless otherwise directed by
        ATC. In the event of nearby traffic that does not affect NVD operations, the MC-130
        pilots will be requested to turn on their overt lights in order to ensure aircraft
        separation.
     8.9.1.3. Aircraft Responsibilities:
        8.9.1.3.1. Conduct NVD operations at their own risk.
        8.9.1.3.2. Provide position reports when requested.
        8.9.1.3.3. Operate aircraft lighting as specified in Air Force Special Operations
        Command (AFSOC) operating instructions and approved AFSOC aircrew waivers.
        8.9.1.3.4. Advise Tower after full stop landing/termination of NVD operations when
        runway lights may be illuminated.
        8.9.1.3.5. Upon exiting the runway and for taxi backs aircraft will use overt lights
        and normal taxi procedures.
     8.9.1.4. Naha Approach or Kadena Arrival Responsibilities:
        8.9.1.4.1. Advise Tower as soon as possible of aircraft intentions.
        8.9.1.4.2. Provide vectors or own-navigation to visual final.
     8.9.1.5. Tower Responsibilities:
        8.9.1.5.1. When requested by the pilot, turn off all runway and approach lights, and
        switch runway lights to non-landing runway. During Alternate Tower operations,
        NVD operations cannot be conducted due to the inability to make lighting changes.
        8.9.1.5.2. Inform participating aircraft prior to turning on runway or approach lights
        (upon completion or cancellation of NVD operation, or as deemed necessary by the
        tower watch supervisor). Aircrews will advise Tower after termination of NVD
        operations when runway lights may be illuminated.
        8.9.1.5.3. Advise aircraft of barrier status prior to first landing.
        8.9.1.5.4. Advise non-participating aircraft of NVD operations.
        8.9.1.5.5. Suspend NVD operations if necessary for safety (See paragraph 8.9.1.5.2.).
        In the event NVD operations are suspended/terminated, participating aircraft will fly
        runway heading, maintain 1,300 feet MSL until the departure end of the runway and
        enter the VFR rectangular pattern or turn cross wind and proceed to and hold at Bolo
        Point (5L/R) or moon Beach (23L/R) until all non-participating aircraft have departed
        or landed and taxied off the runway.
        8.9.1.5.6. Coordinate with Naha Approach or Kadena Arrival for subsequent straight-
        in approaches that will extend outside the Tower Class D.
        8.9.1.5.7. Tower is NOT required to visually ensure the aircraft’s gear is down.

          8.9.1.5.8. Issue only "LANDING WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK" clearances due
          to inability to properly scan runway for obstacles.
          8.9.1.5.9. Tower will operate airfield lighting IAW FAAO JO 7110.65, Air Traffic
          Control Chapter 3, section 4 Airport Lighting. Lighting will be set to the appropriate
          level requested by the pilot, when able.
          8.9.1.5.10. Control Tower Lighting. Light levels within the control tower do not
          affect NVD operations. Controllers do not use NVDs in the control tower.
       8.9.1.6. Vehicle Operations. All participating vehicles will remain within the vicinity of
       taxiway Alpha, with their lights pointed away from the cockpit of participating aircraft,
       and a NOTAM will be issued closing the area. Non-participating vehicles will be kept
       out of the NOTAM-closed area to the maximum extent possible.
          8.9.1.6.1. Normal vehicle operations (runway checks) are authorized on Runway
          05R/23L. These operations will not interfere with NVD operations.
       8.9.1.7. Helicopter Night VFR Operations. Helicopter crews may conduct night VFR
       operations from any designated helipad using night vision goggles. A landing and/or
       departure clearance will not be issued when operating to/from all helipads on the airfield
       during the hours of darkness, as Kadena’s helipads are not lighted IAW USAF and FAA
       standards.    Instead, the following phraseology will be used, ―PROCEED AS
       REQUESTED, USE CAUTION (reason and additional instructions, as necessary).‖ This
       practice is also applicable to Night Vision Goggle (NVG) operations to/from the
       helipads.
8.10. Aircraft Priorities. ATC services are provided on a first-come, first served basis as
circumstances permit, with the exception of the operational priorities listed in FAAO JO
7110.65. The priorities for Kadena AB are set in the following order:

   NAUTICAL MILE UNTIL LEAVING NINER HUNDRED.‖ Note: Climb gradient is
   required to ensure obstacle clearance.
   8.12.4. Based on traffic, the controller may issue alternate instructions. In such cases, the
   controller will specifically issue complete instructions.
   8.12.5. For base-assigned aircraft, controllers will issue ―Execute STANDARD RADAR
   climb-out‖ to reduce excess verbiage. Note: Standard Radar Climb-out will also be
   used/issued when aircraft initially depart into the local IFR radar pattern.
8.13. Opposite Direction Take-Offs and Landings.
   8.13.1. All opposite direction traffic will be approved or disapproved based solely on known
   traffic. Except for specific military missions, opposite direction traffic will not normally be
   given priority.
   8.13.2. IFR opposite direction operations require approval from Tower, Kadena Arrival, and
   Naha Approach Control.
       8.13.2.1. IFR/IFR opposite direction procedures shall be used only when Naha ASR is
       operational.
       8.13.2.2. Minima:
          8.13.2.2.1. IFR Opposite Direction Departure vs. IFR Arrival. An opposite direction
          departure/low approach aircraft must be airborne and turning to avoid conflict prior to
          an arriving aircraft reaching 15 flying miles from the runway.
          8.13.2.2.2. IFR Opposite Direction Arrival vs. IFR Departure/Low Approach. An
          opposite direction arriving aircraft shall be no closer than 15 flying miles from the
          runway prior to the departing aircraft becoming airborne and turning to avoid
          conflict.

          miles to the runway.
8.14. Breakout/ Go-Around/Missed Approach Procedures.
   8.14.1. ―BREAKOUT‖ is an instruction used to direct aircraft out of the approach stream. It
   means that an aircraft may no longer continue its approach due to an imminent situation (e.g.,
   overtaking another aircraft on final, conflicting IFR/VFR traffic, etc.) and must be turned.
      8.14.1.1. An aircraft that is issued ―BREAKOUT‖ instructions prior to entering Class D
      airspace shall be turned to avoid entering Class D airspace. Note: Tower will coordinate
      with Kadena Arrival or Naha Approach for direction of turns for arriving aircraft outside
      Class D airspace.
      8.14.1.2. Breakouts within Class D airspace will only be issued as a last resort to avoid a
      conflict.
          8.14.1.2.1. Runway 05- ―BREAKOUT, TURN LEFT HEADING 360, CLIMB AND
          MAINTAIN 2,000’ IMMEDIATELY, (reason for breakout), ACKNOWLEDGE.‖
          8.14.1.2.2. Runway 23- ―BREAKOUT, TURN RIGHT HEADING 360, CLIMB
          AND      MAINTAIN      2,000’ IMMEDIATELY,  (reason for breakout),
          ACKNOWLEDGE.‖
      8.14.1.3. Breakout to the south is not authorized due to the proximity of Naha and the
      Futenma Class D Surface Area.
   8.14.2. ―GO-AROUND‖ is an instruction for a pilot to abandon the approach to landing due
   to an imminent situation (e.g., prior landing aircraft on runway, vehicle on runway, etc.). A
   pilot on an IFR flight plan making an instrument approach should execute the published
   missed approach procedure or proceed as instructed by ATC. The following are standard
   ―GO-AROUND‖ procedures for Kadena AB.
      8.14.2.1. Runway 05- ―GO AROUND (Reason). FLY RUNWAY HEADING, CROSS
      DEPARTURE END AT OR BELOW 1,300’, THEN CLIMBING LEFT TURN
      HEADING 360 WITHIN 2 DME, MAINTAIN 3,000’.‖
      8.14.2.2. Runway 23- ―GO AROUND (Reason). FLY RUNWAY HEADING, CROSS
      DEPARTURE END AT OR BELOW 1,300’, THEN CLIMBING RIGHT TURN

       HEADING 360 WITHIN 2 DME, MAINTAIN 3,000’.‖ Note: Delay in climb and turn
       may result in conflict with arriving aircraft to Naha Runway 18.
   8.14.3. Missed Approach. In the event of missed approach or if the pilot loses visual
   references during the maneuver, aircraft inbound to Runway 05L/23R will execute standard
   radar climb out. Aircraft inbound to Runway 05R/23L will fly runway heading, cross
   departure end of runway at or below 1,300’, climb and maintain 3,000’ and contact approach
   control.
8.15. Civil Aircraft Operations. Civil aircraft desiring to operate at Kadena Air Base must
comply with procedures in AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits; AFI 10-1002,
Agreements for Civil Aircraft Use of Air Force Airfields; AFI 10-1003, Use of Air Force
Installations for Non-Government Business by Civil Air Carriers Participating in the Civil
Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) Program; and AFI 10-1801 Foreign Governmental Aircraft Landings
at United States Air Force Installations as applicable.
8.16. Civil Use of Military ATCALS. Civil aircraft may be issued radar vectors and permitted
to use USAF NAVAIDs for practice and multiple low approaches at Kadena as long as such
approaches do not delay mission-essential traffic. ATC supervisory personnel make the
determination to permit or deny these operations based on current and projected traffic
conditions. Civil aircraft must have a landing permit or approval from the installation
commander to land.
8.17. Aero Club Operations.
   8.17.1. Ground Operations. Aero Club aircraft will confine ground operations to the
   southeast side of the airfield, unless prior coordination is made with Airfield Management.

      8.17.3.2. Aero Club aircraft will fly rectangular traffic patterns; 360º overhead patterns
      are not authorized.
      8.17.3.3. The downwind for all patterns is located not more than 1 nm from the runway.
      8.17.3.4. After takeoff, turn crosswind leg after climbing above 400 feet MSL and
      continue climb to 800 feet MSL on crosswind leg, unless otherwise specified by Tower.
         8.17.3.4.1. If departing the traffic pattern, depart to the initial point on the VFR
         departure route to be used. Tower will direct Aero Club aircraft departing the traffic
         pattern to ―CONTACT NAHA APPROACH CONTROL,‖ or to ―CONTACT
         FUTENMA TOWER,‖ depending on the aircraft’s destination.
         8.17.3.4.2. For closed patterns, the downwind lateral spacing and altitude are the
         same as the rectangular pattern. Note: Multiple VFR/IFR approaches or straight-in
         approaches to Kadena AB will be based on controller workload when 18 WG aircraft
         are in the local patterns.
  8.17.4. VFR Aero Club Arrival/Departure Routes.
      8.17.4.1. Aero Club aircraft will use the following routes to enter/depart Class D
      airspace. The altitudes on the routes are for daytime VFR operations. Any deviations
      from the published arrival/departure routes must be approved by the controlling ATC
      agency. For nighttime VFR operations, altitudes will be assigned by Naha Approach
      Control (See Figure A2.17).

         clearance due to inability to properly scan runway for obstacles.
  8.23.2. Forward Area Refueling Point Operations. FARP involves hot refueling from one
  aircraft (tanker) to another (receiver) with engines running. Aircraft and vehicles involved in
  the operations are completely blacked out. Operations will not be conducted if lightning is
  within 5 miles or high winds present a hazardous condition. Prior to commencing and at the
  conclusion of FARP operations, the 353 OSS/SOCC shall notify Airfield Management
  Operations, 18 SFS, FES, 733 AMCC and 18 WG/MOCC for all maintenance units.
  Additionally, the crews conducting FARP shall maintain vigilance of the FARP area and call
  ―knock-it-off‖ if the perimeter is breached by non-participating vehicle operators.
      8.23.2.1. The primary FARP location is on Warm-Up Pad 1. The 353 OSS/A3 will
      coordinate FARP training at the weekly 18 OG/CC scheduling meeting.

      fax/email) the Airfield Manager and Tower Chief Controller of the date(s) and time(s) of
      the FARP training.
      8.23.2.3. The Airfield Manager will have AMOPS issue a NOTAM closing Taxiway
      Alpha at Warm-Up Pad 1 and Runway 05L/23R. This provides participating aircraft the
      necessary escape routing from the FARP site in case of emergency.
  8.23.3. Static FARP Training. Static FARP training involves a single static (engines not
  running) C-130 aircraft that pressurizes its FARP cart hoses outside of the aircraft. Aircraft
  involved in the operations are completely blacked out. Prior to commencing and at the
  conclusion of FARP operations, the 353 OSS/SOCC shall notify Airfield Management
  Operations, 18 SFS, FES, 733 AMCC and 18 WG/MOCC for all maintenance units.
  Additionally, the crews conducting FARP shall maintain vigilance of the FARP area and call
  ―knock-it-off‖ if the perimeter is breached. Note: If more than one aircraft and/or vehicle
  are transferring fuel, the operations are NOT Static FARP Training and FARP rules from
  paragraph 8.23.2. apply.
      8.23.3.1. The primary static FARP training location is on Warm-Up Pad 1. The 353
      OSS/A3 will coordinate FARP training at the weekly 18 OG/CC scheduling meeting.
      8.23.3.2. After obtaining 18 OG/CC approval, the 353 OSS/A3 will notify in writing (via

      Taxiway or operations on Runway 05L/23R.
      8.23.3.5. FES will be notified that static FARP training is occurring, but are not required
      to be on-scene.
  8.23.4. Silent Launch and Recovery Procedures.
      8.23.4.1. Coordination: All silent launches will be coordinated with Airfield
      Management, Tower, and Naha Approach or Kadena Arrival using the procedures
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                109


     outlined in paragraph 5.3.4 of this instruction at least 24 hours before scheduled launch
     time, unless precluded by security considerations, but not later than 2 hours prior.
     8.23.4.2. Departure: Departure Control will address the aircraft by its 4-digit Beacon
     code. Once airborne, acknowledge all radio transmissions from Naha Approach Control
     with an ―IDENT‖ on assigned Beacon code.
        8.23.4.2.1. Departures will file ADDAN as the clearance limit. Upon reaching
        ADDAN, the aircraft’s IFR clearance will automatically be cancelled and the pilot
        shall resume normal communications procedures.
        8.23.4.2.2. VFR departures shall file or fly either the IKEI or SESOKO
        DEPARTURE. At IKEI/SESOKO, descend to low level and remain clear of Naha
        PCA.
     8.23.4.3. Silent Arrivals:
        8.23.4.3.1. The mission timing sheet will include the ETA at the KAD 320R/045
        DME (plus/minus 15 minutes).
        8.23.4.3.2. Silent arrivals are only authorized outside of quiet hours and will only be
        flown during periods when Naha Approach Control radar is operational. The 18
        OG/CC is the approval authority for any silent arrival ops during quiet hours. These
        requests will be made via the weekly OG/CC scheduling meeting. All arrivals will
        adhere their coordinated time on the timing sheet, plus or minus five minutes. Any
        aircraft not able to meet scheduled timing must use normal radio procedures for taxi.
        8.23.4.3.3. Weather minimums for arrival phase of flight will be 3,000’ ceiling and 5
        SM visibility. If weather is below minimums, the aircraft will remain VFR and
        contact approach for IFR clearance.
        8.23.4.3.4. Arrivals will track inbound on the KAD 320/045 DME at 4,000’
        squawking a pre-determined Mode 3 code. Approach control will radar identify
        aircraft using the assigned code and give current weather and runway in use in the
        blind, aircraft will acknowledge radar identification with an IDENT. If aircraft is not
        radar identified prior to Naha PCA (30 DME), aircraft will remain clear of Naha PCA
        and contact Naha Approach for non-radar routing or clearance to enter Naha PCA for
        a VFR recovery.
        8.23.4.3.5. VFR arrivals shall file the radial/DME of the points via which they will
        enter Naha PCA. Provide Naha Approach or Kadena Arrival with the time the
        aircraft will arrive over these points. If the aircraft is more than 30 seconds from the
        planned time, notify Naha Approach or Kadena Arrival. Maintain at or below 500
        feet. When arriving Runway 23, climb to 1300 feet when feet dry. If a blacked out
        landing is planned and coordinated with tower, the runway lights will be turned off
        two minutes prior to the planned arrival time. Once the turn to final is made, aircraft
        shall monitor both approach and tower frequencies until touchdown. At 5 miles,
        aircraft will be issued winds in excess of 10 knots and a ―wheels down‖ check.
        Tower will give the aircraft a steady green light for landing clearance unless the
        aircraft contacts tower for entry into the VFR pattern, or contacts approach control for
        radar vectors to the runway in use.
 110                                                     KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012


          8.23.4.3.6. After landing, aircraft shall exit the runway as soon as practical and
          observe the tower for a      flashing green light (approval to taxi). Aircraft will
          acknowledge taxi instructions by flashing landing lights.
       8.23.4.4. Radio Failure.
          8.23.4.4.1. Departures will follow lost communications procedures outlined in
          paragraph 8.11 of this instruction.
          8.23.4.4.2. Arrivals will proceed inbound to KAD 320/020 and enter a standard
          holding pattern at 4,000’. After completing two turns in holding, the aircraft shall
          then proceed inbound on a 15 DME arc to the final approach course for the TACAN
          approach to Runway 05R/23L. Aircraft will maintain 4,000 feet MSL until
          established on the inbound radial. Monitor Tower for a steady green light (clearance
          to land).
   8.23.5. Self-Contained Approaches (SCA) Procedures.
       8.23.5.1. These approaches are conducted under VFR flight rules (flight plan) and
       although the approach begins outside of the Kadena Class Delta Airspace, the aircraft do
       not penetrate the Naha PCA. The only difference between the MC-130P (JAKAL) and
       MC-130H (GOOSE) SCAs is the timing from Bolo Point (BP) (circa 45 seconds) to the
       landing threshold.
       8.23.5.2. The SCA Runway 05 will commence at Bolo Point (BP). Aircraft will be at
       500’ (unless a different altitude is approved by ATC) from Bolo inbound at
       210KIAS/230KIAS. Aircraft will fly a course of 195-200 degrees until the depicted
       slowdown point. At Slowdown; the aircraft will go flight idle and turn left to intercept
       the final course. Upon rollout, the aircraft will be 120-140KIAS—finessing the airspeed
       to hit a predetermined time (to the second) at the threshold. The ground track for each
       aircraft and route to the particular runway is depicted on Figures A2.20. thru A2.22
       Note: The main focus for the pilots is to hit threshold down to the second that is pre-
       determined in preflight planning.
       8.23.5.3. The SCA 23 will commence at Moon Beach. Aircraft will be at 1000 MSL at
       Moon Beach slowing from 210KIAS/230KIAS to 140KIAS. Aircraft will turn right to
       intercept the final course. Upon rollout, the aircraft will be 120-140KIAS—finessing the
       airspeed to hit a predetermined time (to the second) at the threshold. The ground track
       for each aircraft and route to the particular runway is depicted on Figure A2.22.
8.24. Remote Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Operations Procedures. Kadena is a divert location for
the Global Hawk (GH), (RQ-4). There are no base assigned RPA platforms.
   8.24.1. Emergency Divert. The following actions are taken:
       8.24.1.1. The GH Operations Center (GHOC) will make telephone notification to the
       Kadena Arrival Controller in Charge providing the aircraft callsign, location, intended
       route of flight, and ETA.
       8.24.1.2. Upon divert notification, the Kadena Arrival Controller in Charge will provide
       current airfield status and update the GHOC with changes in Airfield Status as required.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                 111


      8.24.1.3. Unless the GHOC directs otherwise, the GH will fly a Self-Contained Global
      Positioning System Approach, shut engine off at the Initial Approach Fix, land and stop
      on the runway, and contact Tower via phone.
      8.24.1.4. Due to radiation hazards, Ground Personnel should remain well clear of the
      aircraft (50 foot perimeter) anytime the engine is operating, unless cleared by the GHOC.
      However, there is not radiation hazard if the engine is out.
      8.24.1.5. Ground handling needs are very similar to other aircraft. Tow procedures are
      outlined in the GH Aircraft Recovery Procedures document.
      8.24.1.6. GH is a PL3 asset. The sensor payload is classified. The GH survey team has
      concluded that there is not suitable hangar space to shelter this platform. The GH will be
      parked in the designated PL2 restricted area parking location and protected IAW Kadena
      Air Base Installation Security Instruction 31-101.     .
      8.24.1.7. GH is an unmanned asset, do not risk rescue crews safety if the asset is on fire.
      The GH carries up to 17,000 lbs of JP-8. There are no other hazardous chemicals or
      propellants.
      8.24.1.8. Tower will lower the BAK-14 barriers or have Barrier Maintenance remove the
      BAK-12 barriers prior to RPA arrivals, departures, and taxi on the runway.
      8.24.1.9. All RPA departures will normally take place from the duty runway. Any
      special requests such as departures from a intersection or taxiway may be approved at the
      discretion of the local controller, based upon the runway in use and known traffic.
   8.24.2. NORDO. In addition to the procedures outlined above the following actions are
   taken:
      8.24.2.1. The GH will squawk 7700.
      8.24.2.2. The GH will utilize a 5.25 degree glideslope along the approach path.
      8.24.2.3. In crosswind conditions, the GH may deviate from the centerline during rollout
      due to inoperable noise wheel steering.
      8.24.2.4. The aircraft will have to be towed clear of the runway.
      8.24.2.5. All communications between the GH and ATC will be via telephone.
8.25. AV-8 Operations at Kadena AB.
   8.25.1. Responsibilities. AV-8 units operating at Kadena will comply with the spirit and
   intent of 18 WG directives governing ground and flight operations except as follows:
      8.25.1.1. VTOL will only be accomplished utilizing the VTOL pad located on Taxiway
      Charlie (See Figure A2.4).
      8.25.1.2. AV-8 arming and de-arming (live munitions) will be conducted on Taxiway
      Delta between Taxiway Lima and Runway 05L/23R. On Taxiway Delta, the arm and/or
      de-arming heading will be 225 degrees.
      8.25.1.3. Weather minima for press-up operations will be at least 800 foot ceiling and 1
      mile visibility.

      8.25.1.4. Approaches to and departures from the VTOL pad will normally be conducted
      over Runway 05R/23L.
      8.25.1.5. The pilot will advise Tower and request clearance to enter or exit the lateral
      boundaries of the runway airspace if crosswinds dictate an approach or departure that
      might violate the boundaries.
      8.25.1.6. Under certain emergency conditions requiring a conventional landing, the AV-
      8 pilot may request the doughnuts supporting the arresting gear be moved to allow the
      cable to lie flat under tension at least 50 feet either side of the runway centerline.
      8.25.1.7. When crosswinds exceed 10 knots, AV-8s may require a landing on the VTOL
      pad. If the weather is below 1,700/3, a qualified LSS must be available to assist AV-8
      VTOL pad landings, or flight operations will be terminated.
  8.25.2. Restrictions.
      8.25.2.1. An AV-8 is restricted from crossing over a supported arresting cable at speeds
      exceeding 5 knots. If the cable is lying flat (unsupported) and tensioned, the AV-8 may
      cross at any speed.
      8.25.2.2. VFR go-arounds may be flown gear down.
      8.25.2.3. AV-8s will fly normal traffic patterns as depicted in Chapter 3. Maintain
      pattern altitude until turning base. When Runways 05L/R are in use, extend inside
      downwind until feet wet. Perform water checks, if necessary, feet wet. Avoid angling
      final, fly at least a 1 mile final, and be aligned with the runway centerline prior to
      becoming feet dry. Use minimum practical power settings, commensurate with flight
      safety, until feet wet.
      8.25.2.4. VTOL will only be accomplished utilizing the VTOL pad located on Taxiway
      Charlie.
      8.25.2.5. When operations are conducted to/from the VTOL pad, operations on Runway
      05R/23L shall be limited as if the AV-8 was utilizing the runway itself.
      8.25.2.6. When an arriving aircraft is established in a hover to land on the VTOL pad, or
      when press-up operations are being conducted, vehicle and aircraft taxi operations may
      be conducted anywhere along Runway 05R/23L but will be restricted to a wingspan 200
      feet or less between Taxiways Bravo and Delta. If the AV-8 requests to depart during a
      press-up maneuver, paragraph 8.26.2.5. applies. Other arrival and/or departure
      operations on Runway 05R/23L are prohibited during AV-8 press-up operations.
      8.25.2.7. South trim pad use is restricted to properly identified spots only. 100% engine
      runs are authorized for fighter type aircraft. AV-8 aircraft may use no greater than 10
      degrees of exhaust deflection. Strict adherence to this restriction is critical, as trim pad
      spots are limited and AV-8 aircraft using greater than 10 degrees exhaust deflection will
      damage the pavement and render spots permanently unusable.
      8.25.2.8. Due to noise abatement requirements VTOL pad operations are only permitted
      for emergencies, functional aircraft checks, or if needed due to excessive crosswinds.
      8.25.2.9. Other restrictions as directed by 18 OG/CC will apply.
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                  113


8.26. Ground Operation of E-3 Surveillance Radar.
   8.26.1. Hazards. Radiation from the E-3 surveillance radar has the potential to injure
   exposed personnel, detonate electro-explosive devices (e.g., firing of ejection seats, jettison
   fuel tanks), ignite flammable liquids, and affect ―fly-by-wire‖ controlled aircraft. When
   ground operation of the E-3 aircraft surveillance radar is in progress, a radar hazard zone
   (Live Fire Zone) extends upward from the aircraft at an angle of approximately 22 degrees
   and approximately 15 degrees either side of the centerline of the main beam out to a distance
   of 1,300 feet.
   8.26.2. Location of Operating Area. At Kadena AB, the E-3 aircraft will only be positioned
   in the north corner of Warm-Up Pad 2, with its nose facing the runway. The rotodome will
   be positioned with its radar antenna facing forward and parallel to the wings. The rotodome
   will aim the main radar beam toward Echo helipad, which creates a ―Live Fire‖ zone 15
   degrees either side of the main beam and between Taxiway Lima and Runway 05L/23R.
   Aircraft and/or personnel may not transit this area prior to termination of ―Live Fire‖
   operations.
   8.26.3. 18 WG/MOCC will notify the agencies listed in Table 8.3 at least 8 hours prior to
   the commencement of scheduled ground operations.
   8.26.4. Airfield Management will notify Tower, 18 WG/CP, MWLK, Navy Ops, and 733
   AMCC by issuing a NOTAM.

8.27. Radar Warning Receiver/Identification Friend or Foe (RWR/IFF) Check
Responsibilities. 18 WG/MOCC will notify Airfield Management of scheduled RWR/IFF
checks and locations. AMOPS will issue a NOTAM and impose restrictions for aircraft, if
required. Upon completion of the checks, the unit will inform 18 WG/MOCC when all
equipment and personnel are cleared from the area and the taxiways are cleared. 18 WG/MOCC
will then notify AMOPS to cancel the related NOTAM, if published. All equipment shall be
removed immediately once RWR/IFF checks are complete.
8.28. C-17/C-130 Backup Procedures. When a C-17/C-130 needs to back up off of a
hardstand or from a parking spot, spotters must be positioned on the taxiway to control the flow
of vehicles. Vehicles will not be allowed to pass the area until the aircraft is ready to taxi. A
clearance distance of 200 feet must be maintained behind aircraft engines.
8.29. Airfield Construction Procedures. This section establishes responsibilities and
procedures for construction on the airfield. All Kadena AB units involved with construction on

the airfield shall follow guidance in Unified Facilities Criteria 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport
Planning and Design.
   8.29.1. Organizations will coordinate all exterior work requirements with the Airfield
   Manager before painting any paved surface or installing any fixed or mobile obstacles on the
   airfield.
       8.29.1.1. An obstacle is anything posing a threat to aircraft operations (e.g., fire bottles,
       maintenance stands, vehicles, Airfield Ground Equipment (AGE), construction sites,
       etc.).
       8.29.1.2. When not directly supporting aircraft, obstacles must remain at least 1,000 feet
       from runway centerlines, 200 feet from taxiway centerlines, and 125 feet from the edge
       of aprons.
       8.29.1.3. Equipment may be pre-staged on parking aprons or hardstands no earlier than
       one hour prior to the arrival of the aircraft it will support. It must be removed
       immediately after the aircraft departs the parking apron or hardstand and stored in a safe
       designated location that meets the criteria listed in Para 8.30.1.2.
   8.29.2. All work requests involving exterior projects on the airfield will be coordinated
   through 18 OSS/OSAM and 18 WG/SE before submission to Base Civil Engineers. All
   work requests involving projects inside USAF restricted areas, or affecting USAF restricted
   area boundaries, will be coordinated through 18 SFS/S3O Operations Officer. The Base
   Civil Engineer will not accept such work requests if proper coordination has not been
   accomplished.
   8.29.3. For work done by contractors, a pre-construction meeting will be held at least 30
   days in advance of the construction start date.
   8.29.4. Explanation of Terms.
       8.29.4.1. Joint Review. The meeting conducted before a contract is let for bid. For
       airfield projects, agenda items will include a review of project design, special contract
       provisions, possible phasing of construction to reduce impact on military operations,
       contractor access to the construction site, and other special problems which may be
       encountered.
       8.29.4.2. Preconstruction Meeting. The contractor and all affected agencies will meet to
       review the project before the start of construction. The contract will be reviewed at this
       time to ensure all parties are aware of the terms and special provisions.
       8.29.4.3. Controlled Area. The airfield, in general, is designated a controlled area.
       Contractors will have base passes over-stamped ―CONTRACTOR‖ and will have copies
       of personnel listings available at the job site for verification purposes. Persons without
       verifiable flight line authorization may be escorted by anyone who does have such
       authorization.
       8.29.4.4. Restricted Areas. Contractors will be escorted into and out of restricted areas
       by the USAF agency most closely associated with the project IAW 18 WGI 31-101.
       8.29.4.5. Free Zone. An area temporarily established inside a restricted area isolating it
       from the rest of the restricted area. Free zones are designed to facilitate the movement of
KADENAABI13-204 19 JUNE 2012                                                                115


     contractor personnel and equipment within the construction area while maintaining
     required security standards. Free zones will be delineated by an elevated boundary,
     normally provided by the contractor, and consist of red rope tied to stanchions or fencing.
     Free zones on taxiways should be held to a minimum, and will normally not be
     authorized unless required for contract completion (e.g., taxiway repair). The free zone
     boundary will be constantly surveyed by the USAF agency most closely associated with
     the work project. The USAF agency most closely associated with the work project, in
     concert with the Contracting Officer, will submit a request for the free zone to the
     Contracting Officer Representative (CRO). The COR will process requests to the
     Integrated Defense Council for approval. Coordination with Airfield Management must
     be accomplished. 18 SFS/S3O will provide the technical guidance to ensure security
     requirements are met. KABI 31-101 provides more detailed information on free zone
     establishment, coordination, and physical security requirements.
     8.29.4.6. Escorts. For security PL 3 restricted areas, persons having the appropriate open
     number on their restricted area badge may escort contractor personnel within that
     restricted area. Formal escort official authorization is required for Priority A and B
     restricted areas. Escorts and escort officials for contractors working within restricted
     areas will be coordinated by the 718 Civil Engineering Squadron, Project Management
     Section (718 CES/CEPM). The organization or agency most closely associated with the
     work project has primary responsibility for providing escorts. Airfield Management is
     the Control Area Manager for the entire flight line area and does not provide escort
     services. See KABI 31-101 for additional information on escort requirements and visitor
     briefings.
     8.29.4.7. Haul Route. Route or path designated to be used by construction or repair
     personnel and equipment during the course of a project. This route will be determined by
     the Airfield Manager and the organization having operational control over the area. Haul
     routes will be included in free zone requests. Tentative haul routes will be discussed at
     the joint review meeting, with the final determination made by the Airfield Manager at
     the pre-construction meeting.
     8.29.4.8. Flight Line Driver’s License. Written authority issued by Airfield Management
     to operate a vehicle on the Kadena flight line IAW KABI 13-213.
     8.29.4.9. Contractor Vehicle Flight Line Passes. Written authority issued by Airfield
     Management on a case-by-case basis IAW KABI 13-213.

Terms
Joint Review— The meeting conducted before a solicitation is issued. For airfield projects,
agenda items will include a review of project design, special contract provisions, possible
phasing of construction to reduce impact on military operations, contractor access to the
construction site, and other special problems which may be encountered.
Preconstruction Meeting— The contractor and all affected agencies will meet to review the
project before the start of construction. The contract will be reviewed at this time to ensure all
parties are aware of the terms and special provisions.
Controlled Area— The airfield, in general, is designated a controlled area. Contractors will
have base passes over-stamped ―CONTRACTOR‖ and will have copies of personnel listings
available at the job site for verification purposes. Persons without verifiable flight line
authorization may be escorted by anyone who does have such authorization.
Restricted Areas— Contractors will be escorted into and out of restricted areas by the USAF
agency most closely associated with the project IAW KADENAABI 31-101.
Free Zone— An area temporarily established inside a restricted area isolating it from the rest of
the restricted area. Free zones are designed to facilitate the movement of contractor personnel
and equipment within the construction area while maintaining required security standards. Free
zones will be delineated by an elevated boundary, normally provided by the contractor, and
consist of red rope tied to stanchions or fencing. Free zones on taxiways should be held to a
minimum, and will normally not be authorized unless required for contract completion (e.g.,
taxiway repair). The free zone boundary will be constantly surveyed by the USAF agency most
closely associated with the work project. The USAF agency most closely associated with the
work project, in concert with the Contracting Officer, will submit a request for the free zone to
the technical representative of the contracting officer (COR). The COR will process requests to
the Integrated Defense Council for approval. Coordination with Airfield Management must be
accomplished. 18 SFS/S3O will provide the technical guidance to ensure security requirements
are met. KADENAABI 31-101 provides more detailed information on free zone establishment,
coordination, and physical security requirements.
Escorts— For security PL 3 restricted areas, persons having the appropriate open number on
their restricted area badge may escort contractor personnel within that restricted area. Formal
escort official authorization is required for Priority A and B restricted areas. Escorts and escort
officials for contractors working within restricted areas will be coordinated by the 718 Civil
Engineering Squadron, Project Management Section (718 CES/CEPM). The organization or
agency most closely associated with the work project has primary responsibility for providing
escorts. Airfield Management is the Control Area Manager for the entire flight line area and
does not provide escort services. See KABI 31-101 for additional information on escort
requirements and visitor briefings.
Haul Route— Route or path designated to be used by construction or repair personnel and
equipment during the course of a project. This route will be determined by the Airfield Manager
and the organization having operational control over the area. Haul routes will be included in
free zone requests. Tentative haul routes will be discussed at the joint review meeting, with the
final determination made by the Airfield Manager at the pre-construction meeting.

Flight Line Driver’s License— Written authority issued by Airfield Management to operate a
vehicle on the Kadena flight line IAW KABI13-213.
Contractor Vehicle Flight Line Passes— Written authority issued by Airfield Management on
a case-by-case basis IAW KABI 13-213.
