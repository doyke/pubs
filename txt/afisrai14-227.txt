This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 14-2, Intelligence Rules and
Procedures. The Crew Manning Letter (CML) is an integral part to planning, organizing,
directing and allocating resources within Squadrons, Groups and Wings. It outlines the type and
number of personnel required to support Planning and Direction, Collection Processing and
Exploitation, Analysis and Production, and Dissemination (PCPAD) for a given mission in order
to meet validated tasking in a particular mission area. Therefore, it is important to standardize a
process to develop, adjust and authorize crew composition as required. This instruction
establishes and describes procedures and responsibilities to support proper manning of the
various platform systems supported within the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA) and by other AF organizations employing AFISRA (0U-
coded) personnel. It outlines procedures for creating, maintaining and submitting CMLs to
higher headquarters. It is used in conjunction with weapons system instructions, MAJCOM
supplements, NSA Directives and the Movements Requirements Letter (MRL) tables. If local
circumstances require, Squadrons and Groups will supplement this instruction as outlined in AFI
33-360, Publications and Forms Management. This publication applies to all Downlink SIGINT
Collection Platform (DSCP), Airborne SIGINT Reconnaissance Program (ASRP) and all
associated GEOINT-tasked units and personnel. This also applies to AFISRA attached/gained
Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units and personnel.

Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route

        maintained on a system with no lower than a SECRET COLLATERAL classification
        level. (T-1A)
AFISRAI14-227 18 February 2014                                                               3

      Wing, to AFISRA/A3G within 30 days of any changes/updates to mission position
      manning or no later than 31 January annually if no changes are required. (T-2A)

      2.4.4. Mission area or track designator.
      2.4.5. Orbit segments, if tasking is by orbit segments.
   2.5. Units executing DSCP/ASRP missions will identify their required crew mix on the
   CML. This will include all crew positions and Go/No Go positions. For DSCP missions,
   core and distributed operations positions will be included and identified. Also include Air
   Force Specialty Code (AFSC), unless waived, or service equivalent, qualifications, and
   language specialty by Resource Language Activity (RLA) for all cryptologic operator (CO)
   positions. (T-1A)
      2.5.1. CMLs will list required crew positions--any deviation requires waiver action in
      accordance with Paragraph 3. Mission activities conducted with less than an optimum
      crew require an analysis of operational risk and must be monitored and trended by the
      waiver approval authority. (T-1A)
      2.5.2. Each CML will clearly identify full crew complement and Go/No Go position
      manning requirements for each applicable platform and mission type. Unit/CCs, or their
      designated mission lead, will maintain authority to tailor a crew from optimum levels,
      ensuring all mission requirements are met. (T-1A)
3. Waivers.
   3.1. Waiver Process. A waiver is required prior to executing any mission with less than full
   Go/No Go position manning. Approval authority for all CML waivers is the Unit/CC. For
   expeditionary operations, the deployed Unit/CC will sign CML waivers. Waivers will be
   submitted through each unit’s chain of command. Waivers should be coordinated as early as
4                                                           AFISRAI14-227 18 February 2014


    possible. Once approved, units will forward copies of all waivers through applicable
    command channels to AFISRA/A3G within three working days. (T-1A)
       3.1.1. For units without a parent Group or Wing, waiver authority is AFISRA/A3G.
       3.1.2. At a minimum, waiver requests must include the following: (T-1A)
           3.1.2.1. Crew position.
           3.1.2.2. Justification for waiver.
           3.1.2.3. Period of waiver.
           3.1.2.4. Unit plan of action to remedy the situation.
           3.1.2.5. Expected mission impact.
    3.2. Waiver Renewal. Submit a waiver request for each mission until such time as the
    position shortage is remedied or the CML is amended and the requirement is eliminated. (T-
    1A)
    3.3. Go/No Go. Go/No Go crew positions are required to meet governing USSIDs or
    mission tasking, must be manned at all times and can only be waived under proper authority
    in order to successfully accomplish the mission. Waiver authority for operational crew
    composition will be the Group/CC or O-6 with Group/CC authority for expeditionary
    operations. For DCGS units, waivers for Go/No Go crew positions will be coordinated
    through each unit’s parent Wing for approval. AFISRA/A3G will be notified of all crew
    complement waivers. (T-0A)
    3.4. Crew Definitions.
       3.4.1. Go/No Go positions – Go/No Go positions are positions that are required to be
       manned to comply with applicable USSIDs or mission tasking. Absence of a
       crewmember in a Go/No Go position raises operational risk beyond acceptable level.
       Go/No-Go position requirements will be identified on CMLs with an asterisk.
       3.4.2. Optimum Crew – full crew composition required to maximize the collection
       capabilities of the tasked platform.
