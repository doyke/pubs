SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
instruction adds the aircraft availability metric and deletes the requirement to report data
integrity information. It provides additional guidance on preparing the senior leader’s
comments, analysis comments and driver information. Clarifies the logistics standards review
process. Adds the requirement to identify repeat and recur discrepancies in the abort and break
rate tables. Standardizes reporting format for all indicators and provides an expanded example
of hangar queen reporting.

1. Objective. The objective of the Monthly Logistics Indicators Report (MLIR) is to evaluate
performance in an effort to improve efficiency and effectiveness. An essential element for this
evaluation is the metrics contained in the MLIR. The metrics are a tool for gauging where focus
needs to be directed. The result of compliance with this instruction should be the accurate
AETCI21-105 18 MARCH 2013                                                                       3


portrayal of unit performance and the identification of areas which may require improvement or
further investigation as well as identification of support problems beyond the scope of the unit.
   1.1. Each unit must emphasize the continual, in-depth analysis of aircraft maintenance
   processes, the integrity of aircraft maintenance documentation methods, timeliness in
   reporting, and comprehensive remarks describing particular unit support issues requiring
   further analysis and action.
   1.2. The role of the headquarters is to assess how well the unit is meeting mission
   requirements, improving equipment performance, identifying emerging support problems,
   and projecting current trends. Maintenance performance is assessed through evaluation of
   MLIR data and comments provided by senior leaders, maintenance personnel and unit level
   maintenance analysts.
2. Applicability. All AETC units possessing or supporting aircraft will report their data as
specified in this instruction, unless they are specifically exempted. Units which possess more
than one mission design series (MDS) aircraft will list them separately; however, separate reports
are not required.
3. Responsibility. Wing, maintenance group (MXG or equivalent), and unit commanders are
responsible for compliance. Each wing commander or designated representative will ensure all
reports cited in this instruction are prepared and transmitted as prescribed. The preparing agency
and office of primary responsibility (OPR) is the Maintenance Management Analysis (MMA)
Section or equivalent in civil service/contractor activities based on organizational alignment.
Commanders will review the accuracy of the information required by this instruction and take
action to improve deficiencies. Units will notify HQ AETC/A4MMA when the monthly report
cannot be submitted on time.
4. Overview. This section describes overall base-to-headquarters reporting concepts and
requirements for the RCS: AETC-A4M(M)7501. The data provided in the MLIR is used to
provide the AETC Commander, directorates, and various divisions with an overall assessment of
unit and fleet health. It also provides data used to create and validate maximum sustainable
Utilization (UTE) rates and to build future flying hour programs.
   4.1. F-16 aircraft (F-16C/D models) are considered one MDS for monthly reporting
   purposes however, submit data by both fleet and block numbers.
   4.2. AETC-possessed C-130 variants at Kirtland AFB, NM, will be reported separately on
   the MLIR spreadsheet. However, with the exception of aircraft availability (AA), narratives
   are only required when the combined -130 (SOF-130 tab) fleet does not meet established
   standards.
   4.3. T-38C units will report Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) and Introduction to Fighter
   Fundamental (IFF) data separately on the MLIR. UPT includes: Specialized Undergraduate
   Pilot Training (SUPT), Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) and Pilot Instructor
   Training (PIT).
   4.4. F-35A data will be reported on AETC assigned aircraft only.
5. Method and Frequency of Reporting. Units will submit their monthly MLIR via e-mail to
AETC.A4MMA@us.af.mil (AETC/A4MMA) in the Global Address List (GAL).
 4                                                               AETCI21-105 18 MARCH 2013


     5.1. MLIR Spreadsheets (Numbers Portion Only). Units will only use the AETC
     provided MLIR spreadsheet. Transmit the MLIR spreadsheets (numbers portion only) to
     arrive no later than 1600 CST the seventh calendar day following the month being reported.
     If the seventh calendar day falls on a weekend or holiday, transmit the MLIR spreadsheet to
     arrive no later than 1200 CST the next workday. Ensure any links established or developed
     locally to populate the MLIR spreadsheet are broken prior to transmission.
     5.2. MLIR (The Final Report). Transmit the final MLIR, including all required comments,
     to arrive no later than 1600 CST the tenth calendar day following the month being reported.
     If the tenth calendar day falls on a weekend or holiday, transmit the report to arrive no later
     than 1200 CST the next workday. When submitting the final report, include the spreadsheet
     that was transmitted on the seventh as well as analysis and senior leader’s comments (see
     paragraph 6). Identify, in the body of the e-mail transmission, any changes in the report from
     the spreadsheet submitted. HQ AETC/A4M must approve releasing copies to agencies
     outside of the Air Force.
6. Senior Leader’s Comments. The MLIR requires senior leader’s comments to address an
overall assessment of unit, fleet, and maintenance health. The maintenance group commander
(or equivalent) will provide the unit and fleet health assessment. Information in these comments
is used in conjunction with the MLIR remarks section to brief AETC leadership and other
agencies. Suggest units address major programs, concerns and areas of interest within the
maintenance group or wing. Major programs, for example, might address the status of an aircraft
modification and its affect on meeting mission requirements or its affect on overall fleet health.
Primary concerns should relay the group or wing’s issues that warrant MAJCOM awareness or
involvement. Address concerns that may impact sortie/mission production or aircraft availability
such as a lack of covered maintenance facilities, runway closures or manning shortfalls. Areas
of interest should include any issues affecting overall fleet health or impact the unit’s ability to
meet mission requirements, improving equipment performance, identifying emerging support
problems, and projecting current trends.
     6.1. Do not simply reiterate what is contained in the analysis comments. Provide the big
     picture, group, wing perspective. Maintenance leaders are encouraged to use these
     comments as a communication tool to the HQ AETC staff. Senior leader comments are
     reviewed by HQ AETC A4/7 and issues that warrant further action are elevated through the
     chain of command.
7. Report Preparation and Format. Unit commanders will ensure the MLIR data is submitted
using spreadsheets provided by the Maintenance Management Branch, Analysis Section (HQ
AETC/A4MMA). Submit the analysis comments section and senior leader’s comments of the
MLIR as separate documents.
8. Analysis Comments. The analysis comments consist of two components: the driver
information and the analysis narratives. Both components will be provided when key indicators
do not meet established AETC standards. AETC has established standards for Aircraft
Availability (AA), Mission Capable (MC), Total Not Mission Capable Maintenance (TNMCM),
Total Not Mission Capable Supply (TNMCS), Sortie Scheduling Effectiveness (SSE), Break,
Cannibalization (CANN), Abort (total) and Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness (MSE).
     8.1. Driver Information. In the driver component, units will provide detailed information
     on items that did not meet the established AETC standard. Prepare the driver information in
AETCI21-105 18 MARCH 2013                                                                        5


   accordance with attachment 2, Analysis Comments Format. Driver information is intended to
   explain what drove an out-of-standard logistics indicator. Ensure all acronyms are spelled
   out the first time they are used.
   8.2. Analysis Narratives. In the analysis narrative component, provide narrative comments
   on items that did not meet the established AETC standard. Prepare analysis narratives in
   accordance with attachment 2, Analysis Comments Format. Narratives are intended to help
   explain the “why” for the out-of-standard indicator. Ensure all acronyms are spelled out the
   first time they are used.
9. Coordination Requirements and Correction Procedures. The maintenance group
commander (or civil service/contract equivalent) will establish internal unit coordination
requirements/procedures to ensure an accurate report is released on time. Corrections to monthly
reports will be submitted by separate e-mail with reference to the incorrect or amended data.
Each unit maintenance analysis section (or civil service/contract equivalent) will maintain copies
of monthly reports for at least two fiscal years. File copies can be maintained electronically.
   9.1. Supply Coordination. Coordinate all TNMCS and CANN drivers and narratives
   through both maintenance and supply.
10. Special Request for Logistics Data. Instances may occur where recurring short-term
special reports may be required. Periodic requirements exist for collecting data to support
special projects or track specific maintenance information. A special request for logistics data e-
mail, from HQ AETC analysis, to the unit analysis section, will be used to task units. All efforts
will be made to obtain information from enterprise systems, however, when necessary, units will
be required to provide data/information.
   10.1. Applicability. All AETC units possessing or supporting aircraft are subject to special
   requests for logistics data.
   10.2. Method and Frequency of Reporting. HQ AETC/A4MMA will provide submission
   instructions and frequency requirements in the tasking e-mail.
   10.3. Report Format. HQ AETC/A4MMA will specify report format in the tasking e-mail.
   Instructions will specify content, procedures for data collection, and report termination date.
11. AETC Logistics Standards. Standards are set for logistics indicators to a level appropriate
to the tasking of the unit and the capability of the weapon system. Logistics standards are
established by MDS and may be further established by mission within a specific MDS.
Standards are used to keep leadership advised of overall force readiness, identify and isolate
breakdowns in logistics processes and help determine if resources outside the units’ control are
needed. Standards also aid in identifying units that need further examination and assistance.
   11.1. Logistics Indicators. Logistics indicators are used to measure the health of a unit’s
   operation.    Achieving established standards should aid in meeting flying training
   requirements.    The Director of Logistics, Installations, and Mission Support (HQ
   AETC/A4/A7) may also develop standards for other metrics as needed. Standards are
   developed for the following logistics indicators:
 6                                                               AETCI21-105 18 MARCH 2013


Figure 11.1. Logistics Indicators




        11.1.1. Aircraft Availability (AA). AETC utilizes the formula in AFI 21-103,
        Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting, Attachment 25 to calculate each
        unit’s AA standards. AA standards will vary by unit; therefore, they are not published in
        the annual logistics standards/goals document.
     11.2. Modeling Process. A modeling process, as well as inputs from maintenance and
     supply functional managers, is used to help determine the correct values for realistic,
     requirements-based standards. No model reflects reality perfectly. If experience or a revised
     mission tasking reveals a need for adjustment of any standard, an out-of-cycle review can be
     initiated by HQ AETC/A4M.
     11.3. Standards and Goals Review and Development Process. Standards and goals serve
     as thresholds for further analysis. They should be challenging and tough, but attainable. If
     they are set too loose, unit capability may be degraded; if too tight, analysis tends to “chase
     ghosts,” and, if out of reach, they become irrelevant and demoralizing. The review process is
     accomplished annually, usually during the July to August timeframe, utilizing historical data
     and projected flying hour requirements. Each review involves the following basic steps:
        11.3.1. AETC analysts collect and analyze historical statistical data. AETC functional
        managers (maintenance and supply) review the historical data and analysis. The standard
        or goal for each indicator is evaluated to include current average, unit and fleet trends and
        frequency units meet the current standard. AETC analysts and functional managers then
        assess short-term and long-term support issues and make recommendations for changes,
        if needed.
        11.3.2. Historical statistical data and fiscal year projections are combined with all inputs
        and evaluated. AETC analysts develop a detailed briefing and recommendations for
        adjustments are presented to HQ AETC/A4/7 for approval.




        11.3.3. The HQ AETC/A4/7-approved standards are distributed to all AETC flying units.
AETCI21-105 18 MARCH 2013                                                                 7


     11.3.4. This review process does not preclude units from developing local standards or
     goals for other metrics as deemed necessary by their leadership.

Aircraft Availability Standard (AAS): AAS represents the number of MC aircraft or the
percentage of TAI needed to fly the required annual Flying Hour Program (FHP). In AETC, the
AAS will normally be expressed in numbers of MC aircraft required. The formula for
calculating the AAS is contained in AFI 21—103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization
Reporting, attachment 25.
Aircraft Availability Rate (AA):—The actual number of MC aircraft that were available for a
specified time period.
Actual Utilization (UTE) Rate:—The actual average number of sorties or hours flown per PAI
(or average possessed aircraft, if below PAI). See UTE Rate for formula.
Air Abort (A/A) Rate:—The total number of air aborts per 100 local sorties flown. The
purpose of this rate is to reflect the percentage of aborted missions/sorties once the aircraft is
airborne. Declaration of an air abort is an operations call. Include air aborts for maintenance
causes only.
Attrition Rates:—The total number of sorties lost (due to various reasons) per 100 local sorties
scheduled. Attrition rates are used primarily for two purposes. Programmatically, they are used
to forecast the number of scheduled sorties or missions needed to meet the requirement. During
program execution, attrition rates help to pinpoint where the flying schedule is deviating from
the plan and where to focus management actions.
Attrition Reserve (A/R) Aircraft:—Aircraft procured to replace anticipated losses of PAI due
to peacetime accidents or wartime attrition.
Average Fleet Time:—The average number of flying hours available per possessed aircraft until
the next periodic or phase inspection. Fleet time is the prime leading logistics indicator that
identifies a unit’s ability to maintain future flying and dock flow requirements. Fleet time is only
tracked for those aircraft using the periodic or phase inspection system.
Calculating Average Fleet Time:—Take three measurements before the end of the month (with
a minimum of seven calendar days between each measurement). Take one additional
measurement on the last duty day of the month. The IMDS product normally used is the Time
Distribution Inspection (TDI). Extract the total time remaining in hours and the total number of
aircraft from the TDI. Subtract out the hours and number of aircraft for aircraft not in possession
codes CA, CB, TF or ZB at the time the product was run. Report the total hours and total aircraft
of the four measurements in the MLIR.
Average Possessed Aircraft:—Possessed aircraft are available to accomplish the primary
mission of the unit. Aircraft with a possession code of CA, CB, TF or ZB are considered
possessed. Possessed aircraft hours are the key elements in calculating aircraft status.
AETCI21-105 18 MARCH 2013                                                                      11


Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI): Aircraft over—and-above the PAI to permit scheduled and
unscheduled depot level maintenance, modifications, inspections, and repair without a reduction
of aircraft for the assigned mission.
Break Rate: The percentage of aircraft that land in “Code—3” (“Alpha-3” for Mobility Air
Force) status (unable to complete at least one of its primary missions). This metric primarily
indicates aircraft system reliability. It acts as an early warning indicator, which can lead to a
lower MC rate and focuses on the quality of aircraft maintenance and parts. Do not count
Functional Check Flight (FCF) or Operational Check Flight (OCF) code-3 landings as breaks.
CANN Rate: The number of aircraft—to-aircraft or engine-to-aircraft cannibalization actions
per 100 total sorties flown. The purpose of the CANN rate is to highlight what part of the sortie
generation effort is expended removing and replacing parts from one aircraft (or engine) to
another aircraft for the specific purpose of making the latter mission capable. CANN actions
will be counted against the end item that required the canned part. CANNs are reported during
the month the removal action is completed. Note: A demand must first be placed on the supply
system, which subsequently could not be filled.
Delayed Discrepancy (or Deferred Discrepancy) (DD) Rate: The average number of
delayed/deferred discrepancies per possessed aircraft. Sometimes minor maintenance actions
must be deferred to a more opportune time. DDs fall into two categories; Awaiting Maintenance
(AWM) or Awaiting Parts (AWP). Discrepancies that are deferred AWP must have a valid off—
base requisition number. Supply should maintain an aggressive follow-up program to keep
visibility on those parts ordered for AWP deferred discrepancies. Many deferred actions
appropriately wait until a scheduled event like phase. However, maintenance should try to keep
this rate as low as possible. If delayed discrepancies cannot be scheduled or combined with a
more extensive maintenance action, maintenance schedulers should schedule aircraft down for a
day to work deferred discrepancies.
Calculating DD Rates:—This is similar to calculating average fleet time. Units will take
sample measurements using the same frequency (three measurements before the EOM (with a
minimum of 7 days between each measurement), then one final measurement on the last duty
day of the month). Only count DDs against currently possessed aircraft.
Fully Mission Capable (FMC) Rate:—The percentage of possessed aircraft that are fully
mission capable (can fly all required missions).
Functional Check Flight (FCF) Release Rate:—The percentage of aircraft that successfully
complete an FCF versus the total number of FCFs attempted. Check flights are performed to
ensure an aircraft is airworthy and/or capable of accomplishing its mission. The FCF release rate
helps monitor the quality of maintenance performed following the repair of critical components
or systems.
Ground Abort (G/A) Rate:—The total number of ground aborts per 100 local sorties attempted
(local sorties flown plus number of ground aborts) (only include ground aborts for maintenance
causes). This rate is an early warning indicator of the quality of maintenance in regards to
preflight and basic postflight maintenance. Multiple ground aborts recorded against a single line
will be included in the number of ground aborts.
Logistics Non—Delivery (LGND) Rate: The number of maintenance non-deliveries (MND) or
losses, plus supply non-deliveries (SND) or losses, per 100 local sorties (or missions) scheduled.
 12                                                                AETCI21-105 18 MARCH 2013


While MNDs focus specifically on the effectiveness of maintenance and SNDs on supply, the
overall LGND rate is an early warning indicator of the quality of logistics effectiveness and the
health of the fleet. It highlights the capability of logistics to provide aircraft to meet the needs of
the daily flying schedule.
Maintenance Man—hour per Flying Hour: The average number of maintenance man-hours
required to support each flying hour. Include all direct man-hours documented against the
aircraft MDS and its engines. Units with T-1, T-6, T-38 or TH-1 aircraft should also include all
man-hours earned through Sortie Generation Estimation Models (SGEM).
Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness (MSE) Rate: The percentage of scheduled aircraft
maintenance actions that were completed on or prior to the scheduled date printed in the weekly
schedule. The purpose of the MSE rate is to measure the success of a unit in executing its
planned maintenance schedule. Scheduled actions and their respective weighted factor points
will be used to compute the MSE rate. Use the event completion month as the basis for when to
report points possible and earned. Refer to AETCI 21—104 for additional details on computing
MSE.
Mission Capable (MC) Rate:—The percentage of possessed aircraft that are mission capable
(either fully mission capable or partially mission capable).
Non—chargeable Ground Abort: Ground aborts that do not count as chargeable deviations
toward the SSE rate. However, they are still included in the ground abort rate. (EXAMPLE:
The prime and spare aircraft both ground abort against a single line; the second abort is non-
chargeable (for SSE) but still counts toward the abort rate.)
Not Mission Capable Both Maintenance and Supply (NMCB) Rate:—The percentage of
possessed aircraft that are not mission capable due to both maintenance and supply.
Not Mission Capable Maintenance (NMCM) Rate:—The percentage of possessed aircraft that
are not mission capable due to maintenance.
Not Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) Rate:—The percentage of possessed aircraft that are not
mission capable due to supply.
Partially Mission Capable Both Maintenance and Supply (PMCB) Rate:—The percentage of
possessed aircraft that are partially mission capable for both maintenance and supply reasons.
Partially Mission Capable Maintenance (PMCM) Rate:—The percentage of possessed
aircraft that are partially mission capable for maintenance reasons only.
Partially Mission Capable Supply (PMCS) Rate:—The percentage of possessed aircraft that
are partially mission capable due to supply reasons only.
Percent MC Scheduled: The percentage of MC aircraft that are dedicated to the daily flying
schedule, either as a prime flyer (front line) or as a spare. This rate may indicate over—
commitment by a unit and can lead to diminished fleet health over time. The raw data and rates
will be reported in the MLIR for each day with scheduled flying. (See Attachment 3 for format.)
Note:—Number of MC aircraft measurement will be taken one hour prior to the first launch of
the day.
AETCI21-105 18 MARCH 2013                                                                       13


Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI):—Aircraft assigned to meet a unit’s primary mission
requirement.
Programmed UTE Rate:—The average number of sorties or hours per PAI that are
programmed to be flown. (See UTE Rate for formula)
Recur Discrepancy Rate: A discrepancy that occurs on the second, third, fourth or fifth sortie
(or attempted sortie) after corrective action has been taken following a pilot reported discrepancy
and the system or sub—system indicates the same malfunction when operated. Recur
malfunctions indicate a problem with either troubleshooting or system maintainability. Do not
count recurs on FCFs, OCFs, operational checks or ground-found problems.
Repeat Discrepancy Rate: A discrepancy that occurs on the next sortie (or attempted sortie)
after corrective action has been taken following a pilot reported discrepancy and the system or
sub—system indicates the same malfunction when operated. Like recurs, repeat malfunctions
indicate a problem with either troubleshooting or system maintainability. Do not count repeats
on FCFs, OCFs, operational checks or ground-found problems.
Sortie Scheduling Effectiveness (SSE) Rate: The percentage of scheduled sorties a unit
successfully completes as published in the printed weekly flying schedule. Non—chargeable
deviations are factored in or out by using the adjusted schedule. Schedule deviations are broken
down into two categories: non-chargeable and chargeable (see AETCI 21-104, Aircraft Planning
and Scheduling, for a detailed listing). Non-chargeable deviations are used to adjust the flying
schedule to factor out uncontrollable elements. Chargeable deviations are then measured in
relation to the adjusted schedule to compute SSE. Air aborts are not considered flying schedule
deviations and are not used in computing SSE rates. To accurately measure SSE, first reconcile
sorties flown with local sorties scheduled. Local sorties are defined in AETCI 21-104. The
flying schedule sets the pace for the entire wing. It must be built on sound principles that are
clearly articulated and vigorously defended by wing leadership. The flying schedule is an
important document that drives consumption of Air Force resources, and the sortie is the focal
point of consumption. The formula in Attachment 4 can be used to accomplish the reconciliation
of local sorties scheduled to local sorties flown
Spare Factor (Actual):—The percentage of aircraft committed to the daily flying schedule as
spare aircraft.
Total Abort Rate:—The total number of aborts (air and ground) per 100 local sortie attempts.
Total Not Mission Capable Maintenance (TNMCM) Rate:—The percentage of possessed
aircraft that are not mission capable for maintenance (NMCM + NMCB). The purpose of
TNMCM is to quantify how much aircraft downtime is attributable to maintenance and focuses
on the effectiveness of the maintenance workforce.
Total Not Mission Capable Supply (TNMCS) Rate:—The percentage of possessed aircraft
that are not mission capable for supply (NMCS + NMCB). The purpose of TNMCS is to
quantify how many aircraft are not mission capable for lack of parts and focuses on the
effectiveness of the supply system.
UTE Rate:—The average sorties or hours flown (planned or actual) per PAI or average
possessed aircraft. When a unit’s average possessed aircraft for the month is less than the
established PAI, the average possessed aircraft for the month will be used to compute UTE rates.

The purpose of UTE rates is to establish the primary performance standard that measures a
wing’s ability to meet its flying objective as well as the prime mechanism in resource allocation.

                            ANALYSIS COMMENTS FORMAT

A2.1. Analysis Comments. Detailed analysis comments are required for the following rates
that miss their standard/goal/target for the month: AA, MC, TNMCM, TNMCS, SSE, Total
Abort, MSE, CANN and Break. (Exception: Although each AETC-possessed C-130 variant at
Kirtland AFB will be reported separately on the MLIR spreadsheet, narratives and drivers are
only required when the combined -130 fleet (SOF-130 tab) does not meet established standards,
with the exception of aircraft availability (AA).) Address the root cause or causes for the missed
standard. Explain your analysis of top drivers, problem systems, problem aircraft, trends, or any
other factors affecting the indicator. Narratives must provide important details explaining why
an item drove unit performance. Analyze the data. Long-term and short-term trends are
important. Do not focus solely on the current month's data to determine if a trend exists. Look
at the entire picture to make those determinations. The question “why” must be addressed
throughout the remarks. It is impossible to provide a set format for the remarks section; it must
be tailored to the situation.
A2.2. AA Rate. When the established AA standard/target is not met a narrative explanation is
required. However, if AA was missed due to a substandard MC rate, a statement of “see MC
rate” is acceptable. If AA was not met because the average number of possessed aircraft was
below PAI, explain why aircraft were in non-possessed statuses.
   A2.2.1. AA Rate Narrative Example. “The AA standard of 68 aircraft was missed due to
   10 aircraft being at Ogden for a major avionics upgrade. Additionally, four aircraft were
   non-possessed while the wing attachments were replaced by a Contract Field Team (CFT).
   During the month we possessed 90 aircraft, five below our PAI of 95.”
A2.3. MC Rate. List the reasons that contributed to the MC rate missing the standard for the
month. If it was attributed to the TNMCM and/or TNMCS rate(s) just state “see TNMCM
and/or TNMCS rate”.
A2.4. TNMCM Rate Narrative Example. “Two aircraft with cracks caused the windshield
NMC time during the month. The downtime was extended due to a bad (also cracked)
windshield received from the manufacturer. A second windshield was ordered and received to
replace the bad one. The NMCB time on aircraft 0298 was due to maintenance working delayed
discrepancies while waiting for the second windshield to arrive. The installation of both
windshields was normal with most (150 hours) of the time consumed during rigging. Both
aircraft repairs have been completed. Fuel system time was up for March because of one aircraft
(595 hours) with fuel leaks. The majority of the NMC time (395 hours) was for a main cell. The
installation and leak checks took approximately 8 days. The repairs were completed on 29
March and no other leaks have developed on that aircraft. Phase time was significantly lower
than normal due to two fewer phases than usual (4 versus 6) being accomplished.”
   A2.4.1. TNMCM Driver Information. List the top five systems driving the TNMCM time.
   Within each system, list the top three WUC (5 digit) drivers. Break the total TNMCM hours
   down into NMCM and NMCB. In addition to these details, list the previous 12-month
   average for each system. If the top five systems are average and do not explain why the
   standard was not met, list any systems that varied significantly from their 12-month average

   and explain each. Explain anything that was out of the norm. List the system and WUC
   details using the following format (round off all hours).
   A2.4.2. TNMCM Driver Example. “Power Plant (71x) racked up 155.1 TNMCM hours.
   A0028 was responsible for 66.7 TNMCM hours against this system for the right engine
   power assurance check being low. They performed a compressor wash, but that did not solve
   the problem. An engine change was required. Nacelle (54x) accumulated 270.0 TNMCM
   hours. A0027 was the leading acft with 156.3 TNMCM hours against this system for a
   CANN of the left forward nacelle blower to A0029.”

NMCS and NMCB. Include the NSN for all NMCS or NMCB status entries. For units
supported by both COMBS and the standard base supply system, include the number of TNMCS
hours attributable to COMBS and the number of TNMCS hours attributable to the standard base
supply system separately. These units will also report all COMBS parts that took longer than the
contractual standard to deliver when those parts caused a TNMCS status on the aircraft,
including the number of TNMCS hours each part was responsible for. List the system and WUC
details using the following format (round off all hours):
   A2.5.1. TNMCS Rate Narrative Example. “They missed the supply standard for only the
   second time in six months. Two MICAPs accounted for 41% of the TNMCS time. The
   leading supply driver was a Structural Beam. (269 MICAP hours) It was a first-time demand

   DLA and at the base. Electro-Hydraulic (33x) accumulated 2215.4 TNMCS hours. A3717,
   A3822, A3546 and A3577 required props. They are not available because COMBS is
   waiting for Per-Occurrence overhaul Government funding. Government did not forecast
   these overhauls. Flight Controls (14x) accumulated 1144.5 TNMCM hours. A3920,
   A3785, and A3736 are all AWP for a control stick and there is a 30-day turn-over with many
   in the repair pipeline. A3557 is also AWP for a pedal assembly. The item was received on
   21 March, but the bushing was stuck and the item was re-ordered.”

A2.6. SSE Rate. Address themes and trends in current month’s deviations as well as trends in
deviations over the last 6 to 12 months. Concentrate on the underlying causes for not meeting
the SSE rate. Analyze operations verses maintenance deviations. State how aircraft breaks or
aborts led to a lack of available MC aircraft, which led to maintenance cancels, etc. Identify any
breakdowns in the scheduling process. Provide an analysis of the deviations.
   A2.6.1. SSE Narrative Example. “In May, they had 222 chargeable deviations, including
   98 ops non-deliveries (mostly for scheduling conflicts and pilot non-availability), 71 ops
   cancels, all to reduce the number of frontlines required, and 23 ops adds for out-and-back
   conversions and adding cross-countries. There were also 28 ground aborts (9 for engines: 2
   PMU, 1 amp, 1 no start, 1 speedbrake, 1 fuel leak, 1 generator, 1 grinding noise, 1 tail pipe
   crack; 5 for instruments: 2 altimeters, 1 engine data manager, 1 engine instrumentation
   display, 1 primary engine digital display; 4 for airframe: 2 canopy won’t lock, 1 hyd service
   door latch worn, 1 canopy test light inop) and two maintenance deletes.”
   A2.6.2. SSE Table. List the details for all chargeable deviations using the table format
   below. Spell out all acronyms the first time they are used. Narratives under the discrepancy
   and corrective action columns must be detailed enough to fully explain the deviation.
   Narratives such as “ground abort,” “no acft,” or “ops add” are not sufficient to explain the
   reason for the deviation. Provide noun of part and NSN for supply non-deliveries. Note: For
   maintenance deviations indicate any repeats or recurs, and identify the original discrepancy.

A2.7. Total Abort Rate. Address themes and trends in current month’s aborts as well as trends
over the last 6 to 12 months. Although the statement “No Trends Noted” is completely valid, do
not use it lightly. Concentrate on the underlying causes for not meeting the abort rate.
Determine if specific systems failed during the month or if certain aircraft were primary
contributors. Evaluate aborts from a preventable or non-preventable viewpoint. Did more aborts
occur on first launches? Are there problems with preflight procedures? Is there a problem
trouble-shooting and turning aircraft? Aborts that are repeats/recurs require a full history of all
discrepancies back to the original write-up. This history will include discrepancy, corrective
action, and number of sorties flown without the same problem since the last abort.
   A2.7.1. Abort Rate Narrative Example. “The fleet missed its abort standard for the
   seventh time in the past eight months. In February, auxiliary power was the leading driver
   with 17, that’s nearly double the average. (12-month average = 9) JFS no-starts were the
   leading discrepancy accounting for 70 percent of those; including a recur on one aircraft.
   (A5507, original, 7 Feb, JFS no start X2/R2 JFS door switch adjuster….Recur, 10 Feb, R2
   thermo relief valve, 12 good sorties since). Auxiliary power, more specifically, JFS no-starts
   have been identified as a seasonal trend with December through February being the highest
   months, which accounts for the spike last month. We expect JFS no-starts to decline next
   month as temperatures increase. (9 in Nov, 10 in Dec, 11 in Jan, 12 in Feb)”
   A2.7.2. Abort Table. List details on all aborts in the format below. Spell out all acronyms
   the first time they are used. Narratives under the discrepancy and corrective action columns
   must fully explain the abort. Narratives, such as “ground abort” or “engines,” do not provide
   a sufficient level of detail. The format for listing details will closely match that of the SSE
   rate section.

A2.8. MSE Rate. Explain all scheduled events that were not completed as scheduled when the
MSE standard was not met. If required, address actions taken to prevent delay in accomplishing
scheduled maintenance actions in the future.
AETCI21-105 18 MARCH 2013                                                                       21


   A2.8.1. MSE Rate Narrative Example. “The MSE standard was missed for the second
   straight month. In June, there were 16 events not completed as scheduled. Ten were because
   aircraft were undergoing other maintenance; the other six were done, but not signed off in
   IMDS.”
   A2.8.2. MSE Rate Table. List all actions that were not completed as scheduled and reason
   for not completing the scheduled maintenance action. Details will be provided in a table
   format as the example below.

A2.9. CANN Rate. Address reasons for cannibalizations. Identify parts continually canned and
projected get well date(s). Determine why the parts were unavailable. Also, address any trends
in canned items over the last 6-12 months.
   A2.9.1. CANN Rate Narrative Example. “The fleet had 12 canns, three of which were for
   a radar display monitor. The display monitor is normally a low demand item and is not
   authorized stock. Two were ordered on 4 Oct and both were received on 6 Oct.”
   A2.9.2. CANN Rate Table. List the top five canned items using the format below. List in
   order of most frequently canned parts to least frequently canned items.

A2.10. Break Rate. Address common themes in current month’s breaks. Identify common
write-ups within high driving systems or aircraft. Look for and comment on trends beyond the
current month’s data.
   A2.10.1. Break Rate Narrative Example. “They missed the break rate standard for the
   third time in the last five months. They had 19 breaks in April; four of those were for EAPS
   blower failures on one aircraft, including two repeats, (A0026, left inboard EAPS blower
   failed periodic built in test/bled #3 system and left blower inboard fail/tightened cannon plug,
   16 good sorties since) and four of them were for right engines with low power.”
