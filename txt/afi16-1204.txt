       1.7.23.5. Maintain up to date QA records, to include item location, box number, quantity, expira-
       tion date, lot number, manufacturer, manufactured date, and contract number.
       1.7.23.6. Review and update inventory report monthly, keeping the squadron commander
       informed of the status
       1.7.23.7. Identify funding requirements to the squadron commander.
       1.7.23.8. Establish requirements for deployment and transportation of medical materiel. Evaluate
       medical logistical requirements for contingency planning.
       1.7.23.9. Integrate unit medical requirements with standard medical operational plans.
       1.7.23.10. Develop evacuation and destruction plans and priorities for assigned equipment.
       1.7.23.11. Ensure all medical equipment is in operational condition. Prohibit use of non-opera-
       tional equipment to include items used during training.
    1.7.24. Budgeting for Medical Supplies. For line-funded Special Operations, Combat Search and
    Rescue, and OSM units, budgeting for medical supplies falls into two categories: WRM Allowance
    Standard (AS) items and non-AS materiel. WRM AS items are funded through the Air Force Working
    Capital Fund (AFWCF). WRM AS items may be operationally deployed. Consumed WRM AS items
    will be restocked and funded through unit O&M funding. If used to support a JTF exercise or deploy-
    ment, they may be billed against the deployment fund cite. Ref AFI 65-601, Vol. 1, Budget Guidance
    & Procedures.
       1.7.24.1. If you have UTCs assigned to your unit, follow the procedures in AFI 41-209, Chapters
       13.6.1, 13.9.2, and 13.23 for detailed information on budgeting for WRM requirements.
       1.7.24.2. Augmentation of WRM AS items must be purchased through unit O&M funds. Medical
       Logistics must work with the unit Resource Advisor to program for upcoming FY budgetary
       requirements. The past years’ historical use data provides a baseline for budgeting. Logistics per-
       sonnel must coordinate with the senior PJ for any special projected requirements. Manage stock
       levels in DMLSS to reduce your capital investment of inventory and minimize generating excess.
    1.7.25. Reporting WRM Asset Availability. Report WRM asset availability on Status of Resources
    and Training System (SORTS) based upon your Designated Operational Capability (DOC) statement.
    For specific reporting instructions reference AFI 41-209, Chapter 13.4 and AFI 10-201, Status of
    Resources and Training System.

1.10. Non-WRM Medical Kit Utilization and Configurations. T h e m e d i c a l k i t c o n f i g u r a t i o n s
described in this instruction represent medical requirements for enabling PJs to render emergency medical
care IAW USAF Pararescue Medication and Procedure Handbook, NREMT Standards of Care, and to
sustain operations in friendly, hostile, denied or sensitive territory during global land and maritime oper-
ations.
   1.10.1. The specific type or model of containers/packs chosen to serve as the Medical Ruck or acces-
   sory kits is a matter of local choice; the critical issue is the minimum contents and the employment
   concept for kit to accomplish the mission without compromising the basic tenants of medicine. This
   approach provides the minimum capability that needs to be provided, yet allows flexibility for aug-
   mentation to meet specific needs.
   1.10.2. Medical Ruck. The medical ruck consists of a backpack and an Immediate Response Kit (IR
   Kit). The minimum contents of the pack are designed to render care to two critically injured patients.
   The contents are divided into functional areas and are designed to fit into a standard pack/container to
   meet mission requirements (Adjust accordingly to meet mission needs):
       1.10.2.1. Airway Package
       1.10.2.2. Battle Packs x 2 each
       1.10.2.3. IV Infuser Kit x 2 each
       1.10.2.4. Diagnostic Package
       1.10.2.5. Ancillary Package
       1.10.2.6. Bleeding Package
       1.10.2.7. Splinting Package
       1.10.2.8. Surgical Kit
       1.10.2.9. Medications Box
       1.10.2.10. The system must be rugged; suitable for use on rotary or fixed wing aircraft; and suit-
       able for jumping, airdrop, hoist, or other alternate insertion and extraction methods. Before jump-
       ing, medical ruck’s will be evaluated IAW 11-410, Personnel Parachute Operations. Note:
       Forward a copy of the local operating instruction (OI) for medical rucks to PJ MOAB functional
       manager and AFSOC/SG for CROSSTELL purposes.
   1.10.3. Immediate Response Kit. Designed to provide rapid and minimal stabilization of life threaten-
   ing injuries of the Airway and Circulatory systems. As a minimum the IR Kit will consist of an airway
   package, battle packs, and an IV Infuser Kit. IR Kits are designed to be independent of the entire med-
   ical ruck system when mission parameters dictate.
   1.10.4. Accessory Kit. When operational requirements exceed the capabilities of the primary parares-
   cue medical ruck system the accessory kit is used to augment capabilities. The accessory kit is prima-
   rily used aboard the rescue platform or at the On-Scene staging area.
   1.10.5. Thermal Injury Kit. The Thermal Injury Kit provides medical equipment for the treatment of
   the burn and or hypothermic victim. The kit is primarily used in missions when burns or hypothermia
   are indicated or anticipated.

     1.10.6. Dive Medical Kit. The Dive Medical Kit provides medical supplies to support surface or sub-
     surface water operations. It is designed for use in conjunction with the PJ medical ruck system.
     1.10.7. Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) Kit. The NEO Kit provides medical equipment
     to support operations requiring the delivery of cardiac, pulmonary and pediatric resuscitation.
     Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) equipment is authorized for ACLS trained pararescue per-
     sonnel. It is recommended that such support be under the direction of the deployed physician or phy-
     sician assistant.
     1.10.8. Medical Resupply Kit. When operational requirements exceed the capabilities and the time
     parameters of the primary deployed UTC, the medical resupply kit is used. Medical resupply should
     be contained in the 9PJ-series UTCs tasked as follows-on packages and be able to support a thirty-day
     operation
     1.10.9. Mass Casualty Kit. The mass casualty kit supports operations exceeding the capability of the
     standard alert load out.

1.11. Deviations and Waivers. Medical supplies, equipment and medications not addressed by this
instruction may be used on a case-by-case basis at the direction of the appropriated medical command and
control who assumes responsibility for their use; or for operational missions when environmental consid-
erations or specific mission tasking necessitate their use.
     1.11.1. Units desiring permanent deviations to use medications, supplies, or equipment not included
     in this instruction or the USAF Pararescue Medication and Procedure Handbook, will forward
     requests through the appropriate command channels to PJ MOAB representative with the following
     information in narrative format:
        1.11.1.1. Procedure to be deviated from.
        1.11.1.2. Circumstances that necessitate the requirement.
        1.11.1.3. Impact of denial.
        1.11.1.4. Inclusive dates of the request.
        1.11.1.5. Specific location the waiver is to be granted.
        1.11.1.6. Unit/individuals requiring the waiver.
     1.11.2. Deviations occurring during mission execution should be reported to PJ MOAB representa-
     tive within 24 hours if operationally/tactically feasible with written waiver request submitted as soon
     as is practical. The PJ MOAB charter establishes response timeframes based on requirements, i.e.,
     emergency requests require emergency responses. Submit request through MAJCOM channels
     1.11.3. Requests must be approved by PJ MOAB representative. Forward approvals to AFSOC/SG
     for submission to PJ MOAB for consideration and appropriate disposition.

                   MEDICATION CONTROL, INSPECTION, AND STORAGE

2.1. General. The following guidance is established to ensure the proper safeguards, accounting, and
control measures of all medications maintained by the squadrons. In-depth guidance may be found in AFI
41-209, Medical Logistics Support.

2.2. Categories of Control. Drugs are designated as controlled by the Attorney General because of dem-
onstrated or potential abuse. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Department of Justice, designates
drugs as controlled substances, under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse, Prevention, and Control Act of
1970 and assigns them to one of five schedules. The term "controlled medical items" includes the follow-
ing type items:
   2.2.1. Code R applies to precious metals, drugs or other substances designated by the DEA as Sched-
   ule II controlled substances. The category includes stock listed items identified by an R in the Notes
   column of federal supply catalogs and similar non-stock listed items.
       2.2.1.1. Code Q applies to drugs or other substances designated by the DEA as Schedule III, IV,
       or V controlled substances. The category includes stock listed items with a Q in the Notes column
       of federal supply catalogs and similar non-stock listed items. The Medical Logistics Flight Chief
       may designate additional items to be accounted for and stored as prescribed for code Q items.
       NOTE: Code “Q” items fall under the same guidelines as code “R” items.
       2.2.1.2. Controlled items will be procured, stored, shipped and disposed of accordingly.
       2.2.1.3. Reporting Loss or Theft of Controlled Substances to DEA. When a loss or theft of con-
       trolled substances is determined, the Medical Logistics NCOIC will immediately prepare DEA
       Form 106, Report of Loss or Theft of Controlled Drugs, and submit it to the nearest DEA
       regional office. DEA Form 106 is available from DEA regional offices.
NOTE: All loss or theft of controlled substances needs to be reported back to the applicable MTF
through the Medical Logistics Flight CC who holds the DEA certificate. In some situations, the pharma-
cist may hold the DEA certificate.

2.3. Command Surgeons or designated representatives:
   2.3.1. Determine the type and quantities of all medications stocked, maintained and administered rel-
   evant to providing emergency medical care IAW individual qualifications and levels of certification.
   Ensure applicable coordination is accomplished with HQ USAF/SG and AFMLO and that items
   maintained are IAW applicable allowance standards (AS).
   2.3.2. Revise and update required medications keeping with current concepts of emergency medicine
   and standards of care. Authorization for utilization will be IAW USAF Pararescue Medication and
   Procedure Handbook.

2.4. Squadron Commanders:
   2.4.1. Coordinate with host MTF to ensure adequate support in the acquisition of medications
   required for mission support.

If medications were used, report type and quantity to medical logistics NCOIC within 12-hours. Pre-
scribed controlled substances must be documented in either the SF 600 or the PJ/CRO Consolidated Mis-
sion Report and must be reported to the units’ medical logistics upon return.
Inspect controlled substances for adequate quality and quantity prior to turn-in. If discrepancies are noted,
report discrepancies to the CMIC/CSIO immediately

2.9. Storage of Controlled Medications.
     2.9.1. All controlled medical items require special protection. Squadron commanders and CMICs will
     ensure that controlled medical items are properly stored and that storage areas meet the criteria in MIL
     HDBK 1191 for caged or vault storage space and in AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security
     Program (FOUO Publication available only through local Security Forces Squadron).
     2.9.2. CMICs will evaluate the adequacy of the vault and caged storage areas annually. At the request
     of the CMIC, the chief of security police and the base civil engineer may assist in the evaluation.
     Report deficiencies to the squadron commander for corrective action.
     2.9.3. For secure storage areas equipped with intrusion detection systems or duress alarm systems, the
     CMIC in coordination with appropriate base agencies will periodically check the system as required
     by AFI 31-101 and local installation policy. Record the test results on AF IMT 2530, Alarm System
     Test Record, or an automated system that meets the requirements of AF IMT 2530. Make the results
     available for verification during any inspection.
     2.9.4. The CMIC will take the following minimum precautions in safeguarding the storage and issue
     of code "R" and "Q" items:
        2.9.4.1. A vault or safe protected by a combination type lock constructed as an integral part of the
        vault/safe door or by combination padlock will be used to store operating and WRM stock. Safes
        will be placed in limited access areas. When a combination padlock is used, the hasp to which the
        padlock is fastened will be securely attached to the door and frame in such a manner as to preclude
        jimmying or prying. SF Form 701 Activity Security Checklist and SF Form 702 Security Con-
        tainer Check Sheet will be properly posted and maintained within the safe or vault.
        2.9.4.2. Only the CMIC will know the combination. Place a copy of the combination in a sealed
        envelope marked “For Use in Emergency Only” and keep it in a safe or safe type filing cabinet
        which is not used for “TOP SECRET” storage and which provides at least the same degree of pro-
        tection as the controlled substance storage area. The container for the combination will be in a
        location other than the controlled substance storage area. No other copies of the combination are
        permitted. The medical materiel NCOIC will establish operating instructions to be followed dur-
        ing alert response, or in case of an emergency when additional controlled substances are required
        to support a mission.
        2.9.4.3. Code Q items should be stored in safes or vaults. When available vault or safe storage
        capacity is inadequate, code Q items may be stored in locked cages or secure rooms with con-
        trolled access. Start action immediately to obtain the needed additional safe or vault space.
AFI16-1204 16 OCTOBER 2006                                                                               17


     2.9.4.4. Controlled items within WRM programs that are activated will be controlled in the same
     manner as in garrison assets where possible. As a minimum, items will be secured in locked rooms
     or containers.
     2.9.4.5. The combination to vaults or safes will be changed annually or upon relief, transfer, sep-
     aration, or discharge of anyone having the combination, or if there is suspicion that an unautho-
     rized individual has knowledge of the combination.
  2.9.5. Controlled substances issued to individual pararescue personnel will be stored in individual
  mailboxes. Units that don’t have the mailbox system will use their current methods of safeguarding
  the alert response controlled medications until receipt and installation of a mailbox system.
     2.9.5.1. Mount mailboxes inside a vault or in a limited access room to meet the requirements of
     double lock and key for controlled substances. The limited access room will be secured from entry
     using limited key control or padlock/cipher lock.
     2.9.5.2. Pararescue personnel will sign for one key to assigned mailbox using AF IMT 2431
     Aerospace Ground Equipment Status or equivalent. A log will be utilized to perform key inven-
     tories. Store extra keys in a sealed envelope marked “For Use in Emergency Only” and keep it in
     a safe or safe type filing cabinet which is not used for “TOP SECRET” storage and which provides
     at least the same degree of protection as the controlled substance storage area. No other copies of
     the keys are permitted. If a key or keys are lost, misplaced, or stolen, replace affected locks or cyl-
     inders at once
     2.9.5.3. Controlled substances will be stored in assigned mailboxes. Other medications may also
     be stored in the same box.
  2.9.6. Control substances will be retrieved on an as needed basis. Whenever the mission is complete,
  terminated, or otherwise over, the controlled substances will be immediately returned to the mailbox
  upon return to the base.
  2.9.7. Storage of Other Medications. Precautions will be taken in storing all other medication and
  medical kits. Medications will be properly secured. Storage in safes or vaults is desirable, however,
  when space limitations preclude this type of storage, the item will be stored in locked cabinets, cages,
  or secure rooms and access limited to selected individuals. Medications will not be left unsecured
  unless medical materiel personnel are working in view of the medications.
  2.9.8. The medical materiel NCOIC will annually evaluate the adequacy of the storage areas. At the
  request of the CMIC, the chief of security police and the base civil engineer may assist in the evalua-
  tion. Report deficiencies to the squadron commander for corrective action.
  2.9.9. During TDY/deployments, controlled substances will be safeguarded using the following pro-
  cedures:
     2.9.9.1. At a TDY/deployment location, medications should be stored at the local base medical
     facility, or security police office (must allow 24 hour access).
     2.9.9.2. In the absence of an approved safe/vault, or storage area in the alert facility, Rescue Coor-
     dination Center (RCC), or other areas that allows adequate alert response; controlled substances
     will be maintained on individual pararescuemen.
     2.9.9.3. Controlled substances may be stored on board mission aircraft if the controlled sub-
     stances are either in a hi-valued bin; or placed in a standard weapons storage container if the con-
18                                                                       AFI16-1204 16 OCTOBER 2006


        tainer is solely for medication storage. Either container must be secured to a floor tie down ring
        and the container hasp secured with a combination lock. NOTE: The combination may only be
        given to the aircraft commander, if required.
        2.9.9.4. The pararescue team leader or team member who signed for the controlled medications
        must be present on the aircraft any time controlled substances are in the bin and the bin is being
        opened for access to other equipment in the bin.
        2.9.9.5. A daily inspection of the controlled substances stored on any aircraft is required. Loss or
        theft of controlled substances at a Temporary Duty (TDY)/deployment location will be immedi-
        ately reported to the commander of the storage facility, and to the home station squadron com-
        mander. An investigation will be initiated immediately.
        2.9.9.6. Medications should not be stored aboard the aircraft when extremes of temperature
        (below 40 degrees Fahrenheit or above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, unless specified otherwise by the
        manufacturer) are anticipated. Under these conditions, the medications should be stored at the
        TDY/deployment base medical facility or in a container, which meets the temperature require-
        ments of this paragraph.

2.10. Documentation of Controlled Substances. Establish records by the fiscal year. Maintain docu-
mentation (in vault or safe) with controlled substances for a period of three years from date of last entry.
Do not remove records from the storage area, except under the personal supervision of the controlled
medical item custodian. The following records constitute accountability of controlled substances:
     2.10.1. Monthly, semi-annual, annual and biennial inventories.
     2.10.2. Record of all turn-ins, records of issue from host medical logistics and destruction documents.
     2.10.3. AF IMT 105F-2.
     2.10.4. Any item that is administered, wasted, contaminated, dropped, etc. will be documented with a
     brief explanation written and signed by the responsible PJ and team leader as a witness. If the team
     leader is not available or if the team leader is the one who experienced the loss, then the witness must
     be of a higher rank. The medical materiel NCOIC will be notified and given documentation as a
     source document. Appropriate local procedures will be initiated.
     2.10.5. Documentation of Other Medications. For bench stock materiel not managed under the WRM
     program, in-house procedures will be established to ensure control and replacement of outdated, obso-
     lete, or re-called medications and other dated materiel.

2.11. Inventory of Controlled Substances.
     2.11.1. The CSIO will complete required controlled substance inventory actions as specified in this
     AFI in conjunction with the medical logistics NCOIC.
     2.11.2. The CSIO will inventory controlled substances; enter results in the “Sign-In/Sign-Out” log-
     book. Identify action by the word 'inventory'. Ensure all receipts, issues, turn-ins, and destructions are
     entered in the “Sign-In/Sign-Out” logbook and that balance corresponds. NOTE: Controlled medica-
     tions that have been turned in for destruction or inventory require signed documentation from the per-
     son receiving the medications. Receipts will be stored in the logbook for a period of three years.
AFI16-1204 16 OCTOBER 2006                                                                                 19


   2.11.3. The medical logistics NCOIC and/or medical NCO/designated PJ will witness the inventory
   and initial beside the CSIO signature.
   2.11.4. Anytime discrepancies are noted, they will be investigated and resolved immediately.

2.12. Destruction of Controlled Substances. The following procedures may be used to destroy all types
of medical materiel or account for materiel that is turned-in to the host medical logistics. Coordinate with
host medical logistics prior to turn-in. NOTE: Controlled medications that have been turned in for
destruction or inventory require signed documentation from the person receiving the medications.
Receipts will be stored in the logbook for a period of three years.
   2.12.1. A destruction document will be prepared by the medical materiel NCOIC and used as a source
   document for subsequent processing. A manually prepared DD Form 1348-6, Single Line Item Req-
   uisition System Document, DoD (Manual-Long Form) or similar form will be used. Assign a doc-
   ument number to the destruction document using the current julian date and serial number. Each
   separate destruction document will have a separate document number.
   2.12.2. Identification and quantity of items destroyed, reason, manner, and date of destruction must
   be shown and certified by the CSDO.
   2.12.3. Two disinterested individuals will witness the destruction. These witnesses will not be of
   lesser grade than the destruction officer. The following witness statement will be placed on the back
   of the document and signed by the CSDO and two witnesses: “I have witnessed on this date the
   destruction of the materiel described on this document, in the quantity and manner indicated”.
   2.12.4. Destroy the materiel in a manner that precludes the re-use of any portion of the item for any
   purpose. Items such as needles and syringes must be unrecognizable as well as unusable. Needles and
   syringes utilized in the field will be stored in a sharps tube and returned to the medical materiel section
   for disposal.
   2.12.5. The medical logistics NCOIC will coordinate destruction methods with the resident or com-
   mand Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE) and annotate the coordination with the BEE on the docu-
   ment.
   2.12.6. The medical logistics NCOIC will annotate the destruction of controlled substance in the
   “Sign-In/Sign-Out” logbook.
   2.12.7. File destruction document with other controlled substance documentation for a period of three
   years.

2.13. Rotation of Stock. Procedures will be established by the medical logistics NCOIC to ensure maxi-
mum rotation of medications is accomplished. Coordinate with host medical logistics for support.

2.14. Theft and Pilferage. All warehouse doors will have locks. Restrict unauthorized personnel from
all storage areas. Where possible, make arrangements with the security police to periodically check exte-
rior doors and windows of the medical supply facilities during non-duty hours.

2.15. Transportation of Controlled Substances. The remarks section of administrative orders will
include a statement authorizing personnel to carry professional gear e.g., medical kits containing various
medications including controlled substances. It is best to list an inventory of specific medications actually
transported. If this is not possible, list “Narcotics Courier” on the orders of all personnel potentially able
20                                                                AFI16-1204 16 OCTOBER 2006


to carry controlled substances. Also note, that some countries are concerned about manufactured drugs
from over the counter medications i.e. Sudafed.
