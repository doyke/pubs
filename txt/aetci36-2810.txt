       the senior ranking member is the primary representative, with alternates serving in rank

           1.2.1.2. Decline to continue the previous year’s representative. If the AETC/CC

           (AETC/CCC) will:
               1.2.1.2.1. Review the three enlisted annual award winners’ packages (Airman,
               noncommissioned officer, and senior noncommissioned officer) as well as AETC

               1.2.1.2.2. If necessary, convene and chair a board to determine the best
               representative from AETC annual award winners and AETC nominees for the 12
               OAY. The board will consist of the AETC/CCC and four chief master sergeants.

       1.2.1.1).
