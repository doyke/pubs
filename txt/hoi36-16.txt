1. Background. Telework is a work flexibility arrangement where workers perform all or part
of their duty assignments at approved worksites away from the traditional office facility. It is
both an instrument of organizational business strategy and a work/life balance enabler for
personnel, involving all members of the organization regardless of their telework status.
Realizing true benefits from telework requires a commitment to establishing a viable program
with measurable goals, such as: improving the work/life balance of people, improving retention
and recruitment, making more effective use of office space and facilities, limiting unproductive
time during area emergency situations or crisis, reducing the environmental impacts of
commuting. Work flexibility arrangements help to maintain a productive workforce and
contribute to the accomplishment of our mission and service to the American taxpayer.

2. Guidance. The HAF Telework Program requires that:

    2.1. HAF organizations establish internal guidance and procedures to maximize appropriate
    use of telework as a work flexibility arrangement, to include integrating telework into
    Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) strategy, as well as continuity of business strategy
    during emergency events such as pandemic or adverse weather. Telework should be
    periodically exercised to ensure its effectiveness in continuing operations.

       2.1.1. When Federal facilities are 'CLOSED to the Public', telework-ready workers not
       on an Alternate Work Schedule (AWS) day and those scheduled to telework are generally
       expected to start the workday in a telework status. Should circumstances such as loss of
       power, loss of internet service, childcare, etc., cause the worker to not meet all conditions
       of being telework-ready, then the worker may be excused from the work expectation as
       long as the circumstance(s) exists.

       2.1.2. When Federal facilities are 'OPEN' on a scheduled telework day, teleworkers are
       expected to start the workday in a telework status or request unscheduled leave.

       2.1.3. When Federal facilities are 'OPEN' on an unscheduled telework day and a
       Delayed Arrival or Early Departure announcement is made, telework-ready workers may
       have the additional flexibility of either requesting unscheduled leave or
       starting/continuing the workday (as applicable) in an unscheduled telework status.

    2.2. Unless the nature of the job or poor performance prohibits it, every individual should be
    eligible for telework, whether on a full-time, regular, or situational basis, and should be made
    telework-ready. While telework is not a worker entitlement, every individual eligible for
    telework should be afforded the opportunity. Eligibility in this context applies to Department
    of Air Force civilian employees, United States Air Force military members, and contract
    employees (when the contract so stipulates).

       2.2.1. Eligibility criteria as established in DoD Instruction 1035.01, Telework Policy,
       Enclosure 3, paragraph 2 applies.
HOI 36-16 20 June 2011                                                                     3

        2.2.2. The standard agreement for Air Force civilian employees will be the DD Form
        2946, DoD Telework Agreement.

        2.2.3. United States Air Force military members are not required, but are encouraged,
        to have a telework agreement on file using DD Form 2946.

        2.2.4. Telework by contractors will be in accordance with their respective contracts.
        The contracting officer technical advisor (COTR), quality assurance (QA), or Program
        Manager must contact the contracting officer and their organizationâ€™s Telework
        Manager prior to any discussion of telework with a contracted employee.

   2.3. Telework and AWS are different work flexibility arrangements, but are not mutually
        exclusive.

   2.4. Any additional hardware or software supporting telework beyond that which is covered
   by HAF Enterprise Service must be approved by HAF/IM and the 844th Communications
   Group and funded by the individual organization.

   2.5. Telework, as an alternative workplace arrangement, will be considered in office/facility
   space utilization as a means to make effective use of space and provide flexibility to
   accommodate future space requirements and challenges.
