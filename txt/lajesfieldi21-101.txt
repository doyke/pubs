1. General Information. Crash Recovery Overview: The Lajes Crash Recovery program is a
combined effort of the 65th Operations Support Squadron (65 OSS) Transient Alert (TA) Section
(65 OSS/MXZT) and Air Base 4 (AB4).
     1.1. The 65 Operations Support Squadron (OSS) crash damaged disabled aircraft recovery
     (CDDAR) team will coordinate the deployment of personnel and equipment necessary to
     conduct CDDAR operations involving the recovery of all aircraft. The 65 OSS provides
     manpower and expertise within its respective specialties that recover, and if necessary
     reclaim, mishap aircraft on the island. The object remains to safely recover most damaged or
     disabled aircraft from airfield operating areas in minimum time while limiting or avoiding
     secondary damage to the aircraft or airfield.
        1.1.1. Since Lajes Field has no primary aircraft assigned (PAA), the crash recovery
        program trains only with the limitation of general crash recovery procedures. The
        program provides equipment, training and personnel to respond to all aircraft using the
        airfield including United States, Portuguese, foreign military and commercial aircraft.
        Due to the expeditionary nature of Lajes Field operations, crash recovery operations for
        specific aircraft types will only begin when directed by the 65th Air Base Wing
        commander.
        1.1.2. Response to major accidents involving military aircraft, whether on/off base, will
        be accomplished IAW AFI 10-2501 Air Force Emergency Management Program
        Planning and Operations, 28 September 2007, 65 ABW Comprehensive Emergency
        Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2, 01 January 2008, and any applicable technical
        agreements.
        1.1.3. The Fire Department (65 CES/CEF) Chief or Senior Fire Officer (SFO) is
        normally the first on-scene and is called the Incident Commander (IC).
        1.1.4.
        1.1.5. Maintenance recovery actions at Lajes may include Host-Tenant and Commercial
        Support personnel (as required).
     1.2. Tasked Organizations and Functions: The recovery program combines numerous base
     organizations and resources into a Disaster Response Force (IAW 65 ABW CEMP 10-2) to
     support recovery or mishap operations. Each organization will generate internal guidance, as
     applicable, to enhance their specific emergency response actions as defined by CEMP 10-2.
     1.3. 65 ABW CEMP 10-2: CEMP 10-2 lists the specific function of each organization and
     supplies critical guidance for various accident responses.
        1.3.1. All off-base crash recovery operations will be closely coordinated with host nation
        leadership and 65 ABW leadership.
        1.3.2. Due to current international agreements, crash recovery exercises require
        extensive coordination with AB4 and approval from Headquarters Azorean Air Zone
        (HAAZ). All exercises will be conducted IAW AFI 10-2501, Chapter 7. Coordinate all
        requests for exercises with the 65 ABW/XP office.
LAJESFIELDI21-101 12 DECEMBER 2011                                                          3


2. Crash Recovery.
   2.1. Crash Recovery Procedures: All emergency response operations remain under the
   direction of the IC. The IC or 65 ABW Commander will be responsible for determining
   combined command and control relationships with host nation forces in accordance with
   Operations Letter #1 or other combined forces agreements. Regardless of command
   relationships, only the USAF IC will direct 65 OSS Transient Alert crash recovery team
   members.
      2.1.1. The SFO acts as the IC until relieved by another trained IC. IC changes will be
      clearly communicated to all members of the crash response team (CRT).
      2.1.2. After the aircraft is determined to be “Fire Safe” the CRT Chief who is appointed
      through the 65 OSS becomes the point of contact for aircraft maintenance recovery
      operations.
      2.1.3. The CRT Chief directs the recovery team and will use the following radio call
      signs on the primary crash net:
         2.1.3.1. Recovery Team Chief (Recovery 1).
         2.1.3.2. Recovery Assistant Team Chief (Recovery 2).
         2.1.3.3. Recovery Tow Supervisor (Recovery 3).
         2.1.3.4. Recovery Tow Team Driver (Recovery 4).
      2.1.4. After normal duty hours, crash recovery support will be initiated by TA when
      required via recall procedures. Until recalled personnel are in place, the TA shift
      supervisor will assume the role of CRT Chief during non-duty hours.
   2.2. In-Flight or Ground Emergencies: After an aircraft declares either an in-flight
   emergency (IFE) or ground emergency, the Lajes Field Control Tower will notify first
   responders via the Primary Crash Alarm System. Airfield Management Operations (AM
   Ops) will in turn, activate the Secondary Crash Net and relay emergency information
   verbatim to support agencies.
      2.2.1. The following vehicles will respond to aircraft emergency calls:
         2.2.1.1. Crash/Firefighting Rescue.
         2.2.1.2. 65 OSS/MXZT Crash Recovery Vehicles (as required).
         2.2.1.3. Aircraft Tow Vehicle with the appropriate towing equipment.
             2.2.1.3.1. 65 OSS will provide the tow vehicle and tow bar to tow C-5, C-17,
             KC-10, KC-135 and C-130 aircraft. The aircraft FCC (Flying Crew Chief) will
             act as the SME and provide tech-data for emergency towing operations. Tow
             Driver qualifications will transfer to the 65 OSS/MXZT or a driver/tow team will
             be deployed as required.
         2.2.1.4. Ambulance support (65 MDOS/SGOME) via IC.
         2.2.1.5. Wing Safety representative (as required).
      2.2.2. Response formation area is near the flight line access road facing Taxiway E of
      runway 33/15 or as designated by the responding IC.

       2.2.3. The Airfield Management vehicle parks on either Taxiway C (South) or J (North)
       near the approach ends of the runway.
       2.2.4. Barrier Maintenance (65 CES/CEOFP) will standby at the approach end of the
       runway for all IFEs with the potential to engage the arresting barrier.
       2.2.5. Once the aircraft has safely landed, AM Ops will request runway closure from
       PoAF and perform a full-length inspection after the aircraft has cleared the runway.
       2.2.6. Fire/Rescue vehicles will respond to the aircraft location when it comes to a
       complete stop.
       2.2.7. The IC will determine aircraft fire safety requirements and advise the CRT when
       the aircraft is “Fire Safe.” The fire chief will initiate and/or coordinate any spill recovery
       and/or remediation actions with 65 OSS Transient Alert and the CE environmental flight.
       The CRT will not take recovery action until the fire chief has released the aircraft.
       2.2.8. After termination of the IFE or ground emergency, the CRT will continue with
       recovery services.
    2.3. Post Crash Mishap Procedures: If the IFE or Ground Emergency results in damage to
    the aircraft that prevents normal taxi or towing operation to a safe area, the emergency
    response team will perform the following functions to clear the runway or taxiway (Arrange
    the guidelines to fit the nature of the mishap response).
       2.3.1. Tasked base organizations are readily available to assist in aircraft recovery and
       reclamation actions (65 ABW/CC usually approves IC initiation of crash recovery
       operations through Installation Command Center (ICC).
           2.3.1.1. The IC assumes control of the aircraft recovery operations. Individuals will
           report to the IC before approaching or performing any actions on the aircraft.
           2.3.1.2. The CRT Chief will assign specific positions to accomplish recovery actions:
           Assistant CRT Chief (Mission Design Series (MDS) specific if possible),
           Communication Manager, Tow Vehicle Operator, Composite Took Kit Manager and
           Composite Material Containment Team.
           2.3.1.3. The CRT duty positions are outlined below:
              2.3.1.3.1. The CRT Chief directs the maintenance recovery process, assigns
              various tasks and identifies necessary equipment for a safe recovery operation
              with CRT members. The overall plan of aircraft recovery lies with the CRT Chief.
              The CRT Chief reports directly to the IC.
              2.3.1.3.2. The Assistant CRT Chief helps the team chief make critical decisions
              with aircraft recovery. The selection of this position is by qualification and
              expertise on the specific MDS of the aircraft.
              2.3.1.3.3. The Communication Manager recalls 65 OSS key personnel, CRT
              members and other agencies needed for the recovery operation.
              2.3.1.3.4. The tow vehicle operator will report to the mishap area with the
