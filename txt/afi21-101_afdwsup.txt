AFI21-101_AFDWSUP 17 MARCH 2011                                                            19


       7.2.15.1. (Added) All aircraft, engine or AGE discrepancies found during the
       acceptance inspection must be documented in the appropriate forms and the MIS.
       7.2.15.2. (Added) Aircraft/Maintenance Branch will forward discrepancies found
       during the acceptance inspection with supporting data to QA.
       7.2.15.3. (Added) QA prepares and forwards a category II report, IAW TO 00-35D-
       54, not later than (NLT) 13 calendar days after possession has been accomplished or
       upon receipt of completed inspection findings. The report will list all critical, major
       and minor discrepancies.
          7.8.3.10.1. Only changes made after the daily production meeting require AF
          IMT 2407 coordination.
       7.8.3.11. (Added) Deviations. Measure Flying Scheduling Effectiveness (FSE)
       against the daily flying schedule and Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness (MSE)
       against the weekly maintenance schedule. Any change from the weekly or daily
       flying schedule after it is coordinated at the production meeting is a deviation.
          7.8.3.11.1. (Added) Changes submitted from the 1HS to PS&D no later than
          1600L the day prior to the effected change are not considered deviations.
       7.8.3.12. (Added) Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness (MSE) Rate: FORMULA:
       Total points earned / total points possible X 100= Maintenance Scheduling
       Effectiveness Rate.
       7.8.3.13. (Added) Flying Schedule Effectiveness: The two forms of FSE are wing
       FSE and total FSE.
          7.8.3.13.1. (Added) Wing FSE, a non-chargeable deviation is one the wing does
          not control, such as weather, sympathy, ATC, and HHQ.
          7.8.3.13.2. (Added) Total FSE, only non-chargeable deviation is weather,
          sympathy, and ATC. Total FSE will enable us to depict the turbulence the HHQ
          is having on our ability to execute the flying schedule.
          7.8.3.13.3. (Added) Deviations will be recorded for one of the following
          reasons: maintenance, operations, supply, higher headquarters (HHQ), weather,
          sympathy, air traffic control, or other. The 1HS/DO and contractor will resolve
          questions concerning the recording of deviations between maintenance and
          operations.
          7.8.3.13.4. (Added) Interchanges (tail swap). Interchanges will be used to
          prevent reconfigurations and unnecessary expenditures of work hours when the
          prime aircraft is not mission capable by its scheduled takeoff time.
              7.8.3.13.4.1. (Added) Every effort is made to make the aircraft interchanges
              at the daily maintenance meeting the day before the aircraft scheduled flight
              and entered on the AF Form 2407. Interchanges that are made after the daily
              maintenance meeting and before the unit’s first aircraft take-off, AF Form
              2407’s are required (Initiating agency will be responsible for coordinating the
              AF Form 2407 through the required agencies.) Record all interchanges in
              IMDS. Below are specific examples of interchanges:
20                                        AFI21-101_AFDWSUP 17 MARCH 2011


          7.8.3.13.4.1.1. (Added) Changing aircraft in printed line numbers with
          printed spare aircraft.
          7.8.3.13.4.1.2. (Added) Changing aircraft in printed line numbers to
          different printed line numbers (tail number swap).
          7.8.3.13.4.1.3. (Added) Changing aircraft that have flown and not on the
          printed schedule with aircraft on the printed schedule.
        7.8.3.13.4.2. (Added) Enter all interchanges made at the daily maintenance
        meeting on an AF form 2407 for audit and analysis purposes.
     7.8.3.13.5. (Added) Spare. An aircraft on the flying schedule identified as a
     replacement aircraft for use when needed. NOTE: Anytime a spare is used,
     deviation code SP will be used.
     7.8.3.13.6. (Added) Maintenance (MT). Deviations resulting from aircraft
     discrepancies, unscheduled maintenance or for actions taken for maintenance
     consideration.
     7.8.3.13.7. (Added) Operations        (OP).     Deviations     resulting  from
     operations/aircrew actions including substitution/crew illness/mission changes
     causing an early/late takeoff or cancellation.
     7.8.3.13.8. (Added) Supply (SU). Deviations resulting from a Partially Mission
     Capable Supply (PMCS) or Not Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) condition or
     for late Supply or Petroleum Oils, Lubricant (POL).
     7.8.3.13.9. (Added) Higher Headquarters (HHQ). Deviations resulting from a
     higher headquarters tasking including closing of low level route or external
     customer directed mission change. Replacement of an aircraft printed in the
     weekly schedule for a higher headquarters directed alert or off base mission by a
     spare, use one of the following options:
        7.8.3.13.9.1. (Added) Option 1. The originally scheduled prime aircraft,
        which remained on base, may fly the sorties of the departed aircraft for the
        remainder of the week.
        7.8.3.13.9.2. (Added) Option 2. Interchange the sorties with a printed spare
        aircraft on each day's schedule.
     7.8.3.13.10. (Added) Weather (WX). Deviations for aircraft which takeoff
     early, late, abort, or are added or canceled due to weather conditions.
     7.8.3.13.11. (Added) Sympathy deviation occurs when a flight of two or more
     aircraft cancel abort or delay, under the command of a flight leader or instructor
     pilot of one of the aircraft in the flight or a supporting flight. Record sorties,
     which are to replace sympathy aborts or cancellations on the same day, as
     sympathy additions.
     7.8.3.13.12. (Added) Air Traffic Control (AT). Deviations resulting from air
     traffic control problems (for example, flight clearance delays, tower
     communication failure, conflicting air traffic, runway change, or runway closure).
AFI21-101_AFDWSUP 17 MARCH 2011                                                            21


          7.8.3.13.13. (Added) Other deviations resulting from the following:
             7.8.3.13.13.1. (Added) Malfunctions, failures, or necessary adjustments to
             equipment undergoing tests or evaluations associated with Operational
             Testing and Evaluation (OT&E). Development Testing and Evaluation
             (DT&E), or Initial Operational Testing and Evaluation (IOT&E).
             7.8.3.13.13.2. (Added) Commanders authorize UTE management deletions.
             7.8.3.13.13.3. (Added) Commanders          authorize    training   management
             deletions.
             7.8.3.13.13.4. (Added) Unusual circumstances not covered by the above
             definitions may use this code (e.g., bird strikes, unscheduled alert swap out).
             7.8.3.13.13.5. (Added) Exercise. Sorties added or canceled due to the
             initiation of an unannounced exercise.
             7.8.3.13.13.6. (Added) Equipment, non AFDW. Deviations caused by
             National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) or Air Intelligence Agency
             (AIA) or Air Force Material Command (AFMC) equipment, and other non-
             AFDW support and equipment.
          7.8.3.13.14. (Added) Schedule Deviations. The contractor is responsible for
          documenting deviations to the weekly/daily flying schedule and determining the
          cause for each deviation. Assign deviations after coordination with the
          appropriate agency and before assigning the deviation to a specific category. The
          OSS/CC will resolve any deviation issues. Assign schedule deviations that result
          from a primary cause sequence of events. Make a determination of the primary
          cause by the parties involved to arrive at a group position. The OSS/CC will
          make the final determination of scheduling deviations after coordination with
          outside agencies (if necessary). Record all deviations as described in this
          publication. NOTE: Deviations apply to the weekly flying schedule even though
          a coordinated change is accomplished using an AF Form 2407. When a unit
          coordinates a change using an AF Form 2407, the unit is informing everyone of
          the changed information. Do not record multiple deviations against a single line
          entry, except for additions that air abort or cancel, spares that air abort and late
          takeoffs that air abort. For deviation reporting purposes, the AFTO Form 781,
          ARMS (Aviation Resource Management System), will be the official source
          document for takeoff and landing data. For all deviations, the person recording
          the deviations in IMDS will provide a detailed explanation in the remarks section.
          This will allow managers at all levels to identify specific trends.
          7.8.3.13.15. (Added) The following paragraph lists types of deviations:
             7.8.3.13.15.1. (Added) Additions. Record an aircraft not printed to the
             schedule (added on the weekly schedule) against the agency that requested the
             additional aircraft. Functional Check Flights (FCF) and Operational Check
             Flights (OCF) whose primary purpose is to perform maintenance checks are
             not additions. Record FCF and OCF sorties as flown as scheduled.
             7.8.3.13.15.2. (Added) Early and late takeoffs caused by maintenance,
22                                     AFI21-101_AFDWSUP 17 MARCH 2011


     supply, or operations. A late takeoff occurs when a scheduled sortie becomes
     airborne more than 14 minutes after the scheduled take off time. An early
     takeoff is a scheduled sortie that launches more than 20 minutes before
     published takeoff. FTU, TF and CB aircraft will use 14 minutes for late
     takeoffs.
     7.8.3.13.15.3. (Added) Sortie cancellation. For training sorties, if the sortie
     can launch and recover during the flying window and perform its original
     mission with the original crew, a cancellation is not recorded. For hard line
     sorties (sorties that support other defense customers), cancellation occurs
     when it is determined that the originally scheduled mission cannot be met.
     However, record any sortie not launching within the late takeoff criteria as a
     late takeoff.
     7.8.3.13.15.4. (Added) Supply deviations. For aircraft not replaced by a
     spare aircraft due to supply.
     7.8.3.13.15.5. (Added) Late delivery of POL directly results in a deviation.
     7.8.3.13.15.6. (Added) Operations deviations from the weekly schedule,
     including deviations that result from over stressing the aircraft and short
     notice aircrew physical/mental disqualification.
     7.8.3.13.15.7. (Added) Record ground aborts to the responsible agency or
     condition that caused the aborted mission. Record in IMDS ground aborts on
     FCFs or OCFs but not used in flying scheduling effectiveness.
      7.8.3.13.15.7.1. (Added) If a spare replaces an aborted aircraft and that
      spare can meet the mission requirements, code the original aircraft as a
      ground abort.
      7.8.3.13.15.7.2. (Added) Launching of an aborted aircraft on the original
      scheduled mission but exceeds the 15-minute late takeoff criteria, record the
      sortie as a late takeoff.
     7.8.3.13.15.8. (Added) Air aborts. Consider an air abort as a sortie flown
     when reporting total sorties flown. Code air aborts to the agency or condition
     that caused the aborted mission. An air abort will not be recorded when
     malfunctions occur during the Before Takeoff Checklist portion of helicopter
     sorties. NOTE: Attaining the decision for an effective mission will be made
     by operations. A non-effective mission does not necessarily mean an air abort
     occurred. For example, a sortie in which all planned mission tasks were
     completed, yet the mission was non-effective because of student failure would
     not be coded as an air abort. Do not count air aborts as deviations when
     computing FSE.
     7.8.3.13.15.9. (Added) All higher headquarters deviations (e.g., local,
     destination, en route or alternate).
     7.8.3.13.15.10. (Added) All weather deviations (may be recorded for any
     weather adversely impacting mission).
     7.8.3.13.15.11. (Added) All sympathy deviations.
AFI21-101_AFDWSUP 17 MARCH 2011                                                               23


             7.8.3.13.15.12. (Added) All air traffic control deviations.
             7.8.3.13.15.13. (Added) All deviations recorded to Other.
             7.8.3.13.15.14. (Added) All supply deletes resulting from a verified NMCS
             or PMCS condition.
          7.8.3.13.16. (Added) A spare is a designated aircraft on the printed schedule for
          use, in case a scheduled aircraft cannot fly its sortie. Spares can include aircraft
          that have been canceled, aborted, flown an earlier sortie, or an aircraft that has
          been released after FCF/OCF. Do not count Printed Spares used as deviations
          when computing FSE.
          7.8.3.13.17. (Added) Do not count Tail Number Swaps as deviations when
          computing FSE.
       7.8.3.14. (Added) Scheduling Exceptions:
          7.8.3.14.1. (Added) Limited Number of Possessed Aircraft. Units or OSs with
          11 or fewer possessed aircraft of a particular MDS or assignment code are
          authorized to schedule tail numbers daily. This applies to deployed units or OSs
          that have at least 50 percent of their possessed aircraft deployed. Print aircraft tail
          numbers in the weekly schedule. Aircraft tail number changes made at the daily
          scheduling meeting will not incur a deviation. Enter the selected aircraft tail
          numbers immediately following the daily scheduling meeting into IMDS. Upon
          tail number selection, at the daily scheduling meeting, record as normal
          deviations. Although changing of aircraft tail numbers is at the daily meeting,
          measure maintenance scheduling effectiveness against the printed weekly
          maintenance schedule.
          7.8.3.14.2. (Added) Adverse Weather. Units/OSs may add sorties to the flying
          schedule to make up for weather losses. Exceeding the planned weather attrition
          for the month, prorated daily allows units to add sorties to the schedule. The
          number of sorties added will not exceed the difference between the planned
          weather attrition and actual weather losses. (EXAMPLE: Planned weather
          attrition for the month equals 30 sorties. On the 20th of the month, 40 sorties are
          lost. Unit may add ten sorties. Carefully consider the maintenance schedule and
          the ability of maintenance to support the additional requirements before adding
          sorties. Weather adding, even within planned attrition limits, is recorded as
          schedule deviations. Under no circumstances will the number of sorties added for
          weather exceed the number planned for the month.
          7.8.3.14.3. (Added) Achievement of Utilization (UTE) Rate. Accomplish
          utilization management throughout the month. Closely monitor attrition and
          determine if adjustments to the number of sorties before each weekly schedule are
          developed. This practice ensures an even sortie flow, eliminates excessive
          maintenance actions and limits the number of sorties canceled. The OSS/CC is
          responsible for the flying program and has the authority to add, cancel, or re-cut
          sorties anytime during the month. However, flying scheduling effectiveness will
          be recorded. When the OSS/CC are reasonably assured that the UTE rate goal
          will be met, they are encouraged to modify or cancel all or part of the schedule to
24                                             AFI21-101_AFDWSUP 17 MARCH 2011


        meet unit needs. Sorties that are canceled for UTE management during the last
        five Operations and Maintenance (O&M) days of the month will be recorded as
        Other. UTE rates for fighter, attack, reconnaissance (except the RQ 1), and
        forward air control aircraft are based on sorties. For all other aircraft, including
        the RQ 1, the UTE rate is based on hours.
        7.8.3.14.4. (Added) Year End Closeout. During the last 15 O&M days of the
        fiscal year, units are permitted to selectively add/cancel scheduled sorties to
        manage the end of year flying hour closeout. Record these additions/cancellations
        as Other. This provision is to help units gradually close out end of year flying
        without creating hangar queens and unintentionally exceeding the UTE rate.
     7.8.3.15. (Added) Planned Sortie Surge. A unit, OS, or a portion of an OS may plan
     to produce sorties at a higher than normal rate. When deployed and an OS is flying
     out of a different location, use a portion of the remaining OS aircraft for a planned
     sortie surge. Do not consider a planned sortie surge as a combat aircraft generation or
     an unscheduled tasking. Conduct a planned sortie surge in a manner that takes full
     advantage of training opportunities inherent in a period of increased operations and
     maintenance activity. The commander will determine the number of sorties required
     for meeting the training objectives. Sortie surge rates will exceed the daily sortie rate
     of the OS by at least 50 percent. For TF coded units, the rate will exceed the daily
     sortie rate by 25 percent.
        7.8.3.15.1. (Added) Surge scheduling scenarios will task maintenance and flying
        organizations realistically. Units will plan to get the maximum number of sorties
        possible from each airframe committed to the schedule.
        7.8.3.15.2. (Added) Exercise extreme care to avoid creating a backlog of
        unscheduled maintenance actions when scheduling sortie surges.
        7.8.3.15.3. (Added) Print aircraft tail numbers, takeoff times, line numbers, and
        configurations in the weekly schedule for the first sorties of each day. Include the
        statement sortie surge in the remark section for each affected day.
        7.8.3.15.4. (Added) Only line numbers are required on the weekly schedule for
        subsequent sorties (e.g., the total number of sorties/line numbers the unit intends
        to fly). Other data such as takeoff times, configurations, and missions may be
        printed as required by the unit. This data will be confirmed at the daily
        scheduling meeting.
        7.8.3.15.5. (Added) If more sorties are flown than what was intended (e.g., line
        numbers printed), these sorties will be considered flown as scheduled.
            7.8.3.15.6.1. (Added) Early and late takeoffs are not recorded on second and
            subsequent sorties. However, for all other deviations, normal deviation
            reporting applies. However, units will track late takeoffs and their causes to
            prevent recurrence.
        7.8.3.16.1. (Added) For scheduled combat sortie generations publish the weekly
        flying schedule as a normal schedule. On the days the unit plans to exercise,
        annotate scheduled exercise. If an unannounced exercise is initiated, that day's
AFI21-101_AFDWSUP 17 MARCH 2011                                                            25


          printed schedule will be canceled without deviation recording.
       7.8.3.16. (Added) Dispersal Sortie Generation. Conduct dispersal sortie generations
       as follows:
          7.8.3.16.1. (Added) The Air Tasking Order (ATO) will contain mission
          numbers, on status time/time on target (TOT), and configurations. A daily flying
          schedule, including aircraft tail numbers for the first lines and spares, will be
          finalized and confirmed to operations not later than 2 hours before the first on
          status/takeoff time. Normal deviations will be assessed against all sorties.
          7.8.3.16.2. (Added) When a scramble launch scenario is used, a launch window
          will be established for each line number or block of line numbers. Normal
          deviations will be assessed against all sorties.
          7.8.3.16.3. (Added) Sorties lost due to required scenario responses such as
          chemical warfare condition black, airfield attacks, etc., will be recorded as Other.
          7.8.3.16.4. (Added) If more sorties are flown than line numbers printed, these
          sorties will be considered flown as scheduled.
          7.8.3.16.5. (Added) Once the objectives established by higher headquarters or
          the commander have been met, the remainder of that day's schedule may be
          canceled without recording deviations.
          7.8.3.16.6. (Added) At the termination of the exercise which caused a unit to
          conduct a combat sortie generation, the unit's originally printed weekly flying
          schedule may be revised, canceled, or replaced with a new weekly schedule
          without recording deviations. Once finalized, normal deviation procedures apply.
          7.8.3.16.7. (Added) Unscheduled Tasking. Units may revise, cancel and replace
          any portion of the printed schedule, with a new weekly schedule, without
          recording deviations, when the following conditions exist:
              7.8.3.16.7.1. (Added) When a unit is tasked with an unscheduled higher
              headquarters or self initiated tasking (mobility exercises or weather
              evacuations), or other services tasking significantly affecting the printed
              weekly flying schedule. NOTE: Do not use an unscheduled tasking solely to
              recoup sortie losses.
              7.8.3.16.7.2. (Added) Use the following procedures for revising or canceling
              and reprinting the schedule.
                7.8.3.16.7.2.1. (Added) Follow normal deviation reporting procedures
                once the revised/reprinted schedule has been finalized. The revised
                schedule will be finalized a minimum of 2 hours before the first scheduled
                launch.
                7.8.3.16.7.2.2. (Added) Once the tasking terminates, the original schedule
                may be used, revised, or reprinted for the tasking period, as required. Once
                the schedule is finalized or reprinted, follow normal deviation reporting.
                7.8.3.16.7.2.3. (Added) Normal deviation reporting procedures will be
                followed after a takeoff time is established to a tasking by higher
 26                                                 AFI21-101_AFDWSUP 17 MARCH 2011


                  headquarters or other services.
                7.8.3.16.7.3. (Added) If the unscheduled tasking has an adverse impact on
                the monthly UTE rate goal, the commander has the option to adjust the
                monthly sortie UTE rate goal.
         7.8.3.17. (Added) Flying Scheduling Effectiveness Computations.             Compute
         monthly flying scheduling effectiveness rate by aircraft mission and design using the
         formulas below:
             7.8.3.17.1. (Added) Total Sorties Scheduled = Home Base Scheduled plus
             Deployed Scheduled plus Off Base Scheduled.
             7.8.3.17.2. (Added) Scheduling Effectiveness = Total Sorties Scheduled minus
             total Deviations divided by total Sorties Scheduled times 100.
      7.8.4. (Added) Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness (MSE) Rate. MSE rate provides
      a means to measure maintenance management effectiveness as reflected in how well the
      maintenance schedule is accomplished. Maintenance efforts should be directed toward
      the timely accomplishment of all scheduled maintenance actions. The MSE rate standard
      is 95%. PS&D computes MSE on a weekly basis.

         7.8.4.1. (Added) Computations: Scheduled maintenance events and respective
         weighted factor points in Table 7.1. (Added) will be used to compute the MSE rate.
AFI21-101_AFDWSUP 17 MARCH 2011                                                            27


       Credit is received for actions completed on, or prior to, the scheduled date as printed
       in the weekly flying and maintenance schedule. The IMDS database and the
       published schedule will be used to determine whether or not the maintenance actions
       were completed on-time. For example, if a maintenance event is scheduled in the
       weekly flying and maintenance schedule for Monday through Wednesday, IMDS
       must show completed before Thursday for credit. For maintenance events extending
       into the next week, credit for completion is based on the last day of the scheduled
       event. The ISO inspection will be measured against the scheduled completion date for
       the “Look” portion of the inspection only. This requires each ISO schedule to clearly
       identify “Look” and “Fix” portions of the inspection when publishing the weekly
       schedule. Special inspections identified on an AF Form 2410 and scheduled for
       completion during an Isochronal Inspection, Home Station Check or A-Check will
       not be utilized in the MSE rate, only the ISO/HSC/A-check will count. This does not
       eliminate the responsibility for P&S to track the special inspections to ensure timely
       completion during the ISO/HSC/A-check.
       7.8.4.2. (Added) MSE will not be computed during generations, unannounced
       exercise/ real world contingency, or a higher headquarters tasking that significantly
       impacts the printed weekly maintenance schedule. The OS/CC may direct the
       maintenance plan be revised or reprinted to incorporate missed affected actions, at
       which time, normal deviation reporting procedures will be followed once the revised
       or reprinted plan is finalized.
       7.8.4.3. (Added) Schedule deviations apply to the printed weekly maintenance
       schedule, even though a coordinated change is accomplished using an AF IMT 2407.
       When a unit coordinates a change to the printed weekly maintenance schedule, using
       an AF IMT 2407, the unit is informing everyone of the changed information and
       deviations will be recorded as appropriate.
       7.8.4.4. (Added) To compensate for adverse weather, units may revise or reprint the
       following days or remainder of that week's maintenance schedule. This adjustment
       should be used only in extreme cases and recorded on an AF IMT 2407. Once
       changed, normal deviation reporting procedures will apply.
       7.8.4.5. (Added) Maintenance Scheduling Deviation Categories:              All missed
       scheduled events will have a deviation code assigned to it. The deviation code will be
       used as a tool to help identify areas causing turbulence in scheduled maintenance.
          7.8.4.5.1. (Added) Maintenance (MT). Actions canceled or not completed as a
          result of adding aircraft to the flying schedule, mismanagement of due dates, no
          MDC to report completion, or a lack of manpower or equipment.
          7.8.4.5.2. (Added) Operations (OP). Actions cancelled or not completed on-time
          for operational considerations or as a result of adding aircraft to the flying and
          maintenance schedule to meet operations requirements. This also includes
          maintenance events not completed due to operations group actions. For example,
          Life Support Section not completing scheduled maintenance as coordinated and
          published in the wing weekly flying and maintenance schedule.
          7.8.4.5.3. (Added) Higher headquarters (HHQ). Actions canceled or not
28                                                AFI21-101_AFDWSUP 17 MARCH 2011


            completed due to higher headquarters tasking from outside of the wing.
            7.8.4.5.4. (Added) Weather (WX). Actions canceled or not completed due to
            weather conditions.
            7.8.4.5.5. (Added) Supply (SU). Actions canceled or not completed as a result of
            verified parts back order condition.
            7.8.4.5.6. (Added) Other actions canceled or not completed due to impounded
            aircraft (after the weekly schedule is published), major maintenance found during
            inspection where technical data restrictions do not allow the scheduled
            maintenance to be completed on time, or an aircraft is off-base and unable to
            return.
  8.2. (Added) QA Responsibilities. QA is responsible to the MXG/CC or equivalent.
  NOTE: In addition contractor and civil service maintenance functions will follow QA
  guidelines as outlined in their applicable performance work statement.
     8.3.11. As a minimum a KTL will be accomplished on the following component(s) that
     have been removed, replaced reinstalled or rigged. Additionally, all tasks that would
     require an FCF as specified in the applicable MDS technical data and listed below.
        8.3.11.1. (Added) Engine changes and quick engine change kits.
        8.3.11.2. (Added) Main transmission.
        8.3.11.3. (Added) 90 degree gearbox.
        8.3.11.4. (Added) Combining gearbox.
        8.3.11.5. (Added) Major structural modifications or repairs.
        8.3.11.6. (Added) Tail and main rotor hubs and components [i.e. Blade(s), Pitch
        Link(s), Control Rods(s)].
        8.3.11.7. (Added) Automatic and manual fuel controls and fuel pump assembly.
        8.3.11.8. (Added) Flight control rod(s): Primary Servos and component or linkage
        removed, reinstalled, replaced or adjusted that result in an FCF.
        8.3.11.9. (Added) Engine throttle and fuel control rigging.
        8.3.11.10. (Added) Fuel Maintenance (Fuel cell replacement and fuel cell
        maintenance).
        8.3.11.11. (Added) Tail boom.
     8.3.16. Includes the following additional programs, if applicable:
        8.3.16.1. (Added) Deficiency Reporting (DR) Program.
        8.3.16.2. (Added) Air Force Repair Enhancement Program (AFREP).
        8.3.16.3. (Added) Modification Management Program.
        8.3.16.4. (Added) Technical Order Change Request Program.
     8.3.22. (Added) QA will be aware of all ramp and parking area construction, to include
     line painting, and will work with the Programs and Resources Flight, maintenance
AFI21-101_AFDWSUP 17 MARCH 2011                                                              29


     operations, and MOC to verify that all completed construction is correct before resuming
     use.
     8.5.4. (Added) Dedicated Inspector. A Dedicated Inspector concept may be utilized.
     Dedicated Inspectors may be appointed by the QA Chief Inspector and aligned with a
     squadron. The inspector serves as the primary advisor to the squadron. Dedicated
     inspectors conduct face-to-face debriefing with supervisors to provide them with
     inspection and evaluation results. Dedicated inspectors continue to perform other QA
     duties; however, their inspection activities focus on their assigned squadron.
     8.5.5. Conducts evaluations to ensure the IMDS matches active aircraft forms. QA is
     also responsible for evaluating proper aircraft status reporting procedures. If either the
     AFTO Form 781 or the IMDS do not match, it is considered an error.
     8.9.1. Produce a Performance Plan that will at a minimum contain the following specific
     inspections:
         8.9.1.1. (Added) BPO, Preflights, Thruflights and combined BPO/Preflights.
         8.9.1.2. (Added) Towing operations.
         8.9.1.3. (Added) Refueling and Defueling operations.
         8.9.1.4. (Added) Launch and Recovery.
         8.10.8.7. Key tasks will be identified on the RIL for each MDS. Key tasks will be
         called into QA for mandatory evaluation/follow-up.
            8.10.8.7.1. (Added) Any changes to the KTL will be forwarded to the COTR
            office 7 days prior to implementation.
            8.10.8.7.2. (Added) If a grounding discrepancy(s) is discovered during the KTL
            inspection that is likely to result in a hazardous or unsafe condition the evaluator
            will not sign off the inspection and will annotate the discrepancy in the aircraft
            forms IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Once the discrepancy(s) are corrected the KTL
            inspection will be reevaluated.
                8.10.15.1.2.1. Also applies if the technician commits an equipment reliability
                error, e.g., fails to check oil during a pre-use inspection, or failure to check
                equipment forms, etc.
  8.12. Product improvement is critical in the drive for improved mission capability, mission
  effectiveness, and reduced maintenance workload. QA is the focal point for all aircraft
  maintenance deficiency reporting, maintenance tech data, and product improvement
  programs. Maintainers assigned to QA must have solid technical working knowledge of
  aircraft maintenance in order to successfully support product improvement operations.
  General knowledge of contracting and supply policies and procedures is desirable.
         8.12.1.2. Submit the electronic Microsoft Word version of AFTO Forms 22 to
         AFDW/A4MM.
  8.16. Operational Check Flights (OCFs).     Once the in-flight operational check is
  accomplished, the aircraft may continue the mission. Local OCF procedures may be
  combined with FCF procedures.
30                                                AFI21-101_AFDWSUP 17 MARCH 2011


        8.16.3.1. QA will conduct the crew briefing. QA may ask specialists with specific
        discrepancy and system repair knowledge to also be present during the briefing as
        applicable.
