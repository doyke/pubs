1. Responsibilities.
   1.1. The 460th Medical Squadron Laboratory Technicians (460 MDS/SGSC). Provide the sup-
   plies and training to individuals involved in the collection of a legal BAT. They also assure the integ-
   rity of the specimen and check the chain of custody paperwork before shipping the specimen to the 10
   MDSS/SGSAL, United States Air Force Academy for analysis.
   1.2. The 460th Security Forces Squadron (460 SFS). Escort the individual in question to the
   appropriate location to get the BAT drawn. The 460 SFS will also oversee the initial chain of custody
   process (i.e. paperwork) in order to make sure that the chain of custody is not broken. The 460 SFS
2                                                                     460SWI44-102 8 AUGUST 2005


    Commander will annually generate a letter designating an individual to be the point-of-contact for the
    legal blood alcohol-testing program.
    1.3. The Rural Metro Ambulance Technicians. Rural Metro is responsible to arrive within 15 min-
    utes of being called, draw the specimen according to the laboratory guidelines and sign the chain of
    custody paperwork.

2. Procedure. To instruct personnel in the proper procedures when using United States Air Force Acad-
emy (USAFA) Form O-772, Request for Blood Alcohol Test, (Attachment 1) when collecting blood
alcohol specimens. Proper annotation on the paperwork is absolutely vital and the key to a valid legal
blood alcohol sample. The collection, handling and transporting of the specimen are critical in maintain-
ing the blood-alcohol sample’s integrity. The sobriety examination is the evaluation of a person suspected
of being under the influence of alcohol. The specific purpose is to obtain information that can be used as
evidence for legal and/or investigative purposes in accordance with IAW AFI 44-102.

3. Legal Basis for Drawing Blood Alcohol Specimens. The 460 SFS member or squadron representa-
tive escorting the individual will indicate the condition under which the blood specimen is to be drawn.
There are four legal basis for drawing a blood alcohol specimen, (i.e. consent, probable cause, com-
mander-directed and incident to medical treatment).
    3.1. Consent. An individual agrees to a blood alcohol test. Written consent is preferred, but not
    required. AF IMT 1364, Consent for Search and Seizure, (Attachment 2) can be used to document
    a written consent.
       3.1.1. By operating a motor vehicle, drivers give implied consent to blood, breath, or urine test-
       ing. However, under the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution, drivers may revoke this con-
       sent at any time. Blood will not be involuntarily extracted from a driver who refuses to provide,
       simply because they have given implied consent. Instead, 460 SFS will seek search authorization
       from a Military Magistrate in accordance with paragraph 3.2.. In the unlikely event that no Mili-
       tary Magistrate is available, 460 SFS must consult with 460 SW/JA. Drivers who revoke their
       implied consent shall lose their base driving privileges for 1 year, and their refusal may be admit-
       ted as evidence of driving under the influence.
    3.2. Probable Cause. The installation commander or the designated Military Magistrate grants
    search authorization. Search authorization may be oral or written. Use AF IMT 1364, or AF IMT
    1176, Authority to Search and Seize, (Attachment 3) depending on the circumstances. Always con-
    tact 460 SW/JA during duty hours or the on-call 460 SW/JA after hours regarding probable cause
    search authorization. The 460 MDS/SGSC may request a verbal or in person confirmation of the
    authority to search and seize if the AF IMT 1176 is not completed at the time of the authorization.
    Consideration should be given to the effect any delay will have on the evidentiary value of the sample.
    3.3. Commander-Directed. The individual’s squadron commander, or higher authority, orders the
    individual to give a blood sample with no probable cause. Law enforcement authorities and com-
    manders should use this as a last resort only, as the results may not be available for use in actions
    under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to characterize a discharge or for other administrative
    actions.
    3.4. Incident to Medical Treatment. An examining provider orders the specimen for medical rea-
    sons. Medical treatment will not be used as a pretext to justify drawing blood in the absence of con-
460SWI44-102 8 AUGUST 2005                                                                                    3


   sent, probable cause, or commander’s direction. The determination as to the need or desirability for
   honoring the request is within the discretion of the attending provider. The specimen could also be
   ordered as a medical BAT, if legal action is not required. Make an entry on an SF 600, Health Record
   - Chronological Record of Medical Care, (Attachment 4) indicating the individual's name, date and
   time verbal consent (if applicable) was obtained.

4. Alcohol Testing on Civilians. Blood alcohol testing for civilians (including military dependents) for
offenses within the exclusive federal jurisdiction of Buckley AFB is the same as for military personnel.
However, civilians are not subject to commander-directed testing. All of Buckley AFB is exclusive fed-
eral jurisdiction except for the Buckley Annex and portions of Military Family Housing. Call 460 SW/JA
for guidance prior to non-consensual testing of civilians (Attachment 5).

5. Involuntary Extraction of Blood. Although there is a legal basis, the individual may refuse to volun-
tarily submit to the actual extraction of blood. The approval of the 460th Space Wing Commander (460
SW/CC) and the 460 SW/JA are required before force is used to procure a specimen. IAW AFI 44-102,
paragraph 2.35.2.5., “Involuntary extraction of blood must be performed in a reasonable fashion by peo-
ple with appropriate medical qualifications such as: physicians, appropriately privileged providers, clinic
nurses, designated medical laboratory technicians, and trained emergency room medical technicians.” An
entry is made on the SF 600 indicating the individual's name and time when approval from 460 SW/CC
and 460 SW/JA is obtained.
   5.1. In the absence of injury, significant property damage, or significant mission impact, blood will
   not be involuntarily extracted from persons who are suspected only of underage drinking or drunk on
   duty. The Blood Alcohol Concentration is irrelevant for these offenses. The 460 SFS members will
   take detailed notes of the person’s behavior and any physical signs of intoxication.

6. General Instructions for Specimens Collected at the 460th Medical Squadron, Buckley AFB.
   6.1. Sequence of Events. The 460 SFS member and/or the individual's first sergeant will process the
   individual before bringing them over to the laboratory.
       6.1.1. The field sobriety test will be administered once the individual is suspected of driving
       under the influence of alcohol or committing another alcohol-related offense.
           6.1.1.1. If the individual passes then the case is dropped.
           6.1.1.2. If the individual fails, then the next step is for the 460 SFS member to inform the indi-
           vidual that they will be subjected to a breathalyzer test to confirm the suspicion of intoxica-
           tion.
       6.1.2. The individual will either consent or not consent to the administration of the breathalyzer
       test. If the individual refuses, the 460 SFS member will take appropriate action. The breathalyzer
       test will be used in all circumstances unless:
           6.1.2.1. The individual has a medical condition that would hinder them from giving a proper
           sample.
           6.1.2.2. The breathalyzer test isn’t operating correctly or is out of service for other reasons.
4                                                                      460SWI44-102 8 AUGUST 2005


       6.1.3. When the breathalyzer test is not used, the individual will provide blood for a BAT if a valid
       legal basis exists. Any other reasons for not using the breathalyzer test should be coordinated
       through 460 SW/JA before calling Aurora Metro or 460 MDS/SGSC to collect a blood sample.
       6.1.4. The legal BAT is administered after a failed field sobriety test and if the breathalyzer test
       cannot be used for the above mentioned reasons. After the BAT is accomplished, the individual
       will then be released to the 460 SFS member, first sergeant or other appropriate authority.
    6.2. BAT Processing.
       6.2.1. After duty hours, the 460 SFS Law Enforcement Desk (460 SFS/LED) member will call the
       460 CES/CEF. The 460 CES/CEF will in turn notify Rural Metro Ambulance. The Rural Metro
       Ambulance Technicians should respond within 15 minutes of notification to the 460 SFS/LED.
       The Rural Metro Ambulance phlebotomist will collect the BAT specimen following the Blood
       Alcohol Checklist for USAFA Form O-772 (after hours/weekend) (Attachment 6) and using the
       supplies and forms listed on the Blood Alcohol Inventory Sheet (Attachment 7) provided by 460
       MDS/SGSC located in the 460 SFS/LED. The specimens will then be secured in the lock box. The
       lock box is placed in the designated refrigerator at the 460 SFS/LED. The 460 SFS/LED will
       notify the 460 MDS/SGSC the morning of the next normal duty day. The 460 MDS/SGSC will
       check the USAFA Form O-772 to make sure it has been accomplished properly. The 460 MDS/
       SGSC will print their name and sign the USAFA Form O-772, Part IV Chain of Custody,
       “Received By” block and then transport the samples to the laboratory. The chain of custody will
       be maintained at all times. The samples will be processed as soon as possible for shipment to the
       Air Force Academy (AFA). If 460 MDS/SGSC is unable to process the sample immediately, then
       the specimen will be stored in the lock box in the laboratory refrigerator.
       6.2.2. The 460 MDS/SGSC personnel involved in transporting, and examining biological speci-
       mens must be able to identify the specimen. The individual collecting the specimen identifies the
       patient and labels the container(s) with the patient’s full name, Social Security Number (SSN),
       date of birth, date collected, and phlebotomist initials. If the 460 MDS/SGSC collects the sample
       they complete USAFA O-772 Form, Part III. The specimens and the accompanying forms will be
       secured in a locked box until the specimen can be analyzed. The chain of custody must not be bro-
       ken for any reason.
    6.3. In-House Collection of Specimens. Individuals authorized to perform BAT blood extractions
    are specified in AFI 44-102, paragraph 2.35.2. During duty hours, (0730-1630, M-F), 460 MDS/
    SGSC will perform the extraction.
       6.3.1. USAFA Form O-772 is used to identify the individual, annotate the collection of the speci-
       mens and maintain the chain of custody. After collection, the specimens are signed by the 460
       MDS/SGSC and secured in a lock box in a refrigerator.
    6.4. Shipping of Specimens. All specimens are shipped via FedEx to the AFA. The FedEx Air Bill
    (Attachment 8) will be filled out correctly to ensure the specimen arrives at the AFA. The specimen
    is removed from the secured lock box and processed for shipment. Refrigerate the specimen until the
    FedEx courier picks the package up. One tube is sent to the AFA, the other tube is held by the 460
    MDS/SGSC until no longer deemed necessary by legal authorities, but no less than 30 days.

7. Recording/Releasing Results. Results of the chemical analysis are recorded on USAFA Form O-772,
Part V, Report of Analysis, as appropriate. The 10 MDSS/SGSAL will fax and then mail the original
460SWI44-102 8 AUGUST 2005                                                                               5


USAFA Form O-772 to the 460 MDS/SGSC upon completion of testing. The original documentation will
be given to the 460 MDS Medical Release Program NCO for filing and result release. The Medical
Release Program NCO will in turn release the legal BAT results to the appropriate individuals. The Med-
ical Release Program NCO will forward one copy of results on civilians to the 460 SW/JA, attention Mag-
istrate’s Court Program. For military members, a copy will be forwarded to 460 SW/JA, attention Military
Justice. The Medical Release Program NCO is the sole releasing authority for legal BAT test results.
Results of tests performed on military personnel will be released to civilian authorities only upon written
request by the agency head or their designee; and only after the request has been coordinated with the 460
SW/JA.
