approved for completion during PDM per the AFTO Form 103, Aircraft/Missile Condition Data,
forwarded to applicable depot facility.
7.2.7.6.1. Ordering TCIs: PS&D will schedule non-munitions type items in IMDS, complete the
AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-In Request, and forward to AMU supply personnel. AMU supply will
place the item(s) on order, record the supply document number and forward a copy back to MOF
PS&D. If the item is an issue, supply will log the parts into TNB.
7.2.7.6.1.1. (Added) MOF PS&D will complete, for all munition type items, E-DOCS 10 days
prior to the date required for scheduled parts and forward them to Munitions Accountability.

missing forms letters when directed (e.g. safety/accident investigation boards and permanent
aircraft transfers).
7.2.11.1.5. Because PS&D is centralized in MOF, Debrief may maintain the last seven pulled
sets of AFTO Form 781s from the aircraft forms binder in a consolidated file. The debrief

scheduled flight and the respective Production Supervisor should notify the 18 MXG/MXQ FCF
Manager NLT 1600 the day prior. Note: (N/A for HH-60G due to the fact that multiple sorties
are necessary to accomplish track and balance procedures during a FCF. The 18 OG/CC (CD)

AFTO Form 781A will be placed in front of existing AFTO Form 781A by the 18 MXG/MXQ
FCF Manager to identify the aircraft as entered into FCF status. All additional discrepancies will
be documented normally in the aircraft forms. The AFTO Form 781A may be transcribed at the
discretion of the QA FCF manager provided the pulled forms remain with the FCF manager until
the aircraft is released from FCF status. (F-15 only) If the FCF does not release, the AFTO Form
781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance, will be folded over at the end of the
flying day and a new AFTO Form 781H will be initiated for the next flying period. The green-
bordered AFTO Form 781A will be filed with the FCF checklist in the aircraft jacket file upon
completion of the FCF.

front of existing AFTO Form 781As by the QA FCF Manager/QA inspector. The discrepancy(s)
for component(s) causing the FCF will be referred to the green bordered AFTO Form 781A. Any
additional discrepancies will be documented normally in the aircraft AFTO forms 781As to
include QVIs due to multiple sorties. The green bordered AFTO Form 781As and regular AFTO
Form781As will be transcribed upon FCF completion. The green page and regular AFTO Form
781As will be kept and filed together as FCF forms.

standard to review aircraft forms and look for safety of flight issues.
8.16.4.1.4.2. (Added) All FCFs must be coordinated through 18MXG/MXQ at least 24 hours
prior to the flight. Notify the 18 MXG/MXQ FCF Program Manager and Flying Squadron Top-3
(Squadron Commander, Director of Operations or Assistant Director of Operations) when the
aircraft pending FCF is forecasted to be ready. For KC-135 aircraft, coordinate with the aircrew

14.31.5.3.4. (Added) The AMU OIC/SUPT will review the JOAP Program monthly centering
on timeliness of sample delivered for analysis, accuracy of documentation, and effectiveness of
overall JOAP program.
14.31.5.3.5. (Added) Propulsion Flight supervision will ensure all maintenance actions that
affect oil-wetted engine components are provided to the JOAP Lab using remarks section of the
DD Form 2026, Oil analysis Request. Ensure engine JOAP historical records are requested for
all components undergoing scheduled maintenance, transferring, or deploying. Records will be
picked up prior to component shipment. Ensure test/cell samples are delivered to the JOAP Lab
within 3 hours from the time the sample is taken. If the JOAP Lab is not manned, contact the
maintenance operations center.
