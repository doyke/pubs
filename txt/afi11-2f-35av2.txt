                                            Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. All evaluations will be conducted IAW the provisions of AFI 11-202V2 and this
volume.
1.2. Waivers. Waiver authority for this publication is the MAJCOM/A3, IAW AFI 11-202 Vol
2. Waivers will be requested from the parent MAJCOM Stan/Eval through appropriate channels.
Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the supplement and approved
through the higher level coordination authority.
1.3. Procedures.
     1.3.1. Flight examiners (FEs) will use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 3 for
     conducting flight evaluations and Chapter 4 for emergency procedure evaluations (EPE). To
     ensure standard and objective evaluations, FE will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed
     evaluation criteria.
     1.3.2. Recording devices (Portable Memory Device (PMD), air combat maneuvering
     instrumentation, etc.) should be used, when available, to reconstruct/evaluate the mission.
     1.3.3. Unless specified, the examinee or FE may fly in any flight position (to include chase)
     which will best enable the FE to conduct a thorough evaluation.
     1.3.4. The FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be
     conducted prior to flight. The examinee will accomplish required flight planning in
     accordance with the flight position during the evaluation. FEs may assist in mission
     planning/briefing as tasked and will be furnished a copy of necessary mission data, mission
     materials, and PMD loads.
     1.3.5. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the evaluation. This debrief will include
     the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than
     qualified) and any required additional training.
1.4. Grading Instructions. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-
202V2 and this instruction.
     1.4.1. Grading assumes smooth air and a stable aircraft baseline. Momentary deviations from
     tolerances are acceptable provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such
     deviations do not jeopardize flying safety. The FE will consider cumulative deviations when
     determining the overall grade.
     1.4.2. Examinees will brief and fly the desired airspeed/AOA for approaches and SFO
     parameters.
     1.4.3. Appropriate area grades will be assigned by comparing examinee performance against
     standards per Chapter 3. The overall flight evaluation grade will be derived from individual
     area grades based on a composite for the observed events and tasks.
        1.4.3.1. FE judgment must be exercised for applying subjective area grades, for specific
        situations not covered, and for assigning the overall grade.
AFI11-2F-35AV2 30 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                5


        1.4.3.2. If the examinee receives an unqualified area grade in any of the critical areas
        identified by this volume, an overall qualification level of "Q-3" will be assigned.

Table 1.1. The following general criteria apply at all times unless more restrictive in
Chapter 3.

Q         Altitude        +/- 200 feet

          Airspeed        +/- 5%

          Course          +/- 5 degrees/3 NM (whichever is greater)

          TACAN Arc       < 3 NM



Q-        Altitude        +/- 300 feet

          Airspeed        +/- 10%

          Course          +/- 10 degrees/5 NM (whichever is greater)

          TACAN Arc       > 3 NM



U                         Exceeded Q- limits
1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). In order of preference, the EPE will be
conducted in a flight simulator (Mission Rehearsal Trainer (MRT) or Full Mission Simulator
(FMS)) or verbally. Only conduct a verbal EPE if a flight simulator is not available or not
configured appropriately for the evaluation. Grading criteria for each required item are listed in
Chapter 4. This evaluation will include areas commensurate with examinee's Ready Aircrew
Program (RAP) training level and event qualifications.
     1.5.1. The following items are required on all emergency procedure evaluations:
        1.5.1.1. Emergency Procedures. All Critical Action Procedures (CAP) will be evaluated
        by the examinee completing a written CAPs test at the beginning of the EPE and
        executing all CAPs during the EPE. Any incorrectly completed written CAP will result in
        a ―U‖. The EPE will not be started until successful completion of the written CAPs.
            1.5.1.1.1. In addition to the CAP requirement in paragraph 1.5.1., additional "non-
            CAP" emergency procedures will be evaluated. Non-CAP emergency procedures
            will be selected from Table 2.2.
            1.5.1.1.2. A minimum of one additional emergency procedure from the Ground
            Emergencies Section of F-35A Flight Series Data (FSD).
6                                                    AFI11-2F-35AV2 30 SEPTEMBER 2010


           1.5.1.1.3. A minimum of one additional emergency procedure from the Takeoff
           Emergencies Section of F-35A FSD.
           1.5.1.1.4. A minimum of two additional emergency procedures from the In-flight
           Emergencies Section of F-35A FSD.
           1.5.1.1.5. A minimum of one additional emergency procedure from the Landing
           Emergencies Section of F-35A FSD.
       1.5.1.2. Aircraft General Knowledge.
       1.5.1.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM).
       1.5.1.4. Unusual Attitude Recoveries. This also fulfills the Area 15 (Unusual Attitude
       Recoveries) requirement for Instrument/Qualification (INSTM/QUAL) evaluations.
    1.5.2. All INSTM/QUAL EPEs will include the following additional items:
       1.5.2.1. AFMAN 11-217, Instrument Flight Procedures. Evaluate a minimum of one
       helmet-mounted display (HMD) –out approach and use of standby/emergency
       instruments. Emphasis should be on whether the approach would permit a safe landing.
       1.5.2.2. Alternate/divert airfields. Evaluate a minimum of one approach at other than
       home base.
    1.5.3. All Mission (MSN) EPEs will include the following items (tailor MSN evaluation
    scenarios to unit tasking/mission).
       1.5.3.1. Weapons system operation.
       1.5.3.2. Electronic attack (EA)/Electronic Protection (EP)/All Aspect Missile Defense
       (AAMD).
       1.5.3.3. Evasive action/Threat Reaction.
       1.5.3.4. Weapons employment and switchology.
    1.5.4. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised status
    until recommended additional training is completed and/or a reevaluation is successfully
    accomplished. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade because of an unsatisfactory
    CAP accomplishment will not be permitted to fly until a successful reevaluation is
    accomplished. For EPEs in which the examinee is qualified, but requires additional training,
    the FE will indicate whether the additional training will be accomplished before the next
    flight. Additional training and reevaluations will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202V2.
    1.5.5. When the INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluations are combined, a single EPE may be
    administered to fulfill the requisites for a combined MSN/INSTM/QUAL evaluation. The
    combined EPE must be of sufficient scope and length to ensure all required areas for each
    evaluation are accomplished.
    1.5.6. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs:
       1.5.6.1. Q. Performance is correct. Quickly recognizes and corrects errors.
       1.5.6.2. Q-. Performance is safe, but indicates limited proficiency. Makes errors of
       omission or commission.
AFI11-2F-35AV2 30 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              7


       1.5.6.3. U. Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability.
1.6. Documentation of Weapons Employment Results. Weapons employment results will be
documented in the Mission Description Section of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
Qualification, for MSN evaluations. Include entries for each type of actual and simulated
ordnance that was employed.
   1.6.1. Air-to-Surface. Results will be recorded as Hit or Miss for each air-to-surface record
   delivery. Flight examiners may use either AFI 11-2F-35A Volume 1, F-35A--Aircrew
   Training, individual weapons events or current MAJCOM RAP tasking message events (e.g.
   combined events, etc.) when determining grading or assigning additional training. Document
   results as in Table 1.2
   1.6.2. Not Used.
   1.6.3. Air-to-Air. Record the number of simulated missile/gun firing attempts and the
   number that were valid as in Table 1.2 Shot validity will be evaluated at pickle with all
   parameters IAW Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-1 Shot/Kill.
   1.6.4. FE Judgment. FE judgment will be the determining factor in deciding the weapons
   employment grade. The FE may elect to award a higher area grade than warranted by the
   score(s), the FE will include the justification in the Comments Section of the AF Form 8.
   Include entries for each type of simulated ordnance that was employed.

                                            Chapter 2

                               EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General.
     2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2.
     2.1.2. Required areas for flight evaluations are detailed in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 for EPEs.
     When it is impractical or not possible to accomplish a required flight evaluation area in-
     flight, it may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., FMS, MRT, or by verbal
     examination) in order to complete the evaluation. Document the reason and type of alternate
     method used in the Additional Comments portion of the AF Form 8. If the FE determines the
     required item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate method, the examinee will
     require an additional flight to complete the evaluation.
        2.1.2.1. Areas annotated with an "R" are required items for that evaluation.
        2.1.2.2. Areas indicated with an ―R2‖ require evaluation of at least two of the items
        under the associated section for that evaluation (All CAPs are required to be
        accomplished for both INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluations).
     2.1.3. Publications Check. Currency of Flight Publications. Evaluate all issued
     publications/checklists for currency and accuracy on all flight evaluations. Units may specify
     additional publications to be evaluated in the unit supplement to AFI 11-202V2.
     2.1.4. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). In accordance with AFI 11-290,
     Cockpit/Crew Resource Management, CRM skills will be evaluated during all evaluations.
     CRM skills are integral to all phases of flight and are embedded within specific grading
     criteria; therefore, no specific evaluation criteria area titled CRM exists.
     2.1.5. Combined Evaluations. With the approval of the Operations Group Commander, the
     INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluation may be combined as a single evaluation. Unit
     Commanders should recommend this option only for experienced pilots. Combined
     evaluations flown in this manner must fulfill all current INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluation
     requirements, including ground phase requisites. One EPE may be accomplished that
     encompasses requirements of both EPEs, with additional simulator time as required to
     complete all items.
2.2. Instrument/Qualification Evaluation. A mission flown according to instrument flight
rules (to the maximum extent practical) best fulfills the objective of the INSTM/QUAL
evaluation. To the maximum extent possible, this evaluation will include approaches at airfields
other than home or deployed locations United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE): Preferably
non-US locations). Approaches may be flown to fields which have a non-published, practice
approach available (e.g. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) conditions only approach), but not a
published Flight Information Publications (FLIP) approach. The intent is to grade instrument
procedures which are independent of an approach’s certification (to use a non-published
approach, the approach plate must be built using the standards applied to published approach
plates, local Operations Group Standardization/Evaluation (OGV) must approve use of the
AFI11-2F-35AV2 30 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                9


approach, and approval for the approach must be documented in the local unit supplement to AFI
11-202V2). This evaluation may be administered on any compatible training mission.
   2.2.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
       2.2.1.1. Instrument examination.
       2.2.1.2. Closed and open book qualification examinations.
       2.2.1.3. EPE.
       2.2.1.4. CAPs Written Exam. Answers must contain all critical action items in proper
       sequence. Abbreviations are allowed.
2.3. Mission Evaluation. MSN evaluations will be flown IAW current tactics, unit tasking,
theater Area of Responsibility scenarios, and will incorporate all appropriate evaluation
requirements from Table 2.1. Scenarios that represent unit Designed Operational Capability
(DOC) tasking satisfy the requirements of this evaluation. The profiles will be designed to
evaluate the training/flight position/special qualifications as well as basic airmanship of the
examinee. Initial MSN evaluations will be given in the primary DOC of the unit unless directed
otherwise by the squadron commander due to assigned contingency tasking. Examinees will be
evaluated in the position of their highest qualification. At the FEs discretion, portions may be
flown in another position, but the emphasis is to have examinees evaluated at their highest
qualification level. Wingman may be required to brief (to include tactics) and/or lead certain
phases of the mission, but will not be evaluated for flight leadership. Evaluations during
exercises or exercise deployments are encouraged. Evaluations during contingency/combat
deployments will be given as a last resort in order to maintain mission qualification status.
Note: Basic Mission Capable (BMC) aircrew will only be evaluated on those missions routinely
performed. Examinees will only be evaluated on those areas for which they are qualified.
   2.3.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
       2.3.1.1. EPE.
       2.3.1.2. Air Defense qualified pilots in wings which support a full-time ASA detachment
       (or home-station alert) will complete at least one Air Sovereignty intercept during every
       Mission EPE.
       2.3.1.3. CAPs Written Exam. Answers must contain all critical action items in proper
       sequence. Abbreviations are allowed.
   2.3.2. Air-to-Surface. This evaluation will include, as a minimum, navigation to initial point
   (IP), planned weapons employment and threat reactions. First-look navigation and look-alike
   targets are encouraged. For examinees that are certified Combat Mission Ready/BMC in
   nuclear and conventional tasking, the evaluation will emphasize only one scenario. Mission
   profiles should include actual delivery of practice or live ordnance.
   2.3.3. Air-to-Air. This evaluation will include, as a minimum, one intercept, offensive
   maneuvering and planned weapons employment. When practical, adversaries should simulate
   enemy aircraft, tactics and ordnance IAW AFTTP 3-1. Dissimilar aircraft are preferred.
   Additionally, pilots:
       2.3.3.1. Fly multiple intercepts when weather or other restrictions prohibit Dissimilar Air
       Combat Training (DACBT)/ Air Combat Training (ACBT), or Low Altitude Training.

       2.3.3.2. Air Sovereignty Alert (ASA) mission evaluations will be sampled by ASA
       assigned units.
           2.3.3.2.1. ASA assigned unit pilots, qualified in the ASA mission tasking, will
           complete an Air Sovereignty Tasking (AST) event during Mission EPEs.
   2.3.4. Reconnaissance. A day visual sortie will be used to the maximum extent possible. A
   minimum of three targets will be assigned and more than 50 percent acquired for successful
   completion of the mission. Exceptions to the minimum number of targets are permitted for
   enhanced profiles and specialized missions. Successful acquisition of targets will be based on
   the requested elements of essential information and/or FE judgment. In-flight targets may be
   assigned by the FE. Targets not acquired due to adverse weather, verified sensor malfunction
   or threat reaction will not be charged against the pilot.
   2.3.5. FAC(A). Air-to-surface evaluation requirements/grading criteria will be used when
   determined applicable by the FE.
2.4. Formal Course Evaluation. Syllabus evaluations will be flown IAW syllabus mission
profile guidelines if stated, or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training objectives.
Formal course guidelines may be modified, based on local operating considerations or FE
judgment, to complete the evaluation. Training objectives and related areas will be graded using
the performance criteria in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4.
2.5. Instructor Evaluation. Instructor evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2.
   2.5.1. Initial Flight Evaluation. To initially qualify as an instructor in the F-35A, the pilot
   must successfully complete an initial instructor evaluation. This is a one-time evaluation in
   which the examinee must demonstrate ability to instruct in some phase of the unit's mission.
   Except for requirements delineated under Area 33, Instructor Performance, in Chapter 3,
   specific profiles and/or events will be determined by the flight examiner.
   2.5.2. Subsequent aircrew evaluations (i.e. INSTM/QUAL and MSN) will include instructor
   portions during the evaluations.
   2.5.3. Chase Procedures. Formal Training Unit (FTU) Instructor Pilots (IPs) will be
   evaluated on chase procedures during INSTM/QUAL or MSN evaluations prior to
   performing FTU duties for the first time. Subsequent evaluation of chase procedures will be
   IAW para. 3.2.33.
   2.5.4. FTU and Weapons Instructor Course (WIC) Mission Evaluations. USAF Weapon
   School (USAFWS) and FTU Instructor Pilot mission evaluation profiles will normally be
   IAW the formal course syllabus for any MSN which the IP is qualified to instruct. The only
   required items for an FTU or WIC IP mission check are those items required by the syllabus,
   for the specific sortie being flown.

Notes:
1. Airwork/Advanced Handling/Tactical Maneuvering. This area is required for pilots
receiving INSTM/QUAL evaluations. Maneuvers can be:
   a. Aerobatics
   b. Advanced handling characteristics / Confidence maneuvers
   c. Any Air-to-air mission (Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM), Air Combat Maneuvering, Air
   Combat Training, adversary training aid etc.)
   d. Any Air-to-Ground mission (CAS, AI, etc.)
   e. Formation (fingertip, tactical, trail)

2. Simulated Flame Out (SFO) Traffic Patterns/Approach/Landing. Pilots unable to
accomplish an SFO during their INSTM/QUAL evaluation may delay this emergency traffic
pattern/approach requirement until their next periodic evaluation (usually a MSN evaluation).
When delayed until the next periodic evaluation, that evaluation will be incomplete until the
SFO is accomplished. Exception: Should adverse weather conditions impede accomplishment of
an SFO, a simulator/MRT/FMS evaluation may be used only after every attempt has been made
to evaluate the SFO in the eligibility window of the subsequent evaluation. To evaluate an SFO
via simulator/MRT/FMS requires prior MAJCOM/A3T approval on a case-by-case basis. Pilots
not requiring a MSN evaluation must accomplish an SFO during every INSTM/QUAL
evaluation and can also pursue MAJCOM/A3T (AFRC – AFRC/A3V) approval to evaluate it
via simulator/MRT/FMS on a case-by-case basis. For all cases, if an SFO is evaluated via
simulator/MRT/FMS the subsequent INST/QUAL evaluation must include in-flight evaluation
of the SFO. Verbal evaluation of an SFO is never approved. Document non-standard SFO
evaluations in the Additional Comments portion of the AF Form 8.
3. Precision Approach. At least one precision approach must be flown to complete the flight
evaluation. Annotate types of approach(es) flown in the mission description. (USAFE: aircrew
will fly a PAR if available).
4. AETC. These items are not required on FTU Instructor evaluations when syllabus profiles
make accomplishment impractical (e.g. BFM mission checks). Document the omissions in the
Additional Comments portion of the AF Form 8.
5. Air-to-Ground Weapons Employment. Grade Hit/Miss IAW paragraph 3.4.3.2.
6. USAFWS. These items are not required on USAFWS Instructor evaluations when syllabus
profiles make accomplishment impractical. Document the omissions in the Additional
Comments portion of the AF Form 8.
7. ASA Units. ASA wings are waived and authorized to evaluate Air-to-Air Weapons
Employment (Area 77) during EPE profiles.

     3.2.2.2. Presentation:
         3.2.2.2.1. Q. Presented briefing in a professional manner covering all pertinent
         items. Effectively used available briefing aids. Flight members clearly understood
         mission requirements.
         3.2.2.2.2. Q-. Some difficulty communicating clearly. Did not make effective use of
         available briefing aids. Dwelt on nonessential mission items.
         3.2.2.2.3. U. Failed to conduct/attend required briefings. Failed to use available
         briefing aids. Redundant with lack of continuity. Lost interest of flight members.
         Demonstrated lack of knowledge of subject. Presentation created doubts or confusion.
     3.2.2.3. Mission Coverage:
         3.2.2.3.1. Q. Established objectives for the mission. Presented all training events and
         special interest items. Included effective technique discussion for accomplishing the
         mission.
         3.2.2.3.2. Q-. Omitted items pertinent, but not critical, to the mission. Limited
         discussion of training events or special interest items. Dwelt on non-essential items.

        uncorrected. Could not effectively separate from the engagement or could not regain
        mutual support.
     3.4.1.11. Area 61--Timing. Time will be based on preplanned time on target (TOT), time
     to target (TTT) for ordnance impact or vulnerability period (SEAD/Defensive Counter
     Air) or push time (Offensive Counter Air Sweep). CAS missions may use either TOT or
     vulnerability period (VUL) criteria, depending on tasking. This area may be evaluated as
     a First Run Attack or with FAC coordination. Adjustments in TOT will be made for non-
     pilot caused delays. In the case of "no spot," timing will be adjusted to a bomb release or
     "off" call. If range clearance is delayed, time at a preplanned IP may be substituted for
     TOT. The FE may widen this timing criterion if the examinee was forced to maneuver
     extensively along the ingress route due to simulated enemy air or ground defense
     reactions, ATC instructions, and/or weather.
        3.4.1.11.1. Conventional/Recce:
