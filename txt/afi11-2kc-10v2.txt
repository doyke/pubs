https://cs.eis.af.mil/aircrewpubs/AMC%20847%20Program/default.aspx IAW procedures in
AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP) and MAJCOM Supplement.
1.8. Evaluations. This instruction establishes standardized instrument, qualification, mission,
and instructor evaluation criteria. It also establishes the areas/subareas necessary for the
successful completion of evaluations, and which required areas/subareas will be considered
critical and/or non-critical.
1.9. Evaluation Requirements. Accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practical.
Crew Resource Management (CRM) skills will be evaluated on all evaluations. KC-10 aircrew
members will complete the following evaluations, at 17-month frequency according to AFI 11-
202V2, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement:
     1.9.1. Instrument (INSTM) Evaluation. All KC-10 pilots will successfully complete a
     periodic instrument evaluation including the requisite instrument refresher course (IRC)
     open-book written examination according to AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Course
     Program, and an aircrew training device (ATD) /flight evaluation.
     1.9.2. Qualification (QUAL) Evaluation. All KC-10 aircrew members will successfully
     complete a periodic qualification evaluation including the requisite open-book, closed-book,
     Boldface written examinations, emergency procedures evaluation (EPE), and an ATD/flight
     evaluation.
        1.9.2.1. The KC-10 simulator (SIM) and Boom Operator Trainer (BOT) will be used in
        conjunction with all qualification, EPE, and, if applicable, the instrument (INSTM)
        evaluations. Evaluations will only be performed in approved simulators and must be
        conducted by an Air Force Flight Examiner (not contractors). Evaluations will only
        consist of areas/sub areas that can be realistically accomplished and are ATD-creditable
        per AFI 11-2KC-10V1, KC-10 Aircrew Training.
     1.9.3. Mission (MSN) Evaluations. All KC-10 crew members will complete a mission
     evaluation. Pilots and flight engineers complete all tasks required in the performance of
     normal operational and training sorties upon successfully completing a MSN evaluation.
     Boom operators will successfully complete a periodic mission evaluation.
AFI11-2KC-10V2 21 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                           7


  1.9.4. Instructor (INSTR) Evaluations. To initially qualify as an instructor in the KC-10,
  crew members will successfully complete an initial instructor qualification course and
  evaluation. Subsequently, aircrew members designated as instructors will be evaluated on
  their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations. Crewmembers may use the initial
  instructor evaluation to satisfy the requirements of the periodic QUAL and MSN evaluations.
  Refer to the specific aircrew chapter for requirements.
  1.9.5. SPOT Evaluations. A SPOT evaluation is an evaluation not intended to satisfy the
  requirements of a periodic (i.e., INSTM, QUAL, MSN, or INSTR) evaluation. SPOT
  evaluations have no specific requisites or requirements unless specified in MAJCOM
  supplements or this AFI. See AFI 11-202V2 for options available to convert a SPOT
  evaluation to meet requirements of a periodic evaluation.
  1.9.6. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). See AFI 11-202V2 and the following: The
  KC-10 SIM and BOT will be used to accomplish the EPE. SPOT evaluations do not require
  an EPE.
     1.9.6.1. Units may develop and maintain a list of EPE program requirements (topics,
     special interest, etc.) in local supplement or OI. The EPE should include areas
     commensurate with the examinee’s graduated training (e.g. initial, line, instructor,
     evaluator) or as specified in AFI 11-202V2 and MAJCOM Supplement.
     1.9.6.2. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in-flight. The
     examinee must be able to recite all Boldface items from memory and provide the initial
     steps of selected emergency procedures that would not allow time for reference.
     1.9.6.3. Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified will be placed in
     supervised status until recommended additional training and re-evaluation are completed.
     Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified because of unsatisfactory
     Boldface procedures will not be permitted to fly in their aircrew position until a
     successful re-evaluation is accomplished. Accomplish additional training IAW AFI 11-
     202V2.
  1.9.7. Evaluation Prefixes. Use AFI 11-202V2 evaluation prefixes for AF Form 8,
  Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, and AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation.
     1.9.7.1. For a re-qualification (RQ) evaluation that results from a failed periodic or
     SPOT evaluation, include all areas under GENERAL and any sub-area graded “U”.
     NOTE: evaluations intended to re-qualify a crewmember after a failed SPOT evaluation
     will be documented as “RQ SPOT” unless the examination is intended to re-align a
     periodic evaluation.
     1.9.7.2. Conduct re-qualification (RQ) evaluations for a loss of currency, expired
     periodic evaluation, or commander-directed downgrade IAW AFI 11-202V2.
     1.9.7.3. Difference Evaluations. The phrase “difference” is used to describe the
     evaluation of one or more areas to meet qualification requirements. Normally, a
     difference evaluation will include areas that are different between aircraft models,
     systems, or operations not previously qualified to operate (e.g., CNS/ATM). A difference
     evaluation does not have expiration date established because the evaluation does not
 8                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V2 21 SEPTEMBER 2012


        satisfy the requirements for the “full” periodic evaluation. See crewmember’s chapters
        for difference evaluation requirements.
            1.9.7.3.1. For administrative purposes, annotate AF Form 8, flight phase as a SPOT
            evaluation (according to AFI 11-202V2) and paragraph 1.9.5 above.
1.10. Grading Policies.
     1.10.1. The overall qualification level awarded an evaluation is based on performance during
     both the flight and ground phases. This grade should be awarded only after all evaluation
     requirements have been completed and given due consideration.
     1.10.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the aircrew member must satisfy the
     criteria set forth for that evaluation and demonstrate ability to operate the aircraft and/or
     equipment safely and effectively during all phases of the evaluation.
     1.10.3. Use the grading criteria in this instruction to grade areas/subareas accomplished
     during an evaluation.
        1.10.3.1. The flight examiner may grade any area/subarea accomplished during an
        evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation
        accomplished or flight safety.
     1.10.4. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not possible, the area may be verbally
     evaluated or evaluated in an ATD. Flight examiners will make every effort to evaluate all
     required areas in-flight before resorting to this provision. See AFI 11-202V2 AMC SUP I
     and the appropriate chapter for areas prohibited from verbal/ATD evaluation.
     1.10.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions. Minor
     momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the pilot applies prompt corrective action and
     such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider cumulative deviations when
     determining the overall grade.
        1.10.5.1. For pilots only, if the flight manual recommends a specific airspeed range for
        performance of a maneuver, the flight examiner will apply the grading criteria to the
        upper and lower limits of that range.
        1.10.5.2. Flight examiners will use sound judgment in the application of the grading
        criteria in this instruction to determine the final grade.
1.11. Grading System. Refer to AFI 11-202V2.
1.12. Unsatisfactory Performance. Refer to AFI 11-202V2.
1.13. Conduct of Evaluations.
     1.13.1. Flight examiners will pre-brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, requirements
     of the evaluation, and all applicable evaluation criteria. Flight examiners will then evaluate
     the examinee in each graded area/subarea.
        1.13.1.1. Flight examiners will normally not evaluate personnel they have primarily
        trained, recommended for upgrade evaluation, or who render their effectiveness reports.
AFI11-2KC-10V2 21 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                 9


   1.13.2. Unless otherwise specified, flight examiners may conduct the evaluation in any crew
   position/seat which will best enable the flight examiner to observe the examinee’s
   performance.
   1.13.3. Note discrepancies and deviations from prescribed tolerances and performance
   criteria during the evaluation. Compare the examinee’s performance with the tolerances
   provided in the grading criteria and assign an appropriate grade for each area.
       1.13.3.1. An evaluation will not be changed to a training mission to avoid documenting
       substandard performance, nor will a training mission be changed to an evaluation.
       1.13.3.2. The judgment of the flight examiner, guidance provided in AFI 11-202V2, and
       this instruction will be the determining factors in assigning an overall grade. The flight
       examiner will thoroughly critique all aspects of the flight. During the critique, the flight
       examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area/subarea
       grades assigned, and any additional training required.
       1.13.3.3. In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the flight examiner will recommend
       additional training requirements. Normally, additional training should not be
       accomplished on the same flight. EXCEPTION: Additional training on the same flight is
       allowed when, in the evaluator’s judgment, unique situations presenting valuable training
       opportunities (e.g., thunderstorm avoidance, crosswind landings) exist. This option
       requires utmost flight examiner discretion and judicious application. When used, the
       examinee must be informed of when the additional training begins and ends.
       1.13.3.4. When evaluations are less than Q-1 performance, the flight examiner will
       debrief the examinee and examinee’s commander (supervisor). Notify the squadron
       commander/operations officer and flight commander/chief, if available.
   1.13.4. The SIM/BOT may be used to accomplish additional training and re-checks. Areas
   for additional training and re-checks should be limited to those areas/subareas that can be
   realistically accomplished in the SIM/BOT.
   1.13.5. Rechecks will normally be administered by a flight examiner other than the one who
   administered the original evaluation.
1.14. Use of AF Form 3862, Flight Evaluation Worksheet. Units (normally OGV) will
overprint AF Form 3862, using the examples in Attachment 2 as an evaluation worksheet. Copy
each title, area number and text (in the order illustrated) to the appropriate blocks. Units may
add special interest items and/or local evaluation requirements. In-flight, use the worksheet to
ensure all required areas are evaluated. Record positive and negative trend information and
aircrew member’s performance. File the signed AF Form 3862 or signed draft copy of the AF
Form 8 in the aircrew member’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) IAW AFI 11-202V2. Maintain
until the completed AF Form 8 is filed in the FEF, and then discard.
1.15. Aircrew Testing. See specific testing requirements in AFI 11-202V2 and include the
following:
   1.15.1. Open-Book Exam (Open-Book). The open-book examination should normally be
   administered before the initial flight evaluation and subsequently with periodic flight
   evaluations. The open-book examination will consist of 60-100 questions. The examination
   questions will come from a Secure Question Bank (SQB) created and managed by each
 10                                                AFI11-2KC-10V2 21 SEPTEMBER 2012


   OGV. A portion of the open-book examination administered to flight instructors will include
   instructor (scenario-based) questions. A separate (unique) INSTR open-book examination is
   not required for periodic evaluations.
   1.15.2. Initial Instructor Open-Book Exam (INIT INSTR Open-Book). Administer an initial
   instructor open-book one time before the initial instructor flight evaluation. The instructor
   open-book examination is requisite for INIT and RQ INSTR flight evaluations only. The
   examination will have a minimum of 20 questions from directives including AFMAN 36-
   2236, Guidebook for Air Force Instructors, AFI 11-2KC-10V1, V2, and V3 (including
   MAJCOM supplements) and other common flight or instructor related sources. Questions
   should include scenario-driven instructor related questions.
   1.15.3. Closed-Book Exam (Closed-Book). The closed-book examination should normally
   be administered before the initial flight evaluation and subsequently with periodic flight
   evaluations. The closed book exam will be constructed IAW AFI 11-202V2, para 6.4.2.
   Complete a Boldface exam in conjunction with the closed book examination.
   1.15.4. Instrument Exam. See AFI 11-202V2 requirements.
1.16. Typical KC-10 Evaluation Profile.
   1.16.1. Units should ensure that SIM/BOT evaluation profiles should include areas/subareas
   that are ATD creditable.
   1.16.2. As a minimum, flight evaluation profiles should include areas not ATD creditable.
   SIM/BOT evaluation profiles will be comprehensive enough to limit verbally evaluating
   subareas.
AFI11-2KC-10V2 21 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                              11

                                  PILOT EVALUATIONS

2.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic, and re-qualification evaluations,
including the requirements for instrument, qualification, mission, and instructor evaluations.
2.2. Instrument Evaluations. KC-10 instrument evaluations may be accomplished in the
simulator; however, evaluate circling and PAR approach in-flight, if available, in conjunction
with the qualification evaluation.
2.3. Qualification Evaluations. Qualification/re-qualification evaluations should be
accomplished and logged in conjunction with mission and instrument requirements (e.g.
INSTM/QUAL/MSN).
   2.3.1. For initial (INIT) or re-qualification (RQ) evaluations that conclude a formal training
   program and periodic evaluations, include all areas under GENERAL, QUALIFICATION,
   MISSION, and INSTRUMENT.
   2.3.2. Evaluate dual-seat qualified pilots on at least one instrument approach and landing in
   both left and right seats. One approach and landing is required in the actual aircraft. Other
   approaches and landings may be evaluated in the ATD. These pilots will also be evaluated
   on taxi operations in the left seat.
   2.3.3. When not intended to lead to AC certification, non-prior MWS dual seat pilots (PIQ
   graduates) will not be evaluated in receiver AR. Receiver AR rendezvous, breakaway, and
   overrun may be evaluated in either seat, if observed. Document crew position for these
   evaluations as “/FP” on the AF Form 8. With the recommendation of SQ/DO, subsequent
   periodic evaluations may be intended to lead to AC certification. These evaluations will
   include receiver AR in the left seat and will be documented with “/MP” for crew position.
   All pilots must receive an aircraft commander evaluation (documented as “/MP”) prior to AC
   certification.
   2.3.4. Simulator Evaluations. Conduct a simulator evaluation in conjunction with all initial,
   periodic and re-qualification evaluations. Use a contractor-developed scenario or a unit
   Standardization/Evaluation approved and flight examiner-provided scenario. Unit/flight
   examiner-provided scenarios must be coordinated with the contractor a minimum of one day
   before the evaluation to ensure compatibility with ATD software. Only items listed as ATD
   creditable training events in AFI 11-2KC-10V1 may be evaluated. However, pilots will not
   be evaluated on circling approaches, visual traffic patterns, or receiver air refueling in the
   ATD. Additionally, landings will not be evaluated in the ATD during initial PIQ/ACIQ
   qualifications. Evaluation of landings in the ATD for re-qualification pilots are at the
   discretion of the evaluator. Evaluate all areas that can be evaluated realistically in
   simulation. Use the following:
       2.3.4.1. Evaluate all pilots in abort procedures, Engine Failure Takeoff Continued
       (EFTOC), 2-engine approach and missed approach, and a random selection of other
       abnormal and emergency procedures and Boldface.
 12                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V2 21 SEPTEMBER 2012


       2.3.4.2. Dual-seat qualified pilots may occupy the right seat during a portion of the
       simulator evaluation, but must demonstrate checklist usage and a random selection of
       abnormal and emergency procedures from the left seat.
       2.3.4.3. PIQ students are not expected to fulfill the role of an aircraft commander on their
       initial qualification evaluation. Document this evaluation as “/FP” in the crew position,
       on the AF Form 8.
       2.3.4.4. PIQ pilots are required to complete an additional simulator evaluation prior to
       aircraft commander certification, focusing on aircraft commander roles and
       responsibilities. Evaluatee will occupy the left seat for this evaluation and must
       accomplish the requirements listed in paragraph 2.3.4.1 Document this evaluation as
       “/MP” in the crew position, on the same AF Form 8 as the receiver AR evaluation.
       2.3.4.5. Evaluate ACIQ students in the role of aircraft commander during their initial
       evaluation.
   2.3.5. Tanker Air Refueling (A/R). Rendezvous is required. Initial qualification pilots are
   required to perform a Tanker Rendezvous and A/R in the simulator as well as the flight
   evaluation. Initial qualification pilots are required to conduct a portion of the inflight
   evaluation with the autopilot off. For Upgrade, Periodic and Requalification evaluations,
   accomplishment of the event in the simulator or inflight will satisfy evaluation requirements.
   2.3.6. Receiver A/R. Rendezvous or closure from a minimum of 1 NM is required. Initial
   and re-qualification ACs will demonstrate 15 minutes of contact time within a 30-minute
   period of arriving in the pre-contact position. Evaluate ACs in the left seat. Evaluate
   instructors in either seat. Evaluate dual seat pilots in the left seat only when the evaluation is
   intended to lead to AC certification. During periodic evaluations, 10 minutes of contact time
   within a 20-minute period of arriving in the pre-contact position is required. Conduct a
   portion of the evaluation with tanker autopilot off.
   2.3.7. Senior Staff Evaluations. All Senior Staff Officer initial, periodic and re-qualification
   evaluations include (as a minimum) the following required areas:
       2.3.7.1. All areas under GENERAL.
       2.3.7.2. All areas under QUALIFICATION, except area 19, Engine Out Operations, and
       area 22, Other Emergency Procedures.
       2.3.7.3. All areas under “INSTRUMENT.”
       2.3.7.4. Evaluate Senior Staff Officers in a random selection of Boldface, abort
       procedures, and Engine Failure Take off Continued (EFTOC).            NOTE: Since Senior
       Staff Officers do not maintain a MISSION qualification in these areas, they may not
       occupy a pilot’s seat during Tanker A/R or Receiver A/R with passengers aboard.
       Annotate the appropriate restriction on AF Form 8, Examiners Remarks. Time and
       training conditions permitting, Senior officers may elect to be trained, IAW AFI 11-2KC-
       10 Volume 1, and evaluated in Tanker AAR, Receiver AAR, and right seat landings. If
       so, no restriction is required, but clearly document that tanker and/or receiver AR was
       accomplished in the examiner’s remarks.
2.4. Mission Evaluations. Evaluate all areas under GENERAL and MSN. Every attempt must
be made to evaluate formation procedures on periodic evaluations in the aircraft. If unable to
AFI11-2KC-10V2 21 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                  13


comply, formation procedures must be verbally evaluated and annotated in the examiner’s
remarks section. Evaluate tactical procedures only if observed.
   2.4.1. Operational Mission Evaluation (OME). All pilots will complete a one-time
   operational mission evaluation demonstrating their ability to operate in command of an
   aircraft performing the unit’s primary mission prior to aircraft commander certification. The
   following may be used to satisfy this requirement:
       2.4.1.1. A combination INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation on a local training mission
       provided the following conditions are met:
           2.4.1.1.1. Approved by the OG/CC or equivalent.             Blanket approvals will be
           documented in the unit supplement or OI.
           2.4.1.1.2. The evaluation is focused on decision making and CRM.
           2.4.1.1.3. The following subareas must be evaluated in the actual aircraft: ground
           operations/taxi, tanker A/R (ACIQ only), and receiver A/R.
       2.4.1.2. A SPOT evaluation given on a 618 AOC (TACC) tasked or locally assigned
       Dual Role or JA/AAT mission.
       2.4.1.3. In all cases document the OME on the Form 8 with the following comment in
       the remarks section, "This OME was conducted in conjunction with aircraft commander
       certification."
2.5. Instructor Evaluation (Initial, Periodic, or Requalification). Flight examiners will place
particular emphasis on the examinee’s ability to recognize student difficulties and provide
timely, effective, corrective action. As a minimum, demonstrate and instruct an instrument/visual
approach. Conduct initial or re-qualification instructor evaluations in the aircraft with a qualified
pilot occupying the other seat. The examinee will normally occupy the right seat.
   2.5.1. Initial: Include all areas under GENERAL, QUALIFICATION, MISSION, and
   INSTRUCTOR. NOTES: Note: 1. Pilots, who desire to realign their qualification/mission
   evaluation during the initial instructor evaluation must also demonstrate all required
   areas/subareas in “INSTRUMENT” and complete all required requisite written examinations.
   Comply with AFI 11-202V2 para 5.8.3.1 and 7.3.4.4.5. Note: 2. During initial/re-
   qualification evaluations, 10-minutes of contact time within a 20-minute period of arriving in
   the pre-contact position is required. Conduct a portion of the evaluation with tanker autopilot
   off. Limited inadvertent disconnects are permissible during a boom limits demonstration and
   therefore will not be counted against the examinee.
   2.5.2. Periodic instructor evaluations will be administered in conjunction with required
   instrument and qualification evaluations and require all areas in GENERAL,
   QUALIFICATION/MISSION, INSTRUMENT, and INSTRUCTOR. NOTE: During
   Receiver A/R, limited inadvertent disconnects are permissible during a boom limits
   demonstration and should not detract from the examinees’ performance.
2.6. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). Evaluate a pilot’s knowledge of emergency
procedures and systems knowledge in the simulator portion of all INSTM/QUAL/MSN
evaluations (see paragraph 1.9.6).
2.7. Additional Information.

   2.7.1. Pilots may conduct evaluations when scheduled as primary aircrew members.
   2.7.2. Instructor and flight examiner pilots receiving periodic evaluations may be evaluated
   in either seat, but are still required to comply with paragraph 2.3.2. Left seat taxi operations
   are not required.
   2.7.3. Flight examiners, instructor pilots, and touch-and-go certified aircraft commanders
   will be evaluated during the completion of a touch-and-go as either the pilot-flying or the
   pilot-not-flying in either the ATD or aircraft.

                           FLIGHT ENGINEER EVALUATIONS

3.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic and re-qualification evaluations,
including the requirements for qualification, mission and instructor evaluations.
3.2. Qualification/Mission Evaluations. Dual log mission evaluation with qualification/re-
qualification requirements (e.g. QUAL/MSN).
   3.2.1. For initial, periodic or re-qualification evaluations, include all areas under GENERAL
   and QUALIFICATION/MISSION.
   3.2.2. Tanker and Receiver AAR should be evaluated in-flight for all initial qualification
   evaluations.
   3.2.3. Simulator Evaluations. Conduct a simulator evaluation in conjunction with all initial,
   periodic and re-qualification evaluations. Evaluate all grading criteria that can be evaluated
   realistically.
       3.2.3.1. Use a contractor-developed scenario, or a unit Standardization/Evaluation
       approved scenario provided by the flight examiner. Unit or flight examiner-provided
       scenarios should be coordinated with the contractor a minimum of one day before the
       evaluation to ensure compatibility with ATD software, and a logical flow of the
       evaluation profile.
          3.2.3.1.1. Evaluations administered using refresher training simulator scenarios
          should be carefully reviewed to ensure the minimum requirements are observed (see
          paragraph 3.2.3.2). Pre-coordinate scenario alterations with the contractor.
          3.2.3.1.2. A minimum 2-hour simulator evaluation period is required.
       3.2.3.2. Evaluate all flight engineers in abort procedures, a random selection of abnormal
       and emergency procedures, and Boldface, and Tanker and Receiver AAR.
3.3. Mission Evaluations. See paragraph 3.2.
3.4. Instructor Evaluations (Initial, Periodic, and Requalification). Flight examiners will
place particular emphasis on the examinee’s ability to communicate and instruct, to recognize
student difficulties, and to provide timely, effective corrective action. For all instructor
evaluations include all areas in GENERAL, QUALIFICATION/MISSION, and INSTRUCTOR.
   3.4.1. INIT INSTR (flight and simulator) evaluations should be administered with the
   examinee performing instructor duties to a student occupying the flight engineer position.
       3.4.1.1. If a student flight engineer is not available, flight examiners (or another qualified
       flight engineer) may act as student for the purpose of evaluating instructor ability.
   3.4.2. Recurring instructor evaluations may be administered in conjunction with the
   QUAL/MSN evaluation. To satisfy the QUAL/MSN evaluation requirements, the examinee
   will occupy the flight engineer position and perform all associated primary duties.
       3.4.2.1. In this case, the method used to evaluate instructor ability is at the flight
       examiner’s discretion, and should be based on the experience level of the examinee.
AFI11-2KC-10V2 21 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                              29


          3.4.2.1.1. Actual in-flight or ground instruction of a student is preferred.
          3.4.2.1.2. Instructor ability may be evaluated by other means, if mission requirements
          or student availability dictate (i.e. flight examiner or another qualified crewmember
          acting as student, a detailed systems/procedure briefing, etc.)
   3.4.3. Flight engineers desiring to realign their QUAL/MSN evaluation during their INIT
   INSTR evaluation must demonstrate all items under QUALIFICATION/MISSION, and
   complete all required requisite written examinations.
       3.4.3.1. The examinee should be in their QUAL/MSN eligibility period to realign. If
       not, the Out-of-the Eligibility Period criteria of AFI 11-202V2 paragraphs 5.8.3 and 5.8.4
       apply.
       3.4.3.2. For realigning evaluations, a minimum of one 4-hour simulator evaluation
       period is required. During the 4-hour simulator period, 2 hours will be scheduled to
       evaluate the examinee performing primary duties (occupying the Flight Engineer
       position), and 2 hours to evaluate instructor duties.
       3.4.3.3. Realigning flight evaluations must be completed on two separate sorties, to
       ensure all primary and instructor duties are comprehensively evaluated.
       3.4.3.4. Document the realigned INIT INSTR and QUAL/MSN evaluations on two
       separate AF Forms 8 when possible.
3.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). Evaluate a flight engineer’s knowledge of
emergency procedures and systems knowledge during the simulator portion of all QUAL/MSN
evaluations (see paragraph 1.9.6).
   3.5.1. The EPE should cover a cross section of aircraft systems, to comprehensively assess
   examinee knowledge and application.
