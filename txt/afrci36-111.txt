1.4. Registration in the AOCMP:
    1.4.1. The CMB requires all ART officer personnel below GS-15 level to register in the AFRC
    AOCMP. If militarily eligible without waiver, other permanent Air Force employees may also regis-
    ter for assignment to an AFRC officer position.
    1.4.2. Employees may register by submitting completed AF Form 2675, Civilian Career Program
    Registration and Geographic Availability, to their servicing CPO. After the first registration, the
    employees may update and resubmit the form whenever desired.
    1.4.3. ART officers are considered for promotion or competitive reassignment only if they are prop-
    erly registered in the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) as a career program member.
    Consequently, ART officers should confirm their registration in the AFRC AOCMP periodically (for
    example, annually and after a permanent change of station (PCS) move).
    1.4.4. As the approving authority, AFRC/CV may approve registration for ART officers within 11
    months of a PCS move and refer them command-wide to ART officer vacancies. I f selected for a
    position requiring a PCS move, AFRC/CV, his or her designee, or H Q AFRC/DPC approves the
    waiver of the requirement for no PCS moves within 12 months.
    1.4.5. Each ART officer should consider the following in completing AF Form 2675:
       1.4.5.1. Since their mobility agreement applies to all ART officers, the CMB requires promotion
       or reassignment consideration regardless of geographic availability.
       1.4.5.2. Availability does not, in itself, guarantee selection.
       1.4.5.3. The selecting official may choose from up to 15 certified promotion eligibles or from
       other sources (for example, HQ AFRC/DPC (SEU) appointment eligibles).
       1.4.5.4. Since AFRC/CV may authorize case-by-case exceptions to allow geographical screening
       based upon the needs of AFRC, registrants should ensure they are registered for geographic loca-
       tions of their choice, including current location.

1.5. Career Progression:
    1.5.1. Each first-and second-level supervisor of a n ART officer should periodically counsel and
    advise employees on matters affecting their career progression. Supervisors should counsel based on
    first-hand knowledge of the abilities, interests, and desires as related to the career objectives of each
    ART officer.
    1.5.2. The para-military nature of ART officers creates a uniqueness that dictates developmental
    efforts aimed at the military and civilian phases of their careers. Accordingly, the CMB and supervi-
    sors consider the "whole person" when determining assignments. Notwithstanding their military
    responsibilities, ART officers are full-time civilian employees. Therefore, the CMB and selecting
    supervisors must exercise care in the planning and scheduling of assignments to assure compliance
    with the laws and regulations governing civilian employees.
    1.5.3. The CMB and selecting supervisors may use the provisions of chapter 3, ART Officer Merit
    Promotion Plan, and FPM Supplement (Internal) 930-71, Recruitment of Air Reserve Technicians
    Through Competitive Examination, as well as applicable OPM and Air Force guidance in considering
    individuals for promotion and competitive reassignment. (See chapter 2 for processing of tentatively
    selected candidates.)
AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996                                                                            9

1.6. Career Management Board (CMB) Members. AFRC/CC/CV appoints the members to serve on
the CMB. The chairperson of the CMB is a general officer and is normally AFRC/CV. Each senior ART
numbered air force (NAF)/CC/CV serves as a permanent board member. A typical board composition is
the board chairperson, the three senior ART NAF/CCs/CVs and three other members. In addition to the
CMB chairperson, a minimum of five members serve on t he CMB. If re quired for e fficiency of o pera-
tions, the CMB may subdivide into rating panels to rate candidates for different grade levels.

1.7. CMB Program Elements. The CMB must consider the individual’s total background and projection
of management or e xecutive potential. T his "whole person" identification criteria may include training
and experience, supervisory appraisals, awards and recognition, PME, and self-development activities,
etc.

1.8. CMB Procedures:
   1.8.1. The CMB reviews promotion registers, including the rating and ranking of c andidates. ( See
   chapter 3.) After identifying the best qualified eligibles, the CMB may:
       1.8.1.1. Review and establish/validate the registers.
       1.8.1.2. Use AFRC Form 138, ART Officer Career Management Program Promotion Regis-
       ter and Evaluation Sheet, to further evaluate candidates.
       1.8.1.3. Use a consensus or assign points to each candidate considered.
       1.8.1.4. Review and discuss individual rankings. Use reduction-in-force (RIF) civilian service
       computation date to break final ranking ties.
   1.8.2. After final rankings of qualified eligibles on promotion registers:
       1.8.2.1. The CMB establishes, and the CMB chairperson authenticates, command-wide promo-
       tion registers for appropriate positions. These are official documents which normally contain suf-
       ficient names to ensure HQ AFRC/DPC can certify 10 to 15 candidates (if that many are available)
       to a selecting supervisor for a given vacancy).
       1.8.2.2. HQ AFRC/DPCC prepares and issues promotion certificates from each command-wide
       promotion register for a minimum of six months from date of its authentication. Promotion certif-
       icates may be on AFRC Form 157, Merit Promotion Program Certificate/Referral List. (See
       chapter 3 for employee certification, consideration, and selection procedures.)
       1.8.2.3. Upon request, HQ AFRC/DPCC informs candidates of t heir final ranking as a result of
       the CMB evaluation.

1.9. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Costs. Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), volume 2, Depart-
ment of Defense Civilian Personnel, govern the payment of PCS costs. A OCMP PCS moves to GS-12
level (including GS-11 target GS-12) and above ART officer positions are eligible for the Relocation Ser-
vices (RS) program. (See chapter 6.)

               SELECTION OF PERSONNEL TO FILL ART OFFICER POSITIONS

2.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on command procedures and responsibilities for selection
and placement of personnel for ART officer positions. It applies to all AFRC units employing ART offic-
ers and to CPOs servicing those units.

2.2. Background. HQ AFRC strives to select th e best available candidates for ART officer positions.
Since 1977, AFRC/CV and the ART officer CMB have required HQ AFRC/DPC to administer all
AOCMP assignments (for example, civilian promotions, changes-to-lower grade, reassignments). In
addition, since 1979, AFRC/CV and the CMB have required HQ AFRC/DPC to provide "centralized
recruitment" for all ART officer positions. These requirements were initiated to improve timeliness in
filling ART officer vacancies, improve overall recruitment servicing, provide centralized career manage-
ment, etc. To accomplish these requirements:
     2.2.1. HQ AFRC/DPCC approves all civilian personnel actions affecting ART officers before being
     effected. The only exceptions are CPO-controlled actions involving entitlements and position classi-
     fication actions such as transfer of function, RIF, position upgraded due to new classification standard,
     etc. The servicing CPO should coordinate these type actions with HQ AFRC/DPCC before being
     effected and submit copies of SF 50-B, Notification of Personnel Action, to HQ AFRC/DPCC when
     effected.
     2.2.2. Appointments of ART or non-ART temporary employees to ART officer-level positions do not
     require approval above the local unit commanders. Therefore, the servicing CPO processes them in
     the same manner as any other temporary recruitment action which does not require HQ AFRC
     approval.

2.3. Responsibilities When Filling ART Officer Positions by Promotion, Appointment, Competi-
tive Reassignment, or Other Competitive Means: (S ee attachment 2, Selecting Supervisor’s (SS)
Checklist for Filling Air Reserve Technician (ART) Officer Vacancies.)
     2.3.1. Unit Commanders/Supervisors:
        2.3.1.1. When a selecting supervisor has or projects an ART officer position vacancy, he or she
        initiates an SF 52, Request for Personnel Action, to the servicing CPO to fill the vacancy on a
        permanent basis unless the unit commander desires to delay filling of the vacancy.
        2.3.1.2. AFRC does not "double slot" authorizations. Consequently, if vacant Unit Manpower
        Document (UMD) authorizations do no t exist, supervisor must either wait until authorization is
        vacated, or obtain overhire, if appropriate.
        2.3.1.3. Ensure completion and accuracy of all necessary documents (for example, the manpower
        Authorization Change Notice (ACN) and/or a copy of an approved AFRC Form 106, Manpower
        Authorization Change Request, (or other official document) authorizing any changes in the
        UMD data of the position.
        2.3.1.4. Provide any special instructions on filling the vacancy for the servicing CPO to include in
        the request-to-fill message or memorandum they send to HQ AFRC/DPCC.
AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996                                                                              11

        2.3.1.4.1. If the selecting supervisor provides no special instructions for the request-to-fill
        message or memorandum, HQ AFRC/DPCC contacts the selecting official to see if he or she
        wants to consider other sources.
        2.3.1.4.2. If a selecting supervisor requests an SEU certificate, include:
            2.3.1.4.2.1. Any special instructions such as name requests (with social security number).
            2.3.1.4.2.2. How long (30, 60, or 90 da ys) to "earmark" the request (that is, don’t certify
            until name request is available).
            2.3.1.4.2.3. Any selective certification or "quality ranking factors" (that is, special or addi-
            tional KSAs desirable for this position).
        2.3.1.4.3. Upon supervisor’s request, HQ AFRC/DPCC may refer qualified and available pro-
        motion candidates, employees requesting reassignment or CL G, VRA, and reinstatement/
        transfer eligibles, along with the SEU candidates.
     2.3.1.5. Consider sources of c andidates. After the servicing CPO clears appropriate regulatory
     priority considerations, (for example, local RIF, DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP) (known
     as the "stopper list")), unit commanders/supervisors have authority to consider and make tentative
     selections for pe rmanent positions from any appropriate source of qua lified candidates. "Quali-
     fied" means candidates who meet all civilian and military qualification requirements. Sources of
     candidates may include:
        2.3.1.5.1. ART officers with restoration rights following a military tour. (Selection is manda-
        tory.)
        2.3.1.5.2. ART officers whose positions are canceled, downgraded by position classification
        action, etc. These are AFRC employees who have lost or will lose their positions/grades due
        to unit deactivations/conversions, change in aircrew composition, positions downgraded by
        classification action, etc.
        2.3.1.5.3. Competitive promotion candidates. These are current Air Force employees who are
        qualified, hold a lower civilian grade, are registered in the AOCMP, and are in the top 10 to 15
        available candidates on the promotion register for the unit where the position is located. Refer
        to chapter 3 for detailed procedures.
        2.3.1.5.4. Competitive reassignment/CLG candidates. These are current Air Force employees
        who are registered in the AOCMP and are in the top 10 to 15 available candidates on a com-
        petitive reassignment/CLG register. This register is normally used when the supervisor
        restructures a position to fill at a lower grade level because there are insufficient qualified pro-
        motion candidates at the full journeyman grade. Competitive selection means that promotion
        to the target grade level can be made without further competition when all qualification factors
        are met.
        2.3.1.5.5. Employee-requested reassignment/CLG candidates. These are current Air Force
        employees who are qualified, have the same or higher civilian grade, may be registered in the
        AOCMP, and have requested consideration in writing through appropriate channels. Further
        promotion requires competition.
        2.3.1.5.6. Reinstatement/transfer "status" candidates. Reinstatement candidates are fo rmer
        permanent federal employees who are qualified and have submitted an acceptable application
12                                                                       AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996

            and a copy of latest SF 50-B to HQ AFRC/DPCC, and who still have reinstatement eligibility.
            Transfer candidates are current permanent federal employees who are qualified and have sub-
            mitted an acceptable application and SF 50-B to HQ AFRC/DPCC. HQ AFRC/DPCC main-
            tains an ASF of their status applicants who meet criteria and reserve/military qualifications.
            The "recruitment list" for "status" applicants is all current and projected ART officer positions.
            Interested and qualified candidates should submit their application to HQ AFRC/DPCC.
            2.3.1.5.7. Management Directed Reassignment (MDR) candidates. These are current AFRC
            employees who are qualified, have the same civilian grade as the vacancy, and who manage-
            ment directs their reassignment to the vacancy. Such reassignments may be involuntary (that
            is, he or she has not agreed to the assignment. T he action may be effected under a mobility
            agreement.)
            2.3.1.5.8. Candidates referred from an SEU register. These are candidates who the SEU has
            rated as qualified, are identified as geographically available, are referred on a certificate, and
            who the selecting supervisor may select.
            2.3.1.5.9. VRA authority candidates. These are veterans who have applied for consideration.
            The VRA authority limits appointments up to the GS-11 level. Time limits (after separation
            from active duty) apply to all except disabled veterans. T he "recruitment list" is all ART
            officer positions which selecting supervisors may fill at the GS-11 level or below. Interested
            and qualified (military and civilian) candidates should submit application to HQ AFRC/DPCC
            and reference "VRA."
            2.3.1.5.10. Mandatory grade retention selectees.
               2.3.1.5.10.1. The local military personnel flight (MPF) determines if these candidates are
               militarily qualified (may need to coordinate with HQ AFRC/DPMO for colonels and
               above and HQ AFRC/DPMO for l ieutenant colonels and below). H Q AFRC/DPC is the
               approving authority for colonels and above (after coordination with HQ AFRC/DPMO).
               2.3.1.5.10.2. For lieutenant colonels and below, after coordination with the local MPF, the
               servicing CPO notifies HQ AFRC/DPCC of tentative selection, who may coordinate with
               HQ AFRC/DPMO.
        2.3.1.6. Consider temporary fill action. Pending permanent assignment of a new incumbent, the
        unit commander/supervisor may detail or temporarily promote to a vacant position, an employee
        who is qualified for the temporary promotion. This promotion would be non-competitive,
        not-to-exceed 120 days. Supervisors submit SF 52 to the servicing CPO for processing of tempo-
        rary assignment actions. HQ AFRC/DPCC approval is required if temporary promotion exceeds
        120 days. A person does not have to qualify militarily fo r temporary promotion or detail since
        these actions do not affect the employee’s reserve assignment.
        2.3.1.7. Comply with responsibilities outlined in chapter 3.
     2.3.2. Servicing CPOs:
        2.3.2.1. Upon receipt of an SF 52 to fill the vacancy, notify HQ AFRC/DPCC immediately by
        message, e-mail, Banyan Vines (send to: Name of personnelist@HQ_AFRC_DPC@ROBINS), or
        memorandum of all ART officer vacancies. Include:

        visor.
        2.3.2.1.7. Previous incumbent and reason why he or she vacated the position.
        2.3.2.1.8. Name and Defense System Network (DSN) number of the servicing CPO person-
        nelist point of contact.
        2.3.2.1.9. Name and DSN number of the selecting supervisor.
        2.3.2.1.10. A statement that the servicing CPO has cleared the vacancy from regulatory place-
        ment requirements of RIF, DoD PPP, Reemployment Priority List, etc., and that the servicing
        CPO will notify HQ AFRC/DPCC immediately if the status changes.
        2.3.2.1.11. Any special instructions such as name requests or earmarked name requests when
        requesting an SEU certificate. Name requests should include the social security number of the
        individual. Name requests are not appropriate for in-service competitive actions such as pro-
        motion, competitive reassignment, etc.
        2.3.2.1.12. The manpower ACN and/or approved AFRC Form 106 (or other official docu-
        ment) authorizing any changes in the UMD data of the position.
        2.3.2.1.13. The salary, including locality pay of the position, step 1, and step 10.
     2.3.2.2. Upon receipt of notification from HQ AFRC/DPCC that a selection has been approved,
     the servicing CPO:
        2.3.2.2.1. Contacts the selected applicant.
        2.3.2.2.2. Furnishes appropriate preemployment processing information forms, etc.
        2.3.2.2.3. Arranges reporting dates.
        2.3.2.2.4. Processes the action.
        2.3.2.2.5. Provides other normal staffing services.
     2.3.2.3. Refer on DD Form 359, Referral for Consideration, names of applicants and employees
     tentatively selected for all ART positions to the AFRC unit’s servicing MPF. This form includes:
        2.3.2.3.1. Position title, series, grade, and ART position number of the position for which
        selected.
        2.3.2.3.2. The signature of the selecting official.
        2.3.2.3.3. The proposed effective date of personnel action.
14                                                                      AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996

        2.3.2.4. Establish effective dates for placement into ART positions in conjunction with servicing
        MPF. The servicing CPO commits no job until the servicing MPF documents in writing that the
        applicant or employee meets all requirements (including military Air Force Specialty Code
        (AFSC)) for assignment to the Air Force Reserve position for which selected). The servicing CPO
        may not effect the civilian personnel action (including reassignments) until this documentation
        (reflecting the individual meets military qualifications) is on file in the servicing CPO. The ser-
        vicing CPO and servicing MPF accomplish the documentation on DD Form 359 as indicated
        above.
        2.3.2.5. The servicing CPO may not make any appointment or assignment to an ART position
        until the servicing MPF has appointed or assigned the applicant or employee to a comparable posi-
        tion in the AFRC unit. However, they may effect both actions on the same date. EXCEPTION:
        With prior approval from HQ AFRC/DPC, the servicing CPO may make a career-type appoint-
        ment to an ART position pending an AFRC appointment or assignment. Under these conditions,
        the applicants must certify in writing that they understand the AFRC unit will separate them from
        the civilian position because of military disqualification if they cannot be appointed or assigned to
        the reserve position.
        2.3.2.6. If not already on file, have the employee/selectee signs a completed AFRC Form 121,
        Mobility and Status Quo Placement Certificate of Understanding, before the effective date of
        the personnel action. File original in employee’s official personnel folder (OPF) and mail copy to
        HQ AFRC/DPCC.
        2.3.2.7. May voucher appropriate appointees and, upon receipt of any derogatory vouchers, notify
        HQ AFRC/DPCC.
        2.3.2.8. Notify HQ AFRC/DPCC by message/e-mail/etc., of the effective date of any ART officer
        assignment action (that is, promotion, appointment, reassignment, etc.). Inc lude the employee’s
        DSN number.
        2.3.2.9. When an ART officer enters on active duty (for example, 10 U.S.C. statutory tour), send
        a copy of SF 50-B, and, if available, a copy of the military orders to HQ AFRC/DPCC.
        2.3.2.10. Ensure t hat a ll ART o fficer da ta i s c urrent i n t he D CPDS. For e xample,
        ASG-CIV-ART-ID, DIN J5D must be code "P." (NOTE: The system may reject action if AFSC
        does not start with zero (0) for ART officer positions.)
        2.3.2.11. Before effecting the appointment, notify HQ AFRC/DPCC if any tentative preference
        selectees are ineligible for tentative preference. Their appointment may be illegal.
        2.3.2.12. Notify in advance, and provide copy of SF 50-B t o, HQ AFRC/DPCC on a ll ART
        officer personnel actions not approved in writing by HQ AFRC/DPCC (for example, Transfer of
        Function Placement, RIF Placement), and on others upon request.
     2.3.3. Gaining MPFs:
        2.3.3.1. Determine eligibility for reserve membership of each applicant and employee selected for
        placement in an ART position. This applies even though the employee may be currently serving
        in an ART position.
        2.3.3.2. If eligible for reserve membership, certify eligibility using DD Form 359 that the servic-
        ing CPO furnishes, and return it to the servicing CPO.
AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996                                                                              15

      2.3.3.3. Effect the reserve appointment or assignment before or concurrent with the civilian
      appointment or assignment, and notify the servicing CPO of any necessary delay.
   2.3.4. HQ AFRC/DPC:
      2.3.4.1. Maintain ART officer promotion and ASF registers (for e xample, VRA and status file),
      including those the CMB establishes/approves.
      2.3.4.2. Prepare and issue ASF, merit promotion and competitive/noncompetitive reassignment
      certificates to selecting officials in response to servicing CPO requests.
      2.3.4.3. Issue promotion announcements, as required.
      2.3.4.4. Prepare and maintain PEPs, and obtain PEP approval by the CMB chairperson.
      2.3.4.5. Process approval packages, notify affected units of a pproval or di sapproval of tentative
      selections, and furnish the servicing CPO with required data to process approved actions.
      2.3.4.6. Obtain and process OPM certificate of eligibles from the SEU.
          2.3.4.6.1. Conduct preliminary review of former and pres ent military status. Take action to
          remove applicants from appropriate registers/certificates if they are not militarily qualified and
          the selecting supervisor does not desire to request waivers or when waivers are not allowed.
          2.3.4.6.2. Determine availability of applicants.
          2.3.4.6.3. Refer applications to and obtain tentative selections from selecting officials.
      2.3.4.7. Arrange with the servicing CPO for accession or position change processing and provide
      the servicing CPO with necessary supporting documents, such as applications, etc.
      2.3.4.8. Maintain ART program vacancy listings as needed, and identify trends in ART program
      manning/recruitment.
      2.3.4.9. Monitor placement of ART officers (for example, positions canceled, restoration).
      2.3.4.10. May voucher appropriate appointees with results going directly to the servicing CPO.

2.4. Management Directed Reassignments (MDR)/Management Reassignment (MR). These terms
are used interchangeably and signify management initiated reassignments.
   2.4.1. Within Unit or Same NAF. The unit commander/senior ART officer/selecting supervisor hav-
   ing mutual chain of command/supervisory jurisdiction over both ART officer positions/vacancies may
   request HQ AFRC approval of an MDR or an employee requested CLG.
      2.4.1.1. The request must be by memorandum/message/e-mail and state what is proposed, giving
      full names, positions affected, civilian and military grades, ART position description numbers,
      FAC of positions affected, and impact on reserve assignments.
      2.4.1.2. The unit commander/senior ART officer/selecting supervisor sends the request to HQ
      AFRC/DPCC for approval processing, with an information copy to the requesting official’s higher
      headquarters, to include the NAF/CC. This allows ample time for higher level commanders to
      evaluate proposed changes and contact HQ AFRC/DPCC only if the action should not be pro-
      cessed.
16                                                                      AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996

        2.4.1.3. The unit, concurrently with step in paragraph 2.4.1.2, sends an SF 52 t o their servicing
        CPO who checks/clears their priorities (for example, "stopper list") and completes the proposed
        personnel actions upon receipt of the HQ AFRC approval.
        2.4.1.4. If unit commanders/senior ARTs do not have mutual jurisdiction, they can request an
        MDR as long as they obtain the concurrence of the appropriate supervisory channels and indicate
        this concurrence in the MDR request.
        2.4.1.5. If a supervisor, other than the unit commander/senior ART, requests an MDR, he or she
        must indicate that the unit commander/senior ART concurs in the request.
     2.4.2. Between NAFs. There is no single unit commander/senior ART officer who has mutual chain
     of command/supervisory jurisdiction below AFRC/CV level. Therefore, AFRC/CV or HQ AFRC/
     DPCC, as appropriate, approves requests for MDRs from the gaining unit commander, so long as both
     the gaining and losing NAF/CCs concur in the action. Include in the request the data listed in para-
     graph 2.4.1. In addition, upon AFRC approval, the gaining unit concurrently sends an SF 52 to its ser-
     vicing CPO who checks/clears the priorities (for example, "stopper list") and complete the proposed
     personnel actions.

2.5. Employee Requested Reassignments/ Change-to-Lower Grade (CLG):
     2.5.1. ART officers may submit requests in writing for re assignment or CL G consideration to posi-
     tions within or outside their current unit of assignment. Th e request must contain current position
     title, series, grade, DSN number, lowest acceptable grade, type of work or specific position in which
     interested, and reason for the request. Send the request through supervisory/command channels to
     HQ AFRC/DPCC.
     2.5.2. Unit commanders/supervisors/senior ARTs review reasons stated in the request and add com-
     ments, concurrences, or nonconcurrences. NAF/CC/senior ART may disapprove the request and
     return to the ART officer with reasons, or approve and forward the request to HQ AFRC/DPCC.
     2.5.3. Requests receiving the approval of t he NAF/CC remain in effect for a period of 1 ye ar from
     date of receipt in HQ AFRC/DPCC unless the employee withdraws the written request, declines con-
     sideration for a position, or accepts placement in a different type position. ART officers desiring fur-
     ther consideration at the end of 1 year initiate a new request.
     2.5.4. Selecting supervisors have the option of considering employees with an approved request for
     reassignment/CLG.

2.6. Rated ART Officer Assignment Criteria. The above guidance, relative to management directed
and employee requested reassignments and CLGs, applies to both nonrated and rated ART officer person-
nel. However, due to certain flying and aircraft qualification requirements, the following assignment cri-
teria applies to management directed and noncompetitive reassignments. They also apply to rated ART
officer assignments to positions which require flying or aircraft qualifications not possessed by the indi-
vidual at time of assignment. This criteria does not apply to noncompetitive details:
     2.6.1. Persons assigning into ART positions noncompetitively through in-service placement actions.
     They must meet the regular qualification standards for such positions. Exceptions are rated aircrew
     ARTs who AFRC may move noncompetitively to another rated aircrew ART position (even at another
     installation), having higher or different flying qualification requirements. Such employees are consid-
     ered qualified for promotion in the same line of work only after acquiring whatever flying experience
AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996                                                                              17

   the new position requires within the time limits prescribed by Air Force and AFRC regulations. How-
   ever, if a person is assigning into an Airplane Flight Instructor or Helicopter Flight Instructor, GS-13
   position, the ART officer must be currently instructor-pilot qualified in the unit aircraft where the
   vacancy exists. Only the gaining NAF/CC or above may approve exceptions to this requirement. In
   such cases the individual must meet reserve/military retainability requirements and meet all prerequi-
   sites for attendance at the training or transition course appropriate for the specific aircraft involved.
   2.6.2. New appointments. Supervisors normally fill rated positions at the full journeyman level.
   However, management may choose to fill a vacancy at a lower grade level. Applicants must meet all
   prerequisites for attendance at the training or transition course appropriate for the specific aircraft
   involved. All flying hour requirements must be met before the individual will be eligible for promo-
   tion.
   2.6.3. Unit aircraft conversions. The special aircrew qualification requirements for rated ART officer
   positions may dictate the establishment of separate competitive levels for positions requiring the per-
   formance of duty and/or mission qualifications in different types of aircraft. Accordingly, movement
   between positions during RIFs caused by a change in unit aircraft requires a qualification determina-
   tion before assignment to a position in a different competitive level. Examiner, instructor, or mission
   qualifications in more than one type aircraft simultaneously are the exception rather than the rule.
   Therefore, all employees normally fail to meet the special qualification requirements for assignment
   to a comparable position involving a different type aircraft. W hen such an employee is reached for
   RIF due to change in unit aircraft and does not meet minimum qualifications requirements, the
   employee will be accorded normal RIF outplacement entitlements. If the employee is currently an
   ART officer and meets all prerequisites for a ttendance at the training or t ransition course (including
   such things as military retainability), management has the option to select him or her for retraining to
   a comparable position in a different aircraft. Management computes retainability from official con-
   version date.

2.7. Placement of ART Officers Whose Positions Are Canceled. The servicing CPO administers offi-
cial placement programs. These include central skills bank, RIF, and the DoD PPP. As part of the provi-
sions of the AFRC AOCMP and to supplement RIF, PPP, and other no rmal placement programs
conducted by the servicing CPO, HQ AFRC/DPCC conducts informal placement efforts within the AFRC
command.
   2.7.1. Approximately 12 months before unit conversion or deactivation (or at the earliest known prac-
   tical date), HQ AFRC/DPCC may send the potentially displaced ART officer a memorandum/mes-
   sage/Banyan/e-mail notifying that they will be subject to placement in the first available vacancy at
   current, permanent grade level anywhere within AFRC. If he or she is unsuccessful in being placed at
   another location/position, local RIF applies. Local RIF could result in reassignment in grade, CLG, or
   separation according to governing regulations. If all the positions are not canceled, the lowest persons
   on the RIF retention register will be considered for command-wide placement. (NOTE: HQ AFRC/
   DPCC refers ARTs on military tour (whose position has been canceled) only during the 12 months
   prior to their date of separation.)
   2.7.2. HQ AFRC/DPCC assigns the displaced ART officer to the first ART vacancy at the same grade
   for which he or she qualifies. AFRC considers employee preferences to the maximum extent possible
   in keeping with command mission requirements and availability of vacancies; however, AFRC con-
   siders the needs of the service to be paramount in any placement action.
18                                                                     AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996

     2.7.3. Supervisors with vacancies normally select referred displacement ART officers unless there are
     valid reasons for nonselection. Supervisors coordinate proposed nonselections in writing through
     command channels to NAF/CC for approval.
     2.7.4. Employee may not decline position. Employee will be subject to separation if he or she refuses
     assignment.
     2.7.5. AFRC may implement mobility provisions of chapter 4 at any time.
     2.7.6. In processing and effecting local RIF, servicing CPOs conduct the RIF according to normal
     RIF regulations. The servicing CPO effects actions as soon as possible after the effective date of the
     conversion, deactivation, position cancellation, etc.
     2.7.7. With concurrence of the senior ART/unit commander, managers may allow waivers of civilian
     qualification requirements for positions at the individual’s location, according to governing regula-
     tions.
     2.7.8. Converting/deactivating units fill vacant positions on a temporary basis during the 12 months
     before the effective date. NAF/CC may approve exceptions.
     2.7.9. When more than one ART officer is qualified and available for the same vacancy, HQ AFRC/
     DPCC refers all, and the selecting supervisor may select any of those referred.

2.8. Placement of ART Officers from Key to Non-Key Positions. ART officers who request m ove-
ment into a non-key position sign an agreement stating: "As a condition of this voluntary assignment to a
non-key position I accept that I will be subject to separation from my air reserve technician (ART) posi-
tion, both civilian and reserve, upon reaching my mandatory separation date (M SD), whether my ART
position is a key or non-key position and whether or not I have received an offer."
AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996                                                                                 19

                                                 Chapter 3

                            ART OFFICER MERIT PROMOTION PLAN

3.1. General:
   3.1.1. This chapter serves as the merit promotion plan and outlines guidance and procedures used in
   filling ART officer positions by promotion or related personnel actions that could lead to promotion.
   3.1.2. Supervisors make selections based on merit and qualifications and without regard to race,
   color, religion, sex, age, national origin, marital status, political affiliation, nondisqualifying physical
   handicap, membership or nonmembership in an employee or ganization, personal favoritism, or any
   other nonmerit factor.

3.2. Responsibilities:
   3.2.1. Supervisors/unit commanders:
       3.2.1.1. Must uphold merit principles.
       3.2.1.2. Promptly release an employee selected for promotion normally within 30 calendar days
       after servicing CPO notifies the losing supervisor of selection. Notification may be verbal or writ-
       ten. In unusual circumstances, the gaining and losing supervisors may agree to extend the release
       date.
       3.2.1.3. Participate as needed in developing PEPs or determining qualification requirements,
       methods, and standards for selection to fill positions covered in this instruction.
       3.2.1.4. Have authority for tentative selection of candidates for vacant positions. (See chapter 2
       for final approval authority for selection.)
       3.2.1.5. May interview or contact promotion candidates as part of the selection process. Supervi-
       sors have a corollary obligation to notify the candidates after receipt of HQ AFRC notification of
       approval for a selection. This notification should include name of selectee and should express
       appreciation for the candidates’ interest.
       3.2.1.6. Upon receipt of a promotion or other competitive or noncompetitive assignment certifi-
       cate, complete and return the certificate to HQ AFRC/DPCC within 21 days from date of the cer-
       tificate. Request an extension from HQ AFRC/DPCC if unable to complete tentative selection by
       the expiration date shown on the certificate. Select from available candidates (from this or other
       sources) unless such circumstances exist that would justify a delay in filling the position on a per-
       manent basis.
       3.2.1.7. Ensure only qualified instructor/examiner pilots are assigned to Airplane Flight Instructor
       and Helicopter Flight Instructor, GS-13 positions. (See paragraph 2.6.1 for exceptions.)
   3.2.2. Employees desiring consideration for advancement:
       3.2.2.1. Pursue a program of self-development to prepare for advancement.
       3.2.2.2. Submit changes in or additions to experience, education, or training through their super-
       visor to the servicing CPO. ART officers should review their civilian career brief at least annually.
       3.2.2.3. Keep informed on career program instructions.
20                                                                      AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996

        3.2.2.4. Complete and keep AF Form 2675 up-to-date. Only those who complete this form and
        are registered in the AOCMP receive any promotion or competitive reassignment consideration
        for ART officer positions.
     3.2.3. HQ AFRC/DPC:
        3.2.3.1. Administer the ART officer merit promotion plan in conjunction with higher level guid-
        ance, other chapters of this instruction, and AFRC instructions.
        3.2.3.2. Maintain detailed PEPs and make them available for review by operating officials and
        employees upon request.
        3.2.3.3. Establish continuing and as-needed competitive registers of eligibles to be used in staff-
        ing ART officer vacancies. Establish/update continuing registers at least semiannually to permit
        entry of new employees.
        3.2.3.4. Upon request, inform employees of their record of experience which is used as a basis for
        qualification determinations.

3.3. Area of Consideration:
     3.3.1. The area of consideration for permanent promotion for all GS-15 and below ART officer posi-
     tions is all eligible registrants in the AOCMP.
     3.3.2. The area of consideration for ART temporary promotion is normally limited to eligibles in the
     commuting area.

3.4. Applicability of Competitive Process:
     3.4.1. Competition is normally according to higher level guidance. HQ AFRC/DPCC is responsible
     for determining if a personnel action for an ART officer position is subject to competition and the
     extent of competition. (Servicing CPO determines requirement for competition of temporary promo-
     tions of 120 days or less.)
     3.4.2. HQ AFRC/DPCC, following guidance of the AFRC CMB, determines each candidate’s basic
     eligibility and initially ranks eligibles to identify the best qualified. The progression level factors
     (PLF) normally identify the best qualified candidates. T he requirements for be ing a reserve officer
     severely limit the number of qualified candidates. Therefore, HQ AFRC/DPCC may refer and super-
     visors may select candidates below the best qualified level.
     3.4.3. HQ AFRC/DPCC may exclude employees encumbering formal trainee-type positions from
     competitive promotion consideration, up to, and including, the target grade level of the program in
     which enrolled.

3.5. Details:
     3.5.1. When the detail is for m ore than 120 days and the assignment is such that the employee can
     perform the majority of the higher level duties, the servicing CPO, in conjunction with HQ AFRC/
     DPCC, applies appropriate competitive procedures.
     3.5.2. The area of consideration to be used for competitive details is the major organization in which
     the higher grade position is located.
AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996                                                                            21

   3.5.3. Competition is not required for a detail of 120 days or less to a higher grade position.
   3.5.4. The detail of an ART does not affect the employee’s reserve assignment.

3.6. Temporary Promotions:
   3.6.1. The same experience, qualification requirements, etc., apply to temporary promotions as apply
   to permanent promotions. A FRC applies competitive procedures as appropriate when selecting
   employees for temporary promotion.
   3.6.2. The area of consideration to be used for competitive temporary promotions is the major organi-
   zation in which the higher grade position is located.
   3.6.3. For ART officer vacancies, an employee of an Air Force activity serviced by a nother CPO is
   not normally considered for a temporary promotion unless the two activities are within commuting
   distance.
   3.6.4. In processing a temporary promotion, the selected employee should be informed of the tempo-
   rary nature of the promotion and related conditions, including contemplated return to his or her former
   position or to another position at the same grade as h is or her position. Th e employee accepts or
   declines in writing. A declination does not affect an employee’s eligibility for consideration for pro-
   motion to other positions.
   3.6.5. An employee serving on a temporary promotion continues to receive consideration for perma-
   nent promotion to all positions for which qualified above his or her permanent grade level.
   3.6.6. The employee competes in a RIF as if he or she were still serving in his or her permanent posi-
   tion.
   3.6.7. Servicing CPOs and HQ AFRC/DPCC count service under a temporary promotion the same as
   for any other service. The temporary promotion does not make the employee eligible for pay reten-
   tion or adjustment, or noncompetitive repromotion.
   3.6.8. The temporary promotion of an ART does not affect the employee’s reserve assignment.
   3.6.9. Upon termination of a temporary promotion, the employee normally returns to his or her per-
   manent position.
   3.6.10. A supervisor may request temporary promotion or detail to backfill a vacancy created by tem-
   porary promotion or detail. If a supervisor establishes a non-ART position against the ART authoriza-
   tion, he or she may request fill action by temporary appointment.

3.7. Methods of Locating Candidates:
   3.7.1. The current method of locating candidates for consideration for competitive referral is the Pro-
   motions and Placements Referral System (PPRS). PPRS is an automated referral capability available
   through the DCPDS. When developing a promotion/competitive reassignment certificate, AFRC con-
   siders only candidates registered in the AFRC AOCMP. AFRC normally considers individuals regis-
   tered in the AOCMP, regardless of geographic availability. Since AFRC may make case-by-case
   exceptions (for example, for new unit aircraft), registrants should register for appropriate geographic
   locations.
22                                                                        AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996

     3.7.2. AFRC considers all employees within the area of c onsideration for initial basic eligibility
     determinations. When an announcement is used, HQ AFRC/DPCC limits consideration to those who
     have applied through the specific announcement whether or not PPRS was used.
     3.7.3. AFRC may consider former civilian federal employees eligible for reinstatement or employees
     of another federal agency (including transfer candidates) with competing Air Force employees for a
     position of higher grade (or one with promotion potential to a higher grade) than the one presently
     held. To the extent possible, AFRC evaluates these candidates against the same criteria specified in
     the PEP for competing Air Force employees. Selection of candidates is tentative pending HQ AFRC/
     DPCC approval.
     3.7.4. The selecting supervisor may also consider applicants certified from OPM registers. T he
     selection process in chapter 2 applies. Servicing CPOs may effect appointment with no break in ser-
     vice for candidates certified from OPM registers who currently occupy ART positions.
     3.7.5. Employees absent in military service:
        3.7.5.1. A vital element in the career progression of ART officers is a limited, active duty statu-
        tory assignment. A FRC encourages ART officers to plan for such a to ur and to actively seek
        selection as opportunities become available. ARTs entering on active duty tours do so to fill a crit-
        ical military requirement. Title 38, U .S.C. Chapter 43; Title 5, U.S.C. 3551; and the Uniformed
        Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994 (Public Law 103-353),
        October 13, 1994, guarantee restoration rights of such individuals. A FRC considers an ART
        officer absent on military duty in absentia for in-service promotion under AOCMP as though still
        present. Servicing CPOs and HQ AFRC/DPCC credit experience gained while in military service
        that is creditable for veterans preference or which is the basis for restoration, either as an extension
        of the work the individual was doing immediately before entry into the armed forces, or on its own
        merits, whichever is more beneficial to the individual.
            3.7.5.1.1. The servicing CPO and HQ AFRC/DPCC do not normally give credit for actual
            duties performed until the employee returns from the tour and describes duties performed.
        3.7.5.2. HQ AFRC/DPCC evaluates and ranks ART officers considered in absentia by t he same
        methods as other competitors. If classification action u pgrades the pos ition, the servicing CPO
        considers/promotes the employee as if still assigned in the position. Management normally pro-
        motes the absent employee in a cla ssification upgrade unless the unit commander indicates in
        writing that he or she is not to be promoted. If statutory tour employee is within reach for selec-
        tion for competitive promotion, HQ AFRC/DPCC refers his or her name. If the supervisor selects
        the absent employee for promotion in absentia, the SF 52 indicates that he or she is absent for rea-
        sons stated. The SF 52 reflects the date the servicing CPO approves the action as the effective
        date. Wh en the employee restores to duty, the servicing CPO produces SF 50-Bs or enters the
        action into the appropriate DCPDS record and places the SF 52 in the OPF for use in effecting the
        action. The servicing CPO maintains records supporting the certification and selection like other
        promotion actions. If the employee fails to restore, the servicing CPO processes a termination/
        separation SF 50-B, as appropriate, with an effective date of the date he or she separated to enter
        military service.
        3.7.5.3. For the ART officer promoted while absent, the servicing CPO counts all the time follow-
        ing promotion as service in the higher grade, for purposes of meeting experience and other
        requirements to which promoted. Since the returning ART officer is subject to command-wide
AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996                                                                               23

       mobility requirements of the AOCMP, and since restoration rights are agency/AF-wide, AFRC
       may restore the ART anywhere in AFRC. ( NOTE: R estoration rights are covered under
       USERRA and AFRCI 36-114, Procedures on Air Reserve Technicians (ART) Who Lose Active
       Reserve Membership.)
       3.7.5.4. For ART officer promotion registers, HQ AFRC/DPCC extends the civilian performance
       appraisals in effect when an ART officer enters military service to the end of the tour.
   3.7.6. HQ AFRC/DPCC may exclude employees from promotion consideration when they:
       3.7.6.1. Apply after the closing date specified in an announcement.
       3.7.6.2. Enter on the rolls or acquire eligibility (or those with newly acquired qualifications) after
       establishment of the promotion register until the next regular updating of the register.
       3.7.6.3. Are on leave without pay and not expected to return to duty.
       3.7.6.4. Are on leave or leave without pay for 6 months or longer (except those absent for military
       duty or compensable injury) even though they are expected to return to duty.
       3.7.6.5. Are newly entered on duty and the necessary qualifications and evaluation data are not
       available for ranking purposes. HQ AFRC/DPCC may temporarily exclude them from consider-
       ation pending acquisition of such data. In no case may HQ AFRC/DPCC deny promotion consid-
       eration of an employee for longer than 3 months.
       3.7.6.6. Are not registered in the AFRC AOCMP.
       3.7.6.7. Are within 90 days after competitive appointment.

3.8. Promotion Evaluation Patterns (PEP):
   3.8.1. HQ AFRC/DPCC develops the PEP as a result of selection-oriented job analysis which identi-
   fies the KSAs required for future successful job performance.
   3.8.2. The process establishes a documented, direct relationship between job requirements and KSAs.
   3.8.3. HQ AFRC/DPCC provides employees with PEPs upon request so they can determine how to
   obtain additional experience and development. This may improve their opportunities for career pro-
   gression and foster a better understanding of the AOCMP evaluation criteria used in the career man-
   agement process.

3.9. Basic Eligibility Determination. Candidates must meet the minimum screening factors for the posi-
tion being filled. Those who meet the screening requirements are at least minimally qualified and eligible
for further evaluation and ranking against factors in the PEP for the position. Higher level guidance nor-
mally limits basic eligibility qualification requirements to those specified in the minimum standards that
OPM establishes or authorizes.

3.10. Evaluating Eligible Candidates:
   3.10.1. The PEP uses valid, job-related, evaluation criteria that go beyond the minimum qualification
   requirements to rank basically eligible employees in best-qualified order. T hese criteria are PLF
   which measure and compare the scope, quality, pertinency, quantity, etc., of an employee’s civilian
24                                                                      AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996

     and military work experience, education, and/or training related to the requirements of the position
     being filled.
     3.10.2. The PEP/PPRS uses only information in the employee’s master record DCPDS before the date
     of the computer listing to establish the promotion register. The PEP/PPRS matches data in the master
     record against ranking criteria specified in the PEP and ranks each employee in order of qualification.
     3.10.3. PPRS processing may encompass several progression levels which will permit meaningful
     distinctions between experience of competing employees.
     3.10.4. Sort-priority processing. After PPRS eligible employees are processed through prescribed
     PLFs, sort-priorities or tie breakers are applied to determine the rank order of competing employees
     within each PLF. The sort-priorities are:
        3.10.4.1. The first sort-priority is the current appraisal score in the employee’s master record at
        the time of ranking.
        3.10.4.2. RIF civilian service computation date is the final ranking tie-breaker.
        3.10.4.3. Selecting supervisors should also review awards data on each certified eligible to deter-
        mine rank priority.

3.11. Selective Certification for Competitive and Non-Competitive Consider ation. In i dentifying
eligibles for promotion, competitive reassignment or other assignment action, AFRC/CV and/or the CMB
authorize use of basic and additional job-related flying and military qualification criteria to screen
employee experience. Before requesting competitive action, the servicing CPO conducts required prior-
ity review (for example, local grade retention eligibles) using the selective factors listed below. HQ
AFRC/DPCC then uses these factors to identify eligibles for referral/consideration/ certification. O nly
those meeting these requirements are eligible. (For rated positions, permanently grounded personnel are
ineligible for referral) (NOTE: AFRC/CV and/or the CMB may approve other job-related selective cer-
tification (or ranking) factors as deemed appropriate.) Selective factors include:
     3.11.1. Military qualification for reserve assignment to the ART position. For ART officer positions
     with authorized counterpart military reserve grades of colonel or above, HQ AFRC/DPCC does not
     certify/refer/consider employees who are more than one grade below the authorized grade of t he
     reserve position. This includes officially announced selectees for military promotion. There is no
     selective certification below colonel (O-6) level based on military rank.
     3.11.2. Navigator and other nonpilot-rated (hereafter referred to as navigator) eligibles may not be
     certified for positions in units where a navigator is not authorized as part of the normal unit aircrew.
     3.11.3. After screening candidates using above two factors, the following factors apply:
        3.11.3.1. Geographic availability as reflected on AF Form 2675 (upon request).
        3.11.3.2. Trainees who have attained their trainee target grade for all vacancies for which quali-
        fied regardless of geographic availability. They are normally referred prior to promotion or SEU
        candidates.
        3.11.3.3. Refer eligibles for GS-15 rated positions by e ither fighter or m ulti-place qualifications
        (without regard to recency), as appropriate for the vacancy being filled (per CMB, September
        1996). However, the eligible must be aircraft rated and on flying status within the past 60 months
AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996                                                                              25

      from the date HQ AFRC/DPCC establishes the promotion register (or for servicing CPO date of
      referral).
      3.11.3.4. Refer eligibles for GS-14 rated positions by AFRC mission qualification; that is, fighter,
      airlift, or helicopter, in which the individual is or was qualified within the past 60 months from the
      date HQ AFRC/DPCC establishes the promotion register (or for s ervicing CPO date of referral).
      AFRC/CV/CMB determined that referral for new missions, such as bomber, includes other appro-
      priate missions (for example, airlift, fighter) until AFRC/CV or the CMB determines it can be lim-
      ited to the new mission.
      3.11.3.5. For all other positions requiring unit aircraft/MDS qualifications, only unit aircraft/
      MDS qualified eligibles within the past 60 months from the date HQ AFRC/DPCC establishes the
      promotion register. At management’s option, AFRC/DPCC may refer as best qualified, employ-
      ees for GS-12 rated positions who have experience in the unit aircraft.
      3.11.3.6. Eligibles for Airplane Flight Instructor and Helicopter Flight Instructor, GS-13 positions
      in the unit aircraft/MDS who are instructor qualified within the past 60 months.
      3.11.3.7. Eligibles for Aircraft Operations Officer, GS-14 positions at NAF level and Operations
      Group Commander at units with more than one type of aircraft who are currently qualified in any
      type subordinate mission. HQ AFRC/DPCC normally refers navigators only if there are ART
      navigators authorized as part of the normal unit aircrew within the subordinate units. Due to spe-
      cial/unique requirements of these NAF positions, NAF/CC/senior ART may approve limiting con-
      sideration to pilots and navigators of specific mission (for example, fighter pilots, airlift
      navigators, or helicopter/airlift pilots or navigators).
      3.11.3.8. Eligibles for Aircraft Operations Officer, GS-13 positions at NAF level who are cu r-
      rently qualified in any type aircraft in the NAF. HQ AFRC/DPCC refers navigators only if there
      are navigators authorized as part of the normal unit aircrew within the NAF units. Due to special/
      unique requirements of these positions, NAF/CC/senior ART may approve limiting consideration
      to pilots and navigators of specific aircraft (for example, C-130 navigators, F-16/A-10 pilots,
      KC-135/KC-10 pilots or navigators, and helicopter/airlift pilots or navigators).
      3.11.3.9. Eligibles for Aircraft Operations Officer, GS-13 positions at unit level, candidates must
      be currently qualified in unit equipped aircraft. Refer unit equipped aircraft navigators only if
      there are navigators authorized as part of the normal unit aircrew.
   3.11.4. AFRC policy is that navigator employees may not occupy both ART officer positions of Air-
   craft Operations Officer/Deputy Air Commander (Operations Group Commander) and Air Com-
   mander at group or wing level at the same time. In units where navigators serve as aircrew members,
   HQ AFRC/DPCC (or for local priority referral, the servicing CPO) certifies both pilot and navigator
   employees for Air Commander vacancies only. I f the unit commander/senior ART is a p ilot, HQ
   AFRC/DPCC (or the servicing CPO) refers both pilot and navigator employees for Aircraft Opera-
   tions Officer (Operations Group Commander) vacancies at group or wing level. If the unit com-
   mander/senior ART is a navigator employee, HQ AFRC/DPCC refers only employees who are
   pilot-rated. This paragraph applies to all wings, groups, and non-collocated squadrons (for example,
   305 RQS) which are similar to wings.

3.12. Promotion Registers and Certificates:
26                                                                       AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996

     3.12.1. A competitive promotion register is a listing of qualified competitors, in rank order, from
     which eligibles are certified for promotion consideration. (NOTE: Before a competitive certificate is
     issued, HQ AFRC/DPCC normally issues a listing of surplus ART officers (if any) (see paragraph 2.7)
     and, subsequently, ART officer grade retention eligibles (if any) (see paragraph 3.15.4)). HQ AFRC/
     DPCC may establish registers for up t o 1 ye ar, subject to semiannual or e arlier scheduled updating.
     Except for t hese scheduled updates, HQ AFRC does not add additional names to a register until the
     end of the period for which HQ AFRC/DPCC established the register. T he only exceptions to this
     requirement are the correction of administrative error which resulted in the omission of a qualified eli-
     gible or when less than 10 qualified eligibles are available for certification. HQ AFRC/DPCC nor-
     mally refers employees from the register in regular rank order for all positions covered by the register.
     When justified, however, HQ AFRC/DPCC may use selective certification from a register to compile
     promotion certificates based on specialized job requirements as outlined in paragraph 3.11.
     3.12.2. A promotion certificate is the listing in alphabetical order of t he names of those candidates
     who are within reach on the register for referral to the selecting official. HQ AFRC/DPCC may use
     AFRC Form 157 to certify candidates. This certificate normally contains the names of the top 10
     available candidates and not more than 15 if ties exist within a PLF (absent sort priority processing) of
     the 10 certified eligibles. For example, if #12 is in PLF 1-4 and #13 is in PLF 1-3, HQ AFRC/DPCC
     certifies #12 but not #13. Conversely, if #10 through #15 are all in PLF 1-3, then HQ AFRC/DPCC
     certifies 15 candidates. HQ AFRC/DPCC certifies one additional name for each additional vacancy.
     If two or more supervisors request certification for identical positions at the same time, HQ AFRC/
     DPCC certifies the same available eligibles to each supervisor. Selecting officials normally complete
     and return certificates to HQ AFRC/DPCC not later than 21 calendar days from date of the certificate.
     3.12.3. HQ AFRC/DPCC provides selecting supervisors with a supplemental profile or career brief of
     information available in the system for each candidate listed on the promotion certificate. These pro-
     files/briefs contain information such as: experience, formal education background, performance rat-
     ings, reserve MSD, and other information pertinent to selection for promotion.
     3.12.4. In addition to review of the supplemental profile/brief, selecting officials may want to contact
     the supervisor of each candidate to obtain additional information on the employee’s KSAs considered
     pertinent to the requirements of the position.
     3.12.5. If an individual declines a promotion after being selected, HQ AFRC/DPCC will not certify
     his or her name again for any promotion opportunity for 1 year.
     3.12.6. For colonel (O-6) vacancies, upon request by the selecting supervisor, HQ AFRC/DPCC may
     refer (along with promotion certificate) all ART officers who are qualified for civilian reassignment
     (that is, same civilian grade) and who are lieutenant colonel selectees or lieutenant colonels. Individ-
     uals do not need to request reassignment as normally required by chapter 2. HQ AFRC/DPCC does
     not normally refer personnel already occupying O-6 positions at these organizational levels or higher
     unless a request for reassignment is on file (for example, NAF/DO is not normally referred to an oper-
     ations group commander vacancy). If t he selecting supervisor requests a listing, HQ AFRC/DPCC
     refers all eligible ART officers who are on O-5 authorizations (or below), regardless of organizational
     assignment.

3.13. Selection From Promotion Certificate:
AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996                                                                             27

   3.13.1. The selecting supervisor may select any candidate on the certificate. However, if the selectee
   has a current DD Form 1618, DoD Transportation Agreement-Transportation of Civilian Employees
   To and Within Continental United States, as a result of a PCS within the past 12 months, AFRC/CS or
   his or her designee (that is, HQ AFRC/DPC) approves or disapproves the one-year waiver of the lim-
   itation of more than one PCS move within a 12 month period.
   3.13.2. The gaining unit pays PCS costs according to provisions of the JTR, volume 2.
   3.13.3. HQ USAF/RE or AFRC/CV is the selecting official for Senior Executive Service and GS-15
   level ART officer positions. A FRC/CV may designate the NAF/CC as the selecting supervisor for
   GS-15 level positions. Supervisors and personnelists may fax certificates in unusual situations.

3.14. Interviewing Candidates:
   3.14.1. Higher level guidance/instruction does not require the selecting supervisor to interview candi-
   dates; however, local policies may apply. If t he supervisor interviews one candidate, he or she must
   interview all. If conducted, interviews may be by telephone when face-to-face interviews are not
   practical. A selection should not be delayed due to the unavailability of a candidate for interview
   within a r easonable amount of time. S upervisors should not expect candidates at other geographic
   locations to undergo personal hardship to be interviewed for a p osition. If the selecting supervisor
   decides to conduct selection or ranking interviews, he or she must apply only appropriate, job-related
   criteria in evaluating promotion candidates to differentiate among their qualifications and to identify
   those best qualified for advancement. When used, the selection or ranking interviews should assess
   job-related KSAs and personal characteristics important in predicting future job success. Supervisors
   must ask all candidates the same job-related questions and document results.
   3.14.2. In lieu of an official interview, supervisors may use the "exchange of information" discussion
   which limits discussion to the job duties, work schedules, temporary duty requirements, and other fac-
   tual matters relating to the vacancy. In these situations, it is most common to conduct these exchanges
   of factual information over the telephone or in other totally informal situations. M ost likely,
   face-to-face situations are not necessary and could be otherwise improperly construed as an actual
   ranking or selection interview.
   3.14.3. Supervisors may use ranking interviews in combination with other factors to determine the
   final ranking of candidates before referral. Panels of qualified subject-matter experts, at or above the
   grade of the vacancy, normally conduct ranking interviews.
   3.14.4. The selection interviews provide the selecting official with additional information upon which
   to base the selection decision. Supervisors may only use questions which relate to the KSAs identi-
   fied in the job analysis. Supervisors/panel members must summarize and document the selection
   interview proceedings and submit the results to HQ AFRC/DPCC. The selecting official records the
   number of candidates interviewed. If l ess than all candidates are interviewed, the official enters the
   names of those not interviewed and the substantiating reasons for not interviewing. The selecting
   official lists the questions which have been asked of all interviewees, records the names of the select-
   ees. He or she also signs and dates this record of the interview and submits it, together with any other
   pertinent documents, to HQ AFRC/DPCC for retention and disposition.
   3.14.5. Selecting supervisors should document the job-relatedness of both the ranking and selecting
   interviews. They should identify levels of possession of each KSA, using behavioral examples which
   correspond to an adjective scale and definitions/anchors with accompanying numerical (point) values.
28                                                                      AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996

     An example of an objective scale is: OUTSTANDING, SATISFACTORY, BARELY ACCEPTABLE,
     and UNACCEPTABLE. These anchors or descriptions are used to establish a rating scale as a frame
     of reference for objectively evaluating each candidate’s possession of the KSAs.

3.15. Promotions Not Subject to Competition:
     3.15.1. Career Promotions. As with other civil service positions, higher level guidance does not
     require competition for certain ART officer promotions (for example, previously competed for the tar-
     get position, career promotion, classification of position to a higher grade, repromotion of previously
     downgraded employees who held higher grade on a permanent basis). AFRC may use these excep-
     tions in conformance with higher level guidance.
     3.15.2. The servicing CPO or HQ AFRC/DPCC refers employees who are identified to receive prior-
     ity consideration in the order specified by higher guidance and limits consideration to positions within
     the employee’s current commuting area. Employees whose pay retention has expired are not eligible
     for priority consideration.
     3.15.3. HQ AFRC/DPCC may refer and supervisors may noncompetitively repromote/assign
     employees who previously had a permanent assignment to a p ermanent higher civilian grade or an
     intervening grade at any location. Supervisors forward tentative selections to HQ AFRC/DPCC for
     approval/disapproval processing. Selections are not mandatory unless on grade retention under the
     DoD PPP grade retention program "R" in the geographic area where the vacancy exists.

3.16. Keeping Employees Informed:
     3.16.1. When announcing specific vacancies which require employees to apply for consideration, HQ
     AFRC/DPCC rates applicants as either eligible or ineligible and notifies them of their rating.
     3.16.2. Supervisors should periodically advise their employees of their obligation to update their
     experience record by entering any data which would serve to enhance qualifications for future job
     placements.
     3.16.3. HQ AFRC/DPCC maintains information relative to requirements and makes the information
     available for review by employees and supervisors upon request.

3.17. Recommendations and Complaints:
     3.17.1. Employees and supervisors may ma ke recommendations on this instruction in writing
     through employee’s supervisory chain of command to HQ AFRC/DPCC.
     3.17.2. In an effort to obtain informal resolution, employees who have documentation showing incor-
     rect promotion consideration should discuss their concerns initially with their supervisor and HQ
     AFRC/DPCC. AFRC processes formal complaints under appropriate Air Force procedures.

3.18. Safeguarding Records. HQ AFRC/DPCC, servicing CPOs, and supervisors disclose and protect
records (for example, career briefs, promotion date) under provisions of appropriate guidance.
AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996                                                                             29

                                                Chapter 4

                           MOBILITY PROGRAM FOR ART OFFICERS

4.1. General. The need for flexibility of ART officer personnel in the ART program is paramount. This
provides for effective career management and ensures availability of highly qualified personnel for
assignments as required to meet the needs of the ART program. Mobility of ART officer personnel is in
the best interest of the Air Force and may, therefore, override personal considerations of employees where
required by the needs of the Air Force or AFRC.

4.2. Mobility Requirement. To be eligible for assignment to ART officer positions, applicants and
employees must accept AFRC-wide geographic mobility as a condition of their employment. Refusal to
accept this condition of employment serves as a basis for nonselection. Failure to meet this condition of
employment by refusing to accept a mandatory assignment serves as a basis for separation. This require-
ment applies to ART officer employees who accepted their current position with a mobility provision and
those who, in the future, voluntarily enter the mobility program by executing the required mobility certif-
icate. This condition of employment is in addition to other requirements and conditions of ART employ-
ment (for example, maintaining active reserve eligibility).

4.3. Categories of ART Officers. As related to the mobility program, there are two categories of ART
officer employees. Each category is involved in the mobility program in a different manner, depending on
when employed and which mobility certificate they signed. Categories are:
   4.3.1. ART officers who elected to participate in the mobility program before 9 February 1979, and
   signed AFRC Form 58, Mobility Certificate (obsolete form). T his form re quired mobility to other
   ART positions.
   4.3.2. ART officers who elected to participate in the mobility program beginning 9 F ebruary 1979,
   and signed AFRC Form 121, Mobility and Status Quo Placement Certificate of Understanding.
   This form applies to all employees who are initially assigned to nontemporary ART officer positions,
   to all officers accepting voluntary position changes to other ART officer positions, and to all ART
   officers requesting an extension to their reserve MSD. (See AFRCI 36-201.) On 9 February 1979, HQ
   AFRC/DP notified all command organizations and servicing CPOs that AFRC had made a change in
   the mobility program requirements. All subsequent ART officer appointees and current ART officers
   accepting voluntary position change were required to sign the new mobility certificate incorporating
   changes agreed to by the OPM. For employees facing status quo, the new mobility criteria requires
   mandatory outplacement referral to non-ART positions at the same or lower grade at any continental
   United States Air Force activity under the provisions of the DoD PPP.

4.4. Procedures:
   4.4.1. HQ AFRC coordinates new assignments with employees through their servicing CPOs. AFRC
   may honor employee desires as to geographical location, but only to the extent that the needs of the
   service permit. AFRC may consider individual preferences and personal circumstances before man-
   datory application of this plan.
30                                                                    AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996

     4.4.2. Management takes action on ART officers who lose their reserve membership in accordance
     with AFRCI 36-114, Procedures on Air Reserve Technicians (ART) Who Lose Active Reserve Mem-
     bership.
     4.4.3. AFRC makes assignments to different geographical locations under the requirement in para-
     graph 4.2 on a permanent basis.
     4.4.4. AFRC makes geographical movements for the convenience of AFRC and supports payment of
     all allowable costs according to the JTR, volume 2.
     4.4.5. AFRC applies the provisions of the ART Officer Merit Promotion Plan (chapter 3) in selecting
     employees for mobility assignments involving promotion.

4.5. Responsibilities:
     4.5.1. Management officials and supervisors:
        4.5.1.1. Promote understanding and acceptance of the purpose and intent of the mobility program.
        4.5.1.2. Should inform each ART officer applicant and employee of the mobility condition of
        employment.
     4.5.2. Servicing CPOs:
        4.5.2.1. Ensure that employees entering A RT officer positions, whether through initial a ppoint-
        ment or position change (promotion, reassignment, or demotion), are aware of the mobility provi-
        sions.
        4.5.2.2. Counsel employees occupying or being changed to positions covered by this plan.
        4.5.2.3. Obtain a signed AFRC Form 121 in triplicate from each individual upon initial entry into
        an ART officer position, and as needed, upon any position change mo ving an employee f rom a
        non-ART to an ART officer position. The servicing CPO furnishes the original to the employee,
        one copy to HQ AFRC/DPCC, and one copy to the employee’s OPF. A subsequent position
        change between ART officer positions does not require the completion of another AFRC Form
        121; however, in each case the servicing CPO must verify the existence of a signed AFRC Form
        121 in the employee’s OPF. When the position change involves a PCS, the gaining CPO verifies
        the existence of a completed AFRC Form 121 before consummating the personnel action.
        4.5.2.4. Include the following in item 30 of SF 50-B: "Your assignment to this position is subject
        to command-wide geographic mobility-AFRC Form 121, Mobility and Status Quo Placement
        Certificate of Understanding, dated ___________________________."
     4.5.3. ART officer employees:
        4.5.3.1. When accomplishing short-and long-range career planning, consider positions in the total
        ART structure, including active duty statutory tour assignments to positions that would broaden/
        enhance their ART careers. This applies especially to ART officer employees aspiring to occupy
        higher level ART positions. ART officer employees should make themselves available for ge o-
        graphical reassignments and promotions to ART positions for which they are highly qualified, to
        which they can contribute their greatest in meeting the current and long-range AFRC needs. Geo-
        graphic reassignments and promotions provide experience and training necessary for furt her
        development and assignment.

     4.5.3.2. Sign a certificate establishing mobility as a condition of employment. Upon execution of
     the mobility certificate, employees are subject to mobility as a condition of employment until they
     are changed to a non-ART position.
     4.5.3.3. Must be available for movement within a reasonable period of time (normally 30-60
     days) following notification of assignment.
     4.5.3.4. Review this instruction and provide, through supervisory channels, recommendations for
     ART career program improvements.

                                ART OFFICER TRAINEE PROGRAMS

5.1. General:
     5.1.1. AFRC has developed trainee programs in order to develop selectees into highly qualified ART
     officers in appropriate functional areas. These programs are expected to provide a reservoir of person-
     nel for future assignments to journeyman positions within AFRC. These programs are not accelerated
     promotion plans. Trainee programs include Military Personnel Officer (MPO), Logistics Manage-
     ment-Plans (LM), Airplane Pilot (AP), Airplane Pilot-PALACE ACQUIRE (PAQ), Public Affairs
     (PA), and Aircraft Maintenance Officer (MO). ( NOTE: T he AFRC Job Enrichment Program, a
     26-week rotational training program, is published in the ART Officer Training Guide and is not
     addressed in this instruction.)
     5.1.2. Upon successful completion of training, as appropriate, individual competes under merit pro-
     motion procedures for assignment to any appropriate vacant ART officer journeyman position within
     AFRC (military grade dependent upon Unit Manpower Document (UMD)). Q ualified trainees are
     referred/assigned regardless of geographic preference.
     5.1.3. These positions are designated as formal trainee positions for RIF purposes.
     5.1.4. Trainees sign AFRC Form 121 and are subject to the provisions of o ther chapters of this
     instruction.
     5.1.5. Selectees complete a 1-to-3 year training period depending on entry grade level and program.
     Units may request exception to the length of t raining to meet the needs of t he service and when the
     employee is fully qualified, meets the time-in-grade, and any other requirements, as appropriate (for
     example, flying hour requirements contained in FPM Supplement (Internal) 930-71). Circumstances
     warranting the exception must be fully documented and approved by the NAF/CC and HQ AFRC
     functional area.
     5.1.6. Trainees are subject to formal evaluation and counseling as required. Some trainees may not
     achieve "satisfactory completion" in the minimum periods specified due to individual differences in
     ability. When progress is less than satisfactory, supervisors inform trainee, provide guidance for
     improvement, and assist in achieving satisfactory performance. Under such conditions, AFRC delays
     eligibility for promotion (if appropriate) until satisfactory completion of the required training. A
     trainee who continues to fail to meet requirements or becomes dissatisfied with the program may be
     reassigned to a non-trainee position for which qualified or become subject to separation.
     5.1.7. AFRC will not consider trainees for c ompetitive assignment to positions outside their trainee
     program at the target grade or below.

5.2. Responsibilities. The appropriate functional office in HQ AFRC, NAF, unit, and trainee is responsi-
ble for, and the HQ AFRC Director of Civilian Personnel (DPC) assists in, accomplishing the duties listed
below.
     5.2.1. Publicize the training programs (the offices of primary responsibility are HQ AFRC, NAF,
     unit).
AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996                                                                              33

  5.2.2. Announce, evaluate, and rank potential candidates (including current federal civil service
  employees) (HQ AFRC/DPC Special Examining Unit (SEU), HQ AFRC/DPC).
  5.2.3. Identify units where trainee overhire positions are to be established. Positions are assigned on
  an as-needed or priority basis. Advise wings when a position is available (HQ AFRC functional area,
  NAF).
  5.2.4. Ensure manpower change requests are accomplished and submitted to HQ AFRC/XPM to
  establish, cancel, or e xtend overhire positions as situations dictate (NAF, unit). S upervisor submits
  appropriate SF 52 to servicing CPO.
  5.2.5. Evaluate candidates and make tentative selections for entry into the training program (unit).
  5.2.6. Coordinate on final selection and relocation of trainees (HQ AFRC functional area for MPO,
  LM, PA, MO).
  5.2.7. Approve unit/CC’s tentative selection of trainee for entry into the program before the unit/CC
  forwards selection to HQ AFRC/DPCC for final appointment approval processing (NAF).
  5.2.8. Develop and maintain training course outline and monitor progress of trainees (HQ AFRC
  functional area, NAF, unit).
  5.2.9. Furnish a copy of this chapter of the instruction and appropriate training plan to each trainee at
  the time of assignment (unit).
  5.2.10. Ensure trainees are scheduled to attend ART Officer Orientation (NAF, unit).
  5.2.11. Ensure class quotas are obtained for formal schools when required (for PA, Defense Informa-
  tion School (DINFOS) PA Officer Course; LM, Logistics Plans Officer Course; MO, Aircraft Main-
  tenance Officer Course) (HQ AFRC functional area, NAF, unit).
  5.2.12. Maintain an "open door" policy during the trainee’s assignments to resolve local problems and
  report significant program problems through channels (HQ AFRC, NAF, unit).
  5.2.13. Conduct training of trainees and monitor progress (HQ AFRC functional area, unit).
  5.2.14. Pursue and complete training requirements (trainee).
  5.2.15. Discuss the various phases and subject matter of the training with the assigned instructor
  (trainee).
  5.2.16. Ensure that the AP trainees perform only flying duties, or duties directly related to flying, and
  unit management responsibilities (unit).
  5.2.17. As appropriate, establish personal contact with trainees during staff visits to offer encourage-
  ment and to observe progress (HQ AFRC, NAF, unit).
  5.2.18. Provide/review supervisor’s periodic report of trainee’s progress and provide copy to HQ
  AFRC/DPCC for file maintenance (initiate: unit; review: HQ AFRC functional area, NAF, unit).
  5.2.19. Monitor appropriate vacancies within the command, beginning at least 6 m onths before the
  employee’s completion of training, for placement possibilities (HQ AFRC, NAF, unit). Unit with Air-
  plane Flight Instructor, GS-13, vacancy which has a trainee at the GS-12 level must restructure their
  vacancy and fill with the trainee before filling from outside sources. Nonselection of trainee must be
  approved by the NAF/CC.
34                                                                        AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996

     5.2.20. Forward trainee’s critique of completed training through channels to HQ AFRC functional
     office who sends a copy to HQ AFRC/DPCC for file main tenance (HQ AFRC functional area,
     trainee).
     5.2.21. Propose revisions to publications related to the program or issue supplemental functional
     guidance if needed (HQ AFRC, NAF, unit).

5.3. Authorizations and Position/Personnel Actions:
     5.3.1. Any NAF may request a Type B overhire for the period of training needed, plus one quarter for
     trainee placement according to appropriate manpower guidance. HQ AFRC approves/disapproves
     based on current CM B direction. NAFs designate unit locations where trainee positions are autho-
     rized (HQ AFRC/DPS designates for MPO). AFRC limits selection to captains (O-3) and below
     unless the NAF approves exception. Aircraft commander qualified pilots are not considered trainees.
     (See attachment 5, Summary of Differences Between the Various AFRC ART Officer Trainee Pro-
     grams.)
     5.3.2. Shortly before or upon c ompletion of training and all other requirements, the supervisor may
     submit an SF 52 to the servicing CPO to noncompetitively promote the employee to the trainee target
     grade which is one grade below the journeyman level. AFRC requires competition for placement into
     positions above the target grade level. T he servicing CPO must obtain HQ AFRC/DPCC approval
     prior to effecting any PAQ pilot trainee promotions to ensure compliance with Air Force funded poli-
     cies.
     5.3.3. Unit/NAF cancels the authorization when the position is vacated, for whatever reason (HQ
     AFRC/DPS cancels for MPO).
     5.3.4. PALACE ACQUIRE (PAQ) authorizations are for ART pilot trainee positions and are basically
     the same as AFRC funded spaces except that no Part A authorization appears on the UMD, and Air
     Force Personnel Center (AFPC) provides funding for the civilian space for a maximum of 2 years.
     AFRC funds for the corresponding Part B military authorization and identifies it as an ART coded
     "PAL ACQUIRE" in the command remarks code field of the UMD. In the event the trainee does not
     meet all military and civilian qualifications for the GS-13, Airplane Flight Instructor, position in the 2
     year training period, the unit may need to submit a request to establish an AFRC funded overhire posi-
     tion for up to 5 quarters for additional training.
        5.3.4.1. AFRC allocates PAQ spaces to the NAFs on an as-needed basis. Entry level to PAQ
        appointments is GS-9 ONLY. A ppointments are chargeable to FAC 1608PA, agency command
        code 2C, RC/CC 6116YS, and office structure code DPCPAQ. AFPC assigns personnel account-
        ing symbols and program element codes when the NAF identifies the specific location of the posi-
        tion.
     5.3.5. Reporting and Documentation Requirements:
        5.3.5.1. The unit to whom the trainee is assigned:
            5.3.5.1.1. Within 30-60 days after trainee enters on duty, develops and maintains a realistic
            milestone chart with trainee’s AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief. (For AP, unit may
            tailor chart after gaining command regulatory guidance concerning development of a pilot.)
            This milestone chart serves as an official training plan and includes any formal training
            schools required for the trainee’s development. AFRC requires a separate plan for each grade
AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996                                                                          35

        level and should include specific dates from start to completion of each phase of training. The
        milestone charts are applicable from the time of assignment until the trainee is fully qualified
        for promotion to the journeyman level. The supervisor should discuss the training plan so that
        the trainee has a full understanding of the objectives of the training.
        5.3.5.1.2. Schedule and summarize quarterly conferences with the trainee. These sessions
        allow discussion of problems and their solutions, and provide information and support to the
        trainee and feedback to the supervisor. (For airplane pilots, AFRC Form 57, Quarterly Con-
        ference Report and Evaluation of Airplane Pilot Trainee, is recommended.)
        5.3.5.1.3. Upon completion of the training program, accomplish a final report in narrative
        form and include an evaluation of the trainee and of the training program.
        (NOTE: Unit maintains above reports and documentation. NAF/CC/DPC and functional area
        must ensure compliance with reporting requirements during periodical staff assistance visits to
        the units.)
     5.3.5.2. The trainee evaluates the training received at the conclusion of the training and submits
     the evaluation through command channels to the NAF/CC and HQ AFRC functional area w ho
     provides a copy to HQ AFRC/DPCC. The trainee may want to include:
        5.3.5.2.1. Adequacy of the training outline, amount of time allowed for each unit of training
        (too much, too little, etc.).
        5.3.5.2.2. Effectiveness of instruction and guidance provided.
        5.3.5.2.3. Effectiveness of use of trainee’s time and the relation of work assignments to train-
        ing scheduled.
        5.3.5.2.4. Any other comments or suggestions for improving the program.
36                                                                      AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996

                                                 Chapter 6

     MOVEMENT OF ART OFFICERS AT GOVERNMENT EXPENSE AND RELOCATION
                          SERVICES (RS) PROGRAM

6.1. General. This chapter provides guidance relating to payment of expenses for permanent PCS
involving the expenditure of AFRC funds and the administration of the RS program.

6.2. Background. The JTR, volume 2, provides that PCS movements may be authorized at government
expense if such movement is determined to be in the best interest of the government. In addition, Public
Law 98-151 established the Relocation Assistance Act, allowing certain employees to dispose of their
home by the use of a third party relocation company. O n October 1, 1995, the Secretary of Defense
directed that all DoD RS contracts be consolidated into one DoD-wide program, known as the National
Relocation Program (NRP), administered by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

6.3. General Provisions:
     6.3.1. The selecting official must obtain approval from HQ AFRC/DPCC prior to tentative ART
     officer selections involving PCS of an employee who has a current signed transportation agreement as
     a result of a PCS within the past 12 months. The supervisor’s request for approval should be based on
     the tentative selectee’s superior qualifications when compared to the other competitors and mission
     impact if disapproved.
     6.3.2. AFRC (for example, gaining unit) determines when PCS moves are in the best interest of the
     government as indicated in the JTR, volume 2. The JTR defines reimbursable expenses. Be fore
     incurring any expenses, employee should sign DD Form 1618.

6.4. Relocation Services Program. The purpose of the RS program is to minimize the financial impact
of PCS, make transition from the former duty station to the new duty station easier for the employee and
the Air Force, and provide an alternative to direct reimbursement of PCS expenses (JTR, volume 2, chap-
ter 15).
     6.4.1. Only Air Force employees (including Excepted Service) who are selected for GS-12 and above
     Air Force career program positions (including AOCMP positions) are eligible to apply for RS. These
     services are not available for first duty station moves nor moves connected to any military assignment.
     Through the RS contractor eligible employees may apply for home sale, marketing assistance, prop-
     erty management, destination assistance, and spouse employment assistance. Only spouse employ-
     ment assistance expenses are charged to the employee on a nonreimbursable basis if the employee
     elects this coverage.
     6.4.2. Employees not covered by the RS program or who decline the RS program remain eligible for
     applicable direct reimbursement entitlements for buying and selling a dwelling as authorized in the
     JTR, volume 2, chapter 14, paragraph C14000.
     6.4.3. Steps in using the RS program: (See attachment 3, A FRC Relocation Services (RS) Check-
     list.)
        6.4.3.1. Employee accepts relocation and signs a DD Form 1618. Any expenses incurred before
        the form is signed might not be covered.
AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996                                                                           37

     6.4.3.2. ART officer completes Request for Relocation Services Form (attachment 4) and faxes/
     forwards to HQ AFRC/DPCC who verifies eligibility and forwards to United States Army Corps
     of Engineers, Administrator of the NRP, Baltimore, Maryland, who contacts the RS contractor.
     Request must be received by HQ AFRC/DPCC no later than 45 days after PCS effective date.
     Local reproduction of the form is authorized. Signing the form does not commit the employee to
     using the services, but only indicates that the employee may use the services.
     6.4.3.3. The contractor:
         6.4.3.3.1. Contacts and counsels employee.
         6.4.3.3.2. Orders structural inspection.
         6.4.3.3.3. Arranges for two market appraisals (employee selects three appraisers).
         6.4.3.3.4. Receives two appraisals-if more than ten percent difference, obtains third appraisal.
         6.4.3.3.5. Makes offer based on average of two closest appraisals. (Employee must list resi-
         dence with realtor for at least 60 days before RS contractor makes offer.) (NOTE: Employee
         must not sign a contract for sale of residence unless RS contractor counselor approves. Sign-
         ing a contract makes employee ineligible for RS.)
     6.4.3.4. Employee accepts or declines offer:
     6.4.3.5. If employee accepts the offer, receives equity and goes to new duty station.
     6.4.3.6. If employee receives a better bona-fide offer (amended value offer) during the acceptance
     period, the contractor may match the offer.
     6.4.3.7. If employee rejects offer, or the offer period expires, employee reverts to direct reim-
     bursement (JTR, volume 2, chapter 14).
     6.4.3.8. The RS program is optional to eligible employees.
  6.4.4. If the employee uses the guaranteed home sale option, some JTR allowance may be reduced;
  for example, temporary quarters subsistence expense. Employees may take their house hunting trip at
  their convenience rather than waiting for receipt of the contractor’s offer of value on their home.
  6.4.5. Under both the RS program and the direct reimbursement option, the residence must be owned
  by the employee or im mediate fa mily me mber at t he tim e AFRC fi rst definitely i nformed the
  employee that AFRC approved his or her transfer to the new duty station. (NOTE: A former spouse
  is not a member of the immediate family.)
  6.4.6. The home must be the actual residence of t he employee at the time AFRC first definitely
  informed the employee of the transfer. This residence must be the place from which the employee
  regularly commutes to and from work (JTR, volume 2, chapter 14, paragraph C14000).
  6.4.7. The home must be improved real estate which the employee or immediate family member
  owns, and which employee used as a year-round single family principal insurable residence. This
  includes condominiums, but excludes cooperative housing, mobile homes, houseboats, and yachts.
  6.4.8. If the employee is eligible for RS, the person publishing the PCS orders should place the fol-
  lowing statement on the published PCS orders: "This employee is eligible to use the relocation ser-
  vices contract and as such is subject to the entire relocation services contract program which impacts
  all PCS entitlements."
38                                                                     AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996

     6.4.9. Since all employees participating in the guaranteed home sale option must list their home with
     a real estate broker for 60 days, the employee ensures the exclusion clause contained in the AFRC
     Relocation Services (RS) Checklist (attachment 3) is included in the agreement.
     6.4.10. The RS program includes the following options to assist the relocating employee/family:
        6.4.10.1. Destination assistance for finding a home at the new location, including rental assistance
        and mortgage counseling. This service is available to all employees at no cost to the Air Force.
        6.4.10.2. Property management, available for up to 2 ye ars in situations where the employee is
        eligible for real estate reimbursement under the JTR, volume 2, and is reasonably expected to
        return to the old duty station. The contractor assumes the responsibility of collecting the rent and
        making the mortgage payments, etc. (NOTE: If the employee elects to use the property manage-
        ment program, he or she may not use the guaranteed home sale program pursuant to the same
        PCS.)
        6.4.10.3. Spouse career counseling (at employee’s expense) provides guidance and training on
        planning a job search, interviewing skills, and analyzing career skills and opportunities.
     6.4.11. The RS program applies if AFRC selects an otherwise eligible employee through the AOCMP
     for entry into an ART officer GS-12 level position or higher if:
        6.4.11.1. The position is restructured to the GS-11 level. (NOTE: Except for reassignment/pro-
        motion into pilot positions, the RS program does not apply if the position is restructured to the
        GS-09 level.)
        6.4.11.2. The selectee is currently an Air Force civilian employee. Th e RS program does not
        apply if the selectee is a federal service employee of another agency.
        6.4.11.3. The position is filled by a surplus ART officer from another geographic location.
     6.4.12. The RS program does not apply if an ART officer relocates to a GS-12 or higher position in
     another federal agency.
     6.4.13. Under extenuating circumstances, eligible employees may request authority from HQ AFRC/
     DPCC to delay entry into the RS program for up to 1 year from the date he or she reported to the new
     duty station. HQ AFRC/DPCC must receive the request within 45 days of the PCS. The reason for
     requesting the delay must not be for personal gain (for example, waiting for the housing market to
     improve). Due to the flexible timetable (see attachment 3, AFRC Relocation Services (RS) Checklist,
     paragraph 13), these requests should be rare.
     6.4.14. The intent of the RS contract is to provide employees with an alternative to the direct method
     of reimbursement authorized when an employee sells a home at a former duty station coincident with
     PCS. RS is not a protection for employee investment property and is not designed to provide more of
     a financial advantage than if the employees sold their home themselves. The home sale assistance
     program provides employees with an opportunity to accept "fair market value" for t heir home. The
     Society of Real Estate Appraisers describes "fair market value" as follows: "A relocation appraisal is
     an estimate-a highly educated estimate-of the most probable price for which your home will sell in the
     current market within a reasonable length of time." The Air Force defines reasonable length of time
     as the normal marketing time for a given geographical area. The appraiser makes that determination.
     When employees accept the RS offer, they immediately receive their equity.
AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996                                                                               39

  6.4.15. The home s ale assistance program eliminates the pro cess of requesting and receiving reim-
  bursement for expenses incurred under JTR, volume 2. Emp loyees may still elect the direct reim-
  bursement method, which requires that they market and sell their home on their own (within a specific
  time period of 2 ye ars, with a possible 1 ye ar extension if justified and approved in writing). T hey
  must sell the home; wait for their equity disbursement; file a travel voucher; have the former duty sta-
  tion staff judge advocate certify expenses; and have the gaining activities accounting and finance
  office pay the travel voucher. Under direct reimbursement, the employee incurs a tax liability as a
  result of receiving a relocation allowance which is considered income. In contrast, the employee does
  not incur a tax liability when the RS is used. This is because the Internal Revenue Service does not
  consider receipt of equity from a relocation company to be income. The RS contract provides an
  expedited method of relieving employees from many of the difficulties in selling their homes.
  6.4.16. As authorized under the JTR, volume 2, paragraph C4110, when an ART officer (who is oth-
  erwise eligible for RS) who is entitled to mandatory restoration under FPM 353 returns from military
  duty and an appropriate vacancy does not exist at the place from which he or she entered the armed
  forces, the employee may be regarded as restored at that place for the purpose of paying his or travel
  expenses in connection with a transfer in the interest of the government, from the place of restoration
  to a place where a suitable vacancy is available within DoD. This provision allows RS coverage on
  the residence (if still owned) at the location they left to enter military service. (See JTR, volume 2, for
  further information.)

SELECTING SUPERVISOR’S (SS) CHECKLIST FOR FILLING AIR RESERVE TECHNICIAN
                         (ART) OFFICER VACANCIES
REFERENCE: AFRCI 36-111, Air Reserve Technician (ART) Officer Career Management Program
____1) S S: E nsures Unit Manpower Document (UMD) contains an authorization for the position. (If
not, check with unit manpower person [usually the military personnel flight (M PF) chief] to obtain the
authorization and/or have it appear on the UMD).
____2) SS: Ensures management has written the position description (PD) for the position and that it is
accurate. (If not, check with servicing civilian personnel office (CPO) and/or position classification spe-
cialist at HQ AFRC/DPCC, DSN 497-1309/10/11.)
____3) SS: May "name request" and "earmark" for SF 52, Request for Personnel Action, to the CPO, and
may list preferred sources such as HQ AFRC/DPC Special Examining Unit (SEU), promotion, Veterans
Readjustment Appointment (VRA) (up to GS-11), reinstatement eligible, transfer eligible, etc.
____4) CPO: Verifies UMD authorization, position description (PD), position classification, and grade.
____5) CP O: Che cks priorities; for example, local reduction-in-force (RIF) eligibles, DoD Priority
Placement Program (PPP) (often called the "stopper list") eligibles.
____6) CPO: Requests recruitment action from HQ AFRC/DPCC. May include recruitment action from
any or all sources.
____7) HQ AFRC/DPCC: Refers qualified ART officers command-wide who are 1) excess, or 2) train-
ees who have completed their training, (nonselection requires numbered air force [NAF] commander
[CC] approval). HQ AFRC/DPCC refers excess and trainees at current grade and the repromotion eligi-
bles on grade retention up t o the highest permanent grade previously held. SS may repromote any
employee who previously permanently held position at or above the grade of the vacancy (even if not cur-
rently on grade retention). (See step 10 if SS selects one.)
____8) HQ AFRC/DPCC: Requests certificate from the SEU and/or develops promotion certificate or
listing of other candidates (for example, VRA, reinstatement) as appropriate, and clears all other appropri-
ate priorities (for example, Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan (ICTAP)).
(NOTE: Since SS fill most ART officer vacancies from appointments from the SEU, promotion certifi-
cates, or reassignment candidates, this guide lists only those sources. If SS uses other sources (or exam-
ple, VRA, reinstatement, etc.) the SS should contact HQ AFRC/DPCC staffing specialist for guidance.
See phone numbers listed at the end of the checklist.)
____9) HQ AFRC/DPCC: Receives appointment certificate from the SEU.
____a) HQ AFRC/DPCC: Checks military qualifications with appropriate HQ AFRC reserve office (for
example, HQ AFRC/DPM or DPO). If not militarily qualified, submits documentation to the SEU to sub-
stantiate removal from the certificate/register. If militarily qualified, refers to SS.
____b) HQ AFRC/DPCC: If name request is within the top three and higher ranking veterans preference
eligible does not block selection (of non-veterans preference eligible), SS may make instant tentative
selection by phone.
AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996                                                                            43

____c) HQ AFRC/DPCC: If SS had no name request or if name request is not within reach, determines
availability of candidates by mailing OF 5, Inquiry as to Availability, and waiting 10 days for responses.
____d) HQ AFRC/DPCC: Refers certificate and applications to SS.
____e) SS: Reviews candidates and documents declinations (if any). May request additional name from
HQ AFRC/DPCC for each declination. Makes tentative selection or returns certificate unused. ( If SS
returns certificate unused, must wait 30 days before requesting new certificate.)
____f) H Q AFRC/DPCC: Re views tentative selection, obtains appropriate coordination, and issues
approval memorandum to servicing CPO, with copy to selecting supervisor, wing and NAF/CC, NAF/
DPC, and selectee.
____g) MPF: Per request from CPO, reviews reserve assignment, physical, etc., confirms eligibility in
writing (for example, DD Form 359, Referral for Consideration) to CPO, and processes reserve assign-
ment. If ineligible, provides CPO information in writing.
____h) CPO: After receiving written confirmation (for example, DD Form 359) that selectee meets mil-
itary/reserve qualifications, processes civilian assignment.
____10) HQ AFRC/DPCC: In order, issues excess list, trainee list, repromotion (with grade retention)
certificate, and (or) promotion certificate, along with one-page briefs to SS.
____a) SS: Reviews lists/certificates and makes tentative selection.
____b) HQ AFRC/DPCC: Reviews tentative selection, obtains appropriate coordination, and issues
approval message to servicing CPO with copy to selecting official, MPF, wing and NAF CC, NAF/DPC,
and selectee.
____c) MPF: Per request from CPO, reviews reserve assignment, physical, etc., confirms eligibility in
writing (for e xample, DD Form 359) t o CPO, and processes reserve assignment. If i neligible, provides
CPO information in writing.
____d) CPO: After receiving written confirmation (for example, DD Form 359) from MPF that selectee
meets military/reserve qualifications, processes civilian assignment.)
____11) If SS is filling position by reassignment (same civilian grade) of current ART officer, the SS
chooses which of the two types of reassignment is to be used; either management directed reassignment
(MDR) or employee requested reassignment (ERR). (NOTE: If SS is interested in filling by competitive
reassignment, contact HQ AFRC/DPCC.)
____a) S S: For MDR, obtains wing/CC approval of a message (Banyan Vines is acceptable) to HQ
AFRC/DPCC with a copy to NAF/CC, requesting the MDR of the ART officer. (SS usually obtains ver-
bal approval before submitting the message). If more than one NAF is involved, both must concur and the
SS should include a statement in the message that both have concurred. SS submits SF 52 t o servicing
CPO concurrently with submitting message to HQ AFRC/DPCC.
____b) SS: For ERR, requests a listing of ART officers who have submitted a written request through
supervisory channels to HQ AFRC/DPCC requesting reassignment or change-to-lower grade (CLG) con-
sideration.
____12) SS: If source of candidates is to be VRA, reinstatement of former civil service employees, trans-
fer eligibles from other agencies, etc., contact HQ AFRC/DPCC staffing specialists.

        ment for 12 m onths a nd t urn i n t o s ervicing c ivilian pe rsonnel of fice. A ny e xpenses i ncurred

   3.   Complete Request for Re location S ervices F orm. ( NOTE: A copy of t he PCS orders m ay be
        requested.) Send to HQ AFRC/DPCC, who verifies eligibility and forwards to the Army Corps of
        Engineers, Administrator of t he National Relocation Program Office (NRPO). They notify the
        contractor (for example, Associates Relocation Management Company, Inc. (ARMC)) who con-
        tacts the employee. To be eligible, you must be a current Air Force employee selected through a
        career program (for example, ART Officer Career Management Program) for a GS-12 or above
        position. NOTE: Be very sure conditions specified on the form are met (for example, ownership
        of residence, commutes to work from residence and back each day). If you need to data fax, send
        to HQ AFRC/DPCC, fax number: D SN 497-0358/0355. NOTE: M UST AP PLY WITHIN 45
        DAYS OF PCS MOVE.
   4.   Read and become familiar with the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), vol 2.
   5.   Contact one or more real estate brokers and select best one to aid in marketing the house. Since
        all RS employees must list their home for sale for at least 60 days, you must include an "exclusion
        clause" i n the l isting agreement with your broke r. T his clause a llows you t o cancel the listing
        agreement without incurring a broker’s commission should you elect to accept ARMC’s appraised
        value offer during the offer and acceptance period. This clause also permits you to assign an offer
        to ARMC to relieve you of the responsibility of closing the sale with the buyer. Use the following
        "exclusion clause" wording:
"The Seller(s) hereby reserve the right (1) to sell the Property directly to Associates Relocation Manage-
ment Company, Inc. (ARMC), or a designated affiliate at any time, and in such event, to cancel this listing
agreement with no obligation for a commission or continuation of listing hereafter; or (2) to turn over an
acceptable written offer hereunder to ARMC for closing and payment of c ommission which shall be
deemed earned and payable only upon closing of sale, in accordance with the terms thereof."
If you encounter a problem when requesting that this exclusion clause be included in your listing agree-
ment, please contact your ARMC relocation representative immediately at 1-800-523-3267.
    1. When c ontacted by t he c ontractor’s counselor, work closely w ith t hem and read/study m aterial
        provided by t hem. Cons ider their a dvice, select a ppraisers, be available, a nd provi de timely
        responses to counselor, appraiser, etc. NOTE: DO NOT SIGN A CONTRACT FOR SALE OF
        YOUR RESIDENCE UNLESS YOUR COUNSELOR APPROVES. SIGNING A CONTRACT
        WILL MAKE YOU INELIGIBLE FOR RS.
    2. Try to be objective about the offer, which is based on an average of two appraisals. The appraisals
        are based on the judgment of appraisers and appraising is not an exact science. The appraisals are
        for fair market value (for example, most probable selling price). The fair market value is different
        from mortgage/loan/insurance/tax value.
    3. In reviewing the appraisals, if the appraisers overlooked something (for example, houses that are
        better comparables to the employee’s house (broker can help here)), file an appeal with the con-
46                                                                           AFRCI36-111 8 November 1996

          tractor, provi ding specific i nformation, da ta, c omparables, e tc., that t he a ppraiser c an us e t o
          re-evaluate hi s/her a ppraisal. S imply di sagreeing without provi ding s upporting da ta/evidence
          will probably result in no change. View the offer as the lowest offer (for example, rock-bottom
          offer), and continue working closely with the real estate broker to get a better offer. If a higher
          offer is received, the contractor will match a bona-fide better offer. A higher offer means more
          money to the employee, an immediate sale for the contractor, and less expense for the Air Force/
          AFRC.
     4.   If the offer is completely unacceptable, carefully consider letting the offer period expire, rely on
          broker to sell the residence, and after the sale, file a travel voucher to claim reimbursement for
          covered expense i ncurred. W eigh costs c arefully (for e xample, a dditional house pa yments)
          against the anticipated gain.
     5.   The RS progra m is de signed to provi de market value for t he house. It c annot c ompensate for
          declining housing markets in depressed areas nor c an it compensate for de cisions not based on
          good e conomic re sale l ogic (for e xample, t he e mployee m ay ha ve t o pa y for ove rbuilding a
          neighborhood when selling).
     6.   The RS is optional, provides immediate equity without waiting for resale, and has been accepted
          by many ART officers.
     7.   Pre-move counseling a nd de stination services i nformation a re available by c alling
          1-800-523-3267 and asking for the client services counselor for the Air Force.
     8.   If you need to contact HQ AFRC/DPCC, call DSN 497-1342.
