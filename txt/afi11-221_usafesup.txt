SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
reflects the re-designation of the USAFE Air Mobility Operations Control Center (AMOCC)
as the 603d Air and Space Operations Center Air Mobility Division (603 AOC/AMD) and
clarifies different organizational responsibilities and procedures for scheduling of USAFE
assigned tanker aircraft.
1.1. (Added) Single Manager. 603 AOC/AMD Air Refueling Control Team (Air Mobility
Division Air Refueling [AMDR]) is the single manager for all USEUCOM air refueling
missions and is responsible for allocating all USAFE assigned/attached tanker assets. 603
AOC/AMD Execution assumes command and control responsibility for all Air Mobility
Division (AMD) tasked air refueling/airlift missions and USAFE gained and possessed KC-
10 and KC-135 aircraft in coordination with 100 Air Refueling Wing (ARW) Command Post
(100ARW/CP). 603 AOC/AMD will comply with all 618th Tanker Airlift Control Center
(618 TACC) responsibilities listed in AFI 11-221, Air Refueling Management (KC-10 and
KC-135), except where modified in the following paragraphs.

  WEAPONS TRAINING DEPLOYMENTS (WTD) AND CROSS-SWITCH
                      OPERATIONS
A2.1. (Added) General:
A2.1.1. (Added) This information supplements instructions contained in FAA Handbook
7610.4K, Special Military Operations, Chapter 10, and prescribes specific procedures for
over-land fighter movements (Cross-Switch) and Weapons Training Deployment (WTD)
missions.
A2.1.2. (Added) Cross-Switch and WTD missions should be scheduled through the quarterly
scheduling process to the maximum extent possible. Requests must be received no later than
the earliest of the following three dates:
A2.1.2.1. (Added) 15 calendar days prior to tanker launch date.
A2.1.2.2. (Added) 3 calendar days prior to ALTRV lead time.
A2.1.2.3. (Added) 3 calendar days prior to the most restrictive diplomatic clearance lead
time.
A2.1.3. (Added) Due to a high tanker operations tempo, Cross-Switch missions will not be
tasked to support less than 2 receiver aircraft.
A2.2. (Added) Tanker Dual Role Requests. Dual role requests require validation and a
Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM) number from 603 AOC/AMD Requirements.
Units desiring dual role support must include the request in the remarks section of their
quarterly Receiver Integrated Planning System (RIPS) file. The receiver unit must submit
the actual dual role request and unit fund cite to 603 AOC/AMD Requirements no later than
the Cross-Switch and WTD mission request timing listed in para A2.1.2 (Added) above.
Dual role requests will only be validated for 603 AOC/AMD tasked refueling requirements.
Because the primary mission role is refueling, the refueling requirement must be met without
regard to protecting cargo capability IAW AFI 11-2KC-135V3, C/KC-135 Operations
Procedures.
A2.3. (Added) Mission Planning.
A2.3.1. (Added) All Cross-Switch and WTD refueling support must be performed on an
established refueling track or on a European Central Altitude Reservation Facility
(EUCARF) coordinated ALTRV. A consolidated ALTRV request must be submitted to
EUCARF by the receiver unit prior to all lead times. The receiver unit planner must
coordinate with the 100 OSS to include all tanker information in the ALTRV.
A2.3.2. (Added) The receiver unit must coordinate all mission details with the 603
AOC/AMD at the earliest possible opportunity. As a minimum, these include the receiver
offload plan, call signs, refueling track coordinates and altitudes, a 24 hour Point of Contact
(not a primary crewmember) and/or Command and Control agency and communications
plan. Receiver units must provide the ALTRV request, the submitted Approval Request
(APREQ) and final ALTRV approval to 603 AOC/AMDR Air Refueling Control Team, 603
AOC/AMD Execution and Flight Planning (100 OSS/OSK). Failure to provide the necessary
information to the EUCARF, 603 AOC/AMD and 100 OSS/OSK prior to ALTRV and
diplomatic clearance lead times will result in loss of tanker support.
A2.3.3. (Added) For missions involving multiple tanker/receiver cells, minimum spacing
between cells is 30 minutes and the maximum number of receivers per cell is six (6). The
tanker will assume Military Authority Assumes Responsibility of Separation of Aircraft
(MARSA) for rendezvous and during all cell operations.
A2.4. (Added) Greek and Italian Corridor Procedures. The Italian (BRAVO and
DELTA) and Greek (CRETE and KARPATHOS) Corridors, described in DoD FLIP (AP/2),
Area Planning Europe-Africa-Middle East are the most commonly used routes for WTD and
Cross-Switch refueling missions. The use of these corridors requires Greek and Italian
diplomatic clearances and a EUCARF coordinated ALTRV.

                  USAFE KC-135 AIRCRAFT SCHEDULING
A3.1. (Added) Aircraft Scheduling. 603 AOC/AMD coordinates and tasks 100 OSS to
support validated Priority 3A and higher long range ―horseblanket‖ and short-notice tanker
missions. 100 OSS coordinates and supports Priority 3B and lower horseblanket and short
notice tanker missions.
A3.1.1. (Added) 603 AOC/AMD will notify 100 OSS of taskings by electronic tasking
message (see Attachment 6 (Added) for example). 603 AOC/AMD will not task 100 ARW
before Inside-24/96 and/or Surge Approval requests have been fully coordinated, if required.
A3.1.1.1. (Added) Missions which appear on the quarterly horseblanket schedule (to include
horseblanket coronet missions) are considered tasked as listed. This finalized schedule will
be sent to 100 OSS. However, 603 AOC/AMD will not provide an electronic tasking
message for these missions.
A3.1.1.2. (Added) Inside-96 Approval. An Inside-96 hour tasking is defined as a mission
tasking in which unit notification time is less than 96 hours from take-off time. Inside-96
hour approval authority is 603 AOC/AMD Chief or designated representative in coordination
with the 100 OG/CC or designated representative. 603 AOC/AMD will document and track
all Inside-96 requests.
A3.1.1.2.1. (Added) 603 AOC/AMD will notify 100 OG/CC of Inside-96 hour taskings by
electronic message (see Attachment 7 (Added) for example) which must include a
completed copy of the USAFE Form 299, USAFE Inside 24/96 Hours Tanker Request
Checklist.
A3.1.1.3. (Added) Inside-24 Approval. An Inside-24 hour tasking is defined as a mission
tasking in which unit notification time is less than 24 hours from take-off time. 603
AOC/AMD Chief or designated representative will coordinate for approval with 100 OG/CC
and Commander 100 Air Refueling Wing (100 ARW/CC). If 100 ARW/CC non-concurs
with the Inside-24 hour request, Vice Commander, 3rd Air Force (3 AF/CV) or designated
representative is the decision authority. 603 AOC/AMD will document and track all Inside-
24 requests.
A3.1.1.3.1. (Added) 603 AOC/AMD will notify 100 OG/CC of Inside-24 hour taskings by
electronic message which must include a completed copy of the USAFE Form 299.
A3.1.1.4. (Added) Surge Approval. 603 AOC/AMD will document and track all surge
requests.
A3.1.1.5. (Added) Mission Delay of a Previously Tasked Missions (Slip Requests). A delay
is defined as an event (maintenance, operations, personnel, administration, etc.) which results
in mission postponement beyond AFI 11-2KC-135-V3, C/KC-135 Operations Procedures,
Chapter 3 requirements. Slip Request approval authority is 603 AOC/AMD Chief or
designated representative in coordination with 100 OG/CC. 603 AOC/AMD will document
and track all Slip Requests.
A3.1.1.5.1. (Added) 603 AOC/AMD will notify 100 OG/CC by electronic message (USAFE
Form 298, USAFE Tanker Slip Request will be used for coordination).
A3.1.2. (Added) In-System Select. 603 AOC/AMD tasked missions in execution may
become an In-System Select to fill short-notice requirements. In-System Select is a change
to an existing 603 AOC/AMD tasked mission, which does not result in a mission slip into the
next calendar day. In-System Selects do not require generation of a new electronic tasking
message or require Inside-24/96 approval.
A3.1.2.1. (Added) Should an In-System Select mission be extended beyond the original
tasking date, Slip Request procedures will be initiated.
A3.1.2.2. (Added) In-System Select missions will receive 603 AOC/AMD support as
appropriate for an Inside-24 hour tasking.
A3.1.2.3. (Added) 603 AOC/AMD Execution will notify 100 ARW/CP of mission changes
and make appropriate changes to GDSS.
A3.1.3. (Added) 603 AOC/AMD tasked aircraft which become non-mission capable,
mission delayed and/or diverted at an off-station location are counted as tasked missions until
returned to home-station.
A3.1.4. (Added) 603 AOC/AMD will ensure all short-notice and horseblanket 603
AOC/AMD tasked missions are loaded into GDSS by 1200Z Thursday the week prior to
execution.
A3.1.4.1. (Added) Changes and cancellations to 603 AOC/AMD tasked missions outside of
execution will be coordinated with the appropriate receiver unit and/or scheduling agency
and updated in GDSS by 603 AOC/AMDR, who will contact 100 OSS in-turn.
A3.1.4.2. (Added) Changes and cancellations to 603 AOC/AMD tasked missions in
execution will be coordinated with the appropriate receiver unit, scheduling agency and 100
ARW/CP and updated in GDSS by 603 AOC/AMD Execution.
A3.1.5. (Added) Changes and cancellations to 100 OSS scheduled missions will be
coordinated with the appropriate receiver and updated in GDSS by 100 OSS.
A3.2. (Added) Long Range Scheduling ―Horseblanket‖ Procedures.
A3.2.1. (Added) USAFE Assigned Receiver Units. 603 AOC/AMD will pre-
program two JCS Priority 2 training lines into the USAFE horseblanket (2A3:
Exercises, 2C3: Pre-deployment Training). These training lines are an addition to
Priority 3B and lower training lines already available from 100 ARW.
A3.2.1.1. (Added) The 2A3 line is available to units for exercises and training programs
directed by European Command (EUCOM), NATO, USAFE, and Third Air Force (3 AF).
A3.2.1.2. (Added)     The 2C3 line is available for training necessary to maintain unit
readiness.
A3.2.2. (Added) Units may request Priority 3B and lower training lines on any date,
including dates 603 AOC/AMD has pre-programmed 2A3 and 2C3 training lines.
A3.2.2.1. (Added) Priority 3B and lower training lines are available for training and
supported by 100 ARW.
A3.2.2.2. (Added) Units should submit requests for Coronet support directly to Air Combat

A3.2.3. (Added) Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Receiver Units. 603 AOC/AMD will pre-
program two JCS Priority 2B1 training lines into the USAFE horseblanket. These training
lines are for FMS training. FMS units should limit requests to one training line per day.
A3.2.3.1. (Added) FMS units should also use the horseblanket to request Coronet and Cross-
Switch support. Receiver units requesting Coronet or Cross-Switch support should not
request normal training during the same time period.
A3.2.3.2. (Added) The 2B1 line is available for support of fully funded FMS case codes.
FMS Receivers must have a valid FMS case on file at HQ Air Mobility Command/Financial
Services Branch (HQ AMC/A87F) with sufficient funds and valid clearance letter on file
with Air Refueling Operations Branch (HQ AMC/A3VK) before submitting an air refueling
request to 603 AOC/AMD.
A3.2.4. (Added) Higher Headquarters Exercises. 603 AOC/AMD will pre-program one JCS

                              Attachment 4 (Added)
       USAFE TANKER AIRCREW/AIRCRAFT TASKING SYSTEM
A4.1. (Added) Allocation of Tanker Aircraft. Allocation procedures for USAFE tanker
aircraft are based upon Air Mobility Command’s Aircrew/Aircraft Tasking System (AATS).
A percentage of the tanker unit’s possessed primary authorized aircraft are allocated for
operations and training. This percentage is known as the commitment threshold. The
allocation number is rounded down to the nearest integer value. The remaining aircraft are
made available to maintenance to sustain the fleet.
A4.1.1. (Added) The normal USAFE tanker aircraft commitment threshold is 80% with
maximum surge commitment threshold determined by 100 OG/CC and Commander,
Maintenance Group (100 MXG/CC) for contingency operations. Refer to Table A4.1.
(Added).
A4.1.1.1. (Added) The normal USAFE tanker aircraft allocation is 12 aircraft per day based
upon 15 100 ARW Possessed Primary Authorized Aircraft (PPAA).
A4.1.1.2. (Added) 100 ARW is authorized three (3) aircraft per day as fenced trainers. This
number includes both flying training and maintenance ground trainers. 100 ARW may
utilize either AMD tasked missions or unit coordinated missions to best meet unit training
requirements.
A4.1.2. (Added) A change of operational control (CHOP) of aircraft occurs when
operational control (OPCON) of the aircraft has changed from CDRUSEUCOM to another
Combatant Commander and are no longer under USAFE control. 603 AOC/AMD
determines the number of aircraft CHOP’d from each unit.
A4.1.3. (Added) The primary method for tasking allocated aircraft is by electronic tasking
message provided by 603 AOC/AMD to 100 OSS (see Attachment 6 (Added) for example).
In the event the primary tasking method is unavailable, tasking will be by telephone and
FAX.
A4.1.4. (Added) HQ USAFE/A3T is the office of primary responsibility for tanker aircraft
allocation waivers in coordination with HQ USAFE/A4M and 603 AOC/AMD for final
approval by HQ USAFE/A3.
A4.2. (Added) Aircraft Tasking Level. The number of tanker aircraft that 603 AOC/AMD
is able to assign missions is referred to as the AMD Aircraft Tasking Level. The number of
missions 603 AOC/AMD is able to assign is limited only by aircraft re-generation capability
and aircrew availability. The AMD Aircraft Tasking Level is determined by subtracting the
number of tanker aircraft fenced for unit training from the aircraft allocation.
A4.2.1. (Added) Aircraft are counted against the tasking level by Zulu date of takeoff,
regardless of landing time. Example: If an aircraft takeoff time is 2300Z on Monday and
landing time is 0200Z on Tuesday, the aircraft is only counted against the tasking level on
Monday.
A4.2.1.1. (Added) Aircraft that are scheduled to land after 0400Z will receive tasking credit
for that day.
A4.2.2. (Added) An aircraft that can complete an assigned mission and be regenerated to fly
a second mission, which is completed within the same calendar day it is considered one
tasking.
A4.2.3. (Added) Under special circumstances, adjustments can be made to the AMD
Aircraft Tasking Level.
A4.2.3.1. (Added) An adjustment of one (1) aircraft will be granted when four (4) or more
aircraft are deployed off-station. An adjustment of two (2) aircraft will be granted when six
(6) or more aircraft are deployed off-station. The adjustment will take effect the first day of
execution when all aircraft are physically off-station. Aircraft generated from home-station
do not qualify for off-station adjustment, regardless of destination.
A4.2.3.2. (Added) Adjustment requests for periods greater than 120 days must be
coordinated by 100 ARW/CC with HQ USAFE/A3T, HQ USAFE/A4M and 603 AOC/AMD
for final approval by HQ USAFE/A3.
Table A4.1. (Added) Allocation of Tanker Aircraft Formulas.

Allocation of Tanker Aircraft Formulas

1. Allocated Tanker Aircraft = [(Avg Possessed PAA – CHOP’d) x (80% Commitment
Threshold)]

2. AMD Aircraft Tasking Level = [Allocated Tanker Aircraft – Training Fence] –
Approved Adjustments


A4.2.4. (Added) Missions directed by HQ USAFE/A3 are considered AMD tasked missions.
HQ USAFE/A3 directed missions include the following:
A4.2.4.1. (Added) International and domestic air shows and static displays.
A4.2.4.2. (Added) Missions supporting Operational Readiness Inspections.
A4.2.4.3. (Added) Team Travel missions supporting USAF programs.
A4.3. (Added) Aircraft Surge Operations. Periods when aircraft requirements exceed the
AMD Aircraft Tasking Level are referred to as surges. Surges are normally only approved
for JCS Priority 1 and 2 missions and contingency requirements given the severe impact on
training and health of the fleet.
A4.3.1. (Added) 603 AOC/AMD Chief or designated representative may approve surges of
one (1) aircraft for up to three (3) days, but must inform 100 OG/CC prior to tasking
(USAFE Form 297, USAFE Tanker Surge Request will be used for coordination).
A4.3.2. (Added) 603 AOC/AMD will coordinate for concurrence with 100 OG/CC and 100
ARW/CC for surges of more than one (1) aircraft and/or surges of greater than three (3) days.
In the event 100 ARW/CC non-concurs, the request will be forwarded to 3 AF/CV for a final
decision.
A4.3.3. (Added) 603 AOC/AMD Chief will coordinate extended surge period requests
through 100 ARW/CC, HQ USAFE/A3T, HQ USAFE/A4M and HQ USAFE/A3 for
approval by 3 AF/CV. Extended surges are periods greater than 15 consecutive days or more
than 30 cumulative days within a quarter year period.
A4.3.3.1. (Added) 3 AF/CV may approve periods of extended surges for contingency
operations up to an commitment threshold determined by 100 OG/CC and 100 MXG/CC.
A4.3.4. (Added) Maximum Surge. Operations under Maximum Surge conditions are of
such intensity that all available aircraft are allocated to 603 AOC/AMD. All training is
suspended. Indefinite suspension of the commitment threshold is necessary under Maximum
Surge operations. 603 AOC/AMD Chief will coordinate Maximum Surge and commitment
threshold suspensions with 100 ARW/CC, HQ USAFE/A3T and HQ USAFE/A3 for final
approval by 3 AF/CV.
A4.3.5. (Added) Surge Recovery. The intent of surge recovery is to permit sufficient time
for a tanker unit to recover lost training and maintenance due to increased tasking levels. 603
AOC/AMD will reduce the number of AMD taskings by the same amount that the unit
surged. Surge recovery will be determined on a case-by-case basis and should be preplanned
for expected longer surges. Example: If the AMD Aircraft Tasking Level is 8 aircraft and
100 ARW is surged to 10 aircraft for 14 days, there should follow 14 days with 6 or fewer
AMD tasked aircraft. 603 AOC/AMD will notify 100 OSS of planned recovery periods, not
to include Saturday, Sunday, holidays, and no-fly days. 100 ARW may request relief
through HQ USAFE/A3 following any cumulative surge period of 30 days or greater within a
half. Accordingly, 603 AOC/AMD may be directed to reduce the AMD Aircraft Tasking
Level for a specific period of time.
A4.3.5.1. (Added)     100 OSS will coordinate requests for surge recovery with 603
AOC/AMD.
A4.3.5.2. (Added) 100 ARW/CC will coordinate requests for extended surge recovery
through 603 AOC/AMD, Maintenance Division (HQ USAFE/A4M), and HQ USAFE/A3T
for approval by 3 AF/CV.
A4.4. (Added) Aircrew Tasking Level. The number of tanker aircrews that 603
AOC/AMD is able to assign to missions is referred to as the AMD Aircrew Tasking Level.
The AMD Aircrew Tasking Level is determined by multiplying the total number of tanker
unit Line Qualified Aircrews by a temporary duty (TDY) Factor resulting in the total number
of aircrews available for AMD taskings. This number is rounded to the nearest integer value
(see Table A4.2. (Added)). The normal USAFE tanker aircrew TDY Factor is 45%.
Table A4.2. (Added) Aircrew Tasking Level Formula.

 Aircrew Tasking Level Formula

 AMD Aircrew Tasking Level = [(Total Line Qualified Aircrews x TDY Factor) –
 Adjustments]


A4.4.1. (Added) Line Qualified Aircrews is derived from the total number of temporarily
and permanently assigned and on-loan tanker aircraft crewmembers fully qualified to
perform specific flight duties. The crew position with the least amount of crewmembers is
considered the determining factor. Navigators are not considered when determining Line
Qualified Aircrews. Crew complement is determined by AFI 11-2KC-135V3, C/KC-135
Operations Procedures.
A4.4.1.1. (Added) Exceptions to Line Qualified Aircrew status.
A4.4.1.1.1. (Added) Squadron Commander.
A4.4.1.1.2. (Added) Director of Operations.
A4.4.1.1.3. (Added) Crewmembers who have not completed Mission Qualification Training,
theater indoctrination training, or any required difference training.
A4.4.1.1.4. (Added) Crewmembers expected to be in Duty Not Involving Flying (DNIF)
status for over 90 days.
A4.4.1.1.5. (Added) Crewmembers within 45 days of retirement from active duty.
A4.4.1.1.6. (Added) Crewmembers scheduled to Permanent Change of Station (PCS) within
30 days.
A4.4.2. (Added) TDY Factor. The number of days during a one-year period that aircrew are
performing flight duties is referred to as the TDY Factor. The USAFE standard TDY Factor
is 45% or 165 of 365 calendar days.
A4.4.2.1. (Added) Full Accounting. The TDY Factor is used to gauge the scope of tanker
unit operations and help measure the level of effort required to meet KC-135 taskings. A
tanker unit has reached Full Accounting when operating at the level of a 45% TDY Factor.
Full Accounting implies that all AMD taskings requirements are met and aircrews can
accomplish all other home-station duty requirements.          When operating under Full
Accounting, the following apply:
A4.4.2.1.1. (Added) All aircrew Air Force Instructions (AFI) flight training events can be
accomplished.
A4.4.2.1.2. (Added) 14 days per semester are available per crewmember for ground training
events.
A4.4.2.1.3. (Added) Full pre and post-mission crew rest can be granted.
A4.4.2.1.4. (Added) Post deployment downtime can be granted.
A4.4.2.1.5. (Added) 30 days of annual leave per crewmember is available.
A4.4.2.1.6. (Added) Historic levels of DNIF can be accommodated.
A4.4.2.1.7. (Added) Full tanker wing manning is available.
A4.4.2.1.8. (Added) PCS and retirements can be accommodated.
A4.4.3. (Added) AMD Aircrew Tasking Level is determined on a weekly basis (Monday-
Sunday) following AFI 11-2KC-135V3, C/KC-135 Operations Procedures crew
management guidance.
A4.4.4. (Added) Adjustments can be made to the TDY Factor for tanker units supporting a
large scale Air Expeditionary Force involving 50 or more personnel, aircraft conversion
training and other circumstances critically affecting training. Requests for adjustment
periods of greater than 120 days or which could result in an aircrew tasking level change of 2
or more aircrews must be coordinated by 100 ARW/CC with 603 AOC/AMD Chief and HQ
USAFE/A3T for final approval by 3 AF/CV.
A4.4.5. (Added) Commitment Period. Aircrews on AMD tasked missions are considered to
be committed from 0001Z of the day of departure through 2359Z of the day of return to
home station upon mission completion. Crews CHOP’d to other Combatant Commanders
are considered to be committed from the day of departure from home station through the day
of return to home station. Aircrews flying short duration ―round robin‖ air refueling
missions (less than 16 hours) are considered to be committed from 0001Z to 2359Z based on
the day of the ARCT. Missions are defined as ―round robin‖ when the aircrew departs and
lands at home station, with or without stopovers, in a 16-hour period.
A4.4.5.1. (Added) Aircrew Alerts. 603 AOC/AMD will task Alpha and Bravo Alert crews
from the AMD Aircrew Tasking Level. On change-over days, a second aircrew will not be
tasked since a tanker unit can changeover at midnight Zulu.
A4.4.5.1.1. (Added) Aircrew Alert Times will be in accordance with Table A4.3. (Added).
Table A4.3. (Added) Summer/Winter Aircrew Alert Times.

 Summer Aircrew Alert Times: 1 Apr – 31 Oct

 1. Single Ship: LFA 6+30, Alert 4+30, 3+30 Show

 2. Formation: LFA 7+00, Alert 5+00, 4+00 Show

 Winter Aircrew Alert Times: 1 Nov – 31 Mar

 1. Single Ship: LFA 7+00, Alert 5+00, 4+00 Show

 2. Formation: LFA 7+30, Alert 5+30, 4+30 Show


A4.4.5.2. (Added) Aircrew Swaps. Aircrew swaps to and from deployed locations will not
be counted against the AMD Aircrew Tasking Level unless the change has been directed by
603 AOC/AMD.
A.4.4.5.3. (Added) Augmented Crews. AMD tasked augmented crews will count as two
AMD tasked crews.
A4.5. (Added) Aircrew Surge Operations. Aircrew taskings above a previously agreed
TDY Factor is referred to as a surge. The required surge level request will include the
number of crews required and specify duration. 603 AOC/AMD Chief may approve surges
of one (1) aircrew for up to three (3) days, but must inform the 100 OG/CC prior to tasking.
603 AOC/AMD Chief will coordinate for concurrence with 100 OG/CC and 100 ARW/CC
for surges of one (1) or more aircrew and/or surges greater than three (3) days but less than
30 days. If 100 ARW/CC non-concurs with the surge request, the request will be forwarded
to 3 AF/CV for final decision.
A4.5.1. (Added) Surges of two (2) or more aircrews for greater than 30 days but less than
120 days must be coordinated by 603 AOC/AMD with 100 ARW/CC, HQ USAFE/A3T for
final approval by 3 AF/CV.
A4.5.2. (Added) 603 AOC/AMD must request a TDY Factor adjustment for surges forecast
to last greater than 120 days. TDY Factor adjustments must be coordinated with 100
ARW/CC and HQ USAFE/A3T for approval by 3 AF/CV.
A4.5.3. (Added) Maximum Surge. Operations under Maximum Surge conditions are of
such intensity that all available crews are allocated to 603 AOC/AMD. All training is
suspended. Indefinite suspension of the TDY Factor is necessary under Maximum Surge
operations. 603 AOC/AMD will coordinate Maximum Surge and TDY Factor suspensions
with 100 ARW/CC and HQ USAFE/A3T for approval by 3 AF/CV.
A4.5.3.1. (Added) Surge Recovery. Surge recoveries will only be granted following
Maximum Surge operations for 30 days or greater (cumulative) within a 6-month period.
The intent of surge recovery is to permit sufficient time for a tanker unit to recover lost
training. Tanker units will coordinate surge recovery requests with 603 AOC/AMD Chief
and HQ USAFE/A3T for approval by 3 AF/CV.

                  USAFE TANKER SCHEDULED RETURN TIMES
A5.1. (Added) Scheduled Return Times (SRT). SRT and Firm SRT (FSRT) are
scheduling tools used by tanker units to predict when crews will return to home station and
allows force managers to plan aircrew availability. SRT and FSRT does not apply to the
scheduling or return of aircraft. 100 ARW aircrews (except those on standby at home
station) will have an SRT established on their flight orders. Units, aircrews and Command
and Control (C2) agencies must be aware that flight orders and mission GDSS cut SRT
entries refer to mission end time, not FSRT. The FSRT for the crew will be entered in the
crew information section of the flight orders.
A5.1.1. (Added) Computations. 100 OSS will calculate SRTs using the mission end time.
The SRT is the same as the scheduled mission end time and will be used on the mission
GDSS cut for tracking purposes.
A5.1.1.1. (Added) Mission end time is defined as the time the aircrew is scheduled to return
to home station based on scheduled mission timing or return times printed in deployment
orders.
A5.1.1.2. (Added) 100 OSS will use mission duration estimate plus 48 hours for each time
the crew enters a stage for missions with stages of unknown duration.
A5.1.1.3. (Added) 603 AOC/AMD will determine SRT if scheduled for an AMD tasked
mission of unknown duration.
A5.1.1.4. (Added) Crews on alert will have to be determined ―TBD‖ on their orders for an
SRT. Upon alert notification, 100 ARW/CP will determine SRT based on projected mission
duration, enter this SRT in GDSS and inform the Aircraft Commander.
A5.1.1.5. (Added) SRT and FSRT rules apply to crews launched from alert.
A5.1.1.6. (Added) SRT for local training missions will be determined by crew duty day.
A5.1.2. (Added) Changing SRT. 100 OSS will change the SRT as dictated by mission
changes, itinerary, stages, etc. All changes shall be coordinated with 351st Air Refueling
Squadron (351 ARS) Aircrew Scheduling.
A5.1.2.1. (Added) SRT will not be changed within 12 hours of crew alert.
A5.1.3. (Added) Over-flying SRT. 100 OSS will coordinate with the Aircraft Commander,
Director of Operations (351 ARS/DO) and 603 AOC/AMD ARCT Chief if SRT will be over-
flown.
A5.1.3.1. (Added) 351 ARS/DO will arrange transportation and aircrew replacement for
aircrew returning home prior to mission completion.
A5.1.3.2. (Added) 603 AOC/AMD Chief or designated representative will coordinate for
approval of SRT over-flight for Natural Disaster Relief, Emergency Air Evacuation, and JCS
Priority 1 add-on missions with 100 OSS.
