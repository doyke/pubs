SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This publication has been revised to reflect transfer of responsibility and procedural changes. The
routing process for HAF MDs is further defined. Documentation requirements for periodic review of
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are provided and “non-substantive revisions” are re-titled
“administrative changes.” This Instruction has been substantially revised and should be reviewed
thoroughly.
1. Overview. HAF MDs are publications signed by the SECAF documenting the delegations of
authority and assignment of responsibility to HAF (Secretariat and Air Staff) two-letter offices.
When applicable, HAF MDs also state special limitations or provisions affecting the re-delegation
and/or assignment, that are not already specified in statute or other relevant documents. HAF MDs
do not dictate procedures. Any policy or procedural guidance required to implement the authorities
or responsibilities in HAF MDs will be issued in Air Force departmental publications in accordance
with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. All Secretary of the Air Force Orders
(SAFOs) in effect as of the date of this Headquarters Operating Instruction (HOI) remain in effect
until expressly cancelled or superseded by a HAF MD.
2. Responsibilities.
    2.1. The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/AA) administers the
    HAF Mission Directive process through the Information Directorate (SAF/AAI).
    2.2. Two-letter. Each HAF two-letter organization shall assign a point of contact (POC) / action
    officer (AO) that will develop and maintain the HAF MD. The POC/AO:
       2.2.1. Prepares their two-letter HAF MD using the appropriate template at
       Attachment 2, ensuring:
           2.2.1.1. The HAF MD is numbered as referenced in Attachment 3 of this HOI.
           2.1.1.2. DoD issuances assigned to the two-ltr organization IAW AFPD 90-1 and
           AFI 90-101, Processing Department of Defense Issuances, as documented in the
           Issuances, Delegations of Authority and Responsibilities (IDAR) database
           (https://www.idar.hq.af.mil/Presentation/Common/index.cfm), are included in
           Attachment 1 of the HAF MD.
           2.2.1.3. Narratives effectively describe the organization’s mission, delegated authority
           and assigned responsibilities including re-delegation limitations.
           2.2.1.4. The authorities/responsibilities accurately reflect information in the most current
           version of cited DoD issuances, statute, public law, or executive order.
       2.2.2. Obtains necessary functional/oversight and mandatory coordination (see paragraph
       4.1) using AF Form 673, Air Force Publication/Form Suspense Action Request.
       2.2.3. Staffs the final draft for certification and approval.
       2.2.4. Maintains the official record set of the HAF MD in accordance with instructions in
       AFI 33-360, and records management guidance in AFMAN 33-363.
       2.2.5. Ensures SOPs are developed as appropriate/necessary. HAF two-letterorganizations
       that regularly work together are encouraged, but not required, to develop SOPs that set forth
HOI 90-1 29 May 2013                                                                                 3


       the procedures that will be followed to fulfill and carry out the missions, and roles that are set
       forth in their respective HAF MDs. These SOPs shall fulfill and carry out the missions, roles
       and responsibilities that are set forth in writing and signed by the principals of the
       organizations concerned. All affected organizations should attach the SOPs to their
       respective HAF MDs. The SOPs shall be amended and reissued as needed or during rewrites
       of the HAF MD and attached to the HAF MD of the organizations concerned. Amended
       SOPs do not require prior notification or coordination with SAF/GCA or SAF/AAII.

       Issuance, Delegations of Authority and Responsibility (IDAR) database.
       2.4.5. Sends a request (using AF Form 673) to POC/AOs for periodic review of HAF MDs.
   2.5. Air Force Departmental Publishing Office (AFDPO): Posts approved HAF MDs on the
   e-Publishing website.
3. HAF MD Development. Attachment 2 includes two templates for HAF MDs (one for
Secretariat offices and one for Air Staff offices); the appropriate template must be applied when
developing a draft HAF MD.
   3.1. Publication body. The body will contain the following paragraphs/subparagraphs (see
   templates A2.1 and A2.2):
       3.1.1. “Mission.” A brief description of the organization’s mission.
       3.1.2. “Organizational relationships.” States to whom the head of the organization reports
       and describes any relationships with other organizations, i.e., relationships with organizations

       Operating Agencies (FOAs) and/or Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) that fall under an
4                                                                   HOI 90-1 29 May 2013


       organization will be referenced in this section. Their mission will be documented in an
       AFMD. See Attachment 2 for standard language to reference FOAs and/or DRUs.
       3.1.3. “Responsibilities.” A broad description of the organization’s responsibilities.
       3.1.4. “Delegations of Authority/Asssignments of Responsibility.” A single paragraph that
       will have the legal effect of incorporating the delegations of authority and assignments of
       responsibility set forth in Attachment 1 of each HAF MD and state the general rules for
       subsequent re-delegations of those authorities.
       3.1.5. “Notifications to Congress.” When appropriate, a paragraph stating general
       limitations on the authority to provide notifications or reports to Congress on re-delegated
       authorities.
    3.2. Publication Attachments.
       3.2.1. Attachment 1 will be titled “Delegations of SECAF Authority and Assignments of
       Responsibility.” Attachment 1 will set forth specific delegated authorities or assigned
       responsibilities along with the specific source of the authority/responsibility (typically
       Department of Defense issuances, although occasionally United States Code, Public Law,
       or Executive Order, if not cited in a DoD issuance).
       3.2.1.1 Individual entries in Attachment 1 should differentiate between specific authority
       delegated and overall responsibility for compliance with an authority assigned. See A2.2
       for examples.
           3.2.1.2. Special limitations or provisions affecting the specific re-delegation or
           reassignment; delegations may specify the lowest organizational level to which the
           SECAF will permit re-delegation and any other relevant limitations or conditions on
           the re-delegated authority.
           3.2.1.3. Unless re-delegation is restricted, any re-delegation or reassignment of
           authority will be documented in some other medium (i.e., a re-delegation is
           accomplished via memorandum or a departmental publication (e.g., AFI).
       3.2.2. Attachment 2 will describe the organizational structure of the two-letter organization.
       It includes an organizational chart, down to the three-letter/digit level and brief descriptions
       of each office’s fuctions.
       3.2.3. Attachment 3 will list SOPs, as applicable. See paragraph 2.2.5.
4. Coordination, Certification and Approval. Coordination is a two-step process that
includes obtaining external two-letter functional interest/oversight coordination and mandatory
coordination. POC/AOs may obtain coordination on draft publications using physical or
electronic medium however, an AF Form 673, showing consolidated two-letter coordination,
must accompany the draft submitted for publication. If the AF Form 673 contains coordination
more than one year old and no significant changes to the draft have been made, POC/AOs must
include a statement in Section V (Comments/Continuation) of the AF Form 673 referencing the
dated coordination and stating no recoordination is necessary before the Certifying Official (owning
two-letter) signs the form. If significant changes have been made, the POC/AO is responsible for
reaccomplishing necessary coordination. The AF Form 673 will be prepared as defined in AFI 33-
360.
HOI 90-1 29 May 2013                                                                               5


    4.1. Functional Interest/Oversight Coordination. Coordination from the HAF two-letter
    organizations with a functional interest in and/or oversight of the functions or offices concerned
    is annotated in section III of the AF Form 673. POC/AOs will work with these two-letter offices
    to resolve comments prior to submitting the HAF MD for mandatory coordination. Any
    comments, resolved or unresolved, resulting in a concur with comments statement in Section III
    of AF Form 673, will be documented using a comment matrix (CRM) and included.

    4.2. Mandatory Coordination. Mandatory coordination includes SAF/GCA and SAF/AAII
    Policy Branch.
         4.2.1. The POC/AO will obtain SAF/GCA coordination. SAF/GCA coordination is obtained
         AFTER functional/oversight coordination is complete, and BEFORE coordination is
         requested from SAF/AAII Policy Branch.
         4.2.2. The POC/AO will obtain SAF/AAII Policy Branch coordination. This is the final
         coordination received before certification and approval.
    4.3. Certification and Approval. After receiving mandatory coordination from SAF/GCA and
        SAF/AAII Policy Branch, the POC/AO will:
         4.3.1. Obtain Certifying Official’s (owning two-letter) signature on AF Form 673.
         4.3.2. Prepare a package that includes: the proposed draft HAF MD, the coordinated AF
         Form 673 and the CRM (if applicable) and route to SAF/GC for 2-ltr/digit coordination.
         4.3.3. Route package to SAF/AA for final coordination and submission, through HAF/ES,
         for approval by the Approving Official (SECAF) (see Table 4.1 below).
    4.4. After obtaining the Approving Official’s (SECAF) signature on AF Form 673, the
    POC/AO will submit the approved HAF MD and signed AF Form 673 to
    AFPDO, IAW AFI 33-360, for posting to the ePublishing website. The POC/AO will file
    and maintain the approved package as part of the official record-set.

5. Revisions. POC/AO will submit all proposed revisions to SAF/AAII Policy Branch. SAF/AAII
Policy Branch, in consultation with SAF/GCA, will determine whether proposed changes are
administrative or substantive.
6                                                                HOI 90-1 29 May 2013


    5.1. Administrative Changes (ACs). ACs are non-substantive revisions to the main text of the
    HAF MD or an attachment (e.g., office symbol change, organizational structure changes within
    the two-letter office). ACs do not change the SECAF’s delegated authority or assignment of
    responsibility. Only POCs/AOs may make administrative changes to their publications.
    SAF/AAII Policy Branch and SAF/GCA coordination is required. The POC/AO will provide a
    Word® document IAW the format referenced in AFI 33-360 for ACs. Both the POC/AO and the
    two-letter (certifying official) sign the appropriate area of AF Form 673. The POC/AO will
    submit to AFPDO, IAW AFI 33-360, for posting to the ePublishing website. The AC will sit on
    top of the HAF MD; the POC/AO will incorporate the information in the next rewrite.
    5.2. Substantive Changes. The delegation of a new authority, substantive change(s) to a DoD
    issuance, public law, or Executive Order, or a HAF reorganization/transfer of responsibilities
    between two-letters, are examples of events that may necessitate re-issuance of an existing HAF
    MD. Substantive changes to HAF MDs are coordinated and processed in the same manner as
    newly written HAF MDs. HAF MDs should be updated as soon as possible to reflect substantive
    changes.
6. Rescissions. Rescissions of HAF MDs are based on the decision of the Secretary to reorganize or
restructure the HAF (e.g., the disestablishment or merger of two-letter offices), or otherwise alter
delegations of authority and/or assignments of responsibility. Because HAF MDs delegate the
SECAF’s authority, a HAF MD may only be rescinded by the SECAF. HAF MDs must be
submitted for rescission using AF Form 673 and are coordinated and processed in the same manner
as a newly written HAF MD.

Air Force Mission Directives (AFMD) -- AFMDs are developed for directly assigned units
below the Headquarters Air Force level and above the squadron level. The AFMD provides
general information about an organization's mission and directly communicates the unit's mission
and responsibilities to the commander and unit personnel, and describes what an organization
does, not how it does it. Mission directives are written at the executive level. Publications are
issued in accordance with AFPD 10-1, Mission Directives, and AFI 10-101, Format and Content
of Mission Directives.

         of Air Staff Official ] work in cooperation with the [ List other HAF 2-letter/digit
         officials, as appropriate], and their respective offices, which are responsible,
         pursuant to Chapters 803 and 805 of Title 10 (10 USC §§ 8013-8023 and §§ 8031-
