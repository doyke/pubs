This pamphlet implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-30, Military Entitlements, and
Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 1300.18, Military Personnel Casualty Matters, Policies,
and Procedures. It describes procedures for the Casualty Services Program for all levels of command and
all Air Force organizations. This publication cannot be supplemented. Refer recommended changes and
conflicts between this and other publications to HQ AFPC/DPWCS, 550 C Street West, Suite 14, Ran-

This pamphlet provides general information about most federal benefits and entitlements available to eli-
gible family members of deceased retired Air Force personnel and explains the application process. You
can direct specific questions to the government agency administering the benefits or discuss these matters
with your casualty assistance representative (CAR). If unable to assist you or answer your questions, the
CAR will research the answer and get back with you. Government agencies outside the Air Force admin-
ister most of the benefits discussed in this pamphlet, determine eligibility for such benefits and establish
the amount paid.

Section B—General Information

2. Introduction. This pamphlet is designed to provide general information on most federal benefits and
privileges you may be entitled to as survivors of a deceased Air Force retiree. In addition, it contains a list

you to record the dates benefits were applied for and received at Attachment 3. After you have had an
opportunity to read this pamphlet, feel free to discuss any questions with your CAR. If they cannot answer
your questions, they will refer you to the appropriate military official or government agency, or get the
answer for you. If you need assistance in other matters not covered in this pamphlet, contact your CAR.

Section C—Burial Benefits

5. Transportation of Remains . The Air Force will pay to transport the remains of a retiree who died
while properly admitted to a Uniformed Services medical facility located in the United States. Transpor-
tation is from the place of death to a place no further distant than the place of last permanent residence.
Contact the installation Mortuary Affairs Office for specific information.

6. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Burial Benefits. Retired personnel are authorized interment
in national cemeteries. There is no cost incurred by the NOK as the cemetery grave space, opening and
closing of the grave, and the marker are provided by the VA. The VA pays burial benefits only if the
retiree was entitled to receive VA compensation, a VA pension, or if the retiree died in a VA hospital. If
the VA determines death was service-related, the NOK may receive an additional allowance. Funeral
homes normally have the application, VA Form 21-530, Application for Burial Allowance, to apply for
this benefit. If your funeral home does not have the application, contact your CAR or nearest VA office.
You should attach with the application, proof of the retiree’s military service (i.e., retirement order or DD
Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty), a copy of the death certificate, and
copies of funeral and burial expenses that you paid.
   6.1. Service-related death. The VA will pay up to $1,500 toward burial expenses. If the retiree is bur-
   ied in a VA national cemetery, some or all of the cost of moving the deceased may be reimbursed.
   There is no time limit for claiming reimbursement of burial expenses for a service-related death.
   6.2. Nonservice-related death. The VA will pay up to $300 toward burial and funeral expenses and a
   $150 plot interment allowance. If the death happened while the retiree was in a VA hospital or under
   contracted nursing home care, the cost of moving the deceased may be reimbursed. A claim must be
   filed within 2 years of the retiree’s burial.

7. Burial Flag. The VA can provide an American flag, at no cost, to drape the casket of a retiree or a
Reservist entitled to retired military pay. After the funeral service, the flag is given to the NOK as a keep-
sake. When there is no NOK, the VA will furnish the flag to a friend making a request for it. The claim

form required to apply for a flag is VA Form 2008, Application for United States Flag for Burial Pur-
poses. You may obtain a flag at any VA Regional Office (VARO) or United States Post Office. Generally,
the funeral director will help you obtain the flag.

8. Headstone or Grave Marker. The VA furnishes upon request, at no charge to the applicant, a govern-
ment headstone or marker for the unmarked grave of a retiree in any cemetery. Headstones and markers
are also provided for eligible family members of retirees buried in national, state veterans, military post or
base cemeteries. Family members buried in private cemeteries are not eligible for a headstone or marker.
Flat bronze, flat stone (white marble or light gray granite), or upright white marble headstones are avail-
able to mark the grave in a style consistent with the cemetery. Niche markers are available for urns.
    8.1. When burial is in a national cemetery, military post or base cemetery, or state veterans’ cemetery,
    the headstone or marker is ordered through the cemetery, and there is no cost to place it on the grave.
    Information on style, inscription, shipping and placement can be obtained from the cemetery.
    8.2. When burial is in a private cemetery, VA Form 40-1330, Application For Standard Govern-
    ment Headstone or Marker, must be submitted with copies of any official documents attesting to the
    retiree’s service in the Armed Forces (i.e., retirement order or DD Form 214, Certificate of Release
    or Discharge From Active Duty). The headstone or marker is shipped at government expense. How-
    ever, the VA does not pay the cost of placing the headstone or marker on the grave. To check on the
    status of your claim, you may call the VA toll free at 1-800-697-6947.

9. Military Honors. Active Air Force installations may provide military honors when requested by the
NOK consistent with available personnel and resources. Contact the installation Mortuary Affairs Office
nearest you, or Air Force Mortuary Affairs toll free at 1-800-531-5803, for specific information on mili-
tary honors for retirees.

Section D—Monetary Benefits

10. General Information. Family members of deceased retired personnel are eligible to receive several
types of federal benefits. Benefits to a spouse and children are paid regardless of economic need, except
in the case of a nonservice-connected death pension, while benefits for parents who might otherwise be
eligible will not be paid if the parents have income in excess of a certain amount each year. Your CAR, the
nearest VA or Social Security office will explain the benefits to you, determine the amounts that can be
paid, and help you complete the required claim forms.

11. Death Gratuity. A lump sum gratuitous payment made by the DFAS-CL Center to eligible benefi-
ciaries of a retiree who dies within 120 days following placement on the permanent or temporary disabil-
ity retired list, or who is retired for years of service. Payments can be made only after the VA determines
death was caused by an illness or injury incurred while the retiree was on active duty, active duty for train-
ing, or inactive duty for training. The death gratuity payment is $6,000, of which $3,000 is taxable
income. The claim forms required to apply for this benefit are DD Form 397, Claim Certification and
Voucher for Death Gratuity Payment, VA Form 21-534, Application for Dependency and Indemnity
Compensation (DIC) or Death Pension and Accrued Benefits by Surviving Spouse or Child, or VA
Form 21-535, Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation by Parent(s). The claim
forms and supporting documentation (i.e., marriage certificate, birth certificate, civilian court custodian-
ship certificate or guardianship order, etc.) should be mailed to your VARO for claim processing. Your
AFPAM36-3028 3 OCTOBER 2002                                                                                 9


CAR or the nearest VA office can explain this benefit and help you complete the required claim forms.
The death gratuity is not paid to any other person when there are no survivors as listed below. A will is not
a legal designation for death gratuity since such payment is not an allowance or a debt due the member
and cannot be part of the estate. The death gratuity payment is made to survivors of the deceased in this
order:
   11.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.
   11.2. When there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member, regardless of age or marital sta-
   tus, in equal shares (state laws guide payment to minor children).
   11.3. If none of the above, to the parents, siblings, or any combination as designated by the deceased
   member.

12. Unpaid Pay and Allowances. The retirement pay of an Air Force retired member stops on the first
day of the month in which the retiree died. Upon death of a retired member, any pay and allowances due
but not paid to the member are paid to the designated beneficiary named by the member prior to retire-
ment. Normally, this amounts to the retirement pay from the first day of the month of death through the
date of death. Retirement pay electronically deposited into an account held by a retiree will automatically
be recouped by DFAS-CL and reissued to the beneficiary for the correct amount. The claim form required
to apply for this benefit is Standard Form 1174, Claim for Unpaid Compensation of Deceased Member
of the Uniformed Services. Your CAR will help you complete the claim form. When the designated ben-
eficiary is deceased, or if the member elected “order of precedence,” any money due is paid to the first eli-
gible recipient in the following order:
   12.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.
   12.2. When there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member in equal shares, with the share
   of any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that child.
   12.3. If none of the above, to the parents of the member in equal shares or to the surviving parent.
   12.4. If none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the member’s estate.
   12.5. If none of the above, to the person(s) determined to be entitled under the laws of the state in
   which the member was domiciled.

13. Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI). Retirees are covered for 120 days following
retirement with no additional premium during the 120-day period. Retirees rated totally disabled on the
date of retirement retain SGLI coverage until the disability ceases to be total in degree, but not for more
than 1 year. Determination and payment of proceeds are made by the Office of Servicemembers’ Group
Life Insurance (OSGLI) under the jurisdiction of the VA. The claim form required to apply for this benefit
is VA Form SGLV 8283, Claim for Death Benefits. Your CAR or the nearest VA office can explain this
benefit to you and help you complete the required claim form, or you can write to the OSGLI, 290 West
Mt. Pleasant, Livingston, NJ 07039-2747 or call them toll free at 1-800-419-1473. Payment of proceeds
to a beneficiary is exempt from taxation. The insured member may have designated as principal or contin-
gent beneficiary any person, firm, corporation or legal entity, including his/her estate, individually or as a
trustee. If the member designated a trust, he/she indicated the name and date of the trust in the beneficiary
block. If the member designated a trust through a will, he/she annotated “Last Will and Testament” in the
beneficiary block. If the member chose not to designate a specific beneficiary but preferred the proceeds
10                                                                  AFPAM36-3028 3 OCTOBER 2002


be paid in the order of precedence, the member selected the “By Law” designation. When the “By Law”
designation is used, the proceeds are automatically paid in the following order of precedence:
     13.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.
     13.2. If there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member in equal shares, with the share of
     any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that child.
     13.3. If none of the above, to the parents of the member in equal shares or to the surviving parent.
     13.4. If none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the member’s estate.
     13.5. If none of the above, to the person(s) determined to be entitled under the laws of the state in
     which the member was domiciled.

14. Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI). This program allows retirees, upon retirement, to convert
their SGLI coverage during the first 120 days following retirement, or 1 year following retirement for
totally disabled retirees. VGLI is a 5-year renewable term policy, administered by the OSGLI under the
jurisdiction of the VA. VGLI is issued up to a maximum of $250,000 in $10,000 increments, but not for
more than the amount of SGLI the retiree had in force at time of retirement. If the retiree was covered
under VGLI, your CAR or nearest VA office can explain this benefit to you and help you complete the
required claim form, VA Form SGLV 8283, Claim for Death Benefits. You can write to the OSGLI, 290
West Mt. Pleasant, Livingston NJ 07039-2747 or call them toll free at 1-800-419-1473.

15. National Service Life Insurance (NSLI). Except for disability policies, no retiree has enrolled in
this program since 23 April 1951. If the retiree was covered, your CAR or the nearest VA office can
explain this benefit to you, help you complete the required claim form, VA Form 29-4125, Claim for One
Sum Payment, and mail it to the VARO and Insurance Center, Box 8079, Philadelphia, PA 19101 for pro-
cessing.

16. Service Disabled Veterans Insurance (SDVI). SDVI is insurance limited to veterans who left the
Service after 24 April 1951. A member who has a service-connected disability but is otherwise in good
health may apply to the VA for up to $10,000 in SDVI life insurance coverage at standard rates. Members
rated totally disabled by the VA may apply for a waiver of premiums. For those members eligible for this
waiver, additional coverage of up to $20,000 is available, but the premiums cannot be waived. If the
retiree was covered, your CAR or the nearest VA office can explain this benefit to you, help you complete
the required claim form, VA Form 29-4125, Claim for One Sum Payment, and mail it to the VARO and
Insurance Center, Box 8079, Philadelphia, PA 19101 for processing.

17. Retired Serviceman’s Family Protection Plan (RSFPP). The RSFPP program allowed personnel
who retired before 21 September 1972 to receive reduced retired pay in order to provide an annuity for
certain beneficiaries after the death of the retiree. Participation in this program was voluntary. If the
retiree elected to participate, your CAR can explain this benefit to you, help you complete the required
claim forms, DD Form 1884, Application for Annuity Under the Retired Serviceman’s Family Pro-
tection Plan (RSFPP) and/or Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP), TD Form W-4P, Withholding Certificate
for Pension or Annuity Payments, and SF 1199A, Direct Deposit Sign-Up Form, or FMS Form 2231,
FAST START DIRECT DEPOSIT, and forward them to the Defense Finance Accounting Ser-
vice-Cleveland Center (DFAS-CL) for processing. Mailing address for DFAS-CL is: Defense Finance and
Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY 47042-7131.
AFPAM36-3028 3 OCTOBER 2002                                                                                 11


   17.1. Remarriage Before Age 60 . Your RSFPP annuity ceases the first of the month in which you
   remarry. Notify DFAS-CL to prevent an overpayment of the annuity. If death or divorce terminates
   your marriage, the annuity cannot be reinstated. DFAS-CL will reinstate your RSFPP annuity only if
   you furnish documents verifying the annulment of a “void” marriage.
   17.2. Remarriage After Age 60. Your RSFPP annuity will continue without interruption if you
   remarry after age 60. You should send a copy of the marriage certificate with instructions for name
   and address changes to DFAS-CL at Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annu-
   itant Pay, P. O. Box 7131 London KY 47042-7131.

18. Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). SBP is a monthly annuity paid by the Air Force. This program allows
personnel who retired on or after 21 September 1972, or before if they enrolled in the program during an
open season, to receive reduced retired pay in order to provide a monthly annuity to their beneficiaries
after the death of the retiree. The retiree designates the beneficiaries. Participation in this program is vol-
untary. SBP provides an eligible surviving spouse or former spouse or, in some cases, eligible children,
financial security similar to the financial security a retiree had in retired pay—a cost-of-living-adjusted
monthly income for life.

19. Reserve Component Survivor Benefit Plan (RCSBP). RCSBP is a monthly annuity paid by the
Air Force to the surviving spouse or, in some cases, eligible children, of an Air Reserve Component mem-
ber who dies and has completed the satisfactory years of service to qualify the member for retired pay at
age 60. The retiree designates the beneficiaries. The beneficiary choices are the same as for SBP. Partici-
pation in the program is voluntary. A Reserve component member eligible for retired pay under Title 10,
United States Code, Section 12731, may also have survivor benefit coverage under his/her Civil Service
retirement income. There is no conflict of interest, which would prohibit simultaneous coverage. The
three options that are available to the member at time of election are:
   19.1. Option A. Member declines to make an election until age 60. If death occurs prior to age 60, no
   annuity is payable.
   19.2. Option B. Coverage provides for an annuity to begin on the 60th anniversary of member’s birth,
   if death occurs before age 60, or to begin immediately when death occurs after age 60.
   19.3. Option C. Coverage provides for an annuity to begin immediately, whether death occurs before
   or after age 60.

20. Supplemental Survivor Benefit Plan (SSBP) Retirees who elected SBP coverage for a spouse or
former spouse at the maximum level may have also elected an SBP annuity to supplement the 35 percent
SBP annuity payable when the spouse or former spouse reaches age 62. An SSBP annuity is an amount
equal to 5, 10, 15, or 20 percent of gross retired pay, according to the percentage of the SSBP that the
member elected.
   20.1. DELETED.
   20.2. DELETED.

21. SBP and RCSBP Factors:
   21.1. If the retiree elected to participate in SBP or RCSBP, they selected one of the election choices
   listed below:
12                                                                 AFPAM36-3028 3 OCTOBER 2002


     21.1.1. Spouse. To receive SBP annuity, a surviving spouse must have been married to the retiree
     on both the date he/she retired and the date the retiree died. If the marriage took place after the date
     of retirement, the spouse must have been married to the retiree for at least 1 year or be the parent
     of a child of the marriage. The annuity is paid until the spouse dies, but is suspended upon remar-
     riage before age 55. The annuity to a surviving spouse may be reinstated if the subsequent mar-
     riage ends in death or divorce. The annuitant must send a certified copy of the divorce decree or
     death certificate to DFAS-CL to reinstate the annuity. When a second SBP benefit results from the
     remarriage, the surviving spouse must elect which of the two SBP benefits to receive. Should the
     surviving spouse remarry at age 55 or older, the annuitant will continue to receive the monthly
     annuity. The surviving spouse must notify DFAS-CL of any marital changes by writing to Defense
     Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY
     40742-7131.
     21.1.2. Spouse and Child. The spouse is the primary beneficiary. Should the surviving spouse
     remarry before age 55, the annuity is paid in equal shares to eligible children under age 18, or
     under age 22 if a full-time student. The coverage stops when there are no eligible children. A
     dependent child may be an adopted child, stepchild, grandchild, foster child, or recognized natural
     child who lived with the member in a regular parent-child relationship. A child born or adopted
     after retirement is automatically covered if the member previously elected child coverage. A child
     disabled before age 18, or before age 22 if a full-time student when the disability occurred, is an
     eligible beneficiary so long as the disability exists and the child remains incapable of self-support.
     DFAS reinstates a child’s annuity when a child between the ages of 18 and 22 reenters school on a
     full-time basis, or a disabling condition recurs making the child incapable of self-support. The
     monthly annuity for children is 55 percent and is not reduced by Dependency and Indemnity Com-
     pensation (DIC) the VA awards or when a disabled child attains age 62. Marriage at any age termi-
     nates a child’s eligibility.
     21.1.3. Child. Covers only the retiree’s dependent children as stated in paragraph 21.1.2.
     21.1.4. Former Spouse. A former spouse election bars payment of an annuity to a surviving
     spouse. This option covers a former spouse if the retiree was required by court order, or spousal
     agreement, to provide an annuity to that former spouse, or if the retiree had elected to provide such
     an annuity. DFAS pays the annuity to the former spouse the retiree named as beneficiary who was
     the member’s former spouse at retirement, the member’s spouse beneficiary at retirement but
     divorced from the member after retirement, or married to the member after retirement for at least
     1 year before the divorce, or is the parent of a child born of the marriage. A surviving former
     spouse may remarry after age 55 and continue to receive the monthly annuity for life. If the former
     spouse remarries before age 55, the annuity is suspended, but may be reinstated if the subsequent
     marriage ends in divorce or death. The annuitant must send a certified copy of the divorce decree
     or death certificate to DFAS-CL to reinstate the annuity. The former spouse must notify DFAS-CL
     of any changes in marital status by writing to Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Mil-
     itary Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY 40742-7131-6000. The surviving former spouse
     must elect which of the two SBP benefits to receive.
     21.1.5. Former Spouse and Child. If the retiree elected former spouse and child coverage, only
     eligible children resulting from the marriage of the retiree and former spouse are eligible benefi-
     ciaries. The former spouse is the primary beneficiary. Should the surviving former spouse remarry
     before age 55, the annuity is paid in equal shares to eligible children under age 18, or under age 22
AFPAM36-3028 3 OCTOBER 2002                                                                               13


     if a full-time student. The coverage stops when there are no eligible children. A dependent child
     may be an adopted child, stepchild, grandchild, foster child, or recognized natural child who lived
     with the member in a regular parent-child relationship. A child disabled before age 18, or before
     age 22 if a full-time student when the disability occurred, is an eligible beneficiary so long as the
     disability exists and the child remains incapable of self-support. DFAS reinstates a child’s annuity
     when a child between the ages of 18 and 22 reenters school on a full-time basis, or a disabling con-
     dition recurs making the child incapable of self-support. The monthly annuity for children is 55
     percent and is not reduced by the amount of DIC the VA awards or when a disabled child attains
     age 62. Marriage at any age terminates a child’s eligibility.
     21.1.6. Insurable Interest. A person who stands to gain some financial benefit or advantage
     from the continuance of the retiree’s life. When the retiree was not married and had no children at
     the time of retirement, they could have elected coverage for an “insurable interest” person. This
     had to be a natural person (not a company, organization, fraternity, etc.) with a financial interest in
     the retiree’s life. It may be a close relative or a business partner. If the retiree was not married and
     had only one child, they could elect insurable interest coverage for that child regardless of the
     child’s age or dependency status. An SBP annuity for an insurable interest person is 55 percent of
     the monthly retired pay remaining after deduction of the monthly SBP premium.
  21.2. Level of Coverage. The SBP annuity a surviving spouse, former spouse, or children receive
  depends on the amount of retired pay (base amount) selected by the retiree as the basis for coverage.
  The base amount selected may be the retiree’s full monthly retired pay or just a portion, down to as
  little as $300. The base amount for SSBP or insurable interest coverage is the retiree’s gross retired
  pay. The value of the annuity increases by cost of living adjustments. Payments begin the day after the
  retiree’s death and stop on the last day of the month before the month that a survivor’s eligibility ends.
  21.3. Computations for Spouse and Former Spouse Annuity. DFAS-CL computes spouse and
  former spouse annuities under a two-tier system. The annuity is 55 percent of the base amount if the
  annuitant is under age 62 and later reduced to 35 percent on the first day of the month after the spouse
  or former spouse turns age 62. The annuity for a former spouse whose divorce was finalized before 30
  November 1989 is not reduced at age 62, when the member was retired or retirement eligible on or
  before 1 October 1985. When the member retired or was retirement eligible on or after 2 October
  1985, DFAS-CL computes the annuity for the surviving spouse or former spouse beneficiary, if
  divorced after 30 November 1989, under both the two-tier system and the Social Security offset sys-
  tem. The beneficiary receives an annuity from whichever system pays the greater benefit:
     21.3.1. Under the Social Security Offset System, the SBP annuity is reduced by the amount of
     Social Security the survivor would be entitled to receive based solely on the retiree’s military ser-
     vice performed after 1956. The offset may not exceed 40 percent of the value of the SBP annuity.
     21.3.2. The two-tier system affects all retirees initially becoming participants in the SBP on or
     after 2 October 1985, and applies only to spouse and former spouse annuity payments.
  21.4. Tax Implications. Survivor annuities and any cost refunds are taxable income. You will receive
  a tax statement from DFAS-CL at the end of the year. The statement will show the full amount of the
  annuity payments you received and the total amount of tax withheld during the year.
     21.4.1. Unless you elect otherwise, the amount of federal income tax withheld (FITW) will be as

        Annuity Payments, showing the changes, and mail it to Defense Finance and Accounting Ser-
        vice, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY 40742-7131-6000.
        21.4.2. DFAS-CL withholds a 30 percent federal income tax on annuities paid to nonresident
        aliens unless the beneficiary resides in a country that has a tax treaty with the United States speci-
        fying a different withholding rate. Address questions to the Internal Revenue Service, Assistant
        Commissioner (International), ATTN: IN:C:TPS, 950 L’Enfant Plaza South, SW, Washington DC
        20024-2123, or contact the nearest American Embassy.
        21.4.3. Annuities may be subject to federal estate taxes. Address tax questions to a legal assis-
        tance officer or the nearest Internal Revenue Service office.
     21.5. A certificate of continued eligibility form will be sent to you each year prior to your birthday.
     Complete and return the form promptly so DFAS-CL can continue your annuity without interruption.
     Read the instructions on the form and make sure you have completed it correctly. Sign and date the
     form and send it to Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box
     7131, London KY 40742-7131-6000.
     21.6. DIC Offset. DFAS-CL reduces a surviving spouse’s SBP annuity by the amount of DIC the VA
     awards and pays the surviving spouse based on the service-connected death of the retiree who pro-
     vided the SBP. When DIC exceeds the SBP amount, the spouse will receive all SBP premiums paid by
     the retiree. When the SBP annuity exceeds the DIC payment, the spouse will receive only the amount
     of SBP premiums paid for the portion of the SBP that is replaced by DIC.
        21.6.1. A spouse over age 55 who forfeits DIC by remarrying may have the SBP reinstated by
        repaying the costs that DFAS-CL refunded when the DIC was awarded. The reinstated SBP annu-
        ity is effective on the date the DIC expires. The survivor may repay the premiums in a lump sum
        or installments. DFAS-CL deducts installment payments from the SBP annuity.
        21.6.2. DIC does not offset an SSBP annuity.
        21.6.3. The SBP annuity is not reduced by the amount of a child’s DIC entitlement.
     21.7. Civil Service Employees. A member who retired from Civil Service and waived his/her mili-
     tary retired pay to combine civilian and military service credits could not participate in both SBP and
     the Civil Service survivor annuity program. The member had to decline the Civil Service survivor
     coverage and continue in the SBP, or participate in the Civil Service survivor program at any level and
     have SBP coverage suspended. If the waiver of military retired pay was terminated for any reason,
     SBP coverage was resumed when the member began to receive retired pay again.
        21.7.1. An SBP participant who did not waive military retired pay on retirement from Civil Ser-
        vice had to continue SBP participation. The member may also elect coverage under the Civil Ser-
        vice annuity plan and a survivor could receive annuities from both plans.
     21.8. If the retiree elected to participate in the SBP, your CAR can explain this benefit to you, help
     you complete the required claim forms, DD Form 1884, Application for Annuity Under the Retired
     Serviceman’s Family Protection Plan (RSFPP) and/or Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP), TD Form
     W-4P, Withholding Certificate for Pension or Annuity Payments, and SF 1199A, Direct Deposit
     Sign-Up Form, or FMS Form 2231, FAST START DIRECT DEPOSIT, and forward them to
     DFAS-DE/FRB for processing. DFAS-DE may require additional documents in order to establish an
     annuity (i.e., representative payee documentation; school certification for full-time student between
     ages 18 and 22; medical statement for child disabled prior to age 18, etc.). For additional information

22. Minimum Income Widow’s Benefit. The unremarried widow of a retiree who died before 21 March
1974 may receive a minimum income widow’s benefit. The widow must be receiving a VA widow’s non-
service-connected death pension and have a total annual income from all sources except the VA pension
that is less than an annual income level established by public law. For additional information and applica-
tion instructions, write to DFAS-CL at Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant
Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY 40742-7131. Unremarried widows whose income exceeds this level
may qualify for the “forgotten widows” benefit.

23. Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). DIC is payable by the VA to surviving spouses,
unmarried children under age 18, disabled children, children between the ages of 18 and 23 if attending a
VA-approved school, and low-income parents of retirees who die from a disease or injury incurred or
aggravated while on active duty or active duty for training, an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of
duty while on inactive duty training, or a disability otherwise compensable under laws administered by
the VA. DIC payments may also be authorized for the survivor of a retiree who had a service-connected
total disability at the time of death but whose death was not the result of his/her service-connected disabil-
ity. The survivor qualifies if the retiree was continuously rated totally disabled for a period of 10 or more
years immediately preceding death, the retiree was so rated for a period of not less than 5 years from the
date of discharge from military service. Payments under this provision are subject to offset by the amount
received from judicial proceedings brought on account of the retiree’s death. The monthly DIC rate paid
to a surviving spouse of a retiree who died prior to 1 January 1993 is based on the member’s military pay
grade, unless the monthly rate paid for deaths occurring after 1 January 1993 results in a greater monetary
benefit. The DIC rate paid for deaths occurring after 1 January 1993 is the same for all pay grades. The
DIC amount paid for a spouse with one or more children of the deceased retiree is increased for each
child. The amount of the DIC payment for parents varies according to the number of parents, the amount
of their individual or combined total annual income, and whether they live together or, if remarried, live
with a spouse. The surviving spouse and parents who receive DIC may be granted a special allowance for
aid and attendance if a patient is in a nursing home, disabled, or blind and requires the regular aid and
attendance of another person. If they are not so disabled as to require the regular aid and attendance of
another person but due to disability, are permanently housebound, they may be granted additional special
allowances. DIC payments to a surviving spouse are payable for life, as long as the spouse does not
remarry. Should the surviving spouse remarry, payments are terminated, but may be restored if the subse-
quent marriage ends in death, divorce or annulment. Your CAR or the nearest VA office will explain the
benefit to you, the amount that can be paid, and help you complete the required claim forms.
   23.1. The claim form required to apply for this benefit is VA Form 21-534, Application for Depen-
   dency and Indemnity Compensation or Death Pension Accrued Benefits by Surviving Spouse or
   Child, or VA Form 21-535, Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation by Par-
   ent(s).

24. Denial of Claim for DIC. If the VA denies your claim for DIC benefits, you may file an appeal with
the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. The appeal must be filed within 1 year from the date of notification of the
VA decision to file an appeal. The first step in the appeal process is to file a written notice of disagreement
with the VARO that made the decision. This is a written statement that you disagree with the VA’s deci-
sion. Following receipt of the written notice, the VA will furnish you a “Statement of the Case” describing
16                                                                   AFPAM36-3028 3 OCTOBER 2002


what facts, laws and regulations were used in deciding the case. To complete the request for appeal, you
must file a “Substantive Appeal’ within 60 days of the mailing of the “Statement of the Case, or within 1
year from the date the VA mailed its decision, whichever is later. Your CAR or the nearest VA office will
help you file a written notice of disagreement with the VARO that made the decision.

25. Nonservice-Connected Death Pension. If the VARO determines that you are not eligible for DIC,
you may be eligible to apply for a nonservice-connected death pension. Surviving spouses of deceased
members with wartime service and unmarried children under age 18, age 23 if attending a VA-approved
school, may be eligible for this pension if they meet income limitations prescribed by law. Qualifying
children who become incapable of self-support because of a disability before age 18 may be eligible for a
pension as long as the condition exists, unless the child marries or the child’s income exceeds the income
limit. The rate of pension depends on the amount of income the surviving spouse or child receives from
other sources. A pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is reasonable to assume
the estate will maintain them financially. Eligible survivors should make application through the local VA
office. The VA will determine your eligibility.

26. Veterans’ Educational Assistance Program (VEAP) and Montgomery GI Bill Refunds. I f t h e
retiree contributed to either of these programs, you may be entitled to a death refund. The refund is made
in “By Law” fashion to the spouse, children, and parents, and will not be paid to anyone else in the “By
Law” chain. If you are eligible to receive the death benefit refund, submit a letter, along with proof of rela-
tionship and a copy of the death certificate, or DD Form 1300, Report of Casualty, to the appropriate
VARO listed below. Your CAR or the nearest VA office can help you apply for a refund of contributions.
     26.1. Claims for the Montgomery GI Bill refund should be sent to the VARO, St. Louis Regional Pro-
     cessing Officer, ATTN: Chapter 30, Montgomery GI Bill, PO Box 66830, 331/225, St. Louis MO
     63103-6830.
     26.2. Claims for a VEAP refund should be sent to:
        26.2.1. Eastern Region (CT, DE, DC, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, OH PA, RI, VA, VT, WV, and
        Foreign Schools). VARO, PO Box 4616, Buffalo NY 14240-4616, ATTN: Chapter 30, Death Ben-
        efit.

        VARO, PO Box 8888, Muskogee OK 74402-8888, ATTN: Chapter 30, Death Benefit.

27. Social Security Payments. Social Security monthly benefits are paid to a spouse or a divorced
spouse, age 60 or over; a spouse or divorced spouse regardless of age with children of the decedent under
age 16 or disabled in their care and meeting Social Security requirements. A divorced spouse must have
been married to the service member at least 10 years. Monthly payments are also paid to children under
age 18, or under age 19, if a full-time student at a primary or secondary school, or age 18 or older and dis-
abled before age 18. Spouses who wait until age 65 to apply for Social Security receive maximum bene-
fits. However, they can receive reduced Social Security payments between ages 60 and 65. Dependent
AFPAM36-3028 3 OCTOBER 2002                                                                               17


parents are eligible for benefits at age 62 if they were more than 50 percent dependent on the deceased
service member for their support. The amount paid can only be determined by the Social Security Admin-
istration, which has a record of the wages earned by the retiree during the period of both military and
civilian employment under the Social Security Program. To apply for this benefit, eligible survivors must
make application through the nearest Social Security Office. They will explain the benefit, determine your
eligibility, the amount to be paid, and help you complete the required claim forms. Survivors should apply
early, as the law generally permits retroactive payments of 12 months.

28. Social Security Lump Sum Death Payment. The Social Security Administration pays a lump sum
death payment, up to $255, to the surviving spouse living with the member at the time of death. If there is
no surviving spouse, it is paid to the oldest child who was eligible for or entitled to Social Security bene-
fits during the month of the member’s death. No other survivors are entitled to this benefit. This benefit is
paid even if burial, funeral, or memorial benefits were paid by Air Force. To receive this benefit, eligible
survivors must make application through the nearest Social Security Office. This office will explain the
benefit, determine your eligibility, the amount to be paid, and help you complete the required claim forms.

Section E—Travel of Eligible Family Members and Shipment of Household Goods

29. Space Available Travel. Upon the death of a retired member, the retiree’s eligible family members
lose all entitlement to space-available travel.

30. Dependent Travel and Shipment of Household Goods. In most cases when a retiree dies, there are
no entitlements for shipment of household goods (HHG). However, if the retiree dies during the first year
following retirement of during an extension to the original entitlement the travel and transportation enti-
tlement goes to the dependents. Normally, a retiree’s entitlement to home of selection (HOS) travel and
transportation of HHG ends after one year unless it has been extended by the Joint Personal Property
Shipping Office-San Antonio (JPPSO-SAT), 613 Northwest Loop 410, Suite 400, San Antonio, TX
78216-5518 (medical and educational requests) or the Transition and Relocation Office at the Air Force
Personnel Center (AFPC/DPPTT), 550 C St. West Suite 11, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4713 (other
deserving cases). The Transportation Management Office can provide assistance in requesting an exten-
sion. Include a copy of the retiree’s death certificate or DD Form 1300 Report of Casualty (for retiree
deaths occurring within 120 days after retiring) and an explanation of the reason the extension is required.
Once HHG arrive at the requested destination further shipment is not authorized.

31. Storage in Transit. Storage in transit may be authorized at Air Force expense for up to 90 days in
connection with any authorized move. This storage is in connection with a shipment of household goods.
When, under certain conditions, the household goods cannot be withdrawn in the first 90 days, a request
for an additional 90 days storage should be made to the TMO controlling your storage account and with a
brief explanation for the reason the additional length of time for the storage is required. Temporary stor-
age is limited to 180 days.

32. Nontemporary Storage. The Air Force authorizes nontemporary storage for a period not to exceed 1
year from the date of retirement. Furniture may be stored in the vicinity of the place where the property is
located on the date of death. When property is overseas on the date of death, it will be returned to a
CONUS port of entry for nontemporary storage. Contact your TMO to arrange for this storage where the
property is located.

33. Claims for Loss or Destruction of Personal Property. If there is loss, damage, or destruction of
personal property, the NOK may be entitled to a monetary payment. This includes destruction of property
due to transportation of household goods and personal effects. If you believe you have such a claim, con-
tact the legal claims officer at the nearest military installation for assistance in filing your claims. You
must file a claim within 2 years of discovering the loss or damage.

Section F—Continued Service Benefits and Privileges

34. Basic Information. The loss of your loved one does not mean an end to certain military benefits and
privileges you now receive. You may continue to receive medical care at medical facilities of the Uni-
formed Services, in select former public health hospitals designated by the Department of Defense as Uni-
formed Services treatment facilities, and civilian inpatient and outpatient care, subject to limitations as
determined by local medical authorities. You may use the commissary, base exchange, and morale, wel-
fare and recreation activities, which includes theaters at bases where these facilities are available.
Although every effort is made to provide these benefits and privileges, at some installations the facilities
may be adequate only for the assigned military personnel and their eligible family members. In such
cases, the commander of the installation has the right to deny you the use of those facilities. In some over-
seas areas, the use of Service benefits and privileges may not be extended to families of deceased retirees
due to agreements entered into between the United States and the host country. If you plan to travel or live
abroad, let your CAR help you determine the benefits and privileges available in the country where you
plan to live. To determine if you are eligible for any of the Service benefits and privileges mentioned, read
the brief discussion of each below.

35. Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card (ID Card). The ID card is used as a means
of identification to determine eligibility for the following benefits and privileges: health benefits in Uni-
formed Services facilities and from civilian sources, commissary and base exchange privileges, and
admission to morale, welfare, and recreation activities, which include military theaters. Each card shows
the benefits and privileges authorized for the holder and allows the use of these benefits and privileges at
Uniformed Services installations where adequate services and facilities are available. This is the same
type of card you may now have. If this card was issued while the deceased retiree was living, it is no
longer valid. On the death of a retired member, the ID card held by their surviving family members must
be canceled and a new ID card issued. Your CAR will assist you in completing a DD Form 1172, Appli-
cation for Uniformed Services Identification Card-DEERS Enrollment, to obtain your new ID Card.
The card is issued to all eligible surviving family members 10 years of age or over who are eligible for one
or more of the Service benefits and privileges mentioned in this pamphlet. The card issued to the surviv-
ing spouse may identify children under 10 years of age. If the surviving spouse is deceased or not entitled,
the child under age 10 may be issued a separate card.

36. Medical and Dental Benefits. TRICARE. This is the Department of Defense managed health care
program designed to improve beneficiary access to care, assure affordable and high-quality care, provide
choice, and contain costs to beneficiaries and the Department of Defense. TRICARE offers eligible fam-
ily members a choice of the following health care options: Standard, Extra, Prime, Plus, and TRICARE
For Life. Each option has different cost-sharing features and degrees of freedom for using civilian provid-
ers. TRICARE Service Centers are established at or near each military installation to assist family mem-
bers in obtaining care and services as necessary. TRICARE does not cover dependent parents or
parents-in-law; however, they are eligible for medical care in the MTFs on a space-available basis and
AFPAM36-3028 3 OCTOBER 2002                                                                               19


may use the MTF pharmacy for military and civilian prescriptions within the formulary. For more detailed
information on TRICARE visit http://www.tricare.osd.mil, or contact the Beneficiary Counseling and
Assistance Coordinator at your nearest MTF. Where the TRICARE PRIME program is implemented, all
eligible beneficiaries can enroll. However, the military treatment facility (MTF) commander or other
authorized individual determine, based on availability or other operational requirements, when and
whether to offer the enrollment opportunity at the MTF. If there is not availability for you to enroll at the
MTF, you may choose to enroll with a civilian network provider. If you remarry someone outside the Uni-
formed Services, you are no longer covered. If the marriage is annulled, you may be eligible for reinstate-
ment after the annulment. TRICARE offers the following choices:
   36.1. TRICARE Standard. TRICARE Standard allows you to see an authorized health care provider
   of your choice, then either you or the provider file a claim for reimbursement by the regional TRI-
   CARE contractor. You will be required to pay a deductible and cost share.
       36.1.1. DELETED.
       36.1.2. DELETED.
       36.1.3. DELETED.
   36.2. TRICARE Extra. TRICARE Extra features health care providers who are part of an organized
   network, often known as a “preferred provider organization,” which treats TRICARE eligible
   patients. You get a discount on cost sharing and do not have to file claims yourself - the provider does
   this for you. You don’t enroll or pay an annual fee, but you do have to satisfy an annual deductible for
   outpatient care, just as you do under TRICARE Standard.
   36.3. TRICARE Prime. TRICARE Prime is a health maintenance organization-type option. Under
   this plan, which is currently the least costly health care option, you must get all of your care from the
   providers in the organization, for as long as you are enrolled. Your care is managed through a primary
   care manager whom you select or to whom you are assigned. Your primary care manager initiates, and
   the health care finder authorizes, all specialty referrals according to TRICARE contractor policies.
   Rather than paying deductibles and cost shares, you pay an annual enrollment fee and small pre-set
   fees, called co-payments, whenever you visit a civilian provider or get a prescription at a civilian phar-
   macy.
   36.4. TRICARE Plus. TRICARE Plus is an MTF primary care enrollment program offered at partic-
   ipating MTFs where capacity permits. The beneficiary must reside within the MTF catchment area.
   This option offers Prime-like access to the MTF with no enrollment fees. However, TRICARE Stan-
   dard/Extra cost shares or TRICARE for Life benefits apply to care received in civilian facilities. TRI-
   CARE Plus is not a portable benefit. Enrollment at one facility does not guarantee access at another
   facility.
   36.5. TRICARE For Life (TFL). TFL was passed by Congress as part of the FY 2001 National
   Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 106-398) and became Public Law on October 30, 2000. Implementa-
   tion by the Department of Defense (DoD) began on October 1, 2001. TFL restores TRICARE cover-
   age for all Medicare-eligible retired beneficiaries who are enrolled in Medicare Part B. Eligible
   beneficiaries will receive all Medicare-covered benefits under Medicare, plus all TRICARE covered
   benefits. For most beneficiaries who use a Medicare provider, Medicare will be first payer for all
   Medicare-covered services and TRICARE Standard will be second payer. TRICARE will pay all
   Medicare co pays and deductibles and cover most of the cost of certain care not covered by Medicare.
   TFL has no annual premiums and pays all Medicare co pays and deductibles. However, eligible bene-
20                                                                    AFPAM36-3028 3 OCTOBER 2002


     ficiaries must pay the monthly premium for Medicare Part B and any applicable TRICARE co pays
     for services covered by TRICARE but not Medicare, such as pharmacy services. For beneficiaries
     residing in foreign countries where Medicare coverage does not apply, TRICARE will be first payer,
     and beneficiaries will be responsible for the TRICARE Standard deductible and cost share not to
     exceed the annual catastrophic cap per family per year for TRICARE covered services. If you receive
     care from a civilian provider, your provider will file claims with Medicare. Medicare will pay its por-
     tion, then automatically forward the claim to TRICARE for the remaining amount. TRICARE will
     send its payment directly to your provider. You will receive an explanation of benefits (EOB) that
     indicates the amount paid to your provider. Additionally, TFL allows you to obtain low-cost prescrip-
     tion medications from the National Mail Order Pharmacy (NMOP) and TRICARE network and
     non-network civilian pharmacies. You may also continue to use MTF pharmacies.
     36.6. TRICARE Retiree Dental Program (TRDP). The TRDP is available to unremarried surviving
     spouses and eligible children of deceased retired members. The TRDP is a voluntary dental insurance
     program that is fully funded by the enrollee. Coverage is available throughout the 50 United States,
     the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Common-
     wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Canada. Benefits under the TRDP are comprehensive and
     include, but are not limited to: preventive, restorative (fillings), periodontics, prosthodontics (crowns,
     bridges, dentures), orthodontics, endodontics (root canals), and oral surgery. For more details, see
     http://www.tricare.osd.mil/tricare/beneficiary/supprog.html

37. Commissary Privileges. Subject to the installation commander’s determination of availability, the
unremarried or unmarried surviving spouse is eligible for commissary privileges. He or she may, with
approval of the local installation commander, let an agent make purchases under certain circumstances.
All members of the family living in the house may use purchases.

38. Base Exchange Privileges. Subject to the installation commander’s determination of availability, the
base exchange offers various services and facilities, depending on the base's population and what's avail-
able in the local civilian sector, such as theaters, barber shops, service stations, clothing stores, dry clean-
ing, optical shops, package stores, and other sales stores. The unremarried or unmarried surviving spouse
is eligible for base exchange services or, with approval of the installation commander, an agent may be
allowed to make purchases under certain circumstances.

39. Lodging. Subject to the installation commander’s determination of availability, eligible family mem-
bers may occupy lodging on a space-available basis when approved by the installation commander. Con-
tact the lodging office to determine the commander’s policy and to request accommodations. Family
members must have current ID cards.

40. Motion Picture Theater Privileges. Subject to the installation commander’s determination of avail-
ability, eligible family members can attend motion picture theaters on military installations. Family mem-
bers must have current ID cards.

41. Recreation Activities. Subject to the installation commander’s determination of availability, as an
unremarried or unmarried surviving spouse, you are entitled to membership in the Officers’ or Enlisted
Open Mess. The same applies to you and your children in the use of other recreational activities on a mil-
itary installation such as the golf course, fitness center, bowling alley, and hobby shops.

Section G—Miscellaneous Rights and Benefits

42. Basic Information. Eligible family members may be entitled to other federal and state rights and
benefits not in this pamphlet. Please read the brief description of each right or benefit. If you think you
may qualify for a benefit and are interested, ask your CAR or nearest VA office for more information.

43. Commercial Insurance. For commercial insurance, you should contact the nearest representative or
the home office of the company for settlement. Your CAR can advise you of any insurance allotments that
were being deducted from the member’s pay.

44. Emergency Financial Assistance. The Air Force Aid Society (AFAS) offers qualifying family
members financial assistance in the form of interest-free loans or grants during personal and family emer-
gencies. Aid may be given for such purposes as food, rent, utilities, essential car repair, and certain medi-
cal and dental care. The assistance is temporary and based on immediate need. The assistance is available
through the AFAS section located in the Family Support Center (FSC) at most Air Force installations. If
there is no AFAS office near you, the AFAS has cross-servicing assistance agreements with the American
Red Cross, Army Emergency Relief, and the Navy/Marine Corps Relief Society. Ask your CAR for addi-
tional details, or contact the base FSC.

45. Legal Assistance. Consultation and advice on all civil legal matters are provided to the retiree’s sur-
vivors on a space-available basis. Eligible family members may need or wish to obtain legal advice and
assistance in connection with settling the estate of the deceased member, making a new will for the sur-
viving spouse, taxation questions, and other related legal matters. Your CAR may put you in contact with
a legal assistance officer who can counsel you in these matters. The legal assistance officer can help in
preparing the initial income tax return but can only give preliminary advice on probate and settlement of
the estate, court appearances, preparation of inheritance tax returns, or in regard to civilian employment
and business matters. Since these matters are outside the scope of the Legal Assistance Program, it may
be necessary for survivors to obtain the services of civilian counsel. If you are not acquainted with an
attorney and want help in obtaining one, the legal assistance officer can refer you to such counsel through
the local bar association. Government agencies, such as the VA, Social Security Administration, and the
DFAS-CL and DFAS-DE Centers will help you in processing your claims for benefits and entitlements.
Such matters are expeditiously handled without resort to civilian counsel or expense to you. In case of fac-
tual disputes or conflicting claims, it might be wise to have civilian counsel.

46. Civilian Employment. If the retiree was employed after retirement from the Air Force, check with
his/her employer for possible company survivor benefits.

47. Civil Service Job Preference. A surviving spouse may be eligible to receive 10-point veterans’ ser-
vice preference for federal service employment if the deceased retiree served in wartime or in a peacetime
campaign or expedition for which the retiree received a campaign badge or service medal. You can obtain
information about this point preference and available federal employment from a federal Civilian Person-
nel Office.

48. State Benefits. Many states have passed laws providing certain rights, benefits, and privileges to the
surviving spouse and children of the deceased service member. These benefits include bonuses, educa-
tional assistance, employment opportunities, tax relief, and others. Seek further information on the laws

ans’ organizations, such as the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Disabled American Vet-
erans.

pensation payments; property, including cash money received as a gift under will provisions; and face
amount of all life insurance policies.

55. Educational Benefits. The Dependents’ Educational Assistance Program provides educational
opportunities for the surviving spouse, children between the ages of 18 and 26, and children under 18,
under certain conditions, of a retiree who dies from a service-related injury or illness. Eligible persons
may receive up to 45 months of schooling (or the equivalent if enrolled part-time) in VA-approved
schools and colleges. In addition to the Dependents’ Educational Assistance Program, various programs
are available to help children reach their educational goals. To obtain additional information, contact your
nearest VA office.

56. Scholarship Information. Many states, universities, and other groups sponsor scholarship programs
for the children of deceased service members, particularly those with wartime service. Contact your high
school guidance counselor and local library for further information.

57. Home Loan Guaranteed by the VA. An unremarried spouse of a retiree who died from a ser-
vice-connected injury or illness may be eligible for a government-insured home loan benefit. To deter-
mine your eligibility, apply to the nearest VA office.

of accounts to the survivor's name. Also, ask about any insurance associated with the accounts.

Section H—Family Support Center (FSC)

59. Retiree Activities Office. Most Air Force installations have dedicated groups of retired military
members and spouses who donate their time and talents at Retiree Activities Offices (RAOs). These vol-
unteers have resources and time to provide survivors with assistance other than those provided by the
local CAR. Since volunteers staff the RAO, office hours vary, but their phone number is listed with the
base operator.

60. Family Support Center (FSC). The FSC is a service organization for Air Force families and a focal
point for family matters. They provide immediate, short-term support to help families with challenging
life situations. They help family members identify and clarify needs, determine appropriate forms of
assistance and provide linkage to those resources. Appropriate referral is ensured through follow-up. In
addition, they provide a range of prevention and enrichment services designed to help family members
adapt to current and future changes in their lives. These programs are presented at the FSC by staff mem-
bers, other base agencies or by agencies from the local civilian community.

13. Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI). Retirees are covered for 120 days following retire-
ment with no additional premium during the 120-day period. Retirees rated totally disabled on the date of
retirement retain SGLI coverage until the disability ceases to be total in degree, but not for more than 1
year. Determination and payment of proceeds are made by the Office of Servicemembers’ Group Life
Insurance (OSGLI) under the jurisdiction of the VA. The claim form required to apply for this benefit is
VA Form SGLV 8283, Claim for Death Benefits. Your CAR or the nearest VA office can explain this
benefit to you and help you complete the required claim form, or you can write to the OSGLI, 290 West
Mt. Pleasant, Livingston, NJ 07039-2747 or call them toll free at 1-800-419-1473. Payment of proceeds
to a beneficiary is exempt from taxation. The insured member may have designated as principal or contin-
gent beneficiary any person, firm, corporation or legal entity, including his/her estate, individually or as a
trustee. If the member designated a trust, he/she indicated the name and date of the trust in the beneficiary
block. If the member designated a trust through a will, he/she annotated “Last Will and Testament” in the
beneficiary block. If the member chose not to designate a specific beneficiary but preferred the proceeds
be paid in the order of precedence, the member selected the “By Law” designation. When the “By Law”
designation is used, the proceeds are automatically paid in the following order of precedence:


14. Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI). This program allows retirees, upon retirement, to convert
their SGLI coverage during the first 120 days following retirement, or 1 year following retirement for

totally disabled retirees. VGLI is a 5-year renewable term policy, administered by the OSGLI under the
jurisdiction of the VA. VGLI is issued up to a maximum of $250,000 in $10,000 increments, but not for
more than the amount of SGLI the retiree had in force at time of retirement. If the retiree was covered
under VGLI, your CAR or nearest VA office can explain this benefit to you and help you complete the
required claim form, VA Form SGLV 8283, Claim for Death Benefits. You can write to the OSGLI, 290
West Mt. Pleasant, Livingston NJ 07039-2747 or call them toll free at 1-800-419-1473.


17. Retired Serviceman’s Family Protection Plan (RSFPP). The RSFPP program allowed personnel
who retired before 21 September 1972 to receive reduced retired pay in order to provide an annuity for
certain beneficiaries after the death of the retiree. Participation in this program was voluntary. If the
retiree elected to participate, your CAR can explain this benefit to you, help you complete the required
claim forms, DD Form 1884, Application for Annuity Under the Retired Serviceman’s Family Pro-
tection Plan (RSFPP) and/or Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP), TD Form W-4P, Withholding Certificate
for Pension or Annuity Payments, and SF 1199A, Direct Deposit Sign-Up Form, or FMS Form 2231,
FAST START DIRECT DEPOSIT, and forward them to the Defense Finance Accounting Ser-
vice-Cleveland Center (DFAS-CL) for processing. Mailing address for DFAS-CL is: Defense Finance and
Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY 47042-7131.


17.1. Remarriage Before Age 60. Your RSFPP annuity ceases the first of the month in which you
remarry. Notify DFAS-CL to prevent an overpayment of the annuity. If death or divorce terminates your
marriage, the annuity cannot be reinstated. DFAS-CL will reinstate your RSFPP annuity only if you fur-
nish documents verifying the annulment of a “void” marriage.


17.2. Remarriage After Age 60. Your RSFPP annuity will continue without interruption if you remarry
after age 60. You should send a copy of the marriage certificate with instructions for name and address
changes to DFAS-CL at Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O.
Box 7131 London KY 47042-7131.


20. Supplemental Survivor Benefit Plan (SSBP) Retirees who elected SBP coverage for a spouse or
former spouse at the maximum level may have also elected an SBP annuity to supplement the 35 percent
SBP annuity payable when the spouse or former spouse reaches age 62. An SSBP annuity is an amount
equal to 5, 10, 15, or 20 percent of gross retired pay, according to the percentage of the SSBP that the
member elected.


20.1. DELETED.


20.2. DELETED.


21.1.1. Spouse. To receive SBP annuity, a surviving spouse must have been married to the retiree on both
the date he/she retired and the date the retiree died. If the marriage took place after the date of retirement,
AFPAM36-3028 3 OCTOBER 2002                                                                                 35


the spouse must have been married to the retiree for at least 1 year or be the parent of a child of the mar-
riage. The annuity is paid until the spouse dies, but is suspended upon remarriage before age 55. The
annuity to a surviving spouse may be reinstated if the subsequent marriage ends in death or divorce. The
annuitant must send a certified copy of the divorce decree or death certificate to DFAS-CL to reinstate the
annuity. When a second SBP benefit results from the remarriage, the surviving spouse must elect which of
the two SBP benefits to receive. Should the surviving spouse remarry at age 55 or older, the annuitant will
continue to receive the monthly annuity. The surviving spouse must notify DFAS-CL of any marital
changes by writing to Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box
7131, London KY 40742-7131.


21.1.2. Spouse and Child. The spouse is the primary beneficiary. Should the surviving spouse remarry
before age 55, the annuity is paid in equal shares to eligible children under age 18, or under age 22 if a
full-time student. The coverage stops when there are no eligible children. A dependent child may be an
adopted child, stepchild, grandchild, foster child, or recognized natural child who lived with the member
in a regular parent-child relationship. A child born or adopted after retirement is automatically covered if
the member previously elected child coverage. A child disabled before age 18, or before age 22 if a
full-time student when the disability occurred, is an eligible beneficiary so long as the disability exists and
the child remains incapable of self-support. DFAS reinstates a child’s annuity when a child between the
ages of 18 and 22 reenters school on a full-time basis, or a disabling condition recurs making the child
incapable of self-support. The monthly annuity for children is 55 percent and is not reduced by Depen-
dency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) the VA awards or when a disabled child attains age 62. Mar-
riage at any age terminates a child’s eligibility.


21.1.4. Former Spouse. A former spouse election bars payment of an annuity to a surviving spouse. This
option covers a former spouse if the retiree was required by court order, or spousal agreement, to provide
an annuity to that former spouse, or if the retiree had elected to provide such an annuity. DFAS pays the
annuity to the former spouse the retiree named as beneficiary who was the member’s former spouse at
retirement, the member’s spouse beneficiary at retirement but divorced from the member after retirement,
or married to the member after retirement for at least 1 year before the divorce, or is the parent of a child
born of the marriage. A surviving former spouse may remarry after age 55 and continue to receive the
monthly annuity for life. If the former spouse remarries before age 55, the annuity is suspended, but may
be reinstated if the subsequent marriage ends in divorce or death. The annuitant must send a certified copy
of the divorce decree or death certificate to DFAS-CL to reinstate the annuity. The former spouse must
notify DFAS-CL of any changes in marital status by writing to Defense Finance and Accounting Service,
U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY 40742-7131-6000. The surviving former
spouse must elect which of the two SBP benefits to receive.


21.1.5. Former Spouse and Child. If the retiree elected former spouse and child coverage, only eligible
children resulting from the marriage of the retiree and former spouse are eligible beneficiaries. The
former spouse is the primary beneficiary. Should the surviving former spouse remarry before age 55, the
annuity is paid in equal shares to eligible children under age 18, or under age 22 if a full-time student. The
coverage stops when there are no eligible children. A dependent child may be an adopted child, stepchild,
grandchild, foster child, or recognized natural child who lived with the member in a regular parent-child

relationship. A child disabled before age 18, or before age 22 if a full-time student when the disability
occurred, is an eligible beneficiary so long as the disability exists and the child remains incapable of
self-support. DFAS reinstates a child’s annuity when a child between the ages of 18 and 22 reenters school
on a full-time basis, or a disabling condition recurs making the child incapable of self-support. The
monthly annuity for children is 55 percent and is not reduced by the amount of DIC the VA awards or
when a disabled child attains age 62. Marriage at any age terminates a child’s eligibility.


21.1.6. Insurable Interest. A person who stands to gain some financial benefit or advantage from the
continuance of the retiree’s life. When the retiree was not married and had no children at the time of retire-
ment, they could have elected coverage for an “insurable interest” person. This had to be a natural person
(not a company, organization, fraternity, etc.) with a financial interest in the retiree’s life. It may be a close
relative or a business partner. If the retiree was not married and had only one child, they could elect insur-
able interest coverage for that child regardless of the child’s age or dependency status. An SBP annuity for
an insurable interest person is 55 percent of the monthly retired pay remaining after deduction of the
monthly SBP premium.


21.3. Computations for Spouse and Former Spouse Annuity. DFAS-CL computes spouse and former
spouse annuities under a two-tier system. The annuity is 55 percent of the base amount if the annuitant is
under age 62 and later reduced to 35 percent on the first day of the month after the spouse or former
spouse turns age 62. The annuity for a former spouse whose divorce was finalized before 30 November
1989 is not reduced at age 62, when the member was retired or retirement eligible on or before 1 October
1985. When the member retired or was retirement eligible on or after 2 October 1985, DFAS-CL com-
putes the annuity for the surviving spouse or former spouse beneficiary, if divorced after 30 November
1989, under both the two-tier system and the Social Security offset system. The beneficiary receives an
annuity from whichever system pays the greater benefit:


21.4. Tax Implications. Survivor annuities and any cost refunds are taxable income. You will receive a
tax statement from DFAS-CL at the end of the year. The statement will show the full amount of the annu-
ity payments you received and the total amount of tax withheld during the year.


21.4.1. Unless you elect otherwise, the amount of federal income tax withheld (FITW) will be as if you
were a married individual claiming three exemptions. If you want your FITW changed at a later date, you
must complete a new TD-Form W-4P, Withholding Certificate for Pension or Annuity Payments,
showing the changes, and mail it to Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant
Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY 40742-7131-6000.


21.4.2. DFAS-CL withholds a 30 percent federal income tax on annuities paid to nonresident aliens unless
the beneficiary resides in a country that has a tax treaty with the United States specifying a different with-
holding rate. Address questions to the Internal Revenue Service, Assistant Commissioner (International),
ATTN: IN:C:TPS, 950 L’Enfant Plaza South, SW, Washington DC 20024-2123, or contact the nearest
American Embassy.
AFPAM36-3028 3 OCTOBER 2002                                                                               37



21.4.3. Annuities may be subject to federal estate taxes. Address tax questions to a legal assistance officer
or the nearest Internal Revenue Service office.


21.5. A certificate of continued eligibility form will be sent to you each year prior to your birthday. Com-
plete and return the form promptly so DFAS-CL can continue your annuity without interruption. Read the
instructions on the form and make sure you have completed it correctly. Sign and date the form and send
it to Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY
40742-7131-6000.


21.6. DIC Offset. DFAS-CL reduces a surviving spouse’s SBP annuity by the amount of DIC the VA
awards and pays the surviving spouse based on the service-connected death of the retiree who provided
the SBP. When DIC exceeds the SBP amount, the spouse will receive all SBP premiums paid by the
retiree. When the SBP annuity exceeds the DIC payment, the spouse will receive only the amount of SBP
premiums paid for the portion of the SBP that is replaced by DIC.


21.6.1. A spouse over age 55 who forfeits DIC by remarrying may have the SBP reinstated by repaying
the costs that DFAS-CL refunded when the DIC was awarded. The reinstated SBP annuity is effective on
the date the DIC expires. The survivor may repay the premiums in a lump sum or installments. DFAS-CL
deducts installment payments from the SBP annuity.


22. Minimum Income Widow’s Benefit. The unremarried widow of a retiree who died before 21 March
1974 may receive a minimum income widow’s benefit. The widow must be receiving a VA widow’s non-
service-connected death pension and have a total annual income from all sources except the VA pension
that is less than an annual income level established by public law. For additional information and applica-
tion instructions, write to DFAS-CL at Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant
Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY 40742-7131. Unremarried widows whose income exceeds this level
may qualify for the “forgotten widows” benefit.


36. Medical and Dental Benefits. TRICARE. This is the Department of Defense managed health care
program designed to improve beneficiary access to care, assure affordable and high-quality care, provide
choice, and contain costs to beneficiaries and the Department of Defense. TRICARE offers eligible fam-
ily members a choice of the following health care options: Standard, Extra, Prime, Plus, and TRICARE
For Life. Each option has different cost-sharing features and degrees of freedom for using civilian provid-
ers. TRICARE Service Centers are established at or near each military installation to assist family mem-
bers in obtaining care and services as necessary. TRICARE does not cover dependent parents or
parents-in-law; however, they are eligible for medical care in the MTFs on a space-available basis and
may use the MTF pharmacy for military and civilian prescriptions within the formulary. For more detailed
information on TRICARE visit http://www.tricare.osd.mil, or contact the Beneficiary Counseling and
Assistance Coordinator at your nearest MTF. Where the TRICARE PRIME program is implemented, all
eligible beneficiaries can enroll. However, the military treatment facility (MTF) commander or other
38                                                                  AFPAM36-3028 3 OCTOBER 2002


authorized individual determine, based on availability or other operational requirements, when and
whether to offer the enrollment opportunity at the MTF. If there is not availability for you to enroll at the
MTF, you may choose to enroll with a civilian network provider. If you remarry someone outside the Uni-
formed Services, you are no longer covered. If the marriage is annulled, you may be eligible for reinstate-
ment after the annulment. TRICARE offers the following choices:
36.1. TRICARE Standard. TRICARE Standard allows you to see an authorized health care provider of
your choice, then either you or the provider file a claim for reimbursement by the regional TRICARE con-
tractor. You will be required to pay a deductible and cost share.


36.1.1. DELETED.


36.1.2. DELETED.


36.1.3. DELETED.


36.2. TRICARE Extra. TRICARE Extra features health care providers who are part of an organized net-
work, often known as a “preferred provider organization,” which treats TRICARE eligible patients. You
get a discount on cost sharing and do not have to file claims yourself - the provider does this for you. You
don’t enroll or pay an annual fee, but you do have to satisfy an annual deductible for outpatient care, just
as you do under TRICARE Standard.


36.3. TRICARE Prime. TRICARE Prime is a health maintenance organization-type option. Under this
plan, which is currently the least costly health care option, you must get all of your care from the provid-
ers in the organization, for as long as you are enrolled. Your care is managed through a primary care man-
ager whom you select or to whom you are assigned. Your primary care manager initiates, and the health
care finder authorizes, all specialty referrals according to TRICARE contractor policies. Rather than pay-
ing deductibles and cost shares, you pay an annual enrollment fee and small pre-set fees, called co-pay-
ments, whenever you visit a civilian provider or get a prescription at a civilian pharmacy.


36.4. TRICARE Plus. TRICARE Plus is an MTF primary care enrollment program offered at participat-
ing MTFs where capacity permits. The beneficiary must reside within the MTF catchment area. This
option offers Prime-like access to the MTF with no enrollment fees. However, TRICARE Standard/Extra
cost shares or TRICARE for Life benefits apply to care received in civilian facilities. TRICARE Plus is
not a portable benefit. Enrollment at one facility does not guarantee access at another facility.


36.5. TRICARE For Life (TFL). TFL was passed by Congress as part of the FY 2001 National Defense
Authorization Act (P.L. 106-398) and became Public Law on October 30, 2000. Implementation by the
Department of Defense (DoD) began on October 1, 2001. TFL restores TRICARE coverage for all Medi-
care-eligible retired beneficiaries who are enrolled in Medicare Part B. Eligible beneficiaries will receive
all Medicare-covered benefits under Medicare, plus all TRICARE covered benefits. For most beneficia-
AFPAM36-3028 3 OCTOBER 2002                                                                             39


ries who use a Medicare provider, Medicare will be first payer for all Medicare-covered services and TRI-
CARE Standard will be second payer. TRICARE will pay all Medicare co pays and deductibles and cover
most of the cost of certain care not covered by Medicare. TFL has no annual premiums and pays all Medi-
care co pays and deductibles. However, eligible beneficiaries must pay the monthly premium for Medi-
care Part B and any applicable TRICARE co pays for services covered by TRICARE but not Medicare,
such as pharmacy services. For beneficiaries residing in foreign countries where Medicare coverage does
not apply, TRICARE will be first payer, and beneficiaries will be responsible for the TRICARE Standard
deductible and cost share not to exceed the annual catastrophic cap per family per year for TRICARE cov-
ered services. If you receive care from a civilian provider, your provider will file claims with Medicare.
Medicare will pay its portion, then automatically forward the claim to TRICARE for the remaining
amount. TRICARE will send its payment directly to your provider. You will receive an explanation of
benefits (EOB) that indicates the amount paid to your provider. Additionally, TFL allows you to obtain
low-cost prescription medications from the National Mail Order Pharmacy (NMOP) and TRICARE net-
work and non-network civilian pharmacies. You may also continue to use MTF pharmacies.


36.6. TRICARE Retiree Dental Program (TRDP). The TRDP is available to unremarried surviving
spouses and eligible children of deceased retired members. The TRDP is a voluntary dental insurance pro-
gram that is fully funded by the enrollee. Coverage is available throughout the 50 United States, the Dis-
trict of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands, and Canada. Benefits under the TRDP are comprehensive and include, but
are not limited to: preventive, restorative (fillings), periodontics, prosthodontics (crowns, bridges, den-
tures), orthodontics, endodontics (root canals), and oral surgery. For more details, see
http://www.tricare.osd.mil/tricare/beneficiary/supprog.html


53. Air Force Enlisted Foundation, Inc. (formerly the Air Force Men’s Widows and Dependents
Home Foundation) Provides housing and services for widowed spouses over age 55 of Air Force enlisted
members. Younger applicants in need, whose sponsor dies or is killed on active duty may be admitted for
up to 1 year. Dependent parents of active duty members are also eligible for permanent residency. Finan-
cial assistance is available for those who qualify. For more information, call 1-800-258-1413, visit their
website at http://www.afenlistedwidows.org, or write Air Force Enlisted Foundation, Inc., 93 Sunset
Lane, Shalimar FL 32579.


59. Retiree Activities Office. Most Air Force installations have dedicated groups of retired military
members and spouses who donate their time and talents at Retiree Activities Offices (RAOs). These vol-
unteers have resources and time to provide survivors with assistance other than those provided by the
local CAR. Since volunteers staff the RAO, office hours vary, but their phone number is listed with the
base operator.


60. Family Support Center (FSC). The FSC is a service organization for Air Force families and a focal
point for family matters. They provide immediate, short-term support to help families with challenging
life situations. They help family members identify and clarify needs, determine appropriate forms of
assistance and provide linkage to those resources. Appropriate referral is ensured through follow-up. In
addition, they provide a range of prevention and enrichment services designed to help family members

bers, other base agencies or by agencies from the local civilian community.
