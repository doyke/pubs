SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision updates references/terms throughout as well as in the standardized form letters for
reporting self-inspection results to wing and group command agencies. This revision also
removes the requirements leveled against tenant organizations.
1. Purpose:
   1.1. The purpose of this instruction is to assist 354 FW units in conducting self-inspections.
 2                                                                354FWI 90-202 25 MAY 2011


     1.2. All units within the 354 FW will conduct unit self-inspections during the months of
     January and July. Attachments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will be used as standardized templates
     throughout the wing. The objective of unit self-inspections and unit compliance inspections
     is to identify deficiencies which preclude or inhibit mission accomplishment. The primary
     focus of the self-inspection program is to ensure compliance with established directives,
     instructions, laws, executive orders, and safety directives to assure sustained performance
     toward mission accomplishment.
     1.3. All 354 FW assigned units are subject to external compliance inspections at any time.
     354 FW/IGI must be notified when validation inspections are planned.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. The primary responsibility for implementing the self-inspection program rests with the
     unit/squadron commander.
     2.2. The 354th Medical Group (MDG) will conduct self-inspections IAW HQ AFIA,
     Directorate of Medical Operations Health Services Inspection Agency, and will meet civilian
     standards of health care through self-inspections. The 354 MDG will also conduct self-
     inspections to meet commander's support staff administrative requirements IAW applicable
     compliance checklists and the 354 FW Self-Inspection program.
     2.3. Unit Self-Inspection Monitors:
        2.3.1. Maintain a self-inspection book as outlined in Table l.

Table 1. Self-Inspection Book Outline.
 SECTION A -            GOVERNING DIRECTIVES (includes this instruction and equivalent
                        HHQ instructions)
 SECTION B -            APPOINTMENT LETTERS
 SECTION C -            LAST TWO UNIT SELF-INSPECTION REPORTS (sent to GP/CC)
 SECTION D -            OPEN ITEMS REPORT (printed from I/E database)
                        CLOSED ITEMS SUMMARY (Attachment 6)
 SECTION E -            INSPECTION CHECKLISTS (listing of checklist and where found)
 SECTION F -            SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS (SII)
 SECTION G -            MAJOR GRADED AREA (MGA) (AFI 90-201
                        chapter 3)
 SECTION H - Z -        (UNIT DETERMINED)
        2.3.2. Ensure information located in the self-inspection book is current or list a reference
        where the information is located electronically (e.g. web page, electronic file plan).
        2.3.3. Ensure each new section chief reviews the most recent self-inspection of his or her
        duty section within 60 days of arrival.
        2.3.4. Ensure the Inspections/Exercises database is being updated with all OPEN
        checklist items. When evaluating checklist items, if the answer is YES, the self-
        inspection monitor will document the inspection item explaining how the criteria is met
        before the item will be considered CLOSED. A suggested table format for these
354FWI 90-202 25 MAY 2011                                                                      3


     documentations can be found in Attachment 6. Items answered NO will be considered
     OPEN and tracked in the Inspections/Exercises database and Section D of the self-
     inspection book. Items not applicable (N/A) to the unit/squadron will be considered
     CLOSED. In the case of multi-part questions, if any part is NO the overall checklist item
     is considered OPEN.
     2.3.5. Review and update any ORI, CI, or SAV inspection findings identified as OPEN
     in the Inspections/Exercises database from the last HQ PACAF or command level
     inspection.
     2.3.6. Compile all self-inspection results and submit to the unit/squadron commander for
     review semiannually after completing the unit self inspections in January and July.
     2.3.7. Serve as Special Interest Item (SII) monitor for all SIIs published/released by Air
     Force, MAJCOM, or other HHQ agencies. Report SII checklist results to 354 FW/IGI
     for further transmittal to MAJCOM within specified timeframes outlined in each
     individual SII.
  2.4. Squadron/Unit Commanders and Wing Staff Agencies:
     2.4.1. Appoint primary and alternate unit self-inspection monitors. Provide an updated
     appointment letter (Attachment 1) to 354 FW/IGI annually, NLT 31 January of each year,
     and whenever the monitors change.
     2.4.2. Provide a consolidated, semiannual summary to group commanders NLT 31
     January and      31 July each year using the form letter in Attachment 2. Wing Staff
     Agencies will provide their results directly to the 354 FW/IGI. Ensure open items
     requiring more than 90 days to close or beyond the squadron/unit’s ability to fix are
     entered/updated in the Inspection/Exercises database. Additionally any deficiencies with
     the SIIs or Major Graded Areas (MGAs) inspected will also be entered/updated in the
     Inspection/Exercises database. OPEN items will be updated every 90 days and on
     subsequent self-inspections.
     2.4.3. Monitor all discrepancies and open items and identify a schedule for resolution.
     2.4.4. Conduct periodic self-inspection validation (SIV) of the units’ self-inspection
     program.
  2.5. Group Commanders:
     2.5.1. Provide 354 FW/IGI a consolidated, semiannual summary of the group’s self-
     inspection results NLT 15 February and 15 August of each year using the form letter in
     Attachment 3. Ensure open items requiring more than 90 days to close or beyond the
     squadron/unit’s ability to fix are entered/updated in the Inspections/Exercises database.
     Additional deficiencies with SIIs or MGAs inspected areas will be entered/updated in the
     same database. OPEN items will be updated every 90 days and on subsequent self-
     inspections.
     2.5.2. Conduct periodic validation inspections of assigned units’ self-inspection program.
  2.6. Wing Inspection Office (354 FW/IGI):
     2.6.1. Administer the 354 FW unit compliance inspection program by providing
     guidance for the conduct of self-inspections.
 4                                                                354FWI 90-202 25 MAY 2011


        2.6.2. Collect self-inspection reports for all wing staff agencies and generate a
        consolidated report to be forwarded to the 354 FW/CC using the form letter in
        Attachment 4.
        2.6.3. Provide the 354 FW/CC with a consolidated, semiannual summary of the wing’s
        self-inspection results using the form letter in Attachment 5. The status of items
        requiring more than 90 days to fix, beyond the group’s ability to resolve and/or requiring
        help outside the wing to resolve, and deficiencies with the SIIs or MGAs, will be
        available for review upon request of the 354 FW/CC.
        2.6.4. Validate the results of unit self inspection results as required or when requested by
        unit leadership.
3. Source Documents:
     3.1. The baseline mission performance checklist can be found on the Air Force Inspection
     Agency web page at: https://webapps.afrc.af.mil/afia/CIHome.aspx?Type=UCI. MGAs
     are listed in chapter 3 of AFI 90-201, and can be found on the e-publications web site:
     http://www.e-publishing.af.mil. Checklist items that are out of date or incorrect should be
     resolved directly with the staff agency responsible for that checklist. Location and
     instruction for the use of the 354 FW Inspection/Exercises Database can be obtained from the
     354 FW/IGI office. PACAF may issue supplemented performance checklists. This guidance
     is normally available on the PACAF IGI web site and may also be available on the A staff
     website that is responsible for a given unit.
     3.2. Items listed on the Air Force or PACAF Mission Performance Checklists do not
     constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection/assessment. Units are encouraged to
     supplement the Mission Performance Checklists to add internal compliance items. Mission
     critical checklist items will be distinctly marked with a “#” annotation. These checklists may
     be used in whole or in part during HHQ inspection visits or exercises.
     3.3. Tasked units/staff agencies may prepare internal instructions and procedures to meet
     and supplement the objectives of this instruction.
