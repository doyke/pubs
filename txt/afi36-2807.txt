                                    GRAY EAGLE AWARD

2.1. Introduction. This chapter provides procedures for the Gray Eagle Award, assigns
appropriate responsibilities, and establishes selection criteria. All Air Force general officer line
pilots currently on active duty are eligible. Eligible general officers in the Air Reserve
Component (ARC) (Air National Guard [ANG] and Air Force Reserve Command [AFRC]) must
be on extended active duty (EAD).
2.2. Background of Award. The Gray Eagle Award is presented annually to honor the US Air
Force general officer pilot with the longest period of continuous aviation service.
2.3. Purpose of Award. This award recognizes the long service, depth of experience, and broad
aviation knowledge of senior Air Force pilots. By honoring the pilot with the longest continuous
aviation service, the Air Force reinforces the camaraderie and heritage within the pilot fraternity,
recognizes the distinct accomplishments of Air Force pilots, and highlights the total force
strength of the United States Air Force. Senior pilots set an example for those who follow, and
this award recognizes their leadership and achievements.
2.4. Description of the Award. The award consists of two elements: a permanent trophy on
display at Headquarters Air Force and a miniature replica presented to the recipient. The name of
the winner will be engraved on the permanent trophy.
2.5. Responsibilities.
   2.5.1. AF Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, Plans and Requirements (AF/A3/5) administer
   the award. AF/A3/5 maintains the precedence list for prospective Gray Eagles according to
   eligibility criteria based on aviation service data (date of original rating) and advises the
   Chief of Staff when the award is to be transferred.
   2.5.2. AF Deputy Chief of Staff, Manpower and Personnel (AF/A1) maintains personnel
   data to determine eligible candidates.
   2.5.3. The Secretary of the Air Force, Office of Public Affairs (SAF/PA) prepares a public
   release announcement as required.
   2.5.4. Air Force Protocol (AF/CVAP) maintains and updates the Gray Eagle Trophy on

   2.5.5. AF Executive Review Secretariat (AF/CVAS) arranges presentation of the award as a
   Corona Top agenda item.
2.6. Eligibility Criteria. All active duty Air Force general officer line pilots are eligible.
Longevity is based on the date pilot wings were awarded (date of original rating). The general
officer pilot on active duty or in the ARC on EAD, holding the longest original rating date with
at least one year of retainability as of 15 June, not recalled and without a break in service, will
be designated the Gray Eagle. A “break in service” is a period of more than 12 months when the
pilot transferred from active duty to the ARC or from the ARC to active duty. If two or more
pilots have the same original rating date, the senior officer (based upon date of rank in current
grade) will be designated the Gray Eagle.

                         AIRFIELD OPERATIONS (AO) AWARDS

3.1. Introduction: This chapter provides procedural guidance for the USAF AO Awards
Program; explains the Lt General Gordon A. Blake Aircraft Save Award and Aircraft Assist
Award eligibility, and procedures for submissions; and describes the annual Airfield
Management (AM) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) awards and nomination procedures. It
specifies procedures to recognize personnel who have made notable contributions to the AM or
ATC fields. It provides for USAF participation in the Air Traffic Control Association (ATCA)
awards competition. These awards apply to all Air Force activities that provide AO services.
Award of the Air Force Recognition Ribbon is authorized to named individuals selected as
recipients of functional USAF-level special trophies and awards managed by the career field
teams.
3.2. Lt General Gordon A. Blake Aircraft Save Award and Aircraft Assist Award
   3.2.1. Award Criteria: Aircraft “Save” Award is for any action taken by ATC or AM
   personnel that result in the safe recovery of an imperiled airborne aircraft or help given to an

   to personnel using the “Save” criteria, except that the performance does not have to extend
   beyond normal duty requirements.
   3.2.2. Award Eligibility: All USAF AO personnel are eligible. Any other military or
   civilian performing ATC or AM duties in a USAF-operated or augmented facility, or in an
   ANG-unit facility, are also eligible. Recognition under this program does not make
   individuals ineligible for other awards under AFI 36-2803, The Air Force Awards and
   Decorations Program.

             FIELD OF AERONAUTICS AND ASTRONAUTICS AWARDS

7.1. Introduction. This chapter provides guidance and procedures for the annual selection
process of the Field of Aeronautics and Astronautics (FOAA) Awards. The FOAA Awards are
considered to be among the most prestigious awards nationally in the field of aviation and are
sponsored by private organizations, such as the National Aeronautic Association (NAA), having
close ties to the Air Force. The FOAA Awards consist of the Aviator Valor Award, Cheney
Award, Mackay Trophy and the Gen Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy.
7.2. Background and Description of the Awards.
   7.2.1. Aviator Valor Award. The award is presented to a rated Air Force officer for a
   “conspicuous act of valor or courage performed during aerial flight during either combat or
   noncombat.” The act must have occurred during the current calendar year. Posthumous
   awards are not permitted. The award is sponsored by American Legion’s Aviator Post #743,
   New York, NY, and consists of a medal, ribbon, and certificate. The Chief of Staff, US Air
   Force, selects the recipient, subject to concurrence by the Aviator Post #743. The Aviator
   Post presents the award at their annual banquet in May in Fort Hamilton, NY.
   7.2.2. Cheney Award. The award is given for an “act of valor, extreme fortitude, or self-
   sacrifice in a humanitarian interest, performed in connection with aircraft, but not necessarily
   of a military nature by an Air Force officer or enlisted member.” Limit joint nominations to
   two individuals. The act must have occurred during the current calendar year. Posthumous
   awards are accepted. Mrs. Mary Schofield and Mrs. Ruth Cheney Streeter, mother and sister
   of the late First Lieutenant William H. Cheney, established the award in 1927 to honor the
   memory of Lieutenant Cheney, who was killed in an air collision at Foggia, Italy, on 20
   January 1918. Riggs National Bank was acquired by PNC Bank in 2005 who now
   administers the Cheney Award Trust. Award elements consist of a certificate, bronze plaque,
   and an honorarium. The CSAF selects the recipient, and, subject to concurrence by the donor,
   presents the award.
   7.2.3. Mackay Trophy. The trophy is presented for “the most meritorious flight of the year”
   performed by an Air Force military member or an aircrew. First consideration is given to an
   individual member. The award may also be given for “gallantry, intrepidity, unusual
   initiative, resourcefulness, and achievement of outstanding results with unusual presence of
   mind under combat or noncombat conditions.” Mr. Clarence H. Mackay, who was the head
   of the Postal and Telegraph Commercial Cable Companies at the time, established the award
   in 1912. The National Aeronautical Association (NAA) sponsors the award. The trophy,
   which consists of a large silver cup on a mahogany base, remains in the custody of the
   National Air and Space museum, Smithsonian Institution. Award elements consist of a
   plaque, certificate and engraved presentation folder. The CSAF makes the selection and
   presentation.
   7.2.4. General Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy. The trophy is awarded for “the most
   outstanding contribution to the nation’s progress in aerospace” during the current calendar
   year. An active duty Air Force military member or a Department of the Air Force civilian
   employee, with first consideration being given to an active duty Air Force military member,
AFI36-2807 7 AUGUST 2014                                                                      31


   is eligible. Do not submit units, retired individuals, “joint,” or posthumous nominations. The
   late Dr. Thomas W. McKnew, National Geographic Society, established the trophy in 1961to
   encourage and inspire further conquests of space after the example set by General White.
   The trophy depicts a bronze male figure, hurling a Saturn rocket into space with his right
   hand and holding a re-entry vehicle similar to the Dyna-Soar in his left hand. The figure is
   framed in a complex of golden orbits representing those of the earth, moon and a man-made
   space vehicle. It rests on a cube of Swedish Bonacord black granite. The trophy is on
   permanent display at the Smithsonian Institution. The Air Force Association sponsors the
   award. Each recipient receives a small bronze plaque and citation. The CSAF selects the
   recipient and the Air Force Association makes the presentation.

   29.10.3. Panel membership shall be cross-functional in nature. Air Force military members
   and civilian employees assigned to perform LVC/M&S activities at any level of command
 104                                                             AFI36-2807 7 AUGUST 2014


   may serve as members but shall be senior in rank to those nominated. They must also be
   available to devote the time required to evaluate and score the nomination packages during
   the time frames established by the delegated authority and the board president.
   29.10.4. Each panel shall consist of at least three voting members who will work
   independent of each other while evaluating and scoring nominees.
   29.10.5. The senior ranking member on the panel will be the panel president. Panel
   presidents will score the nominations as well as certify the panel members’ scores and the
   outcome of the competition.
   29.10.6. The panel president will first adjudicate the need for any discussions and rescoring
   actions in the event of major splits between panel members’ scores. Rescoring may take
   place, but only when it's clearly evident that it will change the outcome (winner) of the
   competition—it must be in the best interest of and fair to all nominees concerned. The final
   decision for panel members to discuss or rescore any nominees will rest with the panel
   president.
   29.10.7. Panel members cannot disclose the outcome of the panel to anyone prior to
   approval and formal announcement of the winners. Nor can panel members disclose or share
   with others how their command nominees ranked against other unit nominees in the scoring
   process. Panel members are required to destroy all documentation relating to the panel after
   the chairperson has approved the results and formally announced the winners.
   29.10.8. Panel members may also consider and weight bullets that address collaboration
   (both inside and outside one’s functional area); innovation; effective change management
   (account for the human element in developing solutions); documentation and communication
   (persuade and inform other stakeholders); and implementation and follow-through (ensure
   solutions are properly captured in policy, processes, training, and metrics).
29.11. No Winners in Category. If at the discretion of the evaluation board and the AF A3/5,
no nomination is deemed worthy of an award in a category, no award will be given in that
category for the year.
29.12. Presenting Awards: AF/A3/5 will announce award recipients by email message.
AFAMS will determine the most appropriate method to present and distribute the award and
mementos each year.
29.13. Air Force Recognition Ribbon/Pin. Members selected for individual awards or cited as
part of a team award are authorized to wear the Air Force Recognition Ribbon (military member)
or the Air Force Recognition Lapel Pin (civilian) in accordance with AFI 36-2805, Special
Trophies and Awards. AFAMS will provide award winners appropriate documentation for
updating their records through their appropriate personnel office. Contractors named part of a
team are not eligible to wear the recognition pin, but unit commanders are encouraged to forward
a memorandum to the contractor’s company for their appropriate recognition programs.
29.14. National Training and Simulation Association (NTSA) award nominees. AFAMS, as
the delegated authority will work through the winning unit commanders (or equivalents) and
with supervisors of individuals or teams for submission to the NTSA award program. Winners at
the national level are normally recognized during the Inter-service/Industry Training, Simulation
and Education Conference (I/ITSEC).
