1.1. Reference : Eglin Air Force Base Plan 10-221, Installation Control Center Operations.
1.2. Purpose This instruction provides guidance for the 46 TW in implementing/alerting recall
procedures and responding to emergency situations.

1.3. Procedures The 46TW Commander, or his designated representative, may direct
implementation of the procedures in this instruction, in whole or part, as conditions dictate. The
commander will activate the 46 TW Unit Control Center (UCC) by calling the Range Operations
Control Center (ROCC), who will then initiate the Pyramid Alert System for the 46 TW as
required. All units within the 46 TW with UCCs will activate their UCC when notified by the
ROCC. All units will maintain a current copy of their Recall Roster IAW Plan 10-221 and
provide an electronic copy to the ROCC located in building 380, room 108C, at least monthly or
when updated.
       1.3.1. All squadrons with UCCs will report their applicable strengths and attainments to
       their group control centers. Group control centers: 46 OG, 46 MXG, 46 XP, 46 SK, and
       46 RANG will report their strengths and attainments to the ROCC. The 46 th Test Group
       (46 TG) at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, is not carried on the Hurricane/Recall listing.
1.4. Activation Activation of the Eglin AFB Pyramid Alert System will be initiated by the
AAC Commander or designated representative. When the situation warrants, he will authorize
the Eglin Command Post (ECP) to begin recall, or a subset, of all Eglin AFB personnel, or
initiate a pyramid alert notification to pass a message to all Eglin AFB personnel.
       1.4.1. Personnel Strength Report. All groups within the 46 TW, including the staff, will
       establish pyramid notification procedures, which are responsive to the recall/notification
       procedures outlined in Annex E of EAFB Plan 10-221. All groups will develop internal
       notification procedures and checklists for relaying information received. The goal is for
       all 46 TW organizations to attain 70% personnel accounted for at X+1:30 hours and 95%
       at X+3:30 hours. To satisfactorily accomplish the recall, the wing strength reports are to
       be submitted to Installation Control Center (ICC) on the Eglin Emergency Intranet
       (ENET) (https://enet.eglin.af.mil) by the ROCC.
       1.4.2. The Contingency Operations Center (COC) may be activated by the 46 TW
       Commander following any AAC recall by calling the ROCC. The COC will remain
       activated until released by the 46 TW/CC. An initial status briefing will be presented in
       the COC approximately 90 minutes after activation of the recall based upon the actual
       recall start time included in the recall message. All COC members listed below will
       report to their duty station to check in and then report to the COC for duty.
