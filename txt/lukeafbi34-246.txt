        suites controlled by Protocol are assigned after hours and prior to assigning personnel to
        the Maricopa or Glendale house.
     2.2. The 56 FW Chief of Protocol will:
        2.2.1. Ensure Protocol representatives brief inbound DVs on lodging policies i.e., check-

      3.1.1. Space Available Reservations can be confirmed up to 120 days in advance of their
      arrival date, space permitting, based on actual and projected occupancy. AFI 34-246

      option to extend these windows if the opportunity exists based on seasonal occupancy.

      exception.

      term TDY guests (more than 7 days) will not be placed in business suites controlled by
      the protocol office without first contacting a protocol representative. Space Available
      guests placed in rooms controlled by protocol will be accommodated for up to a 3-night
      stay and extensions will be referred to protocol for approval. Lodging personnel will

      extensions on weekends and holidays.

   to lodging. Protocol will also determine what guests are to be pre-registered. A Protocol
   representative will visit the lodging front desk to obtain keys and have the guest service
   representative check the guest into the computer. They will also ensure pre-registered guests
   are briefed concerning use of the facilities and express check out payment procedures.

   are blocked the night before.
   4.2. Protocol will promptly notify lodging of no shows for pre-registered guests.
