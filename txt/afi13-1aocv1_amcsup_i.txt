                                 POLICY AND CONCEPTS

1.1. Introduction
   1.1.1. This AFI provides guidance for geographic, functional, and ARC aligned AOC
   training programs. Guidance for geographic AOCs is applicable to Rapid Augmentation
   Team (RAT) as established by AF Program Action Directive (PAD) 10-2, Direction to
   Restructure Command and Control of Component Numbered Air Forces.
      1.1.1.1. Chapter 1 lists general training guidance applicable to all AOCs. Specific AOC
      and ARC aligned AOC units training program requirements are explained in Chapter 2.
      Due to the nature of their organizational structure and differing processes, functional
      AOC training program requirements will be addressed in functional MAJCOM/unit
      supplements.
      1.1.1.2. ARC unit CCs will ensure their annual training plans include training to
      maintain worldwide deploy ability.
      1.1.1.3. (Added-AMC) This supplement provides training program guidance for all
      assigned personnel in the 618 AOC (TACC); effected personnel include all Active, Air
      Reserve Component (ARC), and AF Civilians. Contractor training is accomplished IAW
      the applicable Performance Work Statement (PWS). It establishes the training policy,
      management criteria, and administrative practices required for personnel to achieve and
      maintain Combat Mission Ready (CMR) status.
   1.1.2. This AFI outlines AOC training concept, structure and responsibilities.
   1.1.2. (AMC) 618 AOC Training Program. This Supplement outlines the 618 AOC (TACC)
   training concept, structure and responsibilities.
      1.1.2.1. (Added-AMC) Unit level guidance, maintained by the Unit Training Manager
      (UTM) and AMC/A3CG, includes the 618 AOC (TACC) Annual Training Plan, and
      Directorate Master Training Plans (MTPs). The MTPs are attachments to the ATP.
      Additional documents maintained in the Training Program Office will include the Master
      Task List (MTL), current Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP), or Air
      Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS) locally developed AF IMT 797s, Job
      Qualification Standard Continuation (if applicable), milestones for tasks and Career
      Development Course (CDC) completion. Refer to AFI 36-2201 (Attachment 13) for
      military training plan requirements and AFI 36-401, Employee Training and
      Development, for civilian training plan requirements.
      1.1.2.2. (Added-AMC) The Annual Training Plan is developed IAW the sample on the
      AOC community of practice (CoP) page. Minimum requirements for a directorate MTP
      will include those mandated by AFI 36-2201 (Attachment 13). The UTM will provide
      additional requirements for directorate-specific MTPs and ensure that a standard template
      is used for all directorates. The combination of ATP and MTPs meets the combination of
      AOC training guidance, and AF Unit Training guidance.

    1.1.3. This AFI applies to AOC crewmembers to include specialty teams and also establishes
    required orientation training for liaison/augmentation personnel.
    1.1.3. (AMC) This Supplement applies to all AOC crewmembers (the term ‘crewmember’
    refers to all personnel assigned to the TACC) to include specialty teams and also establishes
    required orientation training for liaison/augmentation personnel.
       1.1.3.1. AOC crewmembers, to include specialty teams, fill operational mission essential
       positions in the AOC. These positions are listed in AFI 13-1AOCV3, AOC Organization
       and Operational Procedures. AOC crewmembers may be military, civilian, or contractor
       personnel and are permanently assigned to active duty or ARC AOC units. Additionally,
       due to AOC manning constraints and unique theater or functional requirements, AOC
       units may require locally developed crewmember positions supporting a combatant
       commander that are not identified in AFI 13-1AOCV3. Unique positions and training
       associated with these positions will be identified in a unit supplement to this AFI.
       1.1.3.2. Liaison/augmentation personnel may represent other weapon systems,
       components, commands, government agencies, or coalition partners.              They are
       administratively subordinate to their parent organizations while working within the AOC
       and will receive orientation training from the host AOC. Orientation training specifics
       are outlined in paragraph 2.3 of this AFI.
       1.1.3.3. Augmentees on temporary assignment to a host AOC Commander (AOC/CC)
       must receive locally developed orientation training by the host AOC.
           1.1.3.3.1. (Added-AMC) All other groups or organizations with personnel assigned
           to the 618 AOC, but not directly subordinate to the Commander, are responsible for
           ensuring their personnel are trained in applicable 618 AOC processes.
       1.1.3.4. (Added-AMC) The 618 AOC organization is IAW standard MAJCOM HQ
       hierarchy; Commander, Directors, Division Chiefs, Branch Chiefs, Section Chiefs, and
       Commander’s Staff. Within each section are the various specialized positions (see table
       1.1). AOC members may be military, civilian, or contractor personnel and are
       permanently assigned to the TACC, or assigned to ARC units but supporting the TACC
       on temporary orders. Contractor’s training is IAW the PWS. Training requirements vary
       by position and are identified in the Annual Training Plan (ATP) and the Directorate
       Master Training Plans (MTPs).
       1.1.3.5. (Added-AMC) The 618 AOC members include foreign coalition partners that
       receive the Global Mobility Air Operations Course (which provides Orientation Training
       as defined in this AFI). Those coalition members that actively participate in mission
       planning and execution receive the full AOC member Initial Qualification Training (IQT)
       and Mission Qualification Training (MQT) for Combat Mission Ready (CMR) status.
       1.1.3.6. (Added-AMC) All ARC personnel augmenting the 618 AOC receive the full
       AOC crewmember training (IQT and MQT) for CMR status. ARC personnel supporting
       618 AOC on orders longer than 90 days will adhere to active duty training requirements
       timelines. Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs) assigned to 618 AOC who are not
       on long-term orders will coordinate with their supervisor and Directorate Training
       Monitor (DTM) to establish a training timeline. This timeline will ensure IQT is
       completed NLT 9 months after in-processing and MQT is completed NLT 18 months
AFI13-1AOCV1_AMCSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                            7


      after in-processing. IMAs will coordinate with the DTM and Directorate Reserve
      Coordinator (DRC) for appropriate orders.

  1.1.4. This AFI directs formal appointment of AOC trainers with a unit developed trainer
  training program. Guidance on AOC trainer training can be found in paragraph 2.4 of this
  AFI. Note: AOC crewmember training, as outlined in this AFI, is a separate program from
  Air Force On-the-Job Training (OJT). OJT is governed by AFI 36-2201 Vol 3, Air Force
  Training Program On-the-Job Training Administration, and documented on the AF Form
 8                                          AFI13-1AOCV1_AMCSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2013


     623, On-the-Job Training Record or other AF approved system (for enlisted members only).
     There is a potential overlap of training requirements and events. Even so, AOC training and
     career field training documentation are separate programs.
        1.1.4.1. (Added-AMC) The 618 AOC Commander appoints in writing a primary and
        alternate Unit Training Manager (UTM). Each Director appoints in writing a primary and
        alternate Directorate Training Monitor (DTM). Note: On-the-Job Training (OJT) is
        documented IAW the Directorate MTP. Due to the extensive variety of AFSC’s, training
        specific to the 618 AOC will be documented using approved electronic or paper-based
        training records (addressed in Directorate MTPs).
1.2. General
     1.2.1. AOC training: There are two overarching categories of AOC training, crewmember
     and orientation training. AOC crewmember training consists of Initial Qualification Training
     (IQT) and Mission Qualification Training (MQT) for all AOC crewmembers qualifying to
     Combat Mission Ready (CMR). Upon receipt of CMR designation, all AOC CMR
     crewmembers will then complete Continuation Training (CT) requirements IAW paragraph
     2.2.3. Additionally, each unit will conduct orientation training as outlined in paragraph 2.3
     of this AFI for augmentees and liaison personnel.
        1.2.1.1. (Added-AMC) Some positions in the TACC only require Basic Qualification,
        such as administrative support positions. Most TACC crewmembers are required to
        accomplish Continuation Training (CT); these requirements are defined in the Directorate
        MTPs. In the 618 AOC training program, Orientation Training is an integral part of IQT.
     1.2.2. All training will be documented (See paragraph 2.5 of this AFI). Units will document
     IQT and MQT in the AOC learning management system (LMS) utilizing electronic AF Form
     4141, Individuals’ Record of Duties and Experience, Ground Environment Personnel.
     Functional communities such as Intelligence, Cyber, and Information Operations, may use
     command directed LMS systems to track IQT, MQT, and CT as long as the system provides
     equivalent information and is accessible to AOC training management personnel.
     Continuation training (CT) will be documented on locally developed tracking systems, other
     (Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) compliant) electronic storage means,
     or LMS AF Form 4142, Individual Annual Training Record, when developed. Units may
     maintain manual training folders as backups only. Units will maintain IQT/MQT training
     documentation on personnel until PCS and forward to next unit if at an AOC. Following
     award of CMR status, IQT/MQT training documentation and certificates may be maintained
     in unit developed grade books, or maintained in unit developed training folders. Award of
     CMR will be documented IAW AFI 13-1AOC, Volume 2, AOC Standards and Evaluation.
     Additionally, this CMR will be annotated by training personnel on AF Form 4141.
        1.2.2.1. (Added-AMC) All training will be documented IAW ATP and MTPs. See also
        para. 2.5.4.
     1.2.3. All AOCs and affiliated units will have an annual training plan (ATP). An example
     can be found on the AOC community of practice (CoP) page (see attachment 2, Glossary of
     Links for the CoP address).
        1.2.3.1. (Added-AMC) The 618 AOC publishes a MTP for each respective Directorate,
        reviewed and approved annually by the Directors.

                                           Chapter 2

                                AOC TRAINING PROGRAM

2.1. Introduction: This chapter provides AOC training requirements with program details for
Geographic AOCs and their ARC aligned units. Functional AOCs will abide by this chapter
unless otherwise identified in their Unit/MAJCOM supplement, which will take precedence, and
no waiver is required.
   2.1.1. Crewmember training is a sequential, three-phased program to reach and maintain
   CMR status. Phases are: IQT, MQT, and CT.
   2.1.1. (AMC) Crewmember training is a sequential, three-phased program to reach and
   maintain CMR status. Phases are: IQT, MQT, and CT (as required). See also Attachment 2
   for a sample of the 3-phased training cycle. For members that transfer positions within the
   AOC, a Difference Training Course is provided, tailored to the individual needs of the
   students.
       2.1.1.1. (Added-AMC) Flight Manager (FM) training includes FAA Aircraft Dispatcher
       training and certification and a similar but separate CMR training program. FMs will
       comply with AFI11-255, Volume 1, Integrated Flight Management Training, AFI11-255,
       Volume 2, Flight Manager Standardization/Evaluation Program, and AFI 11-255,
       Volume 3, Flight Manager Responsibilities and Procedures. FM training is documented
       in Training Business Area (TBA), located on the AF Portal. For Flight Managers, the
       mission qualification training requirements of the AFI11-255 series take precedence over
       this Supplement.
   2.1.2. Orientation training contains portions of the sequential three-phased crewmember
   training program tailored to the crewmember’s individual experience. Orientation training
   may result in awarding of CMR Status and awarding of a SEI upon training completion.
   2.1.2. (AMC) Orientation training is informal and occurs throughout the three-phased
   training program, tailored to the member’s individual experience. Presently, AMC does not
   award a Special Experience Identifier (SEI) for AOC experience.
2.2. Crewmember Training Program
2.2. (AMC)618 AOC Crewmember Training Program
   2.2.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT):
       2.2.1.1. IQT provides the training necessary to qualify AOC crew-members in a generic
       division/team level position without regard to a specific AOC’s mission. Upon
       completion of IQT, crewmembers attain BQ status and are awarded the appropriate AOC
       SEI. BQ is the qualification status of an AOC crew member who has satisfactorily
       completed IQT and is qualified to perform AOC divisional/team duties. The member
       must meet the minimum academic and performance standards set forth by the AOC
       weapons system FTU. BQ is not a long-term status nor does it imply position specific
       expertise; individuals are required to continue training progressing to MQT to improve
       and attain proficiency on positional duties and tasks related to their unit’s mission.
AFI13-1AOCV1_AMCSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                      21


     2.2.1.1. (AMC) IQT provides the training necessary to qualify members in a generic
     Directorate/ Division/ Branch/ Section level position without regard to a specific AOC’s
     mission. The member must meet the minimum academic and performance standards set
     forth by the FTU. IQT courses at the FTU are; Global Mobility Air Operations Core
     (GMAOC), Global Mobility Air Operations Familiarization (GMAOF), or the Global
     Mobility Air Operations Executive (GMAOE), and tailorable Global Mobility Air
     Operations Track (GMAOT) training courses. The member’s assigned position will
     determine which of the courses will be required. Upon completion of IQT, members
     become ‘Basic Qualified’ (BQ). BQ status allows the crewmember to enter MQT.
        2.2.1.1.1. AOCs must request a waiver from their MAJCOM OPR for each
        individual unable to attend FTU. Personnel waived from FTU attendance must
        complete In-Unit IQT (IUIQT). IUIQT will be accomplished using the FTU course
        syllabus and materials to the maximum extent possible within unit resources.
            2.2.1.1.1.1. (Added-AMC) The 618 AOC must request a waiver from
            AMC/A3CG for each individual unable to attend FTU. If a new person’s arrival
            doesn’t allow them to attend IQT first, an individual may start MQT prior to IQT.
            However, personnel will not perform their new duties and responsibilities
            unsupervised until they are CMR. In exceptional cases, a member may be unable
            to attend GMAO for an extended period of time (no GMAO courses scheduled,
            operational requirements, etc.) while still completing all other MQT requirements.
            In these cases, the Director may provisionally certify the member to perform his
            duties unsupervised as long as all other MQT requirements have been met. Every
            effort will be made to enroll the member in the first applicable GMAO course
            (and Track if required) available.
        2.2.1.1.2. Not all AOC duty positions are accommodated by FTU in-residence
        courses (List located on AOC CoP - See Attachment 2). For those that are standard
        but not taught at the FTU, ACC/A3C or MAJCOM OPR is responsible for
        development of a MAJCOM approved IQT program. For those non-AFI 13-1AOC,
        volume 3 crew positions unique to their AOC/CCDR, IQT development is a unit
        responsibility. For AMD positions not accommodated by the FTU a list is posted on
        the AMD Training CoP, see Attachment 2.
            2.2.1.1.2.1. (Added-AMC) All 618 AOC duty positions require Formal Training
            Unit (FTU) in-residence courses.
        2.2.1.1.3. Attending IQT enroute to the AOC permanent change of station (PCS)
        location is the preferred method IAW this AFI. AOC TMs must ensure this occurs to
        the maximum extent possible. If IQT enroute to PCS is not an option, contact the
        gaining unit MAJCOM POC who will then coordinate with ACC/A3CT.
            2.2.1.1.3.1. (Added-AMC) 618 AOC members normally do not attend IQT
            courses until arriving on station. Temporary duty, leave, appointments, or
            extended absence will not normally be allowed during attendance in any classes
            offered at the MOS Det 2 (Scott AFB, IL). Requests for emergency leave will be
            coordinated with the individual’s commander and approved by the MOS Det 2
            Commander.

     2.2.1.2. Purpose: IQT provides foundational knowledge, skills, and context for follow-on
     training. IQT provides basic skills to all AOC crewmembers in order for them to work in
     an AOC, but does not provide theater specifics. Crewmember theater duty requirements
     will be acquired through unit MQT program.
     2.2.1.3. Method: IQT will consist of students taking the advanced distributed learning
     (ADL) lessons in LMS and an FTU course. AOC crewmembers will attend the FTU in-
     residence unless otherwise noted on AOC CoP or approved MAJCOM supplement for
     functional AOCs. Members learning a secondary AOC duty position will be allowed to
     return to the FTU with MAJCOM OPR and ACC/A3CT coordination and approval.
     2.2.1.3. (AMC) Method: IQT will consist of an FTU course. AOC members will attend
     the FTU in-residence. Members training in a secondary duty position will be allowed to
     return to the FTU with Director coordination and approval.
        2.2.1.3.1. There are only four courses currently approved as “in-lieu–of” courses for
        prescribed FTU courses: The USAF Weapons School Space Superiority course at
        Nellis AFB, NV for AOC space personnel; the Advanced Study of Air Mobility
        (ASAM) course at the USAF Air Expeditionary Center at McGuire AFB, NJ; the
        SAASS at Maxwell AFB, AL for Strategy Division personnel; and the C/JSSC
        Course at Hurlburt Field, FL, for Division Chiefs. These courses include AOC and
        AOC process training which are applicable to the positions these crewmembers
        normally work. These and any new “in–lieu-of” courses may be found on the AOC
        CoP.
            2.2.1.3.1.1. (Added-AMC) There are no courses currently approved as ‘in-lieu-
            of’ courses for 618 AOC prescribed FTU courses.
        2.2.1.3.2. AOC crewmember positions are mapped to FTU and “in-lieu–of” courses
        on the AOC CoP.
            2.2.1.3.2.1. (Added-AMC) 618 AOC positions are mapped to the MOS Det 2
            FTU and are identified in the MTP.
     2.2.1.4. Timeline: Crewmembers attending FTU will complete IQT upon graduation.
     IUIQT will be completed within 120 days from start date for active duty personnel and
     18 months for ARC personnel. IUIQT must be started no later than 30 days (180 days for
     ARC personnel) following date arrived station (DAS). If necessary for mission
     accomplishment, IUIQT may be completed prior to FTU attendance, but IQT SEI should
     not be awarded until crewmember attends FTU.
     2.2.1.4. (AMC) Timeline: Students will start IQT with the FTU course within 90 days
     of arriving station. Graduation from FTU completes IQT. When FTU courses for IQT are
     not available within 90 days, a provisional certification may be awarded until member
     attends FTU. A provisional certification allows members to conduct assigned duties
     without direct supervision. This does not preclude the requirement to complete FTU
     training in order to be certified.
     2.2.1.5. Exceptions: Exceptions to the IQT timeline may occur via extension or
     incomplete result in training. Note: IQT is a onetime event and an individual returning to
     an AOC assignment after having previously accomplished IQT need not re-accomplish
AFI13-1AOCV1_AMCSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                      23


     this phase. They must still complete appropriate training outlined by unit training
     manager following records review. This is not a waiver and the original IQT completion
     date remains in effect. Qualification in a new AOC position may require a different IQT
     or FTU class, in which case IQT may be reaccomplished for the new position.
     Attendance in new FTU class will require AOC TM request, MAJCOM POC and
     ACC/A3CT approval.
        2.2.1.5.1. Extension: AOC/CCs may grant a single 30-day extension (ARC aligned
        unit commanders may grant 180 days) for completion of IQT. Following the
        AOC/CC extension, the CC, upon review of the individual’s training to date, may
        request an additional extension from MAJCOM OPR of 30 days. If after the
        AOC/CC and/or MAJCOM OPR extensions, training is still not complete, the
        commander has two options: either reenter the individual into training (restart the
        clock) or drop the individual from AOC training permanently. Both options are
        mandatory reporting items to the MAJCOM OPR and ACC/A3CT.
        2.2.1.5.1. (AMC) For TACC, exceptions to the IQT timeline may occur via
        extension or incomplete result in training. Note: IQT is a one-time event. Individuals
        returning to the TACC within four years of departure need not reaccomplish IQT.
        However, they must still complete appropriate training outlined by the DTM
        following a records review. This is not a waiver and unless repeated, the original IQT
        completion date remains in effect. Qualification in a new AOC position may require a
        different IQT or FTU class, in which case IQT may be re-accomplished for the new
        position. Attendance in a new FTU class will require DTM request and Director
        approval. Directors are authorized to grant an individual one 30-day training
        extension per phase for IQT/MQT. The 618 AOC/CC may grant a second 30-day
        extension.
        2.2.1.5.2. Incomplete: Students unable to finish an FTU course for other than
        performance issues (e.g., medical reasons, etc.) may be reentered into a subsequent
        class with 505 TRS/CC recommendation, unit CC, and ACC/A3CT concurrence.
        2.2.1.5.3. Failure: FTU IQT failure is a mandatory reporting item by the 505 TRS to
        the reporting unit, the MAJCOM OPR, and ACC/A3CT. The following gaining unit
        commander options are available for IQT failure:
        2.2.1.5.3. (AMC) Failure: The FTU Course Director will report any individual
        failing to complete training to the Expeditionary Center (EC), 618 AOC UTM, in turn
        will notify the AMC/A3C for coord with the associated Functional Manager.
            2.2.1.5.3.1. Due to extenuating circumstances, return individual to the FTU with
            505 TRS/CC recommendations; gaining unit CC, MAJCOM OPR, and
            ACC/A3CT approval.
            2.2.1.5.3.1. (AMC) Under extenuating circumstances the Director may return
            individual to the FTU with 618 AOC/CC approval.
            2.2.1.5.3.2. End training and place individual in a unit non AOC crewmember
            position. Note: A student who failed an FTU IQT course may not be
            subsequently enrolled in IUIQT.

            2.2.1.5.3.2. (AMC) The Commander may elect to initiate a reassignment action.
         2.2.1.5.4. (Added-AMC) Training waivers may be granted for personnel with prior
         618 AOC experience on a case-by-case basis. Waiver authority for the GMAOC,
         GMAOE, GMOAF, and GMAOT courses is the appropriate Director through the 618
         AOC UTM.
  2.2.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT)
     2.2.2.1. Definition: MQT provides the training necessary to qualify or requalify AOC
     crewmembers in a specific position to perform the missions assigned to a specific AOC.
     MQT is a unit responsibility. AOC crewmembers maintain BQ status until they complete
     MQT. Completion of MQT is a prerequisite for attaining CMR status.
     2.2.2.2. Purpose: The purpose of MQT is to prepare a crewmember for attainment of
     CMR status in a specific AOC duty position.
     2.2.2.3. Method: MQT normally involves tailored training with a trainer plus applicable
     subject matter experts (SMEs), classroom academics, self-study, and practice as
     necessary. Each AOC will determine the best mix of methods to meet all MQT training
     needs. ACC/A3C and parent MAJCOMs will manage the development and use of MQT
     course materials and TTLs. TTLs for AFI 13-1AOCV3 crewmember positions must be
     approved and standardized by HQ ACC/A3C in coordination with appropriate theater or
     functional MAJCOM. WS standardized MQT Training 797s; program of instruction,
     etc., along with execution guidance will be posted to the AOC CoP and considered an
     extension of this AFI as minimum guidance.
         2.2.2.3.1. (Added-AMC) For TACC: MQT normally involves tailored training. The
         Director will determine the best mix of methods to meet all MQT training needs.
         AMC/A3C will manage the development and use of MQT course materials and
         Training Task Lists (TTLs). TTLs for AFI 13-1AOC, V3 AMC Sup positions must be
         approved and standardized by AMC/A3C. Weapons System (WS) standardized MQT
         Training 797s; program of instruction, etc., along with execution guidance will be
         posted to the AMC/A3C SharePoint site and considered an extension of this AFI as
         minimum guidance.
     2.2.2.4. Timeline: MQT must be started NLT 45 days from IQT completion (90 days for
     ARC personnel). First term airmen will complete the first term airmen course then have
     30 days for entry into MQT. In all cases, MQT must be complete within 90 days of start
     (ARC personnel have 365 days to complete) of MQT.
     2.2.2.5. MQT is complete when all training requirements are complete and the individual
     is released to unit Stan/Eval. A crewmember will achieve CMR status when Stan/Eval
     has completed its evaluation process and the AOC/CC or designate (not lower than AOC
     Division Chief level) signs the appropriate paperwork.
     2.2.2.5. (AMC) MQT is complete when all training requirements are completed. A
     member achieves CMR status when certified by the Deputy Director (or higher).
     2.2.2.6. Portions may be accomplished before formal entry into MQT; however, MQT
     may not be completed out of sequence (i.e., prior to IQT complete).
     2.2.2.7. MQT may not be waived.
AFI13-1AOCV1_AMCSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                       25


      2.2.2.8. Extensions: Extensions to the MQT timeline may occur as follows: The
      Commander may approve one 30-day extension (180 days for ARC units). Following a
      unit CC extension, the MAJCOM OPR may grant an additional 30 day (ARC 180 days)
      extension.
      2.2.2.9. Incomplete/failure to progress: If training is not complete after Unit/CC and
      MAJCOM OPR extensions, the CC must remove the individual from training and assign
      to a non-AOC crewmember position.
      2.2.2.9. (AMC) Incomplete/failure to progress: If training is not complete after Director
      and Commander extensions, the individual must be removed from training and assign to a
      non-qualifying position.
          2.2.2.9.1. (Added-AMC) The Commander may elect to initiate a reassignment
          action.
      2.2.2.10. Upon CMR certification it is incumbent on the AOC TM to ensure appropriate
      SEI code has been changed from the generic non-CMR SEI to the applicable AOC CMR
      SEI.
      2.2.2.10. (AMC) Not Applicable
   2.2.3. Continuation Training (CT)
      2.2.3.1. Definition: CT provides crewmembers with the volume, frequency, and mix of
      training necessary to maintain CMR proficiency in their assigned position. CT begins
      after a crewmember has attained CMR status. Units are responsible for developing an
      annual CT plan focusing on the units’ mission or support for any upcoming major
      exercises. These plans will be approved by AOC/CC and submitted to appropriate
      MAJCOM for review and additional guidance. Note: Mandatory AF training generally
      referred to as ancillary training may not be counted toward CT.       ARC units will
      accomplish standardized academic CT (IAW Attachment 3) over a two-year vice one-
      year period. Thus, quarterly requirements become semi-annual; semi-annual become
      annual requirements, and annual requirements become bi-annual for ARC aligned units.
      2.2.3.1. (AMC) CT provides TACC crewmembers with the volume, frequency, and mix
      of training necessary to maintain CMR proficiency in their assigned position. CT begins
      after a member has attained CMR status. Directorates that have CT are responsible for
      developing a periodic CT plan focusing on the AOC mission. These plans will be
      approved by the Director and submitted to AMC/A3CG via the UTM for review and
      additional guidance.

     Note: The above table is not all inclusive but does contain most exercises AOC units
     participate in. Any question on exercise classification should be directed to MAJCOM
     OPR or ACC/A3CT.
        2.2.3.2. Content: AOCs have common CT requirements levied by MAJCOM OPR;
        however, each is expected to add unique CT requirements to their ATP. General CT
        requirement table is at Attachment 3. AOCs have general CT requirements in the
        following six primary and one AOC/CC categories.
        2.2.3.2. (AMC) CT for the 618 AOC (TACC) will include:
            2.2.3.2.1. Doctrine
            2.2.3.2.1. (AMC) Doctrine
            2.2.3.2.2. Joint force and AOC authoritative documents
            2.2.3.2.2. (AMC) Joint Force, and Mobility Air Forces (MAF) authoritative
            documents
            2.2.3.2.3. AOC systems
            2.2.3.2.3. (AMC) TACC integrated mission management
            2.2.3.2.4. Intelligence Preparation of the Operating Environment (IPOE)

        qualification (CMR status) and expanding operational level knowledge and C2 skills. CT
AFI13-1AOCV1_AMCSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                       27


     is the AOC/CC’s and Division Chiefs’ tool to ensure that AOC crewmembers are
     prepared to support CCDR, JFACC, and AADC as required at all times. Crewmembers
     qualified in more than one position must meet CT requirements for each position. Dual
     qualified crewmembers with like CT requirements that are the same for each position
     only need to perform the specific CT requirement for 1 position.
     2.2.3.3. (AMC) Purpose: CT accomplishes two purposes; maintaining positional
     qualification (CMR status) and expanding operational level knowledge and C2 skills. CT
     is the Commanders and Directors tool to ensure that members are prepared to support the
     Global Mobility mission as required at all times. Members qualified in more than one
     position (dual qualified) must meet CT requirements for each position. Dual qualified
     members with like CT requirements that are the same for each position only need to
     perform the specific CT requirement for one position.
     2.2.3.4. Method: CT may consist of any combination of mass academics, e-learning,
     directed self-study, systems training, positional refresher training, or exercises.
     2.2.3.4. (AMC) TACC crewmember CT training methods. Crewmembers will
     accomplish CT by participate in mass academics, e-learning, directed self-study, systems
     training, positional refresher training, or exercises. In addition, a one-time FTU seminar
     [Cross-Functional Integration Course (CFIC)] is directed for all crewmembers between 9
     and 12 months following their initial award of CMR. All CMR crewmembers will
     complete Directorate CT with a focus on those items listed in para. 2.2.3.2. (above).
     2.2.3.5. Timeline: CT requirements begin the first duty day of the following month after
     the individual is designated CMR. Requirement completion timeframes can be found in
     Attachment 3 and unit ATPs. CT requirements specific to functional AOCs will be
     addressed in their Unit/MAJCOM supplement. CT may be prorated but is normally not
     waived. Waivers will be evaluated on a case by case basis and approved by MAJCOM
     OPR. ARC units will accomplish CT training over a two-year vice one-year period.
        2.2.3.5.1. (Added-AMC) Timeline for TACC: CT requirements begin the first duty
        day after the individual is designated CMR. Requirement completion timeframes can
        be found in the MTP.
     2.2.3.6. Proration: Units may prorate CT requirements based on initial CMR date,
     TDYs, deployments, or periods of non-AOC duty (e.g., honor guard, medical leave).
     Unit must ensure training is adjusted to account for time assigned (PCS or TDY) to
     contingencies (See Figure 2.1.)
        2.2.3.6.1. (Added-AMC) Proration: The TACC may prorate CT requirements based
        on initial CMR date, TDYs, deployments, or periods of non-AOC duty (e.g., honor
        guard, medical leave). Directorates must ensure training is adjusted to account for
        time deferred by PCS, TDY, contingency support, etc. MQT and CT are separate
        activities, but while in Mission Qualification Training, Directorate driven CT activity
        may be accomplished to document specific skills.

                                                                       330

Note: CT periods are tied to calendar. Crewmember non-availability days need not be contiguous to prorate from
CT.

Examples:
(1) Capt Smith becomes CMR on Apr 20.
- Monthly CT for Oct thru Apr are waived;
- Quarterly CT for 1st, and 2nd quarters are waived,
- Semi-Annual CT for the 1st half is waived; For ARC 18 month training is waived.
(2) A1C Jones becomes CMR on Sep 21.
- Monthly CT would start on 1 Oct the beginning of the CT period for all.
- Annual CT is waived and New Year begins 1 Oct.

         2.2.3.7. Failure to meet CT requirements: Failure to meet CT requirements results in
         regression to non-CMR (N-CMR) status. AOC/CCs may allow up to a 30-day grace
         period for the accomplishment of CT requirements. ARC-aligned unit commanders may
         allow up to a 180-day grace period.
         2.2.3.7. (AMC) Failure to meet TACC CT requirements results in regression to non-
         CMR (N-CMR) status. The Director may allow up to a 30-day grace period for the
         accomplishment of CT requirements, or 180-day grace period for ARC personnel.
              2.2.3.7.1. N-CMR crewmembers may not perform AOC duties unless supervised by
              a CMR crewmember.
              2.2.3.7.2. To regain CMR status, a crewmember must accomplish the delinquent CT.
              The individual's training records must reflect both the regression to N-CMR and the
              reacquisition of CMR status.
              2.2.3.7.3. Failure to regain CMR within 6 months (18 months for ARC) results in
              regression to unqualified status (UQ).
              2.2.3.7.3. (AMC) Failure to regain TACC CMR within 6 months (18 months for
              ARC) results in regression to BQ status. If a member fails to complete CT
AFI13-1AOCV1_AMCSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                        29


          requirements that result in N-CMR status, the N-CMR member must, at a minimum,
          be observed/supervised by a qualified/MR member of the same duty position until CT
          requirements are accomplished. Document observed duties in the member’s training
          record. If the N-CMR member cannot reestablish MR status for the duty position, the
          commander will take appropriate action IAW AFI 36-2101. Extensions and waivers
          for training requirements are addressed in paragraphs 1.5. and 1.6. respectively.
2.3. Orientation Training
   2.3.1. All AOCs must provide orientation training for TDY AOC crewmembers, specialty
   team members, liaisons, and augmentees to aid their integration. This training will be
   tailored and based on expected duties, previous experience, and AOC knowledge. The
   gaining AOC is responsible to both develop content and present the training. Note: A CMR
   rating in any AFI 13-1AOCV3 position is transferrable among the Geographic AOCs in the
   same CMR duty position upon completion of unit theater familiarization training.
      2.3.1.1. (Added-AMC) The TACC provides orientation training for all members,
      permanent or TDY, regardless of support duration.
   2.3.2. Orientation training is a menu of training modules consisting of any combination of e-
   learning lessons, briefings, or directed self-study. This menu is designed by the AOC TM,
   tailored to the individual, and approved by AOC/CC or Division Chief if delegated by CC.
   2.3.2. (AMC) Orientation training is a series of training events consisting of any
   combination of e-learning lessons, briefings, guided tours, or directed self-study. This menu
   is designed by the DTM, tailored to the individual, and approved by the Director.
      2.3.2.1. Orientation training is appropriate for CMR AOC crewmembers temporarily
      assigned to another AOC. If the AOC crewmember performs duties in his or her CMR
      position, theater/mission familiarization should be all that is required.
          2.3.2.1.1. (Added-AMC) The TACC CMR rating is a MAF Functional rating only.
          The rating is applicable to crewmembers supporting the TACC, an AMC stage or
          other temporary MAF C2 operation requiring their specialty/skills. Temporary duty
          or reassignment to a geographic AOC will require the appropriate geographic AOC
          training.
          2.3.2.1.2. (Added-AMC) Orientation training is appropriate for TACC CMR
          members temporarily assigned to another MAF AOC (PACAF, USAFE). Specific
          training requirements will be defined by the gaining AOC.
      2.3.2.2. Augmentees from various mission design series (MDS) or other government
      agencies (OGA) may need AOC orientation and other training.
      2.3.2.3. Each AOC will present an orientation training program from which individual
      items are chosen as appropriate and may include the following subject areas:
          2.3.2.3.1. AOC fundamentals
          2.3.2.3.2. Unit mission or theater orientation
          2.3.2.3.3. Chain of command
          2.3.2.3.4. Applicable planning and execution documents
 30                                        AFI13-1AOCV1_AMCSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2013


          2.3.2.3.5. Augmentee positional responsibilities
   2.3.3. This training is in addition to mandatory AF training (e.g., information assurance [IA]
   training).
   2.3.4. (Added-AMC) Multi-Qualification. Personnel who are CMR in multiple positions
   must complete appropriate positional qualification requirements for each position. If an
   additional position is closely related to another in terms of job knowledge and requirements,
   it is not necessary to retrain the individual on these requirements. Assign all applicable
   positional MTLs to the individual and make an appropriate entry in the individual’s training
   record, to reflect all qualifications. Qualification time limitations apply IAW the positional
   MTPs. Planner’s Difference Track Courses are designed and tailored to the needs of
   individuals who are qualified in one specialty and re-assigned to another.
2.4. Trainer Program
   2.4.1. The AOC weapons system is not similar to other weapons systems in that active duty
   personnel are normally assigned for only one tour. Therefore, the AOC WS does not have a
   formal program to develop and certify trainers for a career. AOC personnel selected to
   perform as trainers are considered by AOC leadership as highly proficient in division and
   team processes or a particular AOC WS application. They will complete local AOC trainer
   program requirements below and are not required to complete any formal USAF
   trainer/instructor program in order to be considered an AOC trainer.
   2.4.2. AOC crew position trainers must be approved by the AOC or ARC aligned unit
   commander or commander designated division/team chiefs, and must be CMR in their
   current AOC crew position. Note: AOCs may elect to use a SME for certain elements of
   their training programs (e.g., theater/mission familiarization training, systems and
   applications, or designated processes). SMEs will not fill the role of duty position trainer but
   rather augment training given by the designated trainer.
      2.4.2.1. (Added-AMC) TACC trainers must be approved by the Director, and must be
      CMR in their current position.
   2.4.3. AOC crew position trainers will receive the following training from the unit TM:
      2.4.3.1. Unit training administrative practices to include filling out unit training
      documentation
      2.4.3.2. Trainer responsibilities
      2.4.3.3. Positional training techniques
      2.4.3.4. Briefing/Debriefing techniques
2.5. Training Documentation
   2.5.1. AOC crewmember documentation: Units must maintain a permanent training record
   in LMS which contains the following milestones: DAS, training start dates, IQT and MQT
   training dates, IQT graduation/completion date, MQT training completion date, CMR award
   date, N-CMR events, deployment dates and associated orientation training, and any other
   significant training dates. ARC aligned units will maintain their own records in LMS.
AFI13-1AOCV1_AMCSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                      31


     2.5.1.1. (Added-AMC) The TACC maintains a permanent training record in a Learning
     Management System (LMS) and paper based records. The UTMs, DTMs, and
     supervisors will document training and maintain a permanent training record for unit
     personnel. Training specific to 618 AOC will be documented using approved electronic
     or paper-based training records.
  2.5.2. Orientation documentation: The content of the orientation training provided must be
  documented.
  2.5.3. Annual Training Plan (ATP): All AOCs, and ARC aligned units, will develop an
  annual training plan which should include the following elements:
  2.5.3. (AMC) The TACC Annual Training Plan (ATP) is reviewed annually by the TACC
  Training Advisory Board. The ATP is appended by the Directorate MTPs. MTPs are
  updated annually and approved by the applicable Director.
     2.5.3.1. AOC crewmember positions (those AFI 13-1AOC Vol 3 positions either manned
     or expected to be filled with a requirement to train).
     2.5.3.2. Unique AOC positions mapped against IQT options (FTU, ADL, or IUIQT).
     2.5.3.3. Additional CT training requirements (in addition to Attachment 3).
     2.5.3.4. Event or methodology used to accomplish training, i.e.        part task trainer,
     Exercise Key Resolve, etc.
     2.5.3.5. Mission execution, mission planning, or academic event from attachment 3 or
     MAJCOM requirements.
  2.5.4. Unit Training Documentation (Electronically in LMS)
     2.5.4.1. Position Training Form (Example ACC Form 206, AETC Form 186)
     2.5.4.2. Position 797/TTL
     2.5.4.3. AF Forms 4141 and 4142
     2.5.4.4. Any other unit, to include trainer training as well as MAJCOM directed training
     documentation.
2.6. Reportable Items to MAJCOM OPR
  2.6.1. IQT timeline exceeded (including extensions). Report action taken. Will be reported
  quarterly, (E-mail memo)

Terms
Ancillary Training—Training that contributes to mission accomplishment, but is separate from
Air Force Specialty or occupational series training (further defined on the ETCA website,
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/default1.asp). Ancillary training does not constitute AOC training.
AOC Type—Refers to AOC categorization as either Geographic or Functional (see Geographic
and Functional AOC definitions). AOC training instructions applicable to all AOC types are
located in Chapter 1. AOC training instructions specific to Geographic AOCs are located in
Chapter 2. AOC training instructions for the Functional AOCs are located in subsequent
chapters as outlined in the Table of Contents. While Chapter 1 is applicable to all AOCs,
 38                                       AFI13-1AOCV1_AMCSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2013


subsequent chapters may be more restrictive but not less than Chapter 1. Note: the term "CAF"
AOCs refers to Geographic AOCs plus the 608th.
Augmentee—Personnel filling AOC positions on a temporary, short-term basis (i.e. TDY to
exercises or contingencies). Augmentees require tailored orientation training, and may require
positional training. Augmentee AOC training is the responsibility of the gaining AOC.
Basic Qualification (BQ)— An AOC crewmember who has completed IQT but not completed
MQT. They are able to perform basic AOC positional activities for which they have been
trained.
Certification—Designation of an AOC crewmember-trainee by the AOC/CC, as having
successfully completed MQT (including positional review, debrief, and any directed additional
training), and requisite mission qualification examination (MQE). Certification may result in
CMR status. Certification also applies to AOC crewmember upgrade to trainer.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)— The qualification status of an AOC crewmember who
successfully completes IQT and MQT training requirements, passes initial and mission
qualification testing (if applicable) and has been certified by the commander or designated
representative.
Currency— AFI does not mandate currency with respect to accomplishment of CT
requirements. There is no measure of time between required CT events (e.g. Push an ATO
every 45 days). Thus, if AOCs elect to impose currency requirements, they should be designed
to ensure the average crewmember maintains a minimum level of proficiency in a given duty or
task. Currency differs from CT periods and requirements per this AFI, in that currency refers to
periods of time linked directly to events (such as a pilot having to perform a landing within 30
days of his last accomplished landing). CT periods refer to timeframes during which a set
number of events must be accomplished.
Functional AOC— One of the two AOC Types, along with Geographic. Functional AOCs
have function-specific missions which are worldwide in scope, in support of a Functional
Combatant Command. They include 608th (Global Strike), 614th (Space), 618th (Mobility),
and 623rd (Special Ops).
Geographic AOC— One of the two AOC Types, along with Functional. Geographic AOCs
have broad-ranging missions which are constrained in scope to a geographic Area of
Responsibility, in support of a Geographic Unified (or Sub-unified) Combatant Command.
They include 601st, 603rd, 607th, 609th, 611th, 612th, 613th and 617th.
Liaison Officer (LNO)—Allied nation, sister service, other government agencies, or unique
major weapons system/mission representative working for their own respective commander but
providing planning/tasking expertise and coordination capability in support of the AOC. AOCs
will provide and document orientation training to LNOs to facilitate integration.
Non-Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR)— The qualification status of an individual who, having
achieved CMR status, regresses due to failure to accomplish mandatory CT requirements. See
respective AOC type chapter for consequence and repair of N-CMR status. See definition of
Unqualified for distinction from N-CMR.
Requalification Training—Tailored training for formerly-CMR AOC crewmembers that have
become unqualified for any reason. Objective is return to CMR status. Completion will be
AFI13-1AOCV1_AMCSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                         39


followed by positional re-evaluation and accomplishment of recurring qualification examination
(RQE). AOC TMs will coordinate with applicable division/team training personnel and if
necessary, Stan/Eval, to identify performance deficiencies and create appropriate requalification
training plans. Requalification training plans require AOC/CC approval.
Trainer—CMR AOC crewmember, authorized via AOC trainer upgrade program and AOC/CC
certification, to conduct AOC crewmember training. Trainers may also be contractors who were
previously qualified and hired for subject matter expertise. Further guidance in 2.4 of this AFI.
Training Task List (TTL)—Documentation of total training tasks developed for a prime
mission system and its respective mission. It includes the entire spectrum of tasks in each
functional area requiring training. The TTL provides the training task baseline for all
acquisition, modification, support, management, and funding actions through comparison with
predecessor or future prime mission systems (AFI 36-2251, Management of Air Force Training
Systems). MAJCOMs with their respective AOCs develop AOC TTLs. AOC Training TTLs
will be approved by HQ USAF/A3O. All CAF MQT TTLs for AFI 13-1AOCV3 listed duty
positions must be standardized through ACC/A3C. TTLs will be posted to the AOC CoP.
Type 1 Training—Contract training by civilian industrial institutions, supporting initial cadres
of trainers and operators the Air Force requires for new or modified AOC systems (often referred
to as "train the trainer").    The AOC TM will coordinate this training with AFMC/ESC,
specifically the SPO (ESC/HSGB).           Type 1 Training should be documented as such in
accordance with pertinent AOC Type chapter of this AFI.
Unqualified (UQ)—Previously CMR AOC crewmembers whose CMR status has lapsed due to
any of the following reasons: N-CMR in excess of six mos, PCS/PCA out of AOC crewmember
assignment, or AOC/CC-directed. See Requalification Training. Note, AOC crewmember-
trainees in IQT are not "unqualified," they are "not qualified.” In addition, those in MQT status

Terms
AMC C2 Course — Designed to provide fundamentals of AMC C2, Mission Management,
OPREP-3 Reporting, C2 Systems and the practical application of C2 concepts. This course is
designed for AFSC 1C3XX assigned to AMC and is taught by the USAF Expeditionary Center,
Mobility Operations School (MOS) Det 2 at Scott AFB.
Annual Training Plan (ATP) — The Annual Training Plan is the overarching document for
AOC Weapon System training. This document is required by AFI 13-1AOC, Vol 1, capturing
minimum training requirements to become Combat Mission Ready (CMR) Crewmembers, and is
augmented by detailed Directorate Master Training Plans (MTPs).
Basic Qualification (BQ) — A 618 AOC member who has completed IQT but not completed
MQT. BQ individuals are able to perform basic positional activities for which they have been
trained.
Certification — Designation of Combat Mission Ready of a member-trainee by the Director, as
having successfully completed MQT.

Combat Mission Ready (CMR) — CMR is the status required for 618 AOC personnel to
perform unsupervised, the primary duties tasked to their assigned directorate. To attain CMR
status, an individual must complete IQT, Directorate MQT for the member’s primary duty
position, and be deemed or certified CMR by the Director.
Continuation Training (CT) — CT, where applicable, provides personnel with the volume,
frequency, and mix of training necessary to maintain CMR status in their assigned position. CT
begins after personnel have attained CMR status. CT can be prorated by the Director for partial-
year adjustments or approved absences.
Crewmember — This term represents all assigned to the 618 AOC.
Cross-Functional Integration Course (CFIC) — A one-time Continuation Training seminar
which occurs 9-12 months after certification as CMR. This course is a refresher of Doctrine,
TACC operations, and integrated mission management. Students learn cross-directorate
processes by class participation in a scenario driven exercise.
Currency — Applies to Continuation Training. Currency differs from CT periods and
requirements per this AFI, in that currency refers to periods of time linked directly to events
(such as a pilot having to perform a landing within 30 days of his last accomplished landing). CT
periods refer to timeframes during which a set number of events must be accomplished.
Initial Qualification Training (IQT) — IQT consists of both core (GMAOC, GMAOF,
GMAOE) and specified track (GMAOT) training, providing members with the knowledge and
skills necessary to perform basic duties within the 618 AOC. Core training introduces newly
assigned personnel to the 618 AOC mission and provides basic division or team-level skills
without regard to specific 618 AOC directorates. Track training is more in-depth and applies to
specific 618 AOC directorates. Not all AOC positions have an associated GMAOT course.
NOTE: IQT completion gives members Basic Qualified/Non-Combat Mission Ready Status.
Mission Qualification Training (MQT) — MQT provides the training necessary to qualify
personnel in a specific position to perform the missions assigned to 618 AOC. MQT is a
directorate responsibility and gives members Combat Mission Ready Status. Personnel who have
completed IQT, or have IQT waived, are automatically entered into MQT on the next duty day.
Non-Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR) — 618 AOC personnel will be N-CMR for failing to
complete CT IAW the MTP or when the Director directs N-CMR status due to performance/
participation concerns. Delinquent/requalification training must be accomplished before a
member can perform unsupervised primary duties.
Requalification Training —Tailored training for formerly CMR members that have become
unqualified for any reason. Objective is return to CMR status. Completion will be followed by
positional re-evaluation and accomplishment of Recurring Qualification Examination (RQE).
TMs will coordinate with applicable Directorate training or evaluator personnel, to identify
performance deficiencies and create appropriate requalification training plans. Re-qualification
training plans require Commander approval.
Specialist — Member, or specialist
Trainer — CMR member, authorized via trainer upgrade program and Directors written
certification, to conduct member MQT or CT training. Trainers may also be contractors who
were previously qualified and hired for subject matter expertise.

Unqualified (UQ) — Previously CMR members whose CMR status has lapsed due to any of the
following reasons: N-CMR in excess of six months, PCS/PCA out of the AOC assignment, or
Commander directed. See Requalification Training. Note: member-trainees in IQT are not
"unqualified," they are “not qualified”. In addition, those in MQT status are not UQ rather BQ.
