SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This instruction
has been completely reorganized and updated concerning BASH management techniques, waiver
authorities, and overall responsibilities.
1. General. This instruction provides policy and guidance for the 552 ACW in support of the
Tinker AFB BASH Plan 91-212 and AFPAM 91-212, BASH Management Techniques. The
 2                                                                552ACWI91-212 17 MAY 2012


intent is to keep commanders and aircrew members informed and to aid them in making
decisions regarding the operation of aircraft at Tinker AFB and the local area.
     1.1. Waiver Authority. The 552 OG/CC is the final authority on flying activity during bird
     watch conditions. This authorization will be based on the assessment provided by the
     Supervisor of Flying (SOF). Recommended options include: limiting multiple touch and
     goâ€™s and low approaches, prohibiting takeoffs, landings, or practice approaches, directing
     pattern work be conducted at an alternate airfield, not scheduling takeoffs and landings
     during sunrise and sunset during BASH Phase II, allowing HHQ and contingency takeoffs
     and landings.
     1.2. Bird Watch Conditions (BWC). Flying operations will be restricted according to the
     following conditions:
     1.2.1. Bird Watch Condition LOW: Unrestricted operations.
     1.2.2. Bird Watch Condition MODERATE: Limited to initial takeoff and full stop landings
     only.
     1.2.3. Bird Watch Condition SEVERE: No takeoffs, landings, or approaches except for
     emergencies.
     1.3. Tinker AFB BASH Program. Refer to Tinker Air Force Base Plan 91-212
     Bird/Wildlife-Aircraft Strike Hazard Plan.
     1.3.1. 552 ACW/SE will post a corresponding FCIF Vol. V input within PEX advising
     aircrews of the BASH phase II implementation or termination.
     1.4. Transition. During BASH Phase II, transition will not be scheduled 1 hour before or
     after sunrise/sunset. Local incident data shows a marked increase in bird strikes during these
     hours and increased vigilance is essential to avoid large migratory birds. Additionally,
     transition will not be conducted at Will Rogers World Airport (KOKC) when Tinker AFB is
     in BWC MODERATE. If transition training is necessary and authorized by the OG/CC
     during bird condition BWC MODERATE, Tinker AFB should be the primary transition
     airfield to allow the SOF the ability to closely monitor bird activity.
        1.4.1. Crews shall utilize all available means to ensure they develop and maintain the
        highest awareness of BASH conditions. When mission planning for transition at airfields
        other than KTIK/KOKC, crews will check forecasted bird conditions using AHAS and/or
        BAM. Prior to departure, crews should contact the applicable base operations and
        reference NOTAMS, AP/1, IFR Supplement, and the Airfield Suitability Report in order
        to determine migratory periods or times of heavy bird concentration.
        1.4.2. During hours of darkness following sunset or prior to sunrise, it can be difficult for
        the SOF to properly assess the current bird condition. Crews are expected to use good
        judgment concerning the bird hazard while conducting transition and report any activity
        to the SOF. If a large number of birds are seen while in the local pattern, transition
        should be discontinued.
2. Responsibilities. Organizations/Individuals are responsible for the following BASH tasks:
     2.1. 552d ACW Command Post (552 ACW/CP). The Command Post, upon receiving
     information that a bird strike has occurred, will notify Base Operations, the MOC, the SOF,
552ACWI91-212 17 MAY 2012                                                                           3


  Wing Safety, and the applicable SQ/CC/DO. The applicable SQ/CC/DO will not be notified
  after duty hours unless the bird strike caused damage to the aircraft. If damage to the aircraft
  is reported, the Command Post will also notify the 552 ACW/CC/CV and 552 OG/CC. In
  the event the strike caused class A or B category damage to the aircraft, the 72 ABW/CC/CV
  will be notified.
     2.1.1. During duty hours, Command Post will notify the SOF, Base Operations, 552
     ACW Safety, MOC, and the 552 OG/CC when the bird condition changes. After normal
     duty hours, only the MOC, Base Operations, and the SOF will be contacted when the bird
     condition is changed.
  2.2. Maintenance Operations Center (MOC). When notified of a bird strike, the MOC
  will notify the Wing FOD NCO, Quality Assurance, and the 552 AMXS/CC. If there is
  damage to the aircraft, the MOC will also notify the 552 MXG/CC.
  2.3. 552 MXG Commander (552MXG/CC). The 552MXG/CC or designated
  representative will ensure that maintenance personnel who discover bird strikes contact the
  crew, the Command Post and Quality Assurance. Non-fleshy bird remains (feathers, beaks,
  feet, wet or dry blood samples) will be collected by ground recovery personnel using the bird
  strike collection kit (available in QA) and delivered to Wing Safety. Even the smallest
  fragments and blood samples will be forwarded to Wing Safety since they can provide
  enough evidence for the Smithsonian to complete bird identifications. Pictures of the
  damage and bird remains will also be taken and provided to Wing Safety.
  2.4. Supervisor of Flying (SOF). The SOF is the Wing focal point to for the current status
  of the bird watch condition. The SOF will monitor the airfield for bird activity. If the SOF
  determines that the bird watch condition needs to be updated, the SOF will contact Tinker
  Air Force Base Airfield Management to coordinate and disseminate the change to all
  required base agencies. After the bird condition has been changed, the SOF will notify
  Command Post. The SOF should make recommendations for operational restrictions to the
  552 OG/CC or designated OG representative if the official bird watch condition is not
  changed by the base.
     2.4.1. The SOF will use the hourly conditions and the 24 hour forecasted conditions
     located on the Avian Hazard Advisory System (http://www.usahas.com) website, in
     conjunction with local observation, to determine the airfield bird watch condition.
  2.5. Aircrews. If a crew observes or encounters bird activity while in the local pattern
  (KTIK or KOKC) they will notify the SOF. The following information should be included
  when reporting bird activity: call sign, locations, altitude, time of the sighting, type of bird (if
  known), approximate number of birds, and the behavior of the birds (soaring, migrating,
  remaining on the runway, etc.). Any aircrew experiencing a bird strike while airborne will
  notify the SOF, Tinker Control Tower, and the Command Post. If aircrews discover or are
  notified of a bird strike after departing the aircraft, the crew will notify the Command Post.
     2.5.1. Aircrews flying at bases other than Tinker who encounter a bird strike should
     contact the local SOF, airfield management, tower, and flight safety officer, if applicable.
     Upon landing, the aircrew will notify the 552 ACW/CP of the strike and ensure any
     remains are properly collected.
4                                                                 552ACWI91-212 17 MAY 2012


       2.5.2. Aircrews will obtain a copy of the 24 hour forecasted bird condition for all
       planned transition airfields on the Avian Hazard Advisory System
       (http://www.usahas.com) website.
       2.5.3. An AF IMT 853 (Non-damaging Bird Strike Report) and a 552 ACW 41 (552d Air
       Control Wing Aviation Incident Worksheet), will be completed electronically whenever
       possible by the aircraft commander and delivered to their squadron safety office anytime
       a bird strike occurs. If a unit safety representative is not available, email or fax the report
       to 552 ACW/SE, fax number 734-3740 or DSN 884-3740 and the 552 OG/CDF, fax
       number 734-5539 or DSN 884-5539. The completed 552 ACW 41 and AF IMT 853 will
       be turned in to the Wing Safety office NLT 24 hours of the incident.
    2.6. 552 ACW Safety. Upon notification of a BASH incident, Wing Safety will review the
    AF IMT 853, Non-damaging Bird Strike Report, and the 552 ACW 41, 552d Air Control
    Wing Aviation Incident Worksheet for content. If additional information is needed, Wing
    Flight Safety will contact the crew. Wing Safety will report the incident in AFSAS and
    receive a control number to be associated with any remains collected. Remains will be
    packaged for mailing using the information generated in AFSAS and delivered to the Tinker
    Air Force Base USDA representative for mailing to the Smithsonian Institute.
