                                                Chapter 1

                                ESSENTIAL PROGRAM ELEMENTS


1.1. General Requirements of the Alcohol Beverage Program.
    1.1.1. This instruction covers all alcoholic beverages that personnel sell, serve, or consume at Air
    Force bases.
    1.1.2. The minimum age for purchasing, serving, selling, possessing, or drinking alcoholic beverages
    on Air Force bases must be consistent with the law of the state, territory, possession, or foreign coun-
    try (all referred to as "state" for purposes of this paragraph) in which the installation is located.
       1.1.2.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEM) The minimum age for purchasing, serving, selling, possess-
       ing, or drinking alcoholic beverages on Spangdahlem AB, Germany, to include military, depen-
       dents and civilians, is 18 years of age.
    1.1.3. Servers and sellers of alcoholic beverages must verify the purchaser's age with a photo identi-
    fication card such as DD Form 2AF, a driver's license, or a passport. Proof of identification for the
    Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) is any active duty card, reserve card, or family mem-
    ber’s card.
    1.1.4. Adults may not provide alcoholic beverages to minors except in accordance with applicable
    state laws.
    1.1.5. The Air Force may punish a military member who violates these restrictions under Article 92,
    Uniform Code of Military Justice.
    1.1.6. Military personnel 18 years old or older may purchase, serve, sell, possess, and consume alco-
    holic beverages outside the United States, its territories, and possessions unless a higher drinking-age
    requirement exists in accordance with applicable status of forces or country-to-country agreements. A
    higher drinking age requirement may als be imposed based on the local situation as determined by the
    installation commander or the senior on-site unit commander when there is no installation com-
    mander. Coordination with any host commander is required.
    1.1.7. As states enact new drinking-age laws, installation commanders must make corresponding
    changes in base drinking-age guidance.
    1.1.8. The Air Force, consistent with mission needs, will cooperate with federal, state, and local offi-
    cials; however, there is no legal obligation to submit to state or local control or regulation.

1.2. Program Exceptions.
    1.2.1. MAJCOM, Director of Services (SV) may approve these exceptions to the standard guidance:
       1.2.1.1. At Air Force installations located within approximately 50 miles from a neighboring state
       that has a lower drinking age, the minimum base drinking age may be lowered to match that of the
       neighboring state to reduce the likelihood that members will drive while intoxicated.
       1.2.1.2. When an entire unit marks a unique or nonroutine military occasion on a military instal-
       lation, the minimum drinking age for attendees at a particular unit gathering may be lowered.

           • Beer, wine, and spirits.
       1.2.2.2. Each approval document must specifically state the alcoholic beverages that the excep-
       tion covers.
       1.2.2.3. MAJCOM/SV reevaluates the exceptions annually and sends an information copy of the
       continued exceptions to HQ AFSVA/SVOH.
       1.2.2.4. MAJCOM/SV must cancel all exceptions that no longer meet the above criteria.

1.3. Dram Shop Liability. To protect the assets and interests of Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities
(NAFI) and the Air Force, personnel must follow these procedures:

       Employee Brief, by signing underneath this statement: "I understand my responsibility under the
       dram shop theory of liability not to sell or serve alcoholic beverages to persons who appear to be
       nearing intoxication and not in complete control of their faculties." The statement is placed in the
       comments section of AF Form 971 by the servers' supervisors.

   vices commander or director (refer to AFI 34-408, Property and Casualty Program). AAFES activity
   managers will report to the AAFES general manager on the base.
   1.3.5. (Added-SPANGDAHLEM) The management of each activity selling or dispensing alcoholic
   beverages is responsible for adhering to AFI 34-219, Alcoholic Beverage Program, and it supple-
   ments, the Dram Shop Liability (see AFI 34-219, paragraph 1.3.), the enforcement of the Drunk and
   Drugged Driving Program (see AFI 34-219, paragraph 1.4.), and fully complying with the spirit and
   intent of the Alcoholic Deglamorization Policy (see AFI 34-219, paragraph 1.5.). Alcoholic beverages

    1.5.1. (SPANGDAHLEM) A listing of the 52d Fighter Wing Commander (52 FW/CC) approved sell-
    ing/serving hours for Services (SVS) facilities will be reviewed annually by the 52d Services Squad-
    ron Commander 52 (SVS/CC) to ensure they provide reasonable service, meet local conditions and
    recognize the needs of military personnel. The Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) Gen-
    eral Manager will do the same for the AAFES outlets.
       1.5.1.1. Use base media (newspapers, bulletins, etc.) to deglamorize alcohol, call for responsible

                                               Chapter 3

         SELLING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES FOR OFF-PREMISE CONSUMPTION


3.1. AAFES. AAFES is designated as the single manager of packaged alcoholic beverage (Class Six)
stores and the prime wholesaler of alcoholic beverages. The Air Force packaged beverage policy appears
in AFR 147-14 (to be AFJI 34-210), Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) Operating Policies.

3.2. Base Services Activities. Services and other Air Force activities may not compete with AAFES to
sell packaged alcoholic beverages. When approved by the installation commander, Services activities
may sell beer, wine coolers, and other commercially packaged alcoholic beverages with less than 7 per-
cent alcoholic content by volume for off-premises consumption, but must restrict these sales to time peri-
ods when AAFES-operated retail outlets are closed. Services may not offer alcohol for lower prices than
AAFES charges for the same item.
   3.2.1. Packaged beer or wine sales that Services offer as part of a party contract or takeout food and
   beverage operation are exempt from this restriction. Takeout operations normally may only sell
   6-pack containers and similarly packaged products. Party contracts include keg beer.
   3.2.2. Clubs may sell bottled wines and champagnes listed on the dining room wine list for
   off-premise consumption under these conditions:
       3.2.2.1. Clubs may not set up rooms separate from the dining room to display or sell for
       off-premise consumption.
       3.2.2.2. Clubs ensure that dining room list prices comply with the pricing policy specified in para-
       graph 3.6.
   3.2.3. At installations where the club or Class Six outlets sell exclusive of state tax, managers must
   ensure that sales are made only to patrons authorized to use the Class Six store (Refer to paragraph
   3.4. for specific instructions on authorized patronage and the attachment for the definition of Class
   Six). Managers must inform patrons of the maximum quantities that an individual may legally trans-
   port into or through the state, district, territory, or country where the installation-of-purchase is
   located.

3.3. Establishing Class Six Outlets.
   3.3.1. In the United States, installations may operate Class Six outlets when approved by the Secre-
   tary of the Air Force. AFR 147-14 (to be AFJI 34-210) contains procedures for establishing a Class
   Six store.
   3.3.2. In overseas areas, installations may operate Class Six outlets where there is no contradictory
   status-of-forces or other country-to-country or local governmental agreement.
       3.3.2.1. MAJCOMs or Field Operating Agencies (FOA) may approve such operations if
       requested by AAFES. MAJCOMs and FOAs must send an information copy of each approval to
       HQ AFSVA/SVOH at least 30 days prior to approving a new Class Six store.

3.4. Authorized Patronage.

     3.4.1. AFR 147-14 (to be AFJI 34-210) contains AAFES Class Six patronage restrictions and identi-
     fication procedures.
     3.4.2. Authorized patronage in overseas areas must comply with the provisions of the status-of-forces
     or other country-to-country agreements in each country.

3.5. Controlling Sales. Authorized patrons may not sell, exchange, or otherwise divert packaged alco-
holic beverages to unauthorized personnel or for purposes that violate federal, state, or local laws, or sta-
tus-of-forces or other country-to-country agreements.

3.6. Pricing. Services activity managers must make sure that their prices for packaged alcoholic bever-
ages that contain less than 7 percent alcohol by volume are substantially uniform with AAFES, but at no
lower price, and other military service outlets in the same geographic area.

3.7. Wholesale Sales. AAFES is the prime wholesaler of alcoholic beverages on Air Force installations.
     3.7.1. AAFES provides all requested alcoholic beverage products to authorized Services and
     NAF-supported base activities.
     3.7.2. If AAFES has stock shortages, activities selling alcoholic beverages by the drink have first pri-
     ority.
     3.7.3. AAFES sets wholesale prices based on the "landed cost" that a Class Six store pays for alcohol
     purchases (the purchase order price that the store pays, adjusted for vendor and invoice discounts, plus
     costs incurred to bring goods to the point of sale). AAFES assesses no additional transportation,
     warehousing distribution, or handling charges.
        3.7.3.1. AAFES notifies HQ AFSVA/SVOH if exceptional conditions (national disasters, trans-
        portation strikes, etc.) arise that affect wholesale prices.
     3.7.4. AAFES may offer wholesale prices on Class Six merchandise to organizations and activities
     that aren't Services or NAF-supported in accordance with AFR 147-14 (to be AFJI 34-210).
     3.7.5. Services and other NAF-supported activities may purchase alcoholic beverages from sources
     other than AAFES. Compliance with paragraph 1.6. is mandatory.

3.8. Labeling Packaged Alcoholic Beverages.
     3.8.1. Public Law 100-690, Title VIII, Alcoholic Beverages Labeling Act of 1988, 18 November
     1988, requires that all packaged containers of alcoholic beverages for resale on military installations
     bear this statement: GOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) According to the Surgeon General, women
     should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. (2) Con-
     sumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery and may
     cause health problems.
     3.8.2. This requirement also applies to foreign packaged beverages that Services activities serve or
     sell overseas.
     3.8.3. The selling activity's manager must label all beverages that the producer doesn't label. Follow
     these labeling requirements:
AFI34-219_SPANGDAHLEMSUP1_I 23 AUGUST 2002                                                              13


     3.8.3.1. PL 100-690 defines alcoholic beverages as any beverage in liquid form that contains not
     less than one-half of one percent (0.5 percent ) of alcohol by volume for human consumption.
     3.8.3.2. Design all labels to make the health warning statement readily legible under ordinary
     conditions. The statement must be on a contrasting background.
     3.8.3.3. Label all containers of 237 milliliters (8 ounces ) or less: 1 millimeter (0.04 inches) sized
     lettering.
     3.8.3.4. Label all containers of more than 237 milliliters (8 ounces ): 2 millimeters (0.08 inches)
     sized lettering.
     3.8.3.5. Affix labels on the container so they can't be removed without thorough application of
     water or other solvents.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS


9 SEPTEMBER 1998


This interim change (IC) authorizes installation commanders to increase the drinking age based on the
local conditions.


 1.1.6. Military personnel 18 years old or older may purchase, serve, sell, possess, and consume alcoholic
beverages outside the United States, its territories, and possessions unless a higher drinking age require-
ment exists in accordance with applicable status-of-forces or other country-to-country agreements. A
higher drinking age requirement may also be imposed based on the local situation as determined by the
installation commander or the senior on-site unit commander when there is no installation commander.
Coordination with any host commander is required.
