                                       AIR FORCE WEATHER

1.1. Introduction. Weather and warfare have been linked together throughout world history. The atmo-
sphere has the ability to either enhance or reduce the performance of aircraft systems. To effectively
accomplish the Air Force mission, and maintain the advantage “over” the battlefield, aircrews must have
a thorough awareness and understanding of the air or space environment in which they operate. The goal
of Air Force Weather (AFW) is to provide the Department of Defense (DoD) the knowledge needed to
“exploit the weather for battle.” Vast amount of weather information is available to you from various pro-
viders via web technology, but the timeliness and reliability can’t be guaranteed. Any attempt to capture
all of the private sector-information services would be beyond the scope of this publication. Therefore,
this text will summarize Air Force and civil government services, charts, and weather codes.

Figure 1.1. Air Force Weather Insignia.




Air Force Weather Mission Statement: “Deliver the highest quality mission-tailored weather and space
environment information, products, and services to our nations combat forces, anytime, anyplace… mud
to sun.”

1.2. AFW Organization. AFW services and support are organized under the functional management of
the Directorate of Weather, Deputy Chief of Staff for Air and Space Operations, Headquarters United
States Air Force (HQ USAF/XOW). AFW operates through a three-tier organizational structure corre-
sponding to the three levels of military operations - strategic, operational and tactical.

1.3. Strategic Level. AFW’s strategic weather units are centers of expertise in providing strategic-level
terrestrial and space weather products and support necessary to conduct military operations. The Air
Force Weather Agency (AFWA) is the principal strategic weather center, and it also provides select oper-
ational and tactical-level support to special operations. Space support is provided primarily by the Space
Operations Cell (AFWA/SPACEWOC). Finally, The Air Force Combat Climatology Center (AFCCC)
provides centralized climatological data services.
    1.3.1. Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA). AFWA, located at Offutt AFB, Nebraska, produces
    mission-tailored, global weather products and services 24 hours a day to meet the requirements of the
    DoD. AFWA provides regional, theater-scale meteorological model outputs to operational and tacti-
    cal-level weather units. AFWA services include meteorological satellite imagery meteorological guid-

   ance, aviation, automated flight planning, exercise and special mission support and computations for
   ballistic missile systems as well as the collection and dissemination of environmental data.
   1.3.2. The Space Operations Cell. AFWA/SPACEWOC, located at Offutt AFB, Nebraska, provides
   space environmental support for worldwide operations. Space Weather (SW) includes the study of
   solar storms, geomagnetic storms, and ionospheric disturbances. SW agencies process data from
   ground and space-based sensor networks, analyze models, and forecast the space environment. They
   provide alerts, warnings, and assessments for operational impacts. Systems routinely supported
   include satellite vehicle and payload operations, ground and satellite-based communications, naviga-
   tion, surveillance and weapon system radars, as well as high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and the
   Space Shuttle. They predict solar weather effects on ultra-high frequency (UHF)(Figure 1.2.), radar,
   and Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation signals. To receive space weather data, submit your
   request for support through your local supporting Combat Weather Team (CWT) or Operational
   Weather Squadron (OWS).

Figure 1.2. UHF Impacts Forecast.




   1.3.3. The Air Force Combat Climatology Center (AFCCC). The Air Force Combat Climatology
   Center (AFCCC), located in Asheville, NC, collects worldwide climatological data to create products
   that provide critical information based on past weather (Figure 1.3.). Examples of climatological
   products include typical target weather conditions, frequency of weather limitations at deployed loca-
   tions, weather limitations on weapon system employment, and crosswind studies. Military planners
   use this information to maximize the advantage of the weather to the warfighter and minimize the
   impact of adverse conditions on friendly operations. Coordinate with your local CWT or OWS to
   request AFCCC support.

1.4. Operational Level. AFW’s Operational Weather Squadrons (OWSs) are theater or regional centers.
Eight OWSs provide operational-level support to CWTs, units assigned within, or deployed to, its theater
Commander-in-Chief (CINC) geographic Areas of Responsibility (AOR). Staff Weather Officers (SWOs)
assigned to USAF Major Commands (MAJCOMs), USA Major Commands (MACOMs), and Unified
Commands provide direct support to these Headquarters and oversee AFW support to the Command’s
forces. OWS support includes: regional and theater scale battlespace forecasts, drop and landing-zone/
range/air refueling/target forecasts, mission executive level briefings, weather watches, warnings, and
forecast advisories, and Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs) for each base within their region. The
OWS provides briefing support to transient aircrews or aircrews not collocated with a CWT. OWS loca-
tions and AORs are shown in Figure 1.4. through Figure 1.13. OWS Phone numbers are in the DoD FLIP
Supplement and Flight Information Handbook.

1.5. Tactical Level. AFW support to operational USAF and USA field units is organized for tactical,
mission-specific operations. A Combat Weather Team (CWT) is a generic term used to describe a weather
team providing mission tailored products and services to a supported unit. CWTs are normally organized
as Weather Flights (WF) under Operations Support Squadrons (OSS) for USAF operations, or may be
organized as Detachments (Det) or Combat Weather Squadrons (CWS) under Air Support Operations
Groups (ASOG) for USA operations. CWTs deploy with operational warfighters as required. The CWT is
the cornerstone of support to operational field unit mission. It is likely your interactions will be limited to
contact with the CWT and OWS. CWTs provide aircrew and flight safety briefings, Pilot-to-Metro Ser-
vice (PMSV) support, mission-tailored products (Mission Execution Forecasts (MEF)), MISSION-
WATCH (monitors supported customer’s flying areas, routes, and missions), METWATCH (monitors
OWS produced forecasts, issues “observed” weather advisories and warnings), surface observations, Tac-
tical Decision Aids (TDAs), and Integrated Weather and Environment Decision Aid (IWEDA) to predict
go/no go weather thresholds. Other responsibilities include resource protection for DoD personnel and
assets by keeping commanders abreast of weather watches, warnings and advisories. Briefers provide tai-
lored aircrew briefings for each phase of flight. Briefings are available in-person, via telephone or in some
circumstances closed circuit monitor. Most CWTs do not maintain a continuous 24-hour briefing and
forecasting service. If weather services are unavailable at your location, contact the regional OWS or
MAJCOM approved source.
   1.5.1. Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Reserve Component (ARC) Weather. T h e s e
   resources primarily support Air Force and Army wartime deployment and employment requirements.
   Selected ARC resources will support rotational (i.e., Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF)) taskings
   on a volunteer basis and sustainment missions as requirements dictate. To the maximum extent possi-
   ble, ARC personnel will train with and support their wartime units.

1.6. OWS-CWT-Aircrew Interface. The continuous interface between the OWS, CWT, and aircrew is
essential for mission support improvement and mission success. OWSs create products and monitor
weather for its CINC’s AOR. Thus, OWS technicians develop long-term weather knowledge for the
AOR. This improves theater forecast quality and mission support. One example of OWS-CWT interface
occurs during the forecast (TAF) process. OWSs’ coordinate forecast content with the local CWT before
issuing the TAF for the CWT’s base. CWTs monitor the TAF and notify the OWS when conditions are
met requiring a TAF amendment. Deployed CWTs will use the AOR OWS for support. Thus, an aircrew
deployed within its CINC’s AOR is serviced by the same OWS and/or CWT as home base. If your
assigned CWT is not deployed with you, it still must arrange your TDY weather support. OWSs will sup-
port aircrews in their AOR when no CWT is assigned or available.
   1.6.1. CWT-Aircrew Interface. CWT-aircrew interface enhances mission support. CWTs work with
   aircrews to learn aircraft capabilities, mission profiles and tactics. This ensures CWTs understand mis-
   sion impacts. CWTs use this information to determine the best mission support products. CWTs can
   show you how these products are used to create MEFs resulting in a more knowledgeable aircrew.
   Post-mission feedback of the weather encountered vice the MEF allows CWTs to evaluate effective-
   ness. CWTs use this to adjust future MEFs resulting in improved mission support.

                                         GRAPHIC CHARTS

2.1. Overview. Graphic charts are produced by multiple sources within both the military and civilian
arena. Thus, details for the variety of charts is beyond the scope of this publication. This is to give a
broad-brush description of some of the symbols and products you will encounter. Most civilian and all
military units producing graphic products will use standard weather symbols, line types, color representa-
tions, and isopleths. No product will provide all the needed operational information. Use products in com-
bination and with weather technician input.

2.2. Standard Weather Symbols . These representations, symbols, and isopleths commonly used are
defined in MIL-STD-2525B, Common Warfighting Symbology. Figure 2.1. depicts lines and colors for
isopleths. Figure 2.2. shows shading and color fill for bounded areas of specific weather parameters. Fig-
ure 2.3. shows fronts and other weather features. Figure 2.4. depicts criteria and shading for USAF pro-
duced Military Weather Advisory (MWA) products.

     2.2.2. Winds. Wind information plotted uses the “Shaft-Barb-Pennant” method (Figure 2.5.). The
     FROM direction which the wind is blowing is represented by the “shaft” or a line. The wind speed is
     represented by the barb or pennant. A short barb represents 5 knots and a long barb represents 10
     knots. Pennants are 50-knot winds. Wind directions are plotted to the nearest 10 degrees relative to
     true north.

   2.2.3. Station Symbols. Station Symbols provide a detailed graphic representation of present
   weather at individual stations to include cloud type, sky coverage, sea-level pressure (mb), 3-hour
   barometric change, pressure, present weather, past 6-hour weather, temperature, dew point, visibility
   (sm), wind speed (kts) and direction. Weather stations commonly use software packages to filter the
   various elements on the station model to make the symbol less cluttered and easier to read. This capa-
   bility also provides elements that are relevant to the user. A complete station model is below (Figure
   2.6.).

     2.3.1. Military Weather Advisory. The Military Weather Advisory (MWA) (Figure 2.10.) is a
     graphic depicting possible adverse weather and is updated every 6-8 hours. Use the contents of this
     advisory strictly as a preflight aid to identify areas of severe weather. Figure 2.4. shows the key for
     hazards forecasted. Hazard areas are enclosed by solid lines and identified by block letters. Always
     reference the MWA before every flight!! Always receive periodic updates from enroute advisory ser-
     vices (i.e., PMSV, ATC, etc.).

   2.4.1. Surface Graphics. OWSs continuously create surface weather graphics for its AOR (Figure
   2.13.). These will depict frontal positions, locations of pressure system centers and precipitation areas,
   type and intensity. These are made available to all CWTs supporting AOR military operations. In trop-
   ical regions, streamlines are used in place of isobars and circulation centers instead of pressure cen-
   ters. CWTs visually integrate real-time surface weather observations, radar, satellite imagery and
   other data with AFWA and OWS surface analyses.

2.5. Graphics Availability. All OWSs will produce a suite of “standard products” analogous to the pre-
vious examples, and each OWS may produce other mission specific products. OCONUS data unavailabil-
ity may limit creation of some products. Once you arrive at a new location, contact the CWT to find out
what products are available for your AOR. CWTs can provide information on the types of products avail-
able, production and amendment cycles, and answers on product information displayed.
   2.5.1. Other Graphic Websites. There is a multitude of civilian-created weather products available
   on the Internet. Descriptions and addresses are well beyond the scope of this handbook. If you can’t
   use a CWT or OWS web site and must use a civilian site, ensure it is MAJCOM approved before pro-
   ceeding. You should contact your CWT or OWS for verbal information to support the data from what-
   ever site you’re using.

3.1. METAR Code. Aviation Routine Weather Reports (METAR) is the observation code used to report
meteorological data. Full code details are found in AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations. Ele-
ments within the METAR report include: wind, visibility, runway visual range, present weather, sky con-
dition, temperature, dew point, and altimeter setting. Plain language information (Remarks) may be
appended to the report. METAR was adopted by international agreement for worldwide use, but each
country can modify the code (i.e. use meters vice miles).
     3.1.1. Report Type . METAR is a scheduled observation taken between 55-59 minutes past the hour
     (a.k.a. hourly observation). SPECI (Special Report) is an unscheduled observation taken when a pre-
     defined condition criteria change occurs. “Local” Observations are taken for condition change signif-
     icant to a given airfield’s operations. Locals are not disseminated outside of the local base.

   3.1.3. Date and Time of Issuance. The 7-character group after the identifier is the date and time of
   issuance. The first two digits are the date; the last four digits are time (UTC).
Example: 01 is the date of the month, 1657 is the time, “Z” is the time designator.

   3.1.4. ASOS Designators and Correction Modifiers. AUTO refers to an observation taken from an
   unattended Automated Surface Observation System (ASOS). AO1 is an ASOS without a rain vice
   snow discriminator. AO2 is an ASOS with a rain vice snow discriminator. COR is an observation cor-
   rected for an error. Disregard the previous transmission.

   3.1.5. Wind Speed and Direction. Reported wind direction is in magnetic north because runways
   and aircraft instruments are oriented toward magnetic north. Winds transmitted long-line are reported
   in knots (kts) and true direction. The wind will be reported as prevailing, gust, or squall. Prevailing
   (sustained) is the most common and is the average direction/speed over the 2 minutes (10 mins OCO-
   NUS) immediately preceding the observation. Gusts are a sudden, brief increase in speed (with a vari-
   ation of 10 knots or more between peaks and lulls) during the 10 minutes immediately preceding the
   observation. A squall is characterized by a very large variation of wind speed. It is often accompanied
   by a shower or thunderstorm. The term “squall’ is used when the speed increases by at least 16 knots
   and is sustained at 22 knots or more for at least 1 minute. The first three wind group digits will be the
   true (from) direction to the nearest 10 degrees and the next two digits are speed. If winds are gusting,
   the next two or three digits immediately following the letter “G” will be the gust speed or peak wind
   speed.

   Example: The 25015G30KT group is the wind direction and speed. Therefore, 250 degrees is the
   direction (true), 15 kts is the sustained wind speed and 30 kts is the gust.

M01 A2984 RMK SLP034


   3.1.6. Wind Variability. Wind variability is reported if the direction varies by 60 degrees and speeds
   greater than 6 kts. This group has the direction extremes, separated by “V.”

   Example: 210 and 290 are the two directional limits.

     3.1.7. Visibility. Prevailing visibility is the greatest horizontal visibility observed throughout at least
     half the horizon circle, and is not necessarily continuous. Sector visibility is reported in Remarks, if it
     differs from the prevailing and is less than 3 miles. Overseas locations will report visibilities in meters
     vice statute miles. The largest reportable metric value is 9999. This equates to visibility which is
     greater than 9000 meters (7 statute miles or greater).
Example: 3/8SM (statute miles) is the prevailing visibility. See Attachment 2 for Statute Miles to
Meters Conversion Chart

M01 A2984 RMK SLP034

     3.1.8. Runway Visual Range. Runway Visual Range (RVR) is reported when the prevailing visibil-
     ity is one statute mile or less and/or the RVR for the designated runway is 6,000 feet/1830 meters or
     less. Based on a ten-minute average, RVR follows the visibility and begins with “R.” Locations with-
     out ten-minute average capability will use a one-minute average to report locally and RVRNO lon-
     gline. The runway heading will follow the “R,” thus, “32L” represents runway 32-Left (C-Center,
     R-Right). The last four digits report the visibility in feet (meters used overseas).
Example: RVR reads “runway visual range for 32 Left is 1,000 ft.”

M01 A2984 RMK SLP034
Examples of RVR code:


M0600FT                 RVR is less than 600 feet. (M=less than)
P6000FT                 RVR is greater than 6,000 feet. (P = greater than)
R06L2000V4000FT Indicates variable, if the RVR is variable between two thresholds.
                R06L/2000V4000FT is RVR for 6 Left is variable between 2,000 and 4,000 feet.
     3.1.9. Type of Weather. If there is any precipitation or obstruction to visibility, it will be found in the
     group of data following the visibility. The absence of weather or an obscuration group indicates that
     neither phenomenon has occurred at the time of the observation. In this example, “FG” represents
     “Fog.” To define a weather group, look for these key elements (one or more may be omitted): intensity
     (symbol preceding the code), proximity, descriptor, precipitation description, obscuration (other than
     precipitation), and other. See Weather and Obscuration Conversion Table (Figure 3.2.).

     precipitation amounts) with the TAF 5xxxx (turbulence) and 6xxxx (icing).
Example: The remark SLP is the sea level pressure in millibars (hectopascals) to the nearest tenth. Place
a “10” or “9” before the group and a decimal before the last digit (use 10 if the 3 digit value is 400 or less).
The group in the example would read “1003.4 millibars.”

3.2. Aerodrome Forecast (TAF). Forecasts advise of expected conditions, hazardous weather and assist
in determining mission fuel needs. The TAF is a forecast for a particular terminal covering a period of
time up to 24 hours. A TAF contains a forecast of wind, prevailing visibility, precipitation and/or obstruc-
tion to visibility, sky coverage (eighths), icing, turbulence, minimum altimeter setting and pertinent plain
language remarks. Full code details can be found in AFMAN 15-124, Meteorological Codes. OWSs are
primarily responsible for AOR airfield TAFs. If National Weather Service or indigenous weather service
issues a TAF meeting supported unit requirements, an OWS TAF is not issued.
   3.2.1. Type of Report. TAF is an airport forecast for a specific period (usually 24 hours). AMD
   (Amended TAF) is issued and supersedes the previous TAF because the TAF is no longer representa-
   tive of the current or expected weather. Below, the TAF was amended at 1820Z. COR (Corrected
   TAF) is a TAF that has been corrected and supersedes previous TAFs. The AMD was corrected at
   1825Z. Refer to the time in the last text line for the current forecast.

   time) and the forecast valid times (from 5/12Z to 6/12Z). In a military TAF (KBLV), the group fol-
   lowing the ICAO identifier will be the preparation date (time is omitted) and valid times of the fore-
   cast (from 5/06Z to 6/06Z).

     3.2.4. Change Groups. The type of change and times expected are encoded with TEMPO, FM and
     BECMG. TEMPO 1316 is a “Temporary condition between 13Z and 16Z.” FM is “from” and
     indicates a rapid change, and supersedes the previous line conditions. FM 1600 is read “From 16Z.”
     BECMG represents “becoming” or a “gradual change” in the predominant condition by the end time
     listed. BECMG 2224 is “Becoming from 22Z to 24Z.” PROB40 (civilian use only) represents a
     40% probability of associated weather conditions occurring. PROB40 0006 2SM TSRA
     0VCOO8CB is read “40% probability between 00Z and 06Z of 800 overcast cumulonimbus clouds,
     visibility 2 statute miles in moderate thunderstorms.”

     3.2.5. Wind Speed and Direction. After valid time is forecast wind direction/speed. The first three
     digits are the true direction to the nearest 10 degrees. The last two digits are the sustained speed in
     knots (KT). Internationally, winds may be kilometers per hour (KMH) or meters per second (MPS).
     Gusts are depicted by “G.” VRB are winds with variable directions: that can’t be forecasted with con-
     fidence due to thunderstorms, are less than 6 kts, or varying for more than 60 degrees. The latter has a
     group depicting the direction range (i.e. 210V300)


Example: 14005KT, 16010KT, VRB15G30KT, 29008KT, 31012G22KT and 30008KT are the direc-
tion and speed groups. In the first group, 140 degrees (true) is the direction, 05 kts is speed. VRB are
winds with variable directions (thunderstorms) at 15KT, with 30 KT Gusts.

   3.2.6. Forecast Visibility. Military and overseas locations forecast visibilities in meters (the group
   after the winds). 9999 is the maximum value forecasted and indicates visibility greater than 9000
   meters (7 statute miles or greater). Overseas locations may use “CAVOK” (ceiling and visibility OK).
   This indicates no significant weather, visibility is 10 km or greater and ceilings greater than 5,000 ft.
   Civilian CONUS TAFs use statute miles (SM).


Example: Military - 8000, 3200, 1600, 3200 and 9999 are the visibilities in meters.

   3.2.7. Forecast Weather. Forecast weather is found in the group following the visibility. Absence of
   a weather group indicates that no weather is expected during the forecast period.

   Example: BR is Mist, -SHRA is Lt Rain Showers, TSRA is Thunderstorms with moderate Rain,
   -RA is Light Rain, and NSW (no significant weather) is used to indicate the weather listed in the pre-
   vious group is no longer expected to occur. NSW does NOT indicate the absence of clouds or hazards
   pertinent to your aircraft type. See Figure 3.2. for full decode list.

2. The next digit will determine the icing type and intensity (6 2 0 3 0 4).
3. Next three digits determine the base of the icing layer in hundreds of feet (6 2 0 3 0 4).
4. The next digit determines thickness in thousands of feet (6 2 0 3 0 4), add to base to determine icing
conditions top. Example: Light icing in cloud (RIME), 3,000 - 7,000 ft.

1. The turbulence designator “5” that follows the cloud or icing group (5 2 0 0 0 4).
2. Next digit determines the intensity (5 2 0 0 0 4).
3. Next three digits determine the base limit of the layer in hundreds of feet (5 2 0 0 0 4).
4. The last digit will determine the thickness in thousands of feet (5 2 0 0 0 4), add this value to the base
height to determine the top limit of the turbulence conditions. Below, the turbulence forecast is occasional
moderate turbulence in clear air from surface to 4,000 feet.

     3.2.11. Lowest Altimeter Setting. Forecast minimum altimeter settings are only found in military
     forecasts. These begin with QNH (minimum) and end with INS (inches).
Example: QNH2958INS, QNH2952INS and QNH2950INS are read as minimum altimeter setting of
29.58, 29.52 and 29.50 inches of mercury, respectively. Internationally, some countries use hectopascals
or millibars (Q1016) to measure pressure. See Attachment 4 for conversions.

     3.2.12. Forecast Wind Shear. Wind shear is included if non-convective low level winds (up to 2,000
     feet above ground level (AGL)) will change in speed and/or direction and result in shear. Wind shear
     is encoded with the contraction, WS, followed by a 3-digit height, slant character “/,” and winds at the
     height indicated. The remark WSCONDS is used to indicate potential wind shear when there is not
     enough information available to reliably predict the exact height, direction and speed of the wind
     shear.

   3.2.13. Temperatures. Forecast temperatures are routinely found only in military TAFs. Forecast
   temperatures are found on the first or last line (depending on MAJCOM requirements) following the
   minimum altimeter and begin with the designator “T.”

Example: Minimum temperature for this period of time (12Z to 12Z) is minus 1 or -1 °C and will occur
at 11Z. The maximum temperature is 8°C and will occur at 18Z.

3.3. Pilot Reports. A Pilot Report (PIREP) is an aircrew report of weather conditions at altitude. The
Flight Information Handbook has the format for transmittal by aircrews. PIREPs are extremely important
to operations. Airborne crews can see a broader horizon and experience phenomena, which may be hidden
from the ground observer’s view. For example, cloud bases and tops, turbulence and icing may only be
evident to airborne crew. While ground observations contain valuable information, they may not meet the
need for information on weather conditions at altitude. Weather technicians use PIREPs to service other
aircrews and to aid forecasting. PIREPs are transmitted over selected navigational aids and weather data
nets. Air traffic controllers will relay PIREPs to other affected aircrews and weather technicians.
   3.3.1. PIREP Text. The format includes a “message type” (UUA: urgent; UA: routine) and text
   element indicators preceding data groups. Indicators consist of a slash (/), two letters, and a space
   (except for “FL” which is not followed by a space. Aircraft position is relative to an ICAO, omnirange
   transmitter TACAN, VORTAC, or VOR, with a six digit group giving the relative bearing (first three
   digits) and distance (last three digits) from the omnirange. “DURGC” (during climb) or “DURGD”
   (during descent) indicates PIREPS received by aircraft taking-off or landing. Full code details can be
   found in AFMAN 15-124, Meteorological Codes.

A. Hail (GR or GS)
B. Low-Level Wind Shear (LLWS)
C. Severe icing
D. Severe or extreme turbulence, including Clear Air Turbulence (CAT)
E. Tornado, funnel cloud, or waterspout (FC).
F. Volcanic Eruption and/or Ash (VA), in the air or on the ground.
G. Any condition that, in the judgment of the person entering the PIREP into the system, would present an
extreme hazard to flight.


Example: Regular PIREP from 315 degrees and 45 miles from Scott AFB, 2224Z, at an unknown flight
level. Aircraft is a C-9, observed a broken line of thunderstorms aligned north to south with occasional
lightning from cloud to cloud and from cloud to ground. Cloud bases are at 3,000 ft, unknown total sky
cover and cloud tops at 34,500 ft.

web pages. These are issued at very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) facilities. Contact the
CWT, OWS, or nearest civilian Flight Service Station (FSS) to determine whether the advisory is perti-
nent to your flight. Advisories include: Severe Weather Forecast Alert (AWW), Significant Meteorologi-
cal Reports (SIGMET) and Airman’s Meteorological Information (AIRMET).
     3.6.1. Severe Weather Forecast Alert (AWW). AWW is a preliminary message used to alert airmen
     that a Severe Weather Bulletin (WW) is being issued. AWW defines an area of possible severe thun-
     derstorms or tornado activity.

Example: MKC AWW 655 WW 279 SEVERE TSTM NY PA NJ 1630Z-1700Z. 70 STATUTE MILES

MAX TOPS TO 540. MEAN WIND VECTOR 19020. REPLACES WW 278. OH PA NY
     3.6.2. Significant Meteorological Event (SIGMET). SIGMETs are issued for observed or forecast
     non-thunderstorm related hazards:

1.      Severe or extreme turbulence and CAT not associated with thunderstorms.
2. Severe icing not associated with thunderstorms
3. Dust storms, sandstorms or volcanic ash lowering visibilities to less than three miles
4. Volcanic eruption
        3.6.2.1. Convective SIGMET. Convective SIGMETs (WST) are issued by time and region, and
        are associated with thunderstorms. WSTs are issued hourly as required. They are valid for two
        hours or until superseded. Bulletins consist of an observation and/or a forecast. WSTs cover one of
        three areas: Eastern (E), Central (C), and Western (W), defined by longitudinal boundaries of 87
        and 107 degrees West. Hourly, an Outlook is issued for each region. The Outlook is a 2-6 hour
        projected thunderstorm activity discussion listed at the end of the WST and is updated as required.
        WSTs are issued for:

1. Severe thunderstorm with surface winds greater than or equal to 50 knots
2. Hail greater than or equal to3/4 inches in diameter
3. Tornados
4. Embedded thunderstorms
5. A line of thunderstorms
6. Thunderstorms greater than or equal to VIP 4 (see Figure 5.4.) affecting 40% or more of a 3,000
square mile area

     3.6.3. Airmen’s Meteorological Information (AIRMET). AIRMETs amend area forecasts con-
     cerning weather phenomena which are of operational interest and potentially hazardous to aircraft
     having limited capability. AIRMETs concern weather of less severity than that covered by SIGMETs.
     AIRMETS affect at least a 3,000 square mile area. Large regions mean only a small part of the area
     could be affected at any given time. AIRMETs are designated:

Sierra Bulletin (reserved for IFR and mountain obscuration)
1. Ceilings less than 1000 feet and /or visibility less than 3 miles affecting over 50% of the area
2. Extensive mountain obscuration

Tango Bulletin (reserved for wind related phenomena)
1. Moderate turbulence
2. Sustained surface winds of 30 knots or more

Zulu Bulletin (reserved for icing and freezing level data)
1. Moderate icing
2. Freezing levels

3.7. Aircraft Reports (AIREP). An AIREP is an automatic in-flight report generated at routine intervals
along a route. This report relays information on flight level, winds, and any flight hazards encountered.
Usually, these reports are generated during international, over-the-water flights.

                        METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITES AND IMAGERY

4.1. Meteorological Satellites (METSAT). The types of meteorological satellites are the polar orbiter
and the geostationary (equator) orbiter. Polar orbiters circle the earth crossing each pole with an orbit
height near 1,000 NM. Each completes passes over same point every 12-hours. As the earth rotates below,
the satellite completes one photo strip, which can be stitched together to form a composite photo. Thus,
the user often sees a zig-zag pattern in the photo. Geostationary satellites are located approximately
22,300 NM above the Earth with an orbit timed with the rotation of the Earth keeping it fixed over the
same point. This characteristic allows imagery sequencing by time to provide an animation of the imagery
(or loop). METSAT imagery analysis may reveal many atmospheric phenomena: cloud top heights, thun-
derstorms, turbulence, jet stream, fog, and terrain features. Although satellite imagery is a common
resource used for preflight planning, many variables can cause misinterpretation of photo features. An in
depth interpretation instruction is beyond this handbook’s scope. You must consult trained technicians to
receive a reliable analysis.

4.2. Imagery Types. The types of satellite imagery used are visible, infrared, multi-spectral, microwave
imagery, and water vapor.
     4.2.1. Visible Satellite Imagery. Visible satellite sensors scan visible light within the same range as
     the human eye. Thus, visible imagery is the same as a photograph (Figure 4.1.).
     4.2.2. Infrared Satellite Imagery (IR). Infrared sensors detect radiation dependent upon the temper-
     ature of the emitting object. Think of infrared satellite data as a picture of contrasting temperatures
     (Figure 4.2.). Standard infrared pictures show coldest temperatures as white (such as cirrus cloud
     tops) and warmest (such as land and water) as black. Each gray shade is a temperature range. Some
     imagery may be color enhanced (Figure 4.5.). Small temperature differentials between over-lapping
     elements make analysis difficult (i.e. warm stratus cloud tops and fog over warm land/water, or cold
     stratus clouds over snow-covered terrain).
     4.2.3. Multi-spectral Imagery (MSI). MSI combines Visual and IR into a color enhanced 3-dimen-
     sional image (Figure 4.3.) used to discriminate between low-mid and high-level clouds, and fog.
     4.2.4. Microwave Imagery (MI). MI is used to see through cirrus to detect lower clouds, calculate
     ocean surface winds, rain rates, snow coverage/depth and soil moisture. MI can produce radar-like
     images of weather systems, such as severe storms and hurricanes (Figure 4.4.).
     4.2.5. Water Vapor Imagery (WV). WV is sensitive to water vapor and detects radiation dependent
     upon the temperature of the emitting object (Figure 4.6.). WV can detect moisture movement into (or
     out) of a region well before clouds form, and moderate to heavy turbulence and icing.

                          GROUND WEATHER RADAR AND PRODUCTS

5.1. Ground Weather Radars. Conventional and Doppler radars are used for weather detection. Con-
ventional radars produce reflectivity products. Doppler radars (a.k.a. Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD))
produce reflectivity and velocity products. Multiple web sources provide radar data, but your primary
source should be your CWT or OWS for data and interpretation.
     5.1.1. Availability. Radar coverage is very limited OCONUS. Contact your CWT to find radar avail-
     ability for operations. NEXRAD provides near blanket coverage in CONUS. Only a few OCONUS
     NEXRADs exist. NEXRAD capable stations are listed in the en route supplements. Stations with a
     Pilot to Metro Service Voice (PMSV) and radar collocated can provide real time reports to aircrews.
     Technicians can advise you of location, movement, and intensity but cannot vector aircraft.

5.2. Product Display. Product displays will vary depending on radar type and data processing source.
Individual radars use an azimuthal color display, usually with a small area map (248 nm maximum
radius). The center is usually the radar location. Displays will differ for 32, 128, or 248 nm ranges as the
range markers and relative echo location will be closer or further from the center. Multiple radar compos-
ite displays combine data from large area to provide a big picture look. These combine data onto large
area maps (i.e. CONUS). Single and multiple radar products will use the same background to display a
variety of information. It is crucial to read the Product Legend to identify data displayed.

5.3. Reflectivity Products. Reflectivity products from both radars types are analogous. The two main
categories of reflectivity products are the base and the composite product.
     5.3.1. Base Reflectivity. Base Reflectivity depicts echoes (objects illuminated by the radar beam)
     from a single scan (Figure 5.1.). Echo strength is measured in decibels (DBZ). Products may group
     DBZs into 1-6 VIP levels or even converted to rainfall rates. The Product Legend color bar indicates
     the associated strength levels. Stronger levels farther down the scale should be avoided. Radars can
     display an image using different elevation angles, which effects presentation. Each elevation angle
     provides a different view of the echo. Greater angles give higher views but have decreased horizontal
     sensing range. Reflectivity time-lapse loops are excellent tools for determining storm movement and
     intensity changes.
     5.3.2. Composite Reflectivity. A single radar Composite Reflectivity product (Figure 5.2.) is pro-
     duced from data collected from all elevation scans and depicts the maximum reflectivity (highest
     DBZ) over any given point. The Base and Composite Reflectivity imagery have similar appearances
     (See Figure 5.1. and Figure 5.2., from the same radar during the same time). Multiple radar displays
     use single radar composite reflectivity information to build large-scale area images. The largest value
     over a point scanned by at least two radars is displayed. Figure 5.3. shows multiple radar composite
     displays from conventional (data is converted to rainfall rates) and Doppler (radar composite reflec-
     tivity data is converted and grouped into 1-6 VIP levels) radars.

   5.3.3. Radar Summary Data . Radar data may be displayed with composite images or as a graphic
   chart (Figure 5.3.). Data may include movement, intensity, tops of echoes (precipitation), or other sig-
   nificant data. Arrows depict movement with associated speed in knots. DBZs or VIPs depict intensity.
   For some graphics, contour shaded areas depict intensity (See Figure 5.4. for interpretation). Radar
   determined echo tops and bases are included when available, but actual cloud tops may be higher.
   Other significant data includes precipitation type, severe weather data, and descriptive symbols (Fig-
   ure 5.5.).

Figure 5.5. Radar Summary Data Symbols.




5.4. Velocity Products. Velocity products are only available from a Doppler radar, thus, these are limited
OCONUS. Base Velocity (Figure 5.6.) can provide wind location and speed, windshear, and microburst
activity. These depict negative values as inbound winds and positive values as outbound winds relative to
the radar. Match Product Legend colors and associated numerical value to find speed. Velocity Azimuth
Display (VAD) Wind Profile (Figure 5.7.) depicts a time-lapse image of the vertical wind profile at the
radar site. Winds are shown in 1,000 ft MSL increments. Wind speed and direction at any given level are
depicted by the standard arrow and barb format (See Figure 2.5.). The color of the wind barb is a measure
of data reliability based on the Route Mean Square (RMS) derived during data processing. The lower the
RMS, the more reliable the data. RMS values greater than 16 are not displayed and depicted by a ND.
Note: ND does not mean winds are not present at a given level.

5.5. Severe Weather Signatures. Radars can identify several severe weather signatures. Some examples
are: hail (reflectivity values over 55 DBZ), squall lines, or microbursts.

   5.5.1. Squall Line. Squall lines (Figure 5.8.) are identified by a line of high reflectivities.

Figure 5.8. Squall Line.




   5.5.2. Microbursts. Microbursts are short in duration and small in size relative to thunderstorm com-
   plexes, but they may have 100 kts of wind and severe downdrafts which can greatly impact takeoffs
   and landings. Microbursts are best detected by velocity products (Figure 5.9.). Due to the shallow
   vertical extent, microbursts are seen at low levels and usually not detected beyond 20 nm from the
   radar. Microbursts are seen as a matched strong flow to and from the radar.
58                                                                       AFH11-203V2 16 MAY 2002

5.6. Non-Precipitation Phenomenon. Radar sensitivity allows technicians to see non-precipitation ech-
oes such as birds and insects, solar effects, and smoke plumes. Always verify the data viewed with a cer-
tified weather technician.

                               LIGHTNING DETECTION PRODUCTS

6.1. Lightning Detection Products . Lightning detection products are available for CONUS (Figure
6.1.), but may be limited for OCONUS (Figure 6.3.) operations. These products provide an indication of
thunderstorms that have recently discharged lightning, but are not the only data to identify thunderstorms.
They should be used in conjunction with other data.
   6.1.1. Display Animations And Colors. Lightning product animations present a movie of lighting
   strikes over a region. Always double-check the legend for increment of time used. Some use
   color-codes vice animation. For example, NWS (Figure 6.1.) presents 30-minutes of strike data
   grouped into 6-minute groups, for five groupings from oldest to newest. Colors range from green (old-
   est strike occurrence) to red (latest strike occurrence). It also differentiates ground-to-cloud strikes
   using colored circles and cloud-to-ground strikes using hatches (Figure 6.2.). Technology is not yet
   available for cloud-to-cloud discharges. Figure 6.3. uses Red to Gray color codes for time, but does
   not distinguish strike type.

                                          SPECIAL SUPPORT PRODUCTS

7.1. Special Support Product Types . Weather technicians can provide a broad variety of special sup-
port products. Products used for any given mission depend on the aircraft type and mission profile.
Low-level tactical airlift missions require different products than fighter missions using precision-guided
munitions (PGMs) to strike a target. Examples of special support products are: Space Support, Tactical
Decision Aids (TDAs), Volcano eruptions, Computer Flight Plans (CFPs), blowing dust imagery, and
snow coverage/depth. Space Support (including Solar and Lunar data) and Volcano products can be found
on OWS or AFWA web pages. CFPs can be requested by following your MAJCOM’s directives. TDAs
are usually classified and may be available over the secure web. CWTs can provide an in-depth orienta-
tion to the specific special support products used for your wing’s mission and how to acquire them.

7.2. Space Support. AFWA produces multiple text and graphic Space Support products. A complete list
is available on the AFWA web page. AFMAN 15-135, Combat Weather Team Operations, includes
detailed information on space weather effects. Space Support products are for the region from the upper
atmosphere to the Sun. Most important to the aircrew will be the space effects on the Ionosphere. These
can impact radio, Global Positioning Satellite (GPS), and missile warning operations (Figure 7.1.).

   7.2.1. Space Weather Warnings. AFWA Space Operations Center prepares many alerts, warnings
   and advisories (Figure 7.2.) that are used to provide resource protection for valuable satellite assets.
   OWSs or CWTs do not have the capability to produce these products, but can assist with product inter-
   pretation.

      7.2.3. Space Graphic Products. Space graphic products provide global visual depictions of the
      space impacts on operations. Graphics include analysis and forecast of the effects on UHF (Figure
      1.2.), HF, and high altitude operations (Figure 7.4.). Space products can be used to make aircrews
      aware of potential impacts to communications or GPS. Furthermore, space products can be tailored to
      a specific operation.

Figure 7.4. Space Impacts.




7.3. Tactical Decision Aids (TDAs). CWTs and occasionally OWSs use TDAs to translate weather
parameters into mission impact descriptions (e.g., stoplight charts or go/no go charts), or compute weapon
system acquisition and lock on ranges, illumination levels, and temperature contrasts between the target
and background. TDAs range from simple look-up tables and graphs to complex software programs. Air-
crews and Intelligence interface with the CWT is essential to obtain the necessary mission and target data
required to generate TDAs. TDAs may be used in mission planning to assist weapon system choice based
on weather impacts and/or as part of the Army’s Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB) process
to gain situational awareness of the battlefield. TDA output is often classified because it discloses details
of the mission or performance of the weapon system. TDAs used by CWTs and other weather units are
discussed in paragraphs 7.3.1. - 7.3.4.
   7.3.1. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Operations Weather Software (NOWS). N O WS cal cu l at es
   sunrise/set, moonrise/set, and illumination levels for NVG operations. NOWS includes atmo-
   sphere-induced effects on illumination. It offers decision aids tailored for routes and areas.
   7.3.2. Target Acquisition Weather Software (TAWS). TAWS computes detection and lock-on
   ranges for various PGMs and temperature contrasts between the target and background. TAWS is used
   to provide target acquisition information for operations employing infrared and television (IR/TV)
   weapons systems.

     7.3.3. Infrared Target/Scene Simulation Software (IRTSS). This is the full-physics TDA capabil-
     ity, including scene rendering and fly-throughs. Weather strategic centers and OWSs will provide
     IRTSS support to CWTs for mission planning and execution purposes upon request.
     7.3.4. Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid (IWEDA). This is a rule-based application to pro-
     vide critical friendly and threat weapon systems performance impacts (both positive and negative)
     required for Army (and some Air Force) mission planning and execution.

7.4. Volcanic Eruption Alerts. The effects from a volcanic eruption can greatly impact operations and
damage aircraft. Volcano eruption data is available on AFWA and OWS web pages. The data may be text
(Figure 7.5.), animated graphics (Figure 7.6.) or 8-panel (Figure 7.7.).

                                        WEATHER BRIEFINGS

8.1. Weather Briefings. Weather briefings are a three-phase process including the planning, mission
execution, and post-mission debrief. Your CWT is the primary point of contact for briefings and all oper-
ational weather support. If you are not at home base, your CWT should have arranged support with
another CWT or OWS. OWSs will support transient aircrews or aircrews without CWT support. Briefings
are obtained in-person, via telephone, or on-line depending on the situation. Always obtain a mental pic-
ture of the weather. Ask yourself, How will weather affect my flight? Understanding weather’s opera-
tional impacts is essential to mission success, especially if emergency actions are required. Spend the time
needed to gather data, especially when adverse weather is a factor. Extra time spent with the CWT, the
OWS, or MAJCOM-approved web sites, forming a mental picture of the weather could be vital to a suc-
cessful mission. Never hesitate to ask about any item you believe needs clarification.
   8.1.1. Web-based Aircrew Briefing Terminals. Web-based programs utilizing Program Generation
   Scheduler/Server (PGSS) capabilities provide flight weather data. This program is intended for DoD
   aviator use. It is not intended to replace the weather person. Aircrews using this program should call a
   weather facility to obtain additional information, clarify the products, or to ask questions. Briefing ter-
   minals provide the standard weather alphanumeric, graphics, satellite, and radar information. This
   includes airfield observations, forecasts, winds, weather hazards, pilot reports, and current weather
   warnings. CWTs and OWSs provide access information and procedures to supported units. CWTs
   include information on how to access and use web-based PGSS systems in the Instrument Refresher
   Course (IRC) and can provide additional training to local customers upon request.

8.2. Requesting Weather Briefings. A unit flight scheduler will usually notify the CWT of all planned
flights. If your flight is not scheduled with the CWT, provide upcoming flight notification by website,
phone, or other locally established procedures. Transient or aircrews without CWT support should request
OWS support on-line or by phone if web access is not available. OWSs need a minimum of two hours
notification to prepare a weather briefing. You should never leave your home base without knowing
whom to contact for weather support and updates while in transient status. Military weather briefing facil-
ities and phone numbers are listed in the back of the IFR supplement and are available at the CWT. When
requesting a briefing be prepared to provide as much information as possible. At a minimum include:


A. Your name (Always identify yourself as a crew member)
B. Aircraft identification/type
C. Enroute plan (stops, low levels, landing zones, targets, ranges, etc)
D. Proposed altitude
E. Estimated time of departure/return
F. Time enroute to destination
G. Alternates required
70                                                                        AFH11-203V2 16 MAY 2002


8.3. Mission Planning Forecast (MPF). Whenever possible, you should request a Mission Planning
Forecast (MPF). Ideally the MPF request is made a minimum of 24 hours in advance. Outline mission
parameters to the CWT. This will allow the CWT to select the best weather products to support the mis-
sion and allows them to begin monitoring your specific operational areas. Furthermore, this process
allows the CWT to efficiently prepare your actual mission briefing, the Mission Execution Forecast
(MEF). The MPF will contain a general synopsis of take-off, enroute profile (targets, landing zones, etc.)
and recovery phases. MPF results may directly effect your final mission profile decisions (types of PGMs,
refueling altitudes, etc.) including the go/no-go decision. Once your final mission parameters are set
based on the MPF, you will order a MEF.

8.4. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF). CWTs prepare and brief MEFs to aircrews and the Supervisor
of Flying (SOF). DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing, is the standard MEF tool, but the MEF may
take other forms. MEFs can be stand-alone flimsies for local flying, a customized weather depiction for a
specific mission (e.g., ARs, DZs, Low-levels), customer-specific visualizations, etc. CWTs use TAFs as
general guidance for MEF takeoff, landing, and alternate airfield information. The MEF takes into
account takeoff and landing weather thresholds for specific aircraft, pilot category or mission. CWTs use
OWS-generated Military Operating Area Forecasts (MOAFs) to help create mission-specific (refueling,
drop/landing zone, etc.) MEFs coordinate MEF production times, delivery method, etc., with your local
CWT.
     8.4.1. MEF Content. Mission parameters, the weather situation, and published Air Force guidance
     drive MEF content. Figure 8.1. and Figure 8.2. show typical items covered in a MEF.

                                  AVIATION WEATHER SERVICES

9.1. Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS). Most high-density military and civil airfields
broadcast recorded weather for takeoff, approach, and landing on ATIS. Terminal IAPs, enroute charts
and the Enroute Supplement list radio frequencies.

9.2. Pilot-to-Metro Service Voice (PMSV). Use PMSV to update latest weather. The FIH has PMSV
facility locations, frequencies, and instructions. CWTs will support all PMSV contacts. CWTs monitoring
common frequencies may respond if an aircrew is not answered by their CWT or OWS after two calls.
OWSs provide support when a CWT is off-duty or unable to respond. OWS will support aircrews unable
to contact their home station CWT or another OWS. Only qualified personnel will respond. Trainees may
respond with proper supervision. Individuals not qualified to make forecasts will identify themselves as a
weather apprentice, and may only relay data. If a forecast or forecast interpretation is required and a qual-
ified technician is unavailable, the apprentice will refer you to the nearest forecasting service facillity.
Weather personnel will not vector aircraft.

9.3. Flight Service Station (FSS). The FSS functions as a weather service and ATC facility. FSS facili-
ties are found in the IFR supplement or on navigation charts. The FSS provides briefings, observations
and broadcasts weather. FSS technicians can translate weather codes and graphics, but can’t make fore-
casts. At selected locations, Enroute Flight Advisory Service (EFAS or Flight Watch) is available for
non-routine weather data. FSS provide Standard, Abbreviated and Outlook Briefings. Standard Briefings
are complete and include winds aloft, departure, enroute, and destination weather. Abbreviated Briefings
are updates to a previous briefing. For an Abbreviated Briefing, be specific about the previous informa-
tion received to include the source, date and time group, so the FSS can limit the information to what you
have not received. Outlook Briefings are used for planning when departure is over six hours away.

9.4. FAA Telephone Services. The FAA maintains sources for telphone information:
   1. 1-800-WX-BRIEF. Available 24 hours a day by FSS. Local numbers are found in the Airport/
      Facility Directory (A/FD) under "FAA and NWS Telephone Numbers." Also check under U.S.
      government, Department of Transportation, FAA, or NWS.
   2. Telephone Information Briefing Service (TIBS) provides continuous, updated recordings for local
      flights.
   3. Direct User Access System (DUATS) provides data and VFR/IFR file plan capability.
76                                                               AFH11-203V2 16 MAY 2002


9.5. VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR). Certain VORs transmit weather data, PIREPs, and NOT-
AMs. Radio code "AB" indicates FAA operated VORs providing continuous recorded broadcasts.
Request weather on VHF frequency 122.1, and FSS personnel will broadcast data over the VOR.

9.6. Non-Directional Beacon (NDB). NDBs with radio code SABH or HSAW transmit transcribed con-
tinuous data (route forecasts and observations) for selected civilian airports.

Terms
Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA)—A strategic weather center at Offutt AFB NE, providing strategic
atmospheric data and strategic analysis/forecast products required by the regional Operational Weather
Squadrons and the Combat Weather Teams worldwide. AFWA provides the centralized repository for
global observations and forecasts that are data-based at AFWA and, in turn, disseminated to DoD weather
data users worldwide. In addition to global observations and forecasts collected from worldwide sources,
AFWA collects meteorological satellite data from multiple sources. Based on global analysis of available
data, AFWA creates global analysis and forecast products to meet the strategic forecast requirements of its
customers.
AIRMET—NWS in-flight weather advisories issued only to amend the area forecast concerning weather
phenomena which are of operational interest to all aircraft and potentially hazardous to aircraft having
limited capability because of lack of equipment, instrumentation, or pilot qualification. AIRMETs

concern weather of less severity than that covered by SIGMETs or convective SIGMETs.
Air Report—A pilot report made over areas where weather information is limited or nonexistent (e.g.,
over an ocean).
Amendment—Used as a message modifier when transmitting an aerodrome forecast amendment.
Combat Weather Team (CWT)—An umbrella term covering any military weather organization
providing direct operational support at the tactical level. In addition to designated weather units, (OSS
weather flights, Weather Detachments and Squadrons, ANG Weather Flights) specialized sections in an
OWS (flight briefing or contingency cell) and AFWA (Special Support Operations Branch) also operate
as CWTs.
Contour—Line drawn on a weather map connecting points of equal height.
ICAO Identifier—A specifically authorized 4-letter identifier assigned to a location and documented in
ICAO Document 7910.ICAO (used by NTFS).
Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB)–—An analytical methodology employed to reduce
uncertainties concerning the enemy, environment, and terrain for all types of operations. IPB builds an
extensive database for each potential area in which a unit may be required to operate. The database is then
analyzed in detail to determine the impact of the enemy, environment, and terrain on operations and
presents it in graphic form.
Infrared Target Scene Simulation System Software (IRTSS)—A UNIX-server, (hosted by AFWA and
the OWSs) full-physics, tactical decision aid capability that illustrates the weapons-eye (sensor’s spectral
response) view of the target area.
Isobar—Line drawn on a weather map connecting points of equal barometric pressure.
Isodrosotherm—Line drawn on a weather map connecting points of equal dew point.
Isotach—Lines drawn on a weather map connecting points of equal wind speed.
Isotherm —Line drawn on a weather map connecting points of equal temperature.
METWATCH—Monitoring aerospace weather for a route, area, or terminal and advising concerned
organizations when phenomena that could effect their operations or pose a hazard to life or property are
observed or about to occur.
Military Operating Area Forecast (MOAF)—A forecast guidance product that provides the weather or
space environmental conditions for a specific area in which military operations are occurring.
Mission Execution Forecast (MEF) — MEF is a customized weather product providing terrestrial and
space weather data and forecasts for a specific mission, or set of missions. It fully integrates aerospace
weather with the customer’s tactics, weapon systems, environmental sensitivities of equipment, and other
operational requirements.
MISSIONWATCH—The monitoring of aerospace weather for a specific mission (i.e., ground, air or
space) and informing supported agencies when unforecasted mission-limiting phenomena could effect
operations.
Notice to Airmen—A notice containing information concerning the establishment, condition, or change
in any aeronautical facility, service, procedures, or hazard, the timely knowledge of which is essential to
personnel concerned with flight operations.

Operational Weather Squadron (OWS)—An organization comprised of management, technician, and
training personnel responsible for providing regional weather support. Their mission is to produce
fine-scale tailored weather forecast products and services to customers within their area of responsibility
(AOR).
Pilot Report—A report of in-flight weather provided by an aircrew member.
Severe Thunderstorm—A thunderstorm that produces hail greater than or equal to inch diameter and/or
surface wind greater than or equal to 50 knots.
Severe Weather—Any weather condition that poses a hazard to property or life.
SIGMET -—NWS in-flight weather advisories issued concerning weather significant to the safety of all
aircraft. There are convective and non-convective SIGMETs.
Support Assistance Request (SAR)—Used to request specialized weather, space environmental, or
climatological support from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), AF Combat Climatology Center
(AFCCC), MAJCOMs, or Operational Weather Squadrons (OWS).
Weather Advisory—A special notice provided to a supported agency when an established weather
condition that could effect its operation is occurring or is expected to occur.
Weather Warning—A special notice provided to a supported agency when an established weather
condition of such intensity as to effect operations, pose a hazard to life or property, and requires protective
action, is occurring or is expected to occur.
Weather Watch—A special notice provided to supported customers that alerts them of a potential for
weather conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property for which the customer must
take protective action.
Work Chart/Composite—A representation of meteorological elements or features and their variability
in space and time. Work charts/composites supplement or refine centralized products.
