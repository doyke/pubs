1. Background: The purpose of this instruction is to establish local policy in prescribing the
procedures and methodology to use in determining the criteria for completion certificates, which
qualify to be entered into the employee system record by the Civilian Training Management
Office.

2. Procedures:

   2.1. Non-mandatory training completion certificates 10 years old or older will only be coded
   for the system record if the training is 120 hours or more in length or part of a formal training
   program. Subsequently, for training certificates 10 years or older but less than 120 hours in
   length and deemed necessary for update into the employee THA, the Employee Development
   Specialist (EDS) will coordinate with a personnel specialist and employee’s supervisor prior
   to making a determination to deny a specific training history occurrence update.
