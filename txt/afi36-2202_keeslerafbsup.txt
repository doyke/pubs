        A9.1. Inspection: An inspection of the COC is conducted prior to each use. An obstacle will
        be closed if any ONE item is checked off as a “No Go.” It will remain closed until civil engineer
        personnel can perform routine maintenance to correct the deficiency. Unless an incident occurs,
        daily opening checklist will not be maintained past the day of use. In the event of an incident,
        the checklist will be maintained until the investigation is closed. Obstacles closed due to repairs
        will be entered into the maintenance log book.
