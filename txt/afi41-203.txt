SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This publication of AFI 41-203 supersedes the previous version of AFI 41-203, dated 25 July 1994. It
updates references to AFOSH 91-8 (Formally AFOSH 127-8) and NFPA 99.

Section A—Defining the Electrical Safety Program

1. Program Purpose. The Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) is a unique environment and requires spe-
cial procedures to ensure the electrical safety of patients and staff. Each facility will establish a proactive
electrical safety program that centers around identifying potential hazards, correcting the hazard, testing
to ensure the hazard does not recur, and training personnel to identify new and existing hazards.

2. Philosophy. Unless otherwise directed in this instruction, AFI 41-201, Managing Clinical Engineer-
ing Programs, or in AFOSH 91-8, Safety: Medical Facilities, the MTF electrical safety program will
adhere to the guidance and s tandards established by NFPA 99, Health Care Facilities; NFPA 101, Life
Safety Code; and NFPA 70, National Electrical Code.

Section B—Program Operation

4. Training the Staff.
4                                                                             AFI41-203 19 JUNE 2002


    4.1. The fundamental element of the MTF electrical safety program is safe equipment operation. Only
    when the MTF staff becomes consciously aware and alert to practices which constitute "good electri-
    cal hygiene" will the hazards of electrical shock be acceptably minimized. JCAHO standards require
    safety training as part of staff orientation and annual refresher training to e nsure safe use of equip-
    ment.
    4.2. Training is the responsibility of the area supervisors and incorporates the following:
       4.2.1. Orientations. Include procedures for reporting safety hazards, points of contact for correc-
       tions, accident reporting and investigation procedures, hazards unique to their work area, and
       equipment in-service training.
       4.2.2. Equipment In-Service Training. Include safe operation and user maintenance. Each staff
       member must understand how to visually inspect equipment for potential hazards.
       4.2.3. E lectrical Safety Briefings. Include as a minimum: program changes, the results of Envi-
       ronment of Care Committee’s findings from the organizations safety program, and periodic train-
       ing in fire suppression. Additional guidance is found in NFPA 99 Chapter 7-6.5 "Qualification and
       Training of Personnel".
       4.2.4. Documentation. All training (user/operator, safety, etc.) must be appropriately documented.
    4.3. Medical Maintenance will provide electrical safety training when requested by the area supervi-
    sor. MTFs may also consult Medical Equipment Repair Centers for additional guidance in developing
    safety training programs.
    4.4. Additional training material can be found in NFPA 99, Appendix A-3-2.2.2, "Shock Prevention"
    or through other agencies and references listed in Attachment 1.

5. Extension Cords, Power Strips, Surge Protectors, and Adapters.
    5.1. The use of electrical extension cords will be minimized in patient care areas. Extension cords will
    be used only as temporary measures. The MTF’s Safety Officer must verify the need for all extension
    cords and grant approval in wr iting before they may be us ed. If extension cords are necessary, they
    will be heavy duty, three-conductor cords with hospital grade connectors and meet requirements of
    NFPA 99, Chapters 7, 9 and 12. Extension cords must be approved, as an assembly, by a Nationally
    Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) such as Underwriters’ Laboratory (UL) [Reference 29 CFR
    1910.303(a) and 29 CFR 1926.403(a)]. When an extension cord is used in patient care areas to place
    medical equipment into operation, an electrical safety inspection must be performed with the cord in
    the circuit. When an extension cord is used for the purpose of placing medical equipment into opera-
    tion for an extended period, Medical Maintenance will initiate a facility work order to have an ade-
    quate receptacle (and branch, if ne eded) installed to eliminate the need for a permanent extension
    cord. Ungrounded (two-wire) extension cords are prohibited. Metallic-bodied two or three-blade end
    connectors are also prohibited. Extension cords shall not be connected to lighting fixtures in anesthe-
    tizing locations under any circumstances [Reference NFPA 99, 12-4.1.2.5(b)]. Extension cords of any
    type are prohibited in ar eas where flammables are used or stored (see NEC Article 517 a nd Federal
    Specification W-C-596).
    5.2. Extension cords must be suitable for use, sized to support the expected load (but no smaller than
    #16 AWG) and conf orm to m anufacturer requirements for power cords and attachment plugs as
    defined in NFPA 99, Chapter 9-2.1.2.
AFI41-203 19 JUNE 2002                                                                                     5


   5.3. Three-to-two-prong adapters are prohibited per NFPA 99, Chapter 7-6.2.1.5, "Adapters and
   Extension Cords". However, BMETs may use the three-to-two-prong adapters ("cheater adapter")
   when necessary to facilitate testing and repair of medical equipment.
   5.4. Power Strips:
      5.4.1. A power strip is a UL approved conductor cord with built-in fuse or circuit breaker, multi-
      ple outlets, and with an amperage rating of 15 or less amps. Power strips will not exceed 15 feet in
      total length. The MTF Safety Officer must approve use of power strips, with non-medical equip-
      ment. Medical Maintenance must evaluate and approve power strips used with medical equip-
      ment.
      5.4.2. The maximum amperage rating of the power strip must never be less that of the appliance
      cord rating or exceed the electrical rating of the outlets.
      5.4.3. Power strips can be used to extend power from the wall outlet to power low amperage com-
      puters and office equipment.
      5.4.4. Power strips will not be plugged into another power strip or extension cord.
   5.5. A surge protector is a device with built in components to protect equipment connected to it from
   excessive energy by s horting this energy to ground. Normally, they are configured as a power strip,
   but may be configured as a single or multiple outlet adapter that plugs directly into a wall outlet. (Most
   have an indicator light identifying them as surge protectors). Surge protectors will not be connected to
   patient care equipment unless required by the manufacturer.
   5.6. At a minimum, extension cords, power strips, and surge protectors must be inspected annually by
   the Section Safety Monitor.

6. Use of Privately Owned Equipment.
   6.1. Patient Owned:
      6.1.1. Restrict use of patient-owned electrical devices to those necessary for the welfare of the
      patient and appropriate for the patient care environment.
      6.1.2. Develop local written procedures to control the use of patient-owned electrical devices in
      patient care environments. These procedures ensure:
          6.1.2.1. Visual safety inspection of the device by trained personnel. Note: Personnel perform-
          ing inspections are trained by Medical Maintenance personnel on local safety inspection pro-
          cedures.
          6.1.2.2. Approval by a medical practitioner who has established that the patient is mentally
          and physically able to use the device safely.
          6.1.2.3. Inspection and approval of the device is documented according to local policies.
   6.2. Staff Owned:
      6.2.1. S taff-owned medical electrical devices must conform to the same requirements of
      MTF-owned medical equipment and must be inspected by the BMET prior to use in the facility.
      See AFI 41-201, NFPA 99, 7-6.2.1.11, and the local Equipment Management Plan.

       6.2.2. Staff-owned nonmedical electrical devices used in patient care areas are subject to the same
       safety requirements as MTF-owned devices and should be used with discretion.
       6.2.3. Staff members file, and retain at the MTF, equipment inspection and main tenance docu-
       mentation.
    6.3. Consult Medical Maintenance personnel when the safety of a device is questionable.

Terms
Critical Care Areas—Special care un its, i ntensive care u nits, coronary c are u nits, angiography
laboratories, cardiac catheterization laboratories, delivery rooms, operating rooms, and similar areas in
AFI41-203 19 JUNE 2002                                                                                   11


which patients are subject to invasive procedures and connected to line-operated, electromedical devices.
General Care Areas—Patient bedrooms, examining rooms, treatment rooms, clinics, and similar areas
in which the patient is in contact with ordinary appliances such as nur se-call systems, electric beds,
examining lamps, telephones, and entertainment devices. (Note: In such areas, patients may be connected
to electromedical devices such as heating pads, electrocardiographs, drainage pumps, monitors,
otoscopes, ophthalmoscopes, intravenous lines, etc.).
Patient Care Area—Any portion of a health care facility wherein patients are intended to be examined or
treated. (Note: Business offices, corridors, lounges, day rooms, dining rooms, or similar areas are not
typically classified as patient care areas.)
Wet Locations—A patient care area that is "normally" subject to w et conditions while patients are
present. This includes standing fluids on the floor or drenching of the work area, either of which condition
is intimate to the patient or staff. Routine housekeeping procedures and incidental s pillage of liquids do
not define a wet location.
