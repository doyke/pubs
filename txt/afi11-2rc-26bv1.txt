SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This AFI has been substantially revised and requires a thorough review to examine all of the
changes. The major revisions are as follows:

All references to ANG/XO and XOTM have been changed to NGB/A3 and NGB/A3T,
respectfully. As the only ―MAJCOM‖ for the RC-26, NGB/A3 is the waiver authority for this
regulation unless specifically delegated to the unit OG Commanders. All references to syllabus
requirements have been removed, see tables 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 4.2 and 4.3, and are now contained
within their respective syllabi. Paragraph 2.6, Differences Training has been added and table 3.1
now references Pilot/MSO differences academics. The terms for BMC, MR, and CMR have
been added/changed to paragraph 3.1. Paragraph 4.2 now reflects the required hours needed for
different experience levels (FTL ―A‖ and ―B‖). Ground Training Requirements, now table 4.2,
has been substantially revised to include new requirements and new ARMS identifiers.
Simulator Training, now identified as GS09 is a biennial requirement. On table 4.2, the annual
training period now runs from 1 October to 30 September. Table 4.3 identifies semi-annual
flying requirements with the periods of 1 October to 31 March and 1 April to 30 September.
Table 4.4 has been added to include new requirements and new ARMS identifiers. Table 5.1
replaces the old table 6.1 and the hours requirement for upgrading crew positions has been
substantially revised. Table 5.3, FCF Academics Review, replaces the old table 6.5. Figure 5.1
from the old AFI, referencing ―lookback‖ has been removed.

     proficiency of the student should raise a question in the instructor’s mind as to the
     student’s ability to safely execute the duties of the aircrew position, the instructor will
     immediately take over these duties. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate
     the proper method of executing these duties. Instructors must be highly knowledgeable in
AFI11-2RC-26B1 8 MARCH 2012                                                                      11


       RC-26B TTPs, Technical Orders and governing AFIs to provide immediate instruction to
       any crew position concerning weapon system employment and regulatory/non-regulatory
       guidance.
       1.3.10.6. Instructor pilots are responsible at all times for the conduct of the flight and
       safety of the aircraft. At any time during the flight, if the judgment or proficiency of the
       student at the controls raises a question in the instructor pilot’s mind as to the student’s
       ability to safely complete a prescribed maneuver, the instructor pilot will immediately
       take over the controls of the aircraft. The instructor pilot should then explain and
       demonstrate proper methods of conducting the maneuver prior to the student resuming
       control of the aircraft. All instructors will place special emphasis on the procedures for
       positive identification of emergency conditions before initiating corrective action. In
       addition, instructors will place a high emphasis on the procedures for positive exchange
       of control; these procedures will be thoroughly briefed.
       1.3.10.7. Instructors who demonstrate deficiencies in their ability to instruct may be used
       in their primary crew position (provided the deficiency does not involve primary crew
       duties). Commanders will take the necessary action to either retrain or remove those
       individuals from instructor status IAW AFI 11-202 V2.
       1.3.10.8. Individuals designated for instructor duty are authorized to instruct at all levels
       of qualification. Instructors are authorized to teach any event in which they are qualified
       and current unless specifically restricted.
   1.3.11. Individual Aircrew Member Responsibilities.
       1.3.11.1. Upon permanent change of station (PCS), hand carry career training folder and
       any other available training records to assist the gaining unit in assessing qualifications
       and training requirements.
       1.3.11.2. When attending a formal school course, hand carry a copy of aircrew flight
       records products set forth in the FTU Student Guide to the training unit aviation resource
       management office. When attending simulator training, provide a copy of their orders to

       home station.
       1.3.11.3. Complete training requirements and currencies within the guidelines of this
       instruction.
       1.3.11.4. Participate only in ground and flying activities for which they are qualified,
       current and adequately prepared.
1.4. Aircrew Training Policy. The primary training method for RC-26B initial qualification,
requalification, or upgrade training is attendance at a formal school. USAF policy dictates the
use of formal schools unless attendance is impractical. The secondary method is in-unit training,
using applicable formal school courseware. Secondary method training (SMT) requires a waiver
be submitted through the OG/CC and approved by NGB/A3T. Any aircrew member who was
previously dis-enrolled from a formal course for substandard performance is ineligible for a
secondary method training waiver. When specific formal courseware is not published, use of
locally developed training plans may be authorized. Units will forward all locally developed
training plans for in-unit training to NGB/A3T for review and approval.
12                                                         AFI11-2RC-26B1 8 MARCH 2012


  1.4.1. In-unit training for mission qualification and instructor upgrades are discouraged and
  waivers shall be rarely granted. In-unit upgrades to instructor must complete a formal school
  instructor certification prior to instructing at the FTU. Students who complete in-unit training
  for initial qualification are expected to complete mission qualification at the FTU at the first
  practical course date.
  1.4.2. Secondary Method Training (SMT). Aircrew members (primary or supervisory) must
  complete secondary method training within 180 days from the date of their first ground
  training session or first flight, whichever occurs first. Students will start training within 45
  days of waiver approval. Individuals unable to complete training within these limits may
  continue training; however, their units will notify NGB/A3T with a description of the
  difficulty and expected completion date (not to exceed an additional 120 days). If SMT is not
  completed by this date, any further extension requires NGB/A3T approval. Commanders will
  ensure aircrew personnel engaged in qualification or requalification training complete their
  training in a timely and uninterrupted manner. Duties not directly related to qualification or
  requalification training should be minimized.
     1.4.2.1. Formal School courseware requests. For SMT, the waiver authority will include
     the appropriate formal school as an addressee on all correspondence and will request that
     the formal school forward applicable courseware to the aircrew member’s unit of
     assignment. Courseware includes but is not limited to; the course syllabus, briefings,
     Computer Based Training (CBT) modules, student and instructor guides, and training
     guides and grade sheets for the student’s training folder. The unit training office will
     verify the current version is used.
     1.4.2.2. Complete all academic, ground, and flight training outlined in the syllabus.
     When the courseware is adapted for local use, modify it only if the training is
     incompatible with local training conditions (e.g. simulator/training device not available).
     1.4.2.3. NGB approved differences training may be conducted in-unit without a waiver
     (see Chapter 2 and Chapter 3).
     1.4.2.4. Units conducting training (i.e. to complete training for restricted AF Form 8,
     Certificate of Aircrew Qualification or NGB approved differences training) will send a
     request for any applicable courseware through channels to NGB/A3T, with an
     information copy to the appropriate formal school. Include unit point of contact (name,
     rank, office symbol, and telephone number) and the name and rank of the individual who
     will receive the training.
  1.4.3. Training Forms. Aircrew training records and forms will be established and
  maintained per Chapter 6 of this instruction.
     1.4.3.1. AF IMT 1381 may be used to provide a permanent source for aircrew
     certifications not attained through AF Form 8/8a qualification. AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
     Aircrew Training.
     1.4.3.2. For formal school training, prepare training records in accordance with AFI11-
     202 guidance. For in-unit use of formal school courseware, use the appropriate training
     record and forms pertaining to the respective formal course. These forms will contain
     tasks, subtasks, training profiles, and minimum proficiency levels.
AFI11-2RC-26B1 8 MARCH 2012                                                                       13


   1.4.4. Aircrew Training While DNIF. Crewmembers whose status is ―duty not involving
   flying‖ (DNIF) may log ground training events, including simulator training, if the member’s
   physical condition allows. Consult the flight surgeon initiating AF IMT 1042, Medical
   Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty, action if the DNIF status includes
   ground training limitations.
   1.4.5. In-flight Supervision. Unless specifically directed, the unit commander determines the
   level of supervision necessary to accomplish required training. If the mission objectives
   include introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, then an
   instructor may be required. The following personnel must be supervised by an instructor
   from a like crew position when performing aircrew duties:
       1.4.5.1. Non-current crewmembers. EXCEPTION: Cross crew position training is
       authorized IAW paragraph 1.4.6
       1.4.5.2. Crewmembers in initial, difference, upgrade or requalification flying training.
       1.4.5.3. Senior officers who have not completed initial qualification as outlined in
       Chapter 2 and as outlined in paragraph 1.7
   1.4.6. Cross Crew Position Training (CCPT). With unit commander, operations officer, or
   mission commander approval, instructors from one crew position may train crewmembers
   from a different crew position on specific skills/events in which both are qualified (as long as
   the instructor is not performing duties as a primary crewmember at the time) unless otherwise
   restricted in this volume. Examples include RC-26B Mission System Specialist (MSO)
   instructing a CP in Secure Communication/loading COMSEC or an RC-26B Pilot instructing
   a MSO on instructor techniques. See Paragraph 4.4.2.1
1.5. Service Commitments. Formal training, either primary or secondary method, conducted
per this instruction may incur a service commitment IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service
Commitments (ADSC) or Air National Guard Instruction, ANGI 36-2101, Assignments within the
Air National Guard. Reference the appropriate AFI for program specifics. Individuals will
acknowledge the incurred SC by signing the appropriate Service Commitment
Acknowledgement Statement, prior to entering training. The unit training officer will notify
AFPC/DPSFO via the servicing MPF once training is complete.
1.6. Waivers. Waiver authority for this publication is the MAJCOM, NGB/A3, IAW AFI 11-
202 Vol 1. Waivers will be requested from the parent MAJCOM through appropriate channels.
Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the supplement and approved
through the higher level coordination authority.
   1.6.1. Group commanders are the waiver authority for individual, case-by-case flying hour
   requirements and for ground and flying training requirements as outlined below:
       1.6.1.1. Extend ground training requirement due dates up to 6 months for Note 1 items in
       Table 4.2 on an individual basis only (EXCEPTION: Items referenced in paragraph 1.6
       levied by other AFIs may not be waived by the OG unless specifically authorized to do so
       in the source AFI). These events may count towards the next periodic requirements (units
       should note on waiver when events were accomplished and the ARMS due date should be
       updated).
 14                                                          AFI11-2RC-26B1 8 MARCH 2012


       1.6.1.2. Extend due dates for the duration of an exercise, contingency or operational
       mission for Table 4.2 events on an individual basis only if a crewmember goes overdue
       while away from home station and the training is not available at the deployed location
       (EXCEPTION: Items referenced in paragraph 1.6 levied by other AFIs may not be
       waived by the OG unless specifically authorized to do so in the source AFI).
       1.6.1.3. Waive all flying training requirements (Table 4.3 and Table 4.4 except as
       otherwise noted) on an individual basis only. Wings/groups must keep an accurate record
       of waivers granted. Notify NGB/A3T at the end of the annual training period when
       waivers are issued for failure to meet required annual training.
1.7. Senior Officer Flying/Supervisory Aircrew. See AFI 11-202 Vol 1, as supplemented.
   1.7.1. All formal training courses for senior officers (Colonel-selects and above or OG/CCs
   and above) should be conducted at the FTU. If circumstances preclude training at the FTU,
   senior officers may be trained locally with a waiver from NGB/A3T.
   1.7.2. Senior officers must meet course entry prerequisites and will complete all syllabus
   requirements unless waived IAW syllabus directives.
   1.7.3. If senior officers are trained at the unit to which they are assigned, they will be in
   formal training status. The majority of unit duties should be turned over to appropriate
   deputies or vice commanders until training is completed.
1.8. Inter-Unit Transfer of Aircrews. For inter-unit transfer of aircrew members, the gaining
organization will honor validated training completed by newly assigned crewmembers prior to
the transfer. For transfers, certifications and qualifications should be accepted to the maximum
extent practical, as long as training and evaluation standards are equivalent. The commander or
designated representative at the gaining unit should review the individual's career training folder
and flight evaluation folder to determine which certifications and qualifications will be honored.
Aircrew members qualified in the same MDS are considered qualified in that equipment
throughout the force when used for the same mission.
   1.8.1. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Screening. Losing units will screen individual
   flight and ground training records during unit out-processing. Accomplish this screening in
   sufficient time to correct discrepancies prior to PCS. Losing unit will provide a printed copy
   of current ground and flying training summaries to individuals prior to PCS. See AFI 11-401,
   Aviation Management, for additional guidance.
   1.8.2. Instructor training and qualifications may be accepted at the discretion of the gaining
   unit.
1.9. Initial Cadre for Change of Aircraft, Equipment, or Capability. When possible,
qualified personnel in other units operating like equipment will provide the initial cadre. In some
instances, it will be necessary for units converting from one design aircraft to another to form an
initial cadre of aircrew personnel for whom certain training qualification requirements may be
waived. Authorization to form initial cadre crews will be contained in the conversion program
action directive. Unless otherwise stated in the program action directive, the following conditions
will apply to management of initial cadre aircrew qualification for aircraft conversion:
AFI11-2RC-26B1 8 MARCH 2012                                                                       15


   1.9.1. A nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) will be formed to
   begin aircrew training. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than
   currently held. For example, HC-130P IP to HC-130J flight examiner.
   1.9.2. Units send proposed initial cadre list by name, rank, current crew position and aircraft,
   total flying time, and requested crew qualification level through channels to NGB/A3T for
   approval.
       1.9.2.1. Following final approval, publish a unit letter to identify initial cadre instructors
       and flight examiners by aircraft and crew qualification and file in each cadre individual’s
       FEF (Tab 2).
       1.9.2.2. If a checkride was accomplished, enter appropriate comments in the remarks
       section of AF Form 8 explaining the individual’s status as initial cadre instructor or flight
       examiner.
   1.9.3. Initial cadre are not required for minor aircraft modifications when any required
   training for that modification is provided by the contractor and/or can easily be accomplished
   in-unit. Conduct differences training for the new equipment and log training on a letter of Xs
   or Memo for Record (MFR). Crewmembers will not fly with new equipment until trained.
1.10. Unit Aircrew Capability. Units will maintain mission ready status on all primary aircrew
members up to unit authorizations. Commanders or a designated representative will train
aircrews to meet capabilities specified in unit DOC statements. Supervisory aircrew and staff
members assigned above unit level, which are in excess of the unit’s mission requirements, will
maintain a status IAW paragraphs 2.6 and 3.1, either BAQ, BMC, MR, or CMR as required.
Note: To change from BMC to MR/CMR status, a crewmember will begin maintaining full
MR/CMR flying currency. The unit commander, or designated representative, may assign
additional training, as desired.
   1.10.1. Commanders or a designated representative should not assign additional duties to
   first assignment crewmembers (directly out of formal MDS training) for their first 6 months
   in the unit. This policy allows pipeline students to learn the weapon system without
   distraction of an additional duty; however, first assignment senior personnel may be assigned
   additional duties.
1.11. Changes. NGB/A3T is the approval authority for changes or revisions to this instruction.
   1.11.1. Due to dynamic requirements of Combatant Commanders, training requirements and
   currencies may be altered regularly. These training requirement and currency adjustments
   should be coordinated through NGB/A3T and implemented via Memorandums.

                                            Chapter 2

                                QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. Overview. This chapter outlines the minimum requirements for Basic Aircraft
Qualification (BAQ) training which may be completed via initial qualification, requalification,
conversion, or differences training. Duties not directly related to qualification or requalification
training should be minimized.
2.2. General Requirements. The primary method of initial qualification and requalification
training is the appropriate formal training course. If no requalification course exists, conduct
requalification using the initial qualification course.
   2.2.1. Pilots will complete CP-IQT in the right seat and receive a copilot (CP) evaluation
   unless they have been previously qualified as a multi-place aircraft commander/fighter flight
   lead in any MDS or they have a minimum of 1000 hours flying time in turbine powered,
   fixed-wing aircraft.
       2.2.1.1. Commanders may direct CP training regardless of previous experience or
       qualification.
   2.2.2. Prior to beginning flight training, student pilots will complete initial simulator
   training.
   2.2.3. Prior to beginning flight training, student pilots and MSOs will complete
   Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM) training, either at the respective undergraduate
   school, or in a prior MDS. RC-26 specific CRM training will be accomplished within 6
   months of completion at the FTU.
   2.2.4. Once qualified, crewmembers may credit BAQ events in Chapter 4.
   2.2.5. BAQ allows crewmembers to fly without instructor supervision on non-mission
   sorties. Note: General officer commanders maintaining BAQ must fly with an instructor
   IAW AFI11-202V1.
   2.2.6. Crewmembers who maintain BAQ status will complete the same ground training
   events as BMC aircrew.
   2.2.7. Mission Systems Officers (MSO) must have completed Air Force Undergraduate
   Navigator/Combat System Officer (CSO)/Air Battle Management (ABM) Training or
   equivalent prior to entry into the program. ABMs must have previous flying experience as
   an ABM in a different MDS.
2.3. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate formal course
syllabus, AFI 11-202 Vol. 1, and this instruction. The formal school Syllabus of Instruction
(SOI) designates the course prerequisite approval authority.
2.4. Ground Training Requirements. All crewmembers must complete or be current on
ground training requirements IAW Table 2.1, prior to the first flight. See Chapter 4 for event
descriptions.

   2.4.1. Written Examinations. Open and closed book qualification examinations must be
   completed before the completion of basic qualification flying training. Written examinations
   must satisfy the requirements of AFI 11-202, Vol. 2 and MDS Vol. 2. The formal school
   will not forward their examinations as part of the courseware for in-unit qualifications.
   When qualification training is completed by secondary method, the student will complete the
   appropriate group Stan/Eval or equivalent examination IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 2, paragraph
   5.5.1. IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 2, paragraph 5.5.3, all requisites must be completed within the
   6-month eligibility period prior to/encompassing the scheduled flight evaluation.
2.5. Flying Training Requirements. Satisfactorily completing the appropriate formal course
satisfies the requirements of this section. Approved in-unit qualification training must be
accomplished IAW applicable formal school courseware and the guidance below:
   2.5.1. Flying training lessons should be completed sequentially. If mission scheduling or
   student progress dictates otherwise, in-unit training sequences may be changed by the RC-
   26B Operations Officer or equivalent.
2.6. Basic Aircraft Qualification Conversion/Differences Training. Conversion training is
normally associated with training between MDS (e.g. MC-12 to RC-26). Difference training is
conducted when training in a different series aircraft in the same mission design (e.g. RC-26
Block 20 to 25).
   2.6.1. Conversion Training. Unit conversions follow the appropriate formal course syllabus
   or accomplish in-unit training IAW paragraph 1.4 and AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
   2.6.2. Difference training is required when being certified in an aircraft which is a different
   series, but the same mission design and the amount of training needed for qualification does
   not warrant attendance at a formal qualification course. Additionally, accomplish difference
   training when an aircraft is modified and any required training for that modification can
   easily be accomplished in-unit. BAQ difference training qualifies an aircrew member to
18                                                       AFI11-2RC-26B1 8 MARCH 2012


  perform aircrew duties in the aircraft. Primary method for differences training is via
  completion of Type 1 training from a contractor, or contractor-trained instructor authorized
  to subsequently conduct the training at the formal school or home-station IAW an NGB/A3T
  approved AF IMT 4024, satisfactory completion of the qualification written open/closed
  examinations, and instructor certification on the AF IMT 4348 USAF Aircrew Certifications
  or AF IMT 1381 USAF Certification of Aircrew Training for the new aircraft. Aircrew
  members entered into differences training will complete training within 180 days after the
  first flight of the training program.
AFI11-2RC-26B1 8 MARCH 2012                                                                      19


                                            Chapter 3

                      MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT)

3.1. Overview. This chapter establishes the minimum training requirements for completing
mission qualification, requalification, and differences training. Upon completion of mission
qualification training, the crewmember will be assigned either Basic Mission Capable (BMC),
Mission Ready (MR) or Combat Mission Ready (CMR) status.
   3.1.1. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
   completed mission qualification training, is qualified in some aspect of the unit mission, but
   does not maintain MR/CMR status. The aircrew member must be able to attain full
   qualification to meet operational taskings within 30 days.
   3.1.2. Mission Ready (MR). An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed mission
   qualification training and maintains qualification and proficiency in the unit operational
   mission.
   3.1.3. Combat Mission Ready (CMR). An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
   completed mission qualification training and maintains qualification and proficiency in the
   command combat mission.
3.2. General Requirements. The primary method of mission qualification or requalification is
to complete the appropriate formal training course. Completing the appropriate formal course
satisfies the training requirements of this chapter. If no requalification course exists, conduct
requalification using the initial mission qualification course. When attendance is not practical
(i.e. senior leadership training) or quotas are not available for an extended period of time, units
may request waivers to conduct secondary method mission qualification training IAW paragraph
1.4.1 using formal school courseware to attain BMC or MR status. Any aircrew member who has
previously failed to successfully complete the formal course for substandard performance will
not be issued a SMT waiver. This courseware establishes the minimum training requirements to
meet standards specified in AFI 11-2RC-26B Vol 2. Units may supplement formal courseware to
meet local requirements. Submit all SMT courseware change requests to NGB/A3T prior to
implementation.
3.3. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate formal course
syllabus, the Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA), AFI 11-202 Vol 1, and
this instruction. The formal school syllabus designates the course prerequisite approval authority.
   3.3.1. Simultaneous/Concurrent      Multiple-MDS      qualification   upgrades   will   not   be
   accomplished.
3.4. Ground Training Requirements. Complete all applicable ground training in Chapter 4
as part of mission qualification training or prior to certifying individuals as BMC, MR or CMR.
Completion of training will establish due dates for recurring ground training required in Chapter
4. Credit any training accomplished at a formal school. Qualified BMC, MR or CMR
crewmembers transferred from other units require only unit specific mission ready training
events and/or events which are due/overdue.

   3.4.1. Academic Training. Complete all academic and ground training delineated in
   applicable courseware. If not included in the course syllabus, accomplish the minimum
   requirements listed in AFI 11-202, Vol. 1 separately.
   3.4.2. Written Examination. Crewmembers must complete a written examination IAW 11-
   2RC-26B Vol 2.
3.5. Flying Training Requirements. Satisfactorily completing the appropriate formal course
satisfies the requirements of this section. Approved in-unit qualification training must be
accomplished IAW applicable formal school courseware and the guidance below:
   3.5.1. Flying training lessons should be completed sequentially. If mission scheduling or
   student progress dictates otherwise, in-unit training sequences may be changed by the unit
   operations officer.
   3.5.2. There should be minimum time lapse between training missions, and every effort
   should be made to complete mission qualification training requirements within the prescribed
   time period.
3.6. MQT Differences Training
   3.6.1. MQT Differences Training. Accomplish training locally covering aircraft and
   academic training in Table 3.1. Commanders publish an MFR directing the appropriate
   number of flights according to the needs of the trainee.

                                          Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General Requirements.
   4.1.1. Requirements in this chapter satisfy the minimum flying and related ground training to
   maintain currency. Individual proficiency may require a greater number of events. Failure to
   accomplish these continuation training (CT) requirements may not affect BMC, MR or CMR
   status but may entail additional training as determined by the commander.
   4.1.2. Training requirements may be completed on any sortie if the accrediting criteria of
   this instruction are met. Sorties and events that are compatible may be credited on the same
   flight.
   4.1.3. Aircrew members will not log continuation training requirements in events in which
   they are unqualified.
   4.1.4. Training events accomplished on an evaluation or an instructor certification may be
   credited toward the individual’s volume requirements.
   4.1.5. Flying training events accomplished during formal training will use the course
   completion date (successful evaluation date) to establish the due dates for all subsequent
   currency and requirements. Use actual dates for ground training.
   4.1.6. The annual training period ground continuation training starts on 1 October and ends
   on 30 September. The semi-annual training period for flying continuation training will be 1
   October to 31 March and 1 April to 30 September. Because the RC-26 is subject to
   worldwide tasking, every attempt should be made to balance training.
      4.1.6.1. Accomplishment of annual training events is critical to aircrew proficiency.
      Training and flying programs should be built to accomplish all training events in an even
      distribution throughout the training year. Crewmembers are required to accomplish all
      flying training events by the end of the training cycle. End-of-Cycle training
      requirements are based on the aircrew member's experience level on the last day of the
      current training cycle.
   4.1.7. Aircraft flying training requirements may be accomplished in an Aircrew Training
   Device (ATD) as noted in Table 4.3. If regaining currency in the ATD, it must be
   accomplished with a current and qualified RC-26B instructor pilot. A simulator event
   certification letter issued by NGB/A3T may permit ATD event logging in excess of Table
   4.3.
   4.1.8. Aircraft Qualification Requirements. The following are requirements for BAQ, BMC,
   MR, and CMR qualifications:
      4.1.8.1. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) Requirements.
          4.1.8.1.1. Instrument flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2RC-26BV2.
          4.1.8.1.2. Maintain currencies IAW AFI 11-202V1 and AFI 11-2RC-26BV1.
 22                                                        AFI11-2RC-26B1 8 MARCH 2012


           4.1.8.1.3. Unless currently enrolled in a program to achieve BMC, MR, or CMR
           status, BAQ crewmembers that remain in BAQ status for more than six months will
           be grounded (except senior officers). Waiver authority is NGB/A3T.
       4.1.8.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC) and Mission Ready (MR) Requirements.
           4.1.8.2.1. Instrument flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2RC-26BV2.
           4.1.8.2.2. Mission flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2RC-26BV2.
           4.1.8.2.3. Maintain currencies IAW AFI 11-202V1 and AFI 11-2RC-26BV1.
       4.1.8.3. Combat Mission Ready (CMR) Requirements.
           4.1.8.3.1. BMC/MR requirements and FTU ground and flight training requirements.
4.2. Training Levels (TL) The use of experience based Flying Training Levels (FTLs)
allows the unit commanders to prioritize training resources. Aircrew members must meet
the minimum criteria established in paragraph 4.2.1 and Table 4.1 before assignment to the
respective training level. When these minima are met, awarding a training level is at the sole
discretion of the unit commanders . NOTE: The aircrew member’s availability to fly should not
be a factor in assigning FTLs.
   4.2.1. FTLs are based on minimum RC26 time and total time. For basic and mission
   qualification FTL, RC26 time will include any variant of RC-26B.
       4.2.1.1. FTL ―A‖- Experienced BAQ, BMC, MR and/or CMR aircrew members.
       4.2.1.2. FTL ―B‖- Inexperienced BAQ, BMC, MR and/or CMR aircrew members.

        MSO           300&1000 or 500
   4.2.2. Change of FTL. Once a semiannual period begins, personnel will not be moved to a
   level requiring fewer events until the next semiannual period.
4.3. Proration of Training Requirements. See AFI 11-202 Vol 1.
4.4. Failure to Complete Training Requirements. Declare individuals Basic Mission Capable
(BMC) if they fail to maintain flying currency, fail to complete semi-annual flying continuation
training requirements or ground continuation training requirements (Table 4.2 through Table
4.4).. Training is required whenever an aircrew member does not meet a currency requirement in
this instruction. An aircrew member will not perform events unsupervised until training has been
accomplished.
   4.4.1. Loss of Currency. Failure to accomplish events listed in the continuation training
   tables (Table 4.2 through Table 4.4) results in a loss of currency for that event.
   Crewmembers are non-current the day after event currency expires. If loss of currency is less
   than 6 months the required supervision level is an instructor qualified and current in the
AFI11-2RC-26B1 8 MARCH 2012                                                                    23


   sortie or event identified. The amount of training required will be at the discretion of the
   instructor.
       4.4.1.1. Loss of currency in any Table 4.3 and Table 4.4 events results in supervised
       status until recurrent.
           4.4.1.1.1. Pilots who maintain qualification in any RC-26B block aircraft may satisfy
           Table 4.3 currency requirements in either aircraft. If basic semi-annual currency is
           lost (failure to complete the requirements of Table 4.3), it is lost for any block
           aircraft. Lost basic semi-annual currency may be regained in any block aircraft.
       4.4.1.2. Loss of currency exceeding 6-months. Crewmembers non-current in designated
       BAQ events (Table 4.3 note 3 events) in excess of six months results in loss of BAQ.
       Crewmembers non-current in designated mission events (Table 4.4 note 3 events) in
       excess of six months results in loss of mission qualification. Instructors losing currency
       in excess of 6 months in the previously mentioned events will not be able to instruct until
       the requirements of paragraph 5.3.4 are met.
   4.4.2. Regaining Currency.
       4.4.2.1. Crewmembers who fail to complete sortie or event requirements of this volume
       by the end of each semi-annual training cycle will require instructor supervision to
       accomplish the events required to regain currency.
       4.4.2.2. Only Table 4.3 Note 3 and Table 4.4 events require an evaluation (unqualified)
       if loss of currency exceeds 6 months (see AFI 11-202 Vol 1). Other Table 4.3 events
       require demonstrating proficiency to an instructor in the aircraft or ATD to regain
       currency. If loss of currency exceeds 24 months in non-note 3 events, additional training
       will consist of ground and flight training as directed by the unit commander (training
       folder must be opened).
       4.4.2.3. Aircrew non-current in special mission events which only require an instructor
       certification (Table 4.4) may regain currency by showing proficiency in that event to an
       instructor.
       4.4.2.4. To regain CMR Status aircrew members must complete OG directed ground and
       flight training to include a part task trainer and flight training
   4.4.3. Requalification Training. Crewmembers requiring requalification will accomplish
   training IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 1, applicable MAJCOM supplements, and Chapter 2,
   Chapter 3, and Chapter 5 of this instruction.
4.5. Ground Continuation Training. Table 4.2 designates ground training requirements for
all aircrew members. Conduct training IAW the referenced publications, notes in Table 4.2, and
the guidance below. The governing directive takes precedence over Chapter 4 requirements. If
the AFI 11-2RC-26B, Vol 1 is also listed as a governing directive, the most restrictive guidance
should be followed.
   4.5.1. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events. Make-up training should be
   accomplished at the earliest opportunity. The following apply when crewmembers exceed
   due dates for Table 4.2 events:
 24                                                       AFI11-2RC-26B1 8 MARCH 2012


       4.5.1.1. Grounding items. Crewmembers will not perform flight duties until the
       grounding item is satisfied.
       4.5.1.2. Supervised status items. Crewmembers will not fly without instructor
       supervision.
       4.5.1.3. Combat Mission Ready (CMR) items. Failure to accomplish CMR events in
       Table 4.2 results in Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status and the individual will not
       deploy as a crewmember.
   4.5.2. Ancillary training. This volume is not a comprehensive list of all ancillary training
   required by the DOD. Ancillary training parent instructions take precedence over this AFI
   for those training items.

documentation of training. Instructions are provided for AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training
Folder, AF IMT 4023, Aircrew Training Progress Report, AF IMT 4024, Aircrew Training
Accomplishment Report, and AF IMT 4025, Aircrew Summary/Closeout Report.
6.2. Career Training Folder. Units will maintain an aircrew training folder for all assigned or
attached crewmembers.
   6.2.1. The name of the crewmember will be clearly posted on both the binder spine and front
   cover. The front cover must also prominently display the following statement: ―PRIVACY
   ACT INFORMATION - The information accessed through this system is FOR OFFICIAL
   USE ONLY and must be protected in accordance with the Privacy Act and AFI 33-332.‖
   Each training record within the binder will be tabbed separately to differentiate between
   programs. The binder will be divided into sections as follows:
       6.2.1.1. Section 1 - Table of Contents. This should clearly list each item contained within
       the binder and the tab where it is located. It should be kept as current and accurate as
       possible and clearly display the date of the last update.
       6.2.1.2. Section 2 - Record of Review. The training section will review the career
       training folder for accuracy and completeness annually. Annotate the date of review as
       well as the name and office symbol of the reviewing official. Include any comments or
       discrepancies noted. If an expanded explanation is necessary, use an MFR signed by the
       unit training officer. File these documents behind the record of annual review in
       chronological order with the most recent on the bottom. No annual review is required for
       crewmembers in inactive/non-flying positions. Annotate the timeframe during which the
       individual was in non-flying status in appropriate chronological space in the record of
       annual review (i.e., May 2002-Jun 2005 Inactive/ANG Staff).
       6.2.1.3. Section 3 - Completed Training Records. This section will ideally contain all
       flight training records, usually recorded on an AF IMT 4025 – Aircrew Summary/Close-
       out Report (qualifications, certifications, specialized mission training, etc.), whether they
       are completed in-unit or at the FTU. The records will be in chronological order starting
       with initial qualification and ending with the most recently completed training on the top.
       Each training record within the folder will be tabbed separately to differentiate between
       programs. The tabs will be numbered in order with the member’s initial qualification
       (whether completed at the FTU or in-unit) labeled Tab #1.
   6.2.2. Career training folders are covered by the Privacy Act of 1974 and shall be used for
   official business only. Maintain folders in a secure area within the unit’s training section.
   Only instructors and supervisors should have regular access to these records. Individuals may
   sign out their own records.
   6.2.3. When a crewmember makes a PCS move, the squadron training section will copy the
   table of contents and record of annual review as a minimum. The unit shall seal the career

   training folder in an envelope along with the individual’s FEF and give it to the member for
   delivery to the next duty station.
       6.2.3.1. Crewmembers PCS to an active flying assignment. The losing unit squadron
       training section will keep these documents for six months from the date the individual
       departs home station, in the event records are lost or destroyed en route.
       6.2.3.2. Crewmembers PCS to an in-active flying assignment, separating or retiring. The
       losing unit squadron training section shall keep these copies until the member arrives at
       his next flying assignment or three years (whichever is less).
6.3. Entry into Training. Initiate a temporary training folder (AF Form 4022) for any of the
following: initial qualifications, mission qualifications, special qualification or certification
training, upgrade to the next higher crew qualification, requalification training, corrective action,
or additional training.
   6.3.1. The unit commander may waive the temporary training folder requirement if
   corrective action or additional training is limited. If initiated, the instructor or flight examiner
   who evaluated the crewmember's performance will enter comments pertinent to the training
   deficiency on AF IMT 4023. Use the existing AF Form 4022 for end-of-course evaluations
   that result in additional training.
   6.3.2. At the unit's discretion, a combined AF Form 4022 may be used for an individual
   undergoing more than one training program in a short period of time.
   6.3.3. Formal schools will send the AF IMT 4025, Aircrew Training Summary, to the
   trainee's gaining unit. Unit commanders will review formal school training.
   6.3.4. Training officers will maintain the training folders for their personnel in a location
   readily accessible to instructors and supervisory personnel. Trainees may review their folders
   at any time.
   6.3.5. Prior to all training periods, the instructor or trainer will review the AF Form 4022, to
   include AF IMT 4023 and 4024. Those areas not previously accomplished or those in which
   crewmembers require additional training will be noted for possible inclusion during the
   current training period. Review active training folders monthly and quarterly. Annotated
   reviews on AF IMT 4023.
   6.3.6. Upon completion of training, a copy of the summary/close-out report (AF IMT 4025)
   will be placed in the individual's career training folder. Career training folders are covered by
   the Privacy Act of 1974 and shall be used for official business only. Maintain folders in a
   secure area within the unit’s training section. Only instructors and supervisors should have
   regular access to these records. Individuals may sign out their own records.
       6.3.6.1. When a crewmember makes a PCS move, the squadron training section will
       copy the table of contents and record of annual review as a minimum. The unit shall seal
       the career training folder in an envelope along with the individual’s FEF and give it to the
       member for delivery to the next duty station.
       6.3.6.2. Crewmembers PCS to an active flying assignment. The losing unit squadron
       training section will keep these documents for six months from the date the individual
       departs home station, in the event records are lost or destroyed en route.

   write-ups adequately document student performance. If errors are discovered, take immediate
   action to correct them or document reasons the errors could not be corrected (i.e., instructor
   not available for signature). Note whether the trainee is progressing in a satisfactory manner,
   identify any significant problems encountered, and recommend any adjustments to training.
   Review the time elapsed between training flights. If an excessive amount of time has elapsed
   between training rides, document the reasons.
   6.7.2. The quarterly review should focus on trainee progression. The operations officer
   should take this time to determine if students are performing up to standards and the training
   program is meeting his goals or vision for the unit. Document any relevant findings and
   direct any changes to the training program.
6.8. Instructions for Closing Out Training Records, AF IMT 4025.

   6.8.1. For each formal training program, an AF IMT 4025 will be completed, detailing the
   individual's strengths, weaknesses, overall performance, and other pertinent information.
   This report will be filed in the crewmember's career training folder.
   6.8.2. Unit commanders will ensure comments on AF IMT 4025 do not reflect personnel
   opinions or biases. All comments must be supported by information contained in the AF
   IMT’s 4023 or 4024.
6.9. Instructions for Documenting Aircrew Qualifications. Units must accurately track all
qualifications and certifications for each crewmember. This is best accomplished through a
combination of the AF IMT 1381 (or ANG approved substitute), a locally-generated letter of Xs
(or equivalent), and the AF IMT 4324, Aviation Resource Management System Upgrade
Worksheet.
   6.9.1. AF IMT 1381 (or ANG approved substitute). Maintain the 1381 (or ANG approved
   substitute) in the member’s flight evaluation folder IAW AFI 11-2RC-26B Vol 2.
   6.9.2. Letter of Xs. A letter of Xs is the commander’s tool to track all qualifications,
   certifications and specialized training not appropriate for the 1381 (or ANG approved
   substitute) (i.e., locally required certifications, and training in new equipment or procedures).
   Specific procedures and format may be determined locally, but it must contain the following
   minimum information: crewmember name, highest qualification currently held, and any
   specialized training completed (not documented elsewhere). Include any other information
   required by the unit commander.
   6.9.3. AF IMT 4324. This form is the source document used to update aircrew certification,
   assign training profiles, and formal flying training dates in ARMS. The unit Stan/Eval and/or
   training office will complete this form and submit to SARM personnel to assign training
   profiles when a new crewmember in-processes to the unit. Complete a new form when
   training profiles are added, aircrew certification codes change, and when formal school
   courses are completed.

Terms
Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) Aircrew Member—An aircrew member who has
satisfactorily completed qualification training in the basic aircrew position and maintains aircraft
currency IAW this instruction.
Basic Mission Capable (BMC) Aircrew Member—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed mission qualification and is maintaining the applicable basic mission qualification
currency requirements of this instruction. Basic mission capable crewmembers may perform
primary crew duties on any unilateral training mission and CONUS missions.
Calendar Month—Requirements are due once per month and not necessarily associated with a
30/60 day requirement. For example, an aircrew member could accomplish the event on 1
February and then on 31 March the following month and still fulfill the requirement.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR) Aircrew Member—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed mission qualification and is maintaining all of the applicable mission qualification
currency requirements of this instruction.
Conversion Training—Training is normally associated with a unit conversion to another MDS.
Conversion training requires completion of a formal school initial qualification course. For unit
conversions, when formal school courses are not available to handle the throughput, ANG will
develop, and coordinate with the training command, in-unit training plans that maximize use of
highly experienced personnel as the initial cadre.
Difference Training—Training accomplished when changing between same design aircraft and
the amount of training needed for qualification does not warrant attendance at a formal
qualification course.
Dual Qualified—A crewmember who is qualified in more than one crew position in the same
MDS.

Event—A training item to be accomplished. Multiple events may be completed and logged
during a sortie unless specifically excluded elsewhere in this instruction.
Formal School Courseware—Training materials and programs developed for training aircrew
members at formal schools. It includes all student study guides, workbooks, computer-based
training lessons, instructor guides, and AF Form 4022, Individual Mission Grade Record, related
to the specific course.
Infrared Detection System (IDS)—A passive navigation/sensor system which detects radiant
infrared energy.
Instructor Certified Events—Training given to an aircrew member that requires an instructor
to certify the student's attainment of the required proficiency and knowledge levels as specified
in courseware and, if appropriate, AF IMT 4024. Instructor certified events are documented in
AF Form 4348 (or MAJCOM approved substitute).
Mission Design and Series (MDS) for Aircraft—The official designation for aerospace
vehicles used to represent a specific category of aerospace vehicles for operations, support, and
documentation purposes.
Mission Essential Task List (METL)—Combat-oriented training requirements. All AFSOC
aircrew training requirements should be in support of unit METLs.
Mission Events—The squadron Doctrinal (DOC) Statement defines required crew capabilities.
These capabilities/tactics/events can be categorized as either Core or Special Mission.
Mission Oriented Simulator Training—Training conducted in a WST or MRD that
incorporates a full mission profile. The focus of this training should be crew coordination and
problem solving.
Multiple Qualification—A crewmember who is qualified in more than one MDS.
Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI)—Aircraft assigned to a unit for performance of
its wartime mission. PMAI forms the basis for the allocation of operating resources to include
manpower, support equipment, and funding of flying hours.
Self-Contained Approach (SCA)—An approach conducted using self-contained navigation
systems on the aircraft.
Total Flying Time—Total time for all aircraft flown in military service to include student time.
Time accumulated must be in the aircrew member's current rating (i.e. pilot, navigator, etc.).
Training Status—A deficient status in which a crewmember must fly under the supervision of
an instructor when occupying a primary crew position. Once deficient items are corrected, the
crewmember is removed from training status.
Volume—For the purposes of this instruction, volume refers to the number of events an aircrew
member must accomplish in a given period of time (i.e., quarterly or semiannually).

            MISSION SYSTEMS OFFICER (MSO) REFRESHER COURSE

A2.1. General. The MSO refresher course is designed to improve standardization and to
provide maximum training to improve and refine MSO job skills. A simulator may be used if
available. Students will not be evaluated during the MSO Refresher Course. Until a course is
developed each unit is encouraged to develop their own course and complete annually.
