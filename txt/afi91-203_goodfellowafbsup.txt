This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction 91-203, Air
Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction, 15 June 2012, establishing local safety
procedures for the transportation and movement of students during adverse weather conditions.
NOTE: Due to the limited availability of buses, this supplement does not infer, when
implemented, students will arrive to classes on time; units must plan accordingly. This
supplement applies to 17th Training Group (17 TRG) military student personnel including tenant
military student personnel. It also applies to Goodfellow AFB organizations as tasked below.
Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained
per AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of according to the Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS),
located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.             Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)

conditions include strong surface winds, heavy rain, freezing precipitation, and thunderstorms
(i.e., frequent dangerous lightning and damaging winds, heavy rain, and hail).

11.4.2.2.2. (Added) Develop checklist procedures in support of this supplement to include
internal notification, establishing student pick-up and drop-off points, and the approximate
number of students requiring transportation. This number will be sent to the Vehicle Manager
(654-5753). When implemented during business hours (0730-1630), squadron POC will call
Vehicle Dispatch (654-5744) to coordinate pick-up and drop-off times. For after-hours
procedures, see paragraph 11.4.4.

                                                                                            3

11.4.2.2.4.1. (Added) Students form into school formations at their dormitory without
unnecessary delay (no sizing the formation, roll call, passing out of appointment slips, etc.) and

11.4.2.2.4.2. (Added) When released from class, students will assemble in formation without
delay and march to their dormitory.

11.4.2.2.4.3. (Added) All student movement will follow the proper route of march and comply
with applicable road guard and safety procedures.

11.4.2.3. (Added) Coordinate with the Food Service Officer (17 FSS/FSR) for extended dining

(88-89.9) or black (>90) flag), formations will be marched “At Ease.” Please note that the
temperature alone does not determine the WBGT. Humidity, solar heat, and ambient heat
(normal temperature) are all parts of the equation: .7(Humidity) + .2(Ambient) + .1(Solar) =
WBGT reading.

11.4.3.2. (Added) Cold Weather Conditions Affecting the Movement of Military Students.

11.4.3.2.1. (Added) During freezing rain, or heavy snow (greater than 2 inches in depth) or
when these conditions are forecast for the area and the marching distance is in excess of one

maintained. The formation must be called to attention prior to being given any further
commands (i.e., Flight Halt, Forward March).

chill factor is negative 20 degrees Fahrenheit or colder.

11.4.3.3. (Added) Lightning Conditions Affecting the Movement of Military Students.

11.4.3.3.1. (Added) When lightning is detected or observed, seek shelter and do not go out of
doors or remain out unless it is absolutely necessary (see AFI 91-203, paragraph 11.2, for
additional information on lightning safety).

11.4.3.3.2. (Added) For lightning within 5 nautical miles.

11.4.3.3.2.1. (Added) Personnel will take shelter in the nearest building and remain there until
the lightning is outside 5 nautical miles. If shelter is taken in a facility along the route of march,
the formation commander will telephone his/her squadron charge of quarters (CQ) and report
his/her location. No student formations will be allowed outside during lightning within 5
nautical miles and straggling of students is not allowed.

11.4.3.3.2.2. (Added) Bus transportation of students is authorized with a Lightning Watch
notification, limit outside formations. During a Lightning Warning notification the 17 TRG/CC
may authorize bus transportation as long as students can quickly transition from a building to an
enclosed bus, do not have students in an outside formation.

11.4.3.3.2.3. (Added) When thunderstorms are forecast for the local area, the guidon will not be
carried. To determine if thunderstorms are in the forecast, check the forecast link at
https://ows.barksdale.af.mil.

11.4.3.4. (Added) For the above and other adverse weather conditions, refer to Table 11.1
Actions for Weather Watch and Table 11.2 Actions for Weather Warning or Actual Observed
