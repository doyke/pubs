       depending on unit and individual needs.
       1.1.3. Training will be conducted by the Maintenance Qualification Training Program
       (MQTP), facility managers and/or supervisors. Use MQTP lesson plan and this
       instruction for all proficiency training. Unit training managers will load, update and track
       training using appropriate courses codes in G081.
       1.1.4. MXG training shall be documented in each individual’s Training Business Area
       (TBA). A separate TBA entry is required for each different style hangar door. TBA
       entries will be for hangars 1166 and 1176; 1106 and 1107 and manual doors in hangars
       1108, 1111, 1128, 1129, 1218. Hangar door awareness training will be documented in
       G081(course code MCNL000680)
    1.2. Building custodians are responsible for the following:
       1.2.1. Monitor the status of the doors and manage civil engineer (CE) work orders for
       required maintenance. Assign an urgent priority to all work orders that affect safety or
       normal door operation.
       1.2.2. Notify the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) ext. 3383, CE and the fire
       department of any door malfunction that causes lockout/tagout procedures to be initiated.
       Only qualified personnel and or the designated contractor, designated by G081 course
       code SAFE002024, will implement and remove lockout/tagout procedures. Doors that
       can be moved manually will be identified as such on the tag. Building custodians must
       maintain a lockout/tagout log book and track all doors that Qualified
       personnel/CE/Contractors have locked-out/tagged-out. MOC will coordinate any hangar
       door maintenance outside normal duty hours.
       1.2.3. Group facility manager will brief the maintenance group (MXG) commander

    MOC personnel will notify all production supervisors, who will ensure their respective
    hangar doors are closed.
    2.3. When the ambient air temperature is 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) or
    below, the hangar doors will be kept closed until aircraft or equipment have reached hangar
    and will only be opened when aircraft is positioned for entry or exit, and closed immediately
    thereafter.
    2.4. All hangar doors should be kept closed whenever possible to prevent bird entry. To
    preclude damage to the bird entry barriers in Buildings 1106 and 1107, do not open the doors

3. AIRCRAFT HANGARING:
  3.1. The tow supervisor will ensure:
     3.1.1. Hangar doors are properly operated, opened and closed per operating instructions
     located on hangar door.
     3.1.2. All ceiling mounted air ducts that could strike the aircraft are properly positioned
     to provide adequate clearance.
     3.1.3. The aircraft is towed along the proper tow path for the intended spot and
     maintenance action (e.g. PE, wash, jack) and centered properly on the correct center line
     and wheel parking spots.
  3.2. Due to the design of Hangar 1106/1107, there may be times when adjacent aircraft and
  hangar doors require movement to allow neighboring aircraft to be positioned properly. In
  those cases, both tow supervisors and a production leader(pro-super) will meet, discuss and
  brief the full plan of aircraft and door movements. The protection and safety of aircraft and
  personnel will be maintained at all times. Two aircraft shall not be positioned with tails full-
  in (diagonally), in Hangar 1106/1107 slots 2 and 3.
  3.3. When parking an aircraft in any hangar, the tow supervisor will complete section 1 and
  2 of the Aircraft Hangaring Requirements (AHR) Checklist (Attachment 2). The
  AMXS/MXS pro-super will provide the checklist and the tow supervisor will ensure the
  checklist is signed legibly and placed in the front of the aircraft forms binder once all the
  actions of the aforementioned checklist are complete.
     3.3.1. When removing an aircraft from a hangar, the tow supervisor completes section 3
     and 4 of the same checklist and hands the completed checklist back to the AMXS/MXS
     pro- super. The pro-super will verify that all items of section 3 and 4 have been
     completed satisfactorily.
