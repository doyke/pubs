Section A—THE PROGRAM

1. Introduction. The 11th Wing Exercise Program exists to enhance readiness and improve crisis
response. It outlines procedures for organizing military exercises and distributing the results throughout
the 11th Wing.

2. Objectives. The goal of the 11th Wing Exercise Program is to maximize the benefits gained through
exercises, specifically by enhancing readiness, boosting combat capability, streamlining procedures, and
improving system support.

3. Policies and Procedures. The wing commander uses the Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) to assess
the wing's ability to perform its war and peacetime contingency missions. The wing will plan, conduct,
and assess exercises as required by this instruction and other applicable directives. EET exercises must
measure, record, and analyze performance to identify problems and their causes requiring corrective
actions. Each functional area participating in EET exercises must provide assistance to the EET chief as
required (for example, EET membership, exercise scenario development, evaluator training, report prep-
aration, etc.). The quality of personnel assigned to the EET and the priority given to a realistic, demanding
exercise program are direct reflections of the wing's support for the USAF Readiness Program.

Section B—THE EXERCISE EVALUATION TEAM (EET)

4. Goals. The EET is a key element in the 11th Wing Exercise Program. It is responsible for planning,
conducting, and assessing all exercises required in this instruction or involving more than one base unit.
The EET provides commanders, staff, and functional managers independent information on their overall
capabilities to respond to a crisis or contingency.

5. Membership:
    5.1. EET Chief:
       5.1.1. The EET chief is the wing point of contact (POC) for exercise planning, coordinating, and
       interfacing with wing and tenant units. He or she develops, schedules, conducts, and assesses local
       exercises.
       5.1.2. The wing commander decides the grade and experience required and appoints the EET
       chief in writing. The EET chief will be assigned to the wing XP.
    5.2. Deputy Chief. Deputy chiefs will be appointed where operations and staffing allow. They may
    specialize in one or more types of exercise (MARE, deployment, etc.) or in other areas (exercise plan-
    ning, after-action reporting, etc.).
    5.3. Members. The EET chief determines the number of evaluators required and the functional areas
    to provide them. Members will include individuals from each functional area assessed. Commanders/
    Directors will assign highly qualified officers, NCOs, or civilians to the EET. EET members should
    have broad expertise in their functional specialties and serve at least 1 year following completion of
    initial training. EET members are appointed in writing by their squadron commander or division
    chief. The installation deployment officer or civil engineering readiness flight chief should not be
    appointed to the EET. If possible, individuals identified to deploy should not be assigned to the EET.
11WGI10-4 24 APRIL 2001                                                                                   5


6. Training. The EET chief identifies any EET training requirements in addition to those mentioned
below, ensures EET members are trained, and documents all EET member training.
   6.1. EET Chief. The EET chief should attend the On-Scene Commander's (OSC) course as soon as
   possible after being appointed. In addition, EET chiefs will attend the USAF Inspection School. The
   wing exercise budget will provide funding for these courses.
   6.2. EET Members:
       6.2.1. EET members will complete within 45 workdays of assignment initial training on EET-spe-
       cific subjects (local policies, exercise planning, execution, evaluation, etc.).
       6.2.2. EET members will attend the USAF IG course as soon as practical. EET Chief will sched-
       ule the course at Bolling at least once a year. EET members will not be sent TDY to attend this
       course.
       6.2.3. Functional managers will train EET members before they assess readiness exercises as fol-
       lows:
           6.2.3.1. EET members assigned to assess disaster preparedness exercises should receive train-
           ing according to AFI 32-4001, Disaster Preparedness Planning and Operations; AFI
           32-4002, Hazardous Material Emergency Planning And Response Compliance; and AFMAN
           32-4004, Emergency Response Operations within 45 workdays of assignment.
           6.2.3.2. Deployment evaluators should receive appropriate training according to AFI 10-403,
           Deployment Planning and 11th Wing Deployment Plan, 10-403.
       6.2.4. EET members designated to draw smoke-generating devices or ground-burst simulators
       must be trained and qualified on the use of protective equipment according to AFMAN 91-201,
       Explosives Safety Standards.

7. EET Chief Responsibilities. The EET Chief is responsible for overall management of the local readi-
ness exercise evaluation program. While performing these duties, the EET Chief is directly responsible to
the wing commander. Specific responsibilities are mentioned throughout this instruction. In addition, the
EET Chief will:
   7.1. Manage the EET budget and supply account.
   7.2. Maintain EET files and records according to AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and
   Responsibilities, and AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule. Maintain exercise material
   used to conduct each exercise (master scenario event lists, scenarios, etc.) as required for planning and
   reference.
   7.3. At least quarterly brief exercise trend analysis at wing staff meetings or other forums where the
   wing senior staff is in attendance.
   7.4. Manage the EET publications account. As a minimum, maintain the following publications:
       7.4.1. This instruction.

6                                                                            11WGI10-4 24 APRIL 2001


       7.4.5. AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities.
       7.4.6. Wing deployment plan.
    7.5. Have ready access to the following publications (as supplemented):
       7.5.1. AFMAN 10-401, Operation Plan and Concept Plan Development
       7.5.2. AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning.
       7.5.3. AFMAN 32-4004, Emergency Response Operations.
       7.5.4. AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and Training.
       7.5.5. AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards.
    7.6. Manage the EET munitions account as follows:
       7.6.1. Forecast annually for munitions according to AFI 21-208, Munitions Forecast, Allocation,
       and Buy Budget Processes. AFCAT 21-209, Ground Munitions, outlines munitions available for
       EET usage.
       7.6.2. Within 15 working days after the end of each fiscal quarter, report EET munitions expendi-
       ture to for each type of munitions allocated. Maintain expenditure data for (as a minimum) the cur-
       rent and two previous fiscal years.
    7.7. Develop a list of facilities exempt from total evacuation during exercises. Facilities to be consid-
    ered include: C4 systems facilities, law enforcement and fire protection facilities, schools and
    child-care facilities, medical and dental facilities, and recreation, exchange, and commissary facilities,
    etc. Individuals participating in specific activities (military court proceedings, chapel services, promo-
    tion testing, etc.) may also be exempt from exercise participation.

8. Recognition Program. Wing members identified by the EET as Benchmark Performers will be eligi-
ble for time off awards at the determination of their unit commander/Director.

Section C—PLANNING THE EXERCISE

9. Design and Development. Planning encompasses all aspects of designing and developing exercises.
Selected EET members work together to develop exercises for the wing readiness exercise program. Indi-
vidual members contribute functional expertise. The EET Chief will check the schedules of host and asso-
ciate units to prevent conflicts and may designate trusted agents to assist in developing exercises. Trusted
agents become part of the EET and normally contribute specific expertise to develop key aspects of an
exercise. Include safety personnel in exercise planning.

10. Scope of Exercises. Exercises will be sufficiently challenging to ensure adequate evaluation of wing
capabilities, plans, and procedures. The EET will use exercise guidelines and criteria in AFI 90-201, this
instruction, and other applicable directives that prescribe the exercise. Exercises should not bring unfa-
vorable publicity to the Air Force. The wing commander determines the extent of interruption to the wing
mission.
11WGI10-4 24 APRIL 2001                                                                                       7


11. Security. Security is an integral part of exercise planning. All aspects of EET exercises will be held
in strict confidence. Exercise compromise may cause "false starts" and prevent true evaluation of wing
response capabilities. If a significant compromise occurs, the exercise should be terminated.

12. Objectives. The EET Chief works with senior wing leadership to establish exercise objectives.
Design each exercise with specific objectives to identify or correct problem areas and increase the profi-
ciency of all wing agencies. Objectives will be developed by reviewing special interest items, require-
ments in instructions and plans, past exercise reports, reports of corrective action, and operational
readiness inspection (ORI) reports.

13. Master Scenario Events List (MSEL):
   13.1. The MSEL is a compilation of scripted events depicting activities that will be injected during
   the exercise by the EET for exercise participant action. The EET develops the MSEL. Participating
   agencies can suggest events for inclusion.
   13.2. The EET will create at least one MSEL event for each objective. List MSEL events by the
   date-time group (DTG) of injection.

14. Implementers/Roll Players:
   14.1. Prepare implementers/roll players to trigger MSEL events. Implementers/roll players initiate
   exercise inputs made at a planned time to a specific function or individual to support a specific MSEL
   item.
   14.2. Implementers/roll players also portray the situation at the simulated accident site (smoke muni-
   tions, weapons shapes, moulaged casualties, mannequins, aircraft parts, etc.). Implementers should
   contribute realism to an exercise, and they are the key devices for exercise control.

15. Munitions. List all training smoke-generating devices or ground-burst simulators planned for use
during an exercise in the exercise scenario. The wing commander must approve the use of training muni-
tions. Safety requirement identified in Attachment 2 will be followed.

16. Coordination:
   16.1. During exercise planning the EET representatives will:
       16.1.1. Coordinate exercise objectives with the medical readiness office to ensure that exercise
       scenarios include events allowing completion of AFI 41-106 requirements, when possible.
       16.1.2. Coordinate the exercise scenario and timing with the medical treatment facility (MTF)
       commander to minimize disruption of health services delivery.
   16.2. Coordinate with the base contracting office prior to conducting any exercise that will delay or
   disrupt the work of contract employees. Consider potential contractor assertions of government gener-
   ated schedule delays or additional costs.
   16.3. For exercises involving (or potentially involving) fire protection or air traffic control agencies,
   coordinate the time of the exercise, but not the exercise details, with the fire chief and chief of air traf-
   fic control operations at least 30 minutes before the exercise.
8                                                                          11WGI10-4 24 APRIL 2001


    16.4. Coordinate all off-base exercises with local civil authorities (local governing authorities, fire
    department, police, sheriff, etc.).

17. Approval. The EET Chief obtains the wing commander's approval before establishing or conducting
exercises. The Commander will determine appropriate levels of participation for personnel directly
involved in daily operations to ensure exercises are as effective as possible without unacceptably impact-
ing the primary mission.

18. Pre-Exercise Briefing. The EET Chief conducts a pre-exercise briefing for EET members. This
briefing will include, as a minimum:
    18.1. Exercise scenario.
    18.2. Date, time, and location of the exercise.
    18.3. Timing of events.
    18.4. Agencies to be assessed.
    18.5. Situation cards and props for use in the exercise.
    18.6. Safety considerations.
    18.7. Time and location for exercise debriefing.
    18.8. Communication.

Section D—EXECUTING THE EXERCISE

19. Scenario. The exercise scenario is executed on the date and time planned or as modified by direction
of the EET Chief. Execution begins at the start of the exercise (STARTEX). The scenario continues until
terminated by the EET chief at the end of the exercise (EN/DEX). Ideally, the scenario should proceed to
a logical concluding point, but the EET chief or wing commander may terminate the exercise sooner for
safety considerations, conflicting real world emergencies, or if the EET chief or wing commander deter-
mines all exercise objectives were met.

20. Control. EET members monitor MSEL status during exercises and direct the pace of the exercise by
injecting implementers (messages, memorandums, etc.). Participants may take actions negating a planned
event or requiring an "ad hoc" event to keep the exercise on track. If changes occur, the EET Chief must
ensure all team members are notified to adjust MSEL. EET members must ensure the exercise does not
expand beyond its planned scope. If the situation warrants, the EET member on scene, must stop the exer-
cise and notify the EET Chief.

21. Data Collection. EET members will collect data on exercise participant actions, significant exercise
events and other information required for after action reports and debriefings.

Section E—ASSESSING THE EXERCISE DATA

22. Assessment Documents. After an exercise, the EET will assess data collected to determine whether
exercise objectives were met. The focus will be on the exercise objectives. The EET will document the
results, and give feedback to players. The EET Chief will provide a hot wash briefing to the wing com-
11WGI10-4 24 APRIL 2001                                                                                   9


mander, group commanders, and directors. Additionally, the EET Chief will provide a report for each
exercise. The hot wash and report will provide commanders, staff, and functional managers direct feed-
back on the overall readiness of the wing and individual units or functional areas. Exercise grading is not
required. However, if grading is requested by the wing commander, the EET will follow the grading crite-
rion in AFI 90-201.

23. Debriefings:
   23.1. On termination of the exercise, the EET and trusted agents will convene in a closed hot wash to
   review and assess the exercise. The initial debriefing is closed to key exercise participants to allow a
   free discussion of the exercise between EET members. EET members will validate all findings and
   observations with exercise participants as soon as possible after the EET hot wash.
   23.2. Within 3 workdays of the exercise, the EET Chief should hold the Wing hot wash for the exer-
   cise with the wing commander, group commanders, and directors.
   23.3. If the wing commander requests, the EET will hold an exercise briefing for participants on exer-
   cise results in an open session. This briefing will be held within 5 workdays after the exercise. Partic-
   ipants attending this briefing should include working level personnel when possible. The objective of
   this debriefing should be to develop a common dialogue between EET members and exercise partici-
   pants.

24. After-Action Reports. A formal after-action report will be prepared for each exercise credited
toward the requirements shown in Table 1. Reports may be prepared for other exercises conducted, but
are not required. The wing commander approves the final report. NOTE: The reports required by this
instruction are operating documents and thus exempt from reports control symbol (RCS) licensing
requirements according to paragraph 2.11.10 of AFI 37-124, The Information Collections and Reports
Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Collections.
   24.1. Format and Content. Reports will be prepared in the format of the Joint Universal Lessons
   Learned System (JULLS). EET members contribute to the report, and the EET chief (or designated
   representative) consolidates inputs and produces the final report. The report will include information
   and recommendations on all findings, observations, and benchmark performers. EET will assign an
   OPR for each finding and validate all findings before publishing the report. Each lesson learned will
   describe a problem encountered and solved, a problem encountered but not solved, or successful
   actions future operations or exercises can use.
   24.2. Distribution. Exercise reports will be distributed to participating agencies within 20 workdays
   after the exercise.
   24.3. Marking. Mark EET reports, "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY." Release these reports to the public
   only to the extent required by AFI 37-131, Freedom of Information Act Program.

25. Corrective Actions:
   25.1. Exercise results should be used to improve local procedures or recommend revised procedures
   to participants. The EET will not consider discrepancies identified in EET reports corrected until cor-
   rective action is completed and approved by the commander or designated representative and correc-
   tive action is validated by another exercise, testing of the applicable procedure, etc.
   25.2. The EET Chief will:
10                                                                              11WGI10-4 24 APRIL 2001


        25.2.1. Review corrective actions and perform trend analysis of the exercise program.
        25.2.2. Identify recurring or common deficiencies.
        25.2.3. Track corrective actions and suspenses for follow-up actions.
        25.2.4. Ensure corrective actions are appropriate and correct for the root cause of the problem.
        25.2.5. Identify nonconcurrences and incomplete corrective actions that could not be resolved at
        a lower level to the group or wing commander (as applicable) for resolution.
        25.2.6. Maintain a record of corrective actions for at least 2 years.
        25.2.7. Validate corrective actions during subsequent exercises.
     25.3. Functional managers will correct discrepancies identified in the exercise report and provide a
     written reply to the EET Chief as directed by the suspense date established in the report (normally
     within 10 workdays of the date of report). If corrective actions cannot be completed as directed, func-
     tional managers must submit follow-up reports at least monthly until the action is completed.
     25.4. See AFI 41-106 for additional requirements for exercise documentation, after-action reporting,
     discrepancy identification and tracking, etc. Although the EET does not fulfill these requirements,
     medical EET members must coordinate with the wing's medical readiness staff function to ensure
     requirements are completed.

Section F—EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS

26. Minimum Exercise Requirements:
     26.1. Table 1. lists minimum exercise requirements. The paragraphs referenced in the table contain
     additional instructions for each particular type of exercise.
     26.2. Complex exercise scenarios may include several individual exercises (MARE, NDRE, etc.)
     Each exercise may be credited against multiple Table 1. exercise requirements if the criteria for each
     exercise (as specified in this instruction and other prescribing directives) are assessed and each exer-
     cise is documented in a report.
     26.3. Exercise participation during inspector general (IG) inspections or other higher headquarters
     directed activities (command post exercises, staff assistance visits (SAV), etc.) encompassing a multi-
     functional cross-section of wing personnel may be credited toward overall exercise requirements. An
     after-action report is required for each exercise credited toward Table 1. requirements.
     26.4. Do not conduct EET evaluations during real-world contingencies. However, real-world contin-
     gencies may be credited toward overall exercise requirements if the wing commander determines the
     contingency satisfies the requirements for the type of exercise credited. In that case, forward a copy of
     the commander's determination to AETC AOS/AOX. No exercise report is required, but an
     after-action report detailing lessons learned during the contingency response is recommended. Dis-
     tribute such reports locally and to other AETC exercise evaluation teams.
11WGI10-4 24 APRIL 2001                                                                                11

27. Major Accident Response Exercise (MARE):
   27.1. A major accident is an accident involving DoD material or activities of such a magnitude as to
   warrant response by the base disaster response force. It is differentiated from day-to-day emergencies
   and incidents routinely handled by base agencies without the disaster response force. A major acci-
   dent may involve one or more of the following:
       27.1.1. Hazardous substances such as radioactive materials and toxic industrial chemicals, explo-
       sives, or nuclear, biological, chemical, and conventional weapons.
       27.1.2. Class A mishap.
       27.1.3. Extensive property damage.
       27.1.4. Grave risk of injury or death to installation personnel or the public.
       27.1.5. Adverse public reaction.
   27.2. MAREs are required once per calendar quarter. At least once a year, conduct a MARE involving
   the following:
       27.2.1. Hazardous material (HAZMAT) emergency response teams. (Comply with AFI 32-4002
       requirements.)
       27.2.2. Mass casualties. (See the definition in Attachment 1.)
       27.2.3. Start time before or after normal duty hours.

28. Natural Disaster Response Exercise (NDRE). Natural disasters include hurricanes, tornadoes,
storms, floods, high water, wind-driven water, tidal surge, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
landslides, mud slides, severe snow storms, drought, or other catastrophe not caused by humans. An
annual NDRE is required to assess the installation's ability to respond to the types of natural disasters
most likely to strike its geographic area as specified in AFI 32-4001.

29. Deployment Exercise (DEPLOYEX). Deployment exercises assess an installation's ability to effec-
tively deploy unit type codes (UTC) in support of actual or notional war plans and are required quarterly.
12                                                                            11WGI10-4 24 APRIL 2001


Base scenarios on approximately the maximum personnel and cargo requirements of the most stringent
family of plans' time-phased force deployment data (TPFDD). Integrate 11th Wing and associate UTCs
into a single exercise whenever possible. Incorporate both 11th Wing and associate formats and require-
ments into exercise message traffic. Use notional taskings to test short-notice deployments for the Wing
or associates. Each individual identified to deploy will participate in at least one deployment exercise
annually. Adhere to requirements in
AFI 10-403 and the 11th Wing Deployment Plan, 10-403.

30. Antiterrorism Exercise. Conduct an annual antiterrorism exercise. Exercise threat conditions
(THREATCON) Bravo. Also exercise THREATCON. The base antiterrorism working group will help
develop comprehensive exercise scenarios for each THREATCON. Conduct exercises according to AFI
31-209, The Air Force Resource Protection Program, and AFI 31-210, The Air Force Antiterrorism (AT)
Program.

31. Recall. Fully test the base personnel recall process at least annually.

32. Contingency Employment Exercise (CONEX):
     32.1. All personnel and equipment assigned to deployment-tasked UTCs must be prepared to deploy,
     operate in an adverse environment, and perform their wartime missions. In order to assess readiness,
     conduct at least one CONEX annually, preferably in conjunction with a deployment exercise.
     32.2. The Wing must develop a CONEX plan based on local UTC taskings. As a minimum, the plan
     must address applicable mission support areas and criteria described in AFI 90-201, attachment 10.
     Additionally, the EET will address any exercise support required beyond that provided by OPLAN
     sourced UTCs (for example, employment feeding for wing personnel when no Services UTC exists).
     32.3. CONEX duration will vary depending on local UTC taskings. However, CONEX must be of
     sufficient duration to allow the assessment of all applicable areas.

33. Attack Response Exercise (ARE). The Wing will conduct an attack response exercise at least once
a year. The exercise should closely resemble the type of attack most likely to occur at the base (for exam-
ple, terrorist, chemical, etc.).

34. Medical Readiness Exercises. AFI 41-106 prescribes numerous exercise requirements for medical
units. While the EET does not specifically assess each medical exercise, the EET chief should make every
effort to include these requirements in EET exercises. This increases realism and reduces duplication of
effort. General requirements are listed in subparagraphs 35.1 through 35.6; refer to AFI 41-106 for specif-
ics.
     34.1. Disaster Casualty Control Plan (DCCP). The DCCP describes how medical personnel operate
     and respond during peacetime and natural disasters. The plan must be exercised twice a year.
     34.2. Medical Contingency Support Plan (MCSP). The MCSP describes medical contingency and
     wartime activities. This plan must be exercised annually.
     34.3. Medical Contingency Response Plan (MCRP). For units using a MCRP in place of a DCCP and
     MCSP, conduct a peacetime response exercise twice a year and a wartime mission-specific exercise at
     least annually.
11WGI10-4 24 APRIL 2001                                                                                   13


   34.4. Recall Plans. Medical units are required to exercise their recall plan quarterly. Degraded com-
   munication capability procedures must be exercised once every two calendar years.
   34.5. Alternate Medical Facility (AMF) Exercise. This annual exercise includes review of procedures
   for moving patients, personnel, equipment, and supplies (as appropriate), and establishing medical
   functions and services at the AMF.
   34.6. National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) Exercise. Air Force NDMS Federal Coordinating
   Centers (FCC) must conduct an annual exercise with civilian hospitals that participate in the NDMS
   program.

35. State Funeral Response. This exercise should be used to test the Wing’s ability to respond to the
taskings identified in the 11 WG State Funeral Plan. The identified tasking for the USAF Honor Guard
(with the exception of the initial deployment team) and the USAF Band will be levied on a case by case
basis.

36. Other Exercises. Other exercises and scenarios do not specifically require evaluation by the EET,
but they may be included in EET-conducted exercises such as anti-robbery and structural fire exercises.
Anti-robbery and structural fire scenarios are exercised regularly by the security forces and fire depart-
ment, respectively, and these scenarios may be included in EET-assessed exercises.

Section G—EXERCISE SIMULATIONS, GUIDELINES, AND DEPLOYMENTS

37. Simulations:
   37.1. Exercises should employ the "train the way you fight" concept, emphasizing maximum partici-
   pation and minimum simulation to demonstrate actual capabilities. Exercises will stress maximum
   realism consistent with safety, mission accomplishment, security, and financial constraints.
   37.2. Exercise simulations will be held to a minimum. Attachment 2 (none yet) to this instruction
   includes a listing of locally approved simulations. This listing will be reviewed annually. After the
   review, the EET Chief will recommend any changes to the simulation listing to the Wing Commander
   for approval. The EET Chief will approve, in writing, other simulations requested during an exercise.
   However, periodic testing of all but the most sensitive procedures (actual use of narcotics, etc.) will be
   tested on a recurring basis.
   37.3. A Simulation should not prevent exercise of a function or procedure. For example, simulated
   money might be substituted for actual cash in an armed robbery, or 3- by 5-inch cards might be used
   to represent narcotics or other controlled substances. Simulations, where required, should allow a rep-
   resentative evaluation of a task.

38. Guidelines. The guidelines in subparagraphs 38.1. through 38.27. apply to the planning and execu-
tion of all EET-conducted exercises.
   38.1. Environmental Compliance. Comply with applicable federal, state, and local environmental
   laws and standards.
   38.2. OPSEC and COMSEC. Follow OPSEC and COMSEC guidance according to AFI 10-1101,
   Operations Security (OPSEC) Instructions.
14                                                                          11WGI10-4 24 APRIL 2001


     38.3. Radios and Cellular Phones. Comply with AFI 33-106, Managing High Frequency Radios,
     Land Mobile Radios, Cellular Telephones, and the Military Affiliate Radio System, when using
     intra-base radios and (or) cellular phones.
     38.4. Identification of EET Members. The EET will wear hats and badges identifying them as EET
     members.
     38.5. Penetration of Priority Resources. Exercise scenarios including attempts to penetrate priority
     resources must be closely coordinated with the security forces.
     38.6. Munitions. Comply with AFMAN 91-201 when using exercise munitions.
     38.7. Props and Implementers. Exercise props and implementers should conform as closely as possi-
     ble to the actual item they represent. As much as possible, the EET will use mockups, condemned sup-
     plies, equipment, moulage kits, and actual documents to enhance realism.
        38.7.1. Mark internal EET exercise control documents, "CONTROL EYES ONLY."
        38.7.2. Prominently mark exercise documents, forms, publications, messages, etc., intended for
        player action, "EXERCISE" or "FOR EXERCISE USE ONLY."
        38.7.3. Status cards may be used to provide the simulated status of equipment or facilities
        involved in exercises.
        38.7.4. The EET will use moulage and trauma manikins to simulate various personnel injuries
        (cuts, bleeding, compound fractures, severed limbs, etc.).
        38.7.5. When buildings and equipment are to be simulated as damaged, damage cards will be used
        to indicate the damage of the equipment, buildings, or facilities. The cards will be displayed prom-
        inently or given to exercise participants.
     38.8. Identification of Exercise Communications. All participants will begin and end all exercise
     communications, such as radio and telephone, with phrases like "This is an exercise input,"Exercise
     transmission," or "Exercise message."
     38.9. Safety and Security Violations:
        38.9.1. If a potential or actual safety or security violation is observed, EET members and (or)
        exercise participants will take immediate action to prevent personal injury, damage to equipment,
        or the release of classified information.
        38.9.2. If an actual accident occurs or if a person is injured during an exercise, any EET member
        or participant may delay or terminate the entire exercise and give necessary aid. Preface any radio
        or telephone transmission with "This is an actual emergency."
        38.9.3. If an actual emergency develops while an exercise is in progress, the EET Chief, on-scene
        commander, or wing commander may delay or terminate the exercise as necessary.
     38.10. Recall of Personnel. Do not recall people from leave or temporary duty. Do not use simulations
     to overcome personnel shortfalls except for individuals who would normally be recalled (for example,
     personnel on leave or TDY who could be recalled in time to participate). Prepare appropriate recall
     messages and mark them "NOT FOR TRANSMISSION."
     38.11. Evacuation of Bases. Simulate base evacuation.
11WGI10-4 24 APRIL 2001                                                                                   15


  38.12. Evacuation of Buildings. Attachment D includes a list of facilities exempt from total evacua-
  tion during exercises. Personnel conducting business when an evacuation is directed may conclude
  their business, but must remain in the facility until the evacuation portion of the exercise is complete.
  For exempt buildings will be checked for evacuation plans. Additionally, assigned personnel will be
  questioned to make sure they know how to evacuate during an exercise.
  38.13. Individual Protective Equipment. During exercises, all individual protective equipment
  (including protective masks) will be worn as appropriate for the situation unless there is a lack of
  equipment or wearing protective equipment creates an unsafe condition. Personnel driving govern-
  ment vehicles will wear chemical warfare equipment (including masks) when required, consistent
  with safety standards. Personnel will not wear masks when driving off base or when operating a pri-
  vately owned vehicle. Pregnant women are not required to wear chemical warfare equipment during
  exercises.
  38.14. Shelter Operations. Accomplish shelter operations as completely as possible consistent with
  the threat, prudent cost benefit, and logistics limits.
  38.15. Participation by Medical Personnel. During any exercise, the 11 MED Group Commander may
  withhold or withdraw medical personnel required to respond to an actual medical emergency. With the
  wing commander's approval, the 11 MED Group Commander may withhold or withdraw medical per-
  sonnel to avoid adversely affecting scheduled patient care.
  38.16. Participation by Department of the Air Force (DAF) Civilian Personnel. All DAF civilians
  must participate in EET exercises. Emergency essential DAF civilian employees will participate as
  specified in AFI 36-507, Mobilization of the Civilian Workforce. Civilian overtime is at the discretion
  of the wing commander.
  38.17. Contract Exercises. Contractors with no contingency or readiness requirements are exempt
  from exercise participation. This does not alleviate contractor personnel from obeying lawful orders
  of responding forces. Do not include exercise functions being performed under contract unless the
  exercise requirements are established in the contract. When such services could affect the outcome of
  an exercise, make sure assessments of the exercise point out the need to continue these services, by
  contract or otherwise, during crisis situations. Initiate action to revise the contract if required. Report
  performance or contract deficiencies simultaneously to the contract administrator, quality assurance
  evaluator, and contractor.
  38.18. Exercise Correspondence. Prepare required exercise messages, but do not transmit them. Give
  required operational reports to the EET in writing.
  38.19. Emergency Vehicles. When responding to an exercise, emergency vehicles will use warning
  lights but not sirens. Fire vehicles must follow the guidance in AFI 32-2001, The Fire Protection
  Operations and Fire Prevention Program. Use vehicle-mounted sirens to announce simulated emer-
  gency withdrawal from the accident site. Do not use warning lights or sirens when responding to
  off-base exercises.
  38.20. Requests for Support or Coordination. Send requests for support or coordination, which would
  normally go to higher headquarters or off-base agencies, to the EET for resolution unless directed oth-
  erwise in the tasking instructions.
  38.21. Traffic Control. Vehicle operators must abide by posted speed limits and traffic control
  devices.
16                                                                          11WGI10-4 24 APRIL 2001


     38.22. Rental and Purchase of Equipment. If any vehicles, equipment, or supplies are to be rented or
     purchased, prepare but do not process necessary paperwork. Present completed paperwork to EET.
     38.23. EET Roll Player/Perpetrator Actions. During exercises, safety is paramount and EET perpetra-
     tors will obey all orders of responding security police forces. They will not:
        38.23.1. Attempt to flee, struggle against, or otherwise actively evade the response force. How-
        ever, EET members may attempt to passively evade or hide from exercise participants as long as
        they comply with orders upon detection.
        38.23.2. Be readily identifiable as EET members. However, they will carry identification for
        proving EET membership on request.
        38.23.3. Use actual weapons or blank ammunition.
        38.23.4. Use simulated weapons in a threatening manner. A simulated weapon is anything that
        looks like a real weapon, i.e., toy guns and knives, air guns, etc.
        38.23.5. Take any threatening action toward responding forces.

39. Deployment Guidelines. The following guidelines apply during deployment exercises:
     39.1. The EET will randomly select a sample of at least 10 percent of each chalk after the initial
     self-identified individuals have processed through the processing line and had their problems cor-
     rected. Process this sample, which may include self-identified personnel, through the entire personnel
     deployment function (PDF) line, which will provide a list of discrepancies found in these samples.
     Summarize the discrepancies in the exercise report. (Adverse trends may indicate the need for an
     increased sample size.)
     39.2. Do not list individual names of personnel with discrepancies in formal EET reports. Instead,
     summarize a listing of discrepancies and assigned units.
     39.3. After each deployment chalk has completed processing and is cleared for departure, the EET
     will inspect personal and mobility bags from at least 10 percent of each chalk. Include personnel from
     each unit in the chalk. Summarize and report the results in the EET report. (The EET chief will coor-
     dinate with the installation deployment officer on the timing of the 10-percent check to prevent
     adverse interruption of the schedule of events.)
     39.4. Simulations will not be used to overcome shortfalls in materiel or personnel. Shortfalls will be
     identified through levy reclama and equipment assistance requests.
     39.5. Simulated materiel will be accounted for on manifests and load lists. Use containers of similar
     size and process them like the actual materiel (for example, marked, documented, palletized, netted,
     and tied down). For simulated movements, complete TDY special orders, but do not authenticate
     them.

         SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR SIMULATORS AND SMOKE PRODUCING
                       MUNITIONS DURING EXERCISES


1. Training and Exercise Plans Involving Explosives. The Exercise Team Chief prepares a risk assessment
and detailed list of explosives detailing the NSN, HC/D, and explosive weights authorized for use in the
exercise and a detailed list of locations where munitions will be deployed. The installation commander
must give written approval of the plan. weapons safety personnel will be included in all exercise planning.


2. Commanders will ensure personnel not normally associated with explosive operations and exercises are
not exposed to explosive hazards.


3. Explosives will not be taken into public assembly places except when required by essential mission
needs or immediate security requirements.


4. Only US Air Force stock-listed items are authorized for use.


5. Only trained personnel can prepare and activate these devices. Qualified personnel will provide training
on an annual basis to personnel whose duties require them to initiate training simulators. The qualified
personnel providing training will be determined locally but may be from explosives ordnance disposal
(EOD), munitions, or weapons safety. These qualified trainers must have had at least four hours of class-
room instructions, passed a written test and be qualified to handle, maintain and inspect these items. It is
the responsibility of the user organization to request training and maintain training records. Evaluation
teams using these devices must present proof of training to the base safety office, prior to use.


6. Minimum distances.


7. Personnel or vehicle: Maintain a minimum of 125 feet separation. Personnel who initiate these muni-
tions may be closer than 125 feet, but they should be as close to 125 feet as possible and have their back
to the munitions. Execption: no specific distance is required for non-toxic colored smoke grenades.
Avoid the smoke or follow actions required in AFM 91-201, Table 2.3.


8. Facilities without facing window: Maintain a minimum separation of 100 feet. (IF MUNITIONS ARE
USED NEAR A FACILITY, OCCUPANT’S WILL BE NOTIFIED PRIOR TO ACTIVATION.) Facility
manager will be included in the planning phase.

9. Facilities with facing window: Maintain a minimum separation of 200 feet. (IF MUNITIONS ARE
USED NEAR A FACILITY, OCCUPANT’S WILL BE NOTIFIED PRIOR TO ACTIVATION.) Facility
manager will be included in the planning phase.


10. Petroleum, oil and lubricants storage: Maintain a minimum separation of 200 feet.


11. Smoke from grenades and pots are sometimes toxic in high concentrations. Contact Environmental
Management and the fire department prior to use. These items, along with generators and flares present a
fire hazard. Remove combustible materials before functioning. Consider winds and fire hazards such as
dry grass or fire bans. Consider using a barrier to control spread of heat during functioning of grenades
and smoke pots.


12. Ground burst or hand grenade simulators present a blast hazard. Exercise caution around people, facil-
ities and equipment. Free the area of combustible material within a ten (10) feet radius. Monitor for proper
functioning and disposal of residue. Notify EOD or other qualified personnel when munitions malfunc-
tion.


13. Dispose of expended simulators and smoke pots in accordance with environmental standards and TO
11A-1-60.


14. Fire Protection: Unless otherwise directed by the fire chief, provide a minimum of two serviceable fire
extinguishers, suitable for the hazards involved, for immediate use at any locations where explosives are
being handled.


15. Fire department, Safety office, and Security Forces will be notified of dates, times, and locations of
where munitions will be activated for all on base exercises.
