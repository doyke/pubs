AFI 41-210, 22 March 2006, is supplemented as follows.

This supplement implements AFI 41-210. It establishes local policy, procedures, and
responsibilities for placing uniformed service members on quarters. Users must read this
supplement in conjuction with implemented publications. It applies to uniformed service
members and healthcare providers within the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF). The Chief of
Medical Staff serves as program manager and the focal point for resolving any discrepancies
regarding the use of quarters. This supplement directs collecting and maintaining information
protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 authorized by Title 10 and the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. System of Records Notice F044 AF SG E, Medical
Record System, applies. Each form is subject to the provisions of AFI 33-332, Privacy Act
Program, and required by this regulation, contains a privacy act statement accompanying the
document. Submit an AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication to the OPR to
recommend changes to this publication. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management
of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://my.af.mil/afrims.afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

3.6.1. Quarters will be used for uniformed service members who, for health reasons, need to be
excused from duty for a period of more than 24 hours, but normally less than 72 hours, and do
not require hospitalization. Patients may be placed on quarters when personal illness or injuries
prevent them from performing their duties effectively. Additional uses of quarters may include
those patients receiving medications or specialized treatments that do not warrant hospitalization.
Patients must be essentially independent and able to care for themselves. If some minor
assistance is necessary, it must be nominal and someone should be identified to assist them as
necessary. The patient’s general welfare is of paramount concern. Requirements regarding

meals, a safe environment, and the ability to obtain medical aid if the condition worsens are
primary factors in deciding if the use of quarters is appropriate.

3.6.2.1.1. (MAXWELL) Single members residing alone will not be placed on quarters without
sufficient medical determination that precludes imminent danger to their well being. Providers
desiring to authorize quarters for these individuals should notify the member’s commander.
Members will provide their telephone number to the commander or the first sergeant and the
primary care team.

3.6.2.1.2. (MAXWELL) Providers will make a complete entry on SF 600, Chronological
Record of Medical Care, or SF 603/603A, Chronological Record of Dental Care (both
prescribed by 41 CFR 102-194, Standard and Optional Forms Management Program), to
include duration of quarters authorized. Maxwell AFB Form 16, Quarters Authorization, will be
used to document notification of quarters to commander or designee. The provider will complete
Sections A and C of the Maxwell AFB Form 16. The length of quarters and return to duty
sections are complete and consistent with the SF 600 or 603/603A.

3.6.2.1.3. (MAXWELL) After the provider completes the Maxwell AFB Form 16, Section A,
medical personnel will notify the member’s Commander’s Support Staff (CSS) and complete
Section B of Maxwell AFB Form 16.

3.6.2.1.4. (MAXWELL) The patient will be instructed to follow the instructions outlined in
Section A.1 of Maxwell AFB Form 16.

3.6.2.1.5. (MAXWELL) The first page of Maxwell AFB Form 16 will be filed in the patient’s
medical record and the third page will be given to the patient to take to their CSS. The first two
pages (with diagnosis) will not be provided to anyone outside the MTF.

3.6.2.2. The provider will forward the second page of Maxwell AFB Form 16 to Public Health
for communicable disease tracking when applicable.

3.6.2.3.1. (MAXWELL) If a patient was placed on quarters for 48 or 72 hours, the patient must
be seen by a provider before quarters status can be extended. This is to ensure the member is not
fit for duty and to protect the welfare of the individual in case there may be serious medical
complications.

3.6.2.3.2. (MAXWELL) When the illness exceeds the 72-hour limit, the member must be seen
by a provider and may be placed on an extension of up to 72 hours. If the condition persists
beyond the extension, consider the member for convalescent leave or hospitalization.

3.6.2.3.3. (MAXWELL) Providers may authorize an extension of 24 hours for patients placed
on 24-hour quarters via telephone consultation.

3.6.3. Quarters authorized by a physician assistant or nurse practitioner for longer than 48 hours
must have the concurrence and co-signature of a physician on Maxwell AFB Form 16, Section
A.12.
