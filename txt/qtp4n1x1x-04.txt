                                        INTRODUCTION

1. This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make available a training aid which will
assist Surgical Service Technicians to develop technical skills essential to performing specialized tasks.
The tasks are broken down into teachable elements, which help the trainer guide the trainee into
becoming proficient with the tasks. The QTP will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for
task certification.

2. As a trainer, go through each module (lesson) and identify which QTP tasks are appropriate for the
trainee’s duty position (items identified in the CFETP as core tasks are mandatory), then determine the
order in which you want the trainee to learn about each subject area. Direct the trainee to review the
training references to better understand the objective of each module. Go through the steps in the task
performance with the trainee and allow for enough time to learn each step; some objectives may take
more time than others. Remember, the objective of the QTP is to ensure the trainee can perform each
task thoroughly. When the trainee receives enough training and is ready to be evaluated on an objective,
follow the evaluation instructions. Use the performance checklist as you evaluate each objective. If the
trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document appropriately in the individual’s training
record. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas needing more training until the
objective is met. Conduct a feedback with the trainee on each module. After the trainer has ensured and
documented that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, the trainee should be evaluated by a certifier.

3. The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that
will meet Air Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan
(CFETP). We value your expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have
suggestions for its improvement, or if you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP,
please let us know about them by contacting the below individual.

                                                 personal protective equipment (PPE) required by current
                                                 standards/precautions.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. After the trainee has received instruction, allow sufficient practice on each part of the task. The trainee must
   satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.

3. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished. NOTE:
   The checklist instructs the trainee to start gloving with the right hand; this is primarily for clarity of the checklist,
   it is acceptable to start with either hand as long as proper sequence is maintained.

4. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be documented
   in the Specialty Training Standard (STS). All recurring evaluation should be documented using AF Form 1098,
   Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using an approved substitute record.

7.     Open last fold in same manner as the        Walk around table and repeat
            third                                      procedure to open final fold
                         Open Diagonally Wrapped Stationary Items
1.   Position pack so first flap opens toward walls
2. Open first flap, standing to side to prevent reaching over sterile field.
3. Move to front of pack (your back facing the center of the room).
4. Open the second and third wrapper flaps to the sides
5. Holding third flap with one hand, peel back last flap with other (this helps prevent
   bunching)
                      Open Diagonally Wrapped Hand-Held Items
NOTE: If the item or tray is too heavy to hold in hand, place it on a flat surface and
   open as a stationary item
1. Check external chemical indicator (usually tape) to ensure package has been
   subjected to sterilization process
2. Firmly holding package in one hand, use other hand to remove tape from
   linen/reusable wrapper, or break tape on disposable/paper wrapper

         Open Supplies to Establish/Maintain Sterile Field While Circulating                   SAT        UNSAT
3. Turn package so the first flap opens toward the side (this prevents reaching over the
    sterile item) and open first flap; secure corner of wrapper with the hand that is
    holding the package
4. Turn package so opened flap is facing away from the body; open each of remaining
    flaps in sequence—one side, other side, then flap closest to body-securing the
    corner of each opened flap with the hand holding the package
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the second wrap, ensure the fully opened wrapper flaps are
    secured to form a pouch that covers/encloses the hand holding the item
6. Present the opened item to a sterile team member, or project the item to a solid
    surface on the sterile field if it is fairly light and can safely be done without danger
    of compromising the sterile field
                                     Open Rigid Containers
1. Place container on a firm surface that will allow the sterile team member to reach
    inside container without contaminating self or sterile field.
2. Check external sterilization indicator(s) to ensure container has been subjected to
    sterilization process. If indicators are acceptable, check integrity of all
    seals/safeguards
3. Unfasten top of container by breaking seals and loosening locking mechanism used.
    Verify the locking/sealing mechanism functioned properly and provided a secure
    seal
4. Remove (or open) lid, touching only the external surface. This usually involves
    lifting straight up, touching only the edges or the securing mechanism of the lid,
    then tilting the lid backwards and simultaneously raising it towards the body. If
    container has a hinged lid, it should be opened in a manner that prevents circulator
    from reaching over sterile contents. This usually means the hinged-side of the
    container faces circulator
5. Scrub lifts inner tray straight up and out of container using internal handles. Scrub
    must be careful to touch only inside tray, and must be careful not to allow inner tray
    to touch top edge or outside walls of outer container
                                         Open Peel-Packs
1. Check external and internal (if visible) chemical indicators to ensure package has
    been subjected to sterilization process
2. Identify end of peel-pack designed to be opened and turn package so opening is
    facing upwards; hold package between two hands
3. Grasp one flap (paper side) between thumb/index finger of one hand, grasp other
    flap (plastic side) between thumb/index finger of other hand
4. Maintaining firm grasp on flaps and controlling the item, gently peel back the
    package; do not touch item within the package or allow item to contact edges of
    peel pack. If package tears before opening fully, discard/reprocess item and obtain
    replacement
5. Project item securely onto sterile field, or present to sterile team member. If
    presenting small items such as suture, sterile team member may prefer to use
    instrument to receive item

1. Remove Mayo stand cover from the opened drape pack
2. Read any printed directions on Mayo cover
3. Unfold the Mayo cover (usually a tri-fold) the width of the drape
4. Insert hands under Mayo cover’s cuff with the open-end of the drape facing the Mayo
    stand; securely grasp cover under the cuff at the outer edges, and spread both
    hands/arms the width of the drape to fit the cuff snugly over the hands
5. Hold stand in place by placing a foot on the base; do not let the front of the sterile
    gown touch the Mayo stand
6. Keeping hands inside cuff, place open end of Mayo cover over the Mayo stand tray
    holder as far as the folded drape permits
7. Slide drape over the tray holder and down the stand by unfolding one section at a
    time and advancing the drape as each section is unfolded. Do not permit cover or
    hands to fall below sterile field level
8. Circulator may assist by sliding drape down the stand and unfolding cuff after drape
    is in place
9. Place sterile towel over top of drape; if using sterile Mayo tray, place tray over sterile
    towel (towel helps prevent tears in drape)

                                                impervious bags, protective pads

OBJECTIVE:                                      The trainee will, without error, count items and keep track of any
                                                items added during the procedure. All items must be accounted for
                                                and verified by the scrub and RN after each count is performed with
                                                100% accuracy.

REMARKS/NOTES:                                  This task is performed by the circulator and scrub in the operating
                                                room prior to, during, at the conclusion of, and when deemed
                                                necessary during a surgical procedure. The scrub or circulating
                                                technician assists in counting the sponges in the presence of the RN.
                                                Since this task involves hands-on patient care, ensure the trainee
                                                understands the process, knows inherent risk factors, and is closely
                                                supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will STOP the
                                                procedure immediately and correct the trainee if performance
                                                compromises safety. Ensure the trainee dons all personal protective
                                                equipment (PPE) required by current standards or precautions.



EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. After the trainee has received instruction, allow sufficient practice on each part of the task. The trainee must

                            Perform Counts with OR Nurse (RN)                              SAT       UNSAT
                                 General Counting Guidelines
1. When to count sponges and sharps:
     a. Initially to serve as baseline. Add any opened after initial count
     b. Before closure of any large or deep incision, or body cavity
     c. After closure of any body cavity
     d. Immediately before completion of the surgical procedure
     e. When scrub/circulating personnel are relieved during procedure
     f. Anytime there is a question of a lost counted item
2. When to count instruments:
     a. Initially to serve as baseline. Add any opened after initial count
     b. Before closing any incision/cavity that might contain instrument
     c. At the completion of the surgical procedure
     d. When scrub/circulating personnel are relieved during procedure
     e. Anytime there is a question of a lost counted item
3. All items are counted aloud, simultaneously by scrub & circulator
4. Both scrub and circulator should be able to see each item counted, especially during
     initial and final counts
5. Each sponge, sharp item, and instrument is counted individually
6. Needles in suture packs are counted separately from ―free‖ needles
7. NEVER take counted items from the operating room during the procedure (unless
     for ―flash‖ sterilization)
8. If a counted item is cut or broken, or if multi-part instruments are assembled or
     disassembled on the field, account for all pieces
9. It takes two consecutive correct counts before an ―incorrect‖ count can be considered
     corrected
10. Document all counts per local policy; most facilities use:
     a. AF Form 1864, Perioperative Nursing Record
     b. Locally approved instrument count record
     c. AF Form 765, Hospital Incident Statement, if count is incorrect
                                Specific Procedures-All Counts
1. Keep types/sizes of sponges used to a minimum
2. Ensure all sponges used during a procedure are x-ray detectable (except sponges for
     the skin prep or for dressing sponges)
3. Start counts by counting the sponges
     a. Begin with small sponges such as 4 x 4s or 4 x 8s
     b. Progress to the larger ones (lap sponges)
     c. Do not remove band securing bundles until ready to count them
     d. Completely separate each sponge from the bundle when counting
     e. Number of sponges in a bundle must match standard number
4. After sponges, count sponge-like items (kittners/cottonoids); when counting,
     separate items but do not remove from pin or holder
5. After sponges and sponge-like items, count the sharps

                          Perform Counts with OR Nurse (RN)                                 SAT           UNSAT
    b. Start with swaged-on suture needles, then count ―free‖ needles
    c. Count needles in multiple suture packages per local policy
    d. Count the knife blades next, by type and size
    e. Count electrosurgery tips, then any specialty sharps
6. Count the specialty and miscellaneous items
7. Instruments are normally counted using a count sheet
    a. Count in the order in which they are listed on the sheet
    b. If instrument has several individual parts, each part is identified and counted (1
        retractor frame, 1 moveable arm, 1 handle, etc.)
    c. Discrepancies should be noted on the count sheet.
                       Specific Procedures-Intraoperative Counts
                   NOTE: All previous guidelines and procedures apply
1. Circulator retrieves sponges from kick-buckets
    a. Use forceps, gloves, or both (never bare hands)
    b. Separates the individual sponges by type
2. If large numbers of sponges are used, they may be:
    a. Separated
    b. Counted by the scrub and circulator
    c. Placed, in standard bundle numbers, in bags/sealed containers labeled with the
        type and total number of sponges each contains
3. Once all items off the field are collected and ready for counting the scrub does not
    discard any counted item from the field
4. Scrub and circulator begin counting, starting on the sterile field:
    a. Count each item by type, starting with small sponges
    b. Begin at top of the sterile field, include all sponges in wound or being used;
        ensure count of any sponges on the drapes
    c. Next, count sponges on Mayo tray, then those on the ring stand
    d. Count the sponges on the back table last of all on the sterile field
5. Next, circulator and scrub count soiled sponges off the field; this should result in a
    correct sponge count
6. Repeat count sequence for all counted items until all are counted
7. The circulator notifies surgeon count is correct and documents count

                                   CARE AND HANDLING OF SPECIMENS

                                             PERFORMANCE CHECKLIST
                         Care for Specimens on the Sterile Field                         SAT     UNSAT
                      Handling Tissue Specimens on the Sterile Field
1. Receive specimen from surgeon
    a. Surgeon announces delivery of specimen, description of specimen, and where
         specimen taken from
    b. If surgeon does not provide information, ask
2. Place specimen in a sterile cup/basin
3. Place specimen on back table
4. Remove all attached instruments unless:
    a. Surgeon requests otherwise
    b. Specimen is considered contaminated
5. If routine specimen not immediately passed off field, keep moist
6. Do not pass specimen off sterile field until surgeon gives permission to do so
    (asking for permission is acceptable)
7. If surgeon desires to dissect specimen:
    a. Double-glove surgeon (if desired)
    b. Pass skin knife to surgeon for the dissection
    c. Set up separate sterile field for dissection to reduce chance of contamination
    d. Do not touch/use instruments used for dissection unless they are re-sterilized
    e. Scrub does not touch the separate area after dissection; circulator dons gloves
         and finishes specimen preparation
8. After receiving surgeon’s permission, pass specimen to circulator:
    a. During transfer do not contaminate gloved hand
    b. Do not touch inside of basin or specimen itself if the specimen is considered
         dirty or contaminated
    c. Do not drop specimen directly into a container of solution: the splash
         contaminates
    d. Remove specimens from sponges before passing off the field
    e. Tell circulator what specimen is and where it came from
9. Before receiving specimen from sterile field, circulator:
    a. Dons gloves
    b. Covers area on utility table or stand with towel or drape
    c. Prepares specimen container
    d. If circulator contaminates gloves, circulator should remove gloves before
         touching outside surfaces of the container
10. If any questions about specimen’s identity, scrub/circulator immediately asks
      surgeon
11. If outside of specimen container becomes contaminated, circulator should disinfect
      outside surface before removing container from OR
                          Handling Cultures on the Sterile Field
1. Aerobic cultures are commonly taken using sterile culturette tubes
2. It is important to open, use, receive, and transport without contamination. Two
    common ways to do this:
a. Circulator dons disposable gloves
b.     Circulator peels back wrapper flaps Circulator opens culturette and presents
       and presents top of culturette to        swab to scrub
       scrub

c.   Scrub removes cap/swab assembly; Scrub takes swab only, while circulator
     circulator holds tube inside          holds container
     wrapper
d.   Surgeon takes culture, then hands     Surgeon takes culture swab, then hands
     cap/swab assembly back to scrub       swab back to scrub
e.   Scrub carefully inserts the           Scrub inserts swab; then circulator
     cap/swab assembly back into the       caps/seals container
     tube
f.   After swab returned to tube,
     circulator seals in a small plastic
     bag

                                               PERFORMANCE CHECKLIST
                      Prepare Specimens to Forward to the Laboratory                         SAT     UNSAT
                            General Specimen Handling Guidelines
1.   Routine tissue specimens
      a. Immersed in 10 percent formalin solution
      b. Kept in the surgical suite or taken to pathology lab at end of day
      c. Should be placed in container large enough to ensure complete immersion of
          specimen in formalin solution
2.   Frozen section specimens
      a. Never place in formalin
      b. Are usually placed in dry container
      c. If the surgeon requests, may be placed in saline ("fresh")
      d. Are taken immediately to the pathologist
3.   Stones are placed only in dry container
4.   Foreign bodies
      a. Handle IAW local policies and procedures; most are handled as routine specimen
      b. Bullets and other weapons require special handling to ensure they can be used as
          legal evidence; follow local policy
      c. All are usually sent to laboratory first, lab handles final disposition
5.   Amputated extremities
      a. Large are normally wrapped in plastic bag and taken directly to the hospital
          morgue for storage
      b. Small are usually handled as routine specimens.
6.   Cultures–aerobic and anaerobic
      a. Normally, all cultures sent to lab ASAP after they are taken
      b. If local policy/surgeon directs, may be refrigerated/sent to lab later
      c. Essential to follow specific instructions for individual type of culture involved
      d. Must be collected using aseptic technique, then placed in sterile, leakproof
          containers
      e. Anaerobic culture specimens must be maintained in oxygen deprived atmosphere
      f. Culture swabs must be sealed and culture media must completely cover swab;
          media usually released over swab by squeezing end of tube or firmly pushing top
          of tube until swab enters media
7.   Tissue ―smears‖ (surgeon usually prepares)
      a. Smears of tissue or fluid are usually placed on glass slides
      b. Transferred to lab in dry containers or special slide containers
      c. Papanicolaou (pap) smears are placed in container filled with ether/alcohol
          solution
                              Identifying and recording specimens
1.   Each specimen must be labeled before sent to laboratory
2.   Minimum information on label usually includes:
      a. Name of patient
      b. Last four digits of sponsor’s social security number
      c. Hospital register number
      d. Inpatient unit number, or outpatient clinic
      e. Specimen name/location from which it was taken
3.   Other information routinely included on label:
      a. Patient’s age

                  Prepare Specimens to Forward to the Laboratory                           SAT   UNSAT
    b. Number designation of operating room where specimen was taken
    c. Primary surgeon’s name
    d. Date and time specimen was removed
    e. Urgency of requested tests (routine, elective, or stat)
4. If multiple specimens removed, each is placed in separate labeled container,
numbered in sequence (#1, #2, #3, etc.)
