                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Program Management. This instruction implements policy, assigns responsibility and
establishes procedures for motor vehicle traffic supervision on Little Rock Air Force Base. This
instruction provides additional Air Force specific guidance to complement guidance found in
AFI 31-218(I). The objective of traffic control programs is the safe and efficient flow of
vehicles and pedestrians through reduction of factors contributing to accidents.
1.2. Responsibilities. Installation Defense Force Commander (DFC). The DFC is the
Installation Commander's principal advisor on issues pertaining to the lawful movement of
personnel and traffic. The DFC exercises staff responsibility for directing, regulating and
controlling traffic, and enforcing installation rules pertaining to traffic control. DFCs assist
traffic engineers by performing traffic control studies to gather information on traffic problems
and use patterns.
1.3. Delegation of Authority. Installation commanders may delegate their responsibilities
under this instruction to their vice commanders, mission support group commanders or other
group commanders as appropriate, provided the individual does not occupy a position such as
law enforcement which would constitute a conflict of interest. Commanders should coordinate
letters of delegation through the office of the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA).
     1.3.1. The 19 MSG/CC and 19 MSG/CD are the designated officials for administration of
     this instruction.
LITTLEROCKAFBI31-218 9 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                           5


                                           Chapter 2

                                  DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges. International driver’s licenses are not recognized on
Little Rock AFB, with the exception of foreign national students who are temporarily assigned to
LRAFB for training. All motor vehicle operators will have a valid driver’s license from
Arkansas or their home state, valid vehicle registration, and current insurance on the vehicle
being operated. The use of electronic insurance card is authorized.
2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
   2.2.1. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism, require Installation
   Commanders to develop instructions and guidance that detail stop, inspection, search and
   impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry gates, to include Air Force
   restricted and controlled areas.
   2.2.2. Random Installation Entry/Entry Vehicle Checks. The requirements of this program
   are defined in the 19th Airlift Wing Integrated Defense Plan (IDP) 101-12.
2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath or Urine Tests. This requirement must be outlined as
part of installation newcomers briefings and/or in-processing of newly assigned personnel.
Persons who drive on the installation shall be deemed to have given their consent to evidential
tests for alcohol or other drug content of their blood, breath, or urine when lawfully stopped,
apprehended, or cited for any offense allegedly committed while driving or in physical control of
a motor vehicle on military installations to determine the influence of intoxicants. Unit
Commanders are responsible to brief newly assigned personnel on the Implied Consent
requirements outlined in AFI 31-218(I) and ACTLM 5-65-205. Failure to comply with the
Implied Consent requirement may have the driving privileges suspended or revocated.
2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. In addition to those conditions for
impoundment listed in AFI 31-218(I), local situations may arise that require impoundment. The
determination will be made by the Installation Commander or designee. Installation and unit
commanders must view the abandonment of personal property as a personnel management issue
and be diligent in deterring occurrences. Commanders must include the consequences when
personal property is abandoned during familiarization and indoctrination training into units.
Additionally, measures must be established to ensure personal effects are cleared prior to
personnel departing on permanent change-of-station orders.
   2.4.1. A vehicle will be considered abandoned when the vehicle meets one of the following
   requirements: has major parts missing making it currently immobile, has no current license
   plate, and must have remained at the same location for a period of five or more consecutive
   days. All attempts to locate the owner via ACIC will be completed prior to completing a DD
   Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice. If the vehicle is not removed within 72 hours of
   the time on the abandoned vehicle notice, S2I will process the vehicle for impoundment. The
   19th Logistics Readiness Squadron has been designated by the 19 MSG/CC to tow vehicles
   that have been identified as abandoned on LRAFB and will be towed to the Security Forces
   impound lot. Once impounded, a DD Form 2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report, will be
   completed to include all appropriate boxes marked. A photo of all sides of the vehicle will
   be taken and a blotter entry made. All pertinent facts, conditions, and contents of the vehicle
 6                                          LITTLEROCKAFBI31-218 9 SEPTEMBER 2013


     will be included within the DD Form 2506. All high dollar value items in the vehicle will be
     accounted for on an AF Form 52. Disposition of abandoned vehicles and high dollar value
     items IAW AFI 31-206 Security Forces Investigations Program and DoDM 4160.21,
     Defense Reutilization and Marketing Manual. Ref: AFI 31-218(I)
2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges. The 19 MSG/CC must incorporate
procedures governing suspension and revocation in base publications or as a supplement to this
instruction. Security Forces personnel will follow the administrative due process for suspensions
detailed in AFI 31-218(I).
     2.5.1. Suspensions.
        2.5.1.1. The 19 MSG/CC determines suspension and revocation guidance for non-
        moving violations, as well as what constitutes a non-moving violation on their
        installation (i.e., performing unauthorized repair; failure to register and insure vehicles;
        unauthorized modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc). See
        Attachment 4 for the “Rules of the Road” on Little Rock AFB.
        2.5.1.2. Under age Driving Under the Influence. Any person under the age of 21
        operating or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle with the blood alcohol content
        of 0.02% or higher but less than 0.08% as determined by a chemical test of the underage
        person’s blood, breath or other bodily substance shall be considered DUI IAW ACTLM
        5-65-303.
        2.5.1.3. Any driver cited two times within one year for use of a cell phone without a
        hands-free device will have their driving privileges suspended for at least one year.
     2.5.2. Revocation.
        2.5.2.1. The 19 MSG/CC will immediately revoke driving privileges for a period of not
        less than one year when a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs and the 19
        MSG/CC determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is required to preserve
        public safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel.
        2.5.2.2. A suspension or revocation of driving privileges is a prohibition of operating all
        motor vehicles to include mopeds and scooters under 40cc.
        2.5.2.3. For intoxicated driving cases, the revocation is mandatory on conviction or other
        findings that confirm the charge. These individuals are prohibited from requesting any
        limited privileges.
        2.5.2.4. If multiple suspensions/revocations are imposed, they will run consecutively. In
        cases involving extensions of suspensions/revocations, the date of the new revocation
        will be the effective date of the most recent incident.
        2.5.2.5. In cases involving extensions of revocations, the date of the new revocation will
        be the effective date of the most recent incident.
        2.5.2.6. After consultation with 19 AW/JA commanders direct drug and/or alcohol
        testing within 24 hours of alcohol related incidents or misconduct, and the member
        refuses to provide consent for testing.
        2.5.2.7. Each respective unit commander is responsible for ensuring their member
        attends the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment program (ADAPT)
LITTLEROCKAFBI31-218 9 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                        7


     following any alcohol related incident.       For further information contact the 19
     MDG/Mental Health. Ref: AFI 44-121
     2.5.2.8. For those individuals involved in DWI or DUI incidents, whose civilian driver’s
     license is not suspended, their unit commander may make a written request for on-base
     driving privileges for GOVs only. This request must be coordinated through the
     respective group commander. The written request will then be forwarded to the 19
     MSG/CC or 19 MSG/CD via the 19 SFS/S5R section for final approval. If the request is
     denied, the unit commander may appeal to 19 AW/CC. The request must include
     compelling reasons where there is an extreme hardship and no other workable alternative.
  2.5.3. Rebuttal Hearings
     2.5.3.1. Requests for hearings must be made in writing no later than 14 calendar days
     from the date of the incident or the date the intent letter was issued. Active duty
     personnel and their family members requesting a hearing will submit a memorandum
     outlining the reason for the request and will forward the memorandum to their
     commander for endorsement. The letter must be endorsed by his/her commander. The
     purpose of this endorsement is to ensure commander-level involvement. The commander
     must either concur or non-concur with the hearing request and provide brief justification
     of that decision. Retired personnel or civilians with no military affiliation will be
     allowed to submit their written hearing requests without a commander’s endorsement.
     2.5.3.2. All hearings will be scheduled NLT 14 days after request is received.
     2.5.3.3. Individuals with suspended or revoked driving privileges may request limited
     privileges only in unique and extenuating circumstances, which impact mission
     accomplishment or when the suspension/revocation would cause unusual personal or
     family hardship. Limited privileges will not be granted for personal convenience, i.e., to
     shop at the Commissary or the Main Exchange or for routine appointments. Personnel
     requesting limited driving privileges will submit a memorandum outlining the reason for
     the request and will forward the memorandum to their commander for endorsement.
     Requests must be submitted to the 19 SFS/S5R, who in-turn sends the request and entire
     revocation package to the 19 MSG/CC or 19 MSG/CD for approval/determination. The
     approval authority may deny, grant, or partially grant the request. The approval authority
     will respond to the request in writing, outlining the reason for denial or conditions of
     approval. The requestor should respond to the 19 SFS/S5R and acknowledge receipt for
     the finding within three duty days.
     2.5.3.4. Individuals involved in DWI or DUI incidents, whose civilian driver’s license is
     not suspended, may request limited driving privileges or probation pending adjudication
     or administrative action. The written request will be forwarded through their command
     to the      19 SFS/S5R office. The written request will then be forwarded to 19 MSG/CC
     or 19 MSG/CD for final approval. The request must include compelling reasons where
     there is an extreme hardship and no other workable alternative. The request must also
     cite at least one of the issues outlined in AFI 31-218(I) 2-6.a.(9).

            PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLE OPERATION REQUIREMENTS

3.1. General. The 19 MSG/CC will identify requirements to operate a motor vehicle on the
installation.
     3.1.1. For personnel who violate vehicle registration requirements, or for any other reason
     deemed necessary, the 19 MSG/CC or 19 MSG/CD may suspend base driving or registration
     privileges for up to one year.
3.2. Motorcycles, Motor Scooters and Mopeds. See AFI 91-207, The US Air Force Traffic
Safety Program, for requirements to operate motorcycles, motor scooters and mopeds on AF
installations. Refer to AFI 91-207, para 4.5. for motorcycle training requirements.
     3.2.1. Personal Protection Equipment:
     3.2.2. Head Protection. A helmet, certified to meet current Federal Motor Vehicle Safety
     Standard No. 218 (DOT) or Snell Standard M2005 shall be worn and properly fastened under
     the chin . Commanders may authorize the use of tactical helmets in appropriate off-road
     training or operating environments after completing a Risk Management (RM) evaluation.
     3.2.3. Eye Protection. Goggles, wrap around glasses, or a full-face shield (properly attached
     to helmet) designed to meet or exceed American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
     Standard Z87.1 for impact and shatter resistance will be worn. A windshield does not
     constitute proper eye protection. Host nation equivalent are acceptable if they meet or
     exceed ANSI Standard Z87.1 for impact and shatter resistance.
     3.2.4. Protective Clothing. Wear of long sleeved shirt or jacket, long trousers, and full-
     fingered gloves are required. Gloves should be sturdy, non-slip type to permit a firm grip on
     the controls. Wear of a motorcycle jacket and pants constructed of abrasion resistant
     materials such as leather, Kevlar®, and/or Cordura® containing impact absorbing padding
     are strongly encouraged.
     3.2.5. Foot Protection. Riders will wear sturdy over the ankle footwear that affords
     protection for the feet and ankles (durable athletic shoes that cover the ankles may be worn).
     Sandals, low quarter sneakers and similar footwear will not be used.
     3.2.6. Garment and Motorcycle Visibility. Motorcycle riders will wear a brightly colored
     outer upper garment during the day and a reflective upper garment during the night. Outer
     upper garment shall be visible and not covered. Wearing a backpack is authorized if it has
     high visibility colors/high visibility reflective properties or does not obscure the high
     visibility and reflectivity of the rider’s upper garment.
        3.2.6.1. Garment and Motorcycle Visibility. The following fluorescent colors are some
        examples of colors considered sufficiently vivid in color/reflectivity to ensure increased
        visibility from a distance: bright red, yellow, lime yellow, orange, or lime green. Note:
        Outer garments consisting of fluorescent colors with reflective panels (including
        motorcycle riding leathers with contrasting panels) are acceptable as an upper body

   4.1.2. Radar Detection Devices. The use of radar or laser detection devices is prohibited on
   Air Force Installations.
   4.1.3. Off-road vehicle usage: The 19 MSG/CC determines if and when/where off-road
   vehicles may be operated on base. In many areas, the operation of off-road vehicles is
   unregulated while other jurisdictions have strict requirements concerning age, safety training
   and vehicle equipment. Generally, some "on-street" safety practices such as reflective vests,
   gloves, headlights and goggles may not apply when operating off road in a recreational
   capacity, however, ensure full compliance with local, state requirements.
4.2. Traffic Supervision and Enforcement
   4.2.1. The Traffic plan for Little Rock AFB is contained in Attachment 3.
   4.2.2. The Traffic code for Little Rock AFB is contained in Attachment 4.

   BDOC, VCC, Pass and Registration, and all base entry points.
   4.2.7. The DFC will document and maintain certification and training standards for speed-
   measuring devices in the 19 SFS training section (S3TT). Operators will be certified
   initially, and receive refresher training every 3 years or sooner as deemed necessary by S3TT
   or security forces operations.
4.3. Traffic Accident Investigation.
   4.3.1. Security Forces will respond, when possible, to all on-base accidents reported to the
   BDOC. An initial investigation will be conducted to determine if it is classified as a major or
LITTLEROCKAFBI31-218 9 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                          11


   minor accident. On-duty Security Forces patrolman will make the determination based on
   guidelines set forth in para. 4.3.2. of this instruction.
   4.3.2. Accident investigations will be accomplished in all situations on the installation
   involving a fatality, personal injury, vehicle/property damage estimated at $10,000 or higher,
   or when a vehicle is inoperable and will be categorized as a major vehicle accident. This
   applies to both private and government property.
       4.3.2.1. Upon receipt of a major accident report, on or off-base, Security Forces will
       make the following notifications: Security Forces Police Services, Command Post (only
       when there are suspected injuries), First Sergeant, Fire Department (on-base only and
       when there is suspected injuries), and Safety.
   4.3.3. For minor accidents occurring on the installation not involving injury and/or there is
   only minor damage to all POVs, and all vehicles can be safely and normally driven from the
   scene, the driver must report the accident within 24 hours to the 19 SFS.
   4.3.4. Generally, a detailed accident investigation includes, but is not limited to, an AF Form
   1315, Accident Report, field sketch, scale diagram (if death or serious bodily harm), and
   accident narrative.
4.4. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
   4.4.1. Military members report information to Security Forces if they are on/off base
   resulting in accidents involving injuries or damage to military property. Local guidance will
   capture procedures to accomplish these notifications and the timeframes to report.
   Installation Commanders determine what agencies to notify and for what type of accidents to
   notify them IAW AFMAN 31-116 para 4.3.1. The DFC must develop a local notification
   matrix or other procedures to ensure proper notification of appropriate base and civilian
   agencies are conducted. Develop and publish these notification procedures locally. The
   following agencies will be notified during a minor vehicle accident IAW SF Quick Reaction
   Checklist: SF operations, Command Post, Alert Photo (if needed), Fire Department (if
   needed), Unit First Sergeant, Jacksonville PD if off base. The following agencies will be
   notified during a major vehicle accident IAW SF Quick Reaction Checklist: Traffic
   Investigator, SF operations, SF operations officer, Chief Security Forces, Command Post,
   Fire Department, Alert Photo, Unit Commander and First Sergeants of drivers, Wing Safety,
   and Jacksonville PD if off base.
   4.4.2. Security Forces will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident information
   of military affiliated personnel. Record the information in the Security Forces blotter, along
   with the associated case number from the investigating police agency. When possible, 19
   SFS/S5R will obtain copies of major accident reports prepared by investigating civilian
   police agencies to accompany off-base accident reporting information. Upon request, 19
   SFS/S5R will acquire the accident reports for all accidents occurring off base involving
   military personnel for official uses
   4.4.3. Security Forces respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents (unless local conditions
   or policies prohibit) to accomplish the following:
       4.4.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
       4.4.3.2. Protect personal property.

      4.4.3.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
      4.4.3.5. Conduct a formal investigation.
      4.4.3.6. The DFC (with Installation Commander approval) will develop local response
      and investigative procedures for various types of accidents to include minor vehicle
      accidents IAW AFMAN 31-116 para 4.3.3.6. S/He may delegate this authority to on-
      duty Security Forces supervisory personnel.
   4.4.4. Record accident information in the Security Forces blotter. This information will
   include the accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit (or
   address when civilian not affiliated with military), vehicle description and license
   number(s)/plate. Also, include a brief summary of any damage and circumstances behind or
   causing the accident, as well as any traffic citations issued.
   4.4.5. Investigation conducted by Security Forces and/or AFOSI of any traffic accident will
   take precedence over any other types of investigations relating to the accident. This
   precludes the loss of any potential evidence that may later have to be introduced in any
   criminal/judicial proceedings. (Example: Any safety related investigation and/or any other
   investigation that may hamper accident investigation practices by Security Forces and/or
   AFOSI.)
4.5. Parking.
   4.5.1. Reserved parking sign authority has been delegated to the 19 MSG/CC. All signs will
   be made by 19 CES. Strictly limit the number of reserved parking signs. Temporary free
   standing parking signs for official functions are not authorized on a continuous basis. Sign
   color is engineer grade brown background with 2-inch white letters and mechanically
   fastened to curb face. Reserved parking is approved on a case-by-case basis. Specifications
   and examples authorized on Little Rock AFB include: Wing Commander (19 AW/CC), Vice

   with vehicle in spot will be used for handicap parking and, where multiple spaces are
   together, the number of freestanding signs can be reduced by the use of arrows mounted at
   the top of the sign. Curb signs may be used in conjunction with freestanding signs. Painting
   signs on pavements is discouraged. Van accessible signs will be mounted directly under the
   handicap sign, and sized to compliment the handicap sign it is mounted to. Dimension for a
   handicap signs are: 1 foot by 1 foot 6-inches, letters are 1 1/2 inch upper case and 1 1/2 inch
   lower case, emblem is 7-inches. Arrow sign is 1 foot by 6-inches.
   4.5.2. Use distinctive emblems, decals, stickers, etc, to control parking space assignments
   and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. MAJCOMs (or Installation Commanders if
   not addressed by the MAJCOM) may develop guidance concerning the issue and control of
LITTLEROCKAFBI31-218 9 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                        13

       cited via DD Form 1408. Vehicles remaining for an unreasonable period of time will be
       handled IAW para 2.4. and 2.4.1. of this publication. Security Forces will make every
       attempt to notify the vehicle owner prior to towing a vehicle.
   4.5.4. Parking Warden Program. Through this program unit commanders have the option
   and capability of enforcing parking violations in parking areas they have command authority
   over.
       4.5.4.1. Unit Commanders designate parking wardens for their assigned areas. The letter
       will include the name and rank of the parking warden and what parking area they will
       monitor. These letters will be forwarded to 19 SFS/S5R in building 1255, room 120.
       4.5.4.2. Parking Wardens must be E-5 or above or civilian/NAF equivalent and be
       trained by 19 SFS prior to issuance of a ticket book. To receive training on this
       program, units can contact 19 SFS/S5.
4.6. Off-Installation Traffic Activities. Security Forces utilizes Arkansas Criminal
Information Center (ACIC) to exchange information with local police agencies. When needed
19 SFS/S5R and SF Investigations will obtain and/or release traffic and related incident reports
with local agencies
   4.6.1. BDOC will contact local area police departments each night to ascertain if they have
   any military personnel in custody. This may be done via the Arkansas Criminal Information

                    IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. Standards for Impoundment. On-duty flight will identify any vehicle needing to be
towed for whatever reason (improper parking, abandonment, safety, etc.).
6.2. Procedures for Impoundment. On-duty flight will write a DD FM 1408 for improper
parking, safety, abandonment, etc. or notice a vehicle in the same spot for three or more days.
The on-duty flight will then issue a DD FM 2504/Abandoned Vehicle Notice in triplicate, first
copy on the vehicle, second for patrolman's record, third forwarded to S2I. All attempts to notify
the registered owner will be made at the flight level. If impoundment notifications to the
registered owner fail, the unit First Sergeant will be notified.
   6.2.1. S2I will receive notification via DD FM 2504 and contact the 19 LRS to tow/impound
   the vehicle. A DD FM 2506/Vehicle Impoundment Report will be completed and photos of
   the vehicle will be taken by S2I. Reports will be filed for a total of 120 days prior to
   disposition. A copy of the report will be made available to the 19 LRS for records if needed.
   An SF blotter entry will be made by the on-duty flight. Note: If flight or S2I deems a vehicle
   a safety hazard, it may be impounded to the SF found property/evidence lot for safekeeping.
   Five days must pass, as well as all paperwork completed and notifications made prior to a
   vehicle being impounded off of the installation.
6.3. Disposition of Vehicles After Impoundment. If civilian law enforcement or civilian
government agency request the impoundment of a vehicle by Security Forces, after coordination
with 19 AW/JA and DFC, the vehicle will be moved to the SF impoundment lot for a reasonable
time. If no action is taken by the requesting agency within 120 days, the vehicle will be returned
to the owner.

                                    RULES OF THE ROAD

A4.1. Speed Limits. All speed limits will be determined by the base Traffic Safety Coordinating
Group (TSCG).
A4.1.1. Basic Speed Rule. Although the speed limits are posted throughout the installation, no
person will drive a vehicle at a speed greater than is reasonable and prudent under adverse road
and/or weather conditions.
A4.2. Maximum Lawful Speeds:
   A4.2.1. On base: 35 miles per hour (mph) or as otherwise posted.
   A4.2.2. School zones: 15 mph when signal is flashing and school is in session or when
   children are in the immediate proximity of the roadway.
   A4.2.3. Recreation zones: 15 mph when signal is flashing or softball games are being
   played on the ball fields on Arnold Drive, Sixth Street, or the soccer field on Third Street.
   A4.2.4. Family housing: 15 mph or as posted.
   A4.2.5. Parking areas: 10 mph or as posted.
   A4.2.6. Gravel/Unimproved Roads: 25 mph.
   A4.2.7. Troop formation: Speeds will be reduced to 10 mph, when driving close to or
   passing a troop formation performing training, marching or squadron, group or wing level
   physical fitness training.
   A4.2.8. Excessive Speed Rule: Any individual operating a motor vehicle greater than 20
   mph over the posted speed limit will be subject to suspension of base driving privileges.
   Each violation will be forwarded to the 19 MSG/CC or CD for consideration. Each incident
   will be viewed on a case-by-case basis and suspension may be imposed as directed by the 19
   MSG/CC or CD.
A4.3. Minimum Speed Rule: No person will drive a vehicle at a speed which will slow the
normal and reasonable movement of traffic, except when reduced speed is necessary for safe
operation. On base, the operator of such a slow moving vehicle will yield right-of-way to ensure
no more than four vehicles are being detained.
A4.4. Speed Restrictions: Emergency vehicles when responding to emergency calls and
sounding an audible signal by bell, siren, or exhaust whistle may exceed the speed limits by not
more than 10 mph. This does not relieve drivers of authorized emergency vehicles from the duty
to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons using the street nor will it protect them from
the consequences of a reckless disregard for the safety of others. Note: Use of emergency lights
and sirens does not guarantee the right of way. Personnel who use emergency lights and sirens
must be aware of and prepared to react to vehicles and pedestrians who do not see them or
disregard them.
   A4.4.1. If operators fail to abide by these rules they will be issued a DD Form 1408, Armed
   Forces Traffic Ticket. Registration license plate numbers will be obtained and personnel will
 28                                         LITTLEROCKAFBI31-218 9 SEPTEMBER 2013


   be cited after their code response. All infractions involving volunteer firemen will be
   reported to the appropriate off base fire chiefs for additional actions.
A4.5. Overseas Driver Licenses: The State of Arkansas does not honor international drivers’
licenses; therefore, international driver’s licenses will not be honored on this installation. You
will have 30 days to receive a current driver license from the state of Arkansas or a state of the
driver’s choice.
A4.6. Random Installation Entry/Exit Vehicle Checks (RIEVC). The 19 MSG/CCA office
prepares the monthly RIEVC check sheet for signature by either the 19 AW/CV or 19 MSG/CC.
This check sheet directs the on-duty Security Forces to conduct random, unannounced vehicle
searches at the installation gates.
A4.7. Turning: The driver of a vehicle intending to change direction of travel will:
   A4.7.1. Continuously signal intent to turn either left or right during the last 100 feet traveled
   by the vehicle before turning.
   A4.7.2. U-turns are prohibited on the installation, except for SF patrols enforcing traffic laws
   and emergency response vehicles.
A4.8. Traffic Signals or Devices.
   A4.8.1. No driver of a vehicle will utilize an emergency vehicle device (Kojak light, etc.)
   unless authorized by the DFC.
   A4.8.2. All persons in traffic will comply with orders of police or other emergency response
   personnel acting in an official capacity.
A4.9. Stop Signs and Yield Signs.
   A4.9.1. Except when directed to proceed by a police officer or traffic control signal, a driver
   approaching an intersection controlled by a stop signal will come to a complete stop before
   entering the intersection. If there is a crosswalk or stop line present, the driver will stop prior
   to the crosswalk or stop line. If there is no crosswalk or stop line, then the driver will stop at
   the point nearest the intersection where there is a view of approaching traffic on the
   intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.
   A4.9.2. The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign will come to a complete stop if road
   conditions or other safety concerns are present.
   A4.9.3. The driver of a vehicle entering or crossing a roadway from a private road, alley, fire
   lane, or driveway not marked by a stop or yield sign will yield the right-of-way to all
   approaching vehicles.
A4.10. Passing and Lane Usage.
   A4.10.1. If passing another vehicle traveling in the same direction causes a driver to cross
   over the centerline, it is prohibited except under the following conditions.
   A4.10.2. Passing slow moving, special purpose vehicles such as forklifts and golf carts is
   permitted if done safely and the driver stays within the posted speed limit.
   A4.10.3. No driver will pass another where prohibited by official signs, double yellow line
   or solid white lines.
LITTLEROCKAFBI31-218 9 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                             29


   A4.10.4. No driver will pass another within 100 feet of or while in an intersection.
   A4.10.5. No driver will pass a vehicle stopped to yield right-of-way to a pedestrian,
   regardless of the location.
   A4.10.6. School Bus Passing. When a school bus stops and has its flashers operating, all
   vehicle operators approaching the bus from either direction will bring their vehicle to a full
   stop. If the school bus is receiving or discharging passengers, the operator of any motor
   vehicle will not start up or attempt to pass in either direction until the school bus has finished
   receiving or discharging its passengers and all flashing lights have been turned off.
A4.11. Following Too Closely. The driver of a vehicle will not follow another vehicle closer
than is reasonable or prudent, or without due regard for the speed of such vehicle, traffic, and
conditions of the roadway. Following distances vary with changes in weather and road
conditions. The general rule for a safe following distance, under ideal conditions, is to allow one
car length for every 10 mph you are traveling.
A4.12. Yield Right-of-Way.
   A4.12.1. A vehicle, which is stopped or parked, will not be moved until it can be moved
   with reasonable safety.
   A4.12.2. The driver of a vehicle approaching a 4-way stop must yield the right-of-way to a
   vehicle, which arrived before him/her. When two vehicles approach the 4-way stop at the
   same time, the driver to the right has the right-of-way.
   A4.12.3. Preferential right-of-way at an intersection may be indicated by stop signs or yield
   signs. When stopped, a vehicle driver will yield to another vehicle which has entered the
   intersection or whose approach is close enough to constitute an immediate hazard.
   A4.12.4. Drivers will yield to an authorized emergency vehicle displaying audible or visual
   signals by pulling to the right of the roadway and remaining stopped until the emergency
   vehicle has passed.
   A4.12.5. Pedestrians have right-of-way in all crosswalks. Where traffic control signals are
   not in place or in operation, the driver of any vehicle will yield to pedestrians who are
   crossing the roadway within the marked crosswalk. Do not enter or pass through any portion
   of a crosswalk if a pedestrian is in any portion of the crosswalk.
   A4.12.6. Drivers will yield while backing. Operators of all government vehicles should use
   spotters when available.
       A4.12.6.1. On and around the flight line, ground guides (spotters) are required when
       wheeled vehicles are backed. However, the number of spotters used is determined by
       visibility restrictions (cargo, darkness, etc.). The horn will be sounded before any
       backing is done. Any backward movement will be done only when the movement can be
       done safely.
A4.13. Parking.
   A4.13.1. When on a roadway, no person will stop, park, or leave a vehicle standing, whether
   attended or unattended on the main traveled part of the roadway, when it is practical to stop,
   park, or leave the vehicle off the roadway.
30                                        LITTLEROCKAFBI31-218 9 SEPTEMBER 2013


  A4.13.2. No person will park a vehicle in a location other than a spot designated by a
  painted line.
  A4.13.3. No person shall stop or park a vehicle in front of a public or private driveway,
  within an intersection, within 15 feet of a fire hydrant, on a crosswalk, within 20 feet of a
  crosswalk at an intersection, and within 30 feet upon the approach to any flashing beacon,
  stop sign, or traffic- control signal located at the side of a roadway.
  A4.13.4. No person will stop or park a vehicle on a seeded area unless it is necessary to
  remove the vehicle from the main part of the roadway due to mechanical failure.
  A4.13.5. Trailers of any type, recreational vehicles (RV), or boats may be parked in base
  housing driveways for a period not to exceed 24 hours for cleaning, packing, or moving. At

  the only authorized storage areas for these vehicles. Personnel who are TDY to Little Rock
  Air Force Base will park their RV or boat in the RV parking lot. They will contact 19
  FSS/Outdoor Recreation for proper storage. Exception: Personnel or visitors arriving
  during non-duty hours and staying in billeting will obtain a pass from billeting which will
  allow them to park any of the above mentioned items in the southwestern most corner of the
  parking lot across Arnold Dr. from the Temporary Lodging Facility/Bldg 952. This parking
  is temporary and will only be allowed for the duration of the pass issued by FSS. This pass
  will contain at a minimum the owners name and contact information and will be displayed in
  the windshield or other easily viewable location.
  A4.13.6. Personnel parking on the street in the base family housing area must park on the
  side of the street opposite the sidewalk. Parking must be parallel and within 18 inches of the
