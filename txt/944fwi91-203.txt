af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. This is the initial publication of 944th Fighter Wing Instruction
(944FWI) 91-203.

1. General. Golf carts will provide the 944FW a means to transport personnel and equipment in an
effective method that saves time, money, and benefits our environment. Personnel need to be aware that
golf carts are beneficial to operations, and substantial hazards exist while operating these vehicles. Golf
carts are smaller and present visibility hazards for other Government motor vehicles (GMV) drivers,
braking is limited under loads, the sharp turning radius presents tipping hazards, and there is no collision
or restraint protection for occupants.
2. Safety Requirements:
   2.1. Personnel must be trained and qualified by the 944th Logistics Readiness Vehicle Operations
   Flight (944 LRS/LGRVO), to operate golf carts in the same manner as general and special purpose
   GMVs. Note: Only 944 FW Personnel or other trained Department of Defense (DoD) personnel are
   authorized to operate golf carts. No family members or guests are allowed to operate golf carts.
   2.2. Towing of any equipment with golf carts is prohibited unless the golf cart is specifically
   designed by the manufacturer for towing.
 2                                                                           944FWI91-203 9 APRIL 2009


     2.3. Golf carts will be maintained in serviceable condition. Organizations owning golf carts will
     assign a point of contact for each golf cart.
     2.4. Prior to operating a golf cart, operators will accomplish a serviceability and safety inspection.
     2.5. Do not exceed 15 miles per hour (MPH) under any circumstances, unless the program safety
     equipment has been installed such as mirrors, seat belts and bumpers. The speed limit with safety
     gear is 25 mph.
     2.6. Operators will use hand signals to indicate turns if golf carts are not equipped with turn signals.
        2.6.1. Left Turn hand signal requires you to extend your left arm straight out, and a right turn
        hand signal requires you to extend your left arm at a 90 degree angle upward.
     2.7. Do not overload golf carts, operators can find weight limitations in the Owner’s Manual. The
     number of occupants will not exceed the number of seating positions.
     2.8. Operators are responsible for passengers and equipment. Personnel must keep arms/legs inside
     the vehicle and equipment must be secure while golf carts are in motion.
     2.9. Golf carts can be parked on the flight line in a safe location out of aircraft taxi paths and the
     flow of traffic.
     2.10. All golf carts will be parked parallel to the aircraft and outside aircraft parking spaces.
     2.11. Golf carts will not be operated in covered aircraft parking spaces occupied by an aircraft or
     use spaces as a thoroughfare.
     2.12. Operators must follow vehicle traffic flow patterns and posses a valid flight line driver’s
     competency card.
     2.13. Ensure adequate ventilation exists when charging golf cart batteries. Do not charge batteries
     near flammable material or vapors. Keep sparks and flame-producing objects away from battery
     charging operations.
3. Manufacturer Owner’s Manual. Organizations owning golf carts must follow the manufacturer
owner’s manual on inspection requirements, maintenance procedures, operating instructions and safety
precautions. 944 FW will operate golf carts with common sense to ensure our mission is carried out
safely.
