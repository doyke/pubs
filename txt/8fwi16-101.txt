1. GENERAL INFORMATION.
   1.1. 8th Fighter Wing SERE Operations are responsible for ensuring the program complies
   with Joint Publication 3-50, Personnel Recovery, 05 Jan 2007, USPACOM TASKORD
   5050.08, 18 March 2008, USPACOM INST 0503.1, 08 Sep 08, AFPD 16-13, Survival,
2                                                               8FWI16-101 9 MARCH 2011


    Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE), 1 March 2000, AFI 16-1301 Survival, Evasion,
    Resistance, and Escape Program, 06 Sep 2006, CDRUSPACOM PR Policy Message, 3 Jun
    2004 and USFK 525-40 Personnel Recovery Procedures.
    1.2. This instruction further defines responsibilities and procedures of commanders, with
    regard to implementation and oversight of the Personnel Recovery Mission Software
    (PRMS) program. It establishes procedures and assigns responsibilities for program
    implementation and hierarchy management. This instruction applies to all 8th Fighter Wing
    personnel.
    1.3. This document is derived from a draft parent document developed for PRMS
    Implementation and management throughout the USPACOM AOR.                   For ease of
    implementation this document has further defined the managerial titles to support the Air
    Force structure. Wing and Group Unit Level managers are not identified in the PRMS
    system. The generic term “Unit Manager” applies to both but has distinct hierarchal
    differences. Squadron Level managers are identified merely as “Managers” in the PRMS
    system.
2. PURPOSE
    2.1. This directive provides 8th Fighter Wing guidance for PRMS implementation as
    outlined in Joint Publication 3-50, Personnel Recovery,05 Jan 07, USPACOM TASKORD
    5050.08, USPACOM INST 0503.01, AFI 16-1301 Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape
    (SERE) Operations, 06 Sep 06, and assigns individual responsibilities for Isolated Personnel
    Report (ISOPREP) development, updates, managerial duties, responsibilities and oversight
    requirements.
    2.2. SCOPE: PRMS allows ISOPREP and Evasion Plans of Action (EPA) development,
    storage, update, retrieval and system management by Individuals, Managers, Unit Managers,
    Recovery      Coordinators      and   Component      Managers.    The     PRMS      website
    http://prmsglobal.prms.af.smil.mil/prms215/login/start.aspx is a web-based application
    which supports management of ISOPREP and EPA information. Upon notification of an
    isolating event, the Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC) or equivalent will use PRMS to
    search and immediately access ISOPREP and EPA information to support recovery
    operations. PRMS eliminates the need to forward ISOPREP data (and EPA when developed
    in PRMS) to the Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC) and Personnel Recovery
    Coordination Cell (PRCC) during contingency operations.
3. COMMANDER’S RESPONSIBILITIES:
    3.1. Wing Commander will designate a primary and alternate Wing level PRMS Unit
    Manager. The primary manager must be a SERE Specialist. The alternate manager should be
    a SERE Specialist to the maximum extent possible.
    3.2. Group and Squadron Commanders will:
       3.2.1. Ensure all personnel complete a PRMS ISOPREP in accordance applicable
       guidance and directives.
       3.2.2. Designate a primary, and alternate managers in writing. Units with more than 200
       assigned may have multiple assistant managers. (Appointment Letter example
       Attachment 6)
8FWI16-101 9 MARCH 2011                                                                   3


     3.2.3. Ensure squadron in-processing and out-processing checklists are updated with
     PRMS requirements as well as activation and deactivation of Secure Internet Protocol
     Router (SIPR) accounts as applicable.
4. POLICY AND GUIDANCE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL:
  4.1. INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS ACCOUNT PRIVILEGES:
     4.1.1. Individual can create, import, and edit their own ISOPREPs as well as update
     their password and user profile information.
  4.2. INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS RESPONSIBILITIES:
     4.2.1. All personnel will complete an ISOPREP within 30 calendar days of base in-
     processing if one has not been created within the PRMS system. Mandatory ISOPREP
     fields are outlined in Attachment 8.
     4.2.2. ISOPREPs must be completed on a SECRET computer, and can be accomplished
     in one of the following ways:
        4.2.3.1. An Individual who has a requirement for access to SIPR network can register
        for a PRMS account and complete an ISOPREP through the following secure website
        http://prmsglobal.prms.af.smil.mil/prms215/login/start.aspx
        4.2.3.2. An individual that doesn‟t have a SIPR account can accomplish an ISOPREP
        using one of two methods (1) if the unit has a “stand alone” secret computer the
        member can input data directly onto the DD Form 1833 (PDF Form). File can
        transfer to a secure network computer and imported to the PRMS system. (2) The
        member can complete a “hard copy” DD form 1833 (PDF version) as outlined in
        Attachment 2. The respective PRMS Manager will then manually upload data into
        the PRMS database. This is the least preferred method since it is very time
        consuming and subject to additional errors.
     4.2.4. Individuals will review ISOPREPs every six months. For personnel conducting
     contingency operations the ISOPREP will be reviewed prior to the first mission of the
