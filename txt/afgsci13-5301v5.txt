2.2. Code Handler Certification and Decertification:
   2.2.1. Individuals will not perform alert (to include field phases and training alerts) or code
   handler tasks until they have been properly certified in code handler tasks. Before certifying
   a former code controller as a code handler within the same control group at the same unit,
   comply with EAP-STRAT Volume 16. Before certifying a previous code handler in the
   opposite control group, comply with EAP-STRAT Volume 16.
   2.2.2. Code Handler Certification. The Senior Code Controller (SCC) certifies unit
   personnel whose duties involve the control of code components as officer or enlisted code
   handlers. The SCC or designated alternate may perform certification. The designated
   alternate will be appointed in writing. As a minimum, certification includes a briefing
   covering code handling concepts and a personal interview with the certifying official to
   ensure the provisions of EAP-STRAT Volume 16, are met. Code handler certification and
   decertification will be documented on AFGSC Form 165, Code Handler Certification and
   Training Record. Code component issuing agencies will use these forms or a listing
   prepared from these forms (TEAMS Database) to identify those individuals authorized to
   receipt for and handle code components.
   2.2.3. AFGSC Form 165 Documentation. OSB will maintain an AFGSC Form 165 on each
   code handler assigned to the wing. The form is initiated when the individual begins code
   training at the unit of assignment. Upon completion of initial training, the instructor signs
   and dates Part I of the Code Handlers Certification and Training Record. When all
   prerequisites are completed, the individual and certifying official sign and date Part II of the
   form.
   2.2.4. Decertification. When a code handler's duties no longer require the control and
   handling of code components, the SCC or designated alternate decertifies the individual by
   signing Part III of the AFGSC Form 165 and advises the individual that he or she is no longer
   a code handler. The SCC will ensure the USSTRATCOM CA 613202 COMSEC manager is
   notified that cryptographic access is no longer required. All access to COMSEC, code
   materials, and code components is terminated.
2.3. Code Controller Certification and Decertification:
   2.3.1. Individuals will not perform code controller tasks until they have been properly
   certified. Before certifying a previous code controller in the opposite control group, comply
   with EAP-STRAT Volume 16.
   2.3.2. Code Controller Certification. The Operations Support Squadron (OSS) commander
   (CC) (576 FLTS/CC for 576 FLTS) or, during absences, the Director of Operations (DO),
   certifies their unit personnel whose duties involve the control of code components as code
   controllers. AFGSC code controller certification procedures will include initial codes
   training, an initial WCPS evaluation, a briefing to the SCC covering code controller
   concepts, and a personal interview with the OSS/CC or 576 FLTS/CC to ensure the
   provisions of EAP-STRAT Volume 16 are met. Code controller certification is documented
   on the AFGSC Form 165.
   2.3.3. AFGSC Form 165 Documentation. OSB and 576 FLTS/TEX will maintain an
   AFGSC Form 165 on each code controller assigned to the unit. The form is initiated when
   the code controller selectee begins code controller training. Upon completion of initial

   of all code handler training is the Code Handler JPRL in Table 3.1 Code handler training
   consists of four types: initial, recurring, individual, and special.
   3.4.2. Initial Codes Training. The purpose of initial codes training is to prepare individuals
   for code handler duties. This training is developed and conducted to provide instruction on
   code control procedures contained in this and other associated publications. Individuals must
   successfully complete initial code handler training on all Code Handler JPRL areas in Table
   3.1, before their appointment and certification as code handlers. The SCC will identify
   successful completion of requirements. OSB will document initial training on the AFGSC
   Form 165. Initial training counts as recurring training for the month in which it is completed.
   3.4.3. Recurring Codes Training. The purpose of the code handler recurring codes training
   program is to maintain code handler proficiency and knowledge in code handler concepts and
   procedures. All code handlers receive recurring codes training monthly. Recurring training
   consists of a self-study package, classroom training and testing. The codes self-study
   package will not replace classroom training. Computer Based Training (CBT) methods may
   only be used to replace the self-study package. Recurring training includes new or changed
   concepts and procedures applicable to code handling duties, identified deficiencies, possible
   code compromises, and other areas deemed necessary by the unit and 20 AF/A3NB. Code
   handlers must receive, as a minimum, annual training on all subject areas in Table 3.1
      3.4.3.1. Inactive Status. Individuals who fail to receive training during a given month
      are placed on inactive status at 0001L of the first day of the following month. See
      paragraph 3.9
      3.4.3.2. Glory Trips. When operational unit code handlers are Temporary Duty (TDY)
      to Vandenberg AFB for test launch activities, the parent unit administers monthly
      recurring training and testing prior to team departure. Upon return to the unit, OSB
      conducts monthly recurring training, as necessary, to ensure currency.
   3.4.4. Individual Training. The purpose of individual training is to enhance the individual's
   codes knowledge and proficiency. Individual training is conducted when serious deficiencies
   are identified through observations, evaluations or exam scores. Additionally, the squadron
   commander, OGV, flight commander, OSOT, maintenance training, OSB/TEX, or
   immediate supervisor can recommend individuals for individual training. Individual training
   is conducted under the supervision of an OSB/TEX instructor. OSB/TEX will document
   individual training and retain it for a minimum of 12 months.

         transportation rules, and emphasis on security of code components when an unmanned
         LF is not in normal configuration. Initial codes familiarization training must be
         completed prior to certification. Recurring codes familiarization self-study packages or
         other media format (slide show or video) may be tailored to previous years’
         PCCs/incidents and will cover all other listed requirements.
   3.6.3. Documentation. All personnel, supervisors, and flight chiefs/assistant flight chiefs
   will annotate codes familiarization training and completion of annual self-study packages or
   other media format (slide show or video) in “on the job training” records or locally derived
   computer database or spreadsheet. Retain documentation for at least 12 months.
3.7. Code Controller Training. The purpose of code controller training is to provide each code
controller with the knowledge and proficiency necessary to properly control ICBM code
components. In addition, code controllers are proficient in the use of the WCPS development of
ground, flight, and targeting materials. The basis of all code controller training is the Code
Handler JPRL in Table 3.1, the Code Controller JPRL in Table 3.2, and the TBA (enlisted).
Tasks or subtasks trained by outside agencies may be certified as complete if all requirements
AFGSCI13-5301V5 29 NOVEMBER 2012                                                               17


have been satisfied (e.g., TPC training administered by Current Operations Training). Code
controller training consists of four types: initial, recurring, individual, and special.
   3.7.1. Initial Training. Officer and enlisted code handlers who are selected for code
   controller duties must be decertified as code handlers before entry into code controller
   training. Initial code controller training consists of Code Handler and Controller JPRL
   subject areas. Code controller selectees must complete initial code handler training before
   beginning training on Code Controller JPRL tasks. Initial code controller training will count
   as recurring training for the month in which the controller was certified.
      3.7.1.1. WCPS Training. Control of the WCPS must be maintained at all times. Initial
      WCPS training for non-certified codes controllers will be conducted under the direct
      supervision of at least two certified officer (576 FLTS two certified) code controllers
      (one being an instructor) each of whom is qualified in the task performed. Recurring
      WCPS training may be provided by 1 instructor regardless of rank. Two officer, A/B
      split control is required to be maintained during all training requiring access to the SE
      area. "Hands-on" training is the primary method of instruction for WCPS tasks;
      therefore, make maximum use of test code components and devices. Observation of
      operational tasks will not satisfy "hands-on" requirements for a code controller (see
      paragraph 3.7.2.1).
      3.7.1.2. Certification. Individuals cannot perform operational code controller tasks until
      they have been properly trained and certified in those tasks. Certification should not be
      delayed if tasks cannot be trained due to lack of equipment. Initial training in these tasks
      is accomplished when the equipment becomes available.
      3.7.1.3. For individuals transferring between ICBM bases, credit may be accepted for
      previously trained JPRs that comply with requirements as identified in Paragraph 3.4 The
      losing SCC will provide a Memorandum for Record (MFR) identifying JPR coverage and
      annual expiration date to the gaining SCC. Additionally, the gaining SCC will
      accomplish a MFR waiving the initial training requirement to be placed in the
      individual’s training record.
   3.7.2. Code Controller Recurring Training. The purpose of the code controller recurring
   training program is to maintain code controller proficiency and knowledge in code concepts
   and procedures as well as proficiency in the operation of the WCPS. All code controllers
   receive recurring training monthly. Recurring training consists of a self-study guide,
   classroom training, testing, and WCPS training. It includes new or changed concepts and
   procedures applicable to code controller duties. Code controllers receive annual training on
   all Code Handler/Controller JPRL/TBA subject areas. JPRL/TBA subject areas must be
   covered on the WCPS with the exception of those identified with a NOTE 1, NOTE 5 or
   NOTE 6. The codes self-study package will not replace classroom/WCPS training. The
   trainer(s) conducting the session may be signed off as receiving the recurring monthly
   training.
      3.7.2.1. WCPS Recurring Training. WCPS recurring training will be "hands-on" as
      much as possible. Operational coding requirements may be used for recurring training as
      long as it is done with proper supervision by an OSB/TEX instructor.

       3.7.2.2. Inactive Status. Individuals who fail to complete recurring training during a
       given month are placed in inactive status at 0001L on the first day of the following
       month. See paragraph 3.9
   3.7.3. Individual Training. The purpose of individual training is to enhance the individual's
   codes knowledge and proficiency on the WCPS. Individual training is conducted when
   serious deficiencies are identified through observations, WCPS evaluations or exam scores.
   The senior code controller, Chief, ICBM Codes Operations or Chief, Codes Training can
   recommend code controllers for individual training. Individual training is conducted under
   the supervision of an OSB/TEX instructor. OSB/TEX will document individual training.
       3.7.3.1. Format. The type and extent of training or testing will be determined by the
       codes training officer. The name and date of training will be included in the lesson guide
       for individual training.
   3.7.4. Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The unit commander or operations officer will
   appoint a limited number of SMEs in writing to develop technical documentation, training
   and evaluation materials, and to conduct training and evaluations. OSS/CC or Operations
   Officers forward the memorandum designating individual SMEs to HQ AFGSC/A3IA and
   20 AF/A3NB.
       3.7.4.1. SMEs appointed for new or upgrade systems are not required to accomplish the
       Mission Qualification Training (MQT) they develop; however, they must accomplish
       contractor provided Type 1 training if available.
To maintain certification in new/upgrade specific tasks the SME must complete a recurring
evaluation within 60 calendar days from removal from SME status or 90 calendar days after
system is declared Initial Operationally Capable, whichever is sooner.
       3.7.4.2. The SCC and Chief, Quality Assurance will determine the scope of the recurring
       evaluation or Quality Control Observations (QCO) for each SME. Document the
       recurring evaluation or QCO IAW paragraph 4.6 of this instruction.
   3.7.5. Special Training. When new training requirements are established, each code
   controller is trained and qualified in the task(s). These new tasks are trained within 60 days
   following written notification of the task identification. Code controllers must be WCPS
   certified before performing WCPS tasks unsupervised.
   3.7.6. Code Controller Training Documentation. All JPRL training is documented.
   Documentation identifies specific tasks and date completed. WCPS training is further
   documented by entering a statement such as "WCPS TRAINING" followed by the students'
   names in the remarks section of the applicable WCPS record keeping printout. Initial,
   recurring and individual JPRL training can be documented using AFGSC Form 165 or a
   locally derived computer database or spreadsheet. Retain this documentation for at least 12
   months.
   3.7.7. Training Business Area (TBA). Enlisted Code Controller Training Documentation is
   accomplished using TBA, for each enlisted code controller. After all training is certified on
   the Individual Training Plan (ITP) in TBA and Initial Job Proficiency Requirement List
   (JPRL) Tracking Sheet recurring training begins. Recurring training can be documented
AFGSCI13-5301V5 29 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                  19


   using AFGSC Form 165 or a locally derived computer database or spreadsheet. Retain this
   documentation for at least 12 months.
3.8. Examinations. Examinations are designed to measure attainment of learning objectives
and evaluate the effectiveness of instruction pertinent to code handler and code controller duties.
   3.8.1. Higher Headquarters (HHQ) Exams. HHQ exams will cover the following references
   in EAP-STRAT Volume 16: Handler exams will cover chapters 2-4, 7(576 FLTS exempt),
   13(576 FLTS exempt), 14, 15, and Attachments 4 and 5, while controller exams will cover
   chapters 1-7, 11-15 and all Attachments (576 FLTS exempt chapters 7 and 13, include
   chapter 8). The passing score on higher headquarters exams is 90 percent. Exams will consist
   of 20 multiple-choice questions and will be open book for all code handlers and code
   controllers. The HHQ exams must contain a minimum of one question from each of the
   required chapters and attachments listed above. HQ AFGSC/IG and 20 AF/A3NB will
   collaborate to write and maintain HHQ examinations used during IG inspections and 20 AF
   Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs), as required.
   3.8.2. Unit Exams. The SCC will determine format and content. The passing score for unit
   examinations is 90 percent. All codes specific examinations prepared for use in local
   exercises and one monthly recurring examination each quarter will comply with the
   requirements of higher headquarters exams. An OSB instructor monitors students during
   testing sessions.
   3.8.3. Documentation. Document the date and the results of each individual's exercise
   and/or recurring examination score on the AFGSC Form 165 or a locally designed database.
   Retain scores on certified code handlers/controllers for 12 months.
   3.8.4. Exam Failure. If an individual fails a recurring or higher headquarters codes exam,
   that individual must receive individual training and pass a retest. Individual training and the
   retest need only include those subject areas missed. For unit recurring exam failures and for
   all higher headquarters exam failures, training and retesting are accomplished before
   performing alert, code handler or code controller duties. Code handlers or code controllers
   who cannot be given individual training and retesting immediately after the failure are placed
   on inactive status.
   3.8.5. Exam Credit. Code handlers and controllers who are administered and pass local
   exercise code handler or code controller exams in the format specified by paragraph 3.8.1 or
   a code handler or controller exam during HHQ inspections, may, at the discretion of the
   SCC, be credited with completing testing requirements for the month. Recurring self-study
   guide completion and classroom training are still required for all code handlers and code
   controllers.
   3.8.6. Training Analysis. Analysis of the training program and of individual codes
   proficiency is documented by the Chief, Codes Training and is used to validate training.
3.9. Inactive Status. Code handlers and code controllers who fail to remain qualified IAW the
requirements of this instruction are placed in inactive status. Persons are placed in inactive status
for training, administrative, proficiency, or testing deficiencies (e.g., PRP suspension or
temporary decertification, failure to receive required nuclear surety training, security clearance
withdrawal or demonstrated lack of proficiency in code handler or code controller procedures).
Inactive status is documented in the 20 AF Training and Evaluation Management System
 20                                                  AFGSCI13-5301V5 29 NOVEMBER 2012


(TEAMS). The 576 FLTS does not use TEAMS and may use an appropriate alternative method
for tracking inactive status. Individuals placed in inactive status are not allowed to perform alert
or code handler/code controller duties until the reason for their inactive status has been corrected.
Persons who remain in inactive status for more than six consecutive months are decertified.
   3.9.1. Inactive Status Notification. To ensure inactive code handlers/controllers are not
   scheduled to perform alert or code handler/controller duties, the OSB/TEX Training Officer
   provides appropriate agencies with the names of code handler/controllers placed on inactive
   status for failure to complete codes training.
3.10. Training Folders. Maintain individual training folders for each code controller until
decertification. These folders must include:
      3.10.1. AFGSC Form 165, Code Handler Certification and Training Record.
   3.10.2. Evaluation and training documentation.
   3.10.3. Approval for code control group reassignment, if applicable.
   3.10.4. Documentation of assignment to their current duty.
   3.10.5. Appointment letters (e.g., Instructor, Evaluator) and senior code controller inventory
   letter.

                                          Chapter 4

                         CODE CONTROLLER EVALUATIONS

4.1. Responsibilities:
   4.1.1. The Senior Code Controller. The senior code controller establishes and implements
   the code controller standardization and evaluation program. The overall goal of the
   evaluation program is to provide commanders with meaningful indicators reflecting the
   effectiveness of code controller training and the ability to perform the unit mission. The SCC
   is the final error determination authority based on input from the Chief of Quality Assurance.
   If there is a disagreement on a critical error, OSB/TEX will query the error(s) to 20
   AF/A3NB. The affected controller(s) will not perform unsupervised coding operations until
   OSB/TEX receives a determination from 20 AF/A3NB. 20 AF/A3NB will provide the
   pass/fail scenario and determination to all units.
   4.1.2. Chief of Quality Assurance. The SCC will appoint a Chief of Quality Assurance. The
   Chief of Quality Assurance will be a certified code controller with 6 months minimum
   experience as a code controller and will have one year retainability for appointment. When
   these requirements cannot be met, AFGSC/A3IA via 20 AF/A3NB may grant a waiver on a
   case-by-case basis. The Chief of Quality Assurance validates code controller proficiency by
   conducting initial and recurring controller evaluations and ensures the accuracy of coding
   processes and documentation.
       4.1.2.1. Evaluations. The Chief of Quality Assurance will perform all controller
       evaluations. If the Chief of Quality Assurance is unavailable for an unforeseen reason
       (e.g., emergency leave), units will contact 20 AF/A3NB for guidance.
       4.1.2.2. Controller Status. The Chief of Quality Assurance must continue to meet
       requirements mandated by this instruction to maintain active code controller status. Only
       20 AF/A3NB will perform recurring evaluations of the Chief of Quality Assurance (with
       the exception of the 576 FLTS/TEX).
4.2. Chief, Quality Assurance Evaluator Training and Certification:
   4.2.1. Training. Each OSB/TEX will develop an initial and recurring Chief of Quality
   Assurance Evaluator Training program. Initial training will be completed prior to
   certification. Recurring training is required annually on appropriate evaluator-related JPRL
   areas. As a minimum, this program will cover planning and supervising an evaluation
   program, conducting an evaluation, preparing evaluation scripts, and maintaining evaluation
   records. These tasks are identified in the code controller JPRL. 20 AF/A3NB will provide
   units with additional guidance, as required. Additionally, each Chief of Quality Assurance
   will attend an evaluator course NLT six months after appointment. Evaluator training
   courses completed in another position may be used to fulfill this requirement with the
   concurrence of 20 AF/A3NB.
   4.2.2. Certification. The following establishes the certification process for the Chief, Codes
   Quality Assurance.
AFGSCI13-5301V5 29 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                35


       4.2.2.1. The SCC will certify the Chief, Codes Quality Assurance. Maintain written
       certification/appointment memorandum in the individual's controller folder.
       4.2.2.2. Prior to certification, the current Chief of Quality Assurance will administer a
       recurring evaluation to the incoming Chief of Quality Assurance. Once the SCC is
       satisfied that the Chief of Quality Assurance has completed all training requirements, the
       SCC will certify the new Chief of Quality Assurance.
       4.2.2.3. 20 AF/A3NB will perform recurring evaluations of the Chief of Quality
       Assurance for all units except 576 FLTS to ensure the individual remains qualified for his
       or her duties. 20 AF/A3NB may also observe the Chief of Quality Assurance conducting
       an evaluation during higher headquarters inspection.
       4.2.2.4. The Chief of Quality Assurance must be certified prior to conducting WCPS
       evaluations.
       4.2.2.5. Document certification in the individual's training record and forward a copy to
       20 AF/A3NB. This certification consists of documenting that the individual has
       completed required training and is qualified to perform duties as Chief of Quality
       Assurance. The 576 FLTS/TEX SCC will document every 12 months within the Chief of
       Quality Assurance’s record that an evaluation is not required if the SCC determines the
       appointed Chief of Quality Assurance still meets all proficiency and training
       requirements. Retain documentation for a minimum of 12 months.
4.3. Evaluations. All code controllers will be evaluated within 12 months of their initial
certification evaluation or last recurring evaluation (with the exception of the 576 FLTS/TEX
Chief of Quality Assurance, reference paragraph 4.2.2.5).
   4.3.1. Inactive Status. Any code controller who is not evaluated within the 12-month period
   will be placed on inactive status until a recurring evaluation is conducted. For example, if a
   code controller's initial evaluation was conducted on 5 May 2012, that code controller must
   receive a recurring evaluation no later than midnight of 4 May 2013.
   4.3.2. Evaluation Types. There are three types of evaluations: initial, recurring, and special.
   Job performance task coverage for each evaluation must contain the minimum tasks required
   to meet the objective of the evaluation (i.e., coding an LCP).
       4.3.2.1. Initial Evaluation. An initial evaluation is given upon completion of code
       controller training and required for code controller certification. An initial certification
       evaluation must be modified to "isolate" the controller(s) being certified. The
       controller(s) being certified must direct all actions during the evaluation. The remaining
       controller team member(s) will accomplish all actions as directed and will not receive
       evaluation credit. QCOs (reference paragraph 4.3.2.4) shall not be used for initial
       evaluations.
       4.3.2.2. Recurring Evaluation. A recurring evaluation is a periodic evaluation of a code
       controller designed to determine proficiency and capability to support the mission.
       Recurring evaluations may consist of either an evaluation script or a QCO. It must be
       administered within 12 months of the code controller's initial or last recurring evaluation.
       Recurring evaluations will be conducted on an entire team.
 36                                                 AFGSCI13-5301V5 29 NOVEMBER 2012


       4.3.2.3. Special Evaluation. Special evaluations are given as a result of a Qualification
       Level 3 (Q3) rating. A special evaluation may be a complete evaluation, but at a
       minimum, it must evaluate those tasks that resulted in the unqualified rating. The
       controller(s) being re-evaluated must direct all actions during the evaluation. Any
       remaining controller team member(s) will accomplish all actions as directed and will not
       receive evaluation credit. QCOs shall not be used for special evaluations.
       4.3.2.4. Quality Control Observations (QCOs). QCOs are observations of code
       controllers in the performance of their normal duties to provide additional performance
       feedback to the SCC or satisfy recurring evaluation requirements. For non-recurring
       QCOs, any combination of vault or WCPS operations may be observed and will have an
       in-brief and out-brief. QCOs used to satisfy recurring evaluations must involve a coding
       operation and meet all evaluation requirements, except those specifically referring to
       scripts, listed in paragraphs 4.4 through 4.6 Paragraphs 4.5.1.1., 4.5.2.2., 4.5.3., 4.5.4.
       through 4.5.4.3., 4.5.5.1. through 4.5.5.2, and 4.5.7.2 through 4.5.7.5 do not apply to
       QCOs. The use of QCOs is at the discretion of the senior code controller.
           4.3.2.4.1. QCOs must utilize pre-existing requirements (i.e., scheduled MGS R&R)
           for status presentation. The evaluator must not introduce any simulated status during
           QCOs.
           4.3.2.4.2. QCOs shall utilize only operational codes unless pre-existing coding
           requirements (i.e. scheduled HSEP) require the use of test codes.
           4.3.2.4.3. Termination of a QCO is at the discretion of the evaluator. At a minimum,
           the requirement in paragraph 4.3.2 must be met.
4.4. Evaluation Ratings. Overall evaluation performances are rated by qualification levels.
   4.4.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q1) indicates an evaluatee demonstrated the desired level of
   performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within prescribed
   tolerances. Criteria for a Q1 rating consist of no critical or major errors and three or fewer
   minor errors.
   4.4.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q2) indicates an evaluatee demonstrated the ability to perform
   duties safely, but may need additional training at the discretion of the squadron commander
   or operations officer. Criteria for a Q2 rating consist of no critical errors, two or fewer major
   errors or four or more minor errors.
   4.4.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q3) indicates an evaluatee is unqualified based on an
   unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge. Criteria for a Q3 rating consist of
   one or more critical errors, or three or more major errors.
   4.4.4. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) indicates an evaluatee demonstrated exceptional
   knowledge and performance above the standard. The goal of the exceptionally qualified
   rating is to recognize an evaluation performance considered to be among the top 15% of all
   evaluations.
       4.4.4.1. To be eligible for nomination, an evaluatee must complete all phases of a full-
       check evaluation (including a coding event) and receive a Q1 rating with zero errors
       committed.
AFGSCI13-5301V5 29 NOVEMBER 2012                                                               37


      4.4.4.2. Evaluatees will be nominated to receive the EQ designation on the evaluation
      report based on the discretion of the evaluator.
          4.4.4.2.1. Evaluators will use AFGSC Form 15, REACT EQ Nomination Worksheet,
          for eligible evaluatees to determine whether they should be nominated for the EQ
          designation.
          4.4.4.2.2. The AFGSC Form 15 is only required to be completed following
          evaluations for which an evaluatee is nominated for the EQ designation.
      4.4.4.3. The SCC will review the worksheet for final approval or disapproval.
          4.4.4.3.1. An EQ rating may be awarded to one or all members of the evaluated crew.
          4.4.4.3.2. EQ ratings are not allowed for special-check evaluations.
      4.4.4.4. HHQ evaluators may award an EQ following a full HHQ evaluation.
4.5. Evaluation Conduct:
   4.5.1. Evaluation Preparation. Below are the minimum required preparatory actions; their
   sequence may vary.
      4.5.1.1. The evaluator must prepare and review the selected script and associated
      materials.
      4.5.1.2. The evaluator must initiate a controller evaluation worksheet or locally
      generated worksheet for each code controller to be evaluated.
   4.5.2. Evaluation in-brief. Evaluators conduct an evaluation in-brief to ensure all members
   of the evaluatee controller team, on-duty shift controllers, and support personnel understand
   the rules of engagement. The in-brief sets the environment for the evaluation and must
   clarify the level of support/non-support to be given. The in-brief will cover the following
   areas:
      4.5.2.1. Evaluator-evaluatee relationship.
      4.5.2.2. Methods used to initiate events (e.g., problem cards, telephone calls, real-world
      activity, and equipment indications). All script inputs must be clearly identified as
      exercise inputs.
      4.5.2.3. Responsibilities during equipment operations.
      4.5.2.4. Safety policies.
      4.5.2.5. Responsibilities during actual emergencies, malfunctions, or real-world events.
      4.5.2.6. Status of evaluators in terms of PRP and code-handling restrictions.
      4.5.2.7. Use of test versus operational codes. Test codes should be used as much as
      possible; however, if an operational requirement exists, operational codes may be used in
      a recurring evaluation, if it satisfies the JPR(s) coverage in the script. Operational codes
      will never be used in an initial evaluation. QCOs are conducted in accordance with
      paragraph 4.3.2.4.2
   4.5.3. Conducting the Evaluation. The evaluator will present status in accordance with the
   script, then observe and document the team's response to that status and all actual WCPS
38                                                AFGSCI13-5301V5 29 NOVEMBER 2012


  status. In an evaluation, an agency would not do more than is required by regulation or
  applicable technical order.
     4.5.3.1. Failing to accomplish any required action is always an error or critique item.
     The evaluator should not hesitate to document errors for these incidents--an evaluator
     may document an error for lack of proficiency in performing a task. The degree of error
     is at the discretion of the evaluator's sound professional judgment.
     4.5.3.2. Status Presentation. Each OSB/TEX must develop scripts for use during
     evaluations. OSB/TEX will keep a minimum of 2 initial and 3 recurring scripts on-line.
     These scripts must be technically accurate. Scripts must be a plan for presentation of
     problem sequences and events that specify instructions for the evaluator and identify
     proper code controller team responses. Scripts may contain oral questions. The
     evaluator should follow the script as written unless a deviation is required to provide
     accurate status. Problems that do not lend themselves to sequential operation should be
     avoided, if possible. Units will number and date scripts and individual problem cards, as
     required, to facilitate control and use, and file them in a manner to preclude disclosure to
     team members subject to evaluation. Specific format and level of detail in scripts is at
     unit discretion. Reference paragraph 4.3.2.4.1 for QCO status presentation.
     4.5.3.3. The evaluator will not permit any evaluatee crew errors to evolve into a real-
     world possible code compromise, a possible compromise of TDI technology, a
     procedural violation, WSSR, or TPC violation.
     4.5.3.4. The evaluator will not serve as a member of the two person concept team, nor
     provide control over components or code materials. In the event of an emergency that
     requires the evaluator to serve in this capacity, the evaluation will be immediately
     suspended or terminated.
  4.5.4. Script Content and Design. Procedural entering requirements specified in technical
  orders and other directives must be reasonably apparent. They must not be "masked" in
  order to present a theoretically possible, but improbable, occurrence. "Masking" means using
  one element of status to suppress another element of status to the extent that the second
  element of status is not easily detectable. This does not mean presentation of simultaneous
  problems.
     4.5.4.1. Performance. Scripts can measure performance in non-WCPS duties and WCPS
     operations. WCPS operations can include peacetime or EWO generation scenarios. All
     scripts must involve a WCPS coding action as defined by EAP-STRAT Vol.16.
     4.5.4.2. Script Content. The Chief of Quality Assurance will determine the JPR(s) to be
     covered in each script. However, each script must contain the minimum requirements to
     meet the objective of the task being evaluated (i.e., coding an LCP or LEP, etc.).
         4.5.4.2.1. An initial evaluation must be modified to ‘isolate’ the controller being
         certified. The controller being certified must direct all actions during the evaluation.
         4.5.4.2.2. For evaluations with two non-certified members, members should be of
         opposite control groups and accomplish an individual tasking directly associated with
         their control group. In the event the two non-certified members of the same control
AFGSCI13-5301V5 29 NOVEMBER 2012                                                               39


         group are performing an initial evaluation, each member must perform and direct
         their team in regards to a specific task action associated with their control group.
     4.5.4.3. Script Approval. The SCC must coordinate and approve all WCPS scripts used
     for evaluations. The coordination and approval will be documented. If a script will be
     administered to the SCC, the OSS commander/576 FLTS/CC will approve the script.
  4.5.5. Termination of Evaluations.
     4.5.5.1. Ensure intended task coverage is achieved before terminating an evaluation. The
     script may call for termination at some point short of scenario completion if it is not
     intended to evaluate the remaining requirements. However, do not terminate an
     evaluation until the team has had an opportunity to complete all actions required by the
     script. An evaluation is not normally terminated unless:
         4.5.5.1.1. An evaluatee/evaluator is unable to perform duties due to injury, illness,
         etc.
         4.5.5.1.2. "Real-world" maintenance activity or coding unduly interferes with
         evaluation.
         4.5.5.1.3. HHQ actions preclude completing evaluation.
     4.5.5.2. Use the following verbiage for termination: "Are you satisfied all team actions
     are complete at this time?" When the team answers affirmatively, state, "This terminates
     the evaluation."
     4.5.5.3. Termination of a QCO is at the discretion of the evaluator. At a minimum, the
     requirement in paragraph 4.3.2 must be met.
  4.5.6. Post-evaluation.
     4.5.6.1. Error Determination. Evaluators identify and document incorrect actions and
     responses as errors. Deviations from proper procedures fall into one of three error
     categories: critical, major, or minor.
         4.5.6.1.1. Critical error. A critical error is assessed when an evaluatee fails to act
         correctly and/or in a timely manner, and the error results in, or would result in
         operational mission failure, endangers human life, or results in death. A critical error
         includes:
             4.5.6.1.1.1. A violation of WSSRs pertaining to control and operations of ICBM
             code components.
             4.5.6.1.1.2. A critical code handling violation resulting in the loss of proper
             control, loss, or loss of proper security of an ICBM code component, including
             test code components used for evaluation or inspection purposes.
             4.5.6.1.1.3. A violation of TPC control or no-lone zone requirements.
             4.5.6.1.1.4. Failing to accomplish a critical portion of a task that directly impacts
             the alert status of a launch facility or launch control center, or the proper
             operation or verification of a code component.
             4.5.6.1.1.5. Failing to identify and correct a condition involving improper control
 40                                                    AFGSCI13-5301V5 29 NOVEMBER 2012


                of a code component.
                4.5.6.1.1.6. Failing to identify and correct an incorrectly coded component.
             4.5.6.1.2. Major error. A major error is assessed when an evaluatee fails to act or
             fails to act in a timely manner and the error results in, or would result in, degradation
             to an operational mission, damage to equipment, or failure to maintain optimum
             system configuration, or results in personal injury. A major error includes:
                4.5.6.1.2.1. The inability to complete a task due to a lack of knowledge or
                proficiency.
                4.5.6.1.2.2. An error that would result in equipment damage to a codes-related
                component.
                4.5.6.1.2.3. An error which results when a critical portion of a task is re-
                accomplished when not required, including unnecessary dispatch or loss of
                dispatch or preventing a launch-capable sortie from being placed on alert.
                4.5.6.1.2.4. An error that could result in personal injury.
             4.5.6.1.3. Minor error. Any error affecting code/code handling or control, which
             doesn't constitute a major or critical error.
         4.5.6.2. If OSB/TEX cannot ascertain how to assess an error for an ongoing evaluation
         after querying all required on-base agencies (e.g., OGV, Safety, Missile Maintenance
         Operations Center, etc.), call and initiate a formal request for clarification with 20
         AF/A3NB. The Chief of Quality Assurance will pass all information regarding the error
         and the associated scenario to 20 AF/A3NB who will analyze the information, make a
         final error determination, and respond back to OSB/TEX as soon as possible. The final
         determination will be sent to all units.
      4.5.7. Additional Evaluation Guidance.
         4.5.7.1. 20 AF/A3NB may use on-line unit scripts with associated problem cards or
         QCOs during unit visits.
         4.5.7.2. If a task is not intended to be evaluated (or evaluated again after being
         previously accomplished correctly), brief the task accomplished when the team identifies
         the requirement to accomplish the task.
         4.5.7.3. The evaluator must always provide status that team members would normally
         detect with their senses (e.g., heat, air, smoke, etc.) when it cannot be provided by the
         WCPS or SE support equipment. This may require the use of problem cards or a verbal
         announcement by the evaluator.
         4.5.7.4. Ensure correct WCPS status is presented for briefed tasks.
         4.5.7.5. Unit OSB/TEX will ensure evaluation scripts (on-line and off-line) are rotated
         semi-annually to ensure script content is not compromised. Individual units will
         determine this timeframe. Additionally, the Chief of Quality Assurance will ensure an
         evaluatee controller team is not exposed to the same evaluation script more than once.
4.6. Evaluation Documentation:
AFGSCI13-5301V5 29 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                41


  4.6.1. Evaluation Type. Use the following paragraphs as a guide to document the evaluation
  type.
     4.6.1.1. Use an "I" to record an initial evaluation for code controller certification
     purposes.
     4.6.1.2. Use a "R" to record a recurring evaluation or QCO. A recurring evaluation is a
     periodic evaluation of a team or team member designed to determine proficiency and
     capability.
     4.6.1.3. Use an "S" to record a special evaluation that is a result of a previously failed
     evaluation. This type of special evaluation may be a complete evaluation or may only
     evaluate tasks that resulted in the unqualified rating.
  4.6.2. Corrective Action Worksheets (CAW).
     4.6.2.1. A CAW will be used for all evaluations and QCOs. They will be maintained in
     the individual's training/evaluation records until the individual is permanently decertified
     as a code controller. When retraining is required, the OSB/TEX Training Section will
     receive and maintain copies of the CAW for training purposes. The CAW coordination
     process should be accomplished expeditiously to ensure all individual records are kept
     current. Units will determine individuals involved in the CAW process. Individual
     records must maintain all restriction-related paperwork to include CAWs, restriction
     letters (to include a letter for removal from inactive status), and training documentation.
     Units are required to create a CAW for errors identified during higher headquarters
     inspections/visits.
     4.6.2.2. Ratings of "Q3" will require controllers be placed on inactive status until
     retraining and a special evaluation is accomplished for the errors resulting in the
     unqualified rating. For enlisted controllers, a new training and certification date will be
     entered into TBA (TBA), On-the-Job Training - Continuation Sheet. For officer
     controllers, training records will be annotated to reflect the individual being restricted and
     placed back on active status once a recheck has been completed and passed.
  4.6.3. Deficiency Codes. Deficiency codes are used to best describe why an evaluatee
  committed an error. Use the following as a guide in assigning deficiency codes.
     4.6.3.1. DC01 - Lack of Knowledge. Did not know or unable to discern requirement.
     May be indicated by failure to accomplish a required task/subtask or accomplishing an
     incorrect task/subtask.
     4.6.3.2. DC02 - Lack of Proficiency. Knew the requirement, but experienced difficulty
     because of a skill, ability, or expertise deficiency.
     4.6.3.3. DC03 - Lack of Association. Did not associate the impact of various status.
     Could not correlate information.
     4.6.3.4. DC04 - Lack of Discipline. Inattention to detail; for example, skipped steps,
     misread WCPS indications, or did not detect status. May be indicated by poor checklist
     discipline.
 42                                                AFGSCI13-5301V5 29 NOVEMBER 2012


       4.6.3.5. DC05 - Other. Any identifiable deficiency not otherwise listed. If this code is
       used, a complete description of the cause of the deficiency must be included in the
       remarks.
       4.6.3.6. DC06 - Faulty Prioritization. Accomplished tasks/subtasks, but unnecessarily
       delayed a relatively more urgent task/subtask.
       4.6.3.7. DC07 - Inadequate Team Coordination. May be indicated when one team
       member had incomplete status or when the error was attributable to inadequate use of
       demand-response techniques.
4.7. Deficiency Reporting. When a team has performed normal coding actions (not under
formal evaluation) and procedural deviations/errors are observed or found through a review of
WCPS printouts or configuration records and results in recoding or additional dispatches, the
SCC shall be notified in writing immediately after discovery. The SCC shall determine
corrective actions. Do not document as critical, major, or minor errors, but ensure the notified
agency understands the severity of the deviations and document them as procedural deviations.
This will also apply during HHQ inspections.
AFGSCI13-5301V5 29 NOVEMBER 2012                                                               43


                                           Chapter 5

                     SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE/PROCEDURES

5.1. Radio Checks:
   5.1.1. In addition to the requirements for transporting code components contained in EAP-
   STRAT Volume 16, radio checks will be accomplished by any team transporting code
   components to and from an LF or LCC to the support base.
   5.1.2. Units will require teams couriering/transporting code components off-base (Category
   II) to be radio-equipped and to accomplish radio security checks every 15 minutes with an
   on-base agency (i.e., TCC, MSC).
   5.1.3. Radio security checks are to enhance the security afforded teams transporting code
   components to and from a LF or LCC to the support base.
   5.1.4. Radio checks are not required at the 576 FLTS.
5.2. Vault Guarding Requirements during a Power Loss:
   5.2.1. Units will develop a plan to ensure notification of planned and unplanned commercial
   power losses affecting buildings where a codes vault is located or where code components
   are being stored.
   5.2.2. If a building where a codes vault is located or where code components are stored
   experiences a total power loss the security system, regardless of Uninterruptible Power
   Supply (UPS) status, the vault or area containing code components must be guarded by two
   code controllers until power is restored. When power is restored, a functional check of all
   alarms must be performed.
5.3. WCPS Troubleshooting and Operational Decertification/Certification:
   5.3.1. If a unit OSB/TEX encounters a problem with the WCPS and coding capability is lost
   notify 20 AF/A3NB and USSTRATCOM/J384 immediately. 20 AF/A3NB will keep HQ
   AFGSC/A3IA and HQ AFGSC/SEW apprised of the situation.
   5.3.2. If E-LAB initial troubleshooting fails to resolve the problem, the unit needs to contact
   Boeing via the hotline. If the problem is not resolved via the telephone and it becomes
   apparent Boeing will need to visit the unit to troubleshoot the problem, the following actions
   will be accomplished:
      5.3.2.1. The OSB/TEX will request the unit OG/CC (SQ/CC for 576 FLTS) request
      Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) on-site support from ICBMSS/GFEA with
      coordination from AFGSC/A3I and 20 AF/A3NB.
      5.3.2.2. 509 ICBMSS/GFEA will consult with Boeing and NGMS on what will be
      necessary to troubleshoot the problem (i.e., will uncertified software be needed, etc.) and
      whether WCPS decertification will be required. If decertification is required, GFEA will
      notify ENV to contact HAF AFSEC for approval.
      5.3.2.3. 526 ICBMSG/ENV will prepare the decertification request letter and send to
      HAF AFSEC for action.
44                                              AFGSCI13-5301V5 29 NOVEMBER 2012


     5.3.2.4. HAF AFSEC will prepare the response and send to 526 ICBMSG/ENV as soon
     as possible.
     5.3.2.5. 526 ICBMSG/ENV will provide HAF AFSEC approval/disapproval letter to
     20AF/A3NB for dissemination.
     5.3.2.6. Boeing arrives and WCPS is decertified IAW TO 31X8-2-2-1. Boeing
     troubleshoots problem. Units must ensure to continue appropriate TPC and code handler
     controls for all individual certified components. The ELAB and OSB/TEX personnel
     will repair and maintain control of WCPS IAW TO 31X8-2-2-1 and applicable directives.
     5.3.2.7. Unit will certify the WCPS IAW TO 31X8-2-2-1 and notify HQ AFGSC/A3IA,
     20 AF/A3NB and USSTRATCOM/J384 the WCPS is repaired and operational.
  5.3.3. This process does not cover situations where operational code data is involved or if
  procedures not covered within technical orders are involved or may be required. In these
  instances, 526 ICBMSG/ENV will provide a detailed explanation of what will be required to
  allow HAF AFSEC to ensure appropriate safeguards and protections of operational codes are
  in place before proceeding. This detailed explanation will require coordination with HAF
  AFSEC, 20 AF/A3NB, HQ AFGSC/A3IA, HQ AFGSC/SEW and USSTRATCOM/J384 at a
  minimum.

               GUIDANCE AND CLARIFICATION (G&C) PROCEDURES

6.1. General. Process requests for clarification per Attachment 2 (electronic preferred) on
official unit letterhead to 20 AF/A3NB, 6610 Headquarters Drive, F.E. Warren AFB WY 82005-
5215.     20 AF/A3NB will            coordinate with HQ AFGSC/A3IA and other agencies
(USSTRATCOM/J384, NSA/I831, 526 ICBMSG, Contractor Support, etc.) before sending out
G&C answers. If multiple questions refer to the same subject matter, then multiple questions
may be submitted in one letter. If the questions are not on the same subject matter, then submit
those questions on separate letters.
6.2. G&C Management. 20 AF/A3NB is the USSTRATCOM/J384 and AFGSC/A3IA
delegated OPR to receive, research, coordinate, and prepare official G&C policy and guidance
memorandums. Upon receipt of wing requests for G&C, 20 AF/A3NB will initiate a G&C
teleconference (see paragraph 6.3) with key agencies to jointly develop initial position for reply

6.3. G&C TELCON. 20 AF/A3NB will ensure all G&C is properly coordinated with
USSTRATCOM/J384, NSA/I831, AFGSC/A3IA, AFGSC/SEW, 20 AF, and 526 ICBMSG/CC
to address topic of concern, assess sense of urgency, and recommend initial position for the
formal reply. In order to accomplish coordination,      20 AF/A3NB will establish a dial-in
TELCON. More research may be required following the G&C TELCON.
6.4. HHQ Suspense for Reply to Units. In order to provide a timely reply to units on emerging
codes issues, 20 AF/A3NB will provide formal G&C replies to units on routine issues within 10
duty days after receipt of requests. Possible Code Compromises and Possible Compromises of
TDI Technology will continue to be handled IAW EAP-STRAT Vol 16, Chapter 14. In the
event a topic requires a more immediate sense of urgency, and is not covered through PCC and
PCTT reporting, 20 AF/A3NB will coordinate with leadership to determine required suspense.
6.5. G&C Distribution. All formal ICBM Codes G&C messages/traffic will be distributed to
the following agencies (as a minimum): 90 OSS/OSB, 91 OSS/OSB, 341 OSS/OSB, 576
FLTS/TEX, AFGSC/A3IA, AFGSC/SEW, AFGSC/IGIO, USSTRATCOM/J384, NGAS,
526ICBMSG/CC, NSA/I831, HAF AFSEC/SEWE, and Boeing Huntington Beach.
6.6. Final Authority for ICBM Codes G&C. As CONAUTH for ICBM Codes,
USSTRATCOM/J384 is ultimate authority for G&C determinations per EAP-STRAT Volume
16.
6.7. Inspector General. AFGSC/A3IA, as ICBM Codes functional, will coordinate with
AFGSC/IGIO regarding questions related to ICBM Codes G&C. Also, all IG-identified
potential findings that involve ICBM Codes G&C will be coordinated with AFGSC/A3IA prior
to final error determination. AFGSC/A3IA will engage 20 AF/A3NB and USSTRATCOM/J384
if required.
6.8. Leadership. Each respective agency is responsible for up-channeling ICBM Codes G&C
to their leadership, commanders, and supervisors per their organizations’ requirements.
AFGSC/A3I will receive all ICBM Codes G&C.
