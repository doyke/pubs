  THE INSPECTOR GENERAL (IG)
     COMPLAINT PROGRAM


 The Air Force has a good complaint program. You can get help quickly and fairly by submitting a
complaint or expressing a concern at any level in the IG system and not worry about retribution or
intimidation. The IG Complaint Program is described in AFI 90-301, The Inspector General Complaint
Program. You can go to an IG at any level, but experience has shown that complaints are best resolved by
commanders and supervisors. For this reason, although not required, you're encouraged to discuss your
problem or concern with your immediate supervisor or commander before coming to the IG.
