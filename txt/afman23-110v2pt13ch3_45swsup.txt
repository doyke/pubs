Table 3B8.1. Note 1: (Added) Defense Reutilization & Marketing Office (DRMO). The
DRMO of Air Force organizations, including contractors, will submit request withdrawals from
DRMO using the DRMS web site. Once materials are flagged in DRMS, contact the Base
Supply Customer Service for requisition action. If the withdrawal is for serviceable equipment,
the Air Force organization will provide Base Supply with the stock number, quantity, condition,
and EAID authorization. Serviceable EAID equipment can only be withdrawn by the
appropriate equipment custodian. If the withdrawal is for EAID accountable, unserviceable
equipment, the customer will provide Base Supply with a letter from their commander or
designated representative which states: "I certify this item will not be repaired, is not to fill a
valid authorization, and will not be used for its intended purpose." Items in FSG 84 must be
approved by the Individual Equipment office before they are withdrawn. Procedures for
authorization of contractors to withdraw property from DRMO will be as directed by the
property administrator of the applicable contract.
3.2.3.1. (Added) It is Department of Defense (DOD) policy to satisfy its requirements, to the
maximum extent practicable, through competitive acquisition of commercial items. Instructions
for preparing a commercial item purchase description are found at Attachment 3A-4 and
Attachment 3A-10(Added). The commercial item acquisition procedures specified in the DOD
supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (DFARS) do not prohibit the use of brand
name or equal purchase descriptions on acquisitions estimated to exceed the small purchase
limitation. However, brand name or equal purchase descriptions are to be used only when other
specifications or more detailed descriptions are not feasible. If your requirement can best be
purchased by use of a brand name or equal purchase description, the purchase request must
document why use of the purchase description is appropriate. If your requirement can be
satisfied by a brand name item only, then you must provide a written justification in accordance
with AFI 63-301/AFSPC Sup 1, Air Force Competition Advocacy (see Chapter 3, paragraph 3.5
 4                                   AFMAN23-110V2PT13CH3_45SWSUP 19 APRIL 2010


of this publication). The approval authority for the justification is 45 SW/CV for acquisitions up
to $100,000 and HQ AFSPC/CA for acquisitions over $100,000.
3.2.4. (Added) When contractor organizations have been alerted to provide coverage for a
launch or test; and comparable supply coverage is necessary, submit a formal request in writing
to 45 LRF. If time does not permit a formal request, the Contracting Officer, 45 CONS/LGCBA,
will be contacted and provided with sufficient details to alert the SBSS Contractor. Issue of
launch critical spares for launch standby, testing, cleaning, repair, or modification will be
processed using activity code "C" and demand code "N". These issues will be monitored on the
D23, DIFM listing. DIFM status code "CTE" (no delinquency criteria) may be used to preclude
issued standby items from becoming delinquent.
Table 3D1.1. Note 1: Bench Stock Responsibilities (Customer & LRS/Supply Activity). In
accordance with AFSPC Supplement 1, special levels are not permitted for XB3 items.
Attachment 3B-9, para 3b-9.2. Base Supply will accept the DD Form 1348-6 without an
accompanying AF Form 2005. When the DD Form 1348-6 is submitted alone, card columns 1-
80 format must be completed the same as for AF Form 2005 as applicable. If the request needs
additional information to permit processing, the requestor will be contacted by telephone, fax, or
e-mail.

Attachment 3B-11. (Added) Receipt, Issue, and Control of Hazardous Materials
(HAZMAT). Overview of HAZMAT: Historically, Air Force bases have had difficulty
controlling hazardous materials (HAZMAT). One main reason for this problem is the multiple
procurement options customers have to obtain HAZMAT materials. Quantities of HAZMAT
enter the base via Government Purchase card, contractors CLIN and other means outside of the
Base Supply System making it difficult to determine accurately the amount of HAZMAT in use
on the Air Force Base. These problems, coupled with stringent Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety Health Administration (OSHA) regulations, require the
Air Force to change the way it manages HAZMAT. Legislative and regulatory requirements
being imposed by the Emergency Planning Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and
Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (PPA) as a result of Executive Order 12856, require Air Force
bases to account for all HAZMAT from "cradle to grave."

3B11.1. (Added) Items Classified As Hazardous (HAZMAT). HAZMAT is any material with
an Issue Exception Code (IEX) 9, or M. Basically the items fall into the following groups:

3B11.1.1. (Added) Petroleum products such as oils, grease, lubricants, etc.

3B11.1.2. (Added) Paints.

3B11.1.3. (Added) Certain photographic chemicals.

3B11.1.4. (Added) Adhesives and sealant.

3B11.1.5. (Added) Solvents.

3B11.1.6. (Added) Acids and bases.

Environment Information tracking system (see 45 SW Supplement 1 to Chapter 1).

3B11.3. (Added) Requests for HAZMART are processed and delivered according to the
specified delivery priority and urgency of need indicated. Hazardous materials requested
between 0730 and 1615 hours, Monday through Friday, will be delivered by the HAZMART
Pharmacy personnel. Emergency requests may be submitted and are processed by the Base
Level Supply, After Hours Support office.

3B11.4. (Added) The Base Supply HAZMART Pharmacy is responsible for the issue, receipt,
and control of hazardous materials. According to the 45 SW HAZMART policy letter, all
organizations, which use, handle, or store HAZMAT will be enrolled with the HAZMART Air
Force Approved System. The following are responsibilities of the HAZMART Pharmacy:

3B11.5. (Added) Provide prompt delivery and pick-up of hazardous material, according to the
specified priority, from 0730 to 1615 hours, Monday through Friday (emergency requests will be

approved system. Establish and maintain demand levels.

3B11.7. (Added) Provide accurate Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), with all hazardous
material delivered, unless a current MSDS for the required material is already loaded in the Air
Force approved system.

3B11.8. (Added) Provide an issue/due out release document with each delivery.

Attachment 3B-12. (Added) HAZMAT Customer Responsibilities. The customer will
accomplish the following:

3B12.1. (Added) Enrollment with the HAZMART via Air Force approved system. The
HAZMART will schedule a meeting with your shop, to discuss enrollment program procedures
and specific shop responsibilities.

3B12.2. (Added) Establish a minimum of one primary and two alternate HAZMART Monitors
per each shop/work shift. This will ensure complete coverage during all shift operations.

3B12.2.2. (Added) HAZMART Monitors will serve as the point of contact (POC) between the
HAZMART and the organization or shop. They will sign for all issues or due-out releases when
hazardous material is delivered.

3B12.3. (Added) Prior to purchasing hazardous materials with a Government Purchase card
(GPC) or SF 44, the customer will obtain approval through the Air Force approved system
approval process.

3B12.4. (Added) Maintain no more than a 30-day supply of hazardous materials. Return excess
materials to the HAZMART according to established procedures in the HAZMART Customer's
Guide. The guide also provides guidance for extensions.

3B12.5. (Added) Ensure all residue/containers are non-leaking and safe to handle. The Material
Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) must accompany all turn-ins. The container must be able to
withstand normal handling or the turn-in will be rejected. If the container is not in suitable
condition for turn-in, refer to the HAZMART Customer's Guide for assistance.

3B12.6. (Added) Adding items will be done through the Air Force approved system.

3B12.7. (Added) If you have a MSDS missing, contact Bioenvironmental Engineering Services
(BES) 494-5435 to obtain one.

3B12.8. (Added) Provide a written request to the HAZMART to remove items from the shop
hazardous material approval listing.

3B12.9. (Added) When hazardous material is required which cannot be ordered or purchased
through the HAZMART, (for example: emergency request), the following procedures must be
followed:

3B12.9.1. (Added) If the item is not on the shop's hazardous material approval listing, a BIO
worksheet must be submitted and approved by BES through the Air Force approved system. All
items purchased offsite must be brought to the HAZMART for appropriate bar-coding and entry
into the Air Force approved tracking system.

3B12.9.2. (Added) Material purchased off-site which is already on the shop's hazardous
material approval listing will be brought to the HAZMART for bar-coding and entry into the
EMIS tracking system.

3B12.10. (Added) Compressed Gases: The issue of compressed gases is normally done on an
even exchange basis (one for one). When full cylinders are issued from the HAZMART
Pharmacy, there are 2 yellow DD Forms 1574, Serviceable Tag-Material, attached to the
cylinder. One indicates the stock number for the gas inside ("6830" stock class), and the other
stock number ("8120" stock class) for the cylinder. Since the turn-in of the empty cylinder is an
important part of the exchange process, the following information is provided:
AFMAN23-110V2PT13CH3_45SWSUP 19 APRIL 2010                                                    7


3B12.10.1. (Added) An empty cylinder is defined by Technical Order 42B5-1-2 as one
containing between 5 and 24 PSIG. Remove the DD Form 1574 with the "6830" stock number
which indicates that the gas has been consumed.

3B12.10.2. (Added) Write or stamp "MT" on the DD Form 1574 for the "8120" stock number,
indicating that the cylinder is empty.

3B12.10.3. (Added) Ensure that the correct stock number is on the tag of the empty cylinder
being exchanged. This is especially important on technical oxygen as it comes in cylinders of
200, 220, and 250 cubic feet. To verify that the correct stock number is on the cylinder, check
the shoulder of each cylinder for the ICC number that is stamped in the metal. This number is
used to identify the cubic foot capacity of the cylinder. The following guide is provided:

3B12.10.3.1. (Added) ICC number 1800 is for a 200 cubic foot cylinder, NSN 8120001519758.

3B15.2.4. (Added) In the event minimum buy results in a quantity or unit of issue change, the
due-out document will be cancelled (DOC) with a "BJ" status code.

3B15.2.5. (Added) The original issue request document will be re-input, reflecting the
minimum buy quantity or unit of issue change. Receipt of "BJ" status will serve as notice to the

be adjusted to show this as the valid due-out quantity and is not to be cancelled during due-out
validation or refused as overage upon receipt.

will have to be submitted to base procurement, and signed at the appropriate level (to be
determined by the organizational commander or equivalent). The document will contain the
following statement:

"Authority to procure (quantity) each at a price of $_____ is hereby granted. All factors,
including price, storage facilities, inventory, and future requirements have been considered."

the minimum buy quantity when this is determined to be a constant minimum procurable
quantity.

will be processed for fill or backorder. The customer will be notified by telephone whenever the
request is killed.
