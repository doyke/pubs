This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 11-3, Life Support. The
Inspection Checklist is developed to support Air Force Instruction (AFI) 90-201, Inspector
General Activities, and the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) supplement, inspection
programs. This checklist identifies compliance items that support guidance in the following: law,
executive order, higher headquarters publication (Department of Defense (DoD), Air Force
Manual (AFMAN), etc.) and major command (MAJCOM) publications. It does not apply to Air
National Guard (ANG) or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units. Units can supplement
this publication to add internal compliance items. Ensure that any local policy/guidance,
publications, instructions or supplements are created in accordance with AFI 33-360,
Publications and Forms Management, and the USAFE supplement. This checklist is intended for
inspection use. Send comments and suggested improvements to this publication on AF Form
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to USAFE Command Aircrew Flight
Equipment (HQ USAFE/A3TSL), Unit 3050 Box 15, APO AE 09094-5015. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS): https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMAMRY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Extensive changes in
policies and procedures from the previous edition required a complete revision of this

publication. The update of AFI 90-201 and the USAFE Supplement also are a contributing
factor for this rewrite.


1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection or
assessment. As a minimum, units should use Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI) checklist in
conjunction with the Unit Self-Assessment. The objective is to identify deficiencies that
preclude attainment of required capabilities. Higher headquarters may use this checklist in
whole or part during visits or exercises.
    1.1. Core Compliance Guide Items (CCGI) and Compliance Guide Items (CGI). Items
    identified by functional managers to prioritize command requirements and to allow the
    Inspector General (HQ USAFE/IG) inspectors to assess criticality of deficiencies.
       1.1.1. CCGI. Items identified by HQ USAFE directorates and functional managers as
       key result areas for successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to,
       items where non-compliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost,
       litigation or affect system reliability. These requirements may be mandated by law,
       Executive Order, DoD directive, safety or Air Force and USAFE strategic plans. CCGIs
       are referred to as significant guide items requiring direct IG evaluation. Identify CCGIs
       by using uppercase and bold letters.
       1.1.2. CGI. CGI are areas that require special vigilance and are important to the overall
       performance of the unit. Noncompliance could result in some negative impact on
       mission performance but is not likely to result in injury, unnecessary cost, or litigation.
       Identify CGIs by using standard sentence case.
2. Applicability. All items on this inspection checklist are assigned an applicability code
designating to which type of unit the item applies. Applicability Code 3 designates the following
main operating bases: Aviano, Lakenheath, Mildenhall, Ramstein, and Spangdahlem.
