                                           Chapter 1

                                 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

1.1. Overview. The Headquarters Air Force operational engagement program with senior
leaders of partner nation air forces is commonly known as Operator Engagement Talks (OET).
This program is an instrument by which the USAF builds, sustains, and expands international
relationships that are critical enablers for our air, space and cyberspace forces. The talks are
administered by the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Plans and Requirements (AF/A3/5) on
behalf of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF). The principal for the bilateral OET is the
AF/A3/5 or his/her appointee. The OET provide direct interface between HAF and the
headquarters air force staff of partner nations with discussion in key operational areas of mutual
interest. To maximize the overall effectiveness of this program as an engagement tool, OET
must support the strategic guidance, goals and criteria set forth by the Department of Defense
(DoD), HAF, and Combatant Commanders.
1.2. Strategic Guidance. The DoD, HAF, and Combatant Commanders have outlined goals
and objectives for building lasting relationships with our global partners. Knowledge of the
following is essential to effective international operational level engagements.
   1.2.1. Guidance for Employment of the Force (GEF).
   1.2.2. The Combatant Command Theater Campaign Plan (CCTCP).
   1.2.3. The United States Air Force Global Partnership Strategy (AFGPS).

   1.3.1. The purpose of the OET is to develop, maintain, and enhance mutually beneficial
   operational relationships with partner nations to improve interoperability in air, space, and
   cyberspace.
   1.3.2. The objectives of the OET are to:
       1.3.2.1. Develop, maintain, and enhance USAF senior leader relationships with peer and
       non-peer air forces.
       1.3.2.2. Share air, space, and cyberspace lessons learned to improve interoperability and
       integration.
       1.3.2.3. Strengthen and expand alliances and partnerships.
       1.3.2.4. Explore opportunities for increased partnership engagements, activities, and
       programs.

        1.3.2.6. Enhance partner nation operational capabilities.
        1.3.2.7. OET will not be used as a forum for negotiating international agreements.
        Participants will not make any unilateral commitment to any foreign government or
        international organization (either orally or in writing), tender to a prospective party
        thereto any draft of a proposed international agreement, nor initial or sign an international
        agreement, before obtaining the concurrence of the authorities cited in AFI 51-701,
        Negotiating, Concluding, Reporting, and Maintaining International Agreements.
1.4. Criteria. The OET process and partner nations must meet the following criteria:
     1.4.1. Partner nation must have a headquarters air force-level or equivalent staff.
     1.4.2. Partner nation’s air force must be willing and capable of reciprocating the
     responsibilities of planning and hosting an OET.
     1.4.3. OET must foster mutual commonality, compatibility, and interoperability between
     USAF and the partner nation air force within legal, fiscal, and political boundaries.
     1.4.4. Objectives of the OET must not duplicate or contradict other engagement forums
     already in existence.
     1.4.5. OET must be consistent with the AFCP, CCSP, AFCSP, and AFGPS.
     1.4.6. Evaluation and selection criteria for partner nation participation in OET are outlined in
     Attachment 2.

                                            Chapter 3

                                 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

3.1. Structure.
3.1.1. An OET is typically held every 18 months with a partner nation; however, frequency of
OET is flexible. Factors that may dictate a different frequency include the maturity of the
relationship, partner nation capabilities, partner nation input, relationship between partner nation
and C-NAF/NAF/MAJCOM, type and frequency of other engagement venues, and partner nation
capacity. Conducting C-NAF/NAF or MAJCOM level engagements between OETs is a
consideration for OET intervals exceeding 18 months. Video Teleconferencing (VTC) capability
may be used between OET, if desired.
     3.1.2. Location and responsibility for hosting the OET alternates every other meeting
     between USAF and the partner nation.
     3.1.3. The first OET with a newly selected country will be hosted in the US by the AF/A3/5
     or his/her designee.
     3.1.4. Where feasible, hold OET in conjunction with other USAF forums as a separate
     working group to obtain synergy and reduce costs. Air Senior National Representative
     (ASNR) between USAF and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) is an example.
     3.1.5. The typical OET is a 2-3 day event which may include briefings, discussions, hosted
     dinners, and receptions (subject to availability of funds).
     3.1.6. The typical USAF delegation composition includes the following: Co-chair-A3/5 or
     his/her designated general officer; Senior level C-NAF/NAF and/or MAJCOM representation
     able to speak for their command; A5XX senior leader to represent A5X and provide
     execution oversight; A5XX action officer-responsible for USAF portion of organizing the
     OET; SME/briefers-as appropriate; SAF/IA regional or country desk officer.
     3.1.7. Additional potential USAF attendees include the Air Attaché, other embassy
     representation, and other specialists or stakeholders, as deemed necessary. The partner
     nation delegation will be of similar composition. When building the USAF team, due
     consideration must be given to limiting the number of personnel, so as to not overwhelm the
     partner nation, and to limit unnecessary expenses.
3.2. Management, Planning, and Execution. Regional Plans and Issues Division (AF/A5XX)
performs day-to-day management and administration of OET on behalf of the AF/A3/5.
AF/A5XX will:
     3.2.1. Provide the AF/A3/5 with program status, updates, and recommended program
     changes.
     3.2.2. Draft and coordinate a Terms of Reference (TOR), if agreed to between USAF and
     partner nation’s air force, Attachment 4, to set mutually beneficial objectives for the OET.
     3.2.3. Coordinate with HAF and task appropriate commands with action items and track
     their resolution.
AFI16-117 1 APRIL 2013                                                                         9


  3.2.4. Coordinate with the partner nation Air Attaché or other partner nation designated
  point of contact to set a mutually agreeable date and location for the OET.
  3.2.5. Solicit inputs from the DoD, USAF, and other applicable agencies for topics to be
  discussed with the partner nation and request their SMEs attend and support the OET.
  Request discussion topics, abstracts, and briefings from SMEs selected to brief topics and
  ensure they have been approved for foreign disclosure.
  3.2.6. Finalize an agenda and itinerary for the OET with the partner nation.
  3.2.7. Organize and execute OET. The AF/A3/5 operational budget will be used to fund
  travel for the AF/A3/5 members. Other USAF attendees are normally unit funded.
  3.2.8. Funding for extending official courtesies to the partner nation to include hosted meals
  and reception is governed by DoDI 7250.13, HAF MD 1-6, AFI 65-603, and HOI 65-3.
  Funding requests will be staffed through HAF/RM, SAF/GCA, and AF/CV for approval by
  SAF/AA.
  3.2.9. In coordination with the partner nation, develop minutes of the OET for the co-chairs’
  signature and distribute approved minutes to meeting attendees and other stakeholders.
  3.2.10. Capture and record all mutually agreed upon OET action items for tasking.
  3.2.11. Develop an after action report and assign action items to appropriate USAF
  organization.
  3.2.12. Coordinate with partner nation’s Air Attaché or designated point of contact
  responsible for the status of partner nation’s action item until all action items are complete.

        ENGAGEMENT TALK’S COUNTRY EVALUATION AND SELECTION

A2.1. AF/A3/5 will conduct periodic evaluations of the Operator Engagement Talks (OET) and
the associated countries to comply with changes in strategic direction and to re-focus operational
objectives as the global security environment changes. Program re-evaluation will occur when
there are significant changes in US, DoD and/or USAF strategic directives, DoD and/or USAF
international engagement strategies, five years have elapsed since the last program evaluation, or
when directed. The periodic evaluation will consider the addition of new countries to the
program as well as the removal of established partners.
A2.2. During the course of the evaluation, the AF/A3/5 will solicit country nominations and
supporting justification from Component-MAJCOMs (PACAF and USAFE (includes
AFAFRICA)), NAFs, and C-NAFs (AFCENT, AFNORTH, AFSOUTH) with regional
responsibility to determine the top candidates for final country selection. Some, but not all,
considerations for nominating countries are: Operational capability and capacity; technological
sophistication;        interoperable       communications;        relevance      to       existing
OPLANS/CONPLANS/TCPs/GPS/DES; extent of NAF/C-NAF/Component-MAJCOM
relationship; frequency, type, and quantity of existing engagement forums; AFCP objectives and
priorities; strategic access and influence on US global posture; and desire by nominee to become
an OET partner nation
A2.3. AF/A3/5 will evaluate MAJCOM/NAF/C-NAF nominations for additions or removals
based on strategic directives, USAF operational and policy equities, OET Program criteria, and
available resources. AF/A3/5 will submit a final recommendation to the CSAF for approval.
AF/A5X may convene a board of O-6 representation from, at a minimum, the following
directorates: AF/A3/5, SAF/IA, AF/A8XS and AF/CC POLAD. Other HAF representatives to
the board will be included as required.
A2.4. AF/A3/5 will prepare a formal CSAF letter to the newly selected partner nations and/or
nations removed from the OET program. AF/A5XX will action this discussion with
