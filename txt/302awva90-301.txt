      You can get help quickly and fairly under the Air Force IG Complaints Program, and you can make your
      complaint at any level and no one may take any action against you just because you complained.

      The Inspector General Complaint program also includes Fraud, Waste and Abuse and is described in AFI90-
      301. The instruction tells you how to submit a complaint, and who you should talk to. You may contact the
      Wing Inspector General or any Inspector General at any level. However, experience has shown that
      commanders and supervisors are in the best position to solve complaints. For this reason, you are
      encouraged to discuss your problems with your supervisor or your commander.
