                                            Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This instruction establishes requirements and grading criteria for the CAA
additional aircraft ground and flight phases of initial, requalification and periodic flight
evaluations. Aircrew evaluations will be conducted IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202, Vol 2,
Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program. Specific areas for evaluation are prescribed to
ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of aircrews. Flight examiners
use AFI 11-202, Vol 2, when conducting aircrew evaluations. Instructors use this AFI when
preparing aircrews for qualification.
1.2. Applicability. This instruction applies to all CAA aircrew flying additional aircraft. For
the purposes of this instruction, the term additional aircraft refers to aircraft other than those in
the AFSOC inventory that are leased for periods of 6 months or greater.
1.3. Key Words and Definitions.
   1.3.1. "Will" and "Shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. "Should" is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
   accomplishment.
   1.3.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. "Note" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
   emphasize.
1.4. Waivers. Waiver authority for the contents of this document is Headquarters (HQ)
AFSOC/A3. Waiver requests should be submitted through Major Command (MAJCOM)
Standardization and Evaluation channels to the HQ AFSOC/A3. AFRC waivers will be
requested through Stan/Eval channels to HQ AFRC/A3. Post all waivers IAW AFI 11 202, Vol
2. (T-2).
   1.4.1. Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk.
       1.4.1.1. “Tier 0” (T-0) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance
       is determined and waived by respective non-Air Force authority.
       1.4.1.2. “Tier 1” (T-1) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance
       may put airman, mission, or program strongly at risk, and may only be waived by the
       MAJCOM/CC or delegate with concurrence of publication approver. When multiple
       MAJCOMs are affected, then T-1 is appropriate.
       1.4.1.3. “Tier 2” (T-2) requirements are reserved for requirements that potentially put
       the mission at risk or potentially degrade the mission or program, and may only be
       waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate.
       1.4.1.4. “Tier 3” (T-3) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance
       has a remote risk of mission failure, and may be waived by the Wing/CC but no lower
       than the OG/CC.
1.5. Supplements. Units are encouraged to supplement this instruction with standard evaluation
profiles that best fit the unit’s mission, equipment, and location. Units will forward a copy of
 6                                                    AFSOCI11-219V2 20 NOVEMBER 2013


their supplements to HQ AFSOC/A3, through, HQ AFSOC/A3V for approval. Units below
Group level will forward one copy of each supplement to their respective group OPR for pre-
publication review.
1.6. Evaluation Procedures. Before the aircraft commanders (AC) briefing, the evaluator will
inform the AC of any special requirements. Flight examiners will brief the examinee on the
conduct, purpose, and requirements of the evaluation, as well as all applicable evaluation criteria,
prior to the beginning of flight duties. The examinee will accomplish all required mission
planning. Flight examiners will be furnished a copy of necessary charts, flight logs, mission
folders, and any additional items they deem necessary.
     1.6.1. Flight examiners will ensure all required training and documentation is complete prior
     to initial/requalification evaluations.
     1.6.2. Unless requested by examinee and approved by squadron Director of Operations, the
     examinee will be current for all events evaluated during a periodic evaluation.
     1.6.3. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations,
     but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.
     1.6.4. Under no circumstances will a flight examiner allow the aircraft to slow to below one
     engine inoperative air minimum control speed (Vmca), regardless of airspeed tolerances
     listed for specific areas.
     1.6.5. The flight examiner should not ordinarily occupy a primary crew position during
     evaluations to ensure the most objective evaluation. When conditions warrant, the flight
     examiner may, at his/her discretion, occupy a primary crew position during an evaluation.
     1.6.6. Evaluations will not ordinarily be administered during deployed advisory missions.
     Exception: For situations with extenuating circumstances evaluations may be administered
     by CAA evaluators during deployed advisory missions with concurrence of the examinee and
     the squadron commander.
     1.6.7. Flight examiners will thoroughly debrief/critique all aspects of the flight. During the
     critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations,
     area/subarea grades assigned, and any additional training required.
1.7. Grading Instructions. All evaluations will follow the guidelines established in AFI 11202,
Vol 2, and this volume. Flight examiners will use the AFSOC Form 48, Flight Evaluations, for
their respective crew positions while performing the flight evaluation. Examiners will use the
criteria contained in this volume to accomplish all flight, simulator, and emergency procedures
evaluations. To ensure standard and objective evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly
familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria.
     1.7.1. Area/Subarea Grades. Areas/subareas will have a two-level (Q/U) or three-level
     (Q/Q-/U) grading system. Discrepancies will be documented against the listed subareas.
        1.7.1.1. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a satisfactory
        knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
        tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
        1.7.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
        tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner.
AFSOCI11-219V2 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   7


       Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances or
       jeopardize flight safety.
       1.7.1.3. U indicates a breach of flight discipline, performance outside allowable
       parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely affected
       mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee receiving an
       area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in the judgment of
       the flight examiner, additional training will not constructively improve examinee’s
       performance, it is not required. In this case, the flight examiner must thoroughly debrief
       the examinee.
   1.7.2. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew
   member in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. If an aircrew member
   receives an unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will
   also be unqualified. Critical areas are identified by (Critical) in the area title and by shading
   of the Q- block on the appropriate AFSOC Form 48 series.
1.8. Evaluation Requirements. Evaluation profiles will reflect a sampling of the unit’s
missions. Evaluation tables are provided to summarize evaluation areas. Areas common to all
crew members are contained in Table 2.1. Instructor evaluation areas are in Table 3.1.
Evaluation areas unique to each crew position are located in their respective chapter. Each crew
specific chapter defines required events. Evaluation methods are identified by notes in the crew
specific tables and include: in-flight only; in-flight and/or in simulator (see Paragraph 1.8.1);
and in-flight and/or alternate methods (see Paragraph 1.8.2). For areas without a note, flight
examiners may evaluate at their discretion if observed. If required events are not observed, then
the evaluation is incomplete and will be accomplished on another flight.
   1.8.1. Simulator. Simulators may be used to accomplish evaluations if certified by
   HQ AFSOC/A3T and HQ AFSOC/A3V. Simulator certifications can be located at the HQ
   AFSOC/A3T website. Do not conduct two consecutive evaluations in the simulator.
   Exception: Instrument (INSTM) evaluations.
       1.8.1.1. If an area/subarea was not able to be evaluated in-flight, and the event is
       certified for evaluation purposes in the simulator, it can be evaluated in the simulator to
       complete the evaluation. Document in the comments section of AF Form 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Training, which portion(s) of evaluation were conducted in simulator.
   1.8.2. Alternate Method. When it is impossible to evaluate an area in-flight due to
   equipment malfunctions, operational requirements, scheduling restrictions, or weather, the
   area may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., procedural trainer, or verbal
   examination). If, in the flight examiner’s judgment, an item cannot be adequately evaluated
   by an alternate method, complete the evaluation on an additional flight.
   1.8.3. Grading Criteria. To the maximum extent possible, flight examiners will use the
   grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area grades. Exercise judgment when
   the wording of areas is subjective and when specific areas are not covered. Flight examiner
   judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade. Consider cumulative
   deviations when determining the overall grade.
 8                                                     AFSOCI11-219V2 20 NOVEMBER 2013


        1.8.3.1. Base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable
        aircraft. In some cases, momentary deviations are allowable provided the examinee
        applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize safety.
1.9. Unsatisfactory Performance. If the flight examiner observes an aircrew counterpart
jeopardizing safety, the examiner will assume the duties of that aircrew member (provided the
examiner’s Flight Duty Period (FDP) does not exceed AFI 11-202, Vol 3, General Flight Rules,
maximum FDP for an un-augmented crew). This does not mean the examiner must assume the
examinee’s position any time unsatisfactory performance is observed. If the examiner feels the
examinee can continue safely with supervision, the examiner is not required to assume the
examinee’s duties. However, if the flight examiner assumes the examinee’s duties, assign a
Qualification Level 3 (Q-3) as the overall grade.
     1.9.1. Evaluators     must   report    deviations/discrepancies   from     established
     procedures/directives in any area, regardless of the individual’s crew specialty, to
     squadron/group commander, along with evaluator’s recommendation for corrective action,
     IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2.
1.10. Additional Training. Flight examiners are responsible for assigning additional training,
at their discretion. Document additional training and completion IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2. Any
approved training device or medium may be used for additional training.
     1.10.1. Additional training may be accomplished on the same flight as the evaluation,
     provided the unique situation presents a valuable training opportunity (i.e., crosswind
     landings), and the discrepancy requiring the additional training will not result in overall Q-3
     evaluation. This option requires flight examiner discretion and judicious application. The
     examinee must be informed when the additional training begins and ends.
1.11. Rechecks. Rechecks will normally be administered by a flight examiner other than the
one who administered the original evaluation.
1.12. Special Qualifications. Special qualification evaluations are administered for events that
are not universal to all members in that crew position. Special qualification evaluations may be
conducted separately or in conjunction with the qualification/mission evaluations. After
qualification, areas can be graded as part of a periodic mission evaluation. There are no
requisites for special qualification evaluations unless specified. Refer to the appropriate crew
position for any special qualification evaluation requirements.
1.13. Multiple Qualification.
     1.13.1. Evaluations. If it is determined that variants of like aircraft possess enough
     similarities multiple evaluations are not required. HQ AFSOC/A3V (HQ AFRC/A3 for
     reserve units) must approve consolidation of multiple mission design series (MDS). (T-2)
     1.13.2. Pilots will not maintain qualification in more than two aircraft (HQ AFSOC/A3V is
     the approval authority for multi-qualification in two aircraft). Exception: Unit, Group and
     Higher Headquarters (HHQ) evaluator pilots will not maintain qualification in more than
     three aircraft (HQ AFSOC/A3 is the approval authority for three aircraft). At no time will
     CAA pilots maintain qualification in more than three aircraft. If mission dictates that a CAA
     pilot requires qualification in a fourth aircraft, administer a commander-directed downgrade
     to the pilot in one of their current 3 aircraft prior to upgrading in the fourth. (T-2)
AFSOCI11-219V2 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   9


   1.13.3. Other aircrew members will not maintain qualification in more than three aircraft
   (HQ AFSOC/A3V [HQ AFRC/A3 for reserve units] is approval authority for multi-
   qualification). Exception: Unit, Group and HHQ evaluators will not maintain qualification
   in more than four aircraft (HQ AFSOC/A3 is approval authority for four aircraft). See Air
   Force Special Operations Command Instruction (AFSOCI) 11-219, Vol 1, Additional
   Aircraft Training, for further guidance. At no time will CAA aircrew (non-pilot) maintain
   qualification in more than four aircraft. If mission dictates that a CAA aircrew member (non-
   pilot) requires qualification in a fifth aircraft, administer a commander-directed downgrade to
   the aircrew (non-pilot) in one of their current 4 aircraft prior to upgrading in the fifth. (T-2)
   1.13.4. A multi-qualification letter will be forwarded to HQ AFSOC/A3V [HQ AFRC/A3
   for reserve units] through Standardization/Evaluation channels semiannually for review and
   approval.
1.14. Initial Cadre. Initial cadre will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2. (T-2)

                                    ALL EVALUATIONS

2.1. General. The general grading criteria contained in this chapter applies to all crew positions
and all evaluations. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform required
duties safely and effectively. This includes appropriate aircraft systems operation IAW
applicable technical orders, flight manuals, instructions, and directives.
2.2. Requirements. Evaluate all crew members on areas listed in Table 2.1.
   2.2.1. Examinations. All crew members will complete open and closed book examinations
   as a requisite to periodic evaluations IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2. Written evaluations will be a
   prerequisite for an initial cadre evaluation.
   2.2.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). An EPE is a requisite for all Qualification
   (QUAL) and Mission (MSN) evaluations except special mission evaluations. EPEs may be
   conducted verbally, in-flight, in a simulator, or by another method determined by the
   examiner or unit stan/eval. EPEs should be scenario driven, and tailored to the specific crew
   position. The EPE will include areas commensurate with the examinee’s qualification and
   experience level. Examiners should include other general knowledge areas as well. For
   mission evaluations, evaluate mission-specific equipment and situations. EPEs should
   include sufficient in-flight and ground emergencies to evaluate the examinee’s knowledge of
   systems and procedures to the flight examiner’s satisfaction.
       2.2.2.1. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in-flight. The
       examinee must, without reference to publications, be able to recite/write the proper
       emergency boldface actions in the correct sequence to the satisfaction of the evaluator
       (not necessarily a verbatim response). Boldface will be extracted from respective aircraft
       flight manuals and published in checklist format. Depending on type of aircraft, there
       may not be boldface procedures for all crew positions.
       2.2.2.2. Grading criteria for EPE are outlined in Area 5 of General Grading Areas.
   2.2.3. Publications Check. Required for all QUAL or combined QUAL/MSN evaluations as
   outlined in Area 12 of General Grading Areas.
   2.2.4. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). In accordance with AFI 11-290,
   Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, crew resource management skills
   will be evaluated during initial and periodic evaluations. CRM skills are integral to all
   phases of flight; therefore no specific area titled CRM exists. CRM skills are imbedded
   within specific grading criteria (mission planning, airmanship/situational awareness, crew
   coordination, communication, risk management/decision making, task management, and
   briefing/debriefing) and will include all of the skills listed on the AF Form 4031, CRM Skills
   Criteria Training/Evaluation Form. Therefore, use of the AF Form 4031 is unnecessary for
   evaluations.

3.1. General. The instructor grading criteria apply to initial, requalification, and all periodic
instructor evaluations. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to instruct in a safe and
effective manner. It is assumed that all CAA aircrew are instructor qualified. CAA aircrew who
are not instructor qualified are expected to reach instructor qualification prior to advising foreign
aircrew.
3.2. Requirements. Evaluate instructors on areas listed in Table 3.1. Instructor candidates
must be qualified in all areas they will instruct. Initial instructor evaluations may be a stand-
alone evaluation or accomplished in conjunction with a periodic qualification/mission
evaluations.     Accomplish periodic instructor evaluations in conjunction with periodic
qualification/mission evaluations IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2. If able, evaluate instructor candidates
instructing actual students. Otherwise, the flight examiner (preferred) or other aircrew member
may act as the student. A requalification instructor evaluation is required anytime an instructor
is unqualified for any reason to include commander-directed downgrades.                 Instructor
requalification evaluations may be combined with the basic requalification evaluation.
   3.2.1. There are no requisites for initial instructor evaluations. Requisites for periodic
   evaluations administered to qualified instructors will be completed IAW the requirements for
   the type of evaluation (QUAL/INSTM/MSN) being administered.
3.3. INSTM. Instrument instructor evaluations must be accomplished in an aircraft possessing
adequate instrumentation IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3. INSTM evaluation requirements are listed in
AFI 11-202, Vol 2, and this instruction.
   3.3.1. Initial/Requalification. Evaluate instructor candidates on instructor performance
   during a representative sample of unit’s basic maneuvers. The examiner will act as a student
   during maneuvers that are considered high risk.
       3.3.1.1. Evaluate instructor pilot candidate’s instructional ability during a representative
       sample of emergency and instrument procedures.
   3.3.2. Periodic. Qualified instructors will be evaluated to instructor standards during all
   periodic evaluations.
3.4. QUAL. Qualification instructor evaluations will be accomplished in all aircraft in which
the aircrew member maintains instructor qualification.
   3.4.1. Initial/Requalification. Evaluate instructor candidates on instructor performance
   during a representative sample of unit’s basic maneuvers. The examiner will act as a student
   during maneuvers that are considered high risk.
       3.4.1.1. Evaluate instructor pilot candidate’s instructional ability during a representative
       sample of emergency and qualification procedures. Also, instructor pilot candidates must
       demonstrate each type of landing applicable to the aircraft from the instructor position.
   3.4.2. Periodic. Qualified instructors will be evaluated to instructor standards during all
   periodic evaluations.

                             PILOT/COPILOT EVALUATIONS

4.1. General. All pilots and copilots require an INSTM and QUAL evaluation. MSN qualified
pilots/copilots require a separate MSN evaluation. Copilots will be evaluated to the same area
standards as pilots unless specified otherwise. Copilot crew coordination will not include duties
and responsibilities expected of an AC. Instructors will demonstrate instructor duties on all
periodic evaluations.
   4.1.1. Pilots will receive evaluations in all additional aircraft they are qualified in IAW
   AFI 11202, Vol 2.
4.2. Requirements. Refer to Chapter 2 for general and Chapter 3 for instructor grading areas
and criteria. Pilot/copilot required areas and criteria follow in this chapter.
4.3. INSTM. See Table 4.1 for required INSTM evaluation areas. Instrument evaluations must
be accomplished in an aircraft possessing adequate instrumentation IAW AFI 11202, Vol 3.
Requisites (prerequisites for initial/requalification evaluations) include instrument examination.
The INSTM evaluation will be conducted in-flight or in an approved simulator.
   4.3.1. The evaluation profile will include: one precision approach, one non-precision
   approach; holding or procedure turn; circling pattern; and simulated engine-out instrument
   approach and missed approach/go-around.
   4.3.2. If navigation flight instrumentation does not allow for the required number of
   approaches (i.e., Instrument Landing System (ILS), Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), etc.)
   the AF Form 8 will state, for example, “TACAN approach not performed due to
   incompatible instrumentation.”
4.4. QUAL. See Table 4.1 for required QUAL evaluation areas. Requisites (prerequisites for
initial/requalification evaluations) include qualification open and closed book examinations,
EPE, and BOLDFACE examination. This evaluation is normally accomplished in combination
with an instrument evaluation. The QUAL evaluation will be conducted in-flight or in an
approved simulator.
   4.4.1. The evaluation profile will include: Visual Flight Rules (VFR) pattern; takeoffs and
   various flap configuration landings consistent with the respective flight manual (only
   ACs/first pilots/instructors will accomplish 0% flap landings); touch-and-go procedures;
   simulated engine-out go-around, and simulated engine-out landing.
       4.4.1.1. Copilot. Evaluate appropriate areas from the right seat.
       4.4.1.2. First pilot. Evaluate appropriate areas from the left seat. Pilots who are
       maximum effort qualified will accomplish a max effort takeoff and landing. In addition,
       one takeoff and landing will be accomplished from right seat.
       4.4.1.3. AC. Evaluate appropriate areas from the left seat.
4.5. MSN. See Table 4.2 for MSN evaluation areas and subparagraphs below for requirements.
Requisites (prerequisites for initial/requalification evaluations) include mission open and closed
book examinations and EPE.
 24                                                 AFSOCI11-219V2 20 NOVEMBER 2013


   4.5.1. Initial/Requalification. The evaluation profile will include a minimum of 30 minutes
   of NVG low-level to a time on target (TOT)/time of arrival (TOA); tactical recovery (non-
   self-contained approach (SCA)); SCA; a maximum effort takeoff and landing (see
   Paragraph 4.5.3); threat reaction; NVG takeoff and landing and a Computed Airdrop
   Release Point (CARP) airdrop (actual or Simulated Airdrop Training Bundle (SATB).
   TOT/TOA events will be to either a simulated or actual event. First pilots/copilots will
   accomplish a NVG takeoff and landing using normal procedures (non-maximum effort).
   Note: This portion of the evaluation is not required if the additional aircraft does not have
   the speed and range to reach mountainous terrain.
   4.5.2. Periodic. The evaluation profile will include a minimum of 30 minutes of NVG low-
   level to a TOT/TOA; tactical recovery (non-SCA); SCA; a maximum effort takeoff and
   landing (see Paragraph 4.5.3); threat reaction; NVG takeoff and landing and a CARP)
   airdrop (actual or Simulated). TOT/TOA events will be to either a simulated or actual event.
   First pilots/copilots will accomplish a NVG takeoff and landing using normal procedures
   (non-maximum effort).
   4.5.3. Maximum Effort (ME) Takeoff and Landing. For aircraft with no clearly defined ME
   procedures this subarea is used to evaluate the examinees ability to land within a prescribed
   touchdown zone. If a landing zone is not available, a larger runway with a clearly
   identifiable 500 foot touch down zone may be used (instrument runway with requisite
   markings is sufficient). This event is normally accomplished as part of the mission
   evaluation. ME procedures are not required if it was previously evaluated during the
   qualification evaluation. For mission evaluations, first pilots/copilots accomplish the
   maximum effort takeoff and landing evaluation by demonstrating the duties required in the
   copilot position. As a minimum, thoroughly debrief first pilots/copilots on ME procedures.
   NVG takeoff/landing may be credited if flown to max effort standards. Note: One go-
   around is permitted, provided the aircraft does not touch down short of the zone.

     adjustment to the desired touchdown point, a simulated runway threshold will be
     identified and the grading criteria applied accordingly. For instrument approaches, the
     examinee should utilize a normal glide slope from either the decision height or from a
     point where visual acquisition of the runway environment is made. Specific items to
     evaluate include threshold altitude/airspeed, runway alignment, flare, touchdown speed,
     and landing crab.

5.1. General. Mission qualified navigators require a combined qualification and mission
evaluation. Navigators maintaining only basic qualification require a QUAL flight evaluation.
Instructors will demonstrate instructor duties on all periodic evaluations.
5.2. Requirements. Evaluate all general areas outlined in Table 2.1 on all evaluations. Also,
evaluate all instructors on areas in Table 3.1 on all evaluations. Navigator specific areas and
criteria are listed in this chapter.
5.3. QUAL. In addition to areas listed in Table 2.1 and Table 3.1, qualification evaluations
will include Note 1 areas in Table 5.1.
   5.3.1. Initial/Requalification. Navigators require an initial qualification evaluation in their
   primary USAF MDS prior to any nonstandard aircraft qualification evaluations. Requisites
   (prerequisites for initial/requalification evaluations) include Qualification Open and Closed
   Book examinations, EPE, and boldface (if applicable) examination. Required events include
   a minimum of a complete aircraft preflight, sortie, and a complete post flight. The evaluation
   profile will include a minimum of two hours of category I or category II routes using
   category I navigation procedures. State in the comments section of the AF Form 8 whether
   the evaluation was flown on a category I or category II route.

                              LOADMASTER EVALUATIONS

7.1. General. Mission qualified loadmasters require a combined qualification and mission
evaluation. Instructors will demonstrate instructor duties on all periodic evaluations. The
examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform all loadmaster duties safely and
effectively, including the operation of appropriate aircraft systems IAW with applicable technical
orders/flight manuals, instructions, and directives.
7.2. Requirements. Refer to Chapter 2 for general and Chapter 3 for instructor grading areas
and criteria. Loadmaster specific areas and criteria are listed in this chapter.
7.3. Qualification Evaluations. For qualification evaluations, Qualification Open and Closed
Book examinations (or Formal School End of Course examinations) are prerequisites for initial
evaluations and requisites for individuals who are not mission qualified. Depending on the
aircraft, boldface and EPE may be required for the evaluation. The EPE should cover areas
applicable to the duties of a loadmaster on the aircraft being evaluated on.
   7.3.1. Initial/Requalification. In addition to areas listed in Table 2.1 and Table 3.1,
   qualification evaluations will include Note 1 areas in Table 7.1. Loadmasters require an
   initial qualification evaluation in any each MDS aircraft that the loadmaster maintains
   qualification on. Required events include a minimum of complete aircraft preflight, a sortie
   of any type, and a complete postflight.
   7.3.2. Periodic. Periodic qualification evaluations will be accomplished on each MDS
   aircraft that the loadmaster maintains qualification on. Complete evaluation as outlined in
   Paragraph 7.3.1.
7.4. Mission Qualification. Mission evaluations may be administered concurrently with the
initial qualification evaluation. Requalification evaluations will be administered as required to
regain qualification. Mission Open and Closed Book examinations (or Formal School End of
Course examinations) and an EPE are requisites (prerequisites for initial).
   7.4.1. Initial/Requalification. Administer the evaluation to include, as a minimum: a
   complete aircraft preflight; completion of the applicable weight and balance forms; one
   airdrop if the aircraft is capable; and an aircraft postflight. Airdrop may be any
   equipment/personnel delivery. Door bundles may be used when it is the only type of
   equipment the aircraft is capable of dropping. SATBs airdrop is not acceptable for
   evaluation.
   7.4.2. Periodic. Administer the evaluation on any flight representative of the mission of the
   aircraft being evaluated on. This includes airdrop (excluding SATBs), and Forward Area
   Refueling Point (FARP). Specify in the comment section of the AF Form 8, the type of
   mission accomplished. If the evaluation is accomplished on FARP the following restrictions
   apply:
   7.4.3. Accomplish FARP evaluations on tanker aircraft under NVG conditions.
