        authorized individuals trained in defensive and evasive driving techniques. Authorized
        individuals include, but are not limited to: military member or person occupying high-
        risk billets (does not include any dependents), Security Forces, AFOSI special agents,
        Transportation Squadron personnel and foreign nationals assigned as drivers for
        individuals in high-risk billets. Other individuals may be authorized (in writing) on a
        case-by-case basis depending on specific circumstances surrounding the use of the HAV
        in their respective area of responsibility. All drivers must have successfully completed
        specialized antiterrorism defensive and evasive driver training.

3.2. AV Logistics and Alternate Considerations:
     3.2.1. Procurement of HAVs will be handled according to DoD Directive C-4500.51, DoD
     Commercially Procured and Leased Armored Vehicle Policy and AFI 23-302, Vehicle
     Management.
     3.2.2. When warranted by the local threat, achieve transportation security objectives through
     selective use of LAVs, unarmored indigenous vehicles, vehicle painting and marking
     exemptions, and domicile-to-duty transportation. Refer to AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations.
     3.2.3. HAV drivers will not exceed the armoring firm's recommended top speed, as armoring
     adds significantly to a vehicle's weight and required stopping distance.
     3.2.4. Due to the sensitivity of nontactical AV transparent armor to interior heat build-up,
     direct sunlight, and ultraviolet light, garage AVs whenever practical. As a minimum, place
     them under cover, such as a carport, to prevent long-term damage. Prolonged exposure
     causes delamination and loss of the rated ballistic defeat capabilities of the transparent armor.
     3.2.5. Upon determining an AV is unserviceable, Air Force elements will:
        3.2.5.1. Send a message to Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC ROBINS
        AFB GA// LVDV//) with information copies to SAF/IGX and AFOSI/Logistics and
        Engineering (AFOSI/LG) requesting vehicle disposition instructions.

     3.2.5.2. Salvage subject vehicle according to AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual.
     3.2.5.3. Remove all transparent armor and opaque armoring materials from LAVs prior
     to turning them in for disposal.

Terms
Detail Leaderâ€”A special agent, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), assigned
overall responsibility for the personal safety and security of a principal during a protective
service operation (PSO). The detail leader is authorized to make decisions on all matters
concerning the immediate personal safety and security of the principal.
Distinguished Visitor (DV)â€”A guest of the US Air Force or DoD who, by virtue of rank or
position, receives honors or protocol.
Fully Armored Vehiclesâ€”These vehicles are referred to as nontactical heavy armored vehicles
(HAV). HAVs are commercially designed and manufactured, fully armored configured, motor
vehicles procured especially to provide security protection to certain key DoD officials or
visiting dignitaries.
Highâ€”Risk DoD Personnelâ€”US personnel and their family members whose grade,
assignment, travel itinerary, or symbolic value may make them an especially attractive or
accessible terrorist target.
Partially Armored Vehiclesâ€”These motor vehicles are referred to as nontactical light armored
vehicles (LAV). MAJCOMs obtain standard vehicles through normal procurement channels to
AFI71-101V2 17 MAY 2011                                                                            11


fulfill valid transportation requirements and later alter them by affixing armoring materials to the
windows and body areas.
Primary Agencyâ€”A law enforcement, security, or investigative agency with overall
responsibility (as established by law or directive) for providing protective services for a
principal.
Principalâ€”Another name for the High Risk Personnel of a protective service operation. A
principal may or may not be a distinguished visitor (DV).
Protective Serviceâ€”A specialized activity, which increases the personal safety and security of a
distinguished visitor or other principal. The activity may be limited to a protective threat
assessment or may extend to a major PSO involving considerable manpower and resources.
Protective Service Operation (PSO)â€”The use of specialized techniques and procedures by
trained personnel to ensure a principalâ€™s personal safety and security during a specific event,
while traveling, or over an extended period of time. When required, a PSO can be tailored to
provide 24-hour protection. In such cases, the security detail establishes defensive overt or
clandestine perimeters around the principal for the term of the PSO at the residence, during
travel, and at all sites on the principalâ€™s daily itinerary.
PSOâ€”Long Termâ€”Any PSO which lasts longer than 30 days and does not have a known
termination date. Usually, AFOSI conducts such operations to protect against a specific threat or
vulnerability when the principal cannot be relocated.
Protective Threat Assessment (PTA)â€”Collecting and analyzing information to identify direct
and potential threats to harm, seize, interfere with, or embarrass a specific principal, as well as to
determine the existing and anticipated security environment. A PTA is always the initial phase of
a PSO.
