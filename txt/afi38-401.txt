This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 38-4, The Innovative Development
Through Employee Awareness (IDEA) Program and Department of Defense (DoD) 1400.25-M, DoD
Civilian Personnel Manual, Subchapter 451, Awards. It gives the directive requirements for the Air Force
IDEA Program. It does not apply to Air National Guard (ANG) Title 32 military members or National
Guard technicians employed under Title 32, United States Code (U.S.C.) 709. Awards are based on the
merits of the contribution and benefits, without regard to grade or rank, race, color, religion, sex, marital
status, national origin, physical handicap, age, political affiliation, or union membership affiliation or par-
ticipation. Proposed supplements must be recommended for approval by the Air Force Manpower Agency
(AFMA), and approved by Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Directorate of Manpower, Organization, and
Resources (HQ USAF/A1M). Under Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-360, Publications Management Pro-
gram, supplements will not change the intent of the governing directive. Refer recommended changes,
using Air Force Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to AFMA/MAP, 550 E Street

                   ELIGIBILITY, SUBMISSIONS, AND RECONSIDERATIONS

2.1. Submission Eligibility. All Department of Defense (DoD) military, civilian employees, and con-
tract personnel are eligible to participate in the Air Force IDEA Program. Eligibility for monetary award
is determined by employment status at the time of submission.

2.2. Idea Eligibility Criteria. To be eligible, an idea:
   2.2.1. Must be the submitter’s own thought or a new application of an old principle.
   2.2.2. Must benefit the Air Force.
   2.2.3. Must provide present method, proposed method, and expected benefits.
   2.2.4. May be within submitter’s job responsibility.

2.3. Idea Ineligibility Criteria. Specifically, an idea is:
   2.3.1. Ineligible if it appears in the IDEA Pool which is a centralized pool listing all closed ideas with
   valid submitter’s ownership rights. These ideas may be adopted, as appropriate, by any installation;
   however, no award will be paid for implementing these ideas.
   2.3.2. Ineligible if it is vague, incomplete, or deals with generalities or opinions.
   2.3.3. Ineligible if it appears to be a personal complaint or criticism.

     2.3.16. Ineligible if the approved separate improvement process (SIP) is determined to be a correc-
     tion.

2.4. Submitting Ideas:
     2.4.1. An individual or group may submit ideas.
     2.4.2. Submitters should have supervisor’s telephone number and e-mail address available prior to
     initiating the submission.
     2.4.3. Ideas must be titled and written to allow effective search of the IDEA Pool.
     2.4.4. Ideas must state the following:
        2.4.4.1. Present method (a detailed description and costs of present method).
        2.4.4.2. Proposed method (a detailed description and costs of proposed method).
        2.4.4.3. Expected benefits (a detailed description of expected benefits to the government).
     2.4.5. The Air Force and/or other federal agency has the right to disapprove an idea.

2.5. Group Ideas. The primary submitter will enter the submission into IPDS and identify all co-submit-
ters. Co-submitters will have 5 working days from initial submission to attach themselves to the idea via
IPDS. If all co-submitters do not meet this requirement, the idea will be deemed ineligible. The idea can
be resubmitted. Additional co-submitters cannot be added at a later date. For approved group ideas, all
members of the group will be recognized appropriately.

2.6. After-the-Fact Ideas:
     2.6.1. An after-the-fact idea is an idea that has been presented formally or informally to management
     prior to submission into the Air Force IDEA Program. Management is an individual who has the
     authority to give submitter approval to pursue the idea.
     2.6.2. The idea must be submitted into the Air Force IDEA Program within 90 working days of pre-
     sentation of the idea. The submitter must describe:
        2.6.2.1. Date of presentation and to whom (must provide name, duty title, telephone number, and
        e-mail address).
        2.6.2.2. Present method (a detailed description and cost of new method).
        2.6.2.3. Proposed method (a detailed description of how the new method was implemented).
        2.6.2.4. Expected benefits (a detailed description of expected benefits to the government).

2.7. Separate Improvement Process (SIP) Ideas:
     2.7.1. A SIP is a methodology used to initiate a process change governed by other directives (e.g., AF
     Form 1046, AF Form 2288, AF IMT 3215, or AF Form 1067). See Attachment 4 and Attachment 5
     for a list of Confirmatory SIP ideas and the most commonly used After-the-Fact SIP ideas. Approved
     SIPs may be submitted as Confirmatory SIP or After-the-Fact SIP ideas for recognition through the
     IDEA Program. Ideas that require a SIP to approve are ineligible and will be returned to the submitter.
AFI38-401 21 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                                11


   2.7.2. All external issues (e.g., tangible savings, intangible benefits, form marked as correction not
   improvement) between the submitter and SIP approval authority must be resolved before submission
   into the IDEA Program.
   2.7.3. Submission into the IDEA Program must be within 90 working days of the date the submitter
   received notification of the approved SIP. The approved SIP can be attached to the idea at the time of
   submission or a hard copy must be provided to the Base IDEA Program Office within five working
   days. If the approved SIP is not received by the Base IDEA Program Office within five working days
   of submission, the idea will be ineligible. Once the submitter has obtained a copy of the approved SIP
   and all issues have been resolved, the idea can be resubmitted.
   2.7.4. Ownership rights, job responsibility determination (JRD), and monetary award eligibility for
   approved SIPs are determined by the date of submission into the IDEA Program.
   2.7.5. Confirmatory SIP Ideas. Confirmatory SIP ideas result from an approved form where owner-
   ship is established, tangible savings and/or intangible benefits are documented, and the form is
   marked “improvement”. The functional OPR will be required to provide the documentation used to
   support any reported savings. If the validating documentation is not provided to the Base IDEA Pro-
   gram Office, within ten working days of approval, the tangible savings will be deemed as intangible
   benefits. There will be only one award regardless of how many regulations, manuals, technical orders,
   etc., the SIP may effect.
   2.7.6. After-the-Fact SIP Ideas. After-the-Fact SIP ideas result from an approved form which does
   not identify ownership, does not document tangible savings and/or intangible benefits, and the form
   does not indicate if it is an improvement or correction. The Base IDEA Program Office must contact
   the functional OPR to determine if the SIP is an improvement or correction prior to determining eligi-
   bility. The idea will be forwarded to the approving authority listed on the SIP for determination of tan-
   gible savings and/or intangible benefits.

2.8. Job Responsibility Determination (JRD):
   2.8.1. JRD Policy:
      2.8.1.1. If a submitter, without approval of higher authority (including the reporting official or
      supervisor) can implement an idea, the action is considered to be within job responsibility.
      2.8.1.2. If the submitter’s primary responsibility is to make recommendations on the subject mat-
      ter contained in the idea, the action is considered to be within job responsibility. If in doubt, check
      the submitter’s position description or enlisted/officer performance report for verification.
      2.8.1.3. If an idea is developed by a team or group and can be implemented without approval of
      higher authority, or if the team has been officially chartered, in writing, to make recommendations
      on the subject matter contained in the idea, the action is considered to be within job responsibility.
      2.8.1.4. As a general rule, if not addressed above, ideas from base level that must be approved and
      implemented at command or higher level normally are outside job responsibility. The same ratio-
      nale applies for command personnel when approval authority is at Headquarters Air Force or
      higher.
      2.8.1.5. All other ideas are considered to be outside job responsibility.
   2.8.2. JRD Process:
12                                                                      AFI38-401 21 NOVEMBER 2007


        2.8.2.1. The JRD will be determined based on the submitter’s and functional OPR’s PAS Code for
        approved ideas.
            2.8.2.1.1. If PAS Code is the same, the JRD will be determined as within JRD.
            2.8.2.1.2. If PAS Code is different, the JRD will be determined as outside JRD.
        2.8.2.2. During the validation process, the Base IA will contact the submitter’s supervisor to ver-
        ify JRD.
        2.8.2.3. If submitter disagrees with the determination, a request for reconsideration may be sub-
        mitted in accordance with paragraph 2.10.

2.9. Retaining Ownership Rights:
     2.9.1. Ownership is determined by the first idea to reach the final approval/disapproval authority.
     2.9.2. The submitter retains ownership rights of an idea for 12 months after final action. Final action
     for disapproved ideas is the disapproval date. Final action for approved ideas is: a) implementation
     date; or b) pending implementation date; or c) date forwarded for payment, whichever is the latter.

2.10. Request for Reconsideration:
     2.10.1. Request for reconsideration will be submitted only after notification of final action of the idea.
     2.10.2. Requests are limited to one per idea. If a submitter requests reconsideration of any part of the
     evaluation (job responsibility, evaluation, or award), it must be combined into one request. A second
     request for reconsideration will not be accepted.
     2.10.3. The request must contain one or more of the following reasons: additional evidence, new
     material or information, a new approach, or clarification of significant issues.
     2.10.4. Disagreement with the final evaluation is not justification for reconsideration.
     2.10.5. Request for reconsideration of Confirmatory SIP ideas will only be accepted for JRD. Request
     for reconsideration of Confirmatory SIP evaluation or award amounts will not be accepted. Submitter
     must resolve ALL issues (e.g., tangible savings or intangible benefits) with the functional OPR of the
     SIP prior to submitting the idea.

2.11. Withdrawing Ideas:
     2.11.1. Submitter must submit a request for withdrawal via IPDS. To be eligible for withdrawal, the
     request must be submitted prior to final approval or disapproval.
     2.11.2. After determining the request is eligible, the Base IA will process the request for withdrawal
     via IPDS. The request for withdrawal will be maintained by the Base IA for one year after final action.
     2.11.3. Upon request to withdraw the idea, the submitter relinquishes ownership of the idea.

                                               Chapter 3

                                        EVALUATING IDEAS

3.1. Evaluation Process:
   3.1.1. An idea that needs MAJCOM, Air Force, or other federal agency approval requires a base-level
   evaluation if the idea affects local procedures. The evaluation analysis will state how it affects local
   procedures and identify the next-level functional OPR.
   3.1.2. If there is no base-level functional OPR, the idea will be referred to the MAJCOM functional
   OPR for evaluation.
   3.1.3. Incomplete evaluations or improperly routed ideas will be returned to the evaluator’s Unit POC
   for correction.

3.2. Evaluating Ideas. Good ideas directly affect efficiency and effectiveness of the Air Force and other
federal agencies. Evaluators must make every effort to ensure ideas receive the same timely and positive
responses given any other communication. Decisions must be fully justified or the evaluation will be con-
sidered incomplete.
   3.2.1. Only one evaluation per level is allowed (e.g., base, MAJCOM, or Air Force). An evaluation
   that requires coordination with one or more functional OPR at the same level must be accomplished
   prior to completing the evaluation. Coordination must be documented in the evaluation analysis to
   include name, duty title, telephone, and e-mail address.
   3.2.2. Evaluators may request additional information from the submitter prior to completing the eval-
   uation. The submitter has 10 working days to provide the additional information. If the submitter does
   not provide the additional information within the required timeframe, the idea will be disapproved as
   vague and incomplete. Once the submitter has obtained the additional information, the idea can be
   resubmitted.
   3.2.3. If an idea cannot be adopted as written, consider whether it may be adopted in part or modified.
   If during the evaluation process the idea leads an evaluator to conclude there is a better alternative or
   solution, that solution should be adopted and the submitter given credit.
   3.2.4. When an evaluator recommends higher-level review, the next-level functional OPR must be
   identified in the evaluation analysis to include: name, duty title, telephone number, and e-mail
   address.
   3.2.5. Telephone coordination with the final disapproval authority is authorized when the evaluator
   does not have disapproval authority. Coordination must be documented in the evaluation analysis to
   include name, duty title, telephone, and e-mail address.
   3.2.6. Evaluators must maintain documentation used to determine tangible savings for 12 months fol-
   lowing final approval or implementation, whichever is later. This documentation will be required if an
   audit of the evaluation is conducted.
   3.2.7. Evaluators must provide a copy of the documentation used to determine tangible savings to the
   Base IDEA Program Office within 10 working days of approval. If the supporting documentation is
   not provided, the savings will not be validated and proper recognition may not be given to the submit-
   ter.
14                                                                    AFI38-401 21 NOVEMBER 2007


     3.2.8. Evaluators are responsible for ensuring implementation for approved ideas. If implementation
     cannot take place within one year of approval, the idea will be disapproved; however, if an implemen-
     tation plan can be developed to justify extended delay, the idea will be approved.
     3.2.9. Evaluation Disposition:
        3.2.9.1. Approved – Evaluator has the authority to approve and implement the idea.
            3.2.9.1.1. Approved Mandatory – Evaluator is approving the idea with mandatory implemen-
            tation. The evaluation analysis must provide rationale for adoption, state how you plan to
            implement the idea, and provide tangible savings and/or intangible benefits for your level
            only.
            3.2.9.1.2. Approved Mandatory and Recommend Wider Use – Evaluator is approving the idea
            with mandatory implementation and is recommending the idea be forwarded to the next level
            functional OPR for consideration. The evaluation analysis must provide rationale for adoption,
            state how you plan to implement the idea, provide tangible savings and/or intangible benefits
            for your level only, and identify the next-level functional OPR.
            3.2.9.1.3. Approved Optionally – Evaluator is approving the idea with optional implementa-
            tion. Idea is approved as an alternate way of doing business. The evaluation analysis must pro-
            vide rationale for adoption, state how you plan to implement the idea, and provide tangible
            savings and/or intangible benefits for your level only.
            3.2.9.1.4. Approved Optionally and Recommend Wider Use - Evaluator is approving the idea
            with optional implementation and is recommending the idea be forwarded to the next level
            functional OPR for consideration. Idea is approved as an alternate way of doing business. The
            evaluation analysis must provide rationale for adoption, state how you plan to implement the
            idea, provide tangible savings and/or intangible benefits for your level only, and identify the
            next-level functional OPR.
        3.2.9.2. Recommend Approval – Evaluator does not have authority to approve but recommends
        next level approval. The evaluation analysis must provide rationale for recommending adoption,
        provide tangible savings and/or intangible benefits for your level only, and identify the next-level
        functional OPR.
        3.2.9.3. Disapproved – Evaluator has the authority to disapprove the idea. The evaluation analysis
        must provide rationale for disapproval. If the functional OPR (at any level) is recommending dis-
        approval, he/she can contact the approval authority and obtain telephonic disapproval. The func-
        tional OPR must include the following statement in the evaluation analysis “This evaluation was
        coordinated with (and include) individual’s name, office symbol, DSN, and e-mail address.”
        3.2.9.4. Recommend Disapproval – Evaluator does not have the authority to disapprove but rec-
        ommends next level disapproval. The evaluation analysis must provide rationale for recommend-
        ing disapproval and identify the next-level functional OPR.
        3.2.9.5. Already Under Consideration – Evaluator has the authority to disapprove the idea
        because it is currently being considered. The evaluation analysis must provide how it is currently
        being considered and by whom.
        3.2.9.6. Already In Use – Evaluator has the authority to disapprove the idea because it has already
        been implemented. The evaluation analysis must provide how it is being done and by whom.
AFI38-401 21 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                              15


3.3. Base-Level Evaluator:
   3.3.1. Must complete evaluation within five working days of receipt of notification.
   3.3.2. Must follow requirements as outlined in paragraph 3.1.

3.4. MAJCOM-Level Evaluator:
   3.4.1. Must complete evaluation within 10 working days of receipt of notification.
   3.4.2. Must follow requirements outlined in paragraph 3.1.
   3.4.3. When a MAJCOM-level evaluator approves an idea, identifies intangible benefits, and recom-
   mends wider use, the idea will automatically be approved optionally at Air Force level.
   3.4.4. When a MAJCOM-level evaluator recommends disapproval, the idea will automatically be dis-
   approved at Air Force level.

3.5. Air Force-Level Evaluator:
   3.5.1. Must complete evaluation within 10 working days of receipt of notification.
   3.5.2. Must follow requirements outlined in paragraph 3.1.
   3.5.3. Only approved or recommended for approval Air Force ideas will be forwarded to other federal
   agencies for consideration. The Air Force level evaluator must identify other federal agency func-
   tional OPR and forward the idea to AFMA for further processing. The evaluation analysis must con-
   tain the federal agency’s name, functional OPR’s name, duty title, telephone number, and e-mail
   address. If this information is not provided, AFMA will return the idea to the Air Force functional
   OPR.
   3.5.4. If the disapproval authority is outside the Air Force (e.g., DoD or other federal agency) and the
   Air Force-level evaluator does not recommend approval, the idea will be disapproved. Based on DoD
   policy, all ideas must be recommended for approval to be eligible for consideration.

3.6. Evaluation Delay Request:
   3.6.1. A delay of the evaluation must be requested through the Base IA with proper justification.
   3.6.2. The Base IA approves or disapproves the evaluation delay request within three working days
   from receipt of notification.
   3.6.3. The Base IA can approve delay of evaluation up to 15 working days per evaluation level.

3.7. Tangible Savings:
   3.7.1. Tangible savings must meet at least one of the following conditions:
      3.7.1.1. Measurable, quantifiable savings that can be supported by applicable documentation.
      3.7.1.2. Reduced or removed operating cost (such as utilities, travel, and repair).
      3.7.1.3. Costs for manpower funded authorizations. When manpower resource savings are identi-
      fied, the functional OPR must provide the Base IDEA Program Office proper documentation indi-
      cating the positions were removed from the Unit Manning Document.
16                                                                     AFI38-401 21 NOVEMBER 2007


     3.7.2. Tangible savings are realized when documentation to support reported savings can be provided
     for validation purposes. If life-cycle savings are realized, number of years must be provided.

3.8. Intangible Benefits. Benefits that cannot be computed in specific monetary terms. When tangible
savings cannot be quantified, the significance of the approved idea must be stated in the text.

3.9. Computation of Savings:
     3.9.1. The Base IDEA Program Office and/or IDEA Validation Committee validates accuracy of tan-
     gible savings reported by evaluators.
     3.9.2. Tangible savings are computed based on validated savings for the first year of operation.
     EXCEPTION: When the improvement has a significant up-front investment (a minimum of 50 percent
     of the validated first-year savings) but will yield tangible savings for more than one year (normally
     three years or life-cycle savings), the evaluator will manually calculate the average annual net savings.
     3.9.3. Do not include any costs associated with conducting the evaluation or printing costs for publi-
     cations.

                                  IDEA PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

Section 4A—Base Level Program Responsibilities

4.1. Eligibility Determination:
   4.1.1. The Base IA determines eligibility within three working days from receipt of notification.
   4.1.2. If the idea requires additional information or clarification prior to eligibility determination, the
   Base IA will notify the submitter of the required information or clarification.
       4.1.2.1. The submitter will update the idea within five working days from receipt of notification.
       4.1.2.2. If the submitter does not update the idea within the required timeframe, the idea will be
       deemed ineligible. Once the submitter has rewritten the idea, it can be resubmitted.
   4.1.3. The Base IA checks the IDEA Pool for ideas that duplicate another proposed method for which
   someone holds ownership rights. If a new idea identifies the same current method as an earlier idea
   but contributes a different proposed method, it is not considered a duplicate and will be evaluated on
   its own merits.

4.2. Validation Process:
   4.2.1. Validation of JRD:
       4.2.1.1. The Base IA will validate JRD within one working day from receipt of notification.
       4.2.1.2. If in doubt of accuracy of JRD, the Base IA will task the supervisor to verify JRD.
       4.2.1.3. The supervisor will verify JRD, based on the merits of each idea, within three working
       days from receipt of notification. For further guidance, see paragraph 2.8.
   4.2.2. Validation of Tangible Savings:
       4.2.2.1. Base IA will validate tangible savings within 10 working days from receipt of notifica-
       tion.
       4.2.2.2. Base IA is allowed one validation delay not to exceed 10 working days.
       4.2.2.3. All supporting documentation must be obtained from the evaluator and/or the submitter if
       tangible savings are reported.
       4.2.2.4. Calculations must contain: (1) cost of present method, (2) cost of proposed method, and
       (3) total savings (difference between the two methods minus implementation costs).
       4.2.2.5. Base IA will validate accuracy of documentation to support savings that does not exceed
       their payment approval authority in accordance with paragraph 4.4.; anything above must be vali-
       dated by the IDEA Validation Committee.

4.5. Monetary Awards. Monetary awards are paid upon validation of tangible savings and/or intangible
benefits, not implementation of the idea. Tangible savings are computed based on validated savings for
the first year of operation. EXCEPTION: When the improvement has a significant up-front investment (a
minimum of 50 percent of the validated first-year savings), but will yield tangible savings for more than
one year (normally three years), the evaluator will manually calculate the average annual net savings.
   4.5.1. Ideas extracted from the IDEA Pool may be adopted, as appropriate, by any installation. No
   award will be paid for implementing these ideas.
   4.5.2. Ideas are paid upon validation of reported tangible savings and/or intangible benefits.

   tangible savings and/or intangible benefits. Do not delay payment until idea is implemented.

   4.5.5. All monetary awards are subject to applicable tax rules.
   4.5.6. The maximum award for one idea is $10,000.
   4.5.7. When a group idea is found to be within job responsibility of one or more submitters, but not
   within the job responsibility of the remaining submitters, awards are automatically calculated in IPDS
   and paid according to the criteria appropriate to each submitter’s status.
   4.5.8. An award can be paid at each level of approval where tangible savings are realized. The com-
   bined award cannot exceed the maximum award amount of $10,000. Awards will be calculated and
   previous payments will be subtracted from the total award.
   4.5.9. Generally, an award that is erroneously paid because of management or administrative error
   cannot be recovered.
   4.5.10. When an award is paid for an idea made under false pretenses, the case file will be referred to
