    3.2. Material Deficiency Report (MDR) Items (see paragraph 6.4.).
    3.3. 31 LRS and Maintenance DIFM briefing:
       3.3.1. The purpose of this briefing is to provide required training to reparable asset managers and
       LRS monitors, report discrepancies and turn-in delinquencies and distribute information relative
       to the DIFM and mission capable programs.
       3.3.2. The 31 Maintenance Group Comander (31 MXG) will be briefed weekly on the current
       DIFM status. The 31 LRS Flight Service Center (FSC) will put all DIFM’s that are over five cal-
       endar days on a PowerPoint slide using status as of 1200 hours every Thursday. The slide will
       include the document number, nomenclature, issue days and locations. This slide will be e-mailed
       to the Maintenance Supply Liaison (MSL) NLT 1400 each Thursday. The MSL office will forward
       this slide to all applicable parties, to include 31 Maintenance Operations Squadron/31 Mainte-
       nance Operation Control Center (31 MOS/31 MOCC), NLT 1500 each Thursday. This slide will
       be viewed each Friday at the 31 MXG Aircraft Status meeting at 0830, and each Maintenance
       shop will brief their applicable DIFM’s that are over five calendar days.

4. Responsibilities. All activities listed below will attend and provide inputs to the quarterly Intermedi-
ate Repair Enhancement Program (IREP) meeting. The IREP is tentatively scheduled for the third Tues-
day following the last month in the given quarter. The IREP meeting will be held in the 31 FW conference
room or the 31 MXG conference room, depending on availability. This meeting is mandatory for all func-
tions listed in Paragraph 4.1. of this publication.
    4.1. The IREP meeting provides senior wing leadership a forum to evaluate current aircraft weapons
    systems resource status, highlight specific problem areas, focus on local repair initiatives and discuss
    ways to improve the repair cycle process. The 31 MXG/CC is the office of primary responsibility for
AVIANOI23-102 8 FEBRUARY 2005                                                                           3


  the IREP. This forum will consist of personnel who can resolve problems within the base repair pro-
  cess. Personnel from 31 LRS, 31 MOS, 31 MXS squadrons and off-base equipment repair activities,
  as well as financial managers are critical to program success. The meeting will be chaired by the 31
  MXG/CC (if requested, 31FW/CC). Participants will include the following commanders or desig-
  nated representative: 31 MXG/CC, 31 MSG/CC, 31 LRS/CC, 31 AMXS/CC, 31 MOS/CC, represen-
  tatives from MOC, Maintenance Analysis, Quality Assurance (QA), Avionics, Propulsion, Air Force
  Repair Enhancement Program (AFREP), FSC, MSL and the 555th and 510th AMUs.
  4.2. During each IREP meeting the appropriate asset manager will lead the discussion on key data for
  each specific asset. IREP meetings will be conducted on a quarterly basis to ensure the repair cycle
  process is on track, to seek improvement methods and to apply necessary resources to get the job
  done. The first order of business will be a review of action items from the previous meeting.
  4.3. 31 MXG/CC Responsibilities: The 31 MXG/CC will task all appropriate base activities to submit
  inputs for the IREP through the MSL. The MSL will coordinate and receive slides from the following
  activities: FSC, 555th and 510th AMUs, 31 MOS Maintenance Analysis, Avionics, Propulsion and
  AFREP.
  4.4. 31 LRS/CC Responsibilities: The 31 LRS/CC is ultimately responsible for the accountability of
  assets in the repair cycle by providing training on reparable assets management, providing visibility of
  repair cycle trends through management products, weekly 31 LRS Maintenance DIFM briefings and
  inputs to the IREP. The 31 LRS/CC delegates these responsibilities to the FSC.
  4.5. FSC Responsibilities: FSC handles the daily management of assets in the repair cycle. The FSC
  implements its responsibilities by accomplishing the following actions:
     4.5.1. Provide the Repair Cycle Asset Management (D23) Listing in location and stock number
     sequence to all applicable maintenance activities.
     4.5.2. Process all supply transactions to update repair cycle records. (Note: DIFM status must be
     updated immediately by the gaining units to ensure accountability of assets in the repair cycle.
     Units without access to the Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS) or Standard Base Sup-
     ply System (SBSS) can call in DIFM item status updates to the FSC at extension 632-7750/8888).
     4.5.3. Relocate DIFM assets to subsequent work centers or holding areas.
     4.5.4. Pick up DIFM assets required for turn-in into the SBSS.
     4.5.5. Pick up and transport 2LM assets.
     4.5.6. Provide Block IIB Reparable Asset Management training.
     4.5.7. Provide the MSL inputs for IREP briefings.
     4.5.8. Brief the 31 LRS/CC or LGR during the monthly How Goes It.
  4.6. Unit Commander Responsibilities:
     4.6.1. All units supported by the 31 FW, including GSUs and deployed units are responsible for
     managing reparable assets within their possession in accordance with the provisions of this
     instruction and applicable directives cited above.
     4.6.2. Unit commanders are ultimately responsible for the efficient management of public prop-
     erty under their control. Commanders are also responsible for prioritizing asset repair based on
     actual mission needs, to move assets through the repair cycle as quickly as possible, to accomplish
4                                                                AVIANOI23-102 8 FEBRUARY 2005


       quality repair actions, to maximize repair capability and to quickly evacuate those assets which
       can not be repaired locally within the time criteria specified above. Commanders will ensure all
       activities adhere to the references cited by this instruction and the instructions within the para-
       graphs below.

5. General. The applicable maintenance repair section chief establishes a production schedule based on
priorities established in AFI 21-101, Table 1.
    5.1. FSC provides the D23, to assist each repair section in controlling reparable processing and DIFM
    assets. This listing also aids in scheduling adjustments and setting repair priority. Repair sections,
    Maintenance Support Units (MSUs), Materiel Control Units and back shops use the D23 to manage
    the flow of DIFM assets in the repair cycle process and to ensure the DIFM status is updated immedi-
    ately upon movement of assets.
    5.2. Maintenance work centers may use AFTO IMT 350, Reparable Item Processing Tag, or CAMS
    screen #380 to control work. If using AFTO IMT 350, establish a file in priority sequence with three
    sections: in work, awaiting maintenance, and awaiting parts. If using CAMS to control work, all work
    orders will be prioritized on CAMS screen #380 by scheduling dates and times. Regardless of which
    option is used, it is important that DIFM status be current and accurate. Use AF IMT 2520, Repair
    Cycle Control Log, or DD Form 1348-1A, DoD Single Line Item Release/Receipt documents to
    record all turn-ins.
    5.3. Ensure demand data updates are processed in CAMS and the SBSS, for all turnaround (TRN)
    transactions. Failure to update TRN transactions can have a negative impact on stockage effectiveness
    at base level. Failure to process TRNs affects stock levels and results in incomplete reports. Air Force
    Materiel Command (AFMC) utilizes these reports to make buy, repair, and distribution decisions.
    5.4. Maintenance will call the FSC during normal duty hours for pick-up of all 2LM and Agile Logis-
    tics items. After normal duty hours, customers will call the After-Hours Support Element, extension
    632-7062, to arrange expedite pick-up. Other DIFM assets will be picked up during the normal repa-
    rable asset pick-up schedule. The 31 LRS FSC will be called immediately when assets are ready for
    movement to the next work center or holding area as applicable. Gaining units with CAMS capability
    and FSC for those units without CAMS capability will immediately update the DIFM status code.
    5.5. Process all components requiring coordination through multiple sections using the same process
    as other items. The equipment or repair sections owning work center will identify multiple section
    actions in block 15 of the AFTO IMT 350 and in CAMS. As each section completes work, annotate
    block 25 and update CAMS to reflect the work was completed. Note: If a requested part is backor-
    dered and the unserviceable DIFM item does not limit or restrict the operational capability of the end
    item, remove it and send it to the applicable support section for repair, NRTS, or condemnation action
    and subsequent turn-in to 31 LRS (as a credit DIFM) according to TO 00-20-3.
    5.6. Classified assets are processed in the same manner as other components, except technicians indi-
    cate on the face of the AFTO IMT 350 that the item is classified. Use a stamp that reads, “CLASSI-
    FIED” or “This item is classified and must be handled according to AFI 31-401, Managing the
    Information Security Program.” The section responsible for the bench check or repair makes sure that
    security classification of the component is clearly marked but documentation is not visible on the out-
    side container. In addition, each activity maintains a current list of personnel authorized to receive
    classified components. Each organization is responsible to ensure the current list of personnel autho-
AVIANOI23-102 8 FEBRUARY 2005                                                                          5


   rized to receive classified components is updated at the Document Control element, (31 LRS/LGRSP)
   Extension 632-7228. Failure to update the classified list will result in delivery delays. Additional
   guidance is found in TO 00-20-3 and AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 18. Para. 18.21.

6. Specific Guidance:
   6.1. Awaiting Parts (AWP) Assets and Cross-Cannibalization control. Maintenance activities request
   repair bits and pieces or determine if cross-cannibalization action is feasible.
      6.1.1. The USAFE Regional Supply Squadron (URSS) is responsible for requisitioning, lateral
      support, follow-up, and monitoring status of repair bits and pieces. Repair section asset managers
      are responsible for documenting and conveying impacts to the URSS AWP manager if status is
      unacceptable.
      6.1.2. AWP status will be reported to applicable maintenance activities during the IREP meeting.
      6.1.3. URSS is responsible for requesting disposition of and the actual evacuation of assets when
      repair parts are unavailable. Non-availability of parts alone is not authority to evacuate an item,
      disposition authority must still be received.
   6.2. Removal of Bit and Piece Repair from Condemned Assets. The end item manager is condemna-
   tion authority for XD assets. Do not remove bit and piece repair parts from XD assets being NRTS to
   the depot without item manager’s approval. Item manager approval will be coordinated with FSC.
   Selected bit and piece repair parts may be removed from condemned XB/XF end items at the base or
   field level.
      6.2.1. Once an asset is condemned, remove XB items from end items that do not exceed the 75
      percent economic repair criteria. Tag removed items with the appropriate condition tag and retain
      to enhance local repair capability.
      6.2.2. Maintenance activities will remove and store serviceable XB bits and pieces as operating
      stock or if no future requirements are anticipated, turn-in to 31 LRS through Aviano Instruction
      23-106, Reclamation of Consumable (XB3) Assets.
   6.3. Local Manufacture. Items subject to this method of supply are identified in the applicable end
   item TO. Specific procedures are found in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11; AFMAN
   23-110, Volume 2, Part 13; Supply Operating Instruction 23-100; and Local Manufacture.
      6.3.1. The manufacture of procurable items (those not source coded JBD) is restricted to those
      items which are mission essential. Local manufacture of items coded JBD are also limited to mis-
      sion needs. The FSC approves all local manufacture requests. Requests are consolidated through
      the requesting squadron’s maintenance officer/maintenance superintendent and QA prior to sub-
      mission to the FSC for approval by signing the AF IMT 2005, Issue/Turn-In Request.
      6.3.2. The requester submits an AF IMT 2005 for previously loaded items JBD stock numbers or
      a DD Form 1348-6, DoD Single Line Requisition System Document, for newly assigned stock
      numbers to the FSC. The requester also provides necessary documentation and data to include a
      drawing, sample and technical data.
      6.3.3. The requester, in conjunction with the appropriate fabricating section, identifies on the
      AFTO IMT 350 for local manufacture items requiring multiple section processing.
   6.4. Product Quality Deficiency Reports: (PQDR)
6                                                                AVIANOI23-102 8 FEBRUARY 2005


       6.4.1. The MSU forwards the draft PQDR with supporting data to QA. All CAT I PQDRs will be
       forwarded within 1-workday; CAT II PQDRs within 3-workdays. (See TO 00-35D-54 for instruc-
       tions).
       6.4.2. QA reports a CAT I PQDR within 2-workdays after discovery of the deficiency. Report
       serious safety hazards immediately by telephone or facsimile. Submit a CAT II within 13-work-
       days after discovery of the deficiency.
       6.4.3. Action Points promptly acknowledge receipt of all PQDRs within 1 working day for CAT I
       PQDRs and 10 calendar days for CAT II PQDRs. Each PQDR exhibit holding area will ship each
       exhibit within 2 (CAT I PQDR) or 3 work days (CAT II PQDR) after receipt of exhibit disposition
       instructions from the screening point, action or support point.
           6.4.3.1. Category I PQDR. A report of a deficiency, which if uncorrected, may cause:
               6.4.3.1.1. Death, severe injury or severe occupational illness.
               6.4.3.1.2. Major loss or damage to equipment or systems.
           6.4.3.2. Category II PQDR. A report of a deficiency, attributable to errors in workmanship,
           which if uncorrected, may cause nonconformance.
               6.4.3.2.1. 2LM Assets. Current standards for “pipeline performance” are: 2 calendar days
               (48 hours) for avionics components and 3 calendar days (72 hours) for engines. Pipeline
               performance is the sum of 2 segments of time. USAFE Base IMT 29, (See Attachment 2)
               will be used to track 2LM asset time buckets throughout the repair cycle process. The form
               is prepared in one copy and will process through the following 6 sections: flight line avi-
               onics, aircraft MSU, Integrated Avionics Intermediate Shop(IAIS), FSC, TMO and finally
               by the carrier. Each section that handles the 2LM asset will annotate the appropriate infor-
               mation on the USAFE Base IMT 29. The form is then forwarded back to the FSC for input
               into the IREP/2LM tracking data base program.
               6.4.3.2.2. Segment 1--The time a 2LM asset is removed from the aircraft, which includes
               troubleshooting, Can Not Duplicate (CND) screening and turn into the 31 LRS FSC.
NOTE: Segment 1--time ends when the 31LRS Outbound Cargo Element receives an asset.
               6.4.3.2.3. Segment 2--The time required for the Outbound Cargo Element to prepare and
               process the asset for shipment, which includes packaging, preparation, mode, carrier selec-
               tion and carrier pick-up.
NOTE: Segment 2--Time is computed from the time Outbound Cargo Element receives the asset until
the time the carrier picks up the asset.
    6.5. Processing Maintenance TRN Transactions. Treat items not having a demand placed on 31 LRS
    as TRN transactions and update CAMS and the SBSS for demand data update. Failure to update turn-
    around transactions can have a negative impact on stock effectiveness at base level. Failure to process
    TRNs affects stock levels and results in incomplete reports and figures in which AFMC bases its use,
    buy, repair and distribution decisions upon.
       6.5.1. The basic maintenance concept and parts ordering policy for repair cycle assets is to
       remove and replace the defective component with a serviceable asset issued from 31 LRS. The
       unserviceable asset is then processed for bench check and repair through the repair function.
AVIANOI23-102 8 FEBRUARY 2005                                                                         7


     Whenever assets are removed, bench checked, repaired and reinstalled without a demand on 31
     LRS, process a maintenance TRN transaction. Process a TRN when the following conditions
     exist:
         6.5.1.1. The component is integrated with another component and replacement dictates
         replacement of the other component.
         6.5.1.2. The defective component may require a minor repair while a new issue may need
         elaborate bench checking.
         6.5.1.3. The component is trimmed and fitted to the end item when the repair is determined as
         effective as a replacement.
         6.5.1.4. It’s easier to repair the defect on the equipment; in which case, a demand on 31 LRS
         is not required.
     6.5.2. Repair and return processing procedures are the same as normal reparable processing,
     except for annotating “TRN” in the AFTO IMT 350, Block 15, routing it through the MSU Mate-
     riel Control Element. If repaired, forward AFTO IMT 350 Part II to FSC for processing the TRN
     reparable generation demand data input. If repair cannot be accomplished, process and control the
     removed items as a normal DIFM item.
  6.6. Documenting Maintenance TRN Transactions. Processing a TRN provides the same demand
  data as turn-in of a serviceable asset issue from 31 LRS, maintenance repair and assembly that failed.
  Only maintenance action taken codes A, F, G, K, L or Z qualify for TRN transactions. The repair shop
  supervisor will act as the single point for processing AFTO IMT 350 TRN data to FSC and will
  assume the following duties and/or responsibilities.
     6.6.1. Ensure the FSC TRN monitor assigns a repair shop ID number to the maintenance activity.
     The FSC monitor must provide the name, duty location, phone number and mailing address uti-
     lized in processing TRN data or for resolving any related problems.
     6.6.2. Forward all AFTO IMT 350, Part II’s, requiring TRN processing to the FSC TRN monitor
     using the most expedient method available. Ensure the AFTO IMT 350 contain a valid part num-
     ber, national stock number, maintenance action taken code, the standard reporting designator of
     the weapon system or equipment from which the item was removed and number of repair days.
     6.6.3. Maintain a record of AFTO IMT 350, Part II’s forwarded to the FSC TRN monitor. The AF
     IMT 2521, Turnaround Transaction Log, may be used for this purpose. The form should contain
     at least the following specific entries:
         6.6.3.1. Stock number and/or part number.
         6.6.3.2. Total repair cycle days.
         6.6.3.3. Maintenance action taken code.
         6.6.3.4. AFTO IMT 350 tag number.
         FSC verifies transactions using I122 Mgt Notice.
