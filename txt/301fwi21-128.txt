1. General.
     1.1. 301st Maintenance Group Commander (301 MXG/CC) will ensure compliance with this
     directive.
     1.2. Anytime an EPU has been activated in-flight or on the ground, the aircraft will be
     inspected for the presence of hydrazine (H-70) by the Fire Department and then by the
     Hydrazine Response Team. After initial inspection the aircraft will be moved to an
     authorized, isolated area with a clear zone of 50 feet around the aircraft. If a major spill is
     confirmed (more than one pint); a distance of 600 feet downwind and 50 feet upwind is
     required. If the spill is inside a hangar, evacuate the hangar to the required distances by
     using the "Giant Voice" or hangar alarms. Open all doors and suspend all maintenance
     activities. WARNING: Maintenance personnel should not attempt to contain or
     neutralize a leak/spill themselves since specialized protective equipment is required.
2. Hydrazine Protective Equipment Requirements:
     2.1. Requirements for Use: Chemical Protective Clothing (CPC) will be evaluated against
     the hazards involved and the final decision on selection of CPC will rest with
     Bioenvironmental Engineering and the Hydrazine Team Chief. Generally, the Hydrazine
     Response Team will utilize the highest protection (level-A equipment) available when
     initially mitigating an incident. Level B equipment does not provide the same level of
     personnel protection and will only be utilized after the team chief performs an operational
     risk assessment.
        2.1.1. During emergency response, after Fire Department confirmation of hydrazine,
        Level-A equipment will be required. This equipment consists of boots, gloves, Self
        Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and totally encapsulated vapor tight suit.
        2.1.2. During EPU disconnects, EPU purge, spill containment, or clean-up, Level-A or B
        equipment will be required if hydrazine is noted.
        2.1.3. During disconnect of a fired EPU, SCBA respiratory protection is required.
        2.1.4. All maintenance performed inside the hydrazine facility will require the use of
        level-A or level-B equipment if hydrazine is suspected or confirmed.
        2.1.5. During hydrazine storage facility inspection, personnel will be required to wear at
        a minimum; gloves, apron and an in-line supplied air respirator or assure the ventilation
        is adequate by opening at least two doors for cross ventilation.
     2.2. Training: Only personnel who are trained and task certified will wear CPC. All
     personnel who respond to hydrazine incidents and who are subject to wear levelâ€“A or level-B
     CPC are required to attend task certification training prior to job placement and must attend
     refresher training annually. Training will be given by 301 Maintenance Squadron (301
     MXS) fuel system technicians and documented in IMDS upon completion.
     2.3. Care of Protective Equipment:
        2.3.1. Totally encapsulating suits will require annual visual and pressure checks in
        accordance with manufacturing instructions. Suits will be decontaminated after each use.
        Because of the 480-minute usage time of the suit, the user will be required to document
301FWI21-128 22 JUNE 2010                                                                     3


       the date, time and name of wearer prior to storage. All Level-A suits will be serial
       number controlled.
       2.3.2. SCBA will be checked after each use, prior to use and will have a monthly
       inspection. Cylinders will never be stored with less than full pressure. Re-service as
       required.
   2.4. Eyeglasses with straps or temple bars that pass through the face piece to face seal on
   SCBA mask are prohibited. If eyeglasses are required, contact Medical Services.
3. Procedures for Personnel Contaminated with H-70:
   3.1. Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will notify the Fire Department by calling 911.
   3.2. Personnel who have or may have inhaled H-70 MUST seek immediate medical
   attention.
   3.3. Personnel, who have had contact with hydrazine on their skin or clothing, will be
   evacuated from the spill area and proceed to the nearest source of water for decontamination.
   Medical attention will be sought as soon as possible.
   3.4. Contaminated clothing will be removed and the affected skin area will be flushed with
   large amounts of water for 15 minutes. The Hydrazine Response Team Chief will ensure the
   clothing is neutralized in accordance with T.O. 1F-16C-2-49GS-00-1.
   3.5. Eyes: Immediately flush with large amounts of water for a minimum of 15 minutes.
   Seek medical attention as soon as possible.
4. Fuel Shop Supervisor Responsibilities: The 301 MXS Fuel Shop Supervisor will ensure
assigned personnel have completed a pre-placement occupational physical examination and a
briefing on the health effects of H-70 prior to working with H-70. Ensure annual occupational
physicals for fuel systems repair personnel are scheduled and accomplished. Maintain at least
one H-70 kit (hydrazine response trailer) and the necessary technical data required for spill
management.
5. Hydrazine Response Team:
   5.1. The Hydrazine Response Team will consist of at least four individuals appointed by the
   301st Maintenance Squadron Commander (301 MXS/CC). The team will include two fully
   qualified Fuel System technicians and two additional team members or trained augmentees.
   The most senior of the Fuel Systems technicians on the team will be the Hydrazine Response
   Team Chief.
   5.2. A qualified Hydrazine Response Team will be on call via radio or telephone during
   normal duty hours. During non-duty hours the Base Fire Department (Host Navy) will be
   responsible for evacuation and containment of spills until a qualified team can be reached by
   telephone. A letter containing a list of personnel and their home telephone numbers to be
   contacted during off duty hours will be submitted by 301 MXS to the Base Fire Department
   (Host Navy) and MOC. This letter will be updated as changes occur.
   5.3. The Hydrazine Response Team will be responsible for detection, containment,
   neutralization, and clean up of any hydrazine spills, leaks or residues caused by EPU
   activation, providing the incident is within the organization's capabilities.
 4                                                                 301FWI21-128 22 JUNE 2010


        5.3.1. The Fuel System/Hydrazine Response Team will be responsible for all Level I
        (less than 1 pint) hydrazine incidents unless weather conditions or spill locations cause it
        to be beyond their capabilities. Examples are wet weather or when leaks are near storm
        drains.
        5.3.2. Spill containment and neutralization will be accomplished in accordance with T.O.
        1F-16C-2-49GS-00-1, using the two person concept with a two person back-up team
        standing no closer than 50 ft upwind of the site. The two working members will wear full
        protective clothing and SCBA.
        5.3.3. Whenever level-A equipment is required, two personnel (entrants) will be fully
        suited and an additional back-up team of two personnel will be half-suited in preparation
        for entry. The Base Fire Department EMS personnel will check vital signs on personnel
        pre and post entry of level-A suits. The Fire Department, Crash Recovery, and Support
        personnel will assist the Entry/Back-Up Team in donning CPC.
     5.4. When hydrazine is present, the Hydrazine Response Team will post signs indicating
     "KEEP OUT - Hydrazine Work in Progress." If spill, leak, or residue is in a hangar,
     adjoining offices within the cordon area (100 feet) will be evacuated. All office doors,
     including those outside the cordon area, must remain closed. When it is determined that a
     hydrazine leak is not present or the leak has been contained and neutralized and the aircraft is
     determined safe for maintenance, the aircraft will be moved to the designated fuel system
     maintenance "Safe" area for refurbishment and servicing of the Hydrazine System. The
     Hydrazine Response Team Chief will report to the On-Scene Commander before departing.
     5.5. Hydrazine Response Team Chief:
        5.5.1. The primary responsibility of the Hydrazine Response Team Chief is to take the
        Hydrazine Team into a hazardous environment, take appropriate action, and ensure the
        team is safely removed from the hazardous environment. The team chief ensures all
        proper equipment is on hand and all personal items are removed, tagged, and secured. He
        or she performs quality checks on SCBA and CPC between uses and records the serial
        numbers, time consumed and date of usage of the level-A hazard suits in a logbook.
        5.5.2. The H-70 Team Chief will notify MOC upon confirmation of any hydrazine leaks.
        5.5.3. The H-70 Team Chief will establish a safety area of 50 feet in all directions around
        the aircraft, with one entry point. Only persons authorized by the Team Chief will be
        allowed in this area.
        5.5.4. Because of the multiplicity of aircraft spill and leak situations which could occur,
        it is not possible to develop definite procedures for each possible situation. The
        Hydrazine Response Team Chief must assess each situation and add to or delete
        procedures using approved local checklists.
