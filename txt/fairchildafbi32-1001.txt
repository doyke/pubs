This instruction is to be used to prepare and process FAIRCHILDAFB Form 103, (FAFB Form 103) Base
Civil Engineer Work Clearance Request. Any agency that has to trench, hand dig, place an object into the
ground, interrupt utilities, or accomplish work that will affect vehicular or aircraft traffic flow will process
FAFB Form 103. This includes all required work, utility outages, disruptions of aircraft/vehicular traffic
flow, or where excavation of greater than six inches is required (whether accomplished in-house or by
self-help, contract, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (Prime BEEF), Rapid Engineers Deployable
Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineers (RED HORSE), Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve,
etc.). FAFB Form 103 is used to coordinate work-related activities with key base agencies. It is also used
to identify potentially hazardous work conditions. Normally, routine work clearance will take ten business
days to process and is valid for the number of days indicated by the approving official. Failure to comply
with this publication is punishable as a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)
and under all state and federal laws.

   and place one drawing(map) with part A and one with part B. Do not use blue, black, purple, green,
   pen or pencil to highlight dig locations. Requester should be sure to mark the area to be excavated/
   worked as accurate and to scale as possible. This will be the absolute limits of the excavation/work
   area. Pen or pencil may be used to annotate notes on the maps for greater clarification. Do not use any

    a copy of the site plan to the field.
    2.2.3. Coordinating agencies will clearly mark the location of their utilities within the construction
    area not later than 72 hours after the FAFB Form 103 coordination meeting and no later than 5 busi-

    sibility for implementation of this requirement.
    2.2.6. If a utility line is hit, regardless of fault, 92 CES/CEOC must be notified immediately. A meet-
    ing will occur within five business days of the incident to determine the cause of the utility line break

       2.3.2.2. Where the project requires a utility connection, 92 CES/CEO will provide manpower/
       equipment to locate the utility and verify location (to include depth.) The 92 CES/CEC project
       engineer will initiate a direct schedule work order to accomplish the required work.
       2.3.2.3. Upon completion of the project, the project manager will forward the as-built site plan to

       to ensure the utility site drawings are still current and correct with regard to additional in-house
       accomplished work. The FAFB Form 103 will be taken to the weekly coordination meeting to be
       initialed; this will serve as notice to all parties that the work is about to begin. The FAFB Form 103
       shall be annotated by 92 CES/CEC with the following note, “Approval based on designer verifica-
       tion of existing utilities. All utilities affecting this project are shown on the attached utility draw-
       ing. Contractor is responsible for maintaining marked location and protection of all utilities,” and
       approved by signing.
       2.3.3.2. Upon completion of the FAFB Form 103, 92 CES/CEOC will return the completed form
       to the project manager. Contractors are not allowed to conduct business through 92 CES/CEOC
       Customer Service. They must do all coordination through their assigned project/construction man-
       ager.
       2.3.3.3. Upon completion of work (identified on the FAFB Form 103), the project manager will
       forward as-built drawings to 92 CES/CEOG, who will update utility drawings to reflect the revised
       site conditions.

2.4. Utility Outages

   Plan.

2.5. Road Blocks
   2.5.1. FAFB Form 103 is required for all work that will include blocking or rerouting vehicular traffic

   cate that the work will also require blocking or rerouting traffic at the time the form is submitted. If the
   road blockage is not indicated on the original form, the requester is not authorized to block traffic.
   Blocking, partially blocking or rerouting traffic without prior coordination through 92 SFS/SFOXC
   and 92 CES/CEF via FAFB Form 103 shall not be permitted.
   2.5.3. When traffic is blocked, the requester must comply with all AMC traffic laws and all RCW
   laws, as applicable.

    nature and final processing. The requester has authority to implement expedient actions (immediate
    coordination) to meet emergency situations for safety, security, and mission. Projects behind schedule,
    poor planning practices and special favors do not warrant Emergency Work.

3.1. Instruction Violations
   3.1.1. If during the course of work any of the provisions found in this instruction are violated 92 CES/
   CEOC will immediately notify the site supervisor or project/construction manager. The senior official
   will immediately correct the situation and when the work is done by contract the project/construction
   manger will notify the contracting officer to halt all site operations pending investigation. If necessary,
   92 CES/CEOC (C.O. with contractors) will contact 92 SFS to assist in halting operations in the event

   enforcement agencies (Washington State Patrol or Spokane County Sheriff) may be required to assist
   92 SFS in halting operations.
   3.1.2. If a line was hit and the requester was determined by 92 CES/CEOC (or 92 CONS/Contracting
   Officer) to be at fault (paragraph 2.2.6.) they are responsible for all costs associated with expedient
   and permanent repairs of all damage. If original work was done by contract then 92 CONS/Contract-
   ing Officer may deduct the necessary amount off of the contract agreement to facilitate repairs.

3.2. Washington State Laws
