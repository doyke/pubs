                                           Chapter 1

                     BACKGROUND, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES

1.1. Background. The JOCAS II cost accounting system provides for the management of
support-funded resources, military pay, mission project costs by Job Order Number (JON)
(project receiving the product or service), and by the organization providing the resources. The
system separately accounts for range mission and center activities. AFMCI 65-602, Uniform
Reimbursement and Pricing Procedures, Foreign Military Sales and other reimbursements,
pertains to Eglin. This instruction implements this directive at Eglin AFB.
1.2. Purpose. This instruction implements a uniform cost accounting structure and system for
recording and reporting cost and for tracking and reimbursable purposes. It provides guidance for
the following:
    1.2.1. Meeting financial information requirements, including recurring reports, special
    requirements, inquiries from higher headquarters, budget information, programming data,
    manpower requirements, trend analysis, and workload analysis.
    1.2.2. Providing operational-level management tools to instill an awareness of total costs of
    individual segments of the overall mission, better management of resources, and financial
    data for decision making.
    1.2.3. Providing a method of recording cost transactions by job order (cost objective) to
    identify cost reimbursable transactions in support of reimbursement policy, as stated in
    AFMCI 65-602, DODD 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facilities Base, and DOD 7000.14,
    Volume 4, DOD Financial Management Regulation, Accounting Policy and Procedures.
1.3. JOCAS II Objectives:
    1.3.1. Provide organizational managers at all levels accurate cost information pertaining to
    the resources used by their organization and the purpose for which the resources were used in
    order to:
       Improve the financial management of their organization.
       Estimate the resources needed to perform a specific task.
       Justify their annual requirement for resources.
    1.3.2. Provide the project manager with accurate cost data to assist in the financial
    management of their projects by JON.
    1.3.3. Promote the need for financial management at all levels.
    1.3.4. Provide collection of costs for billing of reimbursements earned.
    1.3.5. Provide a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) capability that captures costs to support
    JON cost estimates.
    1.3.6. Provide the capability for extracting data from JOCAS II tables to support local
    Management Information Systems (MIS) applications, ACCESS Links, and other report
    requirements.
EGLINAFBI65-601 5 JANUARY 2009                                                                     3


1.4. Description of the Job Order Cost Accounting System (JOCAS II). JOCAS II is a
standard cost accounting system developed and maintained by the Programs Management Office
(PMO) located at Wright-Patterson AFB (HQ AFMC/FMPT). It is an expense accumulation
system designed to identify total resources expended in the completion of a job order by type of
resource Element of Expense Investment code (EEIC), by performing organization
Responsibility Center/Cost Center (RC/CC), and by source of Financing-Fund Code (FC).
JOCAS II is an extension of the General Accounting and Finance System (GAFS), which
accumulates expenses by RC/CC and EEIC. JOCAS II features include:
   1.4.1. Accumulation of costs by JON and accounting classification.
   1.4.2. On-line access to detailed transaction data at the working level (prior to approval), at
   the history level (after approval), and at the cumulative level (summary level to support
   reporting/JV/billing).
1.5. Eglin JOCAS II Structure. The Eglin job order cost accounting process currently includes
the following organizations and cost accounting structure: (See figures 1.1 and 1.2).
   1.5.1. Account ID (AID) ―E1.‖ This AID applies to the 46th Test Wing (46 TW) test and
   evaluation activity. The 46 TW performs tasks which have associated direct, indirect, and
   overhead costs and are all accumulated by JON.
   1.5.2. AID ―EA.‖ This AID applies to 96th Air Base Wing (96 ABW). The functions are
   mainly overhead/Base Operating Support (BOS). Costs reported to a reimbursable JON
   utilize the JOCAS II automated billing process.
   1.5.3. AID ―EZ.‖ This AID applies to associate/tenant (53d Wing and AAC A&AS
   activities) units. Only costs reported to a reimbursable JON utilize the JOCAS II automated
   billing process. Journal voucher processing to ensure accuracy of appropriate accounting data
   in GAFS Direct Budget Authority (DBA) versus Reimbursable Budget Authority (RBA) is
   the responsibility of the associate.
   1.5.4. AID ―EQ.‖ This AID applies to Air Armament Center acquisition and support
   activities. Only costs reported to a reimbursable JON utilize the JOCAS II automated billing
   process.
1.6. JOCAS II Operation. JOCAS II is an on-line processing system (allowing for some batch
processing) that provides for different stages of data entry, data approval, and data base (table)
maintenance. All transactions processed on-line (cost, labor, or products and services) are
recorded in working tables and can be modified by the responsible organization/personnel until
approved by that organization. The transactions are then moved to history tables (individual
transactions maintained with same level of detail as originally processed) and can only be
modified through standard JOCAS II correction procedures as documented in the JOCAS II
Users Guide (on-line). Transactions from standard interfacing systems (GAFS, Interim
Workorder Information Management System (IWIMS), or Standard Base Supply System
(SBSS)) and contractor data (when approved by Audit Agency Certification) are loaded directly
into history tables, skipping working tables, and approval process. The JOCAS II office, on a
semi-monthly basis executes consolidation processing to move transactions to a cumulative table
(transactions are consolidated at this stage but details are still maintained in the history tables),
maintained by month (1st day of each month) for the purpose of supporting report and billing
processes.

                           JON MANAGEMENT AND CODING

3.1. Workload Acceptance. Acceptance of workload at Eglin is decentralized. Responsibilities
for accepting, documenting, and coordinating workload are as follows:
   3.1.1. The following organizations accept workloads and perform JON management
   responsibilities.
       3.1.1.1. Test and Evaluation (T&E). The 46 TW has overall responsibility for the T&E
       mission and perform JON management responsibilities. The responsibility for acceptance
       of specific workload is outlined in AFDTCI 99-102, AAC Test and Evaluation Workload
       Acceptance, Coordination, and Documentation.
       3.1.1.2. Computer Science Workload. 46 RANG/VTS is responsible for acceptance of
       workload in the computer science area including missile simulation model development,
       computer hardware design and utilization, software development, and data reduction and
       analysis.
       3.1.1.3. Special Category Workload. 96th Comptroller Squadron (96 CPTS/FMA) is
       designated OPR on an exception basis for workload in the categories of base civil
       engineer work orders, transportation costs, etc., that are not covered in the development
       and testing workload.
       3.1.1.4. Air Armament Center provides system program management and direction for
       the validation, full-scale engineering development, and initial production phase activities
       related to acquisition of air-to-surface ballistic weapons, guided air-to-surface weapons,
       advanced medium range air-to-air missiles, air base survivability and recovery systems,
       non-nuclear munitions, guns, and ammunition, targets, and related support equipment.
3.2. Organizational Responsibilities. All workload accepted and performed by the 46 TW is
documented by a task or a test directive and must be assigned a JON under the provisions of this
regulation. The Air Armament Center, associate units, A&AS acitivities, and 96th Air Base
Wing assign JONs only to the reimbursable workload of these activities. See chapter 2 for
further definition of OPR responsibility.
3.3. JON Assignment. There are three basic types of JONs; reimbursable direct, non-
reimbursable direct, and indirect. The formatting of each of these types of JONs differs. JONs
will be assigned according to the following guidelines. OPRs will use these guidelines when
establishing proposed JONs.
   3.3.1. Direct Job Orders. Direct JONs will be assigned to all work requirements in support of
   specific research & development programs; work in support of agencies external to AAC
   with the exception of AFMC directed efforts (such as preparation of the AAC Resources Plan
   or Range Improvement Program); and work subject to reimbursement according to directed
   reimbursement policies. A direct non-reimbursable JON is defined and established as a direct
   JON. The direct JONs (eight-digit alpha/numeric codes (no alpha Os in last four digits)) will
   be assigned as shown in the following examples:
10                                                       EGLINAFBI65-601 5 JANUARY 2009


       3.3.1.1. Numbering structure for AID E1 (T&E resources): JONs consist of eight digits.
       The first digit describes the major customer category (table 3-1). The second digit further
       describes an Air Force customer (table 3.2). The third digit is considered a filler (Z).
       Finally, the fourth digit is the test manager’s organization (table 3-3). Digits 5-8 provides

   3.3.2. Indirect Job Orders. Indirect JONs are assigned to all management, administration and
   planning functions, leave, and other work efforts which require tracking and cannot be
   identified to a specific research development test & evaluation (RDT&E) effort or to a
   specific customer request. Indirect JONs, except for those assigned to capital investment
   items, leave and rate validation, begin with 999. Work directive documentation is not
   required to establish an indirect JON.
       3.3.2.1. General Indirect JONs. These numbers are established in broad categories of
       indirect effort and may be used by all organizations. Should further identification of
       indirect efforts be required, additional JONs can be established. For a specific indirect
       JON, see paragraph 3.3.2.2. The general indirect numbers are as follows:
             3.3.2.1.1. Management/Supervision (9991XXXX). Resources expended on
             management of technical and general mission activities, which contribute to the
             overall mission but are not directly, related to a specific RDT&E job order. The
             control and planning functions of management are emphasized in this account with
             the principal components being personnel supervision, planning for new work, long-
             range program planning, management analysis, conferences, and briefings. Most
             expended labor of the Commander, the Executive Director, division and branch
             chiefs, and personnel of certain staff offices (plan, operations, technical applications,
             and executive) will fall in this account.
             3.3.2.1.2. Administrative (9992XXXX). Resources expended on the routine
             operation of the activity; such as preparation or review of personnel records and job
             descriptions; career counseling; fund drives; tours and public information; and typing,
             filing, and stenographic duties.
             3.3.2.1.3. Technical Support (9993XXXX). Resources expended on work such as
             procurement, supply, safety, data collection and processing, PME, and facility
             maintenance, which contribute to many RDT&E job orders.
             3.3.2.1.4. Training (9994XXXX). Resources expended on work such as attendance
             of PME, driving safety, disaster preparedness, long-term study programs and
             seminars or symposia to maintain or upgrade job-related proficiency.
       3.3.2.2. Specific Indirect JONs. Specific indirect JONs are established to track individual
       indirect efforts when management desires a further breakout of the general indirect JON.
       The basic structure for the indirect JON is as shown in table 3.4.

        3.3.2.3. Indirect JONs for Planning Efforts. Long-range planning efforts will be reported
        under the management/supervision (9991XXXX) category. CAO will assign the last four
        digits according to instructions from the OPR responsible for the planning effort.
     3.3.3. Annual Leave. Annual leave for civilian and military personnel:
        99054000 - Civilian.
        99954000 - Military
     3.3.4. Sick Leave. Sick leave for civilian and military personnel:
        99055000 - Civilian
        99955000 - Military
     3.3.5. Other Leave. Holidays, jury duty, Reserve or National Guard duty, administrative
     leave etc.:
        99056000 – Civilian
        99956000 - Military
     3.3.6. Rate Validation Job Orders. Rate validation JONs (997XXXXX) are established for
     the accumulation of actual process costs when the product and service method of cost
     accounting is used to identify costs to direct JONs. JONs will be initiated by organization
     upon the assignment of the standard price code. Cross-references of Standard Price Code and
     Rate Validation JON are contained in the Standard Rate Price Catalog.
3.4. Method of Input. Use JOCAS on-line input procedures (see JOCAS Users Guide (on-
line)). The 46 TW may use the daily flat file update to insert/update JONs, WBSs, and WBS
titles. The data in these files will be verified for accuracy then used to update the applicable
database table(s). If they have inserts or updates to process, the 46 TW will prepare and copy
these files into the /j2_release/xfer directory on the JOCAS computer prior to 1630 that workday.
Then, at 16:30, the process will determine the existence of the files and process the necessary
verification, inserts, and updates.

                        EXPENSE ACCUMULATION/CORRECTION

4.1. General. JOCAS II accumulates expenses/costs from various sources of input. Labor, cost,
and product and service charges are recorded directly into JOCAS II via on-line processing.
Range contractor and Photo Lab costs (labor, cost, and product and service) are output from the
contractor’s Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) certified accounting systems in a specified
file format and batch processed into the JOCAS II. JOCAS II also extracts data from various
standard systems (GAFS, SBSS, and IWIMS) via interface processes.
4.2. JOCAS II On-Line Processes. JOCAS II provides on-line processing for user
organizations to input labor, cost, and product and service charges. JOCAS II provides hard copy
users guide and various on-line help features. On-line edits are performed on all transactions
when entered and must be corrected prior to acceptance into JOCAS II. On-line transactions are
maintained in a working table until approved by designated person(s) within the organization.
Data can be viewed or reported upon entry into the working tables and from that point forward.
     4.2.1. Labor Processing. Each organization will establish procedures to ensure all labor is
     properly and timely recorded in JOCAS II. The organization will designate and establish
     labor entry personnel and labor approval personnel following procedures outlined in the
     JOCAS II Users Guide (on-line). The Eglin JOCAS II Business Practice requires all labor to
     be entered and approved not later than the third workday following the end of each pay
     period. All labor costs will be input via standard labor procedures (only exception is that
     some labor is included in product and service rates) and not by cost entry processing.
     4.2.2. Cost Processing. Cost entry transactions may be processed only when other standard
     procedures cannot be followed. Each organization must support the validity of their inputs
     and record the transaction entry person’s name in the remarks field. Each organization must
     designate and establish cost entry personnel following the procedures outlined in the JOCAS
     II Users Guide (on-line). Cost entry transactions are approved by the CAO. They are not to
     be used to correct errors created by other entry procedures. CAO will approve redistribution
     of costs from standard systems when original systems cannot support multiple JONs (such as
     government credit cards). The CAO must be notified of these situations. Cost entries must be
     supported with documentation maintained by organization.
     4.2.3. Product and Service Process. Each organization is responsible for ensuring all product
     and service charges are properly and timely recorded in JOCAS II. The organization must
     designate and establish product and service entry, and approval personnel as outlined in the
     JOCAS II Users Guide (on-line). All product and service charges must be input via the on-
     line procedures, except for contractor-established product and service rates that use the
     contractor upload process. Cost transaction processing cannot be used to input, reverse, or
     correct product and service entries.
4.3. Contractor Upload Processing. This process is available only for contractors with
accounting systems approved by DCAA. JOCAS II accepts a standard record format that is batch
processed into JOCAS II via a Contractor Upload process. See Table 4.1 The contractor record
allows for labor, cost and product and service charges to be entered into JOCAS II.
EGLINAFBI65-601 5 JANUARY 2009                                                                       15


4.4. JOCAS II Interfacing Processes. JOCAS II extracts data from other interfacing systems
(GAFS, SBSS and IWIMS). This extracted data includes only expended amounts (services or
materials delivered). Commitments and obligations are not extracted. Example: Supply due-outs
or the reservation of funds in GAFS for travel/transportation (Fund Cite Authorizations and Fund
Control Numbers commit funds and all other documents processed by travel expense funds) or
contracts prior to the expenditure stage.
   4.4.1. Travel Expenses. For AID E1, Travel Orders must reflect a JON in the accounting
   classification (figure 4.1). JOCAS II will extract travel expenses from GAFS and charge the
   appropriate JON.
   4.4.2. Transportation Expenses. Transportation by commercial carrier was obtained with
   Government Bill of Lading (GBL) prepared by the transportation officer. Power Track is
   used to track and pay transportation expenses. The initiator of a request for transportation
   will include the valid JON (AID E1) on the request. Transportation can be requested on DD
   Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document; DD Form 1348-1A, Item
   Release/Receipt Document; or by letter. The JON will be entered in block 4 of DD Form
   1149 and in block 13 of DD Form 1348-1A in the following manner:
JON ( ---- *------)
* Enter valid eight-digit JON. If the request for transportation is submitted by letter, include a
separate paragraph stating JON.

 NOTE: Detailed instructions on the identification of expenses to final cost objectives
 are presented in succeeding paragraphs.


        4.4.2.1. The transportation officer, in preparing the GBL, will include the JON for AID
        E1 in the accounting classification immediately following the station code.
Example: 57*3600 29* 4721 696997 7JTW3R 462 503000 ABZG1009
               (Accounting Classification)            (JON)
        4.4.2.2. Anytime a fund citation is issued to another installation for transportation in
        direct support of a job order, the accounting classification will include the JON as shown
        above.
   4.4.3. Contract Service Expense. The 46 TW contract service expense data requires the
   originator of the procurement document to include a valid JON or work order number for
   96th Civil Engineering in all citations of 57X3600 appropriations as outlined in figure 4.1.
   The 46 TW contract services for indirect support should use the appropriate 999XXXXX
   indirect JON. The following are examples of the procurement documents:
        4.4.3.1. AF Form 9, Request for Purchase. (Enter JON in the total block directly below
        the description of sources.)
        4.4.3.2. AF Form 185, Project Order. (Enter JON in lower left corner next to form
        number.)

        4.4.3.3. AF Form 830, Procurement Directive. (Enter JON in upper left corner next to
        form number.)
        4.4.3.4. AFMC Form 36, Purchase Request. (Enter JON in upper left corner to left of
        title.)
        4.4.3.5. DD Form 448, Military Inter-Departmental Purchase Request. (Enter JON in
        description block.)
        4.4.3.6. AFMC Form 277, Reimbursable Order/Request For Support From Other
        Agencies. (Enter JON in first 12 positions of the description block.)
     4.4.4. Supply Expenses. Supplies used in support of a job order can be obtained from four
     sources: direct requisition from Base Supply; bench stock; local purchase outside of Base
     Supply; and from stock on hand. The source of the supply will determine the method of
     inputting its cost into JOCAS II.
        4.4.4.1. Base Supply. Supplies are requisitioned from Base Supply by submitting an AF
        Form 2005, Issue/Turn-In Request, to the Demand Processing Element. The originator
        may complete this form or the required information may be called in. A JON is required
        for AID E1, it may be included in the remarks field. If called in, the Supply Technician
        will request a JON from the caller.
            4.4.4.1.1. If supplies are for other than direct support of a job order for AID E1, use
            the JON of the appropriate indirect (999XXXXX) number when ordering supplies.
            4.4.4.1.2. Supplies purchased for AID E1 through the Retail Sales Section will be
            treated as an indirect cost and allocated to direct JONs as overhead unless the Sales
            Store Issue Slip contains a valid JON.
            4.4.4.1.3. AID E1 supply costs with JONs will enter JOCAS II via the SBSS
            interface. JOCAS II office will send out correction notices with a 15-day suspense.
        4.4.4.2. Bench Stock. Bench stock consists of stores of high usage, low cost items held in
        the organization to carry on the day-to-day operations. These items are charged to the
        organization at the time the bench stock is replenished. Bench stock is an institutional
        cost of operating under NDAA (AID E1).
        4.4.4.3. Local Purchase. In preparing an AF Form 9 for supplies to be used in AID E1
        for direct support of a specific customer JON, the initiator must include the valid JON in
        the total block (directly below the description of services). This job order must be
        included in the accounting classification on the contracting document resulting from the
        AF Form 9.
        4.4.4.4. From Stock on Hand. Replacement cost of equipment/supplies used from stock
        for a test will be input to JOCAS II as outlined in paragraph 4.4.4.2. SMA, columns 1-6,
        should read "USESTK." This procedure is necessary, as the replacement item often does
        not arrive before the JON is closed. The AF Form 2005 used to order the replacement
        item should include the appropriate JON in the remarks section.
     4.4.5. Equipment Expense. When accountable equipment is used in AID E1 for direct
     support of a specific customer JON, the initiator must include the JON in Block 21 of the AF
EGLINAFBI65-601 5 JANUARY 2009                                                                  19


  Form 601, Equipment Action Request. For non-accountable equipment enter the JON in the
  remarks section of the AF Form 2005. Refer to para 4.4.4.4 for equipment used from stock.
  4.4.6. Standard Output Expenses (Product and Service Accounting)(AID E1 only). The
  product and services (P&S) method of cost accounting accumulates costs based on a cost per
  unit to produce a product or service. This cost is identified to a JON based on the number of
  units required to complete the job. The P&S method of cost accounting should be used when
  a cost center produces a homogenous product or service. P&S accounting requires a P&S rate
  to be established, which identifies all costs associated with the production of one unit of
  output (for example, labor, supplies, etc.). As units of P&S are accomplished, the quantity of
  units is processed against the P&S rate table to arrive at total costs and labor hours applicable
  to the JON. Use of this process can significantly simplify planning, programming, budgeting,
  estimating, and accounting functions. The product/service/standard rates are established and
  monitored using the procedures outlined in AFMCI 65-602, Uniform Reimbursement and
  Pricing Procedures.
  4.4.7. Error Corrections. Errors may be identified by routine edits accomplished by JOCAS
  II during processing, or functional managers during their evaluation processes may identify
  them. If errors are discovered by JOCAS II and the correction is not obvious, the information
  will be furnished to the functional manager. The functional manager will ascertain the correct
  data and return to JOCAS II. Sometimes this will require that the functional manager corrects
  data for which he or she was not directly responsible. For example, although a supply
  requisition was incorrectly keypunched into Standard Base Supply System, only the
  organization ordering the supply against a direct effort is able to make a correction.
     4.4.7.1. Suspected errors that are uncovered as a result of the functional manager's
     review and evaluation process will be identified to the JOCAS office either informally
     (by telephone or in person) or through official correspondence. The JOCAS office can
     assist in researching the transaction and may advise the functional manager of necessary
     adjustments required by the functional manager to correct errors.
     4.4.7.2. No cost center is authorized to correct another cost center's data. The cost center
     showing an erroneous JON, etc., must be contacted to make the correction.

                      INDIRECT/OVERHEAD RATE DEVELOPMENT

5.1. Indirect and Overhead. JOCAS II computes and applies indirect/overhead rates (AID E1
only) based on the Direct Cost allocation method depicted below:
                     Pool of Indirect Cost
                     Total Direct Cost
     5.1.1. JOCAS II computes an indirect rate (civilian/other and military) by dividing the total
     indirect cost (dollar value of indirect JONs) by total direct costs. The indirect rate is applied
     or charged to each applicable RC/CC on a direct cost basis.
     5.1.2. JOCAS II computes an overhead rate (civilian/other and military) by dividing the total
     overhead cost (dollar value of overhead costs extracted from GAFS) by direct costs. The
     overhead rate is applied or charged to each applicable RC/CC based direct cost basis.
     5.1.3. JOCAS II also computes a Base Operating Support (BOS) overhead rate, by using the
     criteria in paragraph 5.1.2. except the overhead cost pool is completely extracted from GAFS
     (no JON costs, meaning these RC/CCs do not have to input labor to JOCAS II).
     5.1.4. JOCAS II accumulates the overhead rate and BOS overhead rate and applies the
     aggregate rate to all direct JON cost.
     5.1.5. Indirect and overhead calculation by JOCAS II requires proper classification of all
     RC/CCs and proper identification of costs are essential to rate calculation, as well as proper
     cost accumulation/accounting.

BILLING, JV AND REIMBURSABLE ORDER NUMBER (RON) MANAGEMENT AND
                             CODING

6.1. Billing Procedures. An automated billing module is maintained within JOCAS II and is
available to all JOCAS II users. The billing documents are created by CAO and forwarded to
DFAS for collection. Customer organization OPRs are responsible for assuring that charges are
accumulated in JOCAS II only against funding documents that bear adequate balances on the
reimbursement side as well as the disbursement side of BQ.
   6.1.1. SF 1080s are created from the standard JOCAS II billing process after close of
   business end of each month, except October bills are processed with November bills.
   6.1.2. SF 1080 summary-billing backup is created by CAO to explain the costs identified on
   the SF 1080, Voucher for Transfers Between Appropriations and/or Funds to the customer.
   6.1.3. SF 1080 data is generated and forwarded to DFAS via DTIMS. The CAO uploads
   standard required data into the JOCAS II CoP each month upon completion of the bill
   transmissions to DFAS.
   6.1.4. Customer reports are prepared by CAO for such things as deferrals, earnings, and job
   order status reports and funds summaries. User OPRs are urged to refer to progress of
   billings through BQ to assure DFAS has received all necessary support.
6.2. Bill Corrections are processed to correct erroneous bills.
   6.2.1. Bill corrections may be initiated by either the user organization or JOCAS II CAO.
   When user organization requires CAO to make correction, they are urged to send a written
   request to CAO stating why the correction is required.
   6.2.2. When the bill correction is generated, the correct funding document is sequenced to
   receive the reprocessed expenses. This will prevent rebilling of the same funding document.
   6.2.3. The results of the bill correction will be seen within the next billing cycle.
6.3. JOCAS JV. Replenishes Direct Billing Authority (DBA) with Reimbursable Billing
Authority (RBA). This JV is processed on the disbursement side and coincides with the
processing of the SF1080 billings.
6.4. Reimbursable Order Number (RON) Management. JOCAS II accepts MIPRs (DD
Form 448), Project Orders (AF Form 185) and RREO's (AFMC Form 277) as reimbursable
orders in JOCAS II.
   6.4.1. Customers are discouraged from using any type of direct cite funding documents, to
   include AF Forms 616, Fund Cite Authorization (FCA). AF Forms 616 will only be accepted
   on a case by case basis and are highly discouraged. This is because other funding documents,
   such as AF Forms 616 are not set up correctly in BQ to be billed as a reimbursable document
   and are suppose to be used for contractual obligations billed through IAPS, rather than the SF
   1080 billing process that JOCAS uses. The JON Manager risks not receiving their
   reimbursement if their customers do not send their funds on a correct reimbursement
   document.
22                                                      EGLINAFBI65-601 5 JANUARY 2009


     6.4.2. Funding documents can only have one line of accounting entered. Due to
     programming limitations within JOCAS, only enter one fund cite per document. Funding
     documents can only be loaded to one AID. If the customers need to send money to multiple
     AID's, they need to prepare separate funding documents.
6.5. JON Funding Transfers. Transfers among JON's may only be made within the same AID
and RMB code. The customer organization that provided the funding document must approve of
any redirection of funds differing from the JON distribution directed by their original funding
document.
     6.5.1. AID EQ, EZ and EA, the RCCC must also match. There is no change to BQ when a
     transfer is made. JON Transfer requests must be accomplished using the JON Transfer
     program located on the FM homepage.
     6.5.2. JOCAS Rolls. The FUNDING MANAGER that issues the original funding document
     is responsible for researching their appropriation and fiscal law regulations to ensure their
     funds are legally able to be rolled into subsequent fiscal years for expenditure. After they
     have ascertained the legality of rolling their funds, they must ensure the period of
     performance (POP) on their document extends into the fiscal year they are rolling their funds
     into, and amend their funding document, if necessary. Once the POP has been extended, the
     JON manager must submit a roll request using the JON transfer program located on the FM
     homepage.
        6.5.2.1. Once, a year, approximately November, the JOCAS CAO will roll all
        unobligated funds in AID E1, which have the appropriate POP, into the next fiscal year.
        Any rolls that are required after that date, must be requested through the JON Transfer
        program.
6.6. RMB Code Decision. Determined by the JON manager when they build the JON. A
complete listing and description of the RMB codes can be found on the FM homepage, JOCAS
reports, "How to Determine a Reimbursement Code." A dummy MORD with the corresponding
RMB code will be inserted in the JON Master when the JON manager builds the JON.
     6.6.1. For auditing purposes, the JON manager must ensure they have back up
     documentation to support their decision of which RMB code to use on the JON.
     6.6.2. If a RMB code needs to be changed, the customer must contact the JOCAS office for
     further assistance.
6.7. Prepaid Checks To JONs. The customer that receives the check must prepare two copies
of a DD Form 2658 to accompany the original check.
     6.7.1. Customers are responsible for delivering a COPY of the check (annotated with the
     JON) to the JOCAS office (either by fax, e-mail or in person) so the check can be entered in
     JOCAS II and GAFS.
     6.7.2. Customer will hand carry the DD Form 2658, Return and Undeliverable Check/Bond
     Record, and the original check to the 96 CPTS cashier cage. The 96th CPTS cage personnel
     sign the DD Form 2658 acknowledging receipt of the check, and the customer is given a
     copy of the DD Form 2658.
     6.7.3. The JOCAS office will prepare a DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, and
     deliver to the CPTS cage along with loading the funds in JOCAS and BQ.
