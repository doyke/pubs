correspondence to 12 point; changes the suspense time for responding to 4-star correspondence to 5 workdays and read-ahead
requirements to 1 day for the Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF) and 2 days for the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF)
prior to the event; changes the date format for SecAF correspondence; adds punctuation to salutation and complimentary
closing for CSAF and Command Section personal memos; adds business rules for use of the Task Management Tool (TMT);
and makes action officer (AO) training mandatory for all newly arrived AOs.

                                                               Chapter 1

                                                     GENERAL GUIDANCE
1.1. Responsibilities Assigned:

       1.1.1. Headquarters Air Force Executive Secretariat (HAF/ES) has overall responsibility for correspondence
management and preparation within the HAF. HAF/ES will:

                   1.1.1.1. Provide guidance and assistance on correspondence preparation for HAF. Receive, control and
distribute Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF), Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF), Under Secretary of the Air Force
(USecAF), Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force (VCSAF) (Top 4) and Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force (AVCSAF)
correspondence, as appropriate.

               1.1.1.2. Serve as correspondence control and task liaison between HAF, Office of the Secretary of Defense
(OSD) Correspondence Control Division (CCD) and the OSD Executive Secretariat (ES).

                   1.1.1.3. Assign tasks on behalf of the Top 4 and AVCSAF after receipt of task instructions from their
respective offices.

                           1.1.1.3.1. Before task assignment, HAF/ES will conduct research to preclude task duplication and to
locate and reference past or related work.

                          1.1.1.3.2. As a general rule, task assignment will occur within 24 hours of receipt of task
instructions. However, time-critical task items will be assigned upon receipt.

                           1.1.1.3.3. Task instructions will include at a minimum: specific actions required to complete the
task, a task summary of the task at hand, references to related past work, OPR and OCR agencies, links to associated
documents, and a minimum coordination and staffing recommendation.

                 1.1.1.4. Monitor the status of task actions, provide assistance on due date extensions, assist with retrieving
packages held up in coordinating offices, and assist OPRs in reassignment of erroneously assigned actions.

                   1.1.1.5. Process staff packages destined for the Top 4 and AVCSAF; review for clarity and administrative
quality to ensure correspondence meets requirements of this Operating Instruction; ensure accurate staff package location
information is available to HAF agencies; and ensure correspondence answers the tasking.

            1.1.2. Secretariat and Air Staff 2-Letter offices will:

                   1.1.2.1. Develop a consistent, coherent, and coordinated staffed package and assign actions through
controlled, established procedures within their directorates, assist in determining the proper reply to complete a task (e.g.,
memorandum, flag, or personalized letter), and provide additional task instructions as appropriate.

                1.1.2.2. Ensure correspondence is essential, timely, well organized, and that thorough HAF coordination has
been completed. Correspondence should be processed electronically unless a paper copy is more appropriate.

              1.1.2.3. Comply with security classification and safeguarding according to AFI 31-401, Information Security
Program Management.

                 1.1.2.4. Meet established due date; maintain or have access to the status of actions to ensure timely
submission of replies; and return staff packages returned for corrections within 24 hours to HAF/ES.

                 1.1.2.5. Forward extension or transfer requests to HAF/ES as soon as possible, providing sound rationale.
An interim response is required on all extension requests when possible. (Reference para 6.1.8 to 6.1.10.)

                     1.1.2.6. Ensure HAF/ES receives task status updates during the life cycle of each task when it affects the
timeline.


                                                                      4
                 1.1.2.7. Ensure office organizational inboxes are established and managed for notification or receipt of
incoming task and packages. These boxes should be monitored the first duty hour, throughout the day, and before departure of
personnel responsible for managing tasks.

         1.1.3. Action Officers (AOs) will:

                   1.1.3.1. Attend mandatory AO training provided by the HAF Learning Organization (HAF/ESL). AOs may
sign up for training on the HAF/ESL Learning Management System (LMS) https://ncr-lms.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp web
site. Training is conducted monthly and schedules may be found on the HAF/ES web site. AOs are exempt from training only
if their supervisors determine their expected duties will not require any correspondence staffing processes.

                 1.1.3.2. Be responsible for staff actions from cradle to grave—action not complete until signed and response
has been dispatched to final action agency.

                  1.1.3.3. Ensure proper coordination and completion of the action. Coordinate actions as fully as possible, but
without permitting the coordination process to cause the action to evade the issues, provide watered-down advice to achieve
consensus, or miss the established due date. Through the coordination process, critical issues can be identified and presented to
the AO’s leadership for decision. The AO is responsible for ensuring such issues are identified and not lost through vague
wording or a compromise on the objective of the action. The AO should balance the objective of producing "the perfect action"
against the need to complete work in a timely manner.

                  1.1.3.4. Ensure classified information is appropriately marked in accordance with AFI 31-401.

                   1.1.3.5. Ensure their directorate chain of command (and HAF/ES, as appropriate) receives task status updates
during the life cycle of each task.

                  1.1.3.6. Make corrections on staff packages returned for corrections and return packages to HAF/ES within
24 hours.




                                                                5
                                                            Chapter 2

                                                      WRITING STYLE
2.1. Active Voice. Use the active voice in correspondence by ensuring the following:

         2.1.1. Use active voice with the correct actor – action – object sentence structure.

         2.1.2. Avoid the passive voice that occurs when you separate the actor and action, for example: "A new medal has
been established to recognize civilians by the Secretary of the Air Force." The actor, "Secretary of the Air Force" and action,
"established," occupy different parts of the sentence.

         2.1.3. Create the active voice by reuniting actor with the action following: "The Secretary of the Air Force has
established a new medal to recognize civilians."

         2.1.4. Sentences always include an actor, whether an organization, individual, or an abstract idea.

         2.1.5. Avoid writing sentences that lack actors. For example, the sentence, "New guidance regarding Internet security
has been established," does not tell the reader who established the new policy.

         2.1.6. Create a direct message by adding the appropriate actor, for example: "The Chief Information Officer has
established a new guidance regarding Internet security."

2.2. Strong, Active Words

          2.2.1. Refrain from using empty actors, such as "it is," "there are," and all their variations, as they interfere with
clarity. For example, the phrase "It is" in the sentence, "It is recommended that Headquarters US Air Force implement the
system," links empty subjects without adding value and does not tell the reader who recommends.

       2.2.2. Write direct messages by using actors that add substance to your meaning, for example, "We recommend that
Headquarters US Air Force implement the system." Or, depending on the meaning, you could write, "The Director of Personnel
recommends that Headquarters US Air Force implement the system."

2.3. Clear Instead of Hidden Verbs

         2.3.1. Do not use hidden verbs, such as "implementation," "performance" and "determination," that refer to actions but
masquerade as nouns. For example, "Implementation of new building security procedures is currently underway," does not
clarify who is implementing.

         2.3.2. Clarify the meaning and make sure to include the appropriate content by inserting the actors and recasting the
hidden verb as the action it actually represents: "The Pentagon Security Services is currently implementing new building
security procedures."

2.4. Concise Word Use. Write concisely by avoiding unnecessary little words.

        2.4.1. Be careful of little word build up that results from passivity, fluffy phrases, and poor sentence structure, as
shown here: "It has been determined that a review of the new protocol must be made in order to determine our best strategy for
moving forward." (24 words)

          2.4.2. Instead, cut extra and unnecessary words, such as "it has been...," "... a review of...," and "...must be made in
order to..." to create a tighter, more direct message like this: "The AF/A1 has determined that we must review the new protocol
to determine our best strategy for moving forward." (19 words) See the following Table for more examples.




                                                                  6

 to              in order to, for the purpose of, so as to, with a view toward
 use             utilize, utilization of

2.5. Repeated Words

        2.5.1. Often, unnecessarily repeated words are a signal of poor structure. They also bury your message as shown here:
"The policy must be strictly enforced. To ensure the policy is enforced, all Principals shall..." (15 words).

          2.5.2. Cut the repeated words by restructuring your sentence, paragraph, and even a document when necessary, as well
as getting rid of passives that add to the problem. This allows you to highlight the important information, like this: "To ensure
they strictly enforce the policy, all Principals shall..." (10 words).

2.6. Repeated Meaning

          2.6.1. You may have more difficulty spotting the second redundancy problem - repeated meaning - where you write
the same message using different words: "Thank you for your efforts and energy on behalf of the members of the Air Force.
We appreciate the dedication you have shown in representing their interests... We look forward to meeting with you on other
issues of concern to the dedicated men..." (48 words).

         2.6.2. By cutting the repeated meaning and other wordiness, your message transmits much more sincerely and
succinctly. Keep this rule of thumb in mind: "It's not how many times you say it, it's how well you say it." Here's the revision:
"We appreciate and thank you for the dedication and efforts you've shown on behalf of the men and women who serve our
country. We look forward to meeting with you on additional concerns of interest to you..." (37 words).

2.7. Repeated Combinations. Do not use redundancies that repeat rather than reinforce meaning. See Table 2.2. for examples.

2.8. Reader Focus. Focus on what the reader needs to know by emphasizing what he or she gets from your message rather
than what you plan to give or do, according to the following guidelines:

                 2.8.1. Do not obscure the most important information - what the reader needs to do - as shown here: "The new
policy is intended to enhance screening processes for...."

                  2.8.2. Instead, let the reader know what he or she needs to do with the information upfront by stating the
purpose, like this: "The Assistant Vice of Staff recommends the new policy to enhance screening for...."


2.9. Speak directly to the reader, where appropriate.

         2.9.1. Avoid speaking in the abstract third person, which may alienate your reader or obscure the point you are trying
to make: "The actions taken were most helpful to our objectives."

          2.9.2. Connect directly to your audience, instead, by using the word, "you," or understood second person when giving
instructions, to highlight your point. In the revision, for example, let the reader know whose actions were helpful with the word
"your," as in "Your actions helped us meet our objectives."

2.10. Tone. Avoid an overly formal or pompous tone by using professional, natural language that engages your reader. See
Table 2.3.

2.11. Structure. Use a clear structure stating the purpose first with each supporting point following logically by using
transitions to keep the information flowing smoothly from point to point. See Table 2.4..

2.12. Using a lead-in to points that follow in a list or bullets. Keep bullet points parallel by leading each one off with the
same type of word (e.g., a verb or a noun), and lead off with verbs in the same tense and voice. See Figure C4.F1.

         MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION C

         FROM: HAF/ES

         SUBJECT: Instructions for Paragraphing the Official Memorandum

            This example shows the arrangement of paragraphs for the official
         memorandum.

               Paragraphs are typed in indented style; i.e., indented ½ inch from the left
         margin. They are single-spaced, with double spaces between them. Do not
         justify the right margin.

                   a. When a paragraph is subdivided it must have at least two
         subdivisions. If there is a subparagraph “a”, there must be a subparagraph “b”.
         The subparagraph is indented an additional ½ inch.

                            (1) When paragraphs are subdivided, lettered, and numbered,
         they are designated as follows: a., (1), (a), 1., a., (1), and (a).

                              (2) Each successive subdivision of a paragraph is indented an
         additional ½ inch.

                            (3) The second and subsequent lines of paragraphs and all
         subdivisions, except long quoted passages, extend from the left to the right
         margin.

                   b. Do not divide paragraph of less than four lines between two
         pages or place signature element on page by itself.

              This arrangement may be varied to meet special requirements, such as
         those from legal documents.

                       DISTRIBUTION C

        SUBJECT: Dual Signature Memorandum

              The dual signature memorandum is 12-point, MicrosoftTimes New Roman with the right margin
        unjustified. No FROM line is used with a dual signature memo.

               Use ―Secretary of the Air Force/Chief of Staff‖ preprinted flag letterhead for memorandums
         requiring dual signature of the Secretary of the Air Force and Chief of Staff. Memorandums requiring
         dual signatures of an Air Force official and DoD, or any other agency, use plain bond. If you are
         preparing for other 2-digit signatures (Secretariat or Air Staff) you can use preprinted or computer-
        generated letterhead (HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES AIR FORCE). The date is normally left
         blank and will be filled in after signature.

              The signature elements are five returns below the last line of the text, in upper and lower case,
        with the Secretary to the left and Chief of Staff to the right. Begin the attachment or enclosures listing
        three returns below the last line of the signature element.

               If preparing personalized memo, use salutation but omit complimentary close.

       MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS

       SUBJECT: Preparing Correspondence for Dual or Tri-Service Signature - Official
                Memorandum

       typing the sender’s address element at least seven lines from the top of the page. Begin the
       ―MEMORANDUM FOR‖ caption at least five lines from the last line of the address
       element.

Figure 4.7. General Guidelines from DOD 5110.4-M for OSD Action and Info Memos.

   Format
     Submit on letterhead.
     Limit to 1 page, unless issue is complex and requires greater explanation.
     Use short, concise and clear bullet statements (black dot bullet preferred).
     Font: MicrosoftTimes New Roman, 12 point.
     Page Setup: 1-inch margins, top and bottom, right and left.
     Double space between headings.
     Use 1.5 spaces between bullets.
     Number pages bottom center.
     Do not staple or use clam clips to assemble.

   Address memos to either the Secretary or Deputy Secretary; do not route through the Deputy to the Secretary.

   If an ACTION MEMO is addressed to the Secretary, the Executive Secretary will determine whether it will be provided to
    the Deputy Secretary by initialing the appropriate block on the memo (see sample and notes).

   A copy of an INFO MEMO addressed to the Secretary will be furnished to the Deputy Secretary by Communications and
    Directives (C&D).

   Provide the essential elements of information in bullet statements.

   Be brief and to the point, but not overly cryptic, in conveying what the Secretary or Deputy is being asked to do or know.
    If action is required, explain why it is okay for him to take that action.

   An acronym may be used after it is spelled out.

   Prepare memos as follows:
     ACTION or INFO MEMO will be the cover/forwarding document.
     TAB A: for an ACTION MEMO, the action item (e.g. item for signature or approval). If a similar letter is going to
        multiple addressees, then all letters can go at TAB A. If there are different items for signature or approval, then they
        will be separated at TAB A-1, A-2, etc.
     TAB B: incoming correspondence (if applicable).
     TAB C: any background material (if more than one tab needed, tab accordingly).
     TAB D (or last tab in package): list of coordinating offices/activities (see coordination section below).

   If substantive or lengthy background information is forwarded, provide a one page executive summary of the information
    at the background tab.

   If the document is classified, annotate the appropriate security classification markings, with classification/declassification
    instructions, at the top and bottom of the document.

   Coordination
     All coordination will be provided and listed on one page and should be located at the last tab.
     Include name, organization, position and date coordinated. Concurrences must be obtained from the Head of the OSD
       Component involved, or, in their absence, the Principal Deputy.
     List ―non-concurs‖, and include non-concurrence comments as part of the coordination tab.
     If coordination was attempted but not accomplished, then it should be stated on the coordination sheet; provide the
       amount of time allotted.
     If the memo does not require coordination, state ―NONE‖ on the memo.
     Do not provide documentation with the actual signatures of each coordinating official - it is the responsibility of the
       originating office to maintain documentation as part of the file for the action. The originating office will retain and
       dispose of the file in accordance with applicable records management disposition instructions.




                                                                 34
Figure 4.7. General Guidelines for OSD Action and Info Memos (Continued).

     For ACTION MEMOs:
         Provide an original plus one complete copy (copy held in C&D until decision by the Secretary or Deputy
            Secretary).
         If items are to be mailed after approval, provide the appropriate number of copies of enclosures as well as the
            mailing envelopes (if unclassified) or address labels (if classified).
         If the action includes a message and letter (usually applicable when item is going to an official of a foreign
            government), provide a hard copy and Decision Agent message on disk and a disk with the letter.
         Once action is completed and returned to C&D for disposition, C&D will provide a copy of the completed action
            to the originating office and all coordinating offices/activities. Disks will be returned to the originating office
            once the letter and message are approved and dispatched.

       For INFO MEMOs: provide an original plus two complete copies (one copy filed in C&D and the other copy either
        furnished to the Deputy (if addressed to the Secretary) or to the Executive Secretary (if addressed to the Deputy
        Secretary).

                   Administrators,

                   Please note the format of the small personal memo which is normally
                   prepared on 5X8 paper. The style is MicrosoftTimes New Roman, 12
                   point, unjustified right margin with flush left margin. You may build a
                   heading and enter a slogan of your preference.

                   This personal memo is used informally to transmit information within
                   your organization as a ―handy‖ tool. This format is not intended to
                   replace the official memorandum.

         SUBJECT: Same as Brief Sheet (U)

              (U) The Chief of Staff Air Force Memorandum (CSAFM) is used by the Chief of
         Staff to present information or recommendations to the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff
         (CJCS) and to initiate an action for consideration by the JCS.

              (U) The CSAFM should be short (normally one or two paragraphs) and
         specifically state what the CSAF wants to address. Use of the first person is
         acceptable. (e.g., ―I believe,‖ ―I recommend,‖ or ―my staff stands ready to assist‖)

             (U) The CSAFM is prepared using MicrosoftTimes New Roman, 12 point font.
         You may remove the From line and Signature Block (only for the CSAFM
         memorandum) to simplify the process. The signature block is stamped or typed 5 lines
         below the last line of text.

5.1. Overview. The purpose of a staff summary sheet is to provide the background information needed by the decision maker
in a brief but concise format. AF IMT (Form) 1768, available on the E-publishing web site (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/),
may be used for hardcopy packages. Templates available on the portal at the HAF/ES portal page: AF Portal - HAF/ES -
Executive Secretariat.

SUBJECT: This is an Example of the email SSS (eSSS)

1. PURPOSE: To obtain SecAF approval of eSSS format at Tab 1.

2. BACKGROUND: The eSSS is a brief summary of your staff package and should be limited to one page.

3. DISCUSSION: Prepare body in numbered paragraph format using the same succinct, clear writing style
recommended for the traditional SSS.

4. VIEWS OF OTHERS: Use ―N/A‖ if no comments from others. Include views of others if there are differing
viewpoints so that the decision makers can have all the information they need to make the right decisions. To
keep the eSSS succinct, provide multiple views in a tab ―Comment Resolution Matrix (CRM),‖ to include
mitigation of comments.

5. RECOMMENDATION: SecAF approve the electronic staff summary sheet at Tab 1. If for information only,
use ―None. For Information Only‖.

Figure 5.2. The Staff Summary Sheet General Information.

General Information
     Use to request SecAF/Command Section coordination (COORD), approval (APPR), signature (SIG), or to forward
        information (INFO).
     Pull key facts and data into SSS; reference appropriate tabs for more detail.
     The format is similar to a traditional SSS when preparing the email SSS.
     Use white background only with the eSSS (pictures & graphics use too much bandwidth).
     Use Plain Text Format only. Verify this before you start typing.
     Keep to one page.
     Use 12-point, MicrosoftTimes New Roman font.
     Use correction tape or pen-and-ink for minor changes for paper packages.
     Include appropriate security classification markings. (See AFI 31-401.)
     Strict adherence to file naming conventions is important. Electronic files should be named, "Tab 1- File name", "Tab
        2-File name". Action documents are placed at Tab 1. Use this naming convention when saving your files. However,
        do not use this format when listing your attachments on the eSSS. Use standard attachment format.
     If you have a large package (binders), print out attachments, coordination data and add eSSS as a cover sheet and
        process as a hard copy.
     Monitor progress.
     Meet HAF/ES task due date. Request extension as soon as possible, if needed.
     Submit SSS with Tabs electronically to HAF/ES.
     If SSS returned for rewrite, re-coordinate if necessary. Submit new SSS; place rejected SSS behind new SSS.
     If re-coordination is not necessary, respond with official memorandum or SSS.
     Return SSS packages within 24 hours when returned for format or typographical corrections.
Section A. "Topline"
     Immediately create a break below the routing section when preparing the eSSS. A break is a short line of dashes
        followed by the heading of the material to follow (e.g., STAFF SUMMARY).
     Include only 2-letter COORD/APPR/SIG addressees; (2/3/4-letters okay for signing SSS only). COORD: When
        sending behind the glass doors (SAF/OS, US, AF/CC, CV or CVA) move the 2-digit coord to the end of the email and
        put glass door coord lines at the top of the email when using the eSSS.
     Directorate executive officers are responsible for removing/deleting everything below 2-ltr routing prior to sending to
        originating office or up to HAF/ES. The individual who coordinated will enter their name, rank, date. For example:
        SAF/IE Coord Walker, Col, 6 Jun 09,(See attached comments)
     SAF/US/OS and AF/CC are the only INFO addressees permitted in topline when processing between glass doors.
        HAF/ES process between the glass doors.
     DO NOT put ―copy provided‖ for SAF/OS/US, AF/CC/CV/CVA, or HAF/CX unless entire package is for info only.
     ―Copy provided‖ is not authorized for coord not received from 2-ltrs. Instead use ―Coord Not Received‖ after 2-ltr
        fails to obtain coord through contact with appropriate 2-ltr.
     List courtesy copy addressees under "cc:". (AO provides copy)
     Get OPR's topline action first, then all other topline action (or OPR two-letter signs SSS).
     Complete all topline action prior to glass door action (SAF/OS/US, AF/CC/CV/CVA).
     If OSD action, include SAF/OS. If SAF/OS action, include SAF/US.
     If SAF/OS action to Air Staff, include AF/CC.
     Show AF/CC action in topline, as well as AF/CV and AF/CVA coord. Use recommendation line to show intended
        final action.
     If topline action addressee do NOT concur on an action, the person non-concurring should insert comments
     Comments to the SSS may be added in the routing or attached in a comment resolution matrix (CRM) or a file w/track
        changes. Send comments to OPR.
     If differences resolved w/o change, no rewrite (SSS/tabs) required. Insert comment ―Difference resolved--no change
        in SSS necessary." Withdraw non-concurrence.
     If differences resolved but SSS needs rewrite, OPR prepares new SSS and reroutes.
     If differences CANNOT be resolved, OPR 2-letter signs rebuttal memo explaining why proposed action cannot be
        changed. Attach as last tab to SSS; send to next official.

                                                           Section B.
     Type name, grade, abbreviated organizational code/functional address symbol (FAS), typist’s initials.
     Type subject (preferably unclassified) and date when signed. The subject line should be the HAF/ES subject or a
        subject generated by the owning agency. When coordinating w/in your own 2-digit you may add or delete words, but
        when responding to the originating office the title should reflect the original title.
        SSSs should have a suspense date. If the tasker has a suspense date, use that date. If the pkg was not generated from
        a tasker but a suspense must be met for an ―event‖ to occur, assign an appropriate suspense date. Except in rare cases
        with a hard suspense, suspense dates SHOULD be more than 24 hrs out from the date of the SSS. If you have a hard
        suspense where there will be specific impact if the package is not approved then it needs to be stated in the ―Purpose‖
        of the SSS. SSS date should be the date the SSS is signed.
                                                           Section C.
     Type body of SSS in narrative style.
     Mandatory headings are: PURPOSE, DISCUSSION, VIEWS OF OTHERS and RECOMMENDATION.
     In VIEWS OF OTHERS, explain whether external agencies disagreements/concern were resolved. If no
        disagreements or concerns, use ―N/A.‖ To keep the SSS succinct, provide multiple views in a tab ―Comment
        Resolution Matrix (CRM)‖ to include mitigation of comments.
     When BACKGROUND is used, list significant information. Place before RECOMMENDATION heading.
        (RECOMMENDATION heading should be final heading used).
                                                           Section D.
     Type signature element 4 lines below last line of text.
     Include duty phone/DSN of signer.
     Signature is MANDATORY. (OPR determines who signs.)(Electronic packages use //signed// with track changes on).
        Signature and signature block must be the same.
     You may not sign “for.”
     Type tabs about 3 spaces to right of SSS center. (See below for arrangement of tabs.)
     Show 2-letter courtesy copy distribution as small ―cc:‖ 2 lines below last tab listed.

          6.1. Staffing:

                  6.1.1. The staffing process can begin at any level.

                   6.1.2. Many actions originate external to the HAF, such as, from the President, members of Congress, and the
Secretary of Defense. Correspondence directed to, or originated by, the Top 4 or AVCSAF is electronically tasked by HAF/ES
to the appropriate OPR/OCR(s). The staffing process usually involves a series of three main parts: tasking, response
development/coordination, and final action.

                    6.1.3. Staffing tools defined for use within HAF for tasking, coordinating and staffing, that are included with
the standardized desktop configuration (SDC) will be used. Standard and descriptive naming conventions are required to
facilitate effective communication and electronic mail management within the HAF.

                  6.1.4. Manage documents IAW records management procedures outlined in HOI 33-17, AFI 33-322, and AFI
33-364.

                  6.1.5. HAF/ES is the primary distributor of tasks for the Top 4 and AVCSAF. The following task actions are
most common:

                      6.1.5.1. Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) or Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF) Action.
Actions requiring preparation of correspondence for SECDEF or DEPSECDEF signature are tasked to SecAF from OSD
(CCD), and require SecAF approval before delivery to OSD (CCD) in room 3C843. Each staff package is processed through
HAF/ES after coordination through designated OSD action offices and must contain a SECDEF/DEPSECDEF Action Memo
for SecAF signature (see instructions at Figure 4.7 and example at Figure 4.8). Request for extension or transfer to another
OSD organization outside the Air Force must be accomplished via SD Form 391 with justification. SD Form 391 will be
submitted to HAF/ES for approval, signature, and forwarding to OSD (CCD).

                       6.1.5.2. SECDEF or DEPSECDEF Information. Correspondence for SECDEF or DEPSECDEF
information is tasked to SecAF from OSD (CCD) and requires SecAF approval before delivery to CCD, room 3C843. Each
staff package is processed through HAF/ES and must contain a SECDEF/DEPSECDEF Information Memo for SecAF signature
(see example at Figure 4.9). Request for extension or transfer to another OSD agency outside the Air Force must be
accomplished via SD Form 391 with justification. SD Form 391 will be submitted to HAF/ES for approval, signature, and
forwarding to OSD (CCD).

                       6.1.5.3. Other OSD Agency Actions. Unless otherwise directed, HAF OPRs will respond directly to
the OSD action office/POC. Requests for due date extension or external-AF transfer by the OPR must be negotiated with and
approved by the OSD POC. It is the OPR’s responsibility to notify HAF/ES of approved requests. Additionally, it is the OPR’s
responsibility to determine if Top 4 involvement is required, whether for action or information.

                       6.1.5.4 Top 4 Action. These actions require preparation of correspondence for Top 4 or AVCSAF
signature, approval, or information, and can be self-generated or in response to a tasking. Unless otherwise directed, responses
for these actions must be forwarded to HAF/ES for further processing.

                       6.1.5.5. Direct Reply. A task that the OPR responds directly to the writer without approval or signature
of OSD, Top 4, or AVCSAF. The OPR determines the level of response within their organization. A good rule of thumb to
follow is the signature should be of equal rank or level as the writer of the incoming correspondence. When the action has been
tasked by HAF/ES, an electronic copy of the reply (document repository #) should be provided to HAF/ES for task closure.
The OPR is responsible for ensuring retention of a copy of all direct reply responses. Additionally, should the OPR determine
Top 4 or AVCSAF response is more appropriate, process accordingly through HAF/ES. Direct Reply responses on behalf of
The President, SECDEF, DEPSECDEF, or Top 4 should begin with a reference to the constituent’s correspondence and who
the response is ―on behalf of.‖




                                                                 47
                   6.1.6. Task Control Numbers. A unique identifying number assigned to each task created using
task/tracking tool. For tracking purposes, OPRs will ensure staff packages and task-related correspondence (i.e. email) make
reference to task control numbers.

                  6.1.7. Task Categories. For Top 4 and AVCSAF actions, HAF/ES groups tasks into the following
categories:

                      6.1.7.1. OSD (CCD) Tracked. These actions are tasked to the SecAF by OSD (CCD) on behalf of
SECDEF or DEPSECDEF. Task control numbers are assigned by OSD (CCD) and begin with ―OSD‖. The OSD control
number will be used throughout the life of the task.

                        6.1.7.2. OSD Task. These actions are tasks generated in response to an action received from other OSD
action offices, not tasked by OSD (CCD).

                   6.1.7.3. SAF/OS, SAF/US, AF/CC, AF/CV, or AF/CVA Task. Actions tasked by HAF/ES on behalf
of SecAF, USecAF, CSAF, VCSAF or AVCSAF.

                     6.1.7.4. Congressional Task. Actions tasked by HAF/ES on behalf of SecAF, CSAF, or VCSAF in
response to Congressional correspondence.

Actions tasked by the Top 4 and              NLT 15 workdays (task dependent)           HAF/ES
AVCSAF
Notes: 1. Suspense deadlines are due by 1600L on the due date. Due dates are when the task must be completed. HAF/ES
will factor in a 7 - 10 workday period to cover Top 4 and AVCSAF action on all tasks. 2. Principals provide direct email
response to AF/CC with cc: to AF/CV and AF/CVA NLT COB each Wednesday. If unable to provide a complete response to
AF/CC queries, Directors will still reply via email by the initial suspense to provide interim information and to establish timing
for a completed response. Once a response has been provided to AF/CC, HAF/ES will close the task although there may be
follow-up actions. The thought is that Senior leaders have established dialog and will continue responding to AF/CC until
completed.

                                                                48
                  6.1.8. Task Acceptance and Rejection (Transfer). OPRs/AOs determine if tasks should be accepted or
rejected on behalf of their agency and will notify the tasking agent accordingly. The 2-ltr principal may reject any tasking
provided a request is justified and submitted to HAF/ES. The Director of Staff is the final arbitrator if a rejection of a tasking
cannot be resolved. If the task is accepted, the task should be forwarded to the AO in a timely manner. The OPR of the task is
responsible for adding or clarifying task instructions and guidance before assignment. Requests should be submitted in a timely
manner. Naming conventions at Attachment 2 should be used.

                   6..1.9. Timeliness of Rejections and Transfer Requests. To appeal an action assignment, an Executive
Officer or Military Assistant shall contact HAF/ES within 1 duty day for task with due dates of 2 weeks or less; within 2 duty
days for task with due dates of 2 weeks or more. If returned within the prescribed time-limits with reasonable rationale for
reassignment, HAF/ES shall accept the action for transfer without further coordination. The initial action office is responsible
for coordinating all action assignment transfers after the initial 24-hour period. When seeking transfer, ensure the accepting
official has the authority to accept and the capability to complete the action. Annotate in transfer request the name, office, and
telephone number of the accepting official and return it with the original document to HAF/ES. HAF/ES shall then forward to
the new responsible office with a revised suspense, as appropriate. Tasks with a HIGH priority require transfer request upon
receipt. If known, include a recommended OPR in the justification.

                    6.1.10. Due Date Extension Requests. Proactive requests to adjust established due dates should be done
early and elevated by the AO to the OPR for assessment and further processing. Requests received after the due date has
expired will be forwarded to the Director of Staff if approval cannot be made by HAF/ES. HAF/ES will indicate in the task
instructions if an external AF agency is the final approval authority and if processing to their POC is appropriate. For OSD
(CCD) tasked items, these actions MUST be fully justified and processed through the OPR chain to HAF/ES for processing. An
extension request must be accompanied by an electronic copy of an interim response or justification must be provided
explaining why an interim response is not warranted. Interim responses are required via email (in Bottom Line Up Front
(BLUF) format) for all CSAF Weekend taskers that do not have complete information by the suspense date.

                  6.1.11. HOT Packages. A HOT package requires the senior leader to drop whatever they are doing to
review your package because the issue will affect the immediate safety and security of personnel. It may also be something
needed for ongoing contingencies or war efforts, or the SECDEF, DEPSECDEF, SecAF or CSAF has asked for an immediate
response on a task. Justification for the HOT package should be provided in the purpose of the eSSS explaining why you need
to have the package completed by a specific date. In contrast, if one is late meeting a task due date, that does not mean the
package is HOT.

         6.2. Coordination Process:

                  6.2.1. When we as Airmen develop a consistent, coherent, and coordinated position, we speak with one voice
and we are best able to articulate our Service preferences. Complete HAF coordination gives affected organizations an
opportunity to contribute to and comment on actions. Early involvement of all concerned organizations is crucial to full
development of an issue. A properly coordinated action considers the full range of options on the issue and presents all relevant
facts. The extent of coordination depends on the nature of the action. The AO assigned as the OPR for a staff package is
responsible to see the package through completion. Completion is defined as proper dissemination of completed and
coordinated information to all applicable as affected by the content of the package therein.

                          6.2.1.1 Preliminary Coordination. At this stage, AO-level input is sought to identify issues and
strengthen the action.

                          6.2.1.2. Final Coordination. At this stage of coordination, concurrence or nonconcurrence is
requested from at least the two-digit unless delegated to a lower level.

                         6.2.1.3 Coordination Responses. Coordination responses are accomplished in three ways: (1) concur,
(2) nonconcur, or (3) concur and submit suggested changes or comments that do not form the basis for a nonconcurrence.
Nonconcurrences must be accompanied by specific recommended changes and supporting rationale, if appropriate. Suggested
changes may also be provided with a nonconcurrence; however, they must be clearly distinguished from issues on which a
nonconcurrence is based. An attempt must be made to resolve all nonconcurrences before moving forward for final
approval/signature. If not resolved, briefly state the reason why issue could not be resolved in the body of the eSSS.


                                                                 49
                                 6.2.1.3.1. Critical Comments. Comments that reflect changes which must be made to the
staff package before moving forward. Critical comments not incorporated should be identified before the staff package moves
forward. Comments should be attached using a CRM to include mitigation of comments.

                                   6.2.1.3.2. Non-Critical Comments. Proposed changes to the staff package that should be
considered before staff package is submitted for final action.

                                     6.2.1.3.3. Administrative Comments. Comments that propose changes to the format of the
staff package and not the content.

                          6.2.1.4. Re-accomplishment of Coordination. If substantive changes are made to the staff package,
coordination must be re-accomplished. Normally, any change necessary to accommodate the nonconcurring view of one
organization will be substantive and require coordination with all concerned.

                           6.2.1.5. Networking. Coordination is also accomplished through the system of networking. AOs
generally inherit points of contact (POCs) from their predecessor. A personally built network provides great results.

              6.2.2. All correspondence staffed to SecAF or CSAF requires two-letter coordination by designated
OPRs/OCRs unless directed otherwise by HAF/ES.

                  6.2.3. To obtain three letter and below coordination on packages tasked by HAF/ES:

                        6.2.3.1. The AO is responsible for obtaining proper coordination prior to sending to the 2-digit. Any
packages coming into the 2-digit for coordination should have been properly staffed and coordinated at the lower levels.

                         6.2.3.2. If required, once four and three letter coordination is completed, the package is returned to
the AO to consolidate and forward package for two-letter coordination.

                         6.2.3.3. If required, three-letter coordination can be reflected at the bottom of the staff summary sheet
or as a separate attachment to the package.

                  6.2.4. A staff package held up in the coordination process robs the action office of suspense time and deducts
from the time senior leadership has to review a package and make critical decisions. To preclude the staff package from being
held up during the coordination process, each level (e.g. 4-digit, 3-digit, 2-digit, etc.) will have 48 hours to complete
coordination. A non-response will signify a concurrence. When a problem arises, OPRs and AOs should work with the
appropriate 2-digit executive officer to solve the delay. If an appropriate resolution cannot be made at the lowest level, OPRs
and AOs may forward staff packages on to the next coordinating office and the AO will place ―Coordination Not Received‖ in
the appropriate coordination block with the allotted amount of time. HAF/ES may also be contacted anytime during the
coordination process to facilitate the moving of a staff package.

         6.3. Package Routing:

                  6.3.1. Packages enroute to the Top 4 or AVCSAF must be staffed through HAF/ES.

                  6.3.2. All extraneous material should be removed from the package prior to staffing to HAF/ES.

                  6.3.3. All packages need to be labeled IAW the HAF naming convention. (See Attachment 2)

                  6.3.4. Plan 7-10 days for staffing a package from HAF/ES to the Top 4 and AVCSAF and back to HAF/ES.

                  6.3.5. OSD tasks often require OSD coordination. OSD guidance is that coordination should take no more
than 48 hours to complete. When obtaining coordination, give the coordinating office a 48-hour suspense. If you have to move
your package forward without OSD coordination, you must annotate why you are forwarding without the coordination.

                          6.3.5.1. Send packages to several offices simultaneously if more than one OSD office needs to
                  coordinate.

                           6.3.5.2. Contact HAF/ES if coordination is not accomplished by your suspense date. HAF/ES will
work with military assistants from SAF/OS and the appropriate military assistant from OSD to facilitate moving of your
package.
                                                                50
                 6.3.6. All packages for actions to Air Force Policy Directives, AF Supplements to DoDDs, AF Policy
Memoranda, or HAF Mission Directives must be routed to SAF/AA for final review/coordination after all other coordination
has been obtained (to include AF/CC) prior to SECAF signature.‖

         6.4. Congressional Correspondence. SAF/LL and SAF/FMBL manage the Congressional correspondence process
and assign associated tasks on behalf of the Top 4. When tasked, Secretariat and Air Staff offices will prepare responses in
final format to include fully coordinated staff summary sheet to the 2-digit level, ready for Top 4 coordination, as appropriate.
Use this HOI and HOI 33-10 when preparing your correspondence. SAF/LL and SAF/FMBL will process packages through
HAF/ES to obtain Top 4 signature/approval. Once signed, SAF/LL and SAF/FMBL will deliver Congressional correspondence
to appropriate Congressional staff offices.

         6.5. Written Communications. Specific instructions for preparing and using written communications in the
Secretariat and Air Staff are covered in Chapter 1-4. Suggested templates for talking, point, background, and position papers
are found in AFH 33-337. For other correspondence formats, see AFMAN 33-326, DoD 5110.4-M and AFH 33-337.

         6.6. Authentication and Signature. Electronic signature is authentication. Prepare correspondence for signature at
the lowest appropriate level within the Air Staff and Secretariat. Communications with higher offices or agencies (SAF/OS,
SECDEF, or DEPSECDEF) must be processed through the Top 4 and AVCSAF for coordination (this includes the Secretariat
when tasked). The following types of communication require signature, approval, or coordination by Top 4 or AVCSAF.

               6.6.1. Legal matters having policy impacts.

               6.6.2. Changes in policy or position having Air Force-wide impacts.

               6.6.3. Signature or approval of the SECDEF or DEPSECDEF (requires SecAF signature).

               6.6.4. Replies to officials of higher or comparable levels outside the Department of the Air Force.

               6.6.5. Replies to requests of senior commanders or comparable officials within the Air Force.

               6.6.6. Communications involving major issue differences between two-letter/digit officials.

         6.7. Adopted Forms.

              6.7.1. AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet

                                              NAMING CONVENTIONS

Naming conventions for Electronic Communications: The following table depicts mandatory naming conventions for
electronic communications and related email traffic in the HAF. Naming conventions were established to help everyone
manage email traffic, and it is critical to use them when staffing your electronic package or sending task. In HAF/ES, as well as
the Top 4 offices, email with the word ―Package‖, ―Pkg‖, and ―Task‖ are directed to subfolders so that electronic
communications can be easily differentiated from regular email traffic. Packages or tasks not labeled correctly could linger
unnecessarily in someone’s organizational inbox. Further, if you do not name your package correctly using the naming
conventions, it may not get associated with the correct task if it relates to a task. AOs must always remember to title electronic
packages using the appropriate naming conventions.

                                       Task Management Tool (TMT) Business Rules:

A11.1 Task Management Tool has been designated as the official tasking/tracking tool for all task/staff packages within the
HAF, and the integrated SharePoint system has been designated as the document repository for this tool. However, records
managers are reminded that SharePoint is not a certified System of Record. Unit records management shared drives have been
designated as official records storage.

        A11.1.1. Training is key to being successful using TMT. TMT training is mandatory for newcomers to the HAF.
Newly arrived AOs are exempt only if their supervisor determines the AO’s expected duties will not require any
correspondence staffing processes or if the AO has been assigned to the HAF staff and used TMT in their previous assignment.
All users must complete the CBT available via the HAF/ESL Learning Management System (LMS) https://ncr-
lms.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp. Additionally, users should sign-up in LMS for HAF/ES’s hands-on training class.

       A11.1.2. Other training is also available within TMT http://wtm.afncr.af.mil/HAF/loader.aspx such as ―How 2s‖ and
―Getting Started with TMT.‖

 A11.2. Everyone across the HAF (Secretariat/Air Staff offices) must recognize the core references used in establishing
 processes and products. References include: DoD 5110.4-M, AFMAN 33-326, HOI 33-3, and AFH 33-337. HOI 33-3
 provides guidance that is unique to the HAF so when there is conflicting guidance, it takes precedence. Access to all these
 references is available via the HAF/ES Portal site or via the Templates within Task Management Tool (TMT).

        A11.2.1. The goal is to ensure timeliness and quality of correspondence requiring Glass Door (SecAF, USecAF, CSAF,
VCSAF (Top 4), AVCSAF) signature, approval, and providing task responses. This same goal applies in completing actions
for your prinicipals. A predictable, repeatable and accountable process ensures timeliness and quality to provide minimal
confusion to Action Officers and executive support staff.

       A11.2.2. The staffing process applies across the headquarters. We must document all leadership policy and decision
items within a proper records/filing system.

A11.3. General Rules

         A11.3.1. Priorities and Suspense Dates

                  A11.3.1.1. Priorities and suspense dates are separate and independent but hierarchical elements of every task.
Established suspense dates take precedence in this relationship. When two suspense dates coincide, then priorities will be used
to establish which task will take precedence in efforts to complete/close. Standard HAF suspense timelines are located in Table
6-1, pg 49.

                  A11.3.1.2. Tasking priorities are used subordinate to suspense deadlines. When multiple tasks are due
simultaneously, the Tasker Priority is used to focus attention and resources to higher priority deliverables passing between
HAF/ES, directorate executive support staffs and action officers. Priority definitions are as follows:

                              A11.3.1.2.1. HOT: Only used on newly emerging Top 4 task (or higher leadership) requiring
immediate attention for timely response. Default suspense for a HOT task is 48 hrs on weekdays or 2 workdays when crossing
weekends.

                               A11.3.1.2.2. Priority 1: Assigned to all actions requiring SAF/OS and AF/CC for Sign/Appr as
well as all actions (Sign, Appr, or Info) to higher levels of DoD or civilian leadership.

                            A11.3.1.2.3. Priority 2: Assigned to all actions to SAF/OS and AF/CC for Info and all
Sign/Appr items for SAF/US, AF/CV and CVA. Also available at directorate level for internal task.

                                A11.3.1.2.4. Priority 3: Assigned to all actions tasked as Reply Direct from Secretariat and Air
Staff organizations and for all AF/CV and CVA Info items. Also available at directorate level for internal task.



                                                                63
Attachment 11, TMT Business Rules (Continued).

                               A11.3.1.2.5. Priority 4: Not assigned, available for internal task.

                               A11.3.1.2.6. Priority 5: Not assigned, available for internal task.

A11.4. Creating a task

          A11.4.1. The staffing process can begin at any level, however, HAF/ES is the tasking authority for the Top 4
leadership plus AF/CVA. Congressional tasks will be assigned to SAF/LL as OPR who in turn will task the appropriate subject
matter expert (SME) as OCR.

          A11.4.2. Before creating any task, a search of TMT should be conducted to ensure no other task has been created that
can be used to accomplish your task. If a match is found, contact the initiator/owning org to see if you may join in on the task.
A HAF/ES task created on behalf of the Top 4 or AVCSAF takes precedence over any duplicate task unless agreement is
reached between the Director of Staff.

           A11.4.3. Also, HAF organizations may receive a task directly from an outside agency, e.g., OSD-P. In these
situations the owning OPRs will develop the task and dispatch it directly to HAF/ES using the Pre-route function of TMT.
This allows for proper visibility to manage and ensure timely responses and gives HAF/ES ownership.

                    A11.4.3.1. Pre-route will include to whom the correspondence is addressed, a short subject and identify
from whom the correspondence is from along with the date of the correspondence, e.g., OS-F-35 Basing at Nellis AFB,
Member of Congress (MOC) Jones 10 May 10.

                        A11.4.3.2. The HAF pre-routing organization is also responsible for completing the following fields; My
Instructions, Priority, Category, Action and selecting the appropriate OPR under ―Manage Assignment‖.

                       A11.4.3.3. My Instructions section will include a brief task summary and label as such, i.e., TASK
SUMMARY. Also, include the deliverables, i.e., Prepare eSSS fully coordinated with memo for SecAF signature. OCR
information is also included in this area, i.e., OCR: SAF/IE, AF/A3/5.

                           TASK SUMMARY:
                           Deliverable:
                           OCR:

                       A11.4.3.4. See TMT instructions within TMT for completing the Pre-route.

        A11.4.4. Tasks resulting from leadership queries or guidance during formal or table-top briefings will be added to the
TMT system by the OPR of the briefing using the Pre-route function of TMT.

         A11.4.5. The HAF TMT will NOT be used to task outside agencies such as MAJCOMS. Email or Outlook Task
Manager can be used to task these agencies.

A11.5. Tasker Classification (TMT)

          A11.5.1. UNCLASSIFIED – Used for all taskers not constrained by the four descriptions below.

          A11.5.2. UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO – At a minimum this should be used for any products and responses that contain
pre-decisional, policy draft or other sensitive information that has not received final approval or directive from leadership. It
can also be used at the discretion of the originating (or owning) office for items deemed deserving of FOUO status by
leadership within their organization. Once selected the task becomes private and only visible to those involved in the task.

           A11.5.3. UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO//PRIVACY ACT INFORMATION – To be used in all situations when individually
indentifying info is held as part of the tasker text or within the originating documents. Examples include anything containing
SSANs, phone numbers, personal addresses, birth dates, medical info, etc. Once selected the task becomes private and only
visible to those involved in the task.



                                                                 64
Attachment 11, TMT Business Rules (Continued).

 Once selected the task becomes private and only visible to those involved in the task.

A11.6. Action. This field identifies required actions to complete the task. Additional information on the recipient (SecAF,
CSAF, etc.) can be found in the My Instructions portion of the tasker data. The recipient should also be identified in the subject
with office abbreviations at the beginning of the subject, i.e. OS-Using TMT.

A11.7. Acceptance, rejection, OPR/OCR changes. OPRs/Action Officers are considered subject matter experts and will
therefore be responsible for accepting or rejecting new taskers as well as providing additional inputs regarding proper OCRs. If
the OPR determines they are not the proper OPR for a task they will pass notification to HAF/ES or tasking agency via their 2-
Ltr Executive Officer or Military Assistant. Timing limitations and responsibilities for these changes are included in para 6.1.8.
of this HOI.

A11.8. OCR Instructions. Adding OCRs and specific OCR instructions into the TMT task will be the responsibility of the
OPR by clicking on the Manage Assignments button.

A11.9. Response requirements. Action officers will provide complete staff packages IAW this HOI. For tasks involving
documents that require Top 4 review/signature, an eSSS must be included in My Response to provide proper staff coordination
prior to leadership review. Use the Start Final Coord button in TMT and then select the subsequent Forward button to route the
staff action for final coordination. Normally tasks/packages should be forwarded to HAF/ES via 2-Ltr OPRs or their designated
agents.

A11.10. Use of templates. All directorates will use HAF-approved templates to produce all staff packages requiring HAF
action. Templates for all products are available electronically in two locations: (1) within the SharePoint structure of TMT via
Templates button and (2) via the HAF/ES Portal website.

A11.11. CSAF Weekend Tasker. CSAF weekend tasker email responses will use BLUF format. BLUF format includes the
following three items: (1) Restate the CC/CV/CVA question, (2) Provide a BLUF answer to provide bottom line answer to the
question and (3) Additional info or details to add background issues, considerations, limitations or factors that led to the BLUF
response.

A11.12. Coordination Process.

        A11.12.1. See para 6.2, of this HOI. TMT Note: Staff Packages for Glass Door action should only have final 2-ltr
coordination. Lower level coordination should remain with Action Officers for records issues.

          A11.12.2. Staff packages created by directorates and not associated with a task from HAF/ES will be routed to
HAF/ES using the Start Final Coord option. Refer to this HOI for proper routing/setup and TMT instructions for using this
function.

          A11.12.3. OPRs accomplish coordination outside the glass doors by using the Manage Assignment function and
assigning OCRs. If using the shot gun method, assign an OPR along with the OCRs to make the process within TMT smoother.
You should use your 2-ltr, 3-ltr, or 4-ltr managers within your directorate, which allows collection and assembly of responses
into staff package form.



                                                                 65
Attachment 11, TMT Business Rules (Continued).

       A11.12.4. Using this method does not allow OCRs to upload documents to the Tab section so OCRs will have to load
       any additional documents to public workspace.

       A11.12.5. If time is not an issue and you do not need to shot gun your package, the Start Final Coord option is best.

     A11.12.6. Again TMT will NOT be used to communicate with outside agencies, such as MAJCOMS and
NGB/CF. Email or Outlook Task Manager can be used to coordinate your actions.

A11.13. Document Space.

          A11.13.1. Original Docs library is used to save incoming task documents. If a staff package is being routed for Top 4
action, save a copy of the original document from this area to the appropriate tab within the ―Tab‖ section.

         A11.13.2. Tabs library is used to save Tabs for staff packages and provide signed responses to a task. Tabs should be
saved using naming rules from ―Establishing a Task‖, e.g., Tab 1 – Using TMT.

         A11.13.3. Public Workspace library is used for collaboration documents and all documents should be saved using
established naming rules from ―Establishing a Task‖ and identify your organization at the beginning of your subject, e.g., IG-
Comments on Using TMT, 17 May 10.

A11.14. Extension requests. See para 6.1.10 of this HOI. Extension requests will only be accepted via TMT.

A11.15. Interim responses.

        A11.15.1. Required via email (in BLUF format) for all CSAF Weekend taskers that do not have complete information
by suspense.

          A11.15. 2. Also required for all taskers responding to suspense dates directed from outside the HAF. In many cases
these interim responses will require a signed product but may be accomplished by other means—telephone contact or in person.
An example is an interim response to MOCs for a constituent request. Any interim response must be provided with extension
request. If by memo, provide sign copy in Tabs section. If by other means, provide under Notes/Audit tab.

A11.16. Closing taskers.

        A11.16.1. To officially close any Top 4 tasker, HAF/ES must receive a copy of the final action documents
reviewed/signed by Top 4. For email responses between Top 4 and 2-Ltrs, Execs should provide response copies in Tab section
which include leadership’s acknowledgement. Or, provide response under My Response tab. Follow-on questions will be
handled directly between 2-ltr principals and Top 4 unless HAF/ES is directed by Top 4 to continue suspense action.

         A11.16.2. Tasks that result in staff packages being forwarded for Top 4 action require the OPR to provide staff
packages in the proper format. Provide eSSS under My Response in proper format using the template provided in the Templates
area. Attachments are provided in the Tab section in proper sequence and properly labeled, i.e. Tab 1–Using Templates. The
OPR marks the task complete once all actions have been completed.

         A11.16.3. ―Reply Direct‖ responses are provided under Tabs and task marked as completed.

       A11.16.4. For any action started on the NIPR and responses are provided on the SIPR, note this response under the
My Response tab, i.e. Response sent on SIPR.

          A11.16.5. For formal or table-top briefings, 2-Ltr execs should provide HAF/ES information on final Top 4
program/policy decisions or COA selections. They should also provide HAF/ES notification on where such information is being
stored/filed within the 2-Ltrs records management system.




                                                               66
Attachment 11, TMT Business Rules (Continued).

A11.17. Records Management and File Responsibility. HAF/ES will properly file all official correspondence receiving Top
4 signature IAW AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, guidance. Directorates and action officers who are authorized to
bypass HAF/ES are required to properly document and file all similar Top 4 signed documents whenever the staffing process is
complete.




                                                             67
