SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This revision deletes all references to contract pilots and Naval Flight Officer training and
standardizes operations to support Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training (UCT).
Chapter 1 adds the recommended changes and waivers paragraph (paragraph 1.1); deletes the
exception to the Buddy Instructor Pilot (BIP) program for Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola
(paragraphs 1.1.3.2 and 4.6); creates a requirement for the 479 Flying Training Group (FTG) to
establish a Chief Pilot in lieu of a flight commander (paragraph 1.2.6); clarifies
experienced/inexperienced pilot designation minimum hours (paragraphs 1.2.3.1.1.1 and
1.2.3.1.1.2); and deletes AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training, and replaces
it with AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications (paragraph 1.4.2.1). Chapter 2 emphasizes
AFI 11-202, Volume 1, intent, ensuring individuals engaged in formal qualification training are
dedicated to that training (paragraphs 2.1.2 and 3.5); clarifies that first pilots (FP) must be
certified prior to commanding sorties (paragraph 2.1.3.1); and clarifies that instructor combat
systems officers (ICSO) may take an active part in combat systems officer (CSO) initial
qualification training (IQT) sorties (paragraph 2.4.1). Chapter 3 clarifies guidance for
establishing initial currency dates during requalification training (paragraph 3.10.2.1) and the
required course of training for requalifying civil service instructor pilots (CSIP) out of the
aircraft for 2 to 5 years (paragraph 3.10.3.1). Chapter 4 adds the air intercept (AI) mission
(throughout); requires IPs to be simulator-certified to administer simulator emergency
procedures (EP)/cockpit/crew resource management (CRM) missions and allows experienced IPs
to log EP/CRM simulator training with ICSOs (paragraph 4.4.1); adds landing and scenario
requirements for CSO EP/CRM training (paragraphs 4.4.2.9 and 4.4.2.10); adds theater
indoctrination (TI) guidance for 479 FTG aircrews (4.5.1.1 and 4.5.2.1); includes chief pilot
responsibilities during BIP (paragraph 4.6.1); requires night ground training for CSOs (paragraph
4.7.3.1); adds AI certification (paragraphs 4.11 and 4.11.2); revised Table 4.2, T-1A Pilot and
CSO Ground Training, to change Aircrew Flight Equpipment Training (LL06) from grounding
to nongrounding; allows CSOs to log traffic pattern stall currency in the simulator paragraph
4.13.2.7; incorporates UCT mission currencies (paragraphs 4.13.2.10 through 4.13.2.10.2); adds
and changes currency time requirements (Table 4.3); adds AI instructor development (ID) sorties
for IPs and creates ID sortie requirements for ICSOs (paragraph 4.13.3.1 and Table 4.4); enables
IPs to log ID sorties with ICSOs (paragraph 4.13.3.1.2); increases EP/CRM simulator
requirements for CSOs (Table 4.4); adds AI ID sortie profile guidance (Table 4.5). Attachment 5
incorporates guidance for UCT IPs accomplishing the BIP program.

       squadron DO’s review.
       1.2.6.3. Supervise overall scheduling, training, and progress of the flight CT program.
       1.2.6.4. Recommend an individually tailored BIP training program to the squadron
       commander based on the new IP’s past performance and experience.
       1.2.6.5. Ensure IPs complete BIP in a timely manner (approximately 6 months for the
       BIP long program and 3 months for the BIP short program).
       1.2.6.6. Regularly update the squadron commander on the status of all IPs in BIP
       training. Provide the squadron commander an estimated completion date and reason for
       delay for all IPs exceeding 6 months in the BIP long program and 3 months in the BIP
       short program.
       1.2.6.7. Fly at least one sortie with each IP in the BIP program. Note: The assistant flight
       commander may fly this sortie if the flight commander is not available.
       1.2.6.8. Ensure BIP documentation is maintained in a BIP folder and reviewed monthly,
       at a minimum.
       1.2.6.9. Verify new aircrew have met requirements before sending training
       documentation up the chain of command for review.
       1.2.6.10. Ensure the scheduler requests sorties/simulators required to meet CT
       requirements.
       1.2.6.11. Monitor currencies and requirements of assigned and attached aircrew.
       1.2.6.12. Ensure aircrew members only participate in sorties, missions, events, and tasks

       certification of MR or BAQ status, as applicable. Maintain training records in each
       member’s training folder until the AF Form 4348 is signed by the proper authority. Once
       the signed AF Form 4348 is placed in the training folder, corresponding training records
       may be removed.
       1.2.7.5. Establish a system for monitoring and planning training. After approval by the
       flight commander, ensure the scheduler requests the sorties required to meet the flight’s
       training requirements.
   1.2.8. All Supervisors. Supervisors at all levels are responsible for monitoring the progress
   of aircrew training to ensure timely progression through appropriate training phases and to
   identify areas for which additional training is needed.
   1.2.9. Individual Aircrew Members:
       1.2.9.1. Hand-carry all available training records to the gaining unit to assist in assessing
       qualifications and training requirements.
       1.2.9.2. Receive the required briefings prior to starting TI and flying the unit mission.
       1.2.9.3. Be responsible for completing training requirements and currencies within the
       guidelines of this instruction.
       1.2.9.4. Participate only in sorties, missions, events, and tasks for which they are
       adequately prepared, trained, certified, and current.
1.3. Phases of Training: (Note: All references to “days” in this publication are to “calendar
days” unless specifically noted otherwise.)
   1.3.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). This training is necessary to qualify aircrew
   for duties as a FP or first navigator [FN (CSO)] in the T-1A aircraft. See Chapter 2 for IQT
   program requirements.
   1.3.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). This training is necessary to upgrade T-1A
   FPs to IPs, and T-1 FNs to T-1 INs [instructor navigator (ICSO)]. In this phase, upgrades are
   only accomplished with a MAJCOM-approved syllabus. See Chapter 3 for MQT program
   requirements.
   1.3.3. Continuation Training (CT). This training ensures qualified aircrew maintain their
   proficiency and currency in T-1A aircraft. It provides minimum ground and flight training for
   aircrew while also developing thie instructor force and certifying aircrew in unit and local
   area requirements. Individual pilot CT requirements are based on unit assignment as
   inexperienced or experienced. See Chapter 4 for CT program requirements.
       1.3.3.1. Experienced or Inexperienced Designation. Squadron commanders will
       designate all pilots and CSOs as experienced or inexperienced as follows:
 10                                                       AFI11-2T-1V1 15 OCTOBER 2012


          1.3.3.1.1. Experienced. T-1A aircrew who meet the following criteria are designated
          as experienced after squadron commander certification:
              1.3.3.1.1.1. IPs certified as MR with 150 rated hours primary or instructor
              military flight time in the aircraft and 600 hours total rated military fixed-wing
              time and ICSOs certified as MR with a previous major weapon system (MWS)
              instructor rating and 50 rated hours instructor flight time in the T-1A or,
              1.3.3.1.1.2. IPs certified as MR with 250 rated hours primary or instructor
              military flight time in the aircraft and 450 hours total rated military fixed-wing
              time and ICSOs certified as MR with 250 rated hours primary flight time and 100
              rated hours instructor flight time in the T-1A.Note: For the purpose of this
              instruction, the wing commander, vice wing commander, OG commander, deputy
              OG commander, squadron commander, and squadron DO are designated as
              experienced pilots/CSOs.
          1.3.3.1.2. Inexperienced. Aircrew who do not qualify as experienced or who are not
          certified as such by the squadron commander are considered inexperienced. Aircrew
          designated as inexperienced will progress through a program managed by the flight
          commander to develop sound flying and instructional skills. Flight commanders will
          tailor each program based on the individual’s past flying experience and performance
          during IQT and MQT. No time limit is established to transition from inexperienced to
          experienced.
   1.3.4. Specialized Training. This training is necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned
   missions but is not required of every crewmember. One example of specialized training is
   functional check flight (FCF) pilot. Individuals recognized by the unit will accomplish
   appropriate formal course training to qualify personnel in these specialized areas, or comply
   with locally developed syllabi and squadron-developed training programs.
1.4. Training Concepts and Procedures:
   1.4.1. Squadron commanders will ensure training programs are designed to achieve the
   highest degree of qualification and proficiency consistent with flight safety and resource
   availability.
   1.4.2. Unless specifically directed, the squadron commander determines the level of
   supervision required to accomplish in-flight training. If the mission objectives include
   introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, an IP and ICSO may be
   required. If mission objectives require direct supervision, a squadron supervisor may be
   warranted.
1.5. Training Records and Reports. Units will:
   1.5.1. Maintain an aircrew training folder for each assigned or attached aircrew member. The
   training folder includes records of individual training and evaluations to include TI, BIP,
   specialized training, and certifications and is maintained according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1;
   AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program; and the RDS. Note:
   Units may specify additional training folder requirements.
      1.5.1.1. For each certification listed on the squadron letter of Xs, units will maintain
      documentation on an AF Form 4348 according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2. (AF Form 4348
AFI11-2T-1V1 15 OCTOBER 2012                                                                     11


       is prescribed in AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling
       out the form.) Once the signed AF Form 4348 is placed in the training folder,
       corresponding training records may be removed.
       1.5.1.2. Certification documents maintained in other locations (supervisor of flying, etc.)
       must also be annotated on the AF Form 4348.
   1.5.2. Use AF Form 4293, Student Activity Record, to document training and any unusual
   occurrence that could affect student progress. Instructors should annotate areas of difficulty.
   See Attachment 2 for instructions on filling out AF Form 4293.
   1.5.3. Document training in ARMS using the forms specified in AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
   Track the following information for all aircrew, as applicable:
       1.5.3.1. Ground training dates accomplished and expiration dates.
       1.5.3.2. Flying hours by 30, 60, and 90 days and cumulative totals.
       1.5.3.3. Events required, by total accomplished and amount remaining for the training
       cycle.
       1.5.3.4. Flying maneuver currency dates accomplished and expiration dates.
   1.5.4. Units may specify additional training folder requirements.
1.6. Aircrew Utilization:
   1.6.1. Commanders will ensure wing aircrew fill only authorized positions according to unit
   manning documents and status is properly designated. The overall objective is for aircrew to
   perform only operations-related duties. Supervisors may assign aircrew to valid, short-term
   tasks (escort officer, flying evaluation board member, mishap board member, etc.), but they
   must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of aircrew tasking, flying
   proficiency, currency, and experience.
   1.6.2. Duties required by various publications that may be assigned to aircrew position
   indicator (API)-1 are programmer, flying safety officer (FSO), supervisor of flying, mobility
   or contingency plans, training (except ARMS documentation), stan/eval liaison officer,
   squadron flight equipment officer, and other duties directly related to flying operations. API-
   1 individuals are not attached to wing staffs or fill wing staff positions unless total wing API-
   1/6 manning is 100 percent or better. Commanders will ensure wing staff aircrew (API-6)
   perform duties justified in MAJCOM manpower standards documents and authorized in unit
   manning documents.
1.7. Functional Check Flight Program. FCF program responsibilities and requirements are
specified in Attachment 3.
1.8. Sortie Allocation Guidance. Units will use the following information to determine priority
for unit training sortie allocation:
   1.8.1. Higher headquarters-directed missions and aerial events.
   1.8.2. Deployment support.
   1.8.3. Evaluations.
 12                                                         AFI11-2T-1V1 15 OCTOBER 2012


   1.8.4. API-1 CT. (Inexperienced pilots will receive sortie allocation priority over
   experienced pilots.)
   1.8.5. API-2 CT (if applicable).
   1.8.6. API-6 CT.
   1.8.7. API-8 CT or upgrade training.
   1.8.8. Supervisory, flights.
   1.8.9. Flight surgeon (FS) flying requirements.
   1.8.10. Indoctrination and familiarization flights.
   1.8.11. Other orientation flights.
1.9. Aircrew Graduate Evaluation Program. Refer to the appropriate formal course syllabus
and AFI 11-202, Volume 1, as supplemented, for aircrew graduate evaluation procedures. The
program may be accessed at https://www.my.af.mil/agepiftprod.
1.10. Progress Review. Refer to the appropriate formal course syllabus and AFI 11-202,
Volume 1, as supplemented, for procedures.
1.11. Letter of Xs. The squadron commander certifies aircrew training and certification items
appropriate for the unit’s missions on a monthly Letter of Xs according to AFI 11-202, Volume
1. See Attachment 4 of this instruction for a sample Letter of Xs. Note: The squadron DO may
accomplish the monthly review and certify the Letter of Xs if the squadron commander is not
available.
1.12. Fuel Conservation. It is the responsibility of all aircrew to conserve fuel to the maximum
extent possible. Individual crewmembers and supervisors at all levels will manage aviation fuel
as a limited commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization is considered throughout all
phases of mission planning and execution. Once the objectives of training are complete, sorties
are terminated at the earliest opportunity. Adherence to average sortie duration is not the driving
factor of whether to land the aircraft or continue the mission.
AFI11-2T-1V1 15 OCTOBER 2012                                                                   13

                          MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. MQT upgrades T-1 aircrew to IP or instructor navigator (IN) (ICSO) once they
successfully complete IQT. MQT for IPs is normally conducted in conjunction with IQT
according to the formal course pilot instructor training (PIT). MQT for ICSOs is normally
conducted under the ICSO MQ syllabus. See Chapter 4 for additional sorties and requirements to
become MR. Aircrew who have completed MQT:
   3.1.1. Are basic mission capable (BMC) according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
   3.1.2. May not be designated as MR until they complete TI (as applicable) and are certified
   by the squadron commander.
3.2. Prerequisites. All MQT upgrades must have completed T-1 IQT. Before entering MQT,
each aircrew member must comply with the appropriate formal course training syllabus and AFI
11-202, Volume 1, prerequisites.
3.3. Ground Training. When pilot MQT is not conducted in conjunction with IQT, minimum
ground training consists of the instructor ground training required by the formal course instructor
syllabus. CSO MQT follows the appropriate formal course training syllabus.
3.4. Flying Training. When pilot MQT is not conducted in conjunction with IQT, complete the
instructional sorties required by the formal course instructor syllabus. CSO MQT follows the
appropriate formal course syllabus.
3.5. Training Completion. MQT must be completed within the times prescribed in the formal
course syllabus. Aircrew should concentrate on their training and not be assigned to other duties
while they are in training status. The OG commander, or equivalent, may grant training time
extensions as appropriate, and units will document such waivers in the individual’s training
folder. MQT is completed through a successful mission evaluation according to AFI 11-202,
Volume 2, and AFI 11-2T-1, Volume 2.
3.6. Documentation. Document MQT in the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).
3.7. Sorties. When pilot MQT is not conducted in conjunction with IQT, units will log MQT
sorties as mission support sorties.
3.8. Loss of Mission (IP or IN [ICSO]) Qualification. Failure of a mission evaluation or a
commander-directed downgrade results in the loss of qualification. To regain qualification,
aircrew must, at a minimum, successfully complete a mission evaluation according to AFI 11-
202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2T-1, Volume 2.
3.9. Loss of Instructor Certification:
   3.9.1. IPs and ICSOs are decertified and placed in nonmission-ready (NMR) status if they:
       3.9.1.1. Fail any flight evaluation. To regain MR status, they must successfully
       reaccomplish the failed flight evaluation according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI
       11-2T-1, Volume 2.
       3.9.1.2. Fail a qualification, instrument, or boldface examination. To regain MR status,
       they must successfully reaccomplish the failed exam.
AFI11-2T-1V1 15 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 17


   3.9.2. IPs and ICSOs may retain instructor certification for loss of currency or failure to
   accomplish annual and semiannual flying requirements. However, their instruction duties
   will be limited according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and this instruction.
3.10. Instructor Requalification. The following provides criteria for requalifying instructors
(joint specialized undergraduate pilot training [JSUPT], PIT, and UCT) who have not performed
T-1 instructor flying duties for:
   3.10.1. A Period Up to 225 Days. The individual is placed in supervised status and at a
   minimum:
       3.10.1.1. Pilots must fly ID sorties with current and qualified experienced IPs or CSIPs
       until all expired currencies are updated. Refer to paragraph 4.3.3 and Table 4.2.
       3.10.1.2. CSOs must fly with a current and qualified experienced IP and current and
       qualified ICSO until all expired currencies are updated.
   3.10.2. A Period of 226 Days to 2 Years. The individual may complete a locally generated
   upgrade at the discretion of the OG commander. Develop an individual upgrade recurrency
   program taking into account the individual’s previous experience and currency. Send a copy
   of the proposed training to AETC/A3F for approval. Highly experienced instructors will
   conduct the flying training. A mission evaluation is completed for requalification.
       3.10.2.1. Items successfully accomplished during the course of requalification training
       may be used to establish initial dates for individual currency requirements in Table 4.3.
       This includes items accomplished during requalification evaluations. Items that are not
       accomplished are flown and updated with a current and qualified IP prior to designating
       the individual as MR.
   3.10.3. A Period of 2 to 5 Years. The individual completes the appropriate instructor
   requalification syllabus.
       3.10.3.1. CSIP candidates will complete the appropriate PIT or MAJCOM A3-approved
       syllabus.
   3.10.4. More Than 5 Years. The individual completes the appropriate PIT or MAJCOM

                                           Chapter 4

                                CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General. This chapter outlines the minimum training considered necessary to maintain a
viable T-1 aircrew corps to meet mission demands. Judicious scheduling of CT is required to
develop aircrew and ensure training standardization. Sufficient flying hours are included in the
annual FHP to allow every qualified aircrew member to accomplish all events and currencies
listed in this chapter. Squadron commanders will ensure the squadron FHP is managed to afford
all aircrews ample opportunity to complete required CT.
4.2. Training Cycle. Semiannual CT training cycles are 1 January to 30 June and 1 July to 31
December. Semiannual requirements are reviewed at the end of each cycle.
4.3. CT Administration:
   4.3.1. Meetings:
       4.3.1.1. Squadron commanders will direct and supervise quarterly CT meetings for
       aircrew members. The purpose of these meetings is to discuss standardization, safety,
       mission-related topics, instructional techniques, grading practices, and to increase general
       knowledge. A CRM topic or scenario should be discussed in each CT meeting referring
       to core concepts from AFI 11-290.
       4.3.1.2. Attendance at CT meetings is mandatory. Squadron commanders determine the
       conditions that will excuse attendance. The unit determines a method to track attendance
       as part of the go/no-go process for flight. Individuals not available for CT meetings will
       read the meeting minutes or be briefed by an operations supervisor before their next
       flight.
   4.3.2. Requirements. Minimum requirements are identified in this chapter, but units may
   direct additional training in a supplement to this instruction as necessary for individual
   requirements. ID sorties are the primary means for building and maintaining instructor force
   proficiency. Squadron commanders will develop ID sortie profiles that detail the minimum
   events and currency maneuvers T-1 aircrew must accomplish on each sortie.
   4.3.3. Prorating End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the
   squadron commander may prorate training requirements according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1,
   for aircrew members who were not available for flying duties.
       4.3.3.1. Prorate only to adjust for genuine circumstances of training nonavailability, not
       to mask training or planning deficiencies.
       4.3.3.2. Base prorating on consecutive days of nonflying in the training cycle (applies
       separately for each period of nonflying). Use the prorating allowance in Table 4.1 to
       determine the number of months to be prorated based on each period of consecutive days
       of nonflying.
       4.3.3.3. If IQT is reaccomplished, restart the individual’s training cycle at a prorated
       share following IQT completion.
AFI11-2T-1V1 15 OCTOBER 2012                                                                     19


        4.3.3.4. Round off prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 1/2 to the next
        lower whole number, but do not prorate any requirement below 1.
        4.3.3.5. For prorating purposes, newly assigned or converted aircrew and aircrew
        achieving qualification after the 15th of the month should be in CT on the 1st day of the
        following month. Events and sorties for the remainder of the training cycle may be
        prorated.

     4.3.4. Failure to Complete Annual and Semiannual CT Requirements:
        4.3.4.1. Aircrew members who fail to maintain physiological and medical certification,
        ground training, or flying training requirements according to Tables 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 are
        placed in NMR or non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) status, as applicable. Note:
        Instructor certification is not automatically lost for failure to complete flying training
        requirements according to paragraph 3.9.2. They will not fly in the new training cycle
        until a review is completed to determine the cause of the deficiency and if additional
        training is required.
        4.3.4.2. The OG commander (or AETC/A3V for AETC/A3V FEs) is reviewing and
        waiver authority. The reviewer should consider the type and magnitude of the deficiency
        and the individual’s experience level to determine if additional training, increased
        supervision, or a waiver to the previous training cycle requirements is warranted.
        Document waivers, with justification, in the individual’s training folder.
        4.3.4.3. Refer to AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings
        and Aviation Badges, for guidance on aviation suspension.
     4.3.5. Multiple Qualifications. Aircrews qualified in the T-1 and another MDS must
     complete all requirements for this instruction and as directed by the other MDS-specific
     intructions.
     4.3.6. Aircrew Categories and Training Requirements. All aircrew members will
     maintain minimum requirements according to AFI 11-202, Volumes 1 and 2; AFI 11-2T-1,
     Volume 2; and this instruction. For initial crediting of flying training event currencies, each
     applicable event listed in Table 4.3 is accomplished during TI or prior to MR certification.

   Additionally, there is not a requirement to establish a reference date for semiannual sortie
   and event requirements listed in Table 4.4 prior to MR certification.
      4.3.6.1. IPs and INs (ICSOs). Squadron commanders may assign BMC IPs to MR
      training status upon completion of TI and squadron commander instructor certification.
      BMC ICSOs may be assigned MR status upon completion of MQT and squadron
      commander instructor certification. In addition to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, training
      requirements, MR aircrew must accomplish recurring ground training; semiannual sortie
      and event; and currency requirements prescribed in Tables 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 to maintain
      MR status.
      4.3.6.2. FPs and FNs (CSOs). Squadron commanders may assign FPs to BAQ training
      status upon completion of TI. FNs may be assigned BAQ training status upon completion
      of IQT. In addition to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, training requirements, BAQ aircrew must
      accomplish recurring ground training prescribed in Table 4.2, currency requirements
      prescribed in Table 4.3, and semiannual EP/CRM training prescribed in Table 4.4.
          4.3.6.2.1. Restrictions. FPs may not fly simulated EPs, touch-and-goes, traffic
          pattern stalls, formation, airdrop, low-level, air refueling (AR) or AI events without
          an IP occupying a pilot seat.
4.4. Periodic Emergency Procedures and Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training:
   4.4.1. All pilots, to include FPs and senior officer pilots, will accomplish semiannual EP and
   CRM simulator training based on experience level, as described in paragraph 1.3.3 and as
   prescribed in Table 4.4. All CSOs accomplish annual EP and CRM training as prescribed in
   Table 4.4. Accomplish the mission in the simulator with a certified simulator instructor
   (CSI). According to AETCI 11-203, Civilian Flying Training Simulator Instruction
   Program, if there is not a CSI available, a simulator-certified T-1A IP may administer the
   simulator mission. IPs may take credit for an EP and CRM simulator when administering the
   simulator. If semiannual or annual requirements are not met, aircrew will not fly until EP and
   CRM training is accomplished. Note: Pilot weather category (PWC) requirements may be
   met during EP and CRM simulator training (see paragraph 4.8). Note: Experienced IPs may
   log semiannual EP and CRM simulator events with a qualified ICSO occupying the copilot
   seat.
   4.4.2. Because of local emergency scenarios, a locally generated simulator EP and CRM
   instructor guide is used when administering the simulator. The simulator mission must
   include:
      4.4.2.1. All critical action procedures and selected noncritical action emergencies.
      4.4.2.2. A cross section of thrust-deficient situations.
      4.4.2.3. Use of standby instruments.
      4.4.2.4. A reduced runway condition reading or hydroplaning stopping scenario. (Not
      applicable [NA] for CSO.)
      4.4.2.5. A discussion on wind shear and microburst hazards, detection, and escape
      procedures as well as a scenario experiencing such conditions on takeoff and landing.
AFI11-2T-1V1 15 OCTOBER 2012                                                                      21


       4.4.2.6. Applicable mishap lesson- learned identified by MAJCOM, wing, or unit safety
       staffs.
       4.4.2.7. At least one CRM practice scenario will be briefed, accomplished, and
       debriefed, using CRM core concepts from AFI 11-290.
       4.4.2.8. Autopilot usage and basic aircraft maneuvers (CSO only).
   4.4.2.9. Multiple full stop landings and touch-and-goes (CSO only).
       4.4.2.10. An “incapacitated pilot” scenario. (CSO only).
   4.4.3. All crew positions must attend a CRM refresher each calendar year. Track this
   training in ARMS.
4.5. TI Training (NA for ICSOs). The local pilot upgrade process starts with TI. During TI,
skills learned during IQT and MQT are applied to the local flying environment. New pilots will
fly a local familiarization mission prior to the specific TI category missions. The local
familiarization mission will focus on local departure, military operating areas, recovery, and
pattern operations. The local familiarization mission should be designed to ensure pilots are
familiar with general local flight conditions prior to TI training. Specific TI category missions
will emphasize local constraints, review common pilot errors, and highlight use of local anchors
and tracks, routes, and bases.
   4.5.1. Pilots in TI fly with assistant flight commanders and above, check pilots, or
   experienced pilots designated by the squadron commander.
       4.5.1.1. (479 FTG only) Pilots will fly all TI sorties with experienced instructors, of
       “like” crew position, as designated by the squadron commander. During TI, both the new
       and experienced pilot occupy the pilots seats, unless noted otherwise.
   4.5.2. Pilots will not perform instructor duties or the unit mission prior to completing TI.
       4.5.2.1. Pilots will accomplish the CSO-modified aircraft differences training prior to
       operating CSO-modified aircraft during TI.
   4.5.3. TI is recorded in the training folder.
   4.5.4. TI sorties are logged as training support sorties and may meet CT requirements during
   the period in which they are flown. As a minimum, fly the following missions:
       4.5.4.1. Local familiarization (must be flown first and may be flown in combination with
       any of the specific category missions).
       4.5.4.2. Transition.
       4.5.4.3. High-level navigation (should be flown as an out and back).
       4.5.4.4. Low-level navigation or airdrop (may be flown single-ship or formation). Note:
       An ICSO may occupy the copilot seat on low-level navigation; however, an experienced
       IP will occupy the jump seat.
       4.5.4.5. AR (does not apply to NAS Pensacola T-1 operations).
   4.5.5. When applicable, these missions may be combined if all training objectives are met.
   TI sorties include normal operations and emergency situations in the local area such as
   diversions, single runway operations, and emergency airfields.

   4.5.6. After successfully completing all TI, the squadron commander may certify the new
   pilot as MR or BAQ, as applicable. (Additional sorties and requirements to become MR or
   BAQ are at the discretion of the squadron commander.)
   4.5.7. PIT squadron commanders may tailor TI for previous MR IPs directly gained from
   JSUPT squadrons; however, at a minimum, a local familiarization sortie must be
   accomplished.
   4.5.8. Squadron commanders may tailor TI for FPs; however, at a minimum, a local
   familiarization sortie must be accomplished.
   4.5.9. Squadron commanders may waive TI for pilots that remain at the same base in which
   they completed MQT.
4.6. BIP Program: (Note: PIT, key wing personnel [wing commanders, wing vice
commanders, OG commanders, and OG deputy commanders], and former T-1 pilots with Naval
Flight Officer/UCT experience are exempt from this program.)
   4.6.1. Following TI, flight commanders or the chief pilot will assign each new IP to a highly
   qualified BIP who will monitor the new IP’s performance and provide guidance in all areas
   of job requirements, until the new IP has instructed through each category of training.
   4.6.2. To accommodate different experience levels of new IPs, there are long and short BIP
   courses. The BIP short program is for new IPs with previous instructor experience or
   extensive MWS experience. The BIP long program expands on the short program and is
   mandatory for first-assignment IPs and recommended for individuals who have not instructed
   or have limited MWS experience. The squadron commander will designate which program
   new IPs enter based on their performance during IQT, MQT, TI, and previous experience.
   4.6.3. The training prescribed in Attachment 5 is the minimum required. Squadron
   commanders should tailor each individual’s BIP program and provide additional training, as
   required.
   4.6.4. Sponsor sorties are logged as training support sorties and may meet CT requirements
   during the period in which they are flown.
4.7. Night Flying:
   4.7.1. Night Definition. For purposes of T-1A CT, night is defined as that period of
   darkness occurring from the end of evening civil twilight until the beginning of morning civil
   twilight. Night certification events and CT requirements may only be credited under the
   constraints of this definition. For purposes of logging “night time” on the AFTO Form 781,
   Arms Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, see AFI 11-401.
   4.7.2. Night Certification (Pilot only):
       4.7.2.1. Night certification consists of a dedicated training sortie with a night-certified IP
       or CSIP and spatial disorientation training accomplished in a MAJCOM-approved spatial
       disorientation training device. Note: Spatial disorientation training accomplished in
       conjunction with the pilot’s most recent physiological training satisfies this requirement.
       Accomplish all night training before the first night student or unit mission sortie. The
       night certification sortie is a transition sortie emphasizing spatial disorientation, night
       instruments, local area (transition out base), traffic pattern procedures, and visual
AFI11-2T-1V1 15 OCTOBER 2012                                                                     23


       references. The night certification sortie includes the following maneuvers: a simulated
       single-engine pattern and landing, no-flap pattern and landing, tactical overhead pattern
       and landing, and a circling approach.
       4.7.2.2. Pilots may log ID sorties in conjunction with the night certification sortie. See
       paragraph 4.13.3.1.
   4.7.3. Night Certification (CSO only). Night certification consists of accomplishing an
   instructor-led night orientation of the aircraft interior lighting system and discussion of night
   operating procedures, restrictions, and techniques.
   4.7.4. Night Restrictions. Pilots and CSOs who are not night certified will not fly at night
   (as defined by AFI 11-401) without a night-certified and current IP occupying a pilot seat in
   the aircraft. Touch-and goes are not accomplished at night with a CSO in the right seat.
   4.7.5. Documentation. Record night certification in the training folder and document on the
   Letter of Xs.
4.8. PWC Certification. (See AFI 11-2T-1, Volume 3, for PWC operational requirements and
information.) PWC certification is designed to reduce the exposure of pilots with limited
experience to risks inherent during periods of low ceiling and visibility. Before PWC 1
certification, pilots will demonstrate knowledge and proficiency in a simulator to a current PWC
1 pilot (flight commander or above). When calculating total time for the purpose of PWC
designation, do not include student, undergraduate pilot training (UPT), or “other” flight time.
Squadron commanders will certify pilots PWC 1 and document on the Letter of Xs.
   4.8.1. PWC 1. Qualified T-1A pilot designated as “experienced” (see paragraph 1.2.3.1).
   4.8.2. PWC 2. All other qualified T-1A pilots.
4.9. Uncontrolled (Nontowered) Airfield Certification. See AFI 11-2T-1, Volume 3. Record
the certification in the training folder and document on the Letter of Xs.
4.10. FCF Certification. See paragraph A3.6 for FCF aircrew requirements. Record the
certification in the training folder and document on the Letter of Xs.
4.11. AI Certification (479 FTG only):
   4.11.1. ICSO. AI certifies ICSOs in two-ship (live and simulated) AI operations of the CSO
   equipment in the modified T-1A. Individuals entered in AI certification training must be
   mission qualified. AI certification for ICSOs consists of a minimum of ground training
   (academics); one T25 mission (A/A mission); and one T-1A sortie (A/A mission). Note:
   Training certifies the ability for an ICSO to operate and instruct during AI operations
   missions in any student or instructor position of modified T-1A aircraft.
       4.11.1.1. A/A Academics (Mandatory). Instructor-led courses covering: AI geometry;
       air-to-air communication; weapons employment; intercept procedures; APG-70 function;
       APG-70 operation; T-1A concept; T-1A restrictions; mission planning; student errors and
       solutions; A/A TACAN operation; pilot/CSO/copilot intercept CRM; blue air roles and
       responsibilities; red air roles and responsibilities; and local procedures.
       4.11.1.2. T25 Simulators:
           4.11.1.2.1. Simulator 1: APG-70 operation and basic intercepts.

      4.11.1.3. T96 Simulators (Two planned, one minimum):
          4.11.1.3.1. Simulator 1: Mission scenario.
          4.11.1.3.2. Simulator 2: Student A/A mission scenario. The mission consists of the
          candidate instructing a certified AI ICSO acting in the role of “student.”
      4.11.1.4. Aircraft Sorties (Two planned, one minimum). Note: Candidate may
      occupy the copilot or CSO and jump or instructor seats for the aircraft sorties. This
      enables maximum certification training, to include IPs during dedicated A/A sorties.
   4.11.2. Pilot. AI certifies IPs in the T-1A AI mission. AI certification training is
   administered by an AI-certified IP occupying the right seat and upgrade or AI-certified ICSO
   occupying the jump seat crew position. An AI-certified or upgrade ICSO directs AIs from the
   CSO console to effect IP AI certification training. AI certification for IPs consists of a
   minimum of ground training (academics), one T25 (over-the- shoulder A/A observation
   mission), and one T-1A flight (A/A mission).
      4.11.2.1. A/A Academics (Mandatory). Instructor-led courses covering: AI geometry;
      air-to-air communication; weapons employment; intercept procedures; APG-70 function;
      T-1A concept; T-1A restrictions; mission planning; student errors and solutions; A/A
      TACAN operation; pilot/CSO/copilot intercept CRM; blue air roles and responsibilities;
      red air roles and responsibilities; and local procedures; etc.
      4.11.2.2. T96 Simulators:
          4.11.2.2.1. Simulator 1: Basic intercepts and APG-70 function. The intent of the
          mission is for pilot orientation and familiarization of the AGP-70 function and
          required CSO interaction to operate the radar. Training does not require proficiency
          in operating the APG-70.
      4.11.2.3. Aircraft Sorties (Two planned, one minimum). Note: Sortie consists of an
      A/A-certified IP in the right seat; ICSO in the jump seat; and candidate ICSO and A/A
      certified ICSO occupying the CSO and instructor seats, in any combination. AIs are
      accomplished by the candidate or instructor occupying the CSO seat.
          4.11.2.3.1. Sortie 1: Basic or student A/A mission (mandatory).
          4.11.2.3.2. Sortie 2: Basic or student A/A mission.
4.12. Ground Training Requirements. Ground training accomplished during IQT, MQT, TI,
and BIP may be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was
accomplished. AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and Table 4.2 establish aircrew ground training
requirements.
   4.12.1. Units will ensure all aircrew attend CRM training which builds on the basic CRM
   skills taught in undergraduate and formal training units (FTU). This is a calendar year
   requirement and is tracked in ARMS. Dual-qualified pilots will accomplish CRM in their
   primary aircraft. Briefings and debriefings include the core curriculum of CRM training
   according to AFI 11-290 and applicable MAJCOM guidance.
   4.12.2. For ancillary, readiness, mobility, and other training requirements, refer to the
   Advanced           Distributed        Learning          Service        website         at

 Notes:
 1. Required before the first flight of the month. An unsatisfactory boldface exam results in grounding
 until successful reaccomplishment. Operations limits are correctable to 100 percent. Use approved T-1
 Boldface and operations limits worksheet found on AETC Standardization and Evaluation Web site
 (available at: https://www-r.aetc.af.mil/do/dof/download.asp).
 2. Aircrew noncurrent for water survival training are limited to over-water operations to remain within
 gliding distance of land.

4.13. Flying Training. All aircrew will maintain currency requirements as applicable in Table
4.3 and sortie/event requirements shown in Table 4.4. The OG/FTG commander or equivalent
(AETC/A3V for AETC FEs) is waiver authority for these requirements. Document waivers in
the individual’s training folder. All maneuvers are flown according to Air Force instructions,
directives, policies, and flight manuals.
   4.13.1. Restrictions. Aircrew will not fly sorties, events, mission, and currency items in
   which they are not qualified, current, and certified.
   4.13.2. Currency and Recurrency. Unless otherwise restricted, aircrew may log currencies
   during any sortie or mission if the maneuver or item is demonstrated. Noncurrent individuals
   will not perform that sortie, mission, or event except for the purpose of regaining currency.
26                                                       AFI11-2T-1V1 15 OCTOBER 2012


  Unless otherwise specified, supervisory requirements pertaining to recurrency may be
  satisfied in the flight position that offers best control of the mission, as determined by the
  squadron commander. See Table 4.3 for T-1A currency requirements.
     4.13.2.1. Landing Currency. Landing currency is required to maintain basic aircraft
     qualification. Currency is regained by flying at least three satisfactory landings with a
     current IP. Loss of landing currency exceeding 90 days requires the following action.
     (Note: Timing starts from the last landing.):
         4.13.2.1.1. For 91 to 135 Days. Same as paragraph 4.13.2.1, plus an instructor-
         supervised emergency procedure and instrument review session (normal, emergency,
         and instrument procedures).
         4.13.2.1.2. For 136 to 225 Days. Same as paragraphs 4.13.2.1 and 4.13.2.1.1, plus a
         recurrency flight, qualification written examinations, and an emergency procedure
         evaluation (EPE). AF Form 8 documentation is not required.
         4.13.2.1.3. For 226 Days to 39 Months at the End of a Nonflying Assignment or
         51 Months at the End of any Active Flying Assignment. Same as paragraphs
         4.13.2.1.1 and 4.13.2.1.2, plus a locally administered qualification program approved
         by the OG/FTG commander, to include an instrument or qualification evaluation. For
         greater periods of time, see AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
     4.13.2.2. Instrument Approach Currency. Instrument approach currency may only be
     updated at night, during actual instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), or during
     simulated IMC with a qualified pilot acting as a safety observer. Additionally, pilots may
     update currency with a proficiency-current ICSO occupying the right seat as a safety
     observer. If currency is lost, regardless of PWC, instrument approaches are not flown
     until currency is regained by flying an instrument approach with a current IP.
     4.13.2.3. Night Landing Currency. See paragraph 4.7.1 for requirements to log night
     landings for CT. Night landing currency updates basic landing currency. Night landing
     currency must be regained by accomplishing three satisfactory night landings with a
     current IP.
     4.13.2.4. Formation Currency (Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training [SUPT]
     and PIT IPs only). Currency must be logged during any formation flight. Currency must
     be regained by flying formation with a current IP.
     4.13.2.5. Low-Level Currency. Instructors and FNs will fly a route entry or exit and at
     least two legs of a locally approved low-level or a published military training route
     (instrument route [IR], visual route [VR], or slow route [SR]). CSOs may only credit
     currency while occupying the right seat and ICSOs may credit currency from either the
     right or jump seat. Currency must be regained by flying a low level with a current IP.
     4.13.2.6. Precontact and Contact Currency (SUPT and PIT IPs only). Each IP flies
     precontact (astern) and contact as a receiver. Currency may be regained by flying the
     maneuvers with a current IP.
     4.13.2.7. Traffic Pattern Stall Currency. Pilots will fly a minimum of one turning and
     one straight-ahead traffic pattern stall. CSOs will fly a minimum of one straight-ahead
     traffic pattern stall.CSOs accomplish while occupying the right seat. Currency must be

      regained by flying the maneuvers with a current IP. Note: CSOs may credit traffic
      pattern stall currency in the simulator.
      4.13.2.8. FCF Currency. Certified IPs must fly an FCF flight to maintain currency.
      Currency must be regained by flying with an FCF-current IP. See Attachment 3 for loss
      of currency exceeding 180 days.
      4.13.2.9. Proficiency Currency (CSOs only). Proficiency currency is required to
      maintain basic aircraft qualification. In order to credit currency, individuals must occupy
      the right seat for a minimum of 1 hour, monitor at least one takeoff and landing, and
      accomplish at least one autopilot-coupled instrument approach. Individuals must regain
      currency by flying the proficiency requirements with a current and qualified IP at the
      controls or ICSO in the jump seat. Loss of currency greater than 120 days requires the
      following actions:
         4.13.2.9.1. For 120 to 180 Days. Same as paragraph 4.13.2.9, plus an instructor-
         supervised emergency procedure and instrument review session (normal, emergency,
         and instrument procedures).
         4.13.2.9.2. For 181 to 225 Days. Same as paragraphs 4.13.2.9 and 4.13.2.9.1,
         qualification written examinations, and an EPE administered in the simulator.
         Documenting the AF Form 8 is not required. The review session, examinations, and
         EPE are accomplished prior to flying the proficiency requirements for recurrency.
         4.13.2.9.3. For 226 Days to 39 Months at the End of a Nonflying Assignment or
         51 Months at the End of any Active Flying Assignment. For greater periods of
         time see AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
      4.13.2.10. AI Currency. All certified ICSOs and IPs will maintain AI currency to
      maintain certification. ICSOs and IPs may credit AI currency in the T-1 OFT.
         4.13.2.10.1. ICSO AI Currency. Certified ICSOs will fly a minimum of two
         intercepts every 90 days. Currency must be credited on student missions as an
         instructor in either the jump or instructor seat, or for proficiency in either the copilot
         or CSO seat. Currency may be regained by flying a dedicated AI sortie with a current
         ICSO directly monitoring (over-the-shoulder) (copilot/jump or CSO/instructor
         complement).
         4.13.2.10.2. IP AI Currency. Certified IPs will fly a minimum of two intercepts,
         one as blue air and one as red air, every 90 days. Currency may be credited on student
         or CT sorties. Currency may be regained by flying a dedicated A/A sortie with an AI-
         certified instructor in the right seat and an AI-certified instructor in the jump seat.

4. Currency applies to those individuals certified.
5. CSO/ICSO may credit in the simulator.
6. See Attachment 3.
   4.13.3. Semiannual Sortie/Event Requirements. Table 4.4 establishes the minimum
   semiannual sortie/event requirements for all MR IPs and ICSOs. FPs, senior officer pilots,
   and FNs are required to meet currency requirements prescribed in Table 4.3 and EP/CRM
   simulator event requirements of Table 4.4.
       4.13.3.1. ID Sorties. All experienced JSUPT and PIT IPs will fly a minimum of one ID
       sortie dedicated to each syllabus category of training per semiannual period: transition,
       navigation, formation, air drop (AD), and air refueling. Inexperienced IPs will fly two ID
       sorties. All UCT IPs will fly a minimum of one ID sortie dedicated to each syllabus
       category of training per semiannual period: transition, navigation, low-level navigation,
       and AI, as applicable. ICSOs will fly a minimum of one ID sortie per semiannual period
       dedicated to each syllabus category of training per semiannual period: low-level
       navigation and AI (AI-certified only). Use Table 4.5 as a guide to establish squadron ID
       sortie profiles. The remaining ID sorties may be flown in any syllabus category and
       should be tailored to meet developmental requirements, as determined by the squadron
       commander.
           4.13.3.1.1. Logging ID Sorties. ID sorties are not logged on formal training syllabus
           missions. For purposes of CT, an aircraft sortie is defined from initial takeoff to full-
           stop landing. Due to differences in average T-1A sortie duration compared to that of
           other undergraduate MDSs, if aircraft sortie duration exceeds 2.0 hours, each pilot
           or CSO may log up to two ID sorties. During dedicated ID sorties, plan for no more
           than two profiles on one aircraft sortie (for example, AR/AD, transition/formation,
           AI/low-level navigation).
AFI11-2T-1V1 15 OCTOBER 2012                                                                29


             4.13.3.1.1.1. UCT IPs. UCT IPs may log low-level navigation and AI ID sorties
             with an ICSO occupying the copilot seat. All other ID sorties are flown with
             another IP.
      4.13.3.2. Semiannual Sortie Events. Events, when accomplished, may be dual logged.
      For example, a single-engine precision approach may log single-engine precision
      approach, precision approach, and instrument approach. Currency may also be updated if
      flown according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1; AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules;
      and this publication.
         4.13.3.2.1. Events may be logged during formal training syllabus missions when the
         pilot demonstrates the maneuver.
         4.13.3.2.2. Student Events. Log student events based on the number of events
         flown and instructor-student ratio. Log one student event for each formal training
         syllabus event flown. More than one student event may be logged for each total
         sortie.

Notes
1. See paragraph 4.13.3.1.
2. ICSO requirement is “1” low-level ID sortie if not AI-certified.
3. See paragraphs 4.3.6.1 and 4.3.6.2; senior officers, FPs, and FNs accomplish one per
semiannual period.
4. Certified pilots only. See paragraph 4.7.
5. The 12 FTW and attached certified pilots will fly a minimum of one per semiannual period.
6. May be logged at termination of an instrument approach to low-closed pattern at home or
auxiliary field. Sidestep maneuver does not fulfill “circling approach” requirement.
7. Fly a complete procedure (high or low altitude) from the instrument approach fix (IAF) to
landing or missed approach.

                       FUNCTIONAL CHECK FLIGHT PROGRAM

A3.1. Overview. The OG commander will designate one FCF pilot as the chief of FCF,
designate one lead FCF pilot for each operationally assigned aircraft, and determine the need for
additional FCF pilots. He or she assigns the chief FCF pilot to the OG. The lead FCF pilots are
assigned to the OG at the discretion of the OG commander. The chief FCF pilot may act as his or
her MDS-specific lead FCF pilot. The OG commander will appoint FCF pilots and FCF IPs by
memorandum.
A3.2. FCF Chief Responsibilities. The FCF chief:
   A3.2.1. Supervises and administers the wing FCF program according to AFI 21-101,
   Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management; TO 1-1-300, Acceptance/Functional
   Check Flights and Maintenance Operational Checks; TO 1T-1A-6CF-1, Checkflight—
   Acceptace and Functional Procedures, T-1A; and MAJCOM and local policy and
   procedures.
   A3.2.2. Works closely with maintenance quality assurance personnel.
   A3.2.3. Maintains an FCF read file available to all FCF pilots for review before flying FCF
   sorties.
   A3.2.4. Ensures FCF crews maintain a high level of proficiency and knowledge of
   maintenance requirements to produce a quality aircraft for mission accomplishment.

           A5.1.2.1.1. BIP sorties are those flown by the BIP with the IP. All BIP sorties are
           flown with the assigned BIP, flight unit stan/eval monitors (USEM), or supervisors
           (assistant flight commander or above) in the IP’s chain of command. These flights
           further develop the IP’s flying proficiency and instructional techniques. ID sortie
           requirements may be logged during BIP sorties.
           A5.1.2.1.2. During the sortie, BIPs will discuss instructional techniques, planning
           profiles, student progress, grading practices, local flying policies, common student
           errors, and pitfalls the new IP should avoid. Document these sorties in the IP’s BIP
           record.
           A5.1.2.1.3. Multiple mission requirements may be flown on one BIP sortie. A
           minimum of one BIP mission is flown in each of the following categories of training:
              A5.1.2.1.3.1. Transition.
              A5.1.2.1.3.2. Navigation out and back (may include low level).
              A5.1.2.1.3.3. AR. (N/A to UCT)
              A5.1.2.1.3.4. AD. (N/A to UCT)
              A5.1.2.1.3.5. Low-Level Navigation (UCT only). This sortie is flown with an
              ICSO in the copilot seat and BIP in the jump seat. Attempt to fly this sortie after
              the IP has accomplished at least three student (undergraduate or CSO-upgrade)
              low-level missions.
              A5.1.2.1.3.6. AI (UCT only). This sortie is flown with ICSOs in the copilot and
              CSO seats and BIP in the jump seat. Attempt to fly this sortie after the IP has
              accomplished at least two student (undergraduate or upgrade) AI missions.
       A5.1.2.2. Sponsor Sorties (N/A to UCT):
           A5.1.2.2.1. BIPs, USEMs, or supervisors (assistant flight commander or above) in
           the IP’s chain of command fly sponsor sorties with the IP’s students to ensure
           effective technique and instruction. BIPs actively fly with the IP’s students or observe
           the IP from the jump seat.
           A5.1.2.2.2. IPs will fly a series of three student sorties in each category with the
           same student or students, after which the BIP will fly with that student. BIPs will
           provide feedback to the IP (within 2 workdays) on instructional techniques and
           grading practices. Document all sponsor sorties and debriefings in the new IP’s BIP
           training record. The categories are as follows:
              A5.1.2.2.2.1. Transition.
              A5.1.2.2.2.2. Navigation (including one low level).
              A5.1.2.2.2.3. Mission familiarization (one formation, one AR, and one AD).
A5.2. BIP Short Program (N/A to UCT). This program lasts approximately 1 to 3 months and
is designed for IPs who have previous instructor or extensive MWS experience. Prior to
accomplishing any student sorties, the squadron commander will brief the new pilot of his or her
instructor responsibilities. The squadron DO may accomplish the briefing if the commander is
not available.

       A5.2.2.1. BIP Sorties. BIP sorties are those flown by the BIP with the new IP. All BIP
       sorties are flown with the assigned BIP, flight USEMs, or supervisors (assistant flight
       commander or above) in the new IP’s chain of command. These flights further develop
       the new IP’s flying proficiency and instructional techniques. A minimum of one BIP
       sortie is flown in any category of training (transition, navigation, AR, AD, or formation).
       During the sortie, BIPs will discuss instructional techniques, planning profiles, student
       progress, grading practices, pitfalls to avoid, local flying policies, and common student
       errors. Document all sorties and debriefings in the new IP’s BIP record.
       A5.2.2.2. Sponsor Sorties. BIPs, flight USEMs, or any supervisor (assistant flight
       commander or above) in the IP’s chain of command will fly sponsor sorties with the IP’s
       students to ensure effective technique and instruction.
          A5.2.2.2.1. A minimum of one sponsor sortie is flown (in any category of training)
          after the students have had sufficient exposure and influence to the new IP’s
          techniques. BIPs may actively fly with the new IP’s students or observe the new IP
          from the jump seat.
          A5.2.2.2.2. Document all sorties and debriefings in the new IP’s BIP record.

                PILOT INSTRUCTOR TRAINING RE-BLUE PROGRAM

A6.1. Re-Blue Program. The purpose of the Re-Blue Program is to increase the quality of PIT
instruction. This is accomplished by giving PIT IPs the opportunity to interact and fly with
undergraduate flying training (UFT) student pilots in all categories of flying and ground training
instruction. IP re-bluing should be accomplished at the discretion of the squadron commander
after considering manning, PFT, and other constraints. PIT IPs who have not flown with a T-1A
UFT student within 2 years prior to their IP letter should spend a week flying with UFT students
between 6 months to 1 year of receiving their IP certification at PIT. Additionally, all PIT IPs
should spend a week flying with UFT students after instructing at PIT for 3 years.
A6.2. PIT IP Responsibilities. PIT IPs:
   A6.2.1. Contact the host squadron point of contact to determine additional requirements or
   documentation.
   A6.2.2. Are current in all requirements and training events prior to traveling to the UFT host
   squadron.
   A6.2.3. Report to the host squadron DO.
   A6.2.4. Sample as many different categories of flying and ground training as possible while
   at the host squadron.
   A6.2.5. Bring back AFTO Form 781 extracts and documentation required for logging CT
   training at home station.
A6.3. Host Squadron Responsibilities. Host squadrons:
   A6.3.1. Utilize the PIT IP to the maximum extent possible after consulting with the PIT IP.
   The PIT IP should be treated and scheduled like any other “line IP.” Schedule the PIT IP for
   student sorties over CT sorties to maximize training objectives.
   A6.3.2. Schedule at least one local familiarization sortie to acquaint the PIT IP with local
   procedures and pattern or area references.
   A6.3.3. Attempt to fly the IP with students in all categories and varying proficiency levels so
   he or she can get an accurate picture of the UFT environment.

                             BREAK-IN-TRAINING PROGRAM

A7.1. Recent UFT T-1A Graduates. UFT T-1A graduates who will exceed 30 days between
class graduation and follow-on flying training (FTU, PIT) are authorized to fly additional T-1A
aircraft training sorties after graduation. The purpose of these sorties is to maintain proficiency,
not experience new maneuvers or complete upgrades.
A7.2. FTU/PIT-Bound Graduates. At their discretion, FTU/PIT-bound graduates may
participate on a noninterference basis (sorties will not be generated solely for BIT purposes).
Graduates may fly with an IP or CSIP approximately once a week in a variety of categories, with
special emphasis on instrument training and CRM. Makeup sorties are not required due to
unavailability. Unlimited aircrew training device sorties are authorized on a space available
basis.
A7.3. Graduate Pilots. Graduate pilots may occupy any seat and should attempt to accomplish
one landing per sortie. Graduate CSOs may occupy the copilot, jump, or CSO seat.To ensure a
safe level of proficiency is maintained, graduates must complete life support/aircrew flight
equipment training and boldface testing according to Table 4.2 and local directives. MQF testing
is not required.
A7.4. Logging Training. Log all training according to AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
Instructors may log events according to this instruction.
A7.5. Orientation Sorties. Wing commanders may authorize orientation sorties for any
graduate in any wing or group aircraft according to AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-401/AETC Sup (for
example, a T-1A graduate awaiting T-6 PIT may be authorized orientation sorties in the T-6).
