       code provide for the removal and temporary impoundment of POVs parked illegally for
       unreasonable periods, interfering with military operations, creating a safety hazard,
       disabled by incident, left unattended in a restricted or controlled area or abandoned.” ―I
       agree to reimburse any agency or contractor for the cost of towing, storing and disposing

    2.6. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges.
       2.6.1. Per USFJI 31-205, suspension or revocation of driving privileges applies on a
       USFJ installation, and is applicable as outlined below. This suspension and/or restriction
       also applies to mopeds, motorcycles, or any other motorized vehicle, while in effect.
       When an individual’s privileges are suspended or revoked for failure to maintain JCI or
       liability insurance, road tax, base registration, or vehicle inspection government motor
       vehicle (GOV) privileges will not be affected. GOV and POV privileges will be affected
       for the same period for all other offenses.
           2.6.1.1. Suspension or revocation applies both on and off the installation.
       2.6.2. Personnel under 20 years of age, regardless of their military component or DoD
       affiliation, observed or determined to have consumed an alcoholic beverage and then
       operated or were in physical control of a vehicle, i.e., to include the capability or capacity
       to maneuver controls, regardless of their blood alcohol content (BAC) or breath alcohol
       content (BrAC), will have their driving privileges suspended or revoked. The presence of
       the odor of alcohol is sufficient to process underage individuals under this provision. For
       the purpose of this instruction, a suspension is for 6 months or less, revocations are
       greater than 6 months. Suspension/revocation affects both POV and GOV privileges.

        Security Forces personnel to issue a preliminary letter of suspension/revocation and
        require the subject/violator to surrender their USFJ form 4EJ at the time of the
        incident. Offenses requiring immediate suspension/revocation are identified in table

   5.1. The traffic point system provides a uniform administrative device to impartially judge
   driving performance. This system is not a disciplinary measure or a substitute for punitive
   action. Nothing in this table supersedes the installation commander or the designee’s
   prerogative to issue, suspend, revoke, adjust, deny or reinstate installation driving privileges
   unless prohibited by other instruction. Driving a vehicle (GOV or POV) on and off base is a
   privilege granted by the installation commander. All citations issued by a competent
   authority, to include but not limited to, Japanese Police, USAF Security Forces, USN Master
   at Arms, Security Forces Augmenter’s and properly trained parking wardens, etc, will be
   logged in SFMIS and assessed points, suspensions or revocations as outlined in this
   instruction. Refer to Table 5.1 for specific points and suspension/revocation periods. (See
   Attachment 2).
   5.2. Traffic Citation Rebuttal Process.
      5.2.1. In the event a violator feels they were issued a citation that was unjust, they may
      submit a written rebuttal requesting the citation be dismissed. Rebuttal must be submitted
      within 10 duty days of it being issued. Late rebuttals will not be accepted. See
      Attachment 6.
          5.2.1.1. Violators must submit a detailed memorandum articulating the circumstances
          of the citation and any evidence that substantiates their claims. Military members
          must have their rebuttals endorsed by their unit commander.
          5.2.1.2. The violator must provide the rebuttal memorandum to the 35 SFS Reports
          and Analysis within the 10 duty days; the rebuttal must be endorsed by the unit CC
          and a copy of the citation attached along with any evidence the violator wishes to
          submit.
          5.2.1.3. Reports and Analysis will package the request and forward to the 35
          SFS/CC, who will validate the offense; if the 35 SFS/CC finds the citation is not
          valid, the citation will be dismissed and the citation will be removed from the
          violators’ traffic record. If the 35 SFS/CC finds the citation valid, it will be forwarded
          to the 35 MSG/CD, who will either uphold the citation or dismiss it. The MSG/CD
          will return the package to Reports and Analysis with his/her decision. Reports and
          Analysis will notify the violator of the outcome, and take appropriate actions based
          on the MSG/CD decision. The 35 MSG/CD is the final decision authority.

     Notice, simultaneously when they come in contact with or are notified of suspected
     abandoned vehicles. This will be documented in the 35 SFS blotter. All other cases
     outside of abandonment will warrant the issuance of ―just‖ the DD Form 2504.
     6.4.2. The pink copy of the ticket will be placed on the vehicle. The violator will be
     allowed 72 hours to report to the BDOC to clear the ticket and abandoned vehicle notice.
     6.4.3. The individual will report to the Building 646 or BDOC to verify the issue has
     been resolved.
     6.4.4. If after 72 hours the violator has not reported to the BDOC, the DD Form 2504
     will be acted upon by 35 SFS/S2I, one copy will be placed with the vehicle, i.e. case file
     and one copy will be forward to the individual’s unit. 35 SFS/S2I will attempt to identify
     or locate the registered owner of the vehicle. If unable to do so they will impound the
     vehicle, and will be documented in the blotter. Outside support will be provided as
     follows:
     6.4.5. IAW AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, 35 LRS will provide 24-hour towing
     support.
        6.4.5.1. Dispatch operations may be called to move disabled POVs, non-appropriated
        fund (NAF) or AAFES vehicles causing traffic safety or fire fighting obstacles on
        base. Requests warrant immediate action.
        6.4.5.2. Only 35 SFS may make these requests.
        6.4.5.3. Wrecker operators are not liable for any damages incurred to any POV, NAF
        or AAFES vehicle being towed or removed under these conditions.
  6.5. Form Documentation. DD Form 2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report: Contact will be
  made with the owner’s assigned or last assigned (if members has departed MAB) CCF & CC
  via telephone, email and/or memorandum informing them of the impounded vehicle and
  parameters of the 35 FWI 31-204. The following procedures apply and will be documented
  in the blotter.
     6.5.1. 35 SFS/S2I contacts 35 LRS Vehicle Management Flight (35 LRS/LGRV) to
     arrange for the vehicle to be towed to the impoundment lot. All due care and caution
     should be exercised during impoundment actions. Personnel from 35 LRS/LGRV and 35
     SFS/S2I are not liable for any damage(s) that may incur during the impoundment process.
     6.5.2. Once the vehicle has been impounded, make an entry in the 35 SFS blotter stating
     the make, model, year, registration and/or license number of the vehicle and location
     from which it was impounded. Impounded vehicles will be thoroughly searched and
     inventoried via DD form 2506 by 35 SFS/S2I unless the impoundment was based on
     criminal activities. If so, seek proper search authority. A DD Form 2506 will be
     completed for each vehicle impounded. Annotate any valuable personal property found in
     the vehicle. If the vehicle is locked, a Slim-Jim will be utilized to unlock the vehicle, if
     the vehicle cannot be opened via the Slim-Jim a visual inventory will be done through the
     window as not to cause damage to the vehicle.
36                                                               35FWI31-204 28 MAY 2010

     will be forwarded to him/her via certified mail stating their vehicle has been impounded.
     The owner or lien holder will be advised if no reply is received by the applicable date (60
     days of the date the DD Form 2507 and letter is mailed); the vehicle will be disposed of
     through a local junkyard or other authorized agencies. The owner or lien holder may
     claim the vehicle or release it to the government by completing the release on the back of
     the DD Form 2507. The vehicle will not be driven out of the impoundment lot unless all
     base regulatory requirements (i.e. insurance, registration, safe operating order, etc.) are
     met. If the vehicle is towed out of the vehicle impound lot, other than a wrecker, an ―A‖
     ―I‖ or ―T‖ framed tow device or bar will be utilized. If the owner or lien holder cannot be
     identified, release the vehicle to the local junkyard, or other authorized agency 60 days
     from the date the vehicle was impounded.
     6.5.4. When an owner is not verified, the DD Form 2504 will be annotated and the
     vehicle will be disposed of IAW AFI 31-206 and DoD Manual 4160.21-M.

  register the vehicle through 35 SFS/S5/PR based on the revocation of their driving privileges.
     6.6.1. If a vehicle was impounded due to expired insurance, the owner is required to have
     a valid insurance policy prior to retrieving the vehicle.
     6.6.2. If the Japanese inspection is expired, the vehicle owner will have to obtain a
     temporary license plate from 35 SFS/S5P before they can retrieve the vehicle.
     6.6.3. If the vehicle was impounded as a result of a vehicle accident, it is considered
     evidence; it will not be released until the case is complete and approval is granted by 35
     SFS/S2I and 35 FW/JA.
     6.6.4. If the vehicle was impounded as a result of possible abandonment, the vehicle will
     not be released until approval is granted by 35 SFS/S2I.
     6.6.5. In all cases, a letter signed by the vehicle owner’s unit commander, first sergeant
     or agency chief is required to retrieve the vehicle.
     6.6.6. After 60 days, 35 SFS/S5P will have the authority to deregister abandoned
     vehicles via the appropriate LTO and GOJ agencies. All attempts to contact the owner

Terms
Ability—The physical proximity, coupled with the motor skills to put the vehicle in motion by
manipulation of the ignition, gears, and/or release of the emergency brake. A young child being
left unattended in a vehicle could have the ability and physical motor skills to release the
emergency brake and put a vehicle into motion.
Access—The right and privilege to enter or utilize.
35 FW Form 68EJ, Provisional Visitor/Vehicle Pass—Identifies individuals and vehicles not
possessing appropriate DoD and installation media. Passes issued from other installations are not
valid for entry onto Yokota AB. The duration of the pass will coincide with the length of the
visit. The sponsor, not the visitor determines pass length.
Aggressive/High Risk Driver—The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
defines aggressive driving as ―the operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is
likely to endanger persons or property.‖ Aggressive driving is a traffic offense, not a criminal
offense like road rage (NHTSA, Aggressive Driving Prosecutors’ Planner). According to
NHTSA there have always been aggressive drivers. Incidents leading to crashes, injuries and
even fatalities are becoming more prevalent. Aggressive driving manifests itself as a
combination of reckless operating characteristics resulting in highway behavior dangerous to
other roadway users, and contributes to needless losses. These behaviors include a list of
―symptoms‖ that create serious risk when combined with other variables such as vehicles, other
drivers, traffic congestion, visibility and road conditions. Some of these aggressive driver
behaviors
include; excessive speeding, tailgating, erratic lane—changes, excessive acceleration and
braking, unsafe passing, intentional red light running, passing off the traveled portion of
highway, lane change violations, speeding beyond the traffic flow and failure to yield at ramps or
intersections.
Installation Entry/Exit Point Checks—Administrative inspections directed by the installation
commander designed to protect the readiness, health and welfare of the installation.
Drunk or Impaired—Any level of intoxication that is sufficient to impair the rational and full
exercise of the mental or physical faculties. The term drunk is used in relation to intoxication by
alcohol. The term impaired is used in relation to intoxication by other substances other than
alcohol.
Entry Authority List (EAL)—Authenticated, typewritten, chronological source document
identifying guests by full name, destination and the inclusive period which access is required.
The sponsor assumes responsibility of the conduct and action(s) of their guests while on the
installation. EALs are designed to give access to individuals, not their POVs. If vehicle access is
required, the sponsor will annotate and verify the visitor meets entry and/or insurance
requirements.
Japanese Compulsory Insurance (JCI)—Required by Article 5 of the Automobile Liability
Security Law of Japan. JCI provides personal injury type coverage with limits. Under this law,
no automobile may be driven until the owner shows proof of the compulsory insurance. It does
not cover any liability for any property a vehicle operator might damage by operating a motor
vehicle.
 42                                                                 35FWI31-204 28 MAY 2010


Major Accident—An accident that causes a fatality or injuries, the vehicle can not be moved
under its own power, it sustained over $10,000 in damage.
Minor Accident—An accident where no one was injured, sustained less than $10,000 in-damage
and the vehicle is able to move under its own power.
On Base—The areas confined within .
Off Base Jurisdiction IAW USFJI 31—203, Law Enforcement Procedures in Japan, the areas
in falling under the responsibility of the Kanto Regional Police Bureau consisting of Saitama-
Ken, Ibaraki-Ken, Tochigi-Ken, Gunma-Ken, Chiba-Ken, Niigata-Ken, Nagano-Ken, Chuo
Expressway and the areas falling under the responsibility of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police
Department (Tokyo-To) except the Machida Police Station.
Operate—Operating a vehicle, aircraft, or vessels includes not only driving or guiding a vehicle
while it is in motion, either in person or through the agency of another, but also setting of its
motive power in action, or the manipulation of its controls so as to cause the particular vehicle to
move.
Parked and/or Standing—The vehicle is stationary, with or without the engine running, with or
without the operator at the controls. Parked and/or standing vehicles can be legally or illegally
parked. For the purpose of enforcement, there is no difference between parked and standing. No
vehicle will be left unattended with the engine running.
Passes to Foreign Nationals—Foreign nationals are not citizens or nationals of the United
States or Japan. Passes, temporary or permanent will not be issued to foreign nationals desiring
to conduct business on 5 AF installations until favorable local agency check has been completed
and applicants present proof of having legal resident status in ventures in Japan, or a valid alien
registration card. In questionable cases, applicants must obtain certification of legal residence
status from offices of the GOJ Bureau of Immigrations. Passes will not be issued past visa or
resident status expiration dates. The expiration dates will be clearly identified over stamping or
color coding the passes.
Passenger—Person within the vehicle other than the operator.
Pedestrian—Any person who is near or on a roadway using a sidewalk, roadway edge, parking
lot, pedestrian road crossing, driveway, or similar location.
Physical Control and Actual Physical Control—These terms are synonymous. They describe
the present capability and power to dominate, direct, or regulate the vehicle either in person or
through the agency of another, regardless of whether such vehicle is operated. For example, the
intoxicated person seated behind the steering wheel of a vehicle with the key in the vehicle in or
near the ignition but with the engine not turned on could be deemed in actual physical control of
the vehicle. However, the person asleep in the back seat with the keys in his or her pocket would
not be deemed in actual physical control. Physical control necessarily encompasses operation.
Reckless Driving—The operation of a vehicle is ―reckless‖ when it exhibits a culpable disregard
of foreseeable consequences to others from the act or omission involved. Recklessness is not
determined solely by reason of the happening of an injury, or the invasion of the rights of
another, nor by proof alone of excessive speed or erratic operation, but all of these factors may
be admissible and relevant as bearing upon the ultimate question; whether, under all the
circumstances, the manner of operation of the vehicle was of that heedless nature which made it

actually or imminently dangerous to occupants, or to the rights or safety of others. It is driving
with such a high degree of negligence that if death were caused, the accused would have
committed involuntary manslaughter, at least. The condition of the surface on which the vehicle
is operated, the time of day or night, the traffic and the condition of the vehicle are often matters
of importance in the proof of an offense.
Revocation—Loss of driving privileges for more than 6 months.
Roadway—A portion of a highway improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel,
exclusive of the sidewalk, berm, or shoulder even though persons riding bicycles, or other human
powered vehicles use such sidewalk, berm, or shoulder. A highway typically includes two or
more separate roadways. The term ―roadway‖ as used herein, shall refer to any such roadway
separately, but not to all such roadways collectively. Roadway lanes are identified from the curb
to centerline.
Road Rage—A deliberate attempt to harm other persons or property arising from an incident
involving use of a motor vehicle. This is a criminal matter and thus will not be addressed further.
Skaters—Individual operating roller skates, roller blades, skateboard and T-handled boards and
scooters. Motorized scooters (gas or electric powered) aren’t authorized on Yokota AB property.
Sobriety Checkpoints—Sobriety checkpoints are based on crime trend and traffic enforcement
analysis, and are designed to protect the readiness, health and welfare of the installation. 374 SFS
personnel, as augmented by 374 AW units, conduct checks.
Suspension—Loss of driving privileges for 6 months or less.
U—turn—Turning a vehicle on a roadway so as to go in the opposite direction whether done by
one continuous move or not.
Vehicle—Every device in, upon, or by which any person or property is or may be transported or
drawn upon a highway, excepting devices moved by human power or used exclusively upon
stationary rails or tracks.
Wing Traffic Review Officer (WTRO)—The 374 MSG/CD or in his or her absence, the 374
MSG/CC has been designated as the WTRO by the 374 AW/CC.

                            OFF-BASE TICKETING AND FINES

A13.1. The off-base traffic violation ticketing/fine system in Japan is a procedure under which
certain traffic violations are exempt from criminal prosecution. However, these violations still
incur a ―fine‖ that must be paid in order for the violator to avoid criminal prosecution. Further
guidance regarding this process is as follows:
   A13.1.1. Traffic fines can be paid at a Japanese post office or at a Bank of Japan. Payment
   cannot be made directly to the Japanese police issuing the ticket. Paying a fine can be
   accomplished by two different methods:
A13.2. Most fines must be paid within 7 days of receiving the citation. An additional day is
added if the seventh day falls on a Sunday or a Japanese holiday. This system is called,
―Provisional payment.‖ if you are authorized to use this method, you are not required to report to
a police station.
   A13.2.1. In some cases, you may be required to report to a senior police official at the police
   station designated on your citation within 10 days if a specific date to report is not listed on
   your citation.
A13.3. Regardless of who was operating your vehicle the registered owner is liable for paying
any Parking fees; the excuses you loaned the vehicle to a friend will not be accepted, you, the
registered owner must pay the fine.
A13.4. If you do not report to the police station as requested, or choose to pay your fine as
outlined above, a notification will be mailed to the 35 SFS Reports and Analysis section, who
will contact you and your Unit 1st Sgt to arrange for you to make payment of the fine by a set
suspense date
A13.5. If you receive a ticket--do not ignore or discard it! If you do not understand the citation,
or disagree with the citation; visit the 35 SFS Reports and Analysis section for further guidance.
A13.6. If you fail to pay a traffic fine, within 50 Days of notice you driving privileges will be
suspended for 6 months, you are also subject to criminal prosecution under the Japanese judicial
system.

                         FACTS ON CAR INSURANCE IN JAPAN

A14.1. This attachment explains what JCI is and why US Forces personnel are required to carry
additional coverage for POV and OV-plated vehicles. US Forces personnel are reminded not to
assume their US carrier insurance is valid or recognized in Japan. Contact your personal
insurance agent to find out the facts and seek legal advice if you need help in deciding what
commercial insurance coverage to purchase.
   A14.1.1. What is JCI? Japanese Compulsory Insurance (JCI) is mandatory basic-level
   insurance for motor vehicles operated in Japan. The insurance provides for liability costs
   associated with causing bodily injury or death to another person. JCI coverage applies to
   passengers in your vehicle, pedestrians and passengers of other vehicles.
A14.2. In cases of personal injury, JCI pays for treatment, consolation money and other costs up
to a maximum of ¥1,200,000 for each person you injure in one accident. If you injure several
people in one accident, JCI will pay up to ¥1,200,000 of medical expenses for each person you
injure.
   A14.2.1. In cases of death, JCI will pay up to ¥30,000,000 for each death you cause in an
   accident. If in one accident you kill several people, JCI will pay up to ¥30,000,000 on each
   death. If in an accident you cause physical handicap to several people, JCI will pay up to
   ¥30,000,000 for each physical handicap you cause.
A14.3. Why do I have to buy JCI? Article 5 of the Automobile Liability Security Law of Japan
requires JCI. Under this law, no automobile may be driven until its owner shows proof of the
compulsory insurance. This law is very similar to many of the compulsory insurance laws in the
US. As already stated in this instruction, US Forces must abide by Japanese laws for motor
vehicles.
A14.4. What is not covered by basic-level JCI? JCI does not protect you in the case of property
damage caused by you or any other expense exceeding those listed in USFJI 31-205.
A14.5. Who pays for personal injury or death damage over and above JCI coverage? This
instruction makes it mandatory for you to purchase personal injury coverage of $300,000 or
¥30,000,000 and property damage liability coverage of at least $30,000 or ¥3,000,000 in addition
to what JCI will cover.
   A14.5.1. If you cause injury, death or damage exceeding your JCI policy coverage and your
   private insurance coverage, you are responsible for the difference. JCI protects you only in
   case you injure or cause death to other people by the use of your vehicle.
   A14.5.2. JCI does not cover liability for any property you might damage by the use of your
   vehicle. If in an accident caused by you there is damage to someone’s vehicle, fence, house,
   storefront, or other property, you must have property damage liability coverage to protect
   you. A14.5.3. To put things in perspective, $30,000 or ¥3,000,000 may be less than the
   value of a single automobile. As to the question of who pays for personal injury damages in
   excess of JCI coverage, consider the following examples: A commercial insurance company
   in Japan was required to pay for its policy holder ¥70,000,000 in the case of an injury to a 3-
   year-old boy by a car. Another judgment in the amount of ¥120,000,000 was made in the
 68                                                                  35FWI31-204 28 MAY 2010


   case of a man killed in a car accident. JCI would not have come close to covering those
   judgments. Commercial insurance companies in Japan recommend we buy, in addition to
   JCI, ¥50,000,000 coverage for each person injured or killed in an accident.
Many local nationals purchase ¥100,000,000 personal injury and death liability insurance in
addition to and above their JCI coverage. You are encouraged to carefully consider purchasing
additional insurance over and above the JCI and USFJ requirements.
A14.6. Is my family covered if I have only JCI protection? No, JCI provides bodily and death
coverage with limits as set out above and is written "on the car." Your family will be covered
under the JCI coverage you have on your vehicle for personal or death damages only. There is no
property damage liability coverage under JCI.
   A14.6.1. There have been instances in Japan of DoD personnel assuming their family
   members were automatically covered as operators by their commercial insurance policy, and
   then finding out the policy only covers drivers of a specific age. There are four types of
   policies available for purchase in Japan: One has no coverage for people under 21 years of
   age, second has no coverage for people under age 26, third has no age limitation and fourth
   covers drivers by name only and no one else. You should be very careful when purchasing
   property or personal injury damage insurance. Specifically determine who is covered in the
   event of loss before anyone operates the motor vehicle.
A14.7. Does JCI cover property damages my family or I may cause? No. JCI does not cover
any property damages you or your family may cause in an accident. You have to get protection
from a commercial insurance company for such damages. This is why this instruction requires
you buy $30,000 or ¥3,000,000 of property damage liability coverage before you can register
and keep a two or four-wheeled motor vehicle on a USFJ installation.
A14.8. If my car is damaged by a hit-and-run driver or someone who won't pay or who says he
or she can't pay, then who pays? In these circumstances, there are three different courses of
action you may take:
   A14.8.1. You can pay for the damages yourself out of your pocket.
   A14.8.2. You can hire a Japanese lawyer and take your case to Japanese court.
   A14.8.3. You can make a claim against your collision insurance coverage on your car if you
   carry such insurance. Don’t confuse collision coverage, which is usually carried by people
   owning new and expensive cars, with property damage liability coverage. Property damage
   liability coverage will pay for somebody else’s property you destroy or damage. For you to
   be paid for your car, you must have collision coverage for your insurance to cover your car
   damage.
A14.9. Should I buy and carry collision and comprehensive coverage on my car? Collision
insurance is what covers repairs to your car in case of an accident. If the other person is at fault,
his or her property damage coverage should take care of repairing your car. If you are at fault,
you need collision coverage to repair your car. Comprehensive coverage is for things such as
fire, theft, or breakage of a windshield. To keep premiums down, both coverage are usually
bought with a deductible; that is, you pay the first $50-$500 of such damage. For advice on
additional coverage, consult a legal representative or insurance professional.

A14.10. Suppose I'm driving while intoxicated or guilty of reckless driving and with my car
cause property damage to another car and I have no property damage insurance or money. What
will happen to me? You may be criminally prosecuted in Japanese court for DWI or reckless
driving. If the accident occurs on base, or if the Japanese waive jurisdiction to the US, you could
face non-judicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, or even courts martial as applicable. You
will also likely lose your on-base driving privileges. Further, your misconduct, whether
prosecuted by the Japanese or branch of service, could constitute grounds for administrative
discharge. In any event, you will be responsible for paying for the property damage you cause.
A14.11. Japan, like many other Asian countries, has customs, which determine what will be
expected from you if you cause, or are even involved in, an accident, which results in injuries or
damage. Japanese people usually make a swift payment of several hundred dollars to express
their regret under such circumstances. Failure to do so may be taken as an insult and affect
subsequent negotiation over civil liability. The proper behavior is even more important because
people involved in car accidents causing personal injuries can be charged with Professional
Negligence under the Japanese Criminal Code, fined up to ¥500,000 or jailed for up to 5 years
forced labor. Therefore, it is in your best interest to contact your insurance agent immediately
following any accident, so that he or she may advise you on these matters. The base legal office
can also provide assistance in this area.
