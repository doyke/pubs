1. General
 2                                                  DOVERAFBI40-303 20 DECEMBER 2012


     1.1. This instruction pertains to individual family responsibilities for the care and
     supervision of their children. This instruction establishes age specific guidance to assist
     families in identifying what is considered appropriate supervision and lack of supervision,
     outlined in the Child and Youth Supervision Guidelines, Attachment 2. The ages indicated in
     this regulation are minimum ages. When using the guidelines contained within this
     regulation parents must assess their child’s maturity to determine when their child may be
     left unattended or requires supervision. Children unable to consistently demonstrate age
     appropriate behavior should not be given the same degree of self-management
     responsibilities as those who do.
2. Terms Defined
     2.1. Appropriate Supervision: Guidance by an adult which meets basic needs and protects a
     child on a temporary or permanent basis. The child must be able to contact the adult and
     understand emergency procedures.
     2.2. Lack of Supervision: A form of child neglect where egregious absence or inattention
     deprives a child of needed age-appropriate care.
     2.3. Availability of Parent or Responsible Adult/Caretaker: When children are left without a
     caregiver in quarters, the parents (or responsible adult/caretakers) are responsible for
     informing children of their location, and the time when parent or adult/caretaker will return
     to the location of the child. Children should have emergency telephone numbers, knowledge
     of emergency procedures, and ability to access their parent or designated responsible adult.
     2.4. Immediate Access: Parent or adult/caretaker in charge has visibility of the child or the
     child is within hearing distance.
3. Responsibilities
     3.1. All agencies, departments, or individuals affiliated with DAFB will immediately report
     all concerns, suspicions, or incidents of lack of child supervision to 436th Security Forces
     Squadron Law Enforcement Desk at (302) 677-6664.
     3.2. 436th Security Forces Squadron is responsible for immediate response to the scene
     where a child is without appropriate supervision. Security Forces will ensure the child’s
     safety. Security Forces will attempt to locate the child’s sponsor or other responsible adult.
     In all incidents of alleged child abuse/neglect, Security Forces will notify the sponsor’s unit
     and the Family Advocacy Officer at (302) 677-2711.
     3.3. Family Advocacy Program. Upon receipt of an allegation of lack of supervision,
     Family Advocacy will assess individual cases for neglect and make referrals to appropriate
     agencies. Cases of alleged child neglect will be referred to the Department of Services for
     Children, Youth and their Families, Division of Family Services, and the Central Registry
     Board to determine if the incident meets the Air Force criteria for family maltreatment.
     Family Advocacy will coordinate all individual services, treatment, and educational
     resources when a case meets criteria for maltreatment.
