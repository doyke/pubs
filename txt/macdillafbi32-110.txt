        tory furniture and equipment. All furnishings issued at the time of room assignment will remain in
        the resident’s room. Residents are not to dismantle, unbolt, or relocate furniture/fixtures/appli-

     have orders prepared.
     2.20.9. Military-to-Military Marriages. When a dormitory resident marries another military member
     stationed within a one hour commute of MacDill, both members will be authorized BAH and may
     move off base when proof of marriage is provided to the dormitory manager. When a dormitory resi-
     dent is married and the spouse is in a geographically separated location, a move off base with BAH
     will be authorized after the spouse’s organization approves and verifies the dorm resident has separa-
     tion, joint-spouse, PCS, or retirement orders. A copy of these orders must be provided to the housing
     office or dormitory manager prior to BAH authorization. If the geographically separated spouse will
     not be separated or assigned to MacDill, then the MacDill dormitory resident can remain in the dormi-
     tory as a Space Required resident.

2.21. Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) Policy.
   2.21.1. E-4s with more than three years time in service are authorized to reside off base at Without
   Dependent Rate BAH at any time the unaccompanied housing office receives verification of Time in
   Service dates from the organizational commander/first sergeant. A written waiver request must be
   submitted to the Base Housing office to stay in the dormitory longer than 30 days after promotion.
   E-5s will not be allowed to reside in the dormitory longer than 30 days after promotion. (E-4s with
   less than 3 years time in service are considered Space Required.)
   2.21.2. To be placed on the BAH waiting list, the dormitory resident must request approval through
   their organizational commander/first sergeant. A standard form letter is attached for use (see Attach-
   ment 9). Residents desiring to be placed on the list must submit the indorsed form to 6 CES/CEH no
   later than close of business on the last business day of each month.
   2.21.3. When the overall base dormitory occupancy rate exceeds 90 percent, dorm residents can place
   their names on the BAH waiting list according to grade and effective date of rank (DOR). 6 CES/CEH
   will release a BAH approval letter monthly. Each selection list will be sent to organizational com-
   manders/first sergeants for final approval prior to public release. The total number of personnel
   selected will be determined by 6 CES/CEH monthly using the percentages based on Priority 1 & 2 res-
   idents. Organizations may decide to remove a selected individual prior to the list being made public.
   If an individual is removed from the list, the next person on the list will move up and approval will be
   obtained from their organization. Applications will be accepted by 6 CES/CEH until close of business
   on the last normal business day of each month, regardless of the date it was signed by the organiza-
   tion’s approving authority. Once a list is closed out, all new applications received will be considered
   for the next month’s selection list. Residents should move off base within 30 days of notification (see
   Attachment 2 and Attachment 3 for the out-processing checklists).
   2.21.4. Dormitory residents are required to provide changes in rank to dormitory managers to ensure
   their status and placement on the waiting list are correct. Residents who are selected for BAH will not
   be denied BAH due to deployments, emergency leaves, and any other scheduled actions, as long as
   organizational commanders/first sergeants are informed. Selected residents will remain housed and
   retain the option to move until they are ready to move, i.e., leave terminates, return to MacDill from
   deployment, etc. However, substitutions to the selection list will not be made unless a selected resi-
   dent is removed by his/her organization. If an individual is removed from the selection list by his or
   her organizational leaders, he or she must reaccomplish the form at Attachment 7 and obtain an
   indorsement again from his or her organization’s commander before being placed on the BAH waiting
   list. Any resident may request to have his or her name removed at any time with no penalty.
   2.21.5. Individuals may elect a paid local move or DITY move. Dormitory residents must contact 6
   CES/CEH for orders prior to moving.

2.22. Storage.
   2.22.1. Priority 1 and 2 dormitory residents are responsible for contacting 6 CES/CEH within 30 days
   of dormitory room assignment to arrange for permanent NON-TEMPORARY government storage of
   personal items that will not fit in rooms. These items will remain in storage until termination of room
   assignment. After the resident terminates the room, the storage items must be removed. It is the dor-
   mitory resident’s responsibility to request release of stored items. Failure to do so may result in the
   resident being charged storage costs beyond government quarters occupancy period.

     2.22.2. Dormitory managers will issue storage room keys when requested by residents. Residents
     must read the storage room policy letter and sign for storage room key to gain access. All items placed
     in these area must be secured in assigned lockers and clearly labeled with the member’s name, room
     number, unit, phone number, and duty location. All items must be stored in assigned storage units
     unless authorized otherwise by dormitory managers. Items left unsecured will be donated to the Thrift
     Store, Airmen’s Attic, or be disposed of. Dormitory managers will make every attempt to locate the
     property owner within the initial 45-day waiting period before disposition action occurs. Once the
     45-day period ends, dormitory managers may use their discretion to dispose of property to non-profit
     organizations or waste disposal. No parts or flammables are to be stored in the rooms or storage
     rooms.

2.23. Antennas.
     2.23.1. Citizen Band (CB), Short Wave Radio, satellite dishes, and TV antennas will not be installed
     on dormitory buildings. Unauthorized antennas will be removed and damages caused by attaching
     them to the building will be repaired at the occupant's expense.
     2.23.2. Some buildings have centralized antenna systems in the rooms. The same wall receptacle used
     for cable TV may be configured for access to broadcast television through the building’s central
     antenna. For those buildings, contact the dormitory manager to be switched to the central antenna.

2.24. Dormitory Moves Based on Unit Integrity. If a dormitory resident is originally assigned to a
room in a different building than their unit’s dormitory due to limited space, the dormitory manager may
move the resident at a later time to ensure unit integrity. These moves are paid for by the government and
include telephone and/or cable reconnection fees.

                         QUARTERS IMPROVEMENT COMMITTEE (QIC)

4.1. Objectives and Standards.
     4.1.1. The objective of the MacDill AFB Quarters Improvement Committee (QIC) is to provide the
     optimum resources necessary to provide the finest facilities and maintain the highest standards of liv-
     ing for unaccompanied enlisted personnel occupying the dormitories. Providing outstanding facilities
     for professional people is the goal of the QIC and displaying aesthetically pleasing décor and quality
     furnishings consistent with the highest standards available from commercial sources.
     4.1.2. The QIC establishes minimum acceptable standards for MacDill AFB dormitories. It also lays
     the groundwork for planning improvements for overall dormitory facilities. These planning improve-
     ments are known as the Quarters Improvement Plan (QIP). The QIC will strive for quality living con-
     ditions by monitoring facility modifications, furnishing upgrades, renovations, and new construction
     projects.
     4.1.3. Specifically, the goals of the MacDill QIC are to provide all personnel with the best living con-
     ditions possible and to promote pride, professionalism, and personal dignity in living accommoda-
     tions. Providing professional living quarters facilitates the increased readiness posture, morale, and
     productivity of our forces, promotes retention, and helps reenlistment rates. It further decreases
     long-range maintenance costs associated with dormitory maintenance by pride in ownership.

     REQUEST TO RESIDE OFF BASE WITH ALLOWANCES PRIOR TO MARRIAGE

MEMORANDUM FOR 6 CES/CEHU


FROM: _______________________________
      (Rank/Name of Unaccompanied Member)


SUBJECT: Request to Reside Off base with Allowances 30 days Prior to Marriage


1. I am requesting to reside off base with allowances prior to marriage to establish a household in the
local area. My planned marriage date is _________________. I understand that this move will be at
government expense. I also understand that if I desire assistance in moving, I must contact the
Unaccompanied Housing Manager’s office to arrange for orders to be prepared. I am aware that upon
leaving the dormitory, I must request the release of any NON-TEMPORARY storage items. If I fail to
request the release of these items, I may be responsible for any storage fees incurred after I move out of
the dormitory. I am also aware that my telephone and cable reconnection fees will not be reimbursed for
this move.
2. I have provided my Commander/First Sergeant a copy of my marriage license as proof of my
intentions to marry. I also understand that my Commander/First Sergeant must indorse this letter to show
good faith. I am aware that my Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) will not be started until I clear my
dormitory room through my dormitory manager. My BAH will be at the Without Dependent Rate. I also
understand that once I am married I must go to Accounting & Finance to initiate BAH at the With
Dependent Rate (unless I am married to another military member).
3. In accordance with AFI 32-6005, I understand that if my marriage fails to occur, I may be
involuntarily assigned back to the dormitory. I also understand that if my marriage fails to occur and I
have already entered a lease, I have been instructed to report to the Unaccompanied Housing Manager
forty-five (45) days prior to the expiration of my lease for reassignment to the dormitory.

move. I also understand that I am responsible to request the release of any NON-TEMPORARY storage
items and that failure to do so may result in my being held financially responsible for storage costs after
I terminate my dorm room.
