                                            Chapter 1

                                            PURPOSE

1.1. Crew Standardization/Evaluation Program. The purpose of this instruction is to
establish responsibilities, policies and procedures applicable to all ground radar C2 units. The
remaining unit instructions contain detailed procedures and criteria for the evaluation of
individuals assigned operations duties by specific systems.
     1.1.1. This instruction sets up the HQ ACC/PACAF/USAFE Ground C2 Systems
     Standardization and Evaluation (Stan/Eval) Program. It establishes the applicability,
     objectives, organization and responsibilities of the program and lists administrative
     procedures.
     1.1.2. The provisions of this instruction apply to commanders, operations supervisors, and
     operations crewmembers assigned or attached to all ground radar C2 units in Air Combat
     Command (ACC), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), United States Air Forces in Europe
     (USAFE) and Air National Guard (ANG).
1.2. Accessibility, Releasibility and Applicability. Publications and forms are available for
downloading or ordering on the e-Publishing website at www.e-publishing.af.mil/. There are no
releasibility restrictions on this publication. This instruction applies to all ground radar units
assigned to or gained by the MAJCOMs. The Theater Air Control System (TACS) organization
covered by this instruction is the Control and Reporting Center (CRC). This AFI provides
guidance for First Air Force (Air Forces Northern) and subordinate units. This instruction also
applies to the stan/eval programs for the 53d Wing, 552d Air Control Group (ACG), 57th
Operations Group (OG), 99th Range Squadron (RS), 414th Combat Training Squadron (CTS),
133d Test Squadron (TS), 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES), USAF Weapons School
(USAFWS), ACC/PACAF units to include: 610th Air Control Flight (ACF) (Japan), 621st Air
Control Squadron (ACS) (Korea), 623d Air Control Flight (Japan), 13 AF Det (Japan), 169th
Aerospace Control and Warning Squadron (HIRAOC) and 176th Air Control Squadron
(AKRAOC), 266th Range Squadron (RANS), and 81st Range Control Squadron. This instruction
does not apply to Air Education Training Command (AETC) but may be used by AETC Units as
reference. Publication, implementation and review of this instruction must be consistent with
MAJCOM training directives.
     1.2.1. ACG and OG will be referred to as Group throughout this AFI.
     1.2.2. Air Defense Sector (ADS) Director of Operations (ADS/DO) will serve as the group-
     level authority for the ADS units.
     1.2.3. (Added-NELLISAFB) Accessibility, Releasability and Applicability. 57 WG/WGV
     is the office of primary responsibility for 57th Wing stan/eval programs. Due to the diversity
     of the 57th Wing, the 57th Wing Commander has oversight/responsibility of stan/eval
     functions. All references to the OG/OGV will be replaced with 57 WG/WGV for purpose of
     stan/eval oversight for 57 WG units.
1.3. Objectives. Specific program objectives are to:
AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                                 7


   1.3.1. Provide a system to assess and document individual crew proficiency and capability to
   accomplish assigned C2 duties.
   1.3.2. Develop and ensure standardization of operational procedures for weapon system
   employment.
   1.3.3. Ensure compliance with appropriate operational, training, and administrative
   directives.
   1.3.4. Evaluate and revise operational directives, procedures, and techniques as required.
   1.3.5. Assess unit effectiveness and compliance with operational directives and procedures.
   1.3.6. Recognize trends and recommend/initiate changes to training programs and directives.
1.4. Transfers.
   1.4.1. Upon permanent change of station, individuals transferring from a unit that did not
   possess like equipment will receive an Initial (INIT) Qualification (QUAL) and/or Mission
   Qualification (MSN). Personnel transferring, either PCS or TDY, from one like system to
   another (i.e., Modular Control System (MCS) to MCS) may be continued in their previous
   training phase/qualification/certification, following local orientation and selected training, if
   applicable. However, prior to performing operations duties unsupervised at a new unit, they
   must meet the following requirements:
       1.4.1.1. Satisfactorily complete training requirements directed by the gaining MAJCOM
       or unit DO.
       1.4.1.2. Have their existing qualification validated by the final approving officer to

   2.5.1. NAF (PACAF Group) stan/eval personnel will conduct formal stan/eval visits to
   subordinate units in order to determine the effectiveness of unit stan/eval programs and
   individual/crew proficiency. The MAJCOM supplement to this AFI specifies frequency of
   visits.
   2.5.2. Stan/eval personnel will review the previous visit report prior to arrival. Repeat
   deficiencies identified during the formal stan/eval visit may be indicative of inadequate
   management practices, and such repeats should be weighed in the overall unit rating.
   2.5.3. During formal visits, stan/eval personnel will assess the unit's compliance with
   command policy and guidance. They will identify areas of inadequate guidance to the
   appropriate headquarters staff agency for resolution. They will not use system deficiencies or
   maintenance problems that limit the operations section to determine unit ratings for the
   operations sections.
   2.5.4. The emphasis during a formal stan/eval visit will be to:
      2.5.4.1. Assess the capability of the unit examiners to evaluate operations crewmembers.
      2.5.4.2. Assess operations crew capability to perform the unit’s assigned mission. Assess
      this with written and positional evaluations (SPOT, INIT, QUAL, etc.)

      paragraph 2.8.
      2.5.4.6. Identify factors limiting the capability of operations personnel to accomplish
      assigned missions and recommend corrective action as required.
2.6. Formal Stan/Eval Visit Notification Procedures.
   2.6.1. The stan/eval office initiating the visit will send a notification letter to the parent
   group/squadron and unit with an information copy to the MAJCOM to arrive not later than
   (NLT) 60 days before the visit. For ANG visits, notifications will also be sent to the State
   Adjutant General and NGB/A3. Within PACAF, notification to visit Hawaii ANG units will
   be sent to 154 OSF/DOCV. The intent of this letter is to establish the dates of the visit and
   inform the unit of the scope of the evaluation.
   2.6.2. As a minimum, the notification letter will include the following information:
      2.6.2.1. Name, rank, social security number, security clearance, and evaluation area of
      each team member.
      2.6.2.2. Planned visit dates.
      2.6.2.3. Number and types of live/simulation evaluations to be scheduled, to include
      crew evaluation procedures. An alternative is to provide a percentage of evaluations by

       2.6.2.5. Support required (billeting, transportation, administrative office space, etc.)
2.7. Rating Criteria and Procedures. Use the rating criteria and procedures to assign overall,
area, and subarea ratings during the formal stan/eval visit. Two systems of rating criteria are used
for subareas rated during the formal stan/eval visit: the five-tier and compliance system.
   2.7.1. Five-Tier Rating System.
       2.7.1.1. Rate areas evaluated using the following guidelines:
           2.7.1.1.1. OUTSTANDING. Performance and procedures in effect are error free and
           far exceed all requirements. Program serves as a model which others should emulate.
           2.7.1.1.2. EXCELLENT. Performance and procedures in effect exceed requirements
           and enhance overall effectiveness.
           2.7.1.1.3. SATISFACTORY. Performance and procedures meet mission
           requirements. Procedures and activities are carried out in an effective and competent
           manner. Resources and programs are efficiently managed. Minor deficiencies may
           exist; however, they do not impede or limit mission accomplishment.
           2.7.1.1.4. MARGINAL. Most requirements are met, but not in full compliance with
           directives. Deviations degrade the effectiveness of the program.
           2.7.1.1.5. UNSATISFACTORY. Deviation or omissions cause the function
           evaluated to be ineffective. Clearly lacks compliance with appropriate directives.
       2.7.1.2. Areas rated using this system consist of operations performance, stan/eval
       programs, operations publications, and additional programs where guidance is provided
       and effective management and initiative can be used to produce more effective results.
       2.7.1.3. Areas rated using the five-tier system are evaluated for compliance with
       established procedures and requirements, management procedures, and the degree to
       which desired objectives are attained.
   2.7.2. Compliance Rating System.
       2.7.2.1. Rating criteria is limited to compliance or non-compliance
       2.7.2.2. Evaluate MAJCOM/NAF/group/unit operations-related SIIs during formal visits.
       Compliance will be reflected in all ratings and evaluations, and will be commented on
       separately in formal visit reports.
   2.7.3. In all cases, the team chief will assess ratings maintaining the maximum degree of
   objectivity possible.
   2.7.4. The team chief will assign an ―Overall Unit Rating‖ (five-tier) by combining ratings
   from operations performance, stan/eval programs, operations publications, and additional
   programs and compliance with SIIs.
   2.7.5. Assign a five-tier rating to each of the major areas including operations performance,
   stan/eval programs, and operations publications. This rating will be an overall assessment of
   the major area based on subarea ratings. In addition, each subarea will be given a rating.
 16                      AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


   2.7.6. Rate academic testing on the average of overall test results based on the guidelines in
   Attachment 8. Do not assign ratings for each crew position.
   2.7.7. Give each additional program evaluated a five-tier rating.
   2.7.8. Disposition of formal visit findings is to be provided to HHQ within 6 months.
2.8. Formal Visit Evaluation Areas. Although MAJCOMs may specify additional areas of
emphasis in their chapter, the formal stan/eval visits will concentrate on the following main
areas:
   2.8.1. Operations Performance (Overall Five-Tier Rating).
       2.8.1.1. Individual Positional Evaluations (five-tier). This is based on the performance of
       individual crewmembers during individual positional evaluations.
       2.8.1.2. Crew Performance (five-tier). This is based on the performance of Air Defense
       unit crew/operations section during an exercise scenario and/or during live/DMO and/or
       simulation activity.

   primary duty position if within the eligibility window. Other unit examiners may receive
   positional SPOT evaluations.
   2.9.4. Perform positional evaluations of a representative sample of crewmembers. Make
   every effort to evaluate a cross section of supervisors and experienced/inexperienced
   individuals. Document each positional evaluation on AF Form 8. These evaluations may be
   noted as SPOT evaluations.
   2.9.5. Individuals who are multi-qualified may be subject to positional evaluations in each
   crew position.
   2.9.6. Unit examiners will administer positional evaluations while receiving an objectivity
   evaluation from a higher headquarters examiner. The individual’s qualification evaluation
   scenario will be selected, briefed and coordinated by the unit examiner. The examinee will
   perform all mission planning. This constitutes an evaluation of the unit examinee, the unit
   examiner's objectivity, and the unit's positional evaluation procedures and profiles. When an
   objectivity evaluation is conducted, include both the evaluation of the unit examiner and the
   evaluation of the unit examinee in the visit results.
   2.9.7. Administer positional evaluations to individuals by notifying the unit DO immediately
   prior to the mission briefing (if the individual is already scheduled to work on position) or by
   requesting an individual be added to the next day's schedule for this purpose.
   2.9.8. Crew performance evaluation (ADS only) procedures are:
      2.9.8.1. The team chief will consolidate team member inputs and rate crew performance

      to study and complete the re-examination. A minimum of 24 hours must elapse before
      administering a re-examination to allow for an adequate period to study. Failure of the re-
      examination will result in:
          2.10.2.3.1. A loss of qualification
          2.10.2.3.2. The examiner completing the AF Form 8 will document the failure IAW
          Chapter 7 and the AF Form 4141/Learning History within the LMS.

                                          Chapter 5

                                      EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Crew Stan/Eval Program utilizes two types of evaluations to ensure
qualification of crewmembers and standardization of operations. Crew qualification evaluations
are administered periodically and documented on the AF Form 8 to ensure crew qualification.
Supplementary evaluations are unstructured tools to be used by the commander to ensure
standardization of battle management C2 and other operations. NOTE: Unstructured means the
evaluations are not periodic, do not have an expiration date, and do not cover standard areas.
5.2. Qualification Evaluations. Qualification evaluations consist of two structured phases,
academic and positional. Each phase requires the completion of requisite tasks. The academic
phase, when required, includes a series of examinations. The positional phase includes a
live/DMO and/or simulated event evaluation of the individual crewmember performance.
   5.2.1. Qualification Evaluation Categories. There are three types of qualification
   evaluations. Periodic qualification evaluations are administered to ensure basic qualification
   in the MDS and crew position of a crewmember (QUAL), and qualification to employ the
   MDS of the crewmember in accomplishing the unit’s operational mission (MSN). Evaluation
   and certification of specific crew performance may also be accomplished (SPOT). Individual
   will complete the following types of crew evaluations as appropriate:
       5.2.1.1. QUAL Evaluations. All crewmembers will complete a periodic QUAL
       evaluation in their primary assigned MDS, to include requisites, as specified in the
       applicable AFI 13-1 MDS-Specific Volume 2. Initial QUAL Evaluations will be
       designated INIT QUAL. Recurring Evaluations will be designated QUAL/MSN in
       conjunction with the completion of the MSN portion of the examination. See flow chart
       at Attachment 13.
       5.2.1.2. MSN Evaluations. All crewmembers maintaining CMR crew status will
       complete a MSN evaluation in their primary assigned MDS, to include requisites, as
       specified in the applicable AFI 13-1 MDS-Specific Volume 2. The MSN evaluation
       should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required in the performance of normal
       operational and training events. The requirement for a MSN evaluation may be waived
       for those MDS’s where performance of normal operational, test and training events
       involve tasks covered during the accomplishment of a QUAL evaluation as specified in
       AFI 13-1MDS-Specific Volume 2. Initial MSN Evaluations will be designated INIT
       MSN. Recurring Evaluations will consist of a QUAL/MSN in conjunction with the
       completion of the QUAL portion of the examination. See flow chart at Attachment 13.
       5.2.1.3. SPOT Evaluations – Positional or Academic (Optional). A SPOT evaluation
       is an evaluation not intended to satisfy the requirements of a periodic evaluation (e.g.,
       QUAL/MSN). SPOT evaluations have no specific requisites or requirements, unless
       specified in MAJCOM supplements. An evaluation that begins as a SPOT evaluation
       may become (and be documented as) a required periodic evaluation if all required
       positional phase requirements are completed during the SPOT eval and the examinee
       subsequently completes all academic phase requirements for the evaluation within the
       periods described in paragraph 5.2.7. Do not add on missions to complete the
 28                      AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


       requirements for a periodic evaluation unless the group/squadron commander concurs
       with the crewmember’s desire to realign the evaluation expiration date and approves the
       additional requirements. Evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1 - 5.2.1.3 will be
       documented as SPOT evaluations.
NOTE: When the examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not qualified to evaluate the
same crew position in the MDS of the examinee, the evaluation will not be credited towards a
periodic evaluation.
   5.2.2. Combined Qualification Evaluations. To promote efficient use of operational
   resources, accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practical. If combined, include the
   designation of each evaluation in the Positional Phase of the AF Form 8 (e.g., QUAL/MSN).
   Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM supplements.
   5.2.3. Qualification Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when
   applicable, to further describe the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1 - 5.2.1.3.
       5.2.3.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a crew position or instructor
       qualification in an MDS, (e.g., INIT QUAL, INIT MSN).
       5.2.3.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
       qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation, loss of currency, a
       positional recheck following a failed periodic evaluation, or loss of qualification due to a
       commander-directed downgrade. If a non-rated crewmember fails to make satisfactory
       progress during an evaluation, the crewmember may meet a Training Evaluation Board
       (TEB).
           5.2.3.2.1. When loss of qualification is for expiration of a required periodic
           evaluation, the evaluation given will be IAW the guidance for that periodic
           evaluation. The AF Form 8 Mission/Check description will be documented with an
           RQ prefix.
NOTE: When expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to complete one or
more of the academic phase requisites (see paragraph 5.2.4), the positional evaluation has
successfully been completed within the eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period
evaluation or within the period listed in paragraph 5.2.7.2 for an out-of-the-eligibility period
evaluation, and the Group/CC or ADS/DO and 154 OSF/CC determines that qualification will be
re-established by completion of the academic requisites without re-accomplishment of the
positional evaluation as outlined in paragraph 5.2.16, the AF Form 8 Mission/Check description
will not be documented with an RQ prefix.
           5.2.3.2.2. When loss of qualification is due to loss of currency, the evaluation profile
           will be as directed by the squadron commander and will include, as a minimum, those
           items for which the individual is non-current. The AF Form 8 Mission/Check
           description will be documented with RQ SPOT. See also AFI 13-1MDS, Volume 1,
           regarding loss of currency.
           5.2.3.2.3. When loss of qualification is for failure to pass an evaluation, the recheck
           evaluation will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.2.12. The AF Form 8
           Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT, as
           applicable.
AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                             29


         5.2.3.2.4. When loss of qualification is due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
         paragraph 7.4), the evaluation profile will be as directed by the commander. The AF
         Form 8 Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ
         SPOT, as applicable.
         5.2.3.2.5. Do not use RQ to prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
         qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
     5.2.3.3. No-Notice (N/N). A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified
     of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. The
     beginning of normal preparation for a mission will be determined by the examiner and
     may be defined in supplements to this instruction. The intent is to preclude extraordinary
     preparation for the mission.
         5.2.3.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
         daily crew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
             5.2.3.3.1.1. (Added-NELLISAFB) No-notice Evaluations. The annual no-
             notice rate is 15% of qualified ABM/WDs. Do not conduct IQE’s or re-
             evaluations as no-notice.
         5.2.3.3.2. An examinee may utilize a no-notice evaluation to update a QUAL/MSN
         evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the evaluation are completed
         within the periods described in paragraph 5.2.7. If all requirements were not
         completed on the first simulation or live fly event, subsequent simulations or live fly
         events are authorized to complete all required areas. If the examinee elects not to
         update a QUAL/MSN evaluation expiration date, the evaluation will be documented
         as a N/N SPOT evaluation.
     5.2.3.4. Simulated (SIM). An evaluation where the positional phase requisite is
     conducted during a simulated mission.
     5.2.3.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
     (e.g., N/N, SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
     evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes will be explained under Mission Description
     in the Examiner’s Remarks (see paragraphs 7.3.7.3).
  5.2.4. Academic Phase Requisites. The academic phase for periodic crew evaluations
  includes requisites listed below. See Chapter 6 of this instruction for additional guidance on
  crew examinations.
     5.2.4.1. QUAL Evaluations. Closed book examination.
     5.2.4.2. MSN Evaluations. As specified in AFI 13-1 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
  5.2.5. Positional Phase Requisites. The positional phase for crew evaluations include live
  and/or simulated event execution in the MDS or, if applicable, a suitable simulator profile
  that will allow evaluation of individual crew performance. The profile used to fulfill the
  positional phase requisite must incorporate all appropriate requirements set in the applicable
  AFI 13-1 MDS-Specific Volume 2, and allow accurate measure of the proficiency of the
  examinee. Evaluation profiles will reflect unit tasking, daily training missions, be realistic,
  and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission.

  5.2.6. Timing of Qualification Evaluations.
     5.2.6.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th
     month following the month in which the positional phase was successfully accomplished
     (e.g., a periodic evaluation in which the positional phase was completed on 9 Oct 04
     expires on 31 Mar 06). OBJ expiration date is determined by the unit commander.
     5.2.6.2. Scheduling. Schedule periodic evaluations in the eligibility period (six-month
     period prior to expiration date).
     5.2.6.3. Extended Evaluations. Periodic evaluations may be extended on a case-by-case
     basis according to the following criteria:
         5.2.6.3.1. Squadron Commander-Extended Evaluations. Squadron commanders may
         extend the expiration date of periodic evaluations up to three months for the reasons
         listed below.
             5.2.6.3.1.1. Individuals assigned PCS/PCA to a non-C2 assignment.
             5.2.6.3.1.2. Individuals departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another weapon
             system.
             5.2.6.3.1.3. Individuals undergoing unit system conversion.
             5.2.6.3.1.4. Individual removal from active C2 status (e.g., separation or
             retirement from the Service).
             5.2.6.3.1.5. Individuals participating in real world operations (to include
             operations other than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required
             evaluation(s) before or during deployment. This will be on a case-by-case basis
             and is not authority to grant blanket extensions for scheduled operational
             deployments.
         5.2.6.3.2. For flight commanders and above, the approval authority is the next
         commander in the member’s chain of command, with the concurrence of the
         member’s immediate supervisor, IAW the guidance provided in paragraph 5.2.6.3.1.
         For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, ACC/A3Y is the approval authority.
         5.2.6.3.3. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. MAJCOMs may authorize the extension of
         expiration dates of periodic crew qualification evaluations.
         5.2.6.3.4. Documentation. Document extensions with a memorandum for record
         (MFR) placed in Section II of the FEF specifying extension authority, the new
         expiration date, and include a brief description of the extension.
             5.2.6.3.4.1. Extension MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any
             affected periodic evaluation.
             5.2.6.3.4.2. File the MFR on top of the affected AF Form 8 in Section II of the
             FEF.
             5.2.6.3.4.3. Requisites not completed during original eligibility period must be
             completed prior to extended expiration date indicated on the MFR.
             5.2.6.3.4.4. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                                31


               AF Form 8 under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when
               action is complete and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become
               a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the
               MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8. Example: If an evaluation
               was extended based on an HHQ waiver, an MFR will remain in the FEF until
               such time as the next evaluation is completed. That waiver reference is
               commented on in para D of the Form 8.
       5.2.6.4. Requirements Before Permanent Change of Station/Temporary Duty. If a
       periodic evaluation will expire within three months after the proposed departure for a
       permanent change of station (PCS) to an assignment in the same MDS, or during an
       upcoming temporary duty (TDY), complete the required evaluation(s) before departing
       for either the PCS assignment or the TDY. Obtain a MAJCOM stan/eval waiver for
       unusual situations.
   5.2.7. Requisite Completion. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of
   combined evaluations as defined in AFI 13-1 MDS-Specific Volume 2. Requisites from a
   completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations provided they cover all
   required areas and are within the requisite zone for each evaluation. See also paragraph
   5.3.1. For individuals possessing multiple qualifications, the exam may count for separate
   evaluations provided the exam occurs for each evaluation IAW the provisions of paragraphs
   5.2.7.1 and 5.2.7.2. For all evaluations, accomplish requisites as follows:
       5.2.7.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in the
       eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the six-month eligibility period
       prior to the expiration date of the current evaluation period to update that expiration date.
       5.2.7.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations outside the eligibility
       period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period encompassing the
       month in which the positional evaluation was administered.
EXCEPTION: For extended evaluations, requisites may be completed between the beginning of
the six-month eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration
date.
       5.2.7.3. Recheck. For evaluations used to remedy only failed areas in a failed evaluation:
           5.2.7.3.1. Requisites that were graded ―Q‖ for a failed evaluation per paragraph
           5.2.7.1. or 5.2.7.2. remain graded ―Q‖, IAW paragraph 5.2.12.1. Recheck examines
           only the areas that were graded ―U‖ in the failed evaluation.
           5.2.7.3.2. Valid requisite completion dates from the ―Q-3‖ AF Form 8 will not be
           annotated on the recheck AF Form 8. The recheck AF Form 8 will only include
           documentation of the positional phase evaluation, unless requisites were not
           completed or are required to complete the recheck. If the positional recheck is
           completed prior to completion of required requisites, delay completion of the AF
           Form 8 until requisites are completed and enter the requisites on the recheck AF Form
           8.
   5.2.8. Alternate Means of Evaluation. When positional evaluation (live event) of a required
   area is not possible, the area may be evaluated verbally or in simulation. Examiners will
32                     AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


  make every effort to evaluate all required areas on-position during a live event before
  resorting to this option. See the appropriate AFI 13-1 MDS-Specific Volume 2, for areas
  prohibited from verbal/sim evaluation (if applicable).
  5.2.9. Grading System. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document crew
  performance. On one level, individual scores are recorded for examinations while
  areas/subareas of crew performance are individually graded against established evaluation
  criteria. Performance less than fully qualified is documented. On the second level, an overall
  qualification level is determined from the compilation of these individual scores/grades.
     5.2.9.1. Area/Subarea Grades. Areas/subareas will have a two-level (Q/U) or three-level
     (Q/Q-/U) grading system. Discrepancies will be documented against the listed subareas.
         5.2.9.1.1. ―Q‖ is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a
         satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed crew duties within the
         prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
         5.2.9.1.2. ―Q-‖ indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned
         area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the
         examiner. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed ―Q-‖
         tolerances or jeopardize flight safety.
         5.2.9.1.3. ―U‖ indicates performance outside allowable parameters or deviations
         from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely affected mission
         accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee receiving an
         area/subarea grade of ―U‖ normally requires additional training. When, in the
         judgment of the examiner, additional training will not constructively improve
         examinee’s performance, it is not required. In this case, the examiner must thoroughly
         debrief the examinee.
     5.2.9.2. Critical Area. The lead MAJCOM is responsible for the establishment of
     evaluation areas that, upon failure, would most adversely affect the qualification of a
     crewmember. Critical areas may include, but are not limited to, Crew Coordination and
     Safety. Grade all critical areas as either Qualified (Q) or Unqualified (U).
     5.2.9.3. Qualification Levels. Overall evaluation performance is graded by qualification
     levels as follows:
         5.2.9.3.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The crewmember demonstrated desired
         performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within
         tolerances specified in the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no
         discrepancies were noted, and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
             5.2.9.3.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no ―U‖ grades being given in any
             area(s)/subarea(s).
             5.2.9.3.1.2. In the judgment of the examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
             awarding of an overall ―Q-1‖.
             5.2.9.3.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the
             debriefing of that evaluation.
AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                          33


         5.2.9.3.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The crewmember demonstrated the ability to
         perform duties safely, but:
             5.2.9.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training
             was assigned.
             5.2.9.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of ―U‖ was awarded.
             5.2.9.3.2.3. In the judgment of the examiner, there is justification based on
             performance in one or several areas/subareas.
         5.2.9.3.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The crewmember demonstrated an
         unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge.
             5.2.9.3.3.1. An area grade of ―U‖ awarded in a critical area requires an overall
             ―Q-3‖ for the evaluation.
             5.2.9.3.3.2. An overall ―Q-3‖ can be awarded if, in the judgment of the examiner,
             there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/subareas.
     5.2.9.4. Written, Computer Based, or Electronic Examinations. Grade written, computer
     based, or electronic examinations as a percentage of correct answers. See paragraph
     6.4.3.1 for minimum passing grade criteria.
  5.2.10. Grading Policies.
     5.2.10.1. Requisite Examinations. The examiner will consider performance on requisite
     examinations in assigning the overall qualification level.
     5.2.10.2. Performance Areas/Subareas. Use the two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U)
     grading system when applying the grading criteria definitions specified in the applicable
     AFI 13-1 MDS-Specific Volume 2, to grade areas/subareas.
         5.2.10.2.1. The examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as ―required‖ in the
         general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 13-1 MDS-Specific
         Volume 2.
         5.2.10.2.2. The examiner will grade any area/subarea observed during an evaluation
         if performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation accomplished or
         flight safety.
         5.2.10.2.3. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth running and stable system
         conditions (i.e., minimal hardware/software, communications and database failures).
         5.2.10.2.4. Minor momentary deviations from grading criteria tolerances are
         acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such
         deviations do not jeopardize safety or mission scenario accomplishment. Consider
         cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
         5.2.10.2.5. The examiner may further identify an area/sub-area as ―Commendable‖
         if, in the examiner’s determination, the crewmember has demonstrated exceptional
         skill and knowledge in that particular area/sub-area. Document commendable areas in
         the examiner’s remarks section of the AF Form 8.
     5.2.10.3. Overall Qualification Levels.
34                     AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


         5.2.10.3.1. The overall qualification level awarded on an evaluation is based on
         performance during both the positional and academic phases. An overall grade of ―Q-
         1‖ or ―Q-2‖ will be awarded only after all evaluation requirements have been
         completed and given due consideration. An overall grade of ―Q-3‖ may be awarded at
         any time.
         5.2.10.3.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the crewmember must
         satisfy the criteria set forth in the applicable AFI 13-1 MDS-Specific Volume 2, and
         demonstrate ability to operate as a crewmember and/or equipment safely and
         effectively during all phases of an evaluation.
         5.2.10.3.3. Overall qualification grades will be a cumulative process. While AFI 13-
         1MDS Specific Volume 2 guidance may dictate the highest grade for an evaluation
         based on area and subarea performance, examiner judgment will always be the
         determining factor in deciding the overall qualification level.
     5.2.10.4. Exceptionally Qualified Designation. An exceptionally qualified designation
     may be awarded by the examiner. The designation can only be applied to the total
     evaluation - not to separate requisites. The designation may be awarded when:
         5.2.10.4.1. The crewmember has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in all
         phases of the evaluation;
         5.2.10.4.2. The crewmember has not failed any requisite and;
         5.2.10.4.3. The crewmember received a qualified grade with no remedial action on
         all areas/subareas evaluated during positional evaluations.
         5.2.10.4.4. The crewmember has achieved a score of 96% or greater on all portions
         of the written examinations.
  5.2.11. Remedial Action. All grades of ―Q-‖ or less require action to remedy the discrepancy
  and/or deficiency in performance. Remedial action includes debriefing discrepancies and/or
  assignment of additional training. See paragraph 5.2.13 when discrepancies result in failure
  to pass a positional evaluation.
     5.2.11.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the
     evaluation wherein the examiner provides briefing/instruction concerning the discrepancy
     and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to
     remedy the discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is annotated with
     ―Debriefed‖ in paragraph B of the Examiner’s Remarks section of the AF Form 8
     Comments.
     5.2.11.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by an examiner to remedy
     deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
     5.2.11.2. (NELLISAFB) Additional Training. SEE will notify the Operations Officer
     (DO) with a description of the additional training and the required completion date.
     Upon completion of additional training, the DO will endorse the letter and return it to the
     Unit SEE. Any additional training assigned must be completed within 30 days. The unit
     SEE will track when the additional training is due, and will annotate completion on the
     AF Form 8.
AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                           35


         5.2.11.2.1. Additional training may include self-study, academic instruction, and use
         of a simulator or live fly event. To complete additional training, the examinee must
         demonstrate attainment of satisfactory knowledge or proficiency.
         5.2.11.2.2. Additional training is documented in paragraph C, Recommended
         Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks in the AF Form 8 Comments
         section. Description of assigned additional training will include how satisfactory
         knowledge or proficiency will be demonstrated to an examiner or instructor.
         5.2.11.2.3. Due dates and dates on which additional training is completed will be
         documented in the appropriate areas of the AF Form 8 (see paragraphs 7.3.5.5).
         5.2.11.2.4. The examiner or instructor who completed the additional training will
         sign as the Certifying Official under Additional Training, Section II, verifying
         completion of all assigned training as documented in paragraph C, Recommended
         Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks.
         5.2.11.2.5. Commanders will ensure required additional training is completed.
         Additional training must be completed within 30 days (2 UTAs) following the date of
         the evaluation. If a crewmember exceeds the allotted time for completion of
         additional training, the squadron commander will review the situation and direct
         appropriate action. Document the circumstances with an MFR placed in Section II of
         the FEF of the affected individual. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR
         onto the affected AF Form 8 under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional
         Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFRs from the FEF. Memos for
         record become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy
         addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8.
  5.2.12. Failure to Pass a Positional Evaluation.
     5.2.12.1. Recheck. If a crewmember fails a positional evaluation, a successful positional
     recheck must be completed within 30 days (2 UTAs) after the date of the first failure. A
     recheck is successfully completed when the crewmember performs to ―Q‖ criteria (Q or
     Q-/debriefed) for each area graded ―U‖. GROUP/CC or ADS/DOs and 154 OSF/CC may
     approve waivers to the time limits in this paragraph on a case-by-case basis. Document
     such action with an MFR placed in Section II of the FEF. Incorporate the information
     contained in the MFR onto the affected AF Form 8 under Examiner Remarks, paragraph
     D, Additional Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF.
     Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy
     addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8. Every reasonable
     effort must be made to requalify the individual. Commanders will determine the number
     of sims or live fly events to be allowed during this period, based on the individual’s
     experience level, present qualifications and hours of training required. The examiner that
     administered the original check will not normally administer the recheck.
     5.2.12.2. Status Downgrade. Downgrade crewmembers receiving a ―Q-3‖ QUAL or
     MSN evaluation to non-combat mission ready (N-CMR), or non-basic mission capable
     (N-BMC), as applicable. For instructor evaluations, crew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC)
     need not be downgraded if the discrepancies were only in instructor areas.
36                      AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


  5.2.13. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
  judgment of the examiner, restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until successful
  completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
     5.2.13.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase (i.e., live control) and/or
     operation that require supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
         5.2.13.1.1. Substandard performance in any area/subarea may require restrictions to
         ensure operational safety or mission accomplishment.
         5.2.13.1.2. If defined in the MDS specific Volume 1 and/or Volume 2, formal
         schoolhouses will include restrictions on the AF Forms 8 for any core item not
         accomplished due to training limitations, regardless if the method of qualification is
         by evaluation or instructor certification. Under no circumstance will crew perform
         core items in which they are not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an
         instructor. In this case, MDS specific guidance will set the time requirement for
         completion of additional training.
     5.2.13.2. Specific restrictions and the criteria for the removal of the restrictions will be
     documented as the first item of the AF Form 8 Comments. Restrictions associated with
     failed requisite examinations will not be documented on the AF Form 8.
     5.2.13.3. Restrict crew member receiving a ―Q-3‖ on an evaluation until a successful
     evaluation is completed:
         5.2.13.3.1. For QUAL evaluations, place the examinee on supervised status in the
         MDS in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the
         evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional crew positions for multiple
         qualified crew maintaining qualification for similar duty in the MDS. AFI 13-1 MDS-
         Specific Volumes 2 may direct supervised status in the MDS in which the individual
         maintains qualification.
         5.2.13.3.2. MSN Evaluation. The examinee may perform basic qualification tasks
         unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on supervised status for mission
         tasks.
  5.2.14. Supervised Status. If unsatisfactory performance or restriction requires the
  crewmember be placed on supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or
  designated supervisor) will be determined by the squadron commander (or equivalent) and as
  specified in AFI 13-1 MDS-Specific Volume 1. Supervision will be accomplished by
  instructors or designated supervisors (as specified in AFI 13-1 MDS-Specific Volume 1)
  qualified in the specific crew position.
  5.2.15. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If a crewmember fails
  to complete an evaluation (either academic phase or positional phase) within the eligibility
  period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in paragraph
  5.2.7.2 for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, the crewmember loses the qualification
  covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph 5.2.13.3 apply. Qualification
  may be re-established by administering a requalification evaluation (see paragraph 5.2.3.2)
  or by completion of the delinquent evaluation. Group/CCs, ADS/DOs, and 154 OSF/CC may
  approve waivers to preclude the re-accomplishment of completed requisites to complete the
AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                              37


   evaluation on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with an MFR placed in Section II
   of the FEF. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected AF Form 8
   under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action is complete, and
   remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF only
   when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later
   Form 8.
   5.2.16. Multiple Qualifications. Multiple qualification guidance applies to crewmembers
   who maintain qualification in two or more mission crew positions in an MDS.
      5.2.16.1. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All crewmembers require a QUAL
      evaluation, and, if applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each crew
      position. Dual qualified individuals are required to complete MSN evaluations for their
      secondary or tertiary qualifications.
      5.2.16.2. Failure to Pass an Evaluation. A downgrade resulting from a ―Q-3‖ in QUAL
      or MSN evaluation applies only to that specific crew position in a particular MDS for
      which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the
      discrepancy is applicable to additional crew positions.
5.3. Examiner Objectivity Evaluation.
   5.3.1. . An examiner administers an objectivity evaluation to determine whether another
   examiner is qualified to administer a qualification evaluation IAW Attachment 12. The
   overall rating for an objectivity evaluation is either ―Q‖ or ―UQ.‖ Observations, analysis, and
   other substantial actions are directed primarily at the examiner conducting the evaluation and
   will not interfere with or affect the individual on position except for flight safety issues.
   5.3.2. A ―Q‖ rating indicates that the observed examiner complied with higher headquarters
   and local stan/eval directives, properly briefed and debriefed the examinee, correctly
   identified discrepancies, awarded the correct area and overall rating, properly documented
   the evaluation, and, if required, recommended appropriate additional training.
   5.3.3. A ―UQ‖' rating is given when the observed examiner fails to satisfy the requirements
   of paragraph 5.3.2. An overall ―UQ‖ grade must be given if any task area is rated ―UQ.‖
   (See Attachment 12.)
   5.3.4. NAF ground C2 systems examiners maintaining a CMR or BMC qualification may
   perform an objectivity evaluation on any ground C2 examiner. Unit Chiefs of Stan/Eval (or
   designated representative) will conduct objectivity evaluations on all assigned examiners.
   5.3.5. An examiner objectivity evaluation does not fulfill the requirements of a qualification
   evaluation.
   5.3.6. Document the examiner objectivity evaluation on AF Form 8 IAW Chapter 7.
   5.3.7. AF Form 8 will be reviewed, approved, and filed in the examinee's evaluation folder.
   5.3.8. NAF examiners and unit Chiefs of Stan/Eval are not authorized to change or to direct
   a change of rating (area or overall) on AF Form 8 completed by a unit examiner unless a
   valid administrative error was made.
5.4. Supplementary Evaluations. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by
a commander to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to operational problems. Use of
 38                       AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


positional supplementary evaluations will aid in obtaining additional information to support the
existence of an adverse or positive trend, identify other deficiencies, or establish that a corrective
action previously implemented is continuing to provide an effective solution. These evaluations
are most often administered as inspections (using specifically prepared checklists) where results
are reported to the commander. The form and content of supplementary evaluations is at the
discretion of the commander.
   5.4.1. Supplementary evaluations are not crew qualification evaluations.
   5.4.2. Commanders will determine evaluated areas. The stan/eval function will determine the
   period and method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative management of data
   collection, and will report results as directed by the commander.
   5.4.3. When required, individuals other than examiners, as determined by the commander,
   may assist in conducting supplementary evaluations.
   5.4.4. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a positional
   evaluation. For example, an examiner may perform a positional supplementary evaluation of
   the WD's handover coordination procedures while conducting a complete qualification
   evaluation of a WD.
   5.4.5. If conducted on position, supplementary evaluations should not be all-encompassing,
   nor result in the assignment of an overall rating for any specific crewmember, nor be
   documented on an AF Form 8. Positional supplementary evaluations do not constitute
   qualification evaluations (exception: flight safety).
   5.4.6. The focus of any positional supplementary evaluation should be one specific area of
   crew performance such as radio transmissions, crew pre-mission briefings or checklist use.
   These areas are listed as examples and are not intended to be used as mandatory areas to be
   inspected. Specific areas of emphasis are needed so that data logged during positional
   supplementary evaluations may be used to identify trends or deficiencies as well as their
   cause.
   5.4.7. The Chief of Stan/Eval will accomplish the following procedures when a specific area
   is identified for a positional supplementary evaluation:
       5.4.7.1. Outline the specific objectives of the evaluation and ensure development of
       checklists for use by examiners.
       5.4.7.2. Determine an adequate time frame in order to achieve the objectives.
       5.4.7.3. Notify operations personnel of the evaluation objectives and time frame for
       evaluation.
       5.4.7.4. Ensure examiners record the results of each evaluation.
       5.4.7.5. Consolidate the information obtained during the evaluation period.
       5.4.7.6. Evaluate the results and determine if corrective actions should be recommended.
       5.4.7.7. Report positional supplementary evaluation results to the commander (ANG
       ADS/DO) through the DO. The report will include the objectives of the evaluation, the
       time frame during which it was performed, discrepancies that were noted, recommended
AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                           39


     corrective action, and suspense dates for completion of corrective action. The DO
     approves and endorses all recommendations for corrective actions.
     5.4.7.8. Perform follow-up to ensure that completed corrective action was effective.
  5.4.8. Supplementary evaluation results will be documented in SEB minutes.
  5.4.9. Retain a copy of positional supplementary evaluation reports and checklists developed
  for at least one year.

                                          Chapter 6

                                  CREW EXAMINATION

6.1. Purpose. The crew examination measures crewmember knowledge of normal procedures,
threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective operation of their assigned
weapon system through the administration of written, computer-based or electronic
examinations. Poor testing performance on examinations indicates areas requiring increased
training emphasis.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to air battle managers (13BXX) and aerospace control and
warning technicians (1C5/1C5D) or Canadian equivalent C2 operations personnel.
Examinations in this chapter include requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and unit
periodic examinations. Requisite examinations include qualification open book (if applicable)
and closed book examinations as described in paragraph 5.2.4. The ability to focus on specific
knowledge areas is enhanced by the management of examination content and use of appropriate
master question files.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Documentation. Units will describe the unit crew examination process in the unit
   supplement to this instruction.
   6.3.2. Computer Based or Electronic Examinations. Computer based or electronic
   information management tools may fulfill the requirement for examinations as outlined in
   this instruction.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. When not using LMS for examinations, the
   stan/eval function will retain graded exam answer sheets/computer records until the AF Form
   8 is completed.
   6.3.4. Examination Question Review. The stan/eval function will review all MQFs, secure
   question banks, and prepared exams for accuracy annually and after any changes in source
   documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a source document change it may
   be annotated as the annual review. Units will document their procedures for reviewing and
   updating MQFs and prepared exams IAW Attachment 9.
   6.3.5. End-of-Course Examinations. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses
   listed in the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) database
   (https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) examinations to fulfill the
   requirements of the closed book requisite examinations.
       6.3.5.1. The stan/eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate
       with the MDS lead command to ensure the EOC examination meets the requirements of
       this instruction and AFI 13-1 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 before awarding credit for
       requisite completion.
       6.3.5.2. EOC examination test questions do not need to incorporate MAJCOM MQFs.
       All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures
       and not conflict with any MQFs.
AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                             41


       6.3.5.3. All EOC examinations that fulfill the requirements of requisite examinations will
       be graded according to paragraph 6.4.3.1 and entered on the AF Form 8 according to
       paragraph 7.3.5.1.
6.4. Requisite Examinations. Crewmembers will complete open book (if applicable) and/or
closed book examinations (if applicable) as requisites for periodic QUAL evaluations (see
paragraph 5.2.4.1), and any other examinations required by the appropriate AFI 13-1 MDS-
Specific Volume 2 (see paragraph 5.2.4.2). Requisite examinations will be accomplished prior
to the INIT positional evaluation.
   6.4.1. Requisite Examination Management. Maintain either requisite examinations for each
   crew position or generate a unique test for each crewmember requiring an exam.
       6.4.1.1. If requisite examinations are maintained for each crew position:
          6.4.1.1.1. MAJCOM is required to develop and maintain requisite examinations for
          each crew position normally generated and stored on the LMS. The LMS will
          generate random examinations.
          6.4.1.1.2. DRUs are required to develop and maintain a minimum of two requisite
          examinations for each crew position IAW Attachment 9.
          6.4.1.1.3. Units that maintain hard copies of the requisite examinations must change
          a minimum of 50 percent of the questions each calendar year.
       6.4.1.2. If a unique test is generated for each crewmember requiring an exam:
          6.4.1.2.1. Units must use MAJCOM-approved LMS for test creation.
          6.4.1.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain a sufficient number of questions to
          ensure a probability of no more than 50 percent duplication of questions for each test
          generated.
   6.4.2. Examination Security. If a MAJCOM approved hard copy of the examination is used,
   stan/eval personnel will maintain positive control of all requisite exams, applicable answer
   sheets and associated computer based/electronic media.
   6.4.3. Grading Policy for Examinations.
       6.4.3.1. Minimum Passing Grade. The minimum passing grade for all stan/eval requisite
       examinations is 85 percent.
   6.4.4. Examination Question Sources.
       6.4.4.1. Open Book Requisite Exam (If applicable). Open book questions will come
       from publications containing information pertinent to the operation of applicable MDS
       and performance of the assigned mission. The open book subject areas and the
       publications used to generate the exam will be made available to the crew. Each unit may
       develop an open book secure question bank (SQB) that serves as the source for some or
       all of the open book examination questions. Do not distribute the SQB to unit crews and
       safeguard it in the same manner as any other required stan/eval examination. Electronic
       publications may be used for open book examinations.
42                      AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


     6.4.4.2. Closed Book Requisite Exams. Closed book questions will come from MQFs.
     These questions will emphasize system knowledge and information necessary for safe
     operations and mission accomplishment IAW Attachment 9.
         6.4.4.2.1. MDS-Specific MQFs. Lead command MAJCOMs will ensure MDS-
         Specific MQFs containing approved questions for closed book testing are available
         for MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable crew IAW Attachment 9.
            6.4.4.2.1.1. The highest organization with a stan/eval function (NAF or unit) may
            develop, maintain and publish MQFs for weapons systems (DRU) without
            MAJCOM expertise. That organization will submit these MQFs to the MAJCOM
            for approval prior to their publication IAW Attachment 9.
            6.4.4.2.1.2. MAJCOM OPRs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes
            to MQFs as necessary.
                6.4.4.2.1.2.1. Units that do not have MQF on the LMS may edit MQFs to
                accommodate local testing procedures, administrative errors and reflect recent
                changes to systems and/or operational procedures; however, subject matter
                may not be changed.
                6.4.4.2.1.2.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate
                MAJCOM IAW Attachment 9.
         6.4.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local
         procedures MQF databank to augment HHQ MQFs IAW Attachment 9.
  6.4.5. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam. An evaluation will not be complete until the
  examination is successfully accomplished. The initial failure results in NCMR/NBMC status
  until successful completion of the re-examination.
     6.4.5.1. Reexamination Policy. Any crewmember failing a requisite examination at any
     time must be afforded an adequate study period (at least 24 hours) prior to reexamination.
     The crewmember will be using an alternate exam. Failure of the reexamination will result
     in a downgrade to ―UQ‖ status.
     6.4.5.2. Reexamination Period. Crewmembers who fail a requisite examination must
     complete a successful reexamination within 30 day (2 UTAs) following the date of the
     first failure, or the end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first. Waiver authority
     to extend the time allowed to successfully complete the examination is the Group/CC,
     ADS/DO. Document such waivers with an MFR placed in Section II of the FEF of the
     affected individual. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
     AF Form 8 under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action
     is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a permanent
     part of the FEF only when the major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed
     or corrected by a later Form 8.
     6.4.5.3. Supervised Status Requirement. Crewmembers who fail a requisite open book (if
     applicable), or closed book examination must be supervised by an instructor until
     successful retesting is completed. For crewmembers who maintain multiple
     qualifications, supervised status resulting from failure of either an open (if applicable) or
AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                              43


       closed book examination applies only to the crew position for which the examination was
       administered.
6.5. Unit Periodic Examinations (optional). Each group/squadron stan/eval function may
conduct periodic testing for all crew. The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional
knowledge beyond the scope of requisite exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge,
tactical/threat knowledge, and/or operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge
deficiencies exist within the unit. This exam may be open (if applicable) or closed book, but will
not count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy the requirement for a periodic
exam. Units will describe this program in the unit supplement to this instruction, to include
procedures for failed exams.

                                     DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the crew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications and authorizations for which a crewmember is to be evaluated
are determined from the unit certification document. The results of crew evaluations are recorded
on the AF Form 8, which certifies the qualification of the crewmember. The chronological
history of evaluations for a crewmember is recorded on an AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation.
Only use last 4 of the individual’s SSAN. The AF Form 8 is maintained in the FEF for the
crewmember.
7.2. Qualifications and Certifications. Crew qualifications are attained through evaluations
and documented on the AF Form 8, as applicable. Crew certifications attained through methods
other than evaluation (instructor-certified events and commander certifications for example) may
be documented on an AF Form 4141/Learning History within the LMS. As an alternative to use
of AF Form 1381 or AF Form 4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification
document signed by an authorized official.
7.3. AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. Use the AF Form 8 to record crew qualification. Certification of an AF Form
   8 is accomplished by four individuals, beginning with the Examiner, who completes the
   evaluation by signing the AF Form 8. Next, the Reviewing Officer and Final Approving
   Officer review the contents, the examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all required additional
   training was adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete, and sign the AF
   Form 8. The final signature is provided by the examinee, who will sign the completed AF
   Form 8.
EXCEPTION: For a Commander-Directed Downgrade AF Form 8, only the commander signs
as the Final Approving Officer. See paragraph 7.3.8.
       7.3.1.1. Use a separate AF Form 8 for each crew qualification.
       7.3.1.2. (Added-NELLISAFB) Processing of AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
       Qualification: Unit SEEs will electronically submit a draft copy of the AF Form 8 to 57
       WG/WGV after completing an evaluation, but prior to printing and routing for signatures.
       WGV will review IAW 57 WG Form 8 Guide. The unit SEE will place a Temporary
       Qualification Certificate in the individual’s Training Folder (TF) within 24 hours after the
       completion of the evaluation.
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. Use the following guidance when completing an AF Form 8. See
   Attachment 3 for sample AF Form 8s.
       7.3.2.1. For date fields in the AF Form 8 use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-
       digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required by the form.
       7.3.2.2. The Eligibility Period and Expiration Date of Qualification will use a three-letter
       month and two-digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required by
       the form.

7.5. AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. The AF Form 942 is an index providing pertinent
information extracted from all the AF Forms 8 accomplished by the crewmember.
   7.5.1. Data Entry. The sample AF Form 942 is provided to demonstrate the content, not the
   format, of the data presented (see Attachment 4.)
       7.5.1.1. To facilitate the entry of data on the form, except type of evaluation designations
       in capital letters, use upper and lower case letters.
       7.5.1.2. Requirements for letter font, numbers of spaces for indentation and justification
       (right, left, or centered) of data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct
       specific format standards for such data entry.
       7.5.1.3. A one-line entry is used for all evaluations with the exception of those on which
       the qualification levels awarded portions of a combined evaluation are not all the same.
       7.5.1.4. For combined evaluations in which different qualification levels are awarded for
       any of the portions, a single line entry will be made for each different qualification level
       awarded indicating which portions of the combined evaluation received that qualification
       level.
       7.5.1.5. Use each AF Form 942 until it is filled or ―Z‖ out any unused blocks.
   7.5.2. Type MDS/Crew Position. Enter type MDS used and crew position during the
   evaluation as it appears in the MDS/Crew Position area under Examinee Identification of the
   subject AF Form 8.

   evaluation in which different qualification levels were awarded to different portions - see
   paragraph 7.3.5.4.4) as it appears in the Mission/Check area under Positional Phase of the
   subject AF Form 8. If the evaluation did not include a positional phase, enter type of
   evaluation as it appears in the Examination/Check area under Academic/Sim Phase of the
   subject AF Form 8.
   7.5.4. Date Completed. Enter date from the Date Completed block of the subject AF Form 8
   (i.e., the latest completion date of the evaluation academic, sim and positional phase
   requisites or additional training).
   7.5.5. Qualification Level. Enter the appropriate qualification level as it appears on the
   subject AF Form 8 (1, 2, 3 or 3/1).
   7.5.6. Computer Generated AF Form 942. A computer generated AF Form 942 may be used
   as long as cumulative entries are retained. Computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms
   as published on the Air Force e-Publishing web site. Electronic copies of the AF Form 942
   should be forwarded with the FEF when the individual moves to a new squadron. If
   electronic backups are normally maintained on removable storage media (e.g., DVD-
   ROM/CD-ROM, external hard drive, floppy disk) or are specifically prepared to facilitate
   transfer of an FEF, file the storage media in Section I of the FEF.
7.6. Flight Evaluation Folders. The FEF contains the source documents that constitute the
history of C2 operations qualification for each crewmember. The AF Form 8 is the source
document used to record and certify the qualification of a crewmember. A complete history of
the AF Forms 8/8a in an FEF is maintained on an accompanying AF Form 942.
AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                            57


  7.6.1. Maintenance. Each crewmember who is on status in an operations crew position must
  have a FEF, which includes all AF Forms 8, AF Forms 942, and additional MAJCOM
  specified items.
     7.6.1.1. The FEF must be maintained by a stan/eval functional office - normally in the
     organization to which the individual is assigned or attached for C2 operations duties.
     7.6.1.2. HHQ personnel on active C2 operations crew status may have their FEFs
     maintained by the stan/eval function at their assigned home stations.
     7.6.1.3. FEF maintenance may be further defined in the MAJCOM supplement to this
     instruction.
     7.6.1.4. Individuals assigned or attached to other than USAF units may use the format of
     the service of the unit of attachment to document their history of
     qualification/certification.
  7.6.2. Contents of FEF. Divide the FEF into two sections:
     7.6.2.1. Section I (left side). This Section contains AF Forms 942.; see paragraph 7.2
     for use of alternate documentation, MAJCOM required items and those items authorized
     by the unit supplement to this instruction (e.g., logs of initial and annual reviews).
     Section I may contain two tabbed sub-sections, Tabs are optional.
         7.6.2.1.1. AF Forms 942 will be placed on top of Tab 1 this section (when tabs are
         used), in chronological order with the most recent on top. Place qualifications,
         authorizations, and/or cross-references to such documents.
         7.6.2.1.2. Tab 2 (if used) maintain any additional information as directed by
         MAJCOM supplement or paragraph 7.7.2.1.4.
         7.6.2.1.3. If used, file backup electronic storage media in Section I of the FEF.
         7.6.2.1.4. If the FEF is not maintained at the same base with the individual’s training
         record, a copy of the most recent AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for
         Flying or Special Operational Duty, and AF Form 702, Individual Physiological
         Training Record, may be filed in this section behind Tab 2.
     7.6.2.2. Section II (right side). This Section contains AF Forms 8 and Memos for Record
     for all evaluations listed on the AF Form 942 in Section I.
         7.6.2.2.1. File AF Forms 8 in chronological order with the most recent on top.
         Individuals who maintain qualification in two or more crew positions in the same
         mission design series will file AF Forms 8 in chronological order – without
         consideration of MDS or crew position.
         7.6.2.2.2. Memos for record documenting waivers and extensions are filed on top of
         the affected AF Form 8. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the
         affected AF Form 8 under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional Comments,
         when action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Permanent MFRs
         documenting major discrepancies relating to qualification are filed immediately
         above the latest affected AF Form 8 or, in cases where the memo is for items other
         than those found on AF Forms 8, in chronological order with AF Forms 8. Memos for
58                     AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


         record become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy
         addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8.
         7.6.2.2.3. Memos for record documenting major discrepancies of a particular AF
         Form 8 will be filed on top of that AF Form 8 regardless of date the discrepancy is
         discovered.
         7.6.2.2.4. Memos for record documenting similar discrepancies found on multiple
         AF Form 8s will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8.
         7.6.2.2.5. Copies of these source documents may be filed with other unit agencies for
         evaluation program management.
  7.6.3. Description of Folders.
     7.6.3.1. Folders must be letter size, able to separate contents into two sections and
     constructed of heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).
     7.6.3.2. Standard 2 ¾-inch metal fasteners may be used.
     7.6.3.3. Affix a label bearing the individual’s name and last four of SSAN to the inside
     back cover so that the folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information
     on the label if required.
     7.6.3.4. Folders must bear the ―Privacy Act‖ statement or a ―For Official Use Only‖
     label/stamp on both sides of the FEF folder.
  7.6.4. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review and
  how to implement the periodic review of FEFs in the unit supplement to this instruction.
     7.6.4.1. Initial Review. The C2 unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
     crewmembers to establish their currency and qualification prior to their first mission.
         7.6.4.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the currency and
         qualification of the crewmember as determined from the latest applicable
         documentation in Sections I and II of the FEF. Following determination of the
         currency and qualification of the crewmember, the unit maintaining the FEF is
         responsible only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
         7.6.4.1.2. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active C2 operations crew status is
         maintained by the stan/eval function at their assigned stations, that stan/eval function
         will also review the FEF prior to their first mission.
     7.6.4.2. Posting Review. The stan/eval function will review each AF Form 8, AF Form
     1381, or AF Form 4348 when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and
     completeness. This review will confirm that the eligibility period and qualification as
     documented are correct, all required evaluation events were accomplished and requisites
     were accomplished within the eligibility period and that the AF Form 8 contains all
     signatures and initials within allotted time. AF Forms 1381/4348 will be reviewed for
     correct certification signature and to ensure all previous entries are accounted for and are
     accurate. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM supplement.
     7.6.4.3. Periodic Review. The stan/eval function will review all unit FEFs to confirm
     expiration dates used to track required crew qualification evaluations are the same as
AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                             59


     those listed in the FEFs. The interval between reviews will not exceed the qualification
     period window established by paragraph 5.2.6.1 unless a more restrictive review period
     is established by the MAJCOM supplement. Document the periodic review IAW unit or
     MAJCOM supplement. Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is not
     required.
  7.6.5. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8, AF Form
  1381, AF Form 4348, and AF Form 942.
     7.6.5.1. Categories of Discrepancies. Discrepancies are categorized by their impact on
     qualification/certification.
        7.6.5.1.1. Discrepancies that alter the qualification/certification of the affected
        crewmember are considered major.
        7.6.5.1.2. Those discrepancies that do not alter the qualification/certification of the
        affected crewmember are considered minor and include typos, formatting and
        misspellings.
     7.6.5.2. Major Discrepancies Disposition. Identified major discrepancies are documented
     on a permanent MFR filed in Section I or II immediately above the affected AF Form 8
     or in chronological order with the AF Forms 8/1381/4348 for items other than those
     found on AF Forms 8. An MFR created to document late evaluations, Group/CC,
     ADS/DO waivers, etc. is removed from the FEF once the information is incorporated
     onto the completed affected AF Form 8 under Examiner Remarks paragraph D,
     Additional Comments. Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF only when

CMR/BMC qualification.
Critical Task—These are tasks where strict adherence to procedures and directives is
mandatory; failure to satisfactorily accomplish this task directly impacts either overall mission
success or flight safety.
Debriefed Discrepancy—Remedial action taken by an examiner to remedy a discrepancy noted
during an in-flight or, if applicable, simulator evaluation. This action is accomplished during
debrief of the evaluation wherein the examiner provides briefing/instruction concerning the
discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
proficiency to remedy said discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is annotated
with ―Debriefed‖ in the Examiner’s Remarks section of the AF Form 8 Comments.
Direct Reporting Unit (DRU)—This refers to a unit without an intermediate headquarters.
These units will receive formal/informal visits and SAVs IAW Chapter 2.
Downgrade—The downgrading of an individual from CMR/BMC to Unqualified (UQ) status
due to failure of any positional evaluation, or failure to complete a QUAL/MSN by the scheduled
date, or individual is Non-CMR (NCMR)/Non-BMC (NBMC) for six months, or the unit
commander or DO determines the individual to be non-proficient. For non-positional mission-
related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of, administrative or judicial actions. Use

                 RECOMMENDING CHANGES TO AF PUBLICATIONS

A7.1. General. The stan/eval function is responsible for the orderly and efficient processing of
recommended changes to Air Force flying-related publications at each command level. Unless
different guidance is provided by the appropriate AF publication OPR, submit recommended
changes and improvements to Air Force publications on AF Form 847 according to the
procedures below and in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3 (covering completion of the form). Submit
recommended changes for conditions that have negative effects on operational efficiency, to
correct content errors or to recommend improved procedures or processes. Do not use the AF
Form 847 to call attention to typographical, printing or quality errors unless they cause
misinterpretation. Such deficiencies can be remedied by direct communication with the AF
publication OPR.
A7.2. Processing AF Forms 847.
   A7.2.1. Submit and process all AF Forms 847 through MAJCOM channels as outlined in the
   MAJCOM supplement to this instruction, in accordance with routing as outlined in Figure
   A9.1 and in compliance with instructions in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3. ANG units will
   utilize the NAF/MAJCOM command structure with oversight responsibility. Units will
   submit AF Forms 847 electronically to the maximum extent possible.
   A7.2.2. At each level the stan/eval function will document receipt of original AF Forms 847,
   ensure the AF Form 847 reaches the appropriate functional OPR at that level for review,
   forward approved original AF Forms 847 to the next command level while informing the
   preceding command level of disposition (positive and negative) with comments. The advent
   of electronic Forms 847 may allow each level to inform all levels below (including the
   originator) of such disposition. The goal is to keep each command level and the originator
   advised of the progress and disposition of a submitted AF Form 847.
   A7.2.3. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will forward the reviewed original AF Form
   847 to the AF publication OPR. Once the AF publication OPR decides on disposition of the
   AF Form 847, the AF publication OPR will notify the submitting, parent MAJCOM as to
   disposition. The parent MAJCOM will then inform the lower command levels of the
   disposition of the original AF Form 847.
   A7.2.4. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will simultaneously forward information
   copies of AF Forms 847 to all other MAJCOMs that utilize the subject AF publication. The
   other using MAJCOMs may forward comments on the information AF Form 847 suggestions
   to the AF publication OPR.
   A7.2.5. An AF Form 847 may be disapproved by any command level reviewing the original
   AF Form 847. All disapproved recommendations will be returned to the submitting
   command level with justification annotated on the AF Form 847 stating the reason for the
   disapproval. Disapproved recommendations are not normally forwarded to other MAJCOMs,
   but may be forwarded for additional considerations if desired. MAJCOMs may address how
   to resubmit an AF Form 847 disapproved at a command level below the AF publication OPR
   in their supplement to this instruction.
 90                    AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


   A7.2.6. The movement and disposition of the original AF Form 847 will be tracked by the
   stan/eval function at all command levels that review the original AF Form 847. There is no
   requirement to track receipt or disposition of information copies of an AF Form 847.

                              WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS

A9.1. Written Examinations Requirements.
   A9.1.1. Unit stan/eval functions will develop and control written examinations for each
   position. However, when different positions are responsible for identical information,
   stan/eval may use the same examinations for these positions. Written examinations may be
   developed, maintained and administrated through the use of the Learning Management
   System (LMS) for applicable weapons systems.
   A9.1.2. Unit stan/eval will maintain two INIT, MSN and QUAL tests on file for each duty
   position. Unit stan/eval must ensure that no more than 50% of the questions are duplicated
   between tests. If the LMS is used, the applicable MAJCOM is responsible for developing,
   maintaining loading the tests on the LMS.
      A9.1.2.1. The INIT test will consist of 85 questions from the MAJCOM MQF and 15
      questions from the LPMQF.
      A9.1.2.2. The MQE test will consist of 25 questions from the unit MQF.
      A9.1.2.3. The QUAL test will consist of 70 questions from the MAJCOM MQF, 15
      questions from the unit MSN MQF and 15 questions from the LPMQF.
   A9.1.3. USAFAWC WD written examinations will consist of 50 questions from the MQF
   and 50 locally developed questions from the 57 WG MQF that address local procedures. No
   more than 25 of the 57 WG MQF questions will be fill-in-the-blank.
   A9.1.4. The DRU MQF tests will consist of 85 questions from a locally developed MQF and
   15 questions from the LPMQF. The MQF will be locally developed, maintained, and
   published by each unit. Upon completion of the MQF, send a copy of the MQF to HQ
   ACC/DOYG for record.
   A9.1.5. Review all examinations for accuracy annually, as a minimum, and after any
   applicable publication changes.
   A9.1.6. The MAJCOM supplement outlines unit examination procedures.
A9.2. Written Examination Administration Procedures.
   A9.2.1. The minimum passing grade for any written examination is 85%.
   A9.2.2. Grade all examinations prior to the individual's next scheduled period for
   performing operations duties. Critique examinations to 100%.
   A9.2.3. Failure of the written examination will result in retention in training status for
   individuals attempting initial upgrade.
   A9.2.4. For individuals currently CMR/BMC qualified, failure of the written examination
   results in placement in NCMR/NBMC and requires a re-examination.
   A9.2.5. When an individual fails a written examination, notify the unit Designated
   Operations Authority (DOA), CC, DO and COT in writing. The notification will state that
   the individual may only perform positional duties when supervised by an instructor in that
AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                            93


   crew position and also requires a re-examination. Conduct required training IAW Air Force
   Instruction 13-1MCS, Volume 1/AFI 13-1AD Volume 1.
   A9.2.6. A minimum of 24 hours must elapse before a re-examination may be administered to
   allow for an adequate period of study. Use an alternate examination.
   A9.2.7. Accomplish re-examinations within 30 days (2 UTAs) after the COT/NCOIC has
   certified that the individual is ready for the re-examination.
   A9.2.8. Failure of the re-examination will result in an overall rating of ―UQ‖ for the
   qualification evaluation, loss of CMR/BMC status, and a downgrade to UQ.
   A9.2.9. Maintain examination answer sheets until AF Form 8 is signed by the final
   approving officer.
A9.3. Security. Stan/Eval personnel must maintain positive control of all examinations. To
prevent com-promise when not in use, secure examinations and answer keys in a locked
container.
A9.4. MQF. The MQF consist of questions for INIT, MSN, QUAL and LPMQF. The MQF is a
set of questions applicable to crew duty positions and based on the weapons system/unit mission.
The questions are derived from operational publications and MAJCOM training materials. This
question file and sources will be accessible to all unit operations personnel.
   A9.4.1. Responsibilities.
       A9.4.1.1. MAJCOM is responsible for:
           A9.4.1.1.1. Ensuring that applicable MQFs are produced and distributed IAW

           A9.4.1.1.2. Establishing procedures for submission of recommended changes,
           additions and deletions.
       A9.4.1.2. Each NAF (USAFE OG’s) is responsible for:
           A9.4.1.2.1. Reviewing recommended changes, additions and deletions to the MQF.
           A9.4.1.2.2. Each unit is responsible for:
           A9.4.1.2.3. Developing MQE and LP tests (N/A ADS) and the controlling of these
           tests used for written examinations.
              A9.4.1.2.3.1. Administering and grading written tests (for tests not given via the
              LMS).
              A9.4.1.2.3.2. Recommending changes, additions, and deletions and forwarding
              them to their respective NAF. Active duty ACC units will forward
              recommendations through their GROUP.
           A9.4.1.2.4. Review and Update Procedures.
       A9.4.1.3. Stan/Eval functions will continually monitor applicable sections of the MQFs
       for necessary updates. They will accomplish periodic reviews at least annually.
   A9.4.2. For MAJCOM MQFs, the unit Chief of Stan/Eval is authorized to make corrections,
   change spelling, or correct erroneous or invalid questions resulting from recent changes to
 94                     AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


   systems and/or operational procedures. These corrections and any new questions resulting
   from revisions/changes to directives will be submitted in writing through stan/eval channels
   to the MAJCOM OPR within 10 days after implementation. The unit Chief of Stan/Eval will
   maintain a file copy of all recommendations until the next up-date is accomplished.
   A9.4.3. For MAJCOM MQFs, the MAJCOM OPR will provide interim MQF guidance
   pending review and subsequent publication and distribution of a change or revision. MQFs
   will be updated by the OPR as soon as possible after receipt of changes.
A9.5. Classification Guidelines.
   A9.5.1. The overall classification of the MQF is determined by the highest classification of
   its contents.
   A9.5.2. Classify test questions extracted from the MQF according to their classification in
   the MQF. Mark tests appropriately and protect them IAW security directives. Whether they
   contain classified questions or not, handle the tests as controlled items.
A9.6. Development/Publication.
   A9.6.1. MQFs for all direct reporting units (DRUs) within ACC will be locally developed
   and maintained.
       A9.6.1.1. Make applicable MQF volumes accessible to all individuals.
   A9.6.2. The 31/52 Operations Group will consolidate and forward the MQFs for USAFE
   TACS units to HQ USAFE/A3Y for approval. After approval, this MQF will be locally
   reproduced.
A9.7. Examination Questions.
   A9.7.1. Question Sources. Examination questions will focus on information that is necessary
   for safe, effective mission accomplishment. Emphasize systems and operational procedures
   knowledge that the crewmember must immediately recall while performing operational
   duties. Also, key information from publications not immediately available on position will be
   subject to testing.
   A9.7.2. Construction of Questions.
       A9.7.2.1. Write examination questions in a manner that measures knowledge of the
       correct information at the desired level of knowledge.
       A9.7.2.2. Stan/Eval written examinations will contain multiple choice (no less than three
       choices with one most correct answer) or completion/fill–in–the–blank items.
       A9.7.2.3. Completion/fill-in-the-blank performance or computation questions must
       include answer para-meters (for example, answer within +50 knots).
       A9.7.2.4. Questions that have numerical answers will have the answers arranged in order
       from largest to smallest or vice versa.
       A9.7.2.5. In general, avoid negative statements. However, if the word ―not‖ appears in
       the question, either underline it or type it in all capital letters for attention.
       A9.7.2.6. True/False questions will not be used on Local Procedures Master Questions
       Files (USAFE only).
AFI13-1STAN-EVALV2_NELLISAFBSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                                95
