ment on and around Travis AFB. It provides general guidance for unit frequency point of contacts in sub-
mitting and establishing frequency requirements, citizen band radio stations, and electromagnetic
interference resolution. It applies to all military and civilian personnel, including the 615th Contingency
Response Wing, and the 349th Air Mobility Wing (Assoc.) (AFRC), and tenant units who operate or
maintain radio frequency emitting devices on or around Travis Air Force Base.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in

    Radio transmissions on and around Travis AFB will be conducted only on authorized frequencies.
    Users of radio frequencies must maintain a valid authorization for all radio frequencies assigned or
    used in order to minimize interference and ensure continued authorization to operate.

2. Responsibilities.
    2.1. 60th Air Mobility Wing Commander (60 AMW/CC) is responsible for all electromagnetic radia-
    tion emanating from the installation and from those outlying activities hosted by the installation. 60
    Communications Squadron Commander (60 CS/CC) appoints the Installation Spectrum Manager (60
    CS/SCOTR), on behalf of 60 AMW/CC, to manage the RF spectrum program.
    2.2. Installation Spectrum Manager (60 CS/SCOTR):
       2.2.1. Implements AFI 33-118, Electromagnetic Spectrum Management, as supplemented.
       2.2.2. Implements AFI 10-707, Spectrum Interference Resolution (SIR) Program.
       2.2.3. Implements AFMAN 33-120, Electromagnetic Spectrum Management.
    2.3. Using Activity:
       2.3.1. Identifies a unit point of contact for all frequency management matters to the Installation

    tolerances.
    3.5. Acts promptly to resolve and report incidents of electromagnetic interference (EMI), IAW AFI
    10-707, and paragraph 8. of this instruction.
    3.6. Immediately informs the Installation Spectrum Manager of frequencies no longer required.
    3.7. Requests the minimum number of frequencies necessary to accomplish the mission and uses min-
    imum transmitter power and antenna gain or height.
    3.8. Uses radiation-suppression devices (dummy loads) as much as possible when tuning, testing, or
    experimenting with radio devices.
    3.9. Coordinates frequency actions in advance with the Installation Spectrum Manager, to include
    purchase of new equipment such as RF transmitters/receivers and associated equipment, antennas, or
    when changing locations of current equipment.
    3.10. Ensures proper radio procedures are followed and all transmissions are for official government
    business.
    3.11. Ensures all RF radiating sites have Site License posted close to equipment.

4. Procedures for Submitting and Establishing Frequency Requirements.
   4.1. The user must initiate all required paperwork prior to requesting frequency assignments. New
   assignments require a lead-time of 120 days.
   4.2. The request must have:
       4.2.1. Project Workflow Requirements Resource (PWRR) document located at: https://
       w3.travis.af.mil/60cs/ (CS home page). The PWRR will include:
       4.2.2. Required operational date.
       4.2.3. The requested frequency, why it is required, who will use it, and how it will be used.
       4.2.4. Type of equipment and antenna to be used, including military/civilian nomenclature, emis-
       sion and frequency band the equipment operates.
       4.2.5. Power, gain, and height of the antenna.
       4.2.6. Location of transmitter and receiver (longitude and latitude in degrees-minutes-seconds).
       4.2.7. Equipment currently not approved for government use will require a J/F-12 (Frequency
       Application Index) allocation number. The project officer and engineers of the equipment must
       submit DD Form 1494, Application for Equipment Frequency Allocation, to request a J/F-12 num-
       ber from the Department of Defense. The Installation Spectrum Manager will provide assistance
       in filling out the appropriate paperwork.

5. Five Year Reviews, Modifications, or Deletions.
   5.1. Five-year review actions are initiated by the Installation Spectrum Manager. The user is asked to
   review their parameters and reply by e-mail. If the frequency is no longer needed or the parameters
   have changed, the user must provide the appropriate information to the Installation Spectrum Manager
   for further action.
   5.2. Any modification and/or deletion must be submitted by e-mail to the Installation Spectrum Man-
   ager. Detailed information may be required for modifications. There is no specific format for dele-
   tions.

6. Temporary/Exercise Frequency Request.
   6.1. The base-wide Trunking System will be utilized for land mobile radio (LMR) requests within
   Travis AFB. Units must notify the manager at least 60 days before arrival and programming will be
   accomplished at a rate of ten units per day.
   6.2. Equipment Requirements:
       6.2.1. Narrowband, digital APCO25, Smartnet trunking radios which operate in the 406-420 MHz
       band.
   6.3. Non-trunking frequency requests require lead-times of 90 days for overseas requirements, 60
   days for requirements in the Continental United States (CONUS), and 30 days for CONUS assign-
   ments that can be supported with AMC-controlled frequencies. These frequencies are limited to
   ultra-high (UHF)/very high (VHF) air-to-air, UHF/VHF air-to ground, Station Keeping Equipment,
   and high frequency (HF) voice and data.

    Tanker Airlift Control Center (618 TACC).
    6.5. Tasking to support exercises at other locations with Land Mobile Radio (LMR) equipment must
    be cleared by the host base LMR/Trunking manager. Frequency approval is not necessary if the host
    base has the assigned frequency, and the primary user agrees to share the net. A frequency approval is
    required if the frequency is not assigned to the exercise location.
    6.6. Include type, model, and power of the equipment to be used with these requests. (Example:
    Scope Shield Radios, model PRC-139, one-half to two watts).

       7.2.2. Portable/mobile radio equipment will not be operated within close proximity to Air Force
       installed equipment such as aircraft control facilities, refueling or defueling sites, fuel storage
       areas, VHF/UHF transmitter/receiver sites, etc.
       7.2.3. Antennas will be installed IAW Base Civil Engineer (CE) regulations and submitted on an
       AF Form 332, BCE Work Request. The user is responsible for coordinating with the Installation
       Spectrum Manager and with CE on all aspects of the antenna installation. Under no circumstances
       will antenna installation be conducted until written permission from the Base Civil Engineer
       (BCE) is granted and is in the individual's possession.

8. Electromagnetic Interference Resolution.
    8.1. Proper reporting procedures are stated in AFI 10-707, paragraph 3.

9. Forms Adopted. AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request; DD Form 1494, Application For
