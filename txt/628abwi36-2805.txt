                  SAMPLE VOLUNTEER NOMINATION NARRATIVE


                                VOLUNTEER OF THE YEAR

Jane L. Doe-Charleston is a family member of an active duty technical sergeant in the 628th
Communications Squadron. Jane has been a sterling performer, exemplifying all that is excellent
in an Air Force volunteer. She has been volunteering with the enlisted spouses council (ESC) for
over two years and was selected vice president during the last election. She has been active in
every ESC function this year. In fact, during the Chief’s Induction Ceremony, Mrs. Doe single-
handedly decorated The Columbus Club and after the scheduled singer cancelled, she
volunteered to sing the National Anthem. Her contributions were called ―truly outstanding‖ by
AMC/CC. Always eager to support the base’s recognition ceremonies, Jane’s annual ―Taste of
Charleston‖ cook-off and the resulting ―Globemaster Cookbook‖ have become a local festive
event generating over $30,000 for the ESC. Her idea and tireless work has enabled the ESC to
award family trips to Florida for each annual award winner!

A true self-starter, Jane organized the youth center’s first-ever female lacrosse team. True to her
usual form, ―coach‖ Jane received an honorable mention by Lacrosse Monthly and was featured
in an Air Force Times article on ―Unbelievable Volunteers.‖ Always the Air Force ambassador,
she continues to promote the Air Force as a viable option whenever she is asked to speak at local
school ―career days.‖

Without a doubt, Mrs. Doe-Charleston has been one of the single-most influential volunteers
Charleston has ever seen! Her dedication to the base and Air Force is evident by her recent
selection as the Air Force Times Woman of the Year!
