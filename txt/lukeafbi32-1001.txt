This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-10, Installations and
Facilities. This instruction establishes responsibilities and procedures to provide emergency
Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration (HVAC/R) and standby electrical
power maintenance and support to critical facilities. This instruction applies to all organizations,
which have a back up generator. This publication does not apply to US Air Force Reserve Units
and its members assigned to Luke AFB. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the
appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at

1. Responsibilities.
     1.1. Resource Management. The 56th Logistics Readiness Squadron Commander will
     provide, through fuels management, on-site refueling for all standby generators.
     1.2. User Organizations. The using organization commander will designate emergency
     generator operators and submit training and recertification requirements to the 56
     CES/CEOIG (Power Production/Barrier Maintenance Shop), reference AFI 32-1063,
     Electrical Power Systems. The using organization will notify the Base Civil Engineer (BCE)
     of any changes of support requirements. To facilitate effective accomplishment of the BCE
     support requirements at critical facilities, the BCE will provide the user a notice of required
     equipment maintenance outages and coordinate scheduled outages that will minimize mission
     impact. This notification will be made far enough in advance to permit the BCE to plan
     preventive maintenance or other support work during the inoperative interval. The user will
     inform BCE Service Call Desk, 856-7231 or                  856-7083, any time an emergency
     generator is started or stopped.
     1.3. Building Managers. Building managers will ensure mechanical and electrical rooms are
     kept clean and free of storage or superfluous items at all times. Also, they will ensure rooms
     are secured, prohibiting entry of unauthorized personnel.
     1.4. Power Production. The Power Production section will provide operator training,
     maintenance, and inspections of generators and associated equipment supporting air
     navigational aids (NAVAIDs) and critical facilities. Power Production personnel will assist
     the Fuels Distribution personnel in refueling standby units during prolonged electrical
     outages. During routine maintenance, Power Production personnel will coordinate with the
     using agency before completing a transfer to generator power.
     1.5. Mechanical Section. The HVAC/R will provide maintenance, repair, and inspections of
     facility heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration systems.
2. Procedures.
     2.1. During emergencies, direct coordination will be maintained during emergencies
     between Power Production, BCE Service Call Desk, and the Fuels Service Center to ensure
     that refueling crews are dispatched to the standby generator in required sequence.
     2.2. Standby personnel will carry beepers to keep in contract with BCE Service Call Desk
     during their tour. Standby personnel will respond to electrical power and heating,
     ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration systems failures.
     2.3. Personnel will respond to emergencies in priority order of facilities listed in Attachment
     2. For an electrical power outage; if the installed standby generators fails, a replacement unit
     will be selected from a lower priority mobile unit in Attachment 2.
     2.4. Generator operator functions will be limited to those outlined in the generator operating
     procedures posted at each generator site. Typically this involves preoperational checks, start
     up, load transfer, monitoring, retransfer to commercial power, shut down and documenting
     run-up on AF Form 487, Emergency Generator Operating Log.
     2.5. Emergency backup generators will be tested with the actual load connected as outlined
     in AFI 32-1063.

  2.6. Test runs scheduled for the 56th Communications Squadron (56 CS) facility generators
  will be coordinated between the using organization personnel, and the BCE Power
  Production section prior to the test. Test runs will be based on the BCE Recurring Work
  Program (RWP).
     2.6.1. Testing and maintenance work on the hospital generators will be coordinated with
     the hospital Facility Management Office, prior to any action taken.
  2.7. The point of contract for 24-hour emergencies is the BCE Service Call Desk, 856-7231
  or 856-7083.
