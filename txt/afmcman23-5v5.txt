                                             Chapter 1

                    SYSTEM ACCESS AND CONTINGENCY PLANNING

1.1. Overview. SSSC is expressly tailored to meet the needs of AFMC when the standard
D035A system cannot be used (e.g., when an AFMC Inventory Control Point [ICP] is
established as a focal point for submission of customer requisitions). Within SSSC applications,
Government Furnished Property (GFP) refers to Government-Furnished Material (GFM) and
loan of Agency Peculiar Property (APP). SSSC no longer handles Management Control Activity
(MCA) for repair contractors (EZ Department of Defense Activity Address Codes [DoDAAC]),
but it does contain some historical data.
1.2. System Application.
     1.2.1. The system design contains the following major features:
        1.2.1.1. MCA for Production Contracts. This application is an adaptation of the
        aggregating process and is used in support of GFP provided to production contractors. It
        is a focal point for submission of production contractor requisitions (EY DoDAACs) as
        determined by the contracting ICP. Contractor requisitions are edited by SSSC to
        validate the contractor's DoDAAC, contract number, National Stock Number (NSN), and
        authorized quantity, etc. Requisitions passing these edits are referred to the managing
        ICP and monitored for positive completion of supply actions. See Chapter 3 of this
        volume for details regarding production contract MCA processing.
        1.2.1.2. Aggregation: SSSC has the ability to operate as an aggregating system primarily
        for the purpose of collecting assets for site activation of new weapon systems. It also
        supports special projects such as Foreign Military Sales (FMS) frustrated cargo support.
        It currently can be used by Hill, Robins and Tinker Air Force Bases (AFB). See Chapter
        4 of this volume for details regarding aggregation processing.
1.3. System Access. An individual (military, civilian, or support contractor) working within the
following organizations may request access to SSSC: HQ AFMC; Air Force Audit Agency
(AFAA); Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC); Air Force Life Cycle Management Center
(AFLCMC) Program Management Office (PMO); and, Administrative and Assistance Services
(A&AS) Contractor. Access is limited by the user role, DoDAAC and Manager Designator
Codes (MDC) associated with a User Identification (USERID). Refer to Attachment 2 for
SSSC access procedures.
1.4. SSSC System Contingency Plan. Each AFMC ICP must develop a system contingency
plan that provides guidance to support customers in the event system access is lost due to
emergencies (e.g., earthquake, flood, equipment or facility malfunction, loss of personnel, loss of
energy, sabotage, fire) or when other circumstances impose significant limitations on normal
processing. It is highly recommended that AFMC ICPs use an automated disaster recovery
planning application to develop and maintain their plan.
     1.4.1. Report all subsystem deficiencies, errors, etc., which cause delays, interruptions, rerun
     of production processing or results in inefficiencies to the SSSC Lead Functional OPR in
     AFSC/LG. SSSC Lead and Site Functional OPRs initiate data system Deficiency Reports
     (DR) to resolve system deficiencies.
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                                     9


  1.4.2. Contingency plans must account for the following scenarios:
     1.4.2.1. Platform Availability.
         1.4.2.1.1. SSSC becomes unavailable with no transactions being received or input
         and no data being retrieved; however, interfacing applications are operational (e.g.,
         Distribution Standard System [DSS], D035A, Production Contractor ordering
         systems).
         1.4.2.1.2. SSSC and interfacing applications become unavailable.
     1.4.2.2. Connectivity Availability.
         1.4.2.2.1. Connection to SSSC becomes unavailable but transactions are still being
         received and processed.
         1.4.2.2.2. All communications links go down (i.e., no SSSC, internet access or
         Electronic Mail [E-mail]).
     1.4.2.3. Disruption to users’ normal work space that forces relocation to an alternate
     work site.
     1.4.2.4. Disruption in normal manpower and use of resources.
  1.4.3. Contingency plans must detail how to support the following processes regardless of
  which scenarios apply:
     1.4.3.1. Maintaining aggregation account asset balance visibility. Refer to Chapter 4 for
     an explanation of the various storage sites that maintain wholesale asset balances. Use
     the following methods to obtain asset balance visibility:
         1.4.3.1.1. Obtain Midtier Special Support reports. Asset balances are copied to the
         Midtier on a near real time basis. This means asset balance reports available under
         the Special Support option can be used to provide a snapshot of on-hand balances at
         the start of the contingency.
         1.4.3.1.2. Access asset information via logon to other systems or internet resources.
         Note: Contingency Plans must contain a list of useful systems, websites and AF
         Portal applications (i.e., D035K and DSS).
         1.4.3.1.3. Request other system Points of Contact (POC) provide asset information.
         Note: Contingency Plans must contain a POC list.
     1.4.3.2. Maintaining requisition visibility. Refer to Chapters 3 and 4 for an explanation
     of the various methods used to receive requisitions. Use the following methods to obtain
     requisition visibility:
         1.4.3.2.1. Obtain Midtier Special Support reports. Requisitions are copied to the
         Midtier on a near real time basis. This means requisition reports available under the
         Special Support Reports option can be used to provide a snapshot of open requisitions
         at the start of the contingency.
         1.4.3.2.2. Contact Data Transaction Services (DTS) for assistance. DTS personnel
         may be able to provide a list of transactions received but not successfully delivered to
 10                                                         AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014


          the AFMC ICP local router (e.g., Automated Intersite Gateway [AISG] [M024B]).
          See Chapter 2 for interfacing systems.
          1.4.3.2.3. Contact AFMC ICP local router support personnel for assistance. Support
          personnel may be able to provide a list of transactions received from DTS, but not
          successfully delivered to Mainframe or Midtier.
          1.4.3.2.4. Access requisition information via logon to other systems or internet
          resources.
          Note: Contingency Plans must contain a list of useful systems, websites and AF
          Portal applications (e.g., DSS, Web Visual Logistics Information Processing System
          [WeBVLIPS], Tracker).
      1.4.3.3. Releasing available assets to fill requisitions. Contingency plans must consider
      the following methods to release assets:
          1.4.3.3.1. Request storage activity process offline release action.
          1.4.3.3.2. Manually input shipping request into a non-collocated D035K system.
          1.4.3.3.3. Create offline shipping request (Materiel Release Order [MRO] or
          Redistribution Order [RDO]) transactions for output to M024B/Defense Automated
          Addressing System (DAAS).
      1.4.3.4. Tracking inbound and outbound status. Contingency plans must consider the
      following methods to track status:
          1.4.3.4.1. Contact DTS for assistance. DTS personnel may be able to provide a list
          of transactions received but not successfully delivered to the AFMC ICP local router
          (e.g., M024B). See Chapter 2 for interfacing systems.
          1.4.3.4.2. Contact AFMC ICP local router support personnel for assistance. Support
          personnel may be able to provide a list of transactions received from DTS, but not
          successfully delivered to D035A or SSSC.
          1.4.3.4.3. Access status information via logon to other systems or internet resources.
          Note: Contingency Plans must contain a list of useful systems, websites and AF
          Portal applications (e.g., DSS, D035K, WebVLIPS, Tracker).
   1.4.4. Recovery Procedures. Contingency plans must provide guidance for return to normal
   stock control operations. System access will be limited to selected users until all backlogged
   transactions have been processed. Once all backlogged transactions are processed, user
   access will be reestablished for remaining users.
1.5. System Health and User Compliance monitoring and metrics.
   1.5.1. Monitoring. Maintaining a healthy stock control environment requires a System and
   Functional OPR periodic review of chronic areas of concern (e.g., controlled exception
   processing). Specific requirements for system monitoring are identified throughout this
   document.
   1.5.2. Metrics. Trend analyses for known chronic areas of concern are useful in identifying
   other issues for potential monitoring. Specific requirements for metrics tracking are
   identified throughout this document.

  INTERFACES, KEY DATA ELEMENTS, ONLINE ASSISTANCE AND RECORDS
                           RETENTION

2.1. Overview. This chapter has four primary purposes:
   2.1.1. Interfaces. Exchange of data between SSSC and other data processing systems is an
   important function in support of the AFMC logistics mission. Data record formats,
   transmission media, and frequency of exchange through an interface between two data
   processing systems are described by an Interface Control Document (ICD). An ICD is
   developed and maintained by the SSSC Lead OPR for each subsystem.
   2.1.2. Key Data Elements Used by SSSC. Because a System Designator Code (SDC),
   contract number, NSN, Routing Identifier Code (RIC) or document number field is used as a
   key to access virtually every SSSC database record, this chapter also provides additional
   details concerning these five vital fields.
   2.1.3. Online Assistance -- Describes the various methods for users to obtain online
   assistance for SSSC: tutorials, training materiel, simulations, checklists, references and Help
   pages.
   2.1.4. Retention of Records -- Describes the requirements for maintaining source documents
   related to transactions processed by SSSC that affected an accountable balance.
2.2. Interfaces. Many of the data systems involved in information exchange with SSSC are
listed in Table 2.1. Table 2.2 details interfaces for data inbound to SSSC. Table 2.3 details
interfaces for data outbound from SSSC.

2.3. Key Data Elements Utilized by SSSC.
   2.3.1. SDC. This is a two-digit numeric code which uniquely differentiates among the
   various MCA and aggregation accounts by ICP. The SDC always appears in rp 55-56 within
   transactions inbound to SSSC (orders, statuses, validation requests, cancellations, modifiers,
   follow-ups). To view the most current list of approved SDCs, go to Table 6.25.
   2.3.2. Contract Numbers. The three types of contract numbers used by SSSC are unique to
   MCA processing of repair and production contractor orders for GFM and loan. These types
   include Procurement Instrument Identification Number (PIIN), Contract Serial Number
   (CSN) and Abbreviated Contract Number (ABCN). The 13 or 17 position PIIN consists of
   four or five data elements. See Table 2.4 for construction.

Table 2.4. Contract Number

Number       RP                                     Description
 Type
           1-6      Procuring Activity (e.g., F34601) which is part of the basic contract.
           7-8      Year in which the Contract was established (e.g., 06), which is part of the
                    basic contract.
PIIN       9        Type of Contract (e.g., “D”), which is part of the basic contract.
           10-13    Serial Number (e.g., “0327”), which is part of the basic contract.
           14-17    Order Number (e.g., “0001”) for follow-on instances of the basic contract.
                    (optional)
           1        Year Contract Established (e.g., “7” could indicate 1997 or 2007).
           2-5      Serial Number (last four rp of either the basic contract number or the
CSN                 applicable order number [e.g., for F34601-07-D-0001, the serial number
                    would be “0001”; for F34601-07-D-0001-1A22, the serial number would be
                    “1A22”]).
ABCN       1-8      Reference Table 6.1. for ABCN construction

   2.3.3. NSN. The NSN data for SSSC is provided from D043 via D035A. Because the
   National Item Identification Number (NIIN) portion of the NSN must always be unique,
   SSSC edit processes use the NIIN to find the appropriate NSN catalogue record. If the NIIN
   data is correct, but the FSC or Materiel Management Aggregation Category (MMAC) code
   data is not, SSSC is designed to automatically correct the FSC and MMAC data on the
   transaction being processed. Not all NSNs contain a MMAC, and for the same NIIN, another
   service may assign a different MMAC-like value.
       2.3.3.1. Item records must exist within the SCS Midtier for SSSC to perform MCA and
       Aggregation functions (see Chapters 3 and 4). To create an item record within the SCS
       Midtier, access the “Master Item Data” page, type in the applicable NSN then click the
       “New” button. On the resulting “New Item” page, input/select appropriate values (see
       Table 2.5 for values) and click the “Submit” button. Note: the Federal Logistics
       Information System (FLIS) and the Master Item Identification Data Base (MIIDB)
       (D043A) system (with a pass-through capability to FLIS) are valuable sources of
       information needed in creating an item record.

Table 2.6. Document Numbers
 RP           Title                                    Definition
1-6      Activity        1. The term Stock Record Account Number (SRAN) is
         Address Code    frequently used to refer to this field; however the proper
                         terminology is DoDAAC.
                         2. Certain characters in the first position of the serial number are
                         reserved to identify specific actions:
                         2.1. Avoid using - most are inappropriate for use by SSSC.
                         2.2. Those values that are reserved for other use and which will
                         not be used in SSSC can be found in Volume 1, Chapter 3.
                         3. Reference DoD 4100.39-M, Volume 10, Table 41.
7-10     Ordinal Date    Indicates the actual date of the transaction was created.
11-14    Serial Number   This field is assigned at the discretion of the document number
                         originator is used to prevent duplicate document numbers.
                         1. For example, the first document number assigned on a given
                         day would use serial number “0001,” the second would use
                         “0002,” and so on.
                         2. Use of alphabetic characters “I” and “O” will be avoided since
                         they are easily mistaken for the numeric “1” and “0” characters.

        2.3.5.1. AF production contractors create unique document numbers using DoDAACs
        beginning with “EY” for placing GFM and loan orders. Applicable SSSC MCA and
        aggregation account managers create unique document numbers using DoDAACs
        beginning with “FN” and “FW” for placing aggregation orders. This is best
        accomplished by organizations maintaining separate Document Number Register Logs
        for each unique DoDAAC.

              2.5.1.1.1.2. Discoverer ad hoc query is the only method of accessing online
              D034A transaction history. Users with SCS Ad Hoc Query capability can run a
              Discoverer query using the SCS View A5qaa_Trans_Hist_001 Table.
              2.5.1.1.1.3. Table 2 7 reflects by ICP the oldest and most recent data contained
              in the applicable A5qaa_Trans_Hist_001 table. Note: Data is not all-inclusive;
              one or more months’ worth of data is missing for each ICP and the months for
              which data is missing is variable from ICP to ICP.

          2.5.1.1.2. SSSC history transactions fit into one of three basic categories:
              2.5.1.1.2.1. Interrogations using the “Transaction History” page provide
              information regarding database inserts/deletes/updates of MCA authorization
              information going back no further than 30 days.
              2.5.1.1.2.2. Ad hoc Discoverer queries of the SCS View Trans_Hist_001 Table
              provide up to 90 days’ worth of the following short term transaction history:
              orders, modifiers, cancellations, follow-ups, supply statuses, shipment statuses,
              validation requests, validation responses, MROs, denials, replies to cancellations,
              receipts, inventory adjustments, SCC changes, purpose code changes, issues, asset
              reconciliations and obligations.
              2.5.1.1.2.3. Access of multiple canned report queries (see Chapter 7 for options)
              can provide up to 75 months of the following long term transaction history:
              orders, modifiers, cancellations, follow-ups, supply statuses, shipment statuses,

            validation requests, validation responses, MROs, denials, replies to cancellations,
            receipts, inventory adjustments, SCC changes, purpose code changes, issues, asset
            reconciliations and obligations.
     2.5.1.2. Not all historical records are formatted as transactions. Other archived data
     often is formatted as a snapshot in time of data elements from a single or multiple
     databases. No D034A system non-transactional data is available. Non-transactional data
     is available online in the SCS Midtier for SSSC only via special interrogation. Users
     with SCS Ad Hoc Query capability can run Discoverer queries using various SCS
     database tables. See the SCS Fields/Tables and Tables/Fields Cross Reference Listings
     noted in paragraphs 2.4.6.3.1 and 2.4.6.3.2 above.
  2.5.2. Hard Copy Records. There are no specific requirements for retention of hard copy
  records produced out of either SSSC or its predecessor D034A system.

              PRODUCTION CONTRACTOR REQUISITIONS FOR GFM

3.1. Overview. There exists unique designation absent in SSSC as follows:
   3.1.1. Although unique AFLCMC/HNC designations are absent in SSSC, wherever possible
   AFLCMC/HNC personnel will adopt Warner Robins ICP designations, obtain access to
   SSSC and perform the functions of the MCA Account Manager (for validating production
   contractor GFM orders against AFLCMC/HNC issued production contracts) on its own.
   3.1.2. Although unique PMO designations are absent in SSSC, each AFMC PMO will
   negotiate with MCA processing personnel at each ALC to establish an MCA Account
   Manager for the PMO contract which authorizes production contractor GFM. The most
   probable choice for a PMO would be the ICP which has management oversight for the
   weapon system supported by the applicable contract. Otherwise, the PMO may choose to
   negotiate with personnel at either the closest ICP or the ICP with which that PMO has
   familiarity due to past dealings. In all cases, this workload will adapt to the selected ICP’s
   designations for MCA processing (e.g., SDC, MCA Routing Identifier, Distribution Code,
   etc.). Actual MCA execution is handled in one of two ways:
       3.1.2.1. The PMO and ICP may agree that ICP personnel will assume MCA Account
       Manager duties for the PMO contract (e.g., contract master establishment and update in
       SSSC).
       3.1.2.2. The PMO and ICP may agree that PMO personnel will obtain access to SSSC
       using that ICP’s designations and function as the MCA Account Manager on its own.
       3.1.2.3. To arrange for MCA account management of contracts issued by their
       organizations, AFLCMC/HNC and PMO personnel may work through the SSSC Site
       OPRs.
   3.1.3. View procedures for production contractors to order maps, charts and geospatial
   products and DLA policy/procedures at http://www.aviation.dla.mil/rmf/.
3.2. Procedures. The procedures contained herein apply to processing production contractor
requisitions for GFM through the SSSC system. This information is based upon procedures
contained in various sections and Appendix B of contracts under which a production contractor
is authorized to order materiel from government activities as GFM.
3.3. Elements Mandated, Optional and Derived in SSSC to Validate Production
Contractor Requisitions.
   3.3.1. Mandatory Contract Identification Data. Valid contract identification data elements
   are manually file-maintained within SSSC by the assigned MCA Account Manager for the
   applicable production contract. This data includes information sufficient for SSSC to relate
   an incoming production contractor requisition to an existing production contract for which
   the contractor is authorized to order materiel from U.S. government sources as GFM.
       3.3.1.1. SDC: A 2-position numeric element that identifies which MCA account a
       production contract applies. Current values are: “71” for contracts managed at OO ICP;
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                                  21


     “73” for contracts managed at OC ICP; and “85” for contracts managed at WR ICP.
     Manual file maintenance of this data element is mandatory.
     3.3.1.2. Contract Number: A 13 or 17 position alpha/numeric element constructed as
     follows: rp 1-6 contain an alpha/numeric element that identifies which activity issued the
     contract (e.g., F34601 = OC ICP); rp 7-8 contain the year in which the contract was
     awarded; rp 9 contains a type contract code (D = production); rp 10-13 contain a
     serialized control element; rp 14-17 contain a delivery order element. Manual file
     maintenance of this data element is mandatory.
     3.3.1.3. SSSC MDC: A 3-position alpha/numeric code that identifies the individual
     managing the contract. SSSC uses this information to route controlled exceptions and
     notices for manager action (see Chapter 5). Manual file maintenance of this data
     element is mandatory.
     3.3.1.4. Termination Date: Day/month/year the contract will be considered inactive.
     Manual file maintenance of this data element is mandatory.
     3.3.1.5. Contractor’s DoDAAC: 6-position alpha/numeric element that always begins
     with “EY” and identifies the contractor placing the order. Manual file maintenance of
     this data element is mandatory.
     3.3.1.6. NSN/NIIN: NSN or NIIN of items authorized as GFM for the applicable
     contract/contractor. Note: Before requisitions can be processed, SSSC must reflect
     cataloging management data (CMD) for the item that is being ordered. SSSC users can
     access the “Master Item Data” page online in SSSC to check whether or not information
     already exists for the item in question. If information for the applicable item does not
     exist in the modernized SCS of which SSSC is a part, the user can create an abbreviated
     master record for the item using the “Master Item Data” page online in SSSC and
     following instructions found in Chapter 2. Manual file maintenance of this data element
     is mandatory.
     3.3.1.7. Authorized Quantity: Total quantity authorized to be ordered as GFM against
     the applicable contract for the NSN/NIIN associated with specified contractor DoDAAC.
     Manual file maintenance of this data element is mandatory. Note: Once the basic
     contract master information is established, the applicable MCA Account Manager may
     use a “mass upload” feature to add items or change quantities for items authorized as
     GFM. See Table 3.1 for directions on how to process an online input to SSSC via the
     “Mass Contract Upload” page to either add NSNs to or change the authorized quantities
     for existing NSNs on a production contract. This format is applicable to production
     contract GFM processing only.

 3
        an item not previously authorized on the applicable contract, the quantity input here will
        be the total authorized quantity [e.g., zero + 23 = 23]; for an item already on the contract
        master, the quantity input here would be added to the quantity already shown as
        authorized [e.g., if previously authorized quantity = 7 and the input quantity = 23, 7 + 23
        = 30 becomes the new authorized quantity).
        Access the online SSSC. Click on the “Contracts” button. Select the “Contract File

     3.3.2. Optional Contract Identification Data.
        3.3.2.1. Award Date: Day/month/year contract was awarded. Manual file maintenance
        of this data element is optional.
        3.3.2.2. Project Code: Manual file maintenance of this data element is optional.
        3.3.2.3. Requisition Quantity: Total number of assets ordered to date using the
        applicable contractor DoDAAC for the specified NSN/NIIN. Although this element is
        most properly updated by SSSC as a consequence of referring a valid production
        contractor GFM requisition to the applicable Source of Supply (SOS) and of processing
        SOS rejects/cancellations of referred orders (referral would increase and
        reject/cancellation would decrease this quantity), it may also be manually file maintained
        by the MCA Account Manager if such action is the only way to ensure proper
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                                     23


     computation of the associated line item Open Quantity. Negative quantities in this field
     are created when Cancellation Reimbursement (SSSC automatic update of the
     Requisitioned quantity to adjust for status showing cancellation of quantities on orders
     previously referred to a SOS) is in excess of the Requisitioned quantity. See also
     paragraph 3.3.3.5 below.
     3.3.2.4. Delete: By checking this box and clicking on the “Submit” button further down
     the page, the user instructs SSSC to delete that particular line item (i.e., that combination
     of Contract, Contractor DoDAAC and NSN/NIIN information).
  3.3.3. Derived Contract Identification Data.
     3.3.3.1. GFM Code: Although not displayed, “A” is the only value allowed for
     production contracts; this indicates that the contract specifies, by NSN, the exact quantity
     the contractor is authorized to order. SSSC mechanically applies this code to all
     production contracts.
     3.3.3.2. CSN: 5-position code derived using the last position of the year in which the
     contract number was assigned plus the last four positions of the contract number, either
     rp 10-13 or 14-17 (e.g., for F0960398C0262, the CSN would be 80262). SSSC
     mechanically applies this element to all production contracts.
     3.3.3.3. Total Number of Line Items on this Contract: Self-explanatory.                SSSC
     mechanically computes this count for all production contracts.
     3.3.3.4. Authorized Quantity as of Date: Day/month/year the Authorized Quantity was
     last updated. SSSC mechanically derives this element for all line items.
     3.3.3.5. Requisition Quantity: Total number of assets ordered to date using the
     applicable contractor DoDAAC for the specified NSN/NIIN. Although this element is
     most properly updated by SSSC as a consequence of referring a valid production
     contractor GFM requisition to the applicable SOS and of processing SOS
     rejects/cancellations of referred orders (referral would increase and reject/cancellation
     would decrease this quantity), it may also be manually file maintained by the MCA
     Account Manager if such action is the only way to ensure proper computation of the
     associated line item Open Quantity. Negative quantities in this field are created when
     Cancellation Reimbursement (SSSC automatic update of the Requisitioned quantity to
     adjust for status showing cancellation of quantities on orders previously referred to a
     SOS) is in excess of the Requisitioned quantity. See also paragraph 3.3.2.3 above.
     3.3.3.6. Requisition Quantity as of Date: Day/month/year the Requisition Quantity was
     last updated either mechanically or manually. SSSC mechanically derives this element
     for all line items.
     3.3.3.7. Open Quantity: Total number of assets ordered using the applicable contractor
     DoDAAC for specified NSN/NIIN on the noted contract. SSSC mechanically derives
     this element by subtracting the Requisition Quantity from the Authorized Quantity.
     Negative quantities in this field are created when overshipments are recorded in excess of
     the Authorized quantity.
     3.3.3.8. Status: The status column contains a dynamic visual representation of status of
     the line item. There are three possible values:

          3.3.3.8.1. A green checkmark means the line item is active and has no issues.
          3.3.3.8.2. A yellow exclamation point means the line item is active, and there is a
          quantity issue. (The requisitioned quantity is either negative or greater than the
          authorized quantity).
          3.3.3.8.3. A red letter “X” means the line item is currently cancelled.
3.4. Requisition Processing.
   3.4.1. Production contractor requisitions for GFM will be submitted in MILSTRIP format
   showing data as reflected on Table 3.2. Note: At no time is it appropriate for production
   contractors to order government-managed items directly from a government ICP. If total
   normal ADP systems execution and interface processing times would fail to satisfy an urgent
   requirement, AF contractors are authorized to use the following expedite procedures:
       3.4.1.1. For a GFM item managed by an AFMC wholesale IM, AF contractors can use
       telecom, E-mail, facsimile (FAX), etc. to request the applicable MCA Account Manager
       of the associated production contract input the requisition directly into SSSC. No further
       expedited system processing is needed or possible as the interfaces between and the
       processing within SSSC and D035A are real-time. After completion of the two-tiered
       MCA validation process (initial and with the exchange of AX1/AX2 ICP and GFM
       validation transactions between the ICP and the MCA), expedite for order fulfillment
       takes place outside of the MCA process.
       3.4.1.2. For a GFM item managed by other than an AFMC wholesale IM, AF contractors
       can use telecom, E-mail, FAX, etc. to request the applicable MCA account manager of
       the associated production contract to input the requisition directly into SSSC.
          3.4.1.2.1. The SSSC Lead Functional OPR will maintain a current list of those
          personnel having authority to request DLA wholesale IMs to input AF contractor
          GFM requisitions directly into the applicable DLA wholesale requisition supply
          processing system. This listing will be provided to the local DLA representative.
          3.4.1.2.2. The MCA account manager (or whoever has been identified to the local
          SSSC Site OPR as having authority to do so) will use telecom, E-mail, FAX, etc. to
          request the non-AFMC wholesale IM input AF contractor GFM requisitions directly
          into the non-AFMC wholesale requisition supply processing system. This request
          must also grant the non-AFMC IM authority to manually update their system to
          process as if it had received back from the MCA a positive GFM validation response
          (DIC AX2) for the total ordered quantity (see paragraph 3.5 for details of the
          automated process). After completion of the two-tiered MCA validation process
          (initial and with the exchange of DIC AX1/AX2 validation transactions between the
          ICP and the MCA), expedite for order fulfillment takes place outside of the MCA
          process.

   3.4.3. Requisitions for GFM will be subject to NSN edits, as well as other common SSSC
   edits. In addition, requisitions will be compared to the valid contract/ contractor table to
   validate the following data: Contractor DoDAAC, CSN, NSN/NIIN and Authorized
   Quantity.
       3.4.3.1. Orders received for maps, charts and geospatial products will be rejected back to
       the requisitioner using status code CA and a narrative advising customers to submit a
       requisition with a new document number directly to SOS RIC HM8. See DLA
       policy/procedures at http://www.aviation.dla.mil/rmf/.
       3.4.3.2. Requisitions passing all edits will be mechanically referred to the SOS via DIC
       A4_ referral order (see Table 3.5 for a referral order record layout).
       3.4.3.3. Requisitions failing these edits may be suspended on controlled exception for
       manual review (see Chapter 5 for processing instructions). Requisitions failing these
       edits may also be rejected using standard MILSTRIP cancellation/reject codes (see
       Chapter 6 for applicable codes).
       3.4.3.4. SSSC does not edit to verify whether a contractor is authorized to order using a
       Mission Capability (MICAP) designation. This edit is performed within the SOS
       wholesale IM requisition processing system (D035A). If the requisitioned item is
       AFMC-managed, D035A receives the referral order, checks whether or not the contractor
       DoDAAC is on a specific table as having authority to requisition materiel using MICAP
       designation. If the contractor DoDAAC is not on this table, the MICAP designation is
       removed from the applicable requisition.

   3.4.4. Special edits are performed against the requisition SUPADD field.
      3.4.4.1. If the requisition contains a supplementary address with the letter “Y” followed
      by a valid CSN, the system continues processing as normal.
      3.4.4.2. If the requisition contains a valid DoDAAC in the supplementary address field,
      the system continues processing as normal, looking for the CSN in rps 69 + 73-76. If no
      valid CSN is found in rp 69 + 73-76, SSSC suspends the order on a type “93” controlled
      exception (see Chapter 5 for processing instructions).
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                                    31


      3.4.4.3. If the requisition contains a supplementary address with the letter “Y” followed
      by an invalid CSN, the system suspends the order on a type “93” controlled exception
      (see Chapter 5 for processing instructions).
      3.4.4.4. If the requisition contains either an invalid DoDAAC or blanks in the
      supplementary address field, the system continues processing as normal, looking for the
      CSN in rps 69 + 73-76. If no valid CSN is found in rp 69 + 73-76, SSSC suspends the
      order on a type “93” controlled exception (see Chapter 5 for processing instructions).
   3.4.5. Requisitions for NSNs/NIINs not on the applicable SSSC GFM contract master record
   will be suspended as controlled exceptions (see Chapter 5 for processing instructions).
   3.4.6. Part number requisitions will not be accepted in SSSC as current guidance mandates
   production contracts authorizing use of GFM must be written to identify specific
   NSNs/NIINs and quantities the contractor is allowed to order.
3.5. Additional MCA Validation Processing.
   3.5.1. Once the referral order is received by the SOS, it is suspended and an ICP GFM
   validation request (DIC AX1) is automatically sent back to SSSC.
   3.5.2. SSSC checks to see if it had previously processed a requisition with the document
   number found in the AX1 transaction (see Table 3.6 for DIC AX1 record layout).
      3.5.2.1. If the document number does not match any document number already
      processed by SSSC, the system generates a notice to the applicable MCA account
      manager (see Chapter 5 for processing instructions).
      3.5.2.2. If the document number does match a document number already processed by
      SSSC, the system compares the quantity in the referral order to the quantity in the
      validation request and returns a MCA GFM validation response (DIC AX2) back to the
      SOS with an applicable MCA validation status code (see Table 3.7 for DIC AX2 record
      layout). Note: If SSSC never received DIC AX1 validation request or there is a need to
      send an additional “AX2” MCA GFM validation response, the applicable MCA account
      manager can cause SSSC to generate DIC AX2 using the “GFM Validation” page online
      in SSSC. This function is only operable if SSSC has already processed the applicable
      requisition. One of the following validation response status codes will be reflected in the
      “AX2” transaction outbound back to the SOS: 2M, 2Q, 2R, 2U, and 2V.

       3.6.3.2. The SOS generates transactions having DIC AS8 (shipment status) to DAAS.
       DAAS breaks out the DIC AS8 transactions as “AS1” transactions going to the
       requisitioner (or DIC AS2 transactions going to the activity identified in the
       supplementary address) and as “AS3” transactions going to M024B. M024B converts
       DIC AS3 transactions to “AS4” transactions before sending them to SSSC. See Table
       3.10 for DIC AS4 transaction record layout.

Note 1: WEBREQ (Web Requisitioning) was developed to generate requisitions through the
World Wide Web. It allows the customer to get immediate confirmation from DAAS on line.
Note 2: DIELOG provides users the capability to send and receive MILS transactions, via their
established E-mail) system. DIELOG is recommended for low data volume customers who do
not have dial-up (modem) or Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) access
capability.
Note 3: WEBVLIPS (Web Visual Logistics Information Processing System) is a DLA-
maintained application that displays information regarding transactions that process through one
of the two DAAS locations. To get access to WEBVLIPS, register at the following Website:
https://www.daas.dla.mil/sar/warning.asph. Once registered, you can check transaction
information on requisitions (regardless of SOS) by going to the website identified to you upon
registration acceptance.
Note 4: D035A is the AF/Marine Corps IMWRP system. To get access to D035A, see your
D035A local OPR.
Note 5: GSA erroneously assumes that all contractor requisitions have been previously
validated by the applicable service MCA, so they currently neither generate DIC AX1
transactions back to or expect DIC AX2 transactions back from the MCA.
   3.6.4. Out of Balance Indicators (OOBI). SSSC expects to receive updated supply and
   shipment status from DoD SOSs to which AF contractor GFM orders have previously been
   referred. OOBIs are set for individual AF contractor GFM orders whenever transactions are
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                                    45


  processed that cause the actioned quantity to differ from the total quantity ordered. As
  shown in the “Shipment Details” area of the applicable “Requisition Status and
  Maintenance” page, the actioned quantity is the sum of the “Shipped Quantity,” “Cancelled
  Quantity” and “Open Quantity.” No “Closed Date” can be assigned for orders that are out-
  of-balance. Orders having no “Closed Date” cannot be moved from active to archived files.
  This situation could potentially “grow” active databases in such a way as to adversely affect
  system performance. Note: OOBIs do not appear on any SSSC page; however, it is possible
  to interrogate for orders reflecting OOBIs by running a Discoverer query using the SCS View
  Rqstn_Dtl_001 Table.
     3.6.4.1. SSSC users may elect to prompt the system to generate an automated follow-up
     request for status from the SOS to whom the order was previously referred. On the
     “Requisition Status and Maintenance” page for the applicable order, the user simply
     clicks once on the “Followup” button found toward the bottom of the screen. The
     resulting outbound follow-up transaction triggers the SOS to provide SSSC with current
     status for the total quantity in the original referral order. This process applies to orders
     for both AFMC-managed and non-AFMC-managed items. Note: If SSSC had not
     previously received status from the designated SOS, the system will generate a follow-up
     with DIC AT_, which the SOS may interpret as a new requisition.
     3.6.4.2. Frequent data synchronization between SSSC and D035A provides an additional
     opportunity for maintaining valid information in SSSC. This process applies only to
     orders for AFMC-managed items
     3.6.4.3. Those having SSSC Site and HQ OPR access have the ability to manually close
     certain document number/suffix/sequence number records so that the most accurate
     supply/shipment status is reflected for that order. This process applies only to orders for
     non AFMC-managed items (e.g., DLA and GSA).
         3.6.4.3.1. On the “Requisition Status and Maintenance” page for the applicable order,
         the SSSC OPR would first click the “Close Record” button for the document
         number/suffix/sequence number row to be changed and then scroll down to the
         bottom of the page. The “Quantity” field in the record closure area of the page would
         have automatically been adjusted to equal the total quantity that could be closed for
         the selected row.
         3.6.4.3.2. The OPR would next select the record closure status from the “Status”
         drop-down menu (see Table 3.15 for authorized values), adjust the “Quantity” to the
         actual quantity being closed, adjust the “Action Date” if a more appropriate date is
         known and click the “Close Record” button. Note: The quantity for which record
         closure action is taken is no longer considered when computing a “Closed Date” for
         the order.

       3.6.4.4. If automated update or the use of “Close Record” procedures are successful in
       resolving OOBIs against contractor GFM orders, SSSC Site and HQ AFMC/A4 OPRs
       are authorized to request manual intervention through the sustainment contractor Help
       Desk. This direction applies to orders for both AFMC and non AFMC-managed items.
          3.6.4.4.1. Requests for assistance will include order information as found in the
          Tracker system accessible at https://tracker.wpafb.af.mil/.
          3.6.4.4.2. Sustainment contractor personnel will either post missing transaction data
          or adjust database values to most accurately reflect the current state of the applicable
          order. If the SOS shipped either more or less than the originally requested quantity
          and no other more appropriate documentation is possible, the original order quantity
          will be adjusted and the increased/decreased quantity will be recorded as an over
          shipment/under shipment” in the “Outbound and Miscellaneous Transactions” box
          within the “Action/Shipment History” section of the applicable “Requisition Status
          and Maintenance” page.
3.7. Contract Cancellation/Resurrection and Record Delete/Undelete.
   3.7.1. Contract Cancellation.
       3.7.1.1. SSSC users can use the “Production Contract Maintenance” page to manually
       change the termination date to reflect current date or a date prior to current date. SSSC
       will automatically either reject or suspend on controlled exceptions for manager review
       any requisitions with a document number date (rp 36-39) after the contract termination
       date.
       3.7.1.2. Cancelled contracts can only be viewed using Discoverer to query data found in
       the Cntrctr_001 and Cntrct_001 databases. HQ and Site SSSC OPRs have access to
       queries titled “Cancelled Contracts by SDC” and “Line Items on Type A Cancelled
       Contracts” to assist in finding cancelled contracts and their associated line items. On
       cancelled production contracts, only those associated line items cancelled prior to
       cancellation of the entire contract will reflect a cancellation date.
   3.7.2. Contract Resurrection. To resurrect a production contract, the site SSSC OPR must
   submit a request through the Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) Help Desk. Resurrected

   contracts are visible to the user online in SSSC via the “Contractor Data and Contract
   Maintenance” pages. Both active and cancelled line items are displayed.
   3.7.3. Record Delete. If an NSN/NIIN has erroneously been file maintained as being
   authorized against a production contract, delete it. The NSN is deleted as follows: access the
   “Production Contract Maintenance” page for the applicable contract, find the record with the
   applicable NSN/NIIN, click the field labeled “Delete” for that record then click the “Submit”
   button at the bottom of the page. Update to remove this NSN is immediate.
   3.7.4. Record Undelete. To undelete an individual line item, the user simply accesses the
   “Production Contract Maintenance” page for the desired active contract and proceeds as
   follows: find the applicable line item, change the authorized quantity and/or requisitioned
   quantity as needed, remove the checkmark from the “Delete” field and click the “Submit”
   button at the bottom of the page.
3.8. Output Products. SSSC users can request standardized reports related to production
contractor GFM requisitions and contracts (see Chapter 7 for specifics).

                                           Chapter 4

                               AGGREGATION PROCESSES

4.1. Overview. This chapter details SSSC use for aggregation of assets to: support site
activation of new weapon systems, frustrate selected FMS cargo, and support special projects.
   4.1.1. For aggregation accounts, this chapter includes information pertinent to requisition
   processing, file maintenance, receipts, reversals, disposal, denials, confirmations, follow-ups
   and stock levels.
   4.1.2. Other chapters in this volume provide additional aggregation account-related
   procedures: For SSSC access, key data elements, table records, online assistance, record
   retention and contingency planning, see Chapter 2; for controlled exceptions and notices,
   see Chapter 5; and for output products, see Chapter 7.
   4.1.3. Limits. Materiel Utilization Control Office (MUCO) and specialized aggregation
   accounts will only be used when standard supply procedures do not adequately provide an
   appropriate level of asset control requiring increased management. Cost/benefit analyses
   typically show aggregation to be a preferred control of materiel distribution method.
       4.1.4.1. MUCO Accounts. DoDAACs FN2029 (OO ICP), FN2030 (OC ICP) and
       FN2060 (WR ICP) apply to MUCO accounts. AFLCMC/HNC is not yet a user of SSSC
       and has no MUCO DoDAAC assigned for aggregation purposes.
          4.1.4.1.1. Purpose Code “A” General Aggregation. These represent generic “catch-
          all” accounts, sometimes previously used to erroneously prevent assets from being
          automatically redistributed by D035A. This is not an approved stand-alone use for
          any aggregation account. Assets placed in purpose code “A” in any MUCO account
          cannot be readily identified to any specific program or project, especially if multiple
          items with the same NSN are in the same account for different reasons.
          4.1.4.1.2. Ownership Code 8 FMS Frustrated Cargo (FFC) Aggregation. Under
          unusual and compelling circumstances, certain strategic, tactical or political
          considerations may require emergency suspension or cancellation of the provision of
          materiel to particular countries. There is potential for AFMC IMs to be instructed to
          divert assets from delivery against an existing FMS Customer Sales Order (CSO) to
          the suspended country instead to an AFMC depot for placement in an ownership code
          8 MUCO account. The AFMC chain of command for suspending provision of
          materiel to a foreign country begins with the US State Department determination to
          do so and proceeds as follows:
              4.1.4.1.2.1. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) issues
              instructions to Deputy Under Secretary of the AF for International Affairs
              (SAF/IA); reference DSCA Manual 5105.38-M, Security Assistance Manual
              (SAMM).
              4.1.4.1.2.2. SAF/IA provides implementing guidance regarding the degree or
              scope of suspension (e.g., temporary, partial, complete cut-off, etc.) to the
              applicable AFLCMC FMS country manager. Reference AFMAN 16-101,
              International Affairs and Security Assistance Management, and AFMCMAN 20-
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                                   49


            2, Security Assistance Program (SAP) Logistics Procedures (when published), for
            additional information.
            4.1.4.1.2.3. The applicable AFLCMC country manager provides implementing
            guidance to AFLCMC/WFN.
            4.1.4.1.2.4. If implementing guidance includes a determination to use one or
            more of the SSSC ownership code 8 MUCO accounts to aggregate FFC,
            AFLCMC/WFN will advise the SSSC Lead Functional System OPR.
            4.1.4.1.2.5. The SSSC Lead Functional/System OPR provides implementing
            guidance to each applicable ICP SSSC Functional/System OPR and the D035A
            Lead System OPR and for the D035K Lead System OPR (AFSC/LG). Either the
            SSSC Lead Functional System OPR or a D035A Lead System OPR provides
            implementing instructions to affected D035A Site System OPRs (AFSC/LG).
            The SSSC Lead Functional System OPR also informs the HQ AFMC/A4 focal
            point for FMS issues regarding the suspension of providing materiel to the
            specified foreign country.
            4.1.4.1.2.6. The ICP SSSC Functional System OPRs provide implementing
            guidance to the local MUCO account manager and the D035A Site System OPRs
            provide implementing guidance to each affected IM.
            4.1.4.1.2.7. The same chain of command will be used to advise affected parties
            regarding final disposition of property aggregated as frustrated cargo. Disposition
            instructions might include: re-shipment to the formerly suspended FMS customer,
            sale to another customer, disposal, etc.
        4.1.4.1.3. Purpose Code “H” Production Contractor Aggregation. Purpose code “H”
        MUCO accounts were at one time used to segregate assets held for “free-issue” to
        production contractors via requisitions containing purpose code H. This operated as
        the precursor to current MCA processing for Production Contractor GFM orders (see
        Chapter 3).
     4.1.4.2. Specialized Accounts. DoDAACs beginning with “FW” apply to specialized
     aggregation accounts. Traditionally, assets in these type aggregation accounts were
     funded and are now owned by a specified PMO. Usually, PMOs request collocation of
     assets for future “transfer-at-no-cost” delivery to bases as spares to support a new weapon
     system.
        4.1.4.2.1. Nonconsumable Item Materiel Support Code (NIMSC) “5.” In the joint
        service arena, DoD implemented procedures to eliminate the duplicate wholesale
        inventory management of recoverable items (i.e., investment or nonconsumable
        items). The Primary Inventory Control Activity (PICA) is assigned the responsibility
        for the logistics functions of single submitter cataloger, procurement and disposal
        authority, and usually is also assigned the depot maintenance responsibility. The
        PICA also performs wholesale stock, store and issue functions as well as budgets and
        funds for wholesale stock level requirements on those items having NIMSC “5”
        assigned. The Secondary Inventory Control Activity (SICA) is assigned the
        responsibility to provide a Requirements Data Exchange List to the PICA and to
 50                                                       AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014


          budget and fund for retail spares for the NIMSC “5” items.         The SICA is not
          authorized to maintain assets in wholesale inventory.
          4.1.4.2.2. FMS Not Treated as Frustrated Cargo. There exists one-per-ICP
          specialized aggregation accounts previously established specifically to provide for
          collection of pre-funded FMS materiel. Although there remains little-to-no use of
          these accounts, ICP focal points perceive future requirements may arise; so, these
          accounts will remain active until further notice.
4.2. Specialized Aggregation Account Establishment.
   4.2.1. Establishing Fund Code, DoDAAC, RIC, SDC and MDC. The activity desiring to
   establish a specialized aggregation account (aka requestor) must work through one of the ICP
   SSSC OPRs. The requestor would probably find it best to contact the SSSC OPR at the ICP
   which has management oversight for the weapon system for which materiel is to be
   aggregated; otherwise, the requestor may choose to work with the SSSC OPR at the closest
   ICP or at the ICP with which the requestor has familiarity based on past dealings. The ICP
   SSSC OPR will coordinate with other ICP personnel to identify who will act as the
   applicable Aggregation Account Manager (AAM). Once this AAM is identified, account
   establishment takes the following chronological path:
      4.2.1.1. The requestor provides the applicable AAM a meaningful description regarding
      the intended use of the aggregation account and identity of the applicable two-character
      requisitioning fund code. If the requestor does not have a fund code, contact the fund
      code representative within the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) to
      obtain one. The AAM will later use this fund code on behalf of the requestor to order
      materiel for placement in the new aggregation account.
      4.2.1.2. The AAM will provide the local SSSC Site Functional OPR the fund code and
      account description. The local SSSC Site Functional OPR will request the SSSC Lead
      Functional OPR to establish an aggregation account tied to the specified fund code and
      for the stated purpose.
      4.2.1.3. The SSSC Lead Functional OPR will:
          4.2.1.3.1. Work with the Lead for AF DoDAAC assignment to establish a unique
          “FW” DoDAAC and RIC for the new account. These codes must be recognizable to
          such interfacing systems as follows (list is not intended to be all-inclusive): DAAS;
          DSS; D035A; D035J; D035K; and the Shipping Information Shipping (SIS) system
          (D035T).
          4.2.1.3.2. Assign an SDC and a SSSC AAM MDC for the new account.
          4.2.1.3.3. Generate a DR, SCM or Computer Systems Requirements Document
          (CSRD) through proper channels to change SSSC to recognize the new codes.
          4.2.1.3.4. Inform the SSSC Site Functional OPR when the new aggregation account
          is available for use. Note: Months can pass between request for account
          establishment and its actual availability dependent upon existence of funding and
          competing requirements for updates to SSSC.
      4.2.1.4. The SSSC Site Functional OPR will advise the AAM that the new account is
      available for use.
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                                 51


  4.2.2. AAM File Maintenance.
     4.2.2.1. The assigned AAM for either the MUCO or specialized account must maintain
     an account folder which provides significant information regarding the account.
     Pertinent data includes: written requests by account customers (i.e., PMO) for use of an
     aggregation account; Requestor POCs (name/office symbol/phone number/E-mail
     address); a meaningful description regarding the intended use of the aggregation account;
     approximate begin and end dates for use of the account to meet the intended purpose;
     DoDAACs of end customers authorized to order materiel out of the aggregation account;
     a list of quantities by NSN for which each end customer is authorized to order materiel
     out of the aggregation account; a copy of any Purchase Request/Military
     Interdepartmental Purchase Request (PR/MIPR) and contract used to bring assets into an
     aggregation account; and documentation that PO receipt acknowledgement was furnished
     to the pertinent SOS IAW paragraph 4.7.1.2.2.
     4.2.2.2. Check NSNs in SCS Midtier. Each NSN for which materiel is to be aggregated
     must be recognized by the SCS Midtier of which SSSC is a part. The AAM must check
     each NSN using the “Master Item Data” page as follows: access SSSC, click the ITEMS
     button and select “Master Item Data” from the drop-down menu; on the “Master Item
     Data” page, fill in the “NSN/NIIN” field and click the “Find” button. If the system
     displays an Information Message with text “NSN/NIIN is unknown,” the AAM must
     create an item record for unrecognized NSNs by following instructions found in Chapter
     2.
     4.2.2.3. Associate Items to be Aggregated. To associate applicable NSNs with the new
     SDC assigned to that account, access SSSC, click the “Items” button and select “SSSC
     Items Data” from the drop-down menu. On the displayed page, type an NSN/NIIN in the
     box so-labeled and click the ASSIGN button. Each NSN/NIIN must be input one-at-a-
     time. Input the following values on the displayed “Assign SSSC Codes” page and click
     the “Submit” button:
        4.2.2.3.1. SDC – a mandatory two-character numeric code assigned by the SSSC
        Lead Functional OPR to identify the applicable aggregation account for transaction
        processing.
        4.2.2.3.2. MDC – a three-character code assigned either by the SSSC Lead
        Functional OPR (for specialized aggregation accounts) or mechanically by SSSC with
        “$” (dollar sign) followed by the account SDC (for MUCO accounts) to identify a
        person or organization responsible for the account. Only those user profiles which
        list this MDC allow those users access to this aggregation account.
        4.2.2.3.3. Manager Review Code (MRC) – Use of a SSSC MRC will cause all
        inbound CSOs against the aggregation account to go backorder with status code B5.
        See Chapter 6 for further details.
        4.2.2.3.4. “SSSC Manager Review [Text]” – a narrative explanation intended to
        clarify the reason for MRC assignment. The system allows for input of up to 2000
        characters. Note: Any NSN/NIIN assigned to an aggregation account having an
        SSSC MRC reflects MRC text.
52                                                       AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014


        4.2.2.3.5. “Do Not Refer” Characteristics – allows or prevents the system from
        issuing a referral order to the prime wholesale IM. Checking this box prevents issuing
        of the referral order action and will most likely result in incoming CSOs being placed
        on backorder. Not checking this box allows the referral order action to take place.
     4.2.2.4. Change Aggregation Account NSN/NIIN Details/Association. To change data
     for an NSN associated with an aggregation account, access SSSC, click the “Items”
     button and select “SSSC Items Data” page from the drop-down menu. On the “SSSC
     Items Data” page, type an NSN/NIIN in the box so-labeled and click the “Find” button.
     Each NSN/NIIN must be changed one-at-a-time. If the applicable NSN/NIIN is not
     associated with any aggregation account, the system will display an Information Message
     with text “No data was found for the given selection criteria” (see paragraph 5.2.2.3 for
     procedures to make initial association of an NSN/NIIN to an aggregation account). If
     “SSSC Item Data” is displayed, it will reflect a record for each SDC with which that
     NSN/NIIN is associated. Make one or more of the following inputs on the record with
     the desired SDC and click the “Submit” button:
        4.2.2.4.1. Modify MRC to blank out or replace the existing code with a different
        MRC or to insert a new MRC.
        4.2.2.4.2. Modify MRC Text by blanking out or rewriting existing information or
        inserting new text.
        4.2.2.4.3. Check or un-check the “Do Not Refer” box as appropriate. Receipt of a
        new CSO prompts SSSC to compare the new order quantity plus the quantities in
        open and previously-satisfied orders to the levels established for that item in the
        applicable aggregation account. If this combined order quantity does not exceed
        these levels, and if no MRC applies, and if insufficient assets are either on-hand or
        due-in to support the order, and if system edits described in paragraph 5.9.1.2 would
        normally cause the order to go on backorder, SSSC will apply logic behind the “Do
        Not Refer” box to the new CSO. If the box is un-checked, the order will be referred
        to the DoD SOS. If the box is checked, the new CSO will go on backorder.
        4.2.2.4.4. Check the “Delete” box only if the desired result is to disassociate the
        NSN/NIIN from the aggregation account altogether. This action is taken as necessary
        and is mandatory after the aggregation account is no longer authorized for use. Click
        “OK” in the resulting pop-up box with text “Delete this Item Data (row x) from the
        NSN/NIIN?” To reestablish the association between the aggregation account and the
        NSN/NIIN, the AAM must treat the NSN/NIIN as if it were brand new to the account
        (see paragraph 4.2.2.3).
     4.2.2.5. Customer Authorizations.     The AAM must ensure that the applicable
     aggregation account reflects only those DoDAACs and/or Service/Country Codes of
     customers authorized to order from that account. To obtain a list of which DoDAACs
     and Service/Country Codes are currently associated with a given aggregation account:
     access SSSC, click the “Organizations” button, select “Customer Authorization” from the
     drop-down menu, input the pertinent SDC and then click the “Find” button.
        4.2.2.5.1. To establish a new DoDAAC/Service/Country Code-to-SDC association:
        access SSSC, click the “Organizations” button, select “Customer Authorization” from
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                                 53


        the drop-down menu, input the pertinent SDC, and click the “New” button; on the
        “New Customer Authorization – SDC” page, input either a DoDAAC in the box next
        to the “New DoDAAC” field or a Service/Country Code in the box next to the “New
        Service/Country Code” field and click the “Submit” button. If the specified
        DoDAAC or Service/Country Code is already associated with the applicable SDC,
        the system will display an Information Message with text “Data already exists and
        must be updated rather than created as new.”
        4.2.2.5.2. To remove a DoDAAC/Service/Country Code-to-SDC association: access
        SSSC, click the “Organization” button, select “Customer Authorization” from the
        drop-down menu, input the pertinent SDC, and click the “Find” button; on the
        “Customer Authorization – SDC” page, check the box labeled “Delete” next to the
        DoDAACs and/or Service/Country Codes to be removed and click the “Submit”
        button. Click “Ok” in the resulting pop-up box with text “Warning: Proceeding with
        this action will remove the checked values.”
     4.2.2.6. Establish/Change Levels Data. For each NSN/NIIN authorized to be placed in
     an aggregation account, the applicable AAM can establish levels that either affect
     inbound CSOs or which the system uses to determine when to suggest the AAM take
     reorder action. To establish/change pertinent levels: access SSSC, click the “Levels”
     button and select “Levels” from the drop-down menu; on the “Levels Selection” page,
     input the applicable “FN” or “FW” DoDAAC associated with the aggregation account,
     input the NSN/NIIN to be actioned and click “Find” button; if the system displays an
     Information Message with text “No data was found for the given selection criteria,” use
     the “Browser Back” button to return to the “Levels Selection” page, and click the “New”
     button. Update the “Quantity” in the box next to those levels requiring change and click
     the “Submit” button. Each NSN/NIIN must be input one-at-a-time for each aggregation
     account. There is no need to adjust the Storage Site/RIC/Percent Stockage values as no
     functionality currently within SSSC exists that would make use of the information.
        4.2.2.6.1. As SSSC shares this page with the RAMP system, some fields on this page
        are not relative to SSSC. The following RAMP-peculiar data elements on this page
        will not be touched as part of establishing SSSC Aggregation Account levels:
        Readiness Spares Package (RSP), Demand, Recurring Issues, Retention, High
        Priority Mission Support Kit (HPMSK), Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized
        Maintenance (SPRAM) and Authorized Support.
        4.2.2.6.2. The following levels function as follows in relation to SSSC Aggregation
        Accounts. Some fields are also applicable to RAMP; however, the descriptions
        provided below reflect SSSC usage only:
            4.2.2.6.2.1. Requisitioning Objective (RO) – This nine-digit numeric from 0 to
            999,999,999 represents the maximum quantity that on-hand and/or on-order to
            sustain current operations of the applicable aggregation account. The quantity
            will not exceed the total number of assets required to support unfilled authorized
            CSOs for the given NSN/NIIN out of the applicable aggregation account.
            4.2.2.6.2.2. Reorder Point – This nine-digit numeric from 0 to 999,999,999
            represents the maximum stock position which, when breached, will signal to the
            AAM a need to submit either a funded requisition or a PR/MIPR to maintain the
 54                                                       AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014


             level of stock on-hand or due in to maintain the RO. Requisitions may be either
             routine or priority. For the applicable NSN/NIIN as it relates to the applicable
             aggregation account, SSSC uses the following formula to decide whether or not to
             generate a RO breach notice to the AAM recommending reorder of additional
             assets from the SOS: If ([on-hand serviceable assets + on-hand unserviceable
             assets + Reorder Point] <= [RO + Additive Level]) then calculate a due-in
             quantity by aggregation account and NSN/NIIN; If (on-hand serviceable assets +
             on-hand unserviceable assets + Reorder Point + due-in quantity) <= (RO +
             Additive Level) then generate the notice. SSSC will not automatically generate a
             reorder requisition on its own. There is currently no way to create a due-in record
             for assets being obtained through the PR/MIPR/Contract process; therefore, the
             system could repeatedly breach the Reorder Point until such materiel is receipted.
             AAMs must consider these other due-ins in any decision to order additional
             assets.
             4.2.2.6.2.3. Additive Level – This nine-digit numeric from 0 to 999,999,999
             represents the maximum authorized level over-and-above the RO and which
             figures in determining whether or not the Reorder Point for the NSN/NIIN in the
             applicable aggregation account has been breached. This field rarely reflects
             greater than zero for aggregation account processing as the allowance of
             999,999,999 in the RO would seem more than sufficient.
             4.2.2.6.2.4. Maximum Release [Quantity] – This nine-digit numeric from 0 to
             999,999,999 represents the maximum number of assets that will fill a single
             requisition. Current requisitioning formats limit each order to no more than
             99,999. Its purpose is to prevent premature depletion of aggregated stocks.
             4.2.2.6.2.5. Storage Site/RIC/Percent Stockage – This reflects the DoDAAC and
             RIC of each site storing assets for the applicable NSN/NIIN in the pertinent
             aggregation account. Each record also shows what percentage of the specified
             NSN/NIIN is authorized to be in that aggregation account at that storage location.
             Presumably, this information would be useful in triggering notification to the
             AAM to divert shipment away from a sufficiently-stocked location; however,
             current AFMC guidance does not permit storing items for a single aggregation
             account at multiple sites; so, the percent stocked remains unchanged.
4.3. Bringing Assets into Aggregation Accounts. There are multiple avenues available for
bringing assets into an aggregation account as described below:
   4.3.1. PR/MIPR/Contract Processing. Either the assigned wholesale IM or AAM may
   initiate a PR or MIPR to buy assets to be placed in the applicable aggregation account.
      4.3.1.1. Any resulting contract will direct shipment of assets to purpose code “A” of the
      designated account DoDAAC (e.g., FN2030, FW2027, etc.).
      4.3.1.2. There is no interface between SSSC and any due-in procurement system. There
      also currently exists no method to create a record in SSSC showing assets due-in from a
      contract established via the PR/MIPR process. As such, the AAM must document this
      due-in information by placing a copy of the PR/MIPR/contract in the applicable
      aggregation account folder.
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                               55


  4.3.2. MILSTRIP PO Processing. AAMs initiate POs to obtain assets from DoD SOSs for
  delivery into aggregation accounts. Authorized customers submit CSOs to request shipment
  of assets out of aggregation accounts. This process will be discussed in greater detail in
  paragraph 4.5.
     4.3.2.1. Initiate PO.
         4.3.2.1.1. Establish Document Number. The AAM must first establish the 14-
         character document number to be used in the PO. The document number is
         constructed as noted in Chapter 2. For each “FN” or “FW” aggregation account
         DoDAAC, the organization must maintain a separate Document Number Register.
         4.3.2.1.2. Input Order. The AAM must access SSSC, click the “Orders” button and
         select “Due In” from the drop-down menu; on the “Due-In” page, input the applicable
         “FN” or “FW” document number and NSN/NIIN in the appropriate fields and click
         the “New” button. On the “Outbound / Due In Requisition” page, input
         desired/required values IAW Table 4.1 and click the “Submit” button. SSSC will
         pass a funded requisition to the designated SOS using a DIC A0A transaction (see
         Table 4.2 for a record layout of outbound PO with DIC A0A).

         status back from the SOS, a DIC AF_ transaction will be sent to request current
         status; if SSSC has not previously received status back from the SOS, a DIC AT_
         transaction will be sent to request current status. The fields on the “Outbound/Due-In
         Order Modification” page will remain unchanged unless the SOS responds with
         supply status different than previously processed.
         4.3.2.2.3. The AAM can generate a request for an improved ESD from the SOS as
         follows: access SSSC, click the “Orders” button and select “Due In” from the drop-

        4.3.2.5. Materiel Obligation Validation (MOV) for POs. At the beginning of each
        quarter (January, April, July and October), DoD SOSs generate validation transactions
        with DIC AN_ for backordered requisitions that meet the priority/age criteria described in
        DLM 4000.25-1, Chapter 7, Paragraph C7.1.3 (see Table 4.8 for a record layout of an
        inbound MOV request transaction with DIC AN_). The SOS expects activities to which
        it has sent validation requests to return validation response transactions with the quantity
        still required (see Table 4.8 for a record layout of an outbound MOV request transaction
        with DIC AP_). Aggregation account due-in POs are subject to this validation.
           4.3.2.5.1. Due to fiscal and schedule constraints, SSSC was not designed to
           automatically respond to MOV requests. As such, SSSC will record inbound DIC
           AN_ transactions on an error log that is only accessible to AF users via a Discoverer
           query and only retained for two weeks after transaction processing. SSSC Site
           Functional OPRs have been given access to a query titled “AN_ Transactions in the
           Error Log” that will allow them to see these transactions. If there are due-in POs for
           aggregation accounts at the ICP, the SSSC Site Functional OPR must run this query
           periodically during the first four weeks of the quarter and provide the results to the
           applicable AAM.
           4.3.2.5.2. If none of the quantity reflected in the DIC AN_ transaction is still
           required, the AAM will submit cancellation action as described in paragraph 4.3.2.4.
           If any or all of the quantity reflected in the DIC AN_ transaction is still required, the
           AAM will request the SSSC Site Functional OPR have CSC generate an outbound
           DIC AP_ transaction using the format in Table 4.8 (see also DLM 4000.25-1,
           Appendix 3.29).

          cancels a quantity of 2). The SOS will also send SSSC DIC AE_ transaction with
          status code BR for the cancelled quantity. See paragraph 4.3.2.2.4 for details
          regarding SSSC processing of this cancellation status.
   4.3.3. Diversion of Frustrated Cargo to AFMC Depot Storage. For FFC, an appropriate
   authority directs shipment of assets against existing FMS CSOs instead to ownership code 8
   within one of three MUCO accounts. For those assets scheduled to be delivered directly
   from a repair or production contractor, the MUCO AAM must advise each applicable
   wholesale IM to have the assets instead shipped to the AFMC depot storage site with the
   following information noted on the shipping ticket:
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                                    65


      4.3.3.1. “Ship To” DoDAAC = SW3211 for OC, or SW3210 for OO, or SW3119 for
      WR. For storage of items that require special handling such as munitions, it is likely that
      the Ship to DoDAAC would need to be negotiated prior to shipment.
      4.3.3.2. “Mark For” MUCO Account DoDAAC (FN2030 for OC, or FN2029 for OO, or
      FN2060 for WR); ownership code 8; FFC.
   4.3.4. Reclamation or Recovery from Davis-Monthan AFB. An AFMC wholesale IM
   directs shipment of assets to purpose code “A” within MUCO or specialized aggregation
   accounts with the following noted on the shipping ticket:
      4.3.4.1. “Ship To” DoDAAC = SW3211 for OC, or SW3210 for OO, or SW3119 for
      WR.
      4.3.4.2. “Mark For” DoDAAC (see Table 4.25 for valid DoDAACs) and purpose code
      “A.”
4.4. Receipt and Inventory Processing.
   4.4.1. Receipt Processing. Receipts processed by SSSC can be tied to three unique sources:
   delivery of contract procurement, receipts against MILSTRIP POs, and diversion of FMS
   FFC.
      4.4.1.1. Delivery of Contract Procurement (D4_). The designated AFMC depot receives
      materiel and posts to DSS a receipt transaction with DIC D4_ and the applicable contract
      number. DSS forwards a copy of this receipt transaction to D035K. D035K sends a copy
      of this receipt transaction to SSSC. Except for those assets being placed in ownership
      code 8 of the local MUCO account, SSSC sends a copy of this receipt to D035J. See
      Table 4.9 for record layouts of a “D4_” transaction inbound from D035K and a “D4_”
      transaction outbound to D035J.

                             most common choice).
                             Note: Although SSSC recognizes “H” (Reserved for Government
                             Furnished Material) as a valid purpose code, D035K does not.
                             Therefore, assets may be receipted into SSSC in purpose code
                             “H,” but must currently be moved to purpose code “A” prior to
                             release for shipment.
*Condition                   Use the drop-down menu to select the appropriate SCC of the
                             receipted property (“A – Serviceable Issuable Without
                             Qualification” is the most common choice).
*Release [Receipt] Date      Use the drop-down menu to select the appropriate month and then
                             type in the correct two-digit day and four-digit year of the actual
                             receipt date.
       4.4.1.2. Receipt Against MILSTRIP POs (DIC D6_). The designated AFMC depot
       receives materiel and posts a receipt transaction with DIC D6_ to DSS. DSS forwards a
       copy of this receipt transaction to D035K. D035K sends a copy of this receipt transaction
       to SSSC. Although this receipt “FN” or “FW” document number is the same as for the
       original PO, SSSC processing of the receipt has no impact on the PO detail record which
       is instead updated as noted in paragraph 4.5.2.2 Except for those assets being placed in
       ownership code 8 of the local MUCO account, SSSC sends a copy of this receipt to
       D035J. See Table 4.11 for record layout of DIC D6_ transaction inbound from D035K
       and outbound to D035J.

           4.4.1.2.2. Due to fiscal and schedule constraints, SSSC was not designed to
           automatically generate DIC DRA (materiel receipt acknowledgement) transactions
           back to a DoD SOS for use in closing their release order records. As such, upon
           receipt of assets associated with an aggregation account due-in PO, the AAM must
           take offline action to provide this information to the SOS as follows:
               4.4.1.2.2.1. If AFMC is the SOS, the AAM must advise the wholesale IM in
               writing (e.g., E-mail, letter, Faxed printout of SSSC “Manual Government
               Receipt Data” page, etc.) that assets the AAM purchased from the AFMC
               wholesale IM have been received. A copy of this notification must be placed in
               the aggregation account folder. The AFMC wholesale IM can then manually post
               DIC DRA using the “AUXC” screen in D035A. See Volume 1, Chapter 13 for
               procedures.
               4.4.1.2.2.2. If SOS is other than AFMC, the AAM must request the SSSC Site
               Functional OPR have CSC generate outbound DIC DRA transaction using the
               format shown in Table 4.13 (see also DLM 4000.25-2, Appendix 3.29). A copy
               of this notification must be placed in the aggregation account folder.

               applicable SOS.
        4.4.1.3. Diversion of FFC to AFMC Depot Storage (DIC D6_). Receipt of FFC provides
        for visibility of on-hand assets and creates what can best be described as a due-out detail
        record useful not only in identifying the country owner but also in exercising future
        alternate disposition instructions. The designated AFMC depot receives materiel and

          4.4.1.3.1. Because AFMC does not actually own this FFC, SSSC does not send a
          copy of this receipt to D035J.
          4.4.1.3.2. Because this mechanically processed receipt does not contain a distribution
          code, the AAM must modify any resulting due-in detail record to add the distribution
          code either at time of receipt or at time of release for re-shipment as follows:
              4.4.1.3.2.1. Access SSSC, click the “Assets” button and select “FMS Balances”
              from the drop-down menu.
              4.4.1.3.2.2. On the “FMS Balances” page, type in the pertinent aggregation
              account “DoDAAC” and “NSN/NIIN” in the applicable boxes and click the
              “Find” button. The “FMS Balances” page will re-display with data matching the
              selection criteria. Select the radio button for the row that contains the document
              number of the receipt to be modified and click the “View Details” button.
              4.4.1.3.2.3. Scroll down the “FMS Asset Detail” page and input the appropriate
              value in the “Distribution Code” field as provided in the original FMS CSO and
              click the “Modify” button. SSSC will re-display the “FMS Asset Detail” page
              reflecting the modified Distribution Code.
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                              75


       4.4.1.3.3. If SSSC does not receive a copy of a receipt transaction (e.g., munitions
       items stored at OO ICP are recorded in the Combat Ammunition Storage (CAS)
       system which does not feed these receipts to D035K and in turn to SSSC), the AAM
       can post the receipt manually as follows:
          4.4.1.3.3.1. Access SSSC, click the “Assets” button and select “FMS Receipt”
          from the drop-down menu.
          4.4.1.3.3.2. On the “FMS Receipt” page, input the “FN” MUCO aggregation
          account “DoDAAC” and the applicable “NSN/NIIN” and click the “New” button.

   4.4.2. Receipt Reversal Processing. If materiel was receipted in error (e.g., erroneous
   quantity), the AAM will work with local focal points (i.e., D035A System OPR, D035K
   System OPR, AFMC Wholesale IM, local DLA Distribution Site, DLA Customer Support
   Specialist [CSS], DSS POC) to reverse erroneous receipts in DSS and D035K, and to post
   corrected receipt transactions as needed. Receipt reversals processed in D035K cause similar
   reversals in SSSC. For receipts properly reversed in DSS and D035K, but not forwarded to
   SSSC, the AAM can perform those reversals as follows:
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                                   77


     4.4.2.1. Contract Procurement (D4_) Reversal. AAM accesses SSSC, clicks the
     “Assets” button and selects “Manual Receipt From Contract” from the drop-down menu.
     On the “Manual Receipt From Contract” page, input the applicable contract number in
     the “Procurement Instrument” field, input the applicable NSN/NIIN in the “NSN/NIIN”
     field and click the “Find” button. On the “Manual Receipt from Contract Data” page,
     select the radio button for the row of receipt information to be reversed. If less than the
     total receipt quantity is going to be reversed, change the value in the “Reversible
     Quantity” field to the quantity to be reversed and click the “Reverse” button. The system
     will display a user interface dialogue box with text, “Warning: Proceeding with this
     action will commit a reversal to the selected record.” Click the “Ok” button. The system
     will display a “Processing Successful” message with text, “The desired function has been
     processed and the database has been successfully updated.”
     4.4.2.2. MILSTRIP PO (DIC D6_) Reversal. AAM access SSSC, click the “Assets”
     button and select “Manual Government Receipt” from the drop-down menu. On the
     “Manual Government Receipt Data” page, input the applicable PO number in the
     “Document Number” field, input the applicable NSN/NIIN in the “NSN/NIIN” field and
     click the “Find” button. The “Manual Government Receipt Data” page will be displayed.
     Select the radio button for the row of receipt information to be reversed. If less than the
     total receipt quantity is to be reversed, change the value in the “Reversible Quantity”
     field to the quantity to be reversed. Click the “Reverse” button. The system will display
     a user interface dialogue box with text, “Warning: Proceeding with this action will
     commit a reversal to the selected record.” Click the “Ok” button. The system will
     display a “Processing Successful” message with text, “The desired function has been
     processed and the database has been successfully updated.”
     4.4.2.3. FFC (DIC D6_) Reversal. AAM access SSSC, click the “Assets” button and
     select “FMS Receipt” from the drop-down menu. On the “FMS Receipt” page, input the
     applicable “FN” MUCO aggregation account DoDAAC in the “DoDAAC” field, input
     the applicable NSN/NIIN in the designated field and click the “Find” button. On the
     “FMS Receipt Data” page, select the radio button for the row of receipt information to be
     reversed. Reversals for partial quantity cannot be processed. Click the “Reverse” button
     to reverse the entire receipt quantity. The system will display a user interface dialogue
     box with text, “Warning: Proceeding with this action will commit a reversal to the
     selected record.” Click the “Ok” button. The system will display a “Processing
     Successful” message with text, “The desired function has been processed and the
     database has been successfully updated.”
  4.4.3. Inventory Processing. Aggregation account assets are visible online in SSSC. It is
  best to make needed adjustments to on-hand balances by reversing transactions with
  erroneous data and inputting new transactions with corrected information through DSS
  and/or D035K; however, it is possible to make these adjustments directly into SSSC through
  user interface. Note: Manual adjustments and reversals to adjustments of those balances
  visible in SSSC do not generate transactions to change those balances in either DSS or
  D035K. If asset balance records in either of these systems are incorrect, the AAM must work
  with DSS and D035K focal points to make necessary adjustments to those systems.

      transactions to either increase (DIC D8_) or decrease (DIC D9_) the on-hand quantity
      reflected for an item in an aggregation account when such an adjustment cannot be tied
      back to a specific receipt transaction for reversal (see Table 4.16 for record layouts of
      DIC D8_ and D9_ transactions inbound from D035K and outbound to D035J).

        automated reconciliation of non-FMS specialized and MUCO aggregation account
        balances with D035J. Three days before the end of each month, SSSC sends D035J a file
        of “ZCN” transactions formatted as seen in Table 4.19. D035J compares the data in
        these transactions to what it reflects for these same balances and makes adjustments to its
        records as needed.

4.5. Moving Assets Out of Aggregation Accounts. The standard method for removing assets
from aggregation accounts is via initiation of CSOs. There are five non-standard methods for
removing assets from aggregation accounts: initiate re-shipment of FFC; initiate ownership code
“H” AF production contractor CSOs; initiate Materiel Returns Program (MRP); issue to local
depot retail; and process shipment to disposal.
   4.5.1. CSO. Activities authorized to requisition assets from an aggregation account generate
   requisitions referred to in SSSC as “Sales Orders” even though shipment against these orders
   result in a transfer of property and no billing occurs. Payment for the items was made at the
   time assets were brought into the account (via PO or Contract Procurement) using funds
   belonging to the organization who initially requested the aggregation of assets (see
   paragraph 4.2).
        4.5.1.1. Initiate CSOs. CSOs can either be received as inbound from the customer
        ordering system through a chain of automated data routing systems (e.g., DAAS and
        M024B) or be input manually directly into SSSC via online user interface by the AAM.
        Customers are not authorized to access SSSC to input their orders against aggregation
        accounts.
           4.5.1.1.1. Inbound. Activities authorized to order assets aggregated in ownership
           code “A” of specialized and MUCO aggregation accounts (see paragraph 4.3.2.5)
           submit requisitions using the format in Table 4.20.

        Instructions
        4.5.1.2. Edit CSOs. SSSC will process new CSOs in one of five ways: suspension on
        controlled exception; backorder; rejection; referral to the DoD SOS; or release of assets
        for shipment. The system will also send the customer both initial and follow-on supply
        and shipment status (see Table 4.2 and Table 4.3 for DIC AE_ and AS_ transaction
        record layouts). The following is intended to be representative rather than all-inclusive of
        the many edits performed against new CSOs. The edits listed here will not address those
        considered to be standard and which are also applicable to MCA processing (e.g.,
        quantity must be all numeric, NSN is valid, document number is properly formatted,
        etc.). Additionally, these edits are not provided in any sequential order.
           4.5.1.2.1. Suspend CSO on Controlled Exception. CSOs requiring manual review by
           the applicable AAM become suspended as controlled exceptions. Examples of when
           SSSC would place these orders on controlled exception include: customer DoDAAC
           not authorized to order from the specified aggregation account; or alphabetic
           ownership code does not equal A or H. The AAM will use guidance provided in
           Chapter 5 to work these controlled exceptions in one of four ways: release for
           shipment; force on backorder; refer to SOS; or reject.
           4.5.1.2.2. Backorder CSO. CSOs may be placed on backorder. Examples of when
           SSSC would place these orders on backorder include: application of a restrictive
           MRC (status code B5 backorder action applies); or the “Do Not Refer” box is
           checked for the ordered item as it applies to the specified aggregation account and
           insufficient assets are on-hand or due-in to support the requirements. The AAM can
           action CSO backorders in one of four ways:
               4.5.1.2.2.1. Modify Backorder. As the result of discussion with the customer, the
               AAM may find it necessary to modify up to 11 different backorder data elements
               (M&S code, SUPADD, signal code, fund code, distribution code, project code,
               priority code, RDD, advice code, status code and Estimated Delivery Date
               [EDD]). There are two methods for modifying backorder information:
                   4.5.1.2.2.1.1. Using the “Requisition Status and Maintenance” page. The
                   AAM can access SSSC, click the “Orders” button and select “Requisition”
                   from the drop-down menu; on the “Requisition” page, fill in the “Document
                   Number” and click the “Find” button. On the “Requisition Status and
                   Maintenance” page, change up to nine modifiable data elements (M&S code,
                   SUPADD, signal code, fund code, distribution code, project code, priority
                   code, RDD, and advice code) and click the “Submit” button. The
                   “Requisition Status and Maintenance” page will re-display and reflect the new
                   values for the modified data elements.
                   4.5.1.2.2.1.2. Using the “Backorder List” Page. AAM access SSSC, click the
                   “Orders” button and select “Backorder” from the drop-down menu; on the
                   “Backorders” page, fill in either the “Document Number” or the “NSN/NIIN”
                   and “SDC” fields and click the “Find” button. On the “Backorder List” page,
                   select the radio button next to the row with the order to be modified and click
92                                                AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014


        the “Modify” button. On the “Modify Backorder” page, change up to three
        modifiable data elements (status code, RDD and ESD) and click the “Modify”
        button. The system will display a “Processing Successful Results” page with
        text, “The desired function has been processed and the database has been
        successfully updated.” Modified values can be seen by returning to the
        “Backorders” page, filling in the “Document Number” field and clicking on
        the “Find” button.
     4.5.1.2.2.2. Release Assets for Shipment. The AAM can release the total or a
     partial quantity of assets against a backorder as follows: access SSSC, click the
     “Orders” button and select “Backorder” from the drop-down menu; on the
     “Backorders” page, fill in either the “Document Number” or the “NSN/NIIN” and
     “SDC” fields and click the “Find” button; on the “Backorder List” page, select the
     radio button for the record with the backorder to be released for shipment and
     click the “Release” button; on the “Release Backorder” page, check the box for
     the record with the assets to be released, ensure that the value in the “Release
     Quantity” field is equal to the quantity that needs to be released, check the box
     labeled “Generate MRO/RDO to Storage” and click the “Release” button. SSSC
     will display an “Information Message” page with text, “Backorder released
     successfully. MRO has been generated.” See paragraph 4.5.1.2.5 for continued
     processing of a release for shipment.
     4.5.1.2.2.3. Refer Backorder to SOS. The AAM can refer the backorder to the
     DoD SOS. First, the procedures in paragraph 4.5.1.2.2.1.1 must be used to
     modify the signal code either from D to C or from M to L and modify the fund
     code to equal that established for the applicable aggregation account. To then
     refer this modified order to the DoD SOS, the AAM would take the following
     steps: access SSSC, click the “Orders” button, select “Backorder” from the drop-
     down menu, input the applicable backorder document number on the
     “Backorders” page and click the “Find” button; select the radio button next to the
     order with the document number/suffix combination to be referred and then click
     the “Pass” button. The system will display a “Processing Successful Results”
     page with text, “The desired function has been processed and the database has
     been successfully updated.”
     4.5.1.2.2.4. Cancel Backorder. The AAM can cancel the total or a partial
     quantity of assets against a backorder using one of two methods:
        4.5.1.2.2.4.1. Using the “Requisition Status and Maintenance” page. The
        AAM can access SSSC, click the “Orders” button and select “Requisition”
        from the drop-down menu; on the “Requisition” page, fill in the “Document
        Number” and click the “Find” button. On the “Requisition Status and
        Maintenance” page, click the “Cancel/Manual Warehouse Status” hyperlink in
        the “Additional Notes” area for the suffix code backorder record with the
        quantity to be totally or partially cancelled. On the “Cancel/Manual
        Warehouse Status” page, in the area just above the “Cancel” button, ensure
        that the value in the “Quantity” field is equal to the quantity that needs to be
        cancelled, select the appropriate cancellation status code from the
        “Cancellation Reason” drop-down menu, type in a narrative reason for
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                                   93


              cancellation action in the “Cancellation Reason Text” box (mandatory only if
              the cancellation reason is status code BQ or CA) and click the “Cancel”
              button. Click “Ok” in the resulting pop-up box with text “Warning: Do you
              want to cancel this quantity?” The “Requisition Status and Maintenance”
              page will re-display and reflect the new values in the “Shipment Details” box
              and updated status in the “Action/Shipment History” section.
              4.5.1.2.2.4.2. Using the “Backorder List” Page. The AAM can access SSSC,
              click the “Orders” button and select “Backorder” from the drop-down menu;
              on the “Backorders” page, fill in either the “Document Number” or the
              “NSN/NIIN” and “SDC” fields and click the “Find” button; on the
              “Backorder List” page, select the radio button for the record with the
              backorder to be cancelled, scroll down to the area with text that begins “If you
              wish to cancel a backorder...,” ensure that the value in the “Quantity” field is
              equal to the quantity that needs to be cancelled, select the appropriate
              cancellation status code from the “Backorder Cancellation Reason” drop-
              down menu, type in a narrative reason for cancellation action in the
              “Backorder Cancellation Text” box (mandatory only if the cancellation reason
              is status code BQ or CA) and click the “Cancel B/O” button. Click “Ok” in
              the resulting pop-up box with text “Warning: Do you want to cancel this
              Backorder?” If the total backordered quantity was cancelled, SSSC will
              display an Information Message with text, “Backorder cancelled
              successfully.” If a partial quantity was cancelled, SSSC will re-display the
              “Backorder List” page reflecting the backorder with the quantity reduced and
              the suffix code advanced.
       4.5.1.2.3. Reject CSO. Some CSOs are automatically rejected. Examples of when
       SSSC would automatically reject these orders include: the RO for the item in this
       aggregation account is either zero or less than the order quantity; or the order contains
       a “fill-or-kill” advice code and the full order quantity cannot be released for shipment.
       4.5.1.2.4. Refer CSO to SOS. If the “Do Not Refer” box is unchecked for the
       ordered item as it applies to the specified aggregation account, some CSOs are
       automatically referred to the DoD SOS) as referral orders with DIC A4_ (see Table
       4.22 for a transaction record layout). Examples of when SSSC would automatically
       refer these orders to the DoD SOS include: the order contains advice code 2E; or the
       ordered quantity is within the RO but there are insufficient assets on-hand and due-in
       to support the requirement.

77-80          Miscellaneous                 From original CSO
          4.5.1.2.5. Release CSO for Shipment. If no other edits apply which would cause
          CSOs to be suspended on controlled exceptions, backordered, referred to a DoD SOS
          or rejected, and there are sufficient assets on-hand to meet the requirement, SSSC will
          automatically release assets for shipment against these orders.
              4.5.1.2.5.1. Internal Database Updates. This automated release causes an update
              to both internal on-hand balance information visible on the “Depot Asset
              Balances” page and to order status visible on the “Requisition Status and
              Maintenance” page.
              4.5.1.2.5.2. Outbound Transactions. SSSC automatically generates two outbound
              transactions and can be prompted to generate two additional transactions as part
              of the release order process.
                 4.5.1.2.5.2.1. Automatic Issue. SSSC generates an outbound issue transaction
                 with DIC D7Z to D035J which records a transfer out of the appropriate
                 General Ledger Account (see Table 4.23 for a transaction record layout).

                 4.5.1.2.5.2.3. Manual Follow-up. The AAM can prompt SSSC to follow-up
                 for status from the shipper via the following steps: access SSSC, click the
                 “Orders” button, and select “Requisition” from the drop-down menu. On the
                 “Requisition” page, fill in the “Document Number” field and click the “Find”
                 button. On the “Requisition Status and Maintenance” page, click the
                 “Followup” button. Because this is not a “referred” order, SSSC will send a
                 supply status transaction with DIC AE1 to the customer. SSSC also sends a
                 follow-up transaction with DIC AF6 to the shipper (see Table 4.25 for a
                 transaction record layout) for each suffix for which status code BA
                 (unconfirmed) has been posted; however, there is currently a flaw in the
                 system which is causing this outbound transaction to be suppressed.
                   4.5.1.2.5.2.3.1. The AAM can manually post current status by calling the
                   shipper and using the “Cancel/Manual Warehouse” page to either deny or
                   confirm the shipment referenced by the MRO. This can be accomplished
                   via the following steps: access SSSC, click the “Orders” button, and select
                   “Requisition” from the drop-down menu. On the “Requisition” page, fill in
                   the “Document Number” field and click the “Find” button. On the
                   “Requisition Status and Maintenance” page, click the “Cancel/Manual
                   Warehouse Status” hyperlink in the “Additional Notes” area for the desired
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                                    97


                   document number suffix.
                   4.5.1.2.5.2.3.2. To post a denial, on the “Cancel/Manual Warehouse Status”
                   page, in the area just above the “Cancel” button, ensure that the value in the
                   Quantity field is equal to the quantity that needs to be denied, select the
                   appropriate denial reason code from the “Denial Reason” drop-down menu
                   and click the “Deny” button. Click “Ok” in the resulting pop-up box with
                   text “Warning: Do you want to deny this quantity?” The “Requisition
                   Status and Maintenance” page will re-display and reflect the new values in
                   the “Shipment Details” box and updated status in the “Action/Shipment
                   History” section.
                   4.5.1.2.5.2.3.3. To post a confirmation, on the “Cancel/Manual Warehouse
                   Status” page, in the area just above the “Cancel” button, ensure the value in
                   the “Quantity” field is equal to the quantity that needs to be confirmed,
                   adjust the values in the “Shipment Date” fields if necessary, enter a TCN
                   and Mode of Shipment and click the “Confirm” button. The “Requisition
                   Status and Maintenance” page will re-display and reflect the new values in
                   the “Shipment Details” box and updated status in the “Action/Shipment
                   History” section.

                 send a cancellation request to the shipper via the following steps: access
                 SSSC, click the “Orders” button, and select “Requisition” from the drop-down
                 menu. On the “Requisition” page, fill in the “Document Number” field and
                 click the “Find” button. At the bottom of the “Requisition Status and
                 Maintenance “page within the “Action/Shipment History” area, click the
                 “Cancel/Manual Warehouse Status” hyperlink in the “Additional Notes” box
                 for the desired document number suffix. Scroll down the “Cancel/Manual
                 Warehouse Status” page and make sure that the “Quantity” field reflects the
                 actual quantity to be cancelled. Use the drop-down menu to select the
                 appropriate “Cancellation Reason.” If the “Cancellation Reason” is either
                 status code BQ or CA, type descriptive text in the “Cancellation Reason Text”
                 box. Click the “Cancel” button then “Ok” as answer to the User Interface
                 Dialogue box question “Warning: Do you want to cancel this quantity?”
                 Because this is an open shipment, SSSC will send a cancellation transaction
                 with DIC AC6 to the shipper (see Table 4.26 for a transaction record layout).

        4.5.1.3. Follow-on CSO Actions. SSSC can receive inbound customer requests for status
        regarding adjustment to values in receipt acknowledgement of assets tied to previously
        submitted CSOs. SSSC will apply internal edits and in most cases suspend these
        transactions for manager review, create manager review notices (see Chapter 5 for
        details in handling SSSC exceptions and notices) or respond automatically with
        appropriate supply status (see Table 4.3 for DIC AE_ transaction record layout) or
        shipment status (See Table 4.4 for DIC AS_ transaction record layout). CSOs are also
        subject to the quarterly execution of the MOV process.
           4.5.1.3.1. Inbound Follow-up for Status. By submitting a transaction with DIC AF_
           or AT_ (see Table 4.5 for an applicable record layout), a customer can request
           current supply/shipment status. If SSSC has no record of the order document
           number, DIC AT_ transaction will be treated the same as an initial DIC A0_
           transaction.
           4.5.1.3.2. Inbound Modification Request. By submitting a transaction with DIC
           AM_ (see Table 4.6 for an applicable record layout), a customer can request
           modification of the following nine data elements: M&S code, SUPADD, signal code,
           fund code, distribution code, project code, priority code, RDD and advice code.
           4.5.1.3.3. Inbound Request for Improved ESD. By submitting a transaction with
           DIC                                      AFC                                     (see
           Table 4.5 for an applicable record layout), a customer can request an improved ESD.
           4.5.1.3.4. Inbound Cancellation Request. By submitting a transaction with DIC AC_
           or AK_ (see Table 4.7 for a similar record layout), a customer can request
           cancellation of the total or a partial quantity for that order.
           4.5.1.3.5. Inbound Receipt Acknowledgement. By submitting a transaction with DIC
           DRA (see Table 4.11 for an applicable record layout), a customer is acknowledging
           receipt of assets requested via previously generated CSOs. Due to scheduling and
           funding constraints, SSSC was not programmed to automatically process inbound
           receipt acknowledgement transactions; instead, DIC DRA transactions will be
           recorded on an error log that is only accessible to AF users via a Discoverer query
           and only retained for two weeks after transaction processing. Upon request by an
           AAM, SSSC Site Functional OPRs can run a query titled “DR_ Transactions in the
           Error Log” that will allow them to see these transactions. AAMs use this information
           or any other proof of customer receipt to request SSSC Site Functional OPRs contact
           CSC Help Desk for manual closure of applicable CSOs.
           4.5.1.3.6. MOV Process for CSOs. At the beginning of each quarter (January, April,
           July and October), DoD SOSs are expected to generate validation transactions with
           DIC AN_ for backordered requisitions that meet the priority/age criteria described in
           DLM 4000.25-1, Chapter 7, Paragraph C7.1.3 (see Table 5.8 for a record layout of
           what would be an MOV request transaction with DIC AN_ outbound from SSSC).
           The SOS expects the activity to which it sent the validation request to return a
102                                                        AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014


         validation response transaction with the quantity that is still required (see Table 5.8
         for a record layout of what would be an MOV request transaction with DIC AP_
         inbound to SSSC). CSOs are subject to this validation. Due to fiscal and schedule
         constraints, SSSC was not designed to automatically generate MOV requests or react
         to MOV responses. The next two paragraphs are intended to provide a manual-yet-
         auditable process for accomplishing MOV processing against CSOs submitted against
         aggregation accounts:
            4.5.1.3.6.1. Generate Outbound DIC AN_ Request. SSSC Site Functional OPRs
            have been given access to a query titled “Backorders Eligible for MOV
            Processing” that will allow them to see backordered aggregation account CSOs of
            priority and age requiring MOV processing. For active aggregation accounts at
            the ICP, the SSSC Site Functional OPR must run this query periodically during
            the first four weeks of the quarter and include the results in an E-mail to CSC
            requesting generation of properly-formatted DIC AN_ transaction to the affected
            customer. This E-mail will have the applicable AAM as an addressee.
            4.5.1.3.6.2. React to Inbound DIC AP_ Response. SSSC will record inbound
            DIC AP_ response transactions on an error log that is only accessible to AF users
            via a Discoverer query titled “AP_ Transactions in the Error Log” and only
            retained for two weeks after transaction processing. For active aggregation
            accounts at the ICP, the SSSC Site Functional OPR must run this query every two
            weeks and provide the results to the applicable AAM. If the quantity reflected in
            DIC AP_ transaction is zero, the AAM will submit cancellation action of the full
            backordered quantity as described in paragraph 4.5.1.2.2.4. If the quantity
            reflected in DIC AP_ transaction is greater than zero, the AAM will subtract the
            DIC AP_ transaction quantity from the backorder quantity and submit
            cancellation action for the difference using procedures as described in paragraph
            4.5.1.2.2.4 (e.g., backordered quantity of 10 minus DIC AP_ transaction quantity
            of 3 = cancellation quantity of 7).
  4.5.2. Nonstandard Processes to Remove Assets from Aggregation Accounts. If special
  order processing applies or assets remain after all authorized CSOs have been closed, there
  exist nonstandard procedures for removing assets from an aggregation account.
      4.5.2.1. FFC Re-Shipment Processing. If proper authority has been granted to re-ship
      FFC out of ownership code 8 of the MUCO aggregation account (see paragraph
      5.1.4.1.2.7), the AAM accesses SSSC and takes the following steps:
         4.5.2.1.1. If the distribution code was not changed at time of asset receipt, follow the
         procedures in paragraph 4.4.1.3.2 to modify the applicable FFC due-out detail
         record.
         4.5.2.1.2. Once the distribution code has been corrected, click the “Assets” button
         and select “FMS Balances” from the drop-down menu. On the “FMS Balances”
         page, input the MUCO account DoDAAC (i.e., FN2029, FN2039 or FN2060), fill in
         the “NSN/NIIN” under which the FFC was originally receipted and click the “Find”
         button. The “FMS Balances” page will be re-displayed to reflect one or more rows of
         due-out detail information. Select the radio button next to the record with the
         “Document Number/Suffix” to be actioned and click the “Release for Shipment”
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                                   103


        button. If other due-out details exist for the “DoDAAC”/“NSN/NIIN” combination
        actioned, the “FMS Balances” page will re-display with updated due-out detail
        information. If no other due-out details exist for the “DoDAAC”/“NSN/NIIN”
        combination actioned, SSSC displays an “Information Message” page with text,
        "Processing successful. However, when retrieving the list, no data was found for the
        given selection criteria." This release action also causes update to order status visible
        for the FMS document number on the “Requisition Status and Maintenance” page.
     4.5.2.2. FFC Excess Processing. In some instances proper authority will never be
     granted to re-ship FFC to the original foreign customer. However, if the sanction against
     the foreign government has not been lifted, but approval has been granted by the US State
     Department to make alternate disposition of the assets in ownership code 8 of the MUCO
     aggregation account, the MUCO Account Manager must take both online and offline
     action to make this happen.
        4.5.2.2.1. O/P Code Change in Storage Records. Because its records are maintained
        at service customer rather than O/P code level (i.e., AF RIC rather than ownership
        code 8), there is no need to adjust DSS information; however, D035K does maintain
        records at O/P code level. The AAM must work with the local DLA Distribution
        Site, DLA CSS, and D035K OPR to reverse the original receipt into ownership code
        8 and also post a new receipt for the same quantity into ownership code “A” of the
        MUCO account.
        4.5.2.2.2. O/P Code Change in SSSC Records. MUCO account O/P code
        adjustments made to D035K records automatically pass in an interface to update
        SSSC records. However, if this does not occur, the AAM can make manual
        adjustments following the procedures to reverse a MUCO account ownership code 8
        receipt (see paragraph 5.4.2.3) and to post a MUCO account ownership code “A”
        receipt (see paragraph 4.7.1.2.1).
        4.5.2.2.3. Removal from MUCO Aggregation Account. After records have been
        changed to show materiel is in ownership code “A” within the MUCO account, the
        AAM can take one or more of the following actions to remove the assets from the
        aggregation account: initiate standard shipment action against CSOs (see paragraph
        4.5.1.2.2.2); employ MRP procedures (see paragraph 4.5.2.4); issue assets to local
        depot retail (see paragraph 4.5.2.5); or initiate disposal action (see paragraph
        4.5.2.6).
     4.5.2.3. Initiate Purpose Code “H” AF Production Contractor CSOs. Prior to
     implementation of MCA processing, AF permitted loan of government-owned-and-
     managed items to production contractors from aggregated stocks when there was a clear
     benefit to the government in doing so. Although AF MCA “EY” Production Contractor
     loan-for-use processing is employed today to accomplish the same task, there still exists
     (in SSSC) the option to ship assets aggregated in a MUCO aggregation account using
     logic tied to ownership code “H.” Usefulness of this functionality is extremely limited
     because it would result in “free issue” of government property with no expected return.
        4.5.2.3.1. AF Production Contractors authorized to order assets aggregated in
        ownership code “H” of a MUCO aggregation account submit requisitions using the
        format in Table 4.20; ensure to include ownership code “H” in rp 70 of the order.

         The applicable AAM also input the CSO directly into SSSC as follows: access SSSC,
         click the “Orders” button and select “Requisition” from the drop-down menu; on the
         “Requisition” page, fill in the “Document Number” (as provided by the customer)
         and “NSN/NIIN” (authorized item actual NSN/NIIN) and click the “New” button; on
         the “Inbound Requisition” page, make the appropriate inputs IAW Table 4.21
         (including ownership code “H”) and click the “Submit” button.
         4.5.2.3.2. AF “EY” Production Contractor CSOs with ownership code “H” will
         automatically go on backorder with status code B4 rather than prompting automatic
         release for shipment. Although SSSC recognizes H as a valid ownership code,
         D035K does not; so, assets must currently be recorded in ownership code “A” (see
         paragraph 4.7.3.6.1 for procedures to move assets out of ownership code “H”) and
         the order ownership code must be changed to “A” (see paragraph 4.5.1.2.2.1) prior
         to release for shipment (see paragraph 4.5.1.2.2.2).
         4.5.2.3.3. AF base and other service/agency CSOs containing ownership code “H”
         which are submitted against a MUCO aggregation account will be suspended on a
         type “1S” controlled exception requiring manager review (see Chapter 5). Although
         SSSC recognizes “H” as a valid ownership code, D035K does not; therefore, assets
         must currently be recorded in ownership code “A” (see paragraph 4.7.3.6.1 for
         procedures to move assets out of ownership code “H”) and the order purpose code
         must be changed to “A” (see paragraph 4.5.1.2.2.1) prior to release for shipment
         (see paragraph 4.5.1.2.2.2).
      4.5.2.4. Initiate Materiel Returns. Due to fiscal and schedule constraints, SSSC was not
      designed to provide fully automated MRP functionality. However, the following is
      intended to give guidance in combining manual and automated processes to report
      materiel as excess to the DoD SOS and to react to the resulting response from the DoD
      SOS.
         4.5.2.4.1. Report Excess. MRP begins with the asset owner reporting the materiel as
         excess to the DoD SOS via a transaction having DIC FTE. There is no functionality
         in SSSC for generation of such a transaction via the user interface. Instead, using the
         format in Table 4.30, the AAM must go through the SSSC Site Functional OPR to
         request CSC Help Desk have a properly formatted FTE transaction sent to the
         applicable DoD SOS for the pertinent item.

          4.5.2.4.2. Check for Status. The DoD SOS will respond with a reply to the report of
          excess via a transaction with DIC FTR in rp 1-3 and disposition status in rp 65-66
          (see DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.16, “Customer Asset Reporting Transaction Status
          Codes”). It is probable that such a transaction will not reach SSSC or cannot be
          mechanically processed if it does; therefore, the AAM will need to employ alternate
          resources for visibility of DIC FTR response transaction. WEBVLIPS is a useful tool
          for this kind of research. For guidance in obtaining access to WEBVLIPS, follow the
          instructions                                provided                             at
          https://www2.transactionservices.dla.mil/webvlips/docnum.asp.
              4.5.2.4.2.1. Non-returnable Excess. If status provided by the DoD SOS in DIC
              FTR transaction response to a report of excess indicates assets will not be
              returned (e.g., status code TC, TD, etc.), the AAM will take alternate action to
              remove the materiel from the account (e.g., disposal IAW paragraph 4.5.2.6).
              4.5.2.4.2.2. Returnable Excess.        If DIC FTR transaction contains status
              instructing assets are returned to the DoD SOS (e.g., status code TA, TB, etc.), the
              AAM will ensure assets are in ownership code “A” rather than either ownership
              code “H” or “8” and then take action as follows: access SSSC, click the “Orders”
              button and select “Requisition” from the drop-down menu; on the “Requisition”
 106                                                     AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014


              page, fill in the “Document Number” (beginning with the “FN” or “FW”
              DoDAAC assigned to the aggregation account) obtained from the Document
              Number Register and “NSN/NIIN” (authorized item actual NSN/NIIN) and click
              the “New” button; on the “Inbound Requisition” page, make the appropriate
              inputs IAW Table 4.31 and click the “Submit” button. This action results in
              generation of a request for shipment in the form of a MRO transaction with DIC
              A5A.

           4.5.2.4.3. Check for Receipt. SSSC will receive shipment confirmation/denial
           information from DSS. If this was a creditable return (DIC FTR contained status
           code TA), the DoD SOS will send the asset owner a MRP-related receipt
           acknowledgement transaction with DIC FTZ. As noted in paragraph 4.5.2.4.2, it is
           probable that such a transaction either will not reach SSSC or cannot be mechanically
           processed if it does; therefore, the AAM will need to employ alternate resources such

           as WEBVLIPS to view this information. It is possible that the AAM will need to
           work with members of the financial and accounting community at their ICP to ensure
           funds for creditable returns are receipted properly.
        4.5.2.5. Issue to Local Depot Retail. If the DoD SOS for an item does not wish return of
        assets for which aggregation is no longer required, the AAM may seek agreement to
        provide the materiel to DLA CSS. If such an agreement is reached, the assets must be in
        ownership code “A” rather than either ownership code “H” or ownership code 8 and
        either the DLA CSS will send a CSO to the applicable aggregation account RIC or the
        AAM will take action as follows: access SSSC, click the “Orders” button and select
        “Requisition” from the drop-down menu; on the “Requisition” page, fill in the “FN” or
        “FW” document number obtained from the Document Number Register and “NSN/NIIN”
        (authorized item actual NSN/NIIN) and click the “New” button; on the “Inbound
        Requisition” page, make the appropriate inputs IAW Table 4.32 and click the “Submit”
        button. This action will generate a request for shipment in the form of a MRO
        transaction with DIC A5A.

        4.5.2.6. Initiate Shipment to Disposal. SSSC is not designed to provide fully automated
        Disposal functionality; however, the following is intended to give guidance in combining
        manual and automated processes to ship assets to Disposal and to update SSSC with
        auditable transactions for reducing on-hand balances of disposed materiel.
           4.5.2.6.1. Generate Disposal Transaction. In normal disposal procedures, the AAM
           releases assets for shipment to disposal in the form of an outbound transaction with
           DIC A5J to the storage site. There is no functionality in SSSC for generation of such
           a transaction via the user interface; instead, using the format in Table 4.33, the AAM
           must go through the SSSC Site Functional OPR to request CSC Help Desk have a
           properly formatted DIC A5J transaction sent to the applicable storage site. The assets
           must be in ownership code “A” rather than either ownership code “H” or ownership
           code 8 to make this possible. It is probable that SSSC will receive from D035K a
           shipment confirmation transaction with DIC ARJ which will be suspended as a type
           “1N” controlled exception. The AAM must place a printed copy of this exception in
           the aggregation account folder then delete the controlled exception. If user access
           does not permit this action, a request to delete action must be taken by the SSSC Site
           Functional OPR.

           4.5.2.6.2. To update SSSC with an auditable transaction for reducing on-hand
           balances of disposed materiel, process an IAV following procedures in paragraph
           4.4.3.2.1
4.6. Inbound and Outbound Transactions. This paragraph provides a quick reference for the
various types of transactions either coming into or going out of SSSC relative to these major
categories of aggregation account processing: CSO; FMS FFC; PR/MIPR/Contract; and PO.
   4.6.1. Inbound. Relative to aggregation account processing, SSSC can receive transactions
   inbound from D035K and DAAS (as a conduit for transactions coming from customers and
   DoD SOSs). Transactions are as follows:
        4.6.1.1. Initial Order from Customer (DIC A0_). CSO requisitions are used to request
        shipment of assets out of an aggregation account (reference paragraph 5.5.1 for details
        and see Table 4.20 for a transaction record layout).
        4.6.1.2. Passing Order from Customer (DIC A3_). CSO passing orders are used to

                                           Chapter 5

                  SSSC NOTICES AND CONTROLLED EXCEPTIONS

5.1. Overview. Standard SSSC edits ensure input transaction validity. Certain erroneous or
incompatible entries are mechanically corrected within the process, whereas others require
manual research and correction. When transactions cannot be mechanically corrected and are
not subject to automatic rejection, they are suspended as controlled exceptions. Other
transactions become (or trigger) notices and may require a new transaction input.
5.2. Notices.
   5.2.1. Notices can be accessed online in SSSC via the “Notices” page (click the “Notice”
   hyperlink at the top of any modernized SCS page). The resulting “Notice List” page will
   display a list of up to 50 notices. The account manager can see other pages of the list by
   clicking on the hyperlinked page number next to the “Go to page” label on the right-hand
   side of either the top or bottom of the page. The page identifies the total number of notices
   available and which block of data is being displayed to the left of the “Select All” button
   (e.g., Records 51-100 of 188).
   5.2.2. All notices that are not manually deleted will be stored for 180 days before being
   deleted via a daily batch job. Only the applicable SSSC account manager (whom the notice
   was sent based on user role/level of access) can view/remove notices.
   5.2.3. The consequences for not working notices in a timely manner include: failure to
   process some valid transactions; processing of valid transactions against erroneous database
   values with undesired results; failure to deal with DIC AX1 transactions unmatched to open
   orders, possibly resulting in status code DR reject of valid requisitions or tacit approval of
   invalid requisitions; and unnecessary growth of various databases which could affect system
   response time.
   5.2.4. There are four review options SSSC account managers take in regards to notices:
       5.2.4.1. Sort: By clicking on the triangle pointing either up or down next to the
       corresponding header field on the “Notice List” page, the account manager can sort their
       notices in either ascending or descending order by Subject or Date.
       5.2.4.2. Filter: The account manager can see which filters are in use by viewing the
       information labeled as “Filter Criteria” on the “Notice List” page. To remove existing
       filters, click the “Clear Filter” button. To apply new filters, click the “Change Filter”
       button. Filter results are limited to those notices viewable/actionable by the account
       manager. Three types of filters can be applied:
          5.2.4.2.1. “Date” Filter. To see a list of notices generated on specific dates, the
          account manager stipulates both a begin date and end date and clicks the “Apply

          (selectable from a drop-down list) and Year (four positions). The begin date must be
          less than or equal to the end date.
          5.2.4.2.2. Subject Filter. For a list of all their notices, the account manager can select
          the “All Subjects” button. To see a list of their notices with a specific subject, the
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                                    117


        account manager can select the “Limit to Subject” button and click in each box next
        to a desired notice subject. To see a list of their notices with a specific word/phrase in
        the body of the notice, the account manager can select the “All Subjects” button and
        type the desired word/phrase (up to 26 characters) in the block labeled “Message
        Body Contains:.” Account managers may use an asterisk as a wildcard in any
        position of the text box. The wildcard must be used with at least one other character
        for example, “*A,” “A*,” “*A*B,” etc.
        5.2.4.2.3. Viewed Status Filter. For a list of all their viewed and unviewed notices,
        the account manager can select the “All Notices” button. For a list of notices not yet
        viewed, the account manager can select the “Not Viewed Notices” button and for a
        list of notices already viewed, but not deleted, the account manager can select the
        “Viewed Notices” button. It is not possible to see a list of deleted notices.
     5.2.4.3. View: To view notices, the account manager either clicks a single hyperlinked
     subject or clicks in the boxes in the rows of the desired notices on the “Notice List” page
     and clicks the “View Selected” button. The account manager can select one, multiple or
     all notices using this method. The account manager can also select all notices by clicking
     the “Select All” then “View Selected” buttons. Another option to deselect all is to click
     the “Deselect All” or “Reset” buttons. Subject hyperlinks on the “Notice List” page will
     display as bold text until the associated “Notice Detail” page has been viewed. Previously
     viewed notices will display in un-bolded text.
        5.2.4.3.1. The “Notice Detail” page is constructed as follows:
            5.2.4.3.1.1. Subject: Data is the same as found hyperlinked on the “Notice List”
            page. Note: The notice type (i.e., 1A, 93, N12, etc.) does not appear on any of the
            notice pages (i.e., Notice List, Notice Detail, or Notice Filter).
            5.2.4.3.1.2. Date: Includes day, month, year, hour, minute and second the notice
            was created.
            5.2.4.3.1.3. Notice ID: The data is a unique seven-numeric-position code used to
            differentiate that notice from other notices.
            5.2.4.3.1.4. Error message text (unlabeled). This data is found in the title of the
            notice just before the “Reason for Exception” paragraph (e.g., “Contract
            Problems”).
            5.2.4.3.1.5. MDC:     SSSC MDC for the applicable contract or aggregation
            account.
            5.2.4.3.1.6. Wholesale Activity: Location where the applicable SSSC account is
            managed.
            5.2.4.3.1.7. System Identifier: Always “SSSC” for SSSC notices.
            5.2.4.3.1.8. Additional elements (various labels). This data displays various data
            elements in the transaction that triggered the notice (e.g., document identifier,
            quantity, SUPADD, etc.). It also may include some data elements used internal to
            SSSC for routing and categorizing (e.g., “patternId,” “areaManager,”
            “accountableFlag,” etc.).

         5.2.4.3.2. If the account manager has selected more than one notice and depending
         where in the list the displayed notice appears, the system provides the account
         manager three navigation buttons:
             5.2.4.3.2.1. Previous. This option is grayed-out on the first notice in the selected
             list. Clicking the “Previous” button causes the system to display the previous
             notice in the selected list.
             5.2.4.3.2.2. Return To List. This option is usable on any notice in the selected
             list. Clicking this button causes the system to display the “Notice List” page.
             Note: The displayed page will not have any notices selected, but retains whatever
             filter criteria was applied to create the list.
             5.2.4.3.2.3. Next. This option is grayed-out on the last notice in the selected list.
             Clicking the “Next” button causes the system to display the next notice in the
             selected list.
      5.2.4.4. Delete: Once the applicable account manager has taken follow-on action
      required to ensure useful data is not lost (see Table 5.1 for recommended actions), s/he
      will delete pertinent notices. The account manager can use one of the following three
      methods to delete notices:
         5.2.4.4.1. From the “Notice List” Page. Click in the boxes in the rows of the desired
         notices on the “Notice List” page and click the “Delete Selected” button. Then click
         the “Ok” button in the pop-up box with text “You have requested to delete the
         selected notices. Do you wish to proceed?” The system displays the “Notice List”
         page with the remaining notices and an updated record count. The Filter Criteria is
         unchanged.
         5.2.4.4.2. From the “Notice Detail” Page. View a notice on the “Notice Detail” page,
         then click the “Delete” button. The system does not prompt with a pop-up box;
         rather, it displays the “Notice List” page with the remaining notices and updated
         record count. The Filter Criteria is unchanged.
         5.2.4.4.3. From the “Notice Filter” Page. Set a date range or subject filter using the
         “Notice Filter” page, click the “Delete Notices” button then click the “Ok” button in
         the pop-up box with text “You have requested to delete all notices that match the
         entered date range and/or a subject filter criteria. Do you wish to continue?” The
         system displays the “Notice List” page with the remaining notices and updated record
         count. The Filter Criteria is unchanged.
  5.2.5. See Table 5.1 for detail guidance on processing notices within SSSC.

5.3. Controlled Exceptions.
   5.3.1. All controlled exceptions can be accessed online in SSSC via the “Exceptions” page
   (click the “Exceptions” button at the top of any SCS page). Depending on their various
   levels of access, users have an option to view controlled exceptions by MDC, SDC,
   Exception Type, NSN/NIIN, document number, DoDAAC or combinations thereof.
   5.3.2. The user may request all controlled exceptions for given selection criteria by entering
   the criteria (e.g., three-digit MDC or two-digit SDC) in the appropriate fields and clicking the
   “Find” button. The system will display, by document number (descending), then by “SFX”
   (descending), then by date received (ascending) and finally by exception code (ascending),
   the following data for each controlled exception as defined in Table 5.2

   5.3.3. From this page, the user selects the exception to be displayed for action and clicks the
   “Transaction Type” hyperlink (e.g., “Requisition”). The next page to appear will display the
   specific suspended transaction. Depending on the type of controlled exception, the user can
   clear the exception in one of four ways:
       5.3.3.1. Click the “Release” button to have SSSC continue processing the transaction
       with no changes. This option is most often used after the account manager has updated
       other internal system database elements that enable the suspended transaction to pass
       system edits once the transaction is resubmitted.
       5.3.3.2. Change one or more fields of data in the transaction and click the “Correct”
       button to allow continued SSSC system processing with changes in place. If the user
       wishes to return the data to what it was prior to any changes made and before clicking the
       “Correct” button, click the “Reset” button. Note: Users must take care in changing data
       within the suspended transaction as input of improper data or updates to various fields
       can trigger additional system edits that unintentionally transfer the transaction from one
       type controlled exception to another.
       5.3.3.3. Select one of the manager action codes from the “Choose Manager Action”
       drop-down box and click the “Manager Action” button to have SSSC process the
       transaction in a specific manner (e.g., reject with a valid reject status code). Note: Use of
       Manager Action code “BQ” or “CA” requires the user to provide a narrative explanation
       in the “Cancellation Reason Text” box. If the user wishes to return the data to what it
       was prior to selection of the manager action or input of narrative text and before clicking
       the “Manager Action” button, s/he may click the “Reset” button. Note: Users must take
       care in changing data within the suspended transaction as input of improper data or
       updates to various fields can trigger additional system edits that might unintentionally
       transfer the transaction from one type controlled exception to another.
       5.3.3.4. Click the “Delete” button to have SSSC halt processing the transaction
       altogether. Note: This option is exclusively available to SSSC Site and HQ AFMC
AFMCMAN 23-5V5 9 JUNE 2014                                                                 135


     OPRs for transactions on some type controlled exceptions. No user has the ability to
     delete controlled exceptions with “Transaction Type” of requisition.
  5.3.4. The user must work all controlled exceptions in a timely manner to assure currency of
  data and to give proper attention to customer orders. See Table 5.3 for detailed guidance in
  processing controlled exceptions within SSSC. Established acceptable timeframes for
  working controlled exceptions are based upon the priority of the transaction that has been
  suspended for review:
     5.3.4.1. Priorities 01-08 must be worked within four days from the date the exception
     was created; otherwise, SSSC will generate an “Overage Exception Notice” on the fifth
     day, a “Delinquent Exception Notice” on the 10th day and a “Critical Exception Notice”
     on the 15th day (and every 45 days until the exception is worked).
     5.3.4.2. Priorities 09-15 must be worked within 14 days from the date the exception was
     created; otherwise, SSSC will generate an “Overage Exception Notice” on the 15th day, a
     “Delinquent Exception Notice” on the 20th day and a “Critical Exception Notice” on the
     30th day (and every 45 days until the exception is worked).
  5.3.5. Consequences for not working controlled exceptions in a timely manner include:
     5.3.5.1. Customer orders go unfilled (which could result in Requests for Equitable
     Adjustment).
     5.3.5.2. Supply and/or shipment status goes un-posted. This could leave the SSSC user
     with invalid views of order status, prevent SSSC from sending H075C cancellation or
     reject status, be used to deobligate funds, prevent SSSC from sending G009, G072D and
     H075C shipment status be used in the billing process, and perpetuate an out-of-balance
     condition for that order (i.e., shipped + cancelled + open is not equal to total ordered).
     5.3.5.3. Huge numbers of exceptions generate, “growing” various databases which could
     affect system response time.

                              CODES AND DATA ELEMENTS

6.1. Overview. This chapter centralizes references for codes and data elements appearing in
SSSC. Paragraph 6.2 provides references tied to specific codes/data elements and lists acronyms
generally recognized within SSSC. Each code/data element definition includes a cross reference
to the SSSC pages on which it appears. See Chapter 2 for a more detailed cross reference
between data displayed on SSSC pages and corresponding data element/database tables
accessible through the Discoverer ad hoc query tool. Also see Chapter 7 for a more detailed
description of data displayed on SSSC reports accessible through normal user interface.
6.2. Code/Data Element Definitions and Values or References. Definitions and data values
are provided in this chapter for those codes/data elements unique to SSSC. Definitions and
references for further information are provided for those codes/data elements that are not unique
to SSSC. Many codes and data elements reflect multiple names. Some codes/data elements are
grouped together in this chapter because of their commonly recognized association; they include:
Action, Cost/Price, Date, DoDAAC, Item Number, MDC, NSN, Quantity, RIC, Status and
Transaction Type. For these reasons, the codes/data elements are listed alphabetically under the
most commonly used and/or descriptive names. Elements within brackets (e.g., [Selection] and
[As of Date]), although not reflected on the page, are understood and captured in the list below
for clarification.
   6.2.1. Abbreviated Contract Number (ABCN). 8-position alpha/numeric element found in rp
   73-80 of GFM orders generated by AF repair contractors. Each ABCN has a unique
   association with a 13-position contract number or a 17-position contract/order number.
   Authorized values for SSSC are to be configured as noted in Table 6.1. Applicable pages are
   listed in Table 6.2. Additional information regarding use of this data element can be found in
   Chapter 5.

         6.2.3.2. On the “Inbound Requisition and Requisition Status and Maintenance (Order
         Details)” pages, user selection of one of three radio buttons under the “Action” header
         has the following results:
            6.2.3.2.1. Forced Shipment/Ship From. Within SSSC, there are non-standard
            methods to remove assets from aggregation accounts such as effecting return of
            materiel to the DoD SOS (regardless of whether or not credit is to be granted). The
            “Ship From” field can be updated to reflect the storage DoDAAC from which
            materiel is to be shipped. See Chapter 5 for additional information.
            6.2.3.2.2. Loan Order. AF repair and production contractors authorized to borrow
            AF-managed items are required to submit their orders through SSSC for MCA
            validation. Selection of “Loan Order” on the “Inbound Requisition” page resets
            certain data element values as follows: “Bill To” becomes “Free Issue;”

           “Management Code” becomes “L;” “Purpose Code” becomes “K – Reserved for
           Loan;” and “Signal Code” becomes “D – Ship to DoDAAC, Bill to Free Issue.”
           6.2.3.2.3. No Special Action. This is the default selection when neither forced
           shipment/ship from nor loan order applies.
   6.2.4. Action Code. 3-position alpha/numeric code which identifies the file maintenance
   action being attempted against a contract master file. This code only appears on the “Display

   Chapter 5 for additional information regarding this data element.
   6.2.19. Close Record. SSSC expects to receive updated supply and shipment status from
   DoD SOSs to which POs and CSOs have previously been referred (see Chapters 3, 4 and 5).
   Applicable pages are listed in Table 6.13. Selection of a “Close Record” radio button is the
   first step in a SSSC OPR’s action to modify SSSC order detail records to better reflect actual
   status.

       6.2.19.1. Frequent data synchronization between SSSC and D035A provides additional
       opportunity for maintaining valid information in SSSC as regards to orders for AFMC-
       managed items; therefore, manual record closure is not an option for orders against
       AFMC-managed items. For orders placed against non AFMC-managed items, users
       having SSSC Site and HQ OPR access have the ability to manually close certain
       document number/Suffix/Sequence Number records so the most accurate
       supply/shipment status is reflected.
       6.2.19.2. To close a record, the SSSC OPR must click the “Close Record” radio button
       for the document number/suffix/sequence number row to be changed then scroll down to
       the bottom of the page. The “Quantity” field in the record closure area of the page would
       have automatically been adjusted to equal the total quantity that could be closed for the
       selected row. The OPR must next select the appropriate record closure status from the
       “Status” drop-down menu (see Table 6.14. for authorized values), adjust the quantity to
       the actual quantity being closed, adjust the action date if a more appropriate date is
       known and click the “Close Record” button. The quantity for which record closure
       action is taken is no longer taken into account when computing a “Closed Date” for the
       order.

  *
       will acquire all materiel and be reimbursed under a separate contract line item for
       Contractor Acquired Property (CAP). A contract coded with an asterisk is not passed to
       SSSC; therefore, any order for GFM received in SSSC for that contract is rejected.
       Specifies NSN and quantity edits apply. Requires manual input of the NSNs and
  A
       quantities directly into SSSC.
       Specifies GFM was authorized to be requisitioned, but orders will no longer be

                        SSSC ACCESS REQUEST PROCEDURES

A2.1. Process to access SSSC:
   A2.1.1. Requestor Action.
       A2.1.1.1. Per Department of Defense (DoD) 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program,
       subsystem access is limited to those individuals determined trustworthy as a result of the
       favorable completion of a National Agency Check (NAC) or Entrance NAC (ENTNAC)
       or who are under the escort of cleared personnel. Where escorting such persons is not
       feasible, requestors must be cleared to access Automated Data Processing Systems
       (ADPS) at the IT-II/III levels via favorably completed NAC, NAC Inquiries (NACI),
       Periodic Reinvestigation for Secret Clearance (PRS) or NAC with Local Agency Check
       (NACLC) certification. Requestors pending security clearance must complete and
       provide a “Letter of Responsibility” (LOR) along with DD Form 2875, System
       Authorization Access Request (SAAR), as described in paragraph 1.3.1.2.3. LOR must be
       signed by the requestor’s government supervisor.
   A2.1.2. Authorized personnel gain access to SSSC by submitting a DD Form 2875, to
   include locally devised Part V, to the appropriate Designated Approval Authority (DAA).
       A2.1.2.1. Select User Roles. Table 1.1 identifies which user roles are allowed to access
       the various pages, tables and reports that are related to SSSC. Note: Users may have
