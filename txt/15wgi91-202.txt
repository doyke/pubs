1. 15th Wing Safety Program.
     1.1. Unit Commanders are Responsible for Implementing the Air Force Safety
     Program.
        1.1.1. All 15 WG unit commanders (CC) will develop and implement a Commander’s
        Safety Program within 30 days of appointment. Units will coordinate proposed safety
        plans, revisions, wing publications, or Operating Instructions (OI) with 15 WG/SE before
        publication.
        1.1.2. All 15 WG unit CCs will receive a new commander’s safety brief from 15 WG/SE
        after taking command. Unit CCs should coordinate this briefing with the 15 WG Chief of
        Safety or designated representative.
        1.1.3. All 15 WG unit commanders will appoint a primary and alternate Unit Safety
        Representative (USR) in writing, consistent with their Total Force Integration manning
        document. The USRs must begin training within 30 days after appointment. Individuals
        appointed must have a minimum of twelve months retainability before a permanent
        change of station (PCS).
        1.1.4. All 15 WG unit CCs must review the status of their unit safety program monthly
        with the USR and sign the commanders review/signature log located in TAB J (see
        paragraph 4.2.8.8) of the unit ground safety management book.
        1.1.5. Flying unit CCs will appoint a Squadron Assigned Flight Safety Officer (SAFSO)
        and an Additional Duty Flight Safety Officer (ADFSO). Aviation Safety Program
        Management (ASPM) or Aircraft Mishap Investigation Course (AMIC) formal training
        for SAFSOs at Air Force Safety Center (AFSC) is desired and will be coordinated
        through 15 WG/SE. Within 30 days of appointment, SAFSOs and ADFSOs will be
        trained on local procedures by 15 WG/SEF (Flight Safety).
     1.2. Protecting FOUO and Limited-Use Information. Any release of safety mishap
     reports or information pertaining to safety investigations, outside Air Force safety channels,
     must be coordinated with 15 WG Chief of Safety or designated representative prior to
     release. Refer to Air Force Instruction (AFI) 91-204, Safety Investigation and Reports for
     further information, possible exceptions and handling restrictions. Safety mishap reports
     have information in them that must be protected under FOUO, Privacy Act or Export Control
     Act. For FOUO handling procedures, see AFI 91-204 and Department of Defense (DoD)
     5200.1R, Information Security Program.
2. Safety Inspections.
     2.1. Annual Inspections.
        2.1.1. 15 WG/SE will publish an annual inspection schedule before 1 October of the next
        fiscal year (FY). The schedule will outline the month the individual units will be
        inspected. Specific dates will be coordinated with unit CCs at least 30 days before
        planned inspection. 15 WG/SE will combine inspections of disciplines (Weapons Safety
        [SEW], Ground Safety [SEG], Flight Safety [SEF]) as much as possible to minimize time
        impact on units.
15WGI91-202 23 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                      3


       2.1.2. 15 WG/SEG, 15 WG/SEF, and 15 WG/SEW will out-brief unit CCs or their
       designated representative following program assessment if requested. A written report
       will be provided to the unit CC within 30 days of program assessment completion.
   2.2. High Interest Items.
       2.2.1. High interest items will be identified by each safety discipline based on trends or
       problem areas noted during annual and spot inspections. Semiannually, a memorandum
       identifying the 15 WG/SE high-interest items will be signed by the Chief of Safety and
       forwarded to all units. These high-interest areas will typically be published after the
       second and fourth quarters. After six months, the current high-interest items will be
       reviewed to determine if items should remain high interest. High interest items may be
       reviewed for closure at earlier intervals if conditions dictate.
3. Flight Safety.
   3.1. Aircraft Mishap Investigation.
       3.1.1. Damage to any 15 WG aircraft, from any source, shall be immediately reported to
       15 WG/SE through the 15 WG Command Post (15 WG/CP, 448-6900). Following a 15
       WG aircraft mishap or incident, the aircraft CC should complete Air Mobility Command
       (AMC) Form 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet. If
       mishap involves 154 WG aircraft, the aircraft CC will complete the Hawaii Air National
       Guard (HIANG) Form 36. AMC Form 97 must be sent to 15 WG/SEF (FAX 449-0798)
