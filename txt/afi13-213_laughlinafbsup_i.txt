                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope and Purpose.
   1.1.1. This AFI provides guidance for developing an Airfield Driving Program (ADP) to
   provide safe ground vehicle operations and pedestrian control on USAF owned and/or
   operated airfields. It outlines training requirements for all personnel (e.g. military, DoD
   Civilians, Contractors, etc.) who, as a part of their job, are required to drive unescorted on an
   airfield.
   1.1.2. Personnel required to drive on the airfield must be knowledgeable of and comply with
   the procedures outlined in this AFI and locally developed Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI).
   For the purpose of this AFI, the ADI is a wing or base level instruction.
   1.1.3. In today’s complex airfield environment, there are incidents involving aircraft,
   pedestrians, and ground vehicles at USAF airfields that lead to property damage and
   personnel injury. One of the most hazardous incidents for an airfield driver to be involved
   with is a runway incursion. A runway incursion occurs when an aircraft, vehicle or person
   enters the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-off of aircraft
   without approval from Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT). Runway incursions have the
   potential to result in aircraft endangerment and loss of life. While there are several factors
   involved in a runway incursion, the leading causes of these incidents result from a failure to
   follow procedures, inadequate vehicle operator training, and loss of situational awareness.
   Therefore, strict adherence to the procedures in this AFI is essential to preventing aircraft-
   vehicle mishaps and personnel injury on the airfield.
   1.1.4. Shared-Use Airfields. Airfield Management (AM) personnel at shared-use airfields
   (e.g. Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve units) must work with the civil airport manager
   to develop and implement local airfield driving procedures where applicable.
   1.1.5. Contingency Locations. At contingency locations, the Senior Airfield Authority
   (SAA) or equivalent, may authorize deviations to airfield driving procedures outlined in this
   AFI to support tactical or combat operations/situations. Authority must not be delegated.
      1.1.5.1. In the interest of safety to airfield and flight operations, deviations to this AFI
      should be by exception only and include a Risk Management assessment. Factors to
      consider for deviations include but are not limited to the length of time the operation has
      been in place and available resources.
      1.1.5.2. If time permits, or at the discretion of the SAA or equivalent, forward proposed
      deviations to the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, for an operational review.
      1.1.5.3. Provide the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, an informational copy of
      approved deviations to assist with establishing compliance priorities, providing oversight,
      and developing area of responsibility execution activities.
1.2. Waivers, Recommended Changes and Issuing New Airfield Driving Policy or
Procedures.
   1.2.1. Waivers.

       1.2.1.1. Waiver Authority. HQ AFFSA/A3A will provide waivers to this instruction
       only upon an official MAJCOM OPR for AO request when a requirement makes a waiver
       necessary or compliance with creates a hazard. HQ AFFSA/A3A grants waivers to this
       AFI for a period not to exceed two years.
       1.2.1.2. Waiver Process. AF IMT 4058, Airfield Operations Policy Waiver will be used
       to request waivers to this instruction. If additional space is required, annotate on plain
       bond paper and submit along with the form. Number each comment with the
       corresponding block number. In addition, units will submit an Operational Risk
       Management (ORM) Assessment in accordance with AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk
       Management (ORM) Guidelines and Tools or alternate risk mitigation procedures with all
       waiver requests.
           1.2.1.2.1. All waiver requests to this instruction must be reviewed/coordinated on by
           the Wing Airfield Driving Program Manager (Wing ADPM), Airfield Operations
           Flight Commander (AOF/CC) and Wing Safety.
           1.2.1.2.2. The AOF/CC forwards the AF IMT 4058 through the Senior Operational
           Commander (e.g., OG/CC) to the MAJCOM OPR for AO, who will then
           review/coordinate and send to HQ AFFSA.
           1.2.1.2.3. Submit additional data (e.g., Letters of Procedure (LOP), airfield diagrams,
           etc.) to substantiate the waiver request as required.
       1.2.1.3. Submit waiver renewal requests to HQ AFFSA No Later Than (NLT) 30 days
       prior to expiration.
    1.2.2. Recommended Changes. Use the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of
    Publication to submit recommended changes to this AFI. Recommended changes must be
    coordinated on by the Wing ADPM, AOF/CC and host Wing/CC or equivalent then
    forwarded to the MAJCOM OPR for AO.               The MAJCOM OPR for AO will
    review/coordinate on proposed changes prior to forwarding to HQ AFFSA/A3A for final
    disposition.
    1.2.3. Issuing New Airfield Driving Policy or Procedures. In accordance with AFI 33-360,
    Publications Management Program, a Guidance Memorandum (GM) or Interim Change (IC)
    will be used to prescribe procedures and guidance pending revision of this AFI. New USAF
    procedures/guidance will be distributed through the MAJCOM OPR for AO. GMs and ICs
    will be posted on the AFDPO website until formalized in this publication.

   involved in the ADP (e.g. Wing/CC, OG/CC, Unit/CC, AOF/CC, Wing ADPM, unit
   ADPMs, AM, SF, ATCT, Wing Safety, Hospital/Medical Treatment Facility).
       3.2.1.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Responsibilities are outlined in AFI 13-213,
       Chapter 2, and this supplement.
   3.2.2. AF IMT 483 Issuance. Outline wing and/or base level procedures for issuing an AF
   IMT 483 to base assigned personnel, TDY personnel and Non-base assigned contractors
   requiring airfield driving privileges. Include requirements for issuance of an AF IMT 483 to
   individuals requiring Non-CMA, CMA, Runway and restrictions as applicable (e.g. Ramp
   only, Daylight Hours only, etc.)
       3.2.2.1. The AFM, Wing ADPM, and other designated AM representatives are
       responsible for signing AF IMT 483s.
       3.2.2.2. Authority for signing AF IMT 483 must not be delegated outside AM.
       3.2.2.3. All base assigned personnel (e.g. military, DoD civilian, Contractor, etc.)
       required to operate a vehicle on the airfield, must complete all airfield drivers’ training
       and testing requirements outlined in this AFI and the ADI prior to issuance of an AF IMT
       483. Note: An AFSC or career field training (e.g. aircraft maintenance, aircrew, fire and
       emergency services, security forces, transportation, etc.) is not a substitute for completion
       of airfield driving training and testing requirements outlined in this AFI.
       3.2.2.4. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) AF IMT 483s will be issued by Wing ADPM,

     3.2.2.8. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) ―All Airfield Areas‖: Personnel whose duties
     require them to enter the CMA will have their AF IMT 483 annotated with ―All Areas.‖
     This category will be kept to a minimum.
     3.2.2.9. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Units/Squadrons that do not work or drive at night,
     or are not manned continuously can opt for ―Authorized Daylight Hours Only‖ annotated
     on the AF IMT 483. Units/Squadrons with this annotation are exempted from the
     nighttime orientation check ride, and will not drive at night. Should the need to begin
     driving at night occur, coordinate with Wing ADPM for implementation of night time
     check rides and full training. The Wing ADPM will update the AF IMT 483 after night
     time training completed.
     3.2.2.10. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) All required airfield training and testing must be

        approval from the ATCT. Exception: Vehicles and/or pedestrians may be escorted
        into the CMA by another vehicle and/or pedestrian that has two-way radio contact
        with the ATCT.
            3.2.7.2.1.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Laughlin’s controlled movement area
            begins at the VFR hold position markings of Runway 13R/31L and extends 100’
            east and parallel to Runway 13L/31R extending to inside edge of North and South
            perimeter roads. The CMA also encompasses all taxiways, overruns, and service
            roads depicted in attachment 8.
            3.2.7.2.1.2. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) No vehicle or pedestrian will be allowed
            to pass the VFR runway hold position markings unless the driver has been given
            permission from the control tower. VFR hold position markings are marked with
            two solid yellow lines and two broken yellow lines and are located approximately
            100 feet from the edge of the runway (see Attachment 13 for visual depiction of
            the VFR runway hold position markings). VFR runway hold position markings
            are located on Taxiways A, B, C, D, and E on the Runway 13R/31L. In addition,
            VFR hold position markings are located on Taxiways A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and J
            and between Runways 13R/31L and 13C/31C. More VFR hold runway position
            markings are located on Taxiways A, B, C, F, and G, between Runways 13C/31C
            and 13L/31R, and Taxiway Hotel. All VFR runway hold position markings are
            coincidental with the requirements to protect the precision navigational aid area.
            Extreme caution must be exercised in this area as it lies in the approach zone of

        must be surrendered to AM and airfield driving privileges temporarily suspended
        until an investigation and retraining is completed.
            3.2.8.3.2.1. The Unit Commander of the individual who committed a runway
            incursion will be notified that one of their unit personnel was involved in a
            CMAV and the incident is under investigation. This notification will be made
            within 24 hours or the next duty day of the alleged incident, whichever occurs
            first.
            3.2.8.3.2.2. Runway Incursions and CMAV events must be reported to Wing

  RADIO COMMUNICATIONS PHRASEOLOGY, DISCIPLINE AND TECHNIQUES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Radio communications are a critical link in the ATC system. The single, most
   important thought in communications with the ATCT is understanding. It is essential to
   acknowledge each radio communication with controllers by using the appropriate call sign.
   4.1.2. Brevity is important, therefore, radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   However, controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their
   control duties. Conversely, the vehicle operator, must know exactly what the controller
   wants them to do.
   4.1.3. Vehicle operators must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio
   communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating on an
   active runway.
4.2. Radio Techniques.
   4.2.1. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
   transmitter will be ineffective and will probably override/block out the other receiver causing
   the other vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
   4.2.2. Think before keying the transmitter. You must know exactly what you need to say
   before you say it.
   4.2.3. The microphone should be very close to your lips and, after pressing the ―microphone
   button‖, a slight pause may be necessary to be sure, the first word is transmitted clearly.
   Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
   4.2.4. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The
   controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or
   scanning the runway to enable your request.
   4.2.5. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
   recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
   position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
   unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
   ―stuck mike,‖ and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
   problem.
   4.2.6. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the
   ground station equipment. Refer to the airfield diagram to determine possible radio blind
   spots.
   4.2.7. Use caution when using a vehicle mounted/handheld radio and operating a vehicle at
   the same time. When possible, only use the radio when the vehicle is safely parked.
4.3. Phraseology. Vehicle operators must contact the ATCT controller each and every time
they proceed onto or leave the CMA. When proceeding onto a CMA, vehicle operators must
advise the controller of three things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your

intentions are. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications so ground
control and other persons know that the message was received. Vehicle operators must always
give aircraft and ground control transmissions priority unless an emergency exists. VHF/UHF
transmissions are reserved for the primary use of aircraft and ATCT personnel.
   4.3.1. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:

VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “JACKSONVILLE TOWER
                                      AIRFIELD ONE.”
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD ONE, JACKSONVILLE
                                      TOWER.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “JACKSONVILLE TOWER,
                                      AIRFIELD ONE REQUEST TO

                                      OF (runway).”
   4.3.2. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time for
   correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if you
   do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat it. Good
   communications only occur when each party knows and understands what the other is saying.

Table 4.2. Sample Read back Instructions
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                      “AIRFIELD ONE UNDERSTANDS
                                       APPROVED TO CROSS (runway)

equipment) intended to be used either wholly or in part for the arrival, departure, and movement
of aircraft.
AF Runway Safety Action Team—AFRSAT teams are composed of AFFSA and/or MAJCOM
OPR for AO functional experts used to analyze, report and determine corrective actions required
to reduce the number of Controlled Movement Area Violations on the airfield. AFRSAT
functional experts will evaluate all pertinent areas that are a part of, or affect, the negative trend
or unsafe condition.
Aircraft on Final—Commonly used to mean that an aircraft is on final approach course or is
aligned with a landing area.
Airfield—An area prepared for the accommodation (including any buildings, installations, and
equipment) of landing and take-off of aircraft.
Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI)—Formerly known as the flight line driving instruction.
Establishes local operations, procedures and training standards for driving a vehicle on the
airfield. Also called ADI.

Airfield Driving Program Manager (ADPM)—An individual appointment by the unit
commander to administer the organization’s airfield driving program.
Airfield Facilities—Includes: runways, taxiways, parking and servicing areas, ATC facilities,
Airfield Management, navigational aids, aircraft fire suppression and rescue services and airfield
lighting systems.
Airfield Management—A function that conducts airfield inspections and checks for safety and
compliance with planning and design criteria. Plans, organizes and directs airfield activities to
include airfield construction/repairs, airfield driving program, ice/snow removal operations,
Bird/Wildlife control, etc. Procures, maintains, and produces information on safe operation of
aircraft through the national and international airspace system such as Flight Information
Publications, aeronautical charts and maps, Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), local airfield and
navigational aid status, and weather information. Process domestic and international flight plans.
Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS)—A facility located near the airfield that provides
aircrews with flight plan processing and planning services.
Airfield Manager (AFM)—Works directly for the AOF/CC and manages airfield management
facilities to ensure effective support to the base flying mission and transient aircrews.
Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC)—Responsible for the overall
operation/services provided by the airfield operations flight in support of the wing flying mission
and in compliance with USAF and FAA guidelines.
Clear—ATC term used between pilots and air traffic controllers, not authorized for use by
personnel operating motor vehicles on the airfield.
Commercial Vehicle—A vehicle, which is owned or leased by a commercial firm.
Controlled Areas—Controlled areas are legally defined areas containing Protection Level 4
resources. Only authorized personnel, designated by a unit commander, have access to controlled
areas.
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)—As defined in Airfield Operation Instructions, any
portion of the airfield requiring aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians to obtain specific Air Traffic
Control Tower (ATCT) approval for (normally via two-way radio contact with the ATCT).
Controlled Movement Areas include but are not limited to areas used for takeoff, landing and as
required taxiing of aircraft. Note: This definition is used in lieu of "movement area" as defined
in the FAA Pilot Controller Glossary. Also called CMA.
Controlled Movement Area Violation (CMAV) Event—An airfield infraction caused by
aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians entering the control movement area without specific ATCT
approval. This definition includes runway incursions and infractions caused by communication
errors. Refer to AFI 91-223 paragraphs 1.3.1.8. for reportable HATR reporting procedures and
1.3.1.9. for reportable CMAV events.
Expedite—Used by ATC when prompt compliance is required to avoid the development of an
imminent situation.
Foreign Object Damage (FOD)—Any damage to an aircraft, engine, aircraft system,
component, tire, munitions, or support equipment caused by a foreign object(s) which may or
AFI13-213_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 25 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                    53


may not degrade the required safety and/or operational characteristics of the aforementioned
items.

or for you to hold at the Runway Hold line/VFR hold line prior to receiving approval into the
CMA.
Host Wing Commander—The individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
Hot Spot—A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Immediately—Used by ATC when such action compliance is required to avoid an imminent

Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect. Instrument hold line is marked in
retro-reflective yellow paint.
Light Gun—A handheld directional light signaling device which emits a brilliant narrow beam
of white, green, or red light as selected by the tower controller. The color and type of light
transmitted can be used to approve or disapprove anticipated pilot actions where radio
communication is not available. The light gun is used for controlling traffic operating in the
vicinity of the airport and on the airport movement area.

security protection level. Marked with signs prior to entering, Red Lines will indicate the
boundaries.
Roger—I understand and have received all of your transmission.
Runway—A defined rectangular area on an airfield prepared for the landing and takeoff of
aircraft.
Runway Hold line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect.
Runway Incursion—Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-
off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.
These are further classified into three operational categories:
   1) Operational Error (OE)—A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of
separation.
   2) Pilot Deviation (PD)—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC
instructions, AFIs and/or FARs.
   3) Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation(V/PD)—Any entry or movement on the controlled
movement area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not
been authorized by Air Traffic Control.
Say Again—Used to request a repeat of the last transmission. Usually specifies transmission
was not understood or received.
Stand By—To pause while other duties of a higher priority are attended to. Also means to
standby for clearance/approval.
Taxilane—Ramp space between rows of parked aircraft used to maneuver aircraft to and from
parking spots and taxiways.
Taxiway—A paved surface for taxiing aircraft from parking ramp to runway.
Unit—For the purpose of this AFI, the term unit is equivalent to a Squadron, also known as the
basic unit in the USAF organizational structure. Squadrons are usually made up of several
flights (typically four), and commanded by a field grade officer.
Wake Turbulence—A phenomenon resulting from the passage of an aircraft through the
atmosphere. The term includes vortices, thrust stream turbulence, jet blast, jet wash, propeller
wash, and rotor wash both on the ground and in the air.
