1. PROGRAM OVERVIEW.
   1.1. OBJECTIVES.
The Civilian Physical Fitness and Wellness Program is designed to encourage civilian employees
to become physically active and promote a healthier workforce. This program offers an
opportunity for civilians to make a lifestyle change and incorporate health and fitness into their
day. Fitness activities will address cardiovascular/aerobic endurance, muscular strength,
flexibility and body composition. Wellness programs include health education classes for
nutrition, exercise, stress and weight management, and tobacco cessation. The Air Force
 2                                                                62AWI36-815 20 MARCH 2014


encourages active participation in fitness activities and anticipates enhanced productivity and
improved morale among participants.
     1.2. PARTICIPATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
This guidance provides Commanders the discretion to implement the policy based upon mission
requirements. Participation is strictly voluntary and supervisors will have the authority to
approve participation and revoke privileges if any abuse is identified and is not promptly
corrected. The supervisor/timekeeper is required to show physical fitness time on the attendance
records with appropriate coding (LN) for excused absence and Environmental/Hazard code “PF”,
which requires the supervisor’s certification. Because the employee is on “official time”, it is the
supervisor’s responsibility to ensure the employee is where they agreed to be and doing what
they agreed to be doing.
     1.3. ELIGIBILITY.
Open to all full time, Air Force civilian employees on other than temporary appointment (i.e.
permanent and Term). Employees on temporary appointments are excluded. Participation in the
Civilian Physical Fitness Program is a privilege, not a right.
     1.4. HEALTH AND FITNESS ASSESSMENT.
Each participant is required to complete the Request for Approval of Excused Absence and
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for Physical Fitness Activities (Attachment 2) as well as
the PAR-Q & YOU Questionnaire (Attachment 3) prior to being considered for the Civilian
Physical Fitness Program. If one or more questions is answered “yes”, on the PAR-Q & YOU
Questionnaire, the employee must provide a doctor’s statement (at employees own expense) that
physical fitness activities are permitted and identifying any limiting conditions.
     1.5. USE OF DUTY TIME AND ON-BASE FACILITIES.
Civilian employees may be excused from duty for physical fitness activities up to three (3) hours
per week based on mission and workload requirements. The three (3) hours of fitness time may
be spread throughout five (5) days or used in three days. Only one block of time per day is
authorized under this program. A block of time is a segment of not less than fifteen minutes nor
longer than ninety minutes, (i.e. 15,30,45,60, etc.). This time will not be accumulated and
carried over to another work week. This time includes any travel time, changing of clothes and
showering. The use of duty time for this program is authorized under AFI 36-815, paragraph
8.1.1 and will be considered similar to other OPM approved health promotion activities such as
smoking cessation classes for civilian employees. In order to maintain the integrity of this
program, fitness activities will only be performed on base or in base facilities. Base facilities will
be available to employees in accordance with the current installation policy.
2. GENERAL GUIDELINES.
     2.1. Use of duty time (excused absence) is appropriate only if approved by the second level
     supervisor in accordance with procedures. Mission impact is the key element in making this
     decision. Normally, overtime, compensatory time, and credit hours may not be approved nor
     earned on days when use of duty time is authorized under this program.
     2.2. Employee is required to show physical fitness time, in their time and attendance records,
     with appropriate time coding “LN” for excused absence with the Environmental/Hazard code
     “PF”, which requires both the employee’s and the supervisor’s certification.
62AWI36-815 20 MARCH 2014                                                                           3


  2.3. Employees with documented attendance or leave abuse issues will be prohibited from
  participating in the civilian fitness program.
  2.4. Employees may challenge decisions to deny the excused absence only if the denial was
  either arbitrary or capricious.
  2.5. PAR-Q & YOU questionnaire and employee MOU must be re-validated annually.
3. EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES.
  3.1. Ensure the supervisor is provided with a completed, signed and dated, Request for
  Approval of Excused Absence and Memorandum of Understanding for Physical Fitness
  Activities (Attachment 2).
  3.2. Provide the supervisor with a completed, signed and dated, PAR-Q & You
  questionnaire. If one or more questions is answered “yes”, on the PAR-Q & YOU
  Questionnaire the employee must provide a doctor’s statement (at employees own expense)
  that physical fitness activities are permitted and identifying any limiting conditions.
  3.3. Include the activity(ies) employee intends to pursue and the facility(ies) that the
  employee intends to utilize.
  3.4. Submit the Request for Approval of Excused Absence and Memorandum of
  Understanding for Physical Fitness Activities and the PAR-Q & You questionnaire through
  the first line supervisor to second line supervisor for final approval/disapproval (unless the 1st
  line is the unit commander).
4. SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBLITIES.
  4.1. Determine if mission requirements will allow participation, and to suspend participation
  for short periods of time, or cancel approval if mission requirements change.
  4.2. Suspend participation if overtime is being worked.
  4.3. Ensure that employees utilize fitness time to engage in bona fide fitness activities only.
  4.4. File the request for physical fitness time in the Supervisory Record of Employee (AF
  Form 971 ) whether approved or disapproved (the doctor’s statement should be filed with the
  request).
  4.5. Prior to beginning the program, provide a copy of both the request and doctor’s
  statement to the CPS for review and retention.
  4.6. Ensure that the employee re-validates the employee MOU and PAR-Q & You
  Questionnaire annually.

my own expense, stating that physical fitness activities are permitted with or without limiting
conditions, if I answered ‘yes’ to one or more of the seven questions on the PAR-Q form.

_____ Time granted to engage in the PFP is a privilege, not a right, and that use of this time must
be balanced with my obligation to accomplish my workload.

authorized to allow me up to three (3) hours of excused absence per week, during which I may
participate in fitness activities that have been approved for the PFP and for which I have medical
