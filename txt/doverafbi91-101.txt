This Dover Air Force Base Instruction (DAFBI) implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD)
91-1, Nuclear Weapons and Systems Surety and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 91-101, Air Force
Nuclear Weapons Surety Program. This instruction is the nuclear surety portion of the wing
mishap prevention plan. It provides guidance and establishes a program for reporting
deficiencies of nuclear-certified equipment as DULL-SWORD Material Deficiency Reports
(MDRs) In Accordance With (IAW) Technical Order (T.O.) 00-35D-54, United States Air Force
(USAF) Deficiency Reporting, Investigation, and Resolution, AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations
and Reports, and Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and
Reports. It applies to all base organizations that operate or perform maintenance on general
purpose, special purpose, and material handling equipment that are nuclear safety certification.
Tasked organizations may develop operating instructions (OI) in support of this instruction. If
unit-level OIs are developed, provide a copy to the Wing Safety (436 AW/SE). Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF IMT 847s from the field through the appropriate functionals chain of command.
