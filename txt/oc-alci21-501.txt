This instruction implements and extends the guidance of AFI 21-101_AFMCSUP1, Aircraft and
Equipment Maintenance Management, procedures governing identification of metal material
responsibilities within the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex (OC-ALC). This Oklahoma
City Air Logistics Complex (OC-ALC) instruction establishes procedures and responsibilities for
submission of metals used in manufacturing processes to the 76th Maintenance Support
Squadron, Analytical Chemistry Section (76 MXSS/MXDTAA) for chemical analysis. This
instruction applies to the 76th Aircraft Maintenance Group (76 AMXG), the 76th Propulsion
Maintenance Group (76 PMXG), the 76th Commodities Maintenance Group (76 CMXG), and 76
MXSS/MXDTAA. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed IAW the Air Force Record Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm or as required by Title V
operating permit. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the office
of primary responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s
chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been updated to reflect administrative changes of 76 MXW to OC-ALC
nomenclatures. This publication should be read in its entirety.

1. Scope. This instruction covers definitions, references, and responsibilities for metals for
Federal Supply Class (FSC) 9500, 4700 and 3439 used in the manufacturing processes.
2. Definitions.
     2.1. Identification Marking Methods: One of three methods permitted by technical order
     (TO) 42D-1-3, Method of Identifying Steel, Aluminum, and Copper Alloys in Air Force Stock,
     for the identification of metal stock material. These methods in order of preference are:
        2.1.1. Stencil Marking.
        2.1.2. Color Code Marking.
        2.1.3. Metal Die Code Stamping.
     2.2. Stencil Marking: Permanent marking using a sheet, of plastic or cardboard, in which
     the alloy identification has been cut so that ink or paint applied to the sheet will reproduce
     the identification on the metal surface. TO 42D-1-3 states that this is the preferred method of
     applying a marking.
     2.3. Color Code Marking: Marking in which a series of color bands represent numbers and
     letters to denote material composition, temper, physical, and/or surface condition.
     2.4. Metal Die Code Stamping: A set of engraved metal pieces used for impressing
     numbers and letters denoting the composition, temper, and specification onto the metal item.
     TO 42D-1-3 states that this method shall only be used where facilities are not available or
     size will not permit the application of one of the other methods.
     2.5. Permanent Marking: Physical item marking such that it shall not rub off or be
     otherwise effaced by contact incident to normal handling, exposure to the elements,
     shipment, and storage.
3. Responsibilities:
     3.1. Production Maintenance Groups (76 AMXG/76 PMXG/76 CMXG) shall:
        3.1.1. Assure shop service center (SSC)/weapon system support center (WSSC)
        personnel check all metal stock material upon receipt from supplier for proper
        identification markings. Properly identified packages where individual items were not
        marked by the manufacturer will be marked by SSC/WSSC personnel at the time of
        receipt.
        3.1.2. Assure production personnel do not accept metal stock material from SSC/WSSC
        that does not bear positive identification. Inspect identification markings on bench stock
        prior to use. Metal stock material in excess of manufacture requirements will be
        identified and marked according to TO 42D-1-3 by production personnel and then
        returned to the SSC/WSSC. If material cannot be specifically identified as to
        composition, temper, and specification, a sample will be routed to 76 MXSS/MXDTAA
        for analysis and identification before the material is issued, used, or stored in the
        SSC/WSSC.
        3.1.3. Submit representative material sample, no less than 1-inch long by 1-inch wide by
        ¼-inch thick, and send it to the 76 MXSS/MXDTAA for analysis and proper
        identification. Submit a sample when a non-conformance is suspected; and/or there is a
OC-ALCI21-501 2 OCTOBER 2014                                                               3


     question as to whether the material meets special criteria as established on the drawing
     for the item being manufactured; or when the drawing specifically calls for
     metallurgical/chemical analysis. Planning organizations will include a requirement on
     Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) Form 959, Work Control Document (WCD), for
     sending metal samples for lab testing prior to use in manufacture if the material
     discrepancy rate or criticality warrants such action.
     3.1.4. Complete an AFMC Form 127, Routed Order, for each sample submitted. The
     form shall include the job order number (JON) assigned to the production organization
     requesting the analysis. Samples from different metal stock pieces submitted at the same
     time shall be individually bagged with properly completed form in each bag. It is not
     necessary to submit more than one sample from a single piece of metal stock. Multiple
     samples in the same bag will be considered to have come from the same metal stock
     piece and will be treated as one sample analysis request. Requesting organization will
     deliver samples to 76 MXSS, Lab Support Section (76 MXSS/MXDTAE), building 3001,
     post I-68.
     3.1.5. Assure that material cut in such a manner that the identification markings are no
     longer present on any pieces will immediately replace the missing markings by any one
     of the three methods specified in TO 42D-1-3.
     3.1.6. Tag material with Department of Defense (DD) Form 1575, Suspended Tag-
     Material, when laboratory analysis shows material is misidentified or is unsuitable for
     intended use. The material will then be returned to supplier for credit or replacement.
  3.2. The Analytical Chemistry Section (76 MXSS/MXDTAA) will:
     3.2.1. Perform chemical analysis of each sample of metal stock material submitted by a
     production division to make positive identification.
     3.2.2. Prepare a written laboratory report in memorandum format with the proper
     identification of the metal stock material and notify the customer when report is
     completed. A completed copy of AFMC Form 127 will be attached. Requesting
     organization will pick up report and sample from 76 MXSS/MXDTAA, building 3001,
     post 2I-63. When priority testing is requested, 76 MXSS/MXDTAA will telephone
     requesting organization when report is ready for pickup. Reports will be mailed using
     base distribution upon request.
