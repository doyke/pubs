SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Paragraph numbers were changed to fall in line with the basic publication. Changed paragraph
4.2.1.1 to indicate that units will turn in excess XB3 assets to Inspection Section (366
LRS/LGRMI). Paragraph 4.2.2.2 was changed to indicate units will turn in unserviceable
consumable materiel to DRMS DSR or MEO (for cross-docking). Paragraph 9.4.2.2 gave 366
MSG/CC/CD delegated the authority to approve SPRAM authorizations to the applicable
Maintenance Squadron Commanders under the 366th Maintenance Group.
1. 18. Organization Refusals. The 366th Logistics Readiness Squadron Commander (366
LRS/CC) has opted to process reverse-post actions (RVP) in lieu of credit turn-in for ERRC XB
or N Organizational Refusals.
2.5.3. For disposal of unserviceable/not-useable XB3 material, all groups have been given a
block of serial numbers to utilize for turning property into the DSR directly (refer to AFMAN
23-110V2PT2CH11/MHAFB Sup for list of serial numbers). Units are required to maintain
signed     source    documents       for     2    years     IAW     AFRIMS         located  at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.
Table 3C3.1. Purpose. To ensure all due-outs are validated monthly, each unit will review the
Due-out Validation Listing (M-30) and email a copy of the listing with required actions to
Customer Service for processing within 5 working days of report. If no action is required, units
will annotate “No Actions Required” on listing and e-mail to Customer Service within specified
time period above. Follow validation requirements as identified in Table 3C3.1..
Table 3D1.1. Bench Stock Responsibilities (Customer & LRS Supply Activity).
Organizational bench stock monitors may input routine bench stock replenishment (1BS)
requests.
4.2.1.1. Base activities will turn in all serviceable excess XB3 material to 366 LRS/LGRMI
(Inspection) with a DD Form 1574 attached and appropriate organization and shop code
annotated on form along with POC and telephone number. If Inspection determines more
information or action is required, they will contact the POC for resolution. If property needs to
be returned to originator for more actions, originator will pick up their own property from 366
LRS/LGRMI. If units do not have a vehicle available to transport materiel they may request
assistance through 366 LRS/LGRDDO at DSN: 728-2215.
4.2.1.2. The 366 LRS/LGRMMF (Flight Service Center) is the designated turn-in point for
DIFM items.
4.2.1.6. (ACC Sup) Due to Mountain Home AFB ID being designated an "impacted site"
during the DRMO A-76 action where the DSR from Hill AFB UT pre-screens property once
each month, 366 MSG/CC/CD determined customers will deliver their own unserviceable
consumable materiel/scrap to DRMS DSR or Most Efficient Organization (MEO).
4.2.2. Customers (generators) will transfer unserviceable/not-useable XB3 material directly to
DRMS if it falls into one of the categories referenced in Attachment 4B-4 (basic). The DSR
will downgrade to scrap.

9.4.2.2. The 366 MSG/CC/CD delegated the authority to approve SPRAM authorizations to the
applicable Maintenance Squadron Commanders under the 366th Maintenance Group.
