   Patterson AFB OH 45433-7913 for analysis.
   3.7.5. If the above tests reveal the presence of 0.005 microcuries or more of removable
   contamination, the permittee will immediately notify IRSO and withdraw the sealed source
   from use and arrange for it to be decontaminated and repaired or disposed of in accordance
   with the waste disposal procedures.
3.8. Emergency Procedures.
   3.8.1. Emergencies include any unusual occurrences that result in contamination of facilities
   or environment, or that may result in the exposure of personnel to hazardous levels of
   ionizing or non-ionizing radiation. BE must be notified immediately of all these
   emergencies.
   3.8.2. IRSO, BE, or delegate will be directly involved with all investigations and reporting
   of accidents and incidents involving radioactive materials. The Occupational Medicine
   Consultant will be informed of all ongoing investigations. The IRSO will report the findings
   to the OEHWG. All reporting and investigations will be per the applicable sections of AFI
   91-202, The U.S. Mishap Prevention Program; AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and
   Reports; AFI 40-201; and TO 00-110N-3. Reporting under AFI 91-204 does not negate the
   reporting requirements of AFI 40-201 and the NRC.
   3.8.3. Treat any RAM spill as a major spill until monitoring can be accomplished to
   determine the actual intensity of the radiation exposure.
   3.8.4. Fire fighting procedures are as follows:
      3.8.4.1. The fighting of fires, which may occur in buildings, must be accomplished in
      such a manner that exposure of personnel to radiation is held to a minimum and the
      spread of radioactive contamination is avoided.
      3.8.4.2. As a general rule, when using fire hoses, water fog is preferable to solid stream
      application to avoid excessive runoff of water that may spread contamination.
      3.8.4.3. If a fire breaks out, sound the evacuation alarm, call 911, and notify BE of its
      location. If no immediate radiation hazard exists and the potential for sustaining injuries
      is remote, combat the fire using the nearest fire extinguisher, sand, or water. If there is
      sufficient time, personnel who are using isotopes and are not in the fire area should
      quickly place their isotopes into storage containers, transport containers from the area,
      then close the windows and doors, and shut off the ventilation system before leaving the
      area.
      3.8.4.4. Firefighters must wear protective clothing and respiratory equipment even
      though there is no evidence of immediate radiation danger. If possible, fire fighting
      should be conducted from the upwind side of the blaze. If time allows, firefighters will
      be issued TLDs and EPDs by BE personnel.
   3.8.5. Accidental peacetime exposure to radioactive material (non-wartime or terrorist
   attack):
      3.8.5.1. Remain calm. Accidental exposure to medically significant radiation is not
      possible with the items present on SAFB.
SHEPPARDAFBI48-106 5 FEBRUARY 2014                                                         13


     3.8.5.2. Notify BE as soon as possible by calling 676-3080 or BE on-call cell phone 940-
     882-5031.
     3.8.5.3. A person known or suspected to have ingested or inhaled any quantity of
     radioactive material will be transported immediately for medical evaluation. The
     individual will not present a radiation hazard to emergency response personnel.
     3.8.5.4. A person with radioactive particulate contamination on their clothing should
     slowly remove the affected garment (to limit producing airborne dust). Place the garment
     in any expedient container, preferably a plastic bag if available. If particulate
     contamination is suspected on bare skin, thoroughly rinse the area with water. Additional
     decontamination may be conducted by Fire Department.

A2.1. ALARA – As Low As Reasonable Achievable concept. ALARA is defined as that set of
management and administrative actions taken to reduce personnel ionizing radiation exposure to
as low a level as possible consistent with existing technology, costs, and operational
requirements.
A2.2. Controlled Area – An area outside of a restricted area but inside the site boundary, access
to which can be limited by the licensee for any reason.
Controlled area – Any area where radioisotopes are used or stored and to which access is limited to
reduce exposure of individuals to radiation. In the case of non-ionizing radiation, controlled areas
are those that may be occupied by personnel who accept potential exposure as concomitant of
employment or duties; by individuals who knowingly enter areas where levels above the permissible
exposure limits (PEL), defined in AFOSHSTD 48-9, Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR) Safety
Program, are to be expected; and by personnel passing through such areas.
A2.3. Electromagnetic radiation - A term used to mean non-ionizing radiation in the frequency
range from about 10 kilohertz (kHz) to 300 gigahertz (GHz).
A2.4. Microcuries – One-millionth of a curie. A curie is a term designating a quantity of
radioactive material present; 1 curie is the amount of radioactive material required to produce 37
billion disintegrations per second. Because radioisotopes decay at different rates, the amount of
a specific radioactive element that represents a curie is different for each element.
A2.5. Millirem – One-thousandth of roentgen equivalent man (rem). A rem is a unit of absorbed
radiation by human beings. Radiation standards are normally expressed in millirem (mrem) or
rem per unit of time.
A2.6. Probe surveys – Measurements using portable survey meter to detect alpha, beta, gamma,
neutrons, or x-ray radiation.
A2.7. Radiation dosimeter program. – A program described in AFI 48-125, The US Air Force
Personnel Dosimetry Program, for routinely monitoring personnel who work with radiation
producing devices and who may receive radiation doses in excess of 10% of the applicable
radiation standard.
A2.8. RAM – Radioactive material.
A2.9. Restricted Area – An area, access to which is limited by the licensee for the purpose of
protecting individuals against undue risks from exposure to radiation and radioactive materials.
Thermoluminescent badges and self-reading pocket dosimeters will be worn in ionizing radiation
areas.
A2.10. Self-reading Pocket Dosimeter – A radiation detection device normally worn by an
individual and designed to detect and quantitatively measure x-ray and gamma radiation. These
dosimeters are not as accurate as thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD), but they can be read by
the wearer and give a good indication of received radiation dose. If issued, they are to be worn
concurrently with TLDs.

A2.11. Swipe samples – Samples using filter paper to detect removable radioactive material.
Filter paper is smeared across suspected contaminated areas.
A2.12. TLD (Thermoluminescent Dosimeter) – A radiation detection device normally worn
by an individual and designed to detect and quantitatively measure beta, gamma, x-ray, and, if
required, neutron radiation.
