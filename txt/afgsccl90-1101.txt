 This Inspection Checklist implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-2, Inspector
 General --The Inspection System, 26 April 2006, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 90-201, Inspector
 General Activities, 17 June 2009, and AFI 90-201_AFGSCSUP, Addendum J, Unit Compliance
 Inspections, 1 February 2010. This checklist (CL) reflects AFGSC UH-1N requirements to
 prepare for and conduct internal reviews, staff assistance visits, compliance inspections. It
 complements instructions and supplements governing operations (AFI 11-2UH-1NV3, UH-1N
 Helicopter Operations Procedures), training (AFI 11-2UH-1NV1, UH-1N Helicopter Aircrew
 Training), standardization and evaluation (AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation
 Program), life support (AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Life Support Program) and aviation resource
 management (AFI 11-401, Aviation Management and AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource
 Management) and implements the guidance found in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities,
 and the AFGSC supplement to it. Effective unit self-inspections serve as the foundation for
 commanders to ensure compliance with governing directives. This checklist applies to
 Headquarters (HQ) Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Twentieth Air Force (20 AF),
 AFGSC space and missile operations units with assigned UH-1N helicopter units and AFGSC
 UH-1N Helicopter Squadrons. This checklist does not apply to Air National Guard units or Air

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This interim change implements new guidelines that clarify the AFGSC Inspector General
Inspection Checklist requirements, corrects the short title to reflect the 90 series numbering.
This checklist has been revised to update checklist requirements.
1. References have been provided for all items. Critical items have been kept to a minimum and
are related to public law, safety, security, fiscal responsibility and/or mission accomplishment.
2. This publication establishes a baseline guide to be used by units during their self-inspection
process. The Command IG will use this checklist during applicable assessments. Items
designated as Critical require direct IG evaluation per AFI90-201. Non-compliance with an item
designated as Critical does not necessarily equate to a critical deficiency during an IG inspection.
AFGSC checklists will not be supplemented. Units produce their own stand-alone checklists, as
needed, to ensure an effective and thorough review of the unit program. See Attachment 1,
Table A1.1. Checklist.
