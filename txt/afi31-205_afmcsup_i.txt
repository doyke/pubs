                                              Chapter 1

              PROGRAM PURPOSE, GUIDELINES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. (REPLACE) Program Purpose. The Air Force Corrections System (AFCS) provides
quality confinement/corrections and rehabilitation services. Pre-trial detainees pending a court-
martial and inmates serving a court-martial sentence are the primary system recipients. The
AFCS ensures a secure, humane and productive environment for confinees and staff. The AFCS
provides for confinee education, training, rehabilitation and welfare. Those not retained for
further military service have the opportunity to return to society as a responsible and productive
citizen. The AFCS is committed to ensuring that crime victims and witnesses are afforded all the
rights and privileges to which they are entitled under law. The AFCS will strive to ensure all
Victim Witness Assistance Program (VWAP) requirements are met.
1.2. Program Guidelines. The AFCS is based on a corrective rather than punitive basis. It
requires positive programs to preserve and strengthen an inmate’s dignity. Inmates receive
sentences to confinement as punishment not for punishment.
     1.2.1. (REPLACE) . Air Force inmates serve sentences of confinement under the Uniform
     Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Pre-trial detainees are confined pursuant to a pre-trial
     confinement order. Pre-trial confinement is not punishment and pre-trial detainees shall not
     be punished for the offense which is the basis for their restraint.
     1.2.2. (REPLACE) . Pre-trial detainees or inmates in Department of Defense (DoD) or
     non-DoD correctional institutions are subject to that institution’s rules or directives including
     uniforms, discipline and treatment.
        1.2.2.1. (REPLACE) . The installation commander may authorize use of civilian
        facilities (federal, state, county, city and private contract) to incarcerate pre-trial detainees
        and inmates. Facilities must be approved or accredited by one of the following: American
        Correctional Association, American Jail Association, or by the state or federal
        governments. (A list of the federally approved facilities may be obtained from the nearest
        US Marshal’s office.)
            1.2.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Facility approval/accreditation will be noted in the next
            Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to include who the approval/accreditation is
            from, date of approval/accreditation, and date of reaccreditation. In the interim a
            memo will suffice for this requirement.
            1.2.2.1.2. (Added-AFMC) The MOA should state the facility is required to
            immediately notify the installation in the event they do not receive
            approval/reaccreditation or in the event for any reason the approval/accreditation is
            revoked.
        1.2.2.2. (REPLACE) . Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). Any circumstance that
        would cause an anticipated incarceration at a location other than the parent installation
        requires a written MOA. Reasons for an installation to have a MOA in effect include, but
        are not limited to, the lack of an organic correctional facility, lack of bed space, the
        gender of the inmate, special needs of the inmate, etc. Emergency and unusual
        circumstances that would preclude the ability to properly execute a MOA will be
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                               9


     coordinated through HQ AFSFC/SFC for assistance. If possible, HQ AFSFC/SFC will
     assist with placement and transfer of pre-trial detainees and inmates not covered by an
     existing MOA. The parent installation still retains responsibility to secure appropriate
     facilities.
        1.2.2.2.1. (REPLACE) . Possible alternatives for housing Air Force pre-trial
        detainees and inmates are: civilian operated correctional facilities and jails, private
        correctional facilities and jails under contract to a civilian government agency, private
        correctional facilities and jails, other DoD/sister service correctional facilities and
        other Air Force correctional facilities.
            1.2.2.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) All         AFMC        installations  will  establish
            Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) with local agencies to house inmates that
            cannot be housed in the installation facility. A copy of all approved MOAs and
            contracts will be coordinated with and forwarded to HQ AFMC/A7SO.
        1.2.2.2.2. (REPLACE) . All MOAs must be in writing and should detail
        responsibilities and services. Consult AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures,
        for guidance. The standards of confinement and treatment of inmates and pre-trial
        detainees confined at non-DoD correctional institutions must meet or exceed those set
        by the American Correctional Association, American Jail Association, or the state or
        federal government agency that accredited or approved the facility.
            1.2.2.2.2.1. (REPLACE) . Suggested standards to be requested when
            negotiating a MOA with a non-DoD correctional facility should include, but not
            be limited to, separation of pre-trial detainees and post trial inmates, separation of
            offenders who committed minor offenses from those who committed serious
            offenses, facility condition and cleanliness.
            1.2.2.2.2.2. (REPLACE) . MOA negotiations should ensure accessibility to pre-
            trial detainees and inmates by unit, legal and chaplain personnel, etc., and the
            ability of the facility to temporarily release and/or re-confine pre-trial detainees or
            inmates as needed.
                1.2.2.2.2.2.1. (Added-AFMC) The Defense Force Commander (DFC) will
                send a letter providing the status of all valid MOAs or contracts with facilities
                outside of the DoD to HQ AFMC/A7SO, NLT 15 January or as
                changes/updates occur.
        1.2.2.2.3. (REPLACE) . Normally, all transfers of inmates internal to AFCS will be
        approved and facilitated by HQ AFSFC/SFC.
            1.2.2.2.3.1. (DELETE)
            1.2.2.2.3.2. (DELETE)
        1.2.2.2.4. (REPLACE) . Establish MOAs with base installation support agencies,
        i.e., Chaplain, Services (dining facility) and Mental Health Services, to maintain
        consistency of support service(s) for the confinement/correctional facility, when
        facility requires assistance above the normal level of service.
        1.2.2.2.5. (REPLACE) . Costs associated with housing and escort(s) when
        transferring a confinee will be the parent unit’s responsibility using Operation and
 10                                              AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


          Maintenance (O & M) funds. Transfers into the AFCS is paid by PCS ID code E,
          covered in paragraph 9.9
          1.2.2.2.6. (DELETE)
   1.2.3. (REPLACE) . Do not use confinement/corrections personnel or facilities or
   Remotivation Program (ne: Correctional Custody). Do not allow Remotivation Program
   Correctees to have direct contact with confined pre-trial detainees or inmates. See also
   paragraph 11.6.9.2
   1.2.4. (REPLACE) . The Air Force confines personnel in facilities that prevent immediate
   association with enemy prisoners of war or foreign nationals who are not members of the US
   Armed Forces.
   1.2.5. (REPLACE) . The installation commander may approve, on a case-by-case basis,
   temporary use of their confinement/corrections facilities to house transient confines under the
   control of civilian law enforcement officers. Do not use military personnel as guards for the
   transients.
   1.2.6. (REPLACE) . All inmates receive fair and humane treatment according to laws,
   instructions, directives and consistency with custody requirements.
   1.2.7. (REPLACE) . AFCS consists of three levels of facilities: Level I, Level II and Level
   III. See Attachment 1 for definitions.

         is expressly prohibited.
         1.3.13.4.2. Physical abuse, hazing, use of unnecessary force and any form of corporal
         punishment by a staff member are prohibited.
         1.3.13.4.3. Striking or laying hands upon inmates is prohibited except in self-defense,
         to prevent serious injury to self or others, to prevent serious damage to property, to
         effect an authorized search, or to quell a disturbance. In such cases, the amount of
         force used will be the minimum amount necessary to bring the situation under
         control.
         1.3.13.4.4. Staff members are prohibited from bartering, giving, or selling any item
         or service to inmates and prohibited from permitting others to conduct such activities.
         1.3.13.4.5. Staff members are prohibited from extending privileges, favored
         assignments, or information to individual inmates that are not similarly available to
         all inmates.

         inmates and staff members. Staff members are expected to treat inmates in a fair, firm
         and consistent manner.
         1.3.13.4.10. Sexual harassment is prohibited. This behavior interferes with an
         individual's performance and creates an intimidating, hostile and offensive
         environment. Whether an inmate, detainee, or staff member, sexual harassment denies
         the individual respect and dignity and is contrary to the mission of the facility.
  1.3.14. The Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) provides the confinement officer with legal
  interpretation, guidance on confinement matters and information concerning the offenses, for
  inclusion in the inmate’s DD Form 2710-1, Inmate Sentence Information.

                 ORGANIZATION, STAFFING AND STAFF TRAINING

2.1. Organization. The installation CSF assigns a commissioned officer, in writing, as the
confinement officer. This position may be an additional duty. The confinement NCOs are
operationally responsible to the confinement officer.
   2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) AFMC units will forward the designation letter to HQ
   AFMC/A7SO. The Operations Officer should normally be designated the corrections officer.
2.2. Staffing. The installation CSF reviews staffing for their Level 1 facility at least annually.
MAJCOMs establish manpower requirements for Level 1 CFs and RCFs, IAW AF Manpower
Standards for Security Forces, assigned to their command. HQ AFSFC/SFC determines Air
Force personnel (i.e., staff) assigned to Level 2 and 3 facilities. Staffing requirements for AFCS
facilities should be determined on more than (projected) inmate population figures and should
include a review of staffing needs, as well as, mission requirements.
   2.2.1. Staff members must be E-4 or above and a 5-skill level.
   2.2.2. Staff members must demonstrate and possess a high degree of maturity and emotional
   stability.
       2.2.2.1. For personnel to work as confinement/corrections staff members, they must not
       have the following: active Unfavorable Information File (UIF), civilian felony
       conviction, or courts-martial conviction. If trained confinement/corrections personnel are
       tasked with other duties not in support of the facility, those duties should not degrade or
       otherwise compromise security of the facility.
       2.2.2.2. Personnel other than 3P0X1, used to supervise and/or guard inmates must meet
       the requirements in paragraph 2.2.2.1
   2.2.3. Personnel of the opposite sex may supervise or guard inmate(s). This arrangement
   must not result in undue invasion of the inmate(s) privacy as determined by the confinement
   officer. NOTE: See Chapter 9 for escort procedures.
2.3. Training. Confinement/corrections positions are designated as critical duty positions.
Confinement officers and confinement NCOs, with or without organic facilities, will establish a
structured training program in conjunction with the unit SFT. The training program will be
designed to ensure all personnel assigned confinement/corrections duties are fully trained in
custody, control, management, VWAP, sex offender registration/notification and correctional
treatment of inmates. Additional in-house training is encouraged. Trainers will document and
maintain entries in AF Form 623a, OJT Records, on all 3P0X1 personnel performing duties
involving inmates. Confinement NCOs must do one of the following within 6 months of duty
assignment: complete the AF Corrections ADL, a service corrections course; complete a civilian
equivalent course; or complete the American Correctional Association (ACA) Correctional
Officer course. NOTE: It is highly recommended all personnel performing
confinement/corrections duties be afforded the opportunity to complete continuation training
(i.e., ACA Correctional Officer/ Supervisor/Mid-Manager correspondence courses).
   2.3.1. Initial and recurring training programs, should contain as a minimum:
 16                                               AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010

      2.3.1.7. The function and relationship of referral agencies (legal office, clinic, behavioral
      health, finance, etc.).
      2.3.1.8. Suicide prevention. All CFs and RCFs will have a detailed suicide prevention
      plan that addresses each of the following: training, identification, communication,
      intervention, reporting, follow-up and review. (For units with organic facilities.)
      2.3.1.9. Victim/Witness and sex offender requirements.
      2.3.1.10. Inmate rulebook. All staff will be thoroughly familiar with the rules of
      detainee/inmate conduct, discipline and control measures available (paragraph 8.8) and
      the rationale for the rules. (For units with organic facilities.)
   2.3.2. Lesson plans should be developed for each subject of instruction. HQ AFSFC/SFC has
   training videos with lesson plans and testing material, which may be loaned to units. Ensure
   training is documented in training records.
   2.3.3. Non-3P0XX personnel performing duties in any capacity (i.e., guard, work details and
   escorts) will have training documented. Maintain this documentation, i.e., computerized
   spreadsheet, log, general-purpose form, at the facility for 90 days.
2.4. Management          of    Human  Immunodeficiency     Virus     (HIV)     Positive
Inmates. Confinement officers ensure a comprehensive education and training program is
available for staff and inmates.
   2.4.1. Training includes measures to protect against HIV transmission. Design the training to
   preclude rumors, correct misinformation, calm fears and provide current factual information.
   Contact the military public health office regularly to update information.
   2.4.2. Staff training topics should include:
      2.4.2.1. Apprehension and search.

   prisoners during non-duty hours. Include the responsibilities pertaining to the corrections
   program in the individual's standardization evaluation (Stan-Eval).
2.5. Custody and Control of HIV Positive Inmates. An inmate’s HIV positive status is not a
consideration for transfer requirements unless deemed necessary by medical authorities.
Confinement officers ensure the gaining unit is aware of the HIV positive status of the inmate.
Confinement officers do not separate HIV positive inmates from the general inmate population
based solely on HIV status. Confinement officers also consider the following when planning for
HIV positive inmates.
   2.5.1. Medical authorities may require special handling of contaminated laundry and linen.
   2.5.2. Toilet and shower facilities are no different from those used by other inmates.
   2.5.3. Food service sanitation provisions are no different from those used by other inmates.
2.6. Assessment and Treatment of HIV Positive Inmates. Medical staffs test all HIV
negative inmates annually as scheduled by the confinement officer. The medical facility will
determine post exposure actions.
   2.6.1. The parent unit provides escorts for inmates sent for testing or follow-up care.
   2.6.2. Medical treatment facility personnel arrange transportation as necessary.
   2.6.3. All incidents which could result in transmission of an infectious disease, (i.e., sexual
   contact, tattooing, intravenous drug use, or body-fluid-to-body-fluid transfer), automatically
   require immediate HIV testing of participants unless all participants are HIV positive.
   Medical staffs immediately test all HIV negative inmates and confinement/corrections staff,
   involved in an incident if one or more participants are HIV positive.
   2.6.4. HIV test results are not for public dissemination. As a minimum, the medical facility
   shall notify the parent unit commander, installation CSF and confinement officer of HIV
   positive test results. Only inform confinement/corrections staff members designated by the
   confinement officer as having a need to know which inmates are HIV positive.
   Confinement/corrections staffs do not annotate HIV status in the Correctional Treatment File
   (CTF) or other records unless the confinement officer, as advised by legal and medical
   authorities, directs the entry. Disclosure of an HIV status for official purposes should only be
   discussed with confinement/corrections, medical and dental personnel. Any voluntary
   statements made to that effect by an inmate are documented in military records.
   2.6.5. The confinement officer may direct HIV testing of any inmate at any time considered
   necessary, provided they are able to document the purpose of the testing and its necessity as a
   legitimate penal interest due to close communal living conditions.

                         RECORDS, PROGRAMS AND REPORTS

3.1. Policies/Release of Inmate Records. All files maintenance and disposition of records
(including CTF, VWAP, and Sex Offender) will be IAW AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition
Schedule, Table 31-2.
3.1. (AFMC)Policies/Release of Inmate Records. All files maintenance and disposition of
records (including CTF, VWAP, and Sex Offender) will be IAW AFMAN 37-139, Records
Disposition Schedule, Table 31-2.
   3.1.1. Release of Inmate Records. To the maximum extent possible, all persons associated
   with corrections must protect processes involved in corrections (i.e., VWAP, Sex Offender),
   clemency and parole, restoration and reenlistment in the release of records requested in
   accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or the Privacy Act. Consult DoD
   Regulation 5400.7/AF Supplement, FOIA Program and AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act
   Program, for procedures on release or denial of FOIA and PA requests.
   3.1.2. The Air Force has an exemption under the Privacy Act for all corrections and
   rehabilitation records. 32 C.F.R. §806b.30 (1998) and 5 USC §552a(j)(2)(West 1996)
   contains this exemption. Cite both as the reason for not releasing exempt information.
   3.1.3. Confinement/corrections staff members may release information in corrections and
   rehabilitation records under FOIA unless requested documents or portions of the documents
   fall within exemptions in 5 U.S.C. §552(b). Evaluations and recommendations are usually
   exempt under 5 U.S.C. §552(b)(5).
3.2. Victim/Witness Assistance Program. Local legal offices contact each victim or witness
and determines their desire to participate in the victim/witness notification program. The
confinement officer establishes procedures to protect the rights of victims and witnesses who
elect to participate in the notification process IAW AFI 51-201, Administration of Military
Justice; Public Law 97-291, The Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, October 12, 1982
(18 U.S.C. §§ 1512 et seq., 3579 et seq.); Public Law 101-647, The Crime Control Act of 1990,
November 29, 1990 (42 U.S.C. §§ 5779, 5780 and generally amended Title 18); DoDI 1030.1,
Victim and Witness Assistance; DoDI 1030.2, Victim and Witness Assistance Procedures and this
instruction. HQ Air Force Security Forces Center is designated as the service Central Repository.
   3.2.1. Victim and Witness Participation. Victims or witnesses associated with a particular
   inmate’s case may request notification when there is a change in the inmate’s confinement
   status. When a military member is sentenced to confinement by courts-martial, the trial
   counsel informs victims and witnesses, if any, of their rights to notification. The victim or
   witness elects notification preference using the DD Form 2704, Victim/Witness
   Certification and Election Concerning Inmate Status. The trial counsel, in an urgent and
   timely manner, forwards the DD Form 2704 to the confinement/corrections facility and the
   service Central Repository (CR) at HQ AFSFC/SFC, 1517 Billy Mitchell Boulevard,
   Lackland AFB, TX 78236-0119, in all cases where confinement is adjudged. (NOTE: DD
   Form 2704 is required for all adjudged inmates whether or not a victim or witness is
   identified.) Victims and witnesses are responsible for notifying the confinement/corrections
   facility and the CR of changes in their address/telephone number.
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                             19


  3.2.2. Establishing a Program. Every SF unit located on an installation that conducts courts-
  martials, with or without a confinement/corrections facility, must establish a Victim/Witness
  Assistance Program (VWAP). Provides continuity for the VWAP and sex offender
  notification processes, even in instances when the military member is confined in a civilian
  facility. The confinement records of all those adjudged and sentenced to confinement must
  contain a DD Form 2704, which is completed and provided by the installation legal office in
  an urgent and timely manner. Maintain contact with SJA until the form is received see
  paragraph 3.2.9.1 for reporting instructions when forms are not received. The confinement
  officer appoints the VWAP monitor in writing. The VWAP monitor for the facility must
  understand the importance of this program and be sensitive to the needs of the victims or
  witnesses (i.e., treat with compassion). The VWAP monitor will secure VWAP files and treat
  the information with strict confidentiality releasing on a need-to-know basis. The identity
  (i.e., contact information) of victim/witnesses shall not be disclosed to inmates or any
  unauthorized third party. Ensure emergency action plans provide for immediate access for
  notifications. These procedures apply to inmates of all sister service personnel confined at
  USAF CFs and RCFs. For the purposes of this instruction, the facility VWAP monitor is also
  the Sex Offender Program monitor.
     3.2.2.1. All victim/witness requirements will be included in all facility operating
     instructions and self-inspection checklists.
     3.2.2.2. Each facility victim/witness assistance program will be inspected, as a minimum,
     every three years. Inspections will be accomplished during MAJCOM/IG or HQ
     AFSFC/SFC inspections utilizing HQ AFSFC/SFC provided checklists/inspection
     criteria. This inspection will include, as a minimum, a 20 percent spot check of the
     program through examination of adjunct VWAP files for the inmates confined to ensure
     compliance for program participants. The inspection will verify the DD Form 2705 was
     accomplished for each victim/witness requesting notification by verifying each PS Form
     3811, Domestic Return Receipt, was returned (i.e., stapled to or filed with the DD Form
     2705) or verify the form was suspensed for 14 days CONUS or 30 days for OCONUS, to
     validate a tracking mechanism is in place. Ensure all return receipts are returned.
     Document unreturned receipts, follow up and make reasonable attempts to locate
     unreturned receipts. Contact HQ AFSFC/SFC for further instructions if all attempts fail.
     See paragraph 3.2.3.3 for undeliverable mail requirements.
  3.2.3. Notification Procedures. Trial counsel sends the initial requirement for notification,
  via DD Form 2704, to the confinement/corrections facility and HQ AFSFC/SFC (Central
  Repository). A DD Form 2704 shall be completed and forwarded for all cases resulting in a
  sentence to confinement. The DD Form 2704 is to be sent immediately, i.e., faxed or mailed,
  along with other court documents at the time of confinement following a court-martial. If a
  request for information is received directly from a crime victim or witness by means other
  than a DD Form 2704, the VWAP Monitor will determine if the individual is bona fide
  victim or witness. This can be accomplished by determining if the DD Form 2704 is on file at
  the central repository, or by referring to the appropriate legal office. Upon receipt of the DD
  Form 2704, the individual will be entered into the program. Refer questions from victims and
  witnesses concerning matters other than release or release-related activities to the appropriate
  legal office. DD Form 2704 is required on all inmates (i.e., all services) entering confinement
  IAW AFI 51-201. The date the inmate is eligible for a parole hearing is mandated by
20                                               AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


  Department of Defense policy and indicates only that a hearing may be held. It does not
  indicate release is imminent. Parole and/or clemency are not automatically awarded. If the
  hearing is held, the victim or witness will be advised prior to the inmate’s case appears
  before the service Clemency and Parole Board. This will provide the victim or witness with
  an opportunity, if so desired, to submit an impact statement for consideration by the board.
  The victim impact statement may be written or taped on either audio or videotape, see
  paragraph 10.8.6 All requests for notification from victims or witnesses remain confidential.
  Therefore, the VWAP monitor is the principal facility point of contact to report any
  complaint of inmate harassment or threat toward a victim and/or witness. The VWAP
  monitor reports all com plaints to the confinement officer for further investigation and
  possible disciplinary action. In virtually all reported cases of contact, the commanding officer
  normally directs the inmate to cease communications with the victim or witness.
     3.2.3.1. Service Clemency and Parole Board addresses: Army Clemency and Parole
     Board, 1941 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington VA 22202-4508; telephone (703) 607-
     1504/1903. Air Force Clemency and Parole Board (SAFPC), 1535 Command Drive, EE
     Wing, 3rd Floor, Andrews AFB MD 20762-7002; telephone (240) 857-5774; Naval
     Counsel of Personnel Boards, Building 36, Washington Naval Yard, Washington DC
     20374-5023.
     3.2.3.2. Canceling the Notification Request. A victim or witness may request removal
     from the VWAP notification program by writing the service central repository. Forward
     requests made directly to the confinement/corrections facility to the service central
     repository. The confinement/ corrections facility may recommend canceling a notification
     request to the service central repository when the victim or witness fails to respond within
     60 days to an inquiry (unsuccessful notification attempts) that concerns continued
     participation.
     3.2.3.3. Prior to canceling a notification request, document in the Victim and Witness
     Notification record all efforts to contact the victim or witness. After the two failed
     attempts (i.e., undeliverable certified mail and phone contact resulted in disconnected
     phone number) to contact the victim or witness, the VWAP monitor will notify the
     central repository in writing, indicating what actions were taken to locate the individual,
     recommending disenrollment. The Central Repository, HQ AFSFC/SFC, will in turn
     respond with a decision.
  3.2.4. Files. Annotate Correctional Treatment Files (CTF) of inmates included in the victim
  and witness program for local identification. For example: "VICTIM/WITNESS
  NOTIFICATION(S) REQUIRED" in 1‖ high labels and highlight the file ID label to
  immediately identify inmates with participants. In response to a Privacy Act request, victim
  or witness information is exempt from release under the PA, 5 U.S.C. Section 552a), the
  request may be denied pursuant to PA exemption (j) (2). If a request for information is made
  under the Freedom of Information Act the victim/witness information denied in accordance
  with FOIA exemptions 6 and 7(C). Do not allow the inmate access to VWAP information.
  The VWAP Monitor maintains a separate adjunct file containing each Victim/ Witness
  Notification record, filed under the inmate’s last name. Document all contacts with a victim
  or witness, including telephone calls on the DD Form 2705, Victim/Witness Notification of
  Inmate Status. Annotate the date, time, type of contact, telephone number/address used,
  staff name and reasons/outcome.

  3.2.5. Victim and Witness Records. VWAP monitors will add VWAP files to file
  maintenance and disposition plans. Establish facility VWAP files or binders and mark as
  victim/witness file ―DO NOT RELEASE TO INMATE‖ and ―Exempt from Freedom of
  Information Act and Privacy Act Release.‖ Maintain these files for all inmates assigned IAW
  AFMAN 37-139, table 31-2. For inmates transferring to another facility, create individual
  VWAP files by sealing the file in a separate envelope and mark Victim/Witness file ―DO
  NOT RELEASE TO INMATE‖ and ―Exempt from Freedom of Information Act and Privacy
  Act Release.‖ This file is hand carried by the escort to the gaining facility. If the inmate is
  approved for transfer to the AF Return-to-Duty Program, the losing facility will fax or mail
  the DD Form 2704 to the gaining facility.
  3.2.5. (AFMC) Victim and Witness Records. VWAP monitors will add VWAP files to file
  maintenance and disposition plans. Establish facility VWAP files or binders and mark as
  victim/witness file ―DO NOT RELEASE TO INMATE‖ and ―Exempt from Freedom of
  Information Act and Privacy Act Release.‖ Maintain these files for all inmates assigned IAW
  AFMAN 37-139, table 31-2. For inmates transferring to another facility, create individual
  VWAP files by sealing the file in a separate envelope and mark Victim/Witness file ―DO
  NOT RELEASE TO INMATE‖ and ―Exempt from Freedom of Information Act and Privacy
  Act Release.‖ This file is hand carried by the escort to the gaining facility. If the inmate is
  approved for transfer to the AF Return-to-Duty Program, the losing facility will fax or mail
  the DD Form 2704 to the gaining facility.
  3.2.6. Types of Notification and Time Frames. Use the DD Form 2705, Victim/Witness
  Notification of Inmate Status, to make victim and witness notifications. Use this form to
  advise victims and witnesses of any change in the inmate’s confinement status. Attach it to
  the appropriate cover sheet (Attachment 7, Attachment 8, or Attachment 9). Make
  notifications at least 45 days in advance to the specific action, unless otherwise prescribed.
  Annotate all notifications on the Victim/Witness Notification Record (Attachment 10), or
  similar document and file by the accused’s last name, with all other VWAP documents. Send
  all correspondence by certified mail, return receipt requested. Attach all certified registered
  return receipts to the facility copy of the DD Form 2705 and file in the facility VWAP
  monitors adjunct file. Provide the service Clemency & Parole Board (C&PB) a statement,
  IAW paragraph 10.6.14 indicating whether the notifications were made and whether or not
  victim/witness statements were submitted to the VWAP monitor.
     3.2.6.1. Initial Contact. Send the initial Victim/Witness Notification Cover Letter
     (Attachment 7) to victims and witnesses within 10 working days of receiving the DD

     3.2.6.3. Transfer. Notify victims and witnesses of inmate transfer to another facility
     (Attachment 8). Regardless of military service, forward victim and witness information
     via separate correspondence to the commander of the receiving facility. Requests for
     transfer to another confinement/ corrections facility must identify cases where victim and
     witness notification is required. The commander of the receiving facility notifies victims
     and witnesses of the inmate’s new location and enrollment in the facility’s victim and
     witness notification program within 14 days of inmate arrival. Send a copy of the
     notification to the appropriate service Central Repository, i.e., for AF inmates send to:
     HQ AFSFC/SFC, 1517 Billy Mitchell Boulevard, Lackland AFB, TX 78236-0119. For
     other service central repository addresses contact HQ AFSFC/SFC.
         3.2.6.3.1. If transferred to the USDB, forward the victim and witness information
         separately to the Command Judge Advocate, Attn: USDB VWAP Monitor, 1301 N.
         Warehouse Road, Fort Leavenworth, KS 66027-2304.
         3.2.6.3.2. Refer to the HQ AFSFC corrections division web page
         https://wwwmil.lackland.af.mil/afsf for a complete listing of Level 1 RCFs and
         higher. It can be located on the Lackland AFB web site under HQ AFSFC.
     3.2.6.4. Release. Notify victims and witnesses when an inmate is scheduled for release
     via DD Form 2705 and Attachment 8. Provide the date, method of release and
     destination (city and state). In parole cases, include the parole officer’s name and
     telephone number. Make notifications by telephone when the inmate is unexpectedly
     released or when required by short-notice time frames. NOTE: If a Military Magistrate
     determines a detainee should be released from pre-trial confinement, the detainee’s
     commander will be informed of the need to notify any potential victim or witness of the
     release.
     3.2.6.5. Escape. Notify victims and witnesses by telephone as soon as possible after
     discovery of an escape by an adjudged inmate. Victims and witnesses will be re-notified
     by telephone upon the inmate’s return to confinement. Provide this information to the
     service Central Repository, HQ AFSFC/SFC by the most expeditious means (fax, e-mail,
     or telephone). See 3.2.10 for procedures if a pre-trial detainee escapes. The telephone
     notification is followed up in writing via DD Form 2705 and Attachment 8.
     3.2.6.6. Emergency Parole (EP). Exhaust all reasonable efforts to notify victims and
     witnesses before the inmate’s release on EP. Victims/witnesses are normally notified by
     telephone due to a lack of time prior to release and followed up in writing, via DD Form
     2705 and Attachment 8. For EP requirements, see paragraph 10.23
     3.2.6.7. Death. Notify the victim or witness within 10 days of the death of an inmate via,
     DD Form 2705 and Attachment 8.
  3.2.7. Victim/Witness Protection. Any time a victim/witness is believed to be in danger,
  render all assistance possible (within jurisdictional limits) to get protection for them.
  Assistance may range from advising the victim/witness to contact local law enforcement, to
  the confinement officer or designee personally advising law enforcement agencies in the
  victim/witness’ jurisdiction of danger. Military authorities should handle protection for
  victims/witnesses within military jurisdiction. Notify Air Force Office of Special
  Investigations (AFOSI) in cases involving Air Force inmates. Advise inmates they are not to
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                             23


  make contact with any victim or witness of their confining offense either directly or through
  a third party without the permission of the victim or witness. This prohibition includes
  contact via telephone calls, visits, written letters, or e-mail. Inmates desiring to communicate
  with a victim or witness may submit a request to the confinement officer. The VWAP
  Monitor will contact the victim or witness to determine whether contact is desired. This
  requirement applies to all cases regardless of whether the victim or witness has elected to
  participate in this program.
  3.2.8. VWAP Training. All confinement/corrections personnel should periodically receive
  information about VWAP and staff responsibilities. Arrange training with the local SJA. All
  confinement officers, or delegated representative should become actively involved with the
  base victim witness assistance council.
  3.2.9. Report Control Symbol (RCS): HAF-SF (M) 9611, Victim/Witness Monthly Status
  Report. Each installation housing inmates in their facility (or housing inmates in a civilian
  facility off-base), must complete and send AF Form 4289, Monthly Victim/Witness Activity
  Report Concerning Inmate Status, to HQ AFSFC/SFC by the fifth of the following month.
  Negative reports (i.e., no one confined for the month) are required (form or letter format),
  with the confinement/corrections officer’s name and signature. Reports must be mailed to
  HQ AFSFC/SFC, 1517 Billy Mitchell Boulevard, Lackland AFB, TX 78236 or faxed to DSN
  945-5411.
     3.2.9.1. This activity report collects pertinent inmate data which HQ AFSFC uses to
     complete DD Form 2720, Annual Confinement Report and DD Form 2706, Annual
     Report on Victim and Witness Assistance for HQ AFLSA, OSD P & R and Department
     of Justice. Complete AF Form 4289 by listing all inmates/pre-trial detainees confined
     (on-base or off-base) during report period in Column’s I-VII. Inmates with VWAP
     notification requirements will be identified by completing Column’s VIII-XII. Indicate
     the number of days the inmate was confined on-base and/or off-base during the report
     month. If both locations are used, annotate the inclusive dates at each location in the
     remarks section after the inmate’s name. If the inmate has sex offender notification
     requirements, annotate accordingly. Entries pertaining to the number of victims are
     annotated in the (V) column, witnesses in the (W) column for the following: number
     informed of rights, number elected notification and number notified (DD Form 2705s
     sent) during the month. Annotate the numeric code to indicate how the notification was
     made (i.e., 1 for telephone or 2 for written) followed by the reason code(s) for the inmate
     status change(s) as defined in paragraph 3.2.6 Additionally, attach separate MFRs to
     include information regarding inability to contact a victim or witness in this report. IAW
     AFMAN 10-206, this report is designated emergency status code D. Immediately
     discontinue reporting data during emergency conditions.
  3.2.10. Pre-trial Detainees. The VWAP Monitor should immediately notify the detainee’s
  commander upon a change in the detainee’s status and directs them to make all appropriate
  victim or witness notifications regarding the change. Changes during pre-trial are not
  reflected on the monthly Victim Witness Status Report.
  3.2.11. Action. The confinement officer establishes internal controls to keep information
  submitted by victims and witnesses confidential and prevent unauthorized access to
  associated files. Include the Confinement VWAP in facility operating instructions.
 24                                               AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


3.3. Sex Offender Notification Program. Appropriate state authorities must be notified in all
cases involving the release from confinement of inmates convicted of sexually violent offenses
or convicted of sex offenses against victims who were minors (persons under the age of 16
years). Conviction of any of the offenses specified in Attachment 11 triggers this reporting
requirement. However, there are additional sex offenses that trigger the reporting requirement.
When in doubt on whether a particular offense must be reported, consult the installation SJA.
DD Form 2791, Notice of Release/ Acknowledgement of Convicted Sex Offender
Registration, is required when a member is convicted of an offense that triggers the sex offender
registration requirements, even when confinement is not part of the adjudged punishment or
sufficient pretrial or illegal pretrial confinement credit offsets the term of confinement imposed
at trial, IAW AFI 51-201. Once notified of the conviction by SJA, the facility shall notify the
appropriate agencies immediately, not to exceed 24 hours. Each facility sex offender
registration/notification program will be inspected, as a minimum, every three years. This can be
accomplished during MAJCOM/IG or SF Staff Assistance Visits using HQ AFSFC/SFC
provided criteria. Inspections will include, as a minimum, identification of all sex offenders
convicted of a criteria sex offense during the past 12 months. Conduct a review of the sex
offender notification files to verify each PS Form 3811, Domestic Return Receipt, was received
(i.e., stapled to or filed with the DD Form 2705) or verify the form was suspensed for 14 days
CONUS or 30 days for OCONUS to ensure the notification (DD Form 2791, Notice of
Release/Acknowledgement of Convicted Sex Offender Registration Requirements) is
received by the required agencies. The three notifications are: the State Attorney General, Local
Law Enforcement and the State Sex Offender Registration Official where the offender will reside
(Attachment 12 & Attachment 13). Each facility will ensure notifications are completed as
required by this instruction, DoD guidance and Federal Statutes. Attach a copy of AF Form
1359, Report of Result of Trial, to the DD Form 2791, prior to sending to the three agencies.
Also, ensure the facility sex offender program monitor files the original in the offenders Unit
Personnel Records Group (UPRG) maintained at the MPF and maintains a copy. Contact HQ
AFSFC/SFC for assistance with unusual situations or circumstances of convicted sex offenders
located OCONUS. Additionally, all sex offender requirements will be included in all facility
operating instructions and self-inspection checklists.
   3.3.1. Procedure. In cases where notification is required, the confinement/corrections staff
   where the offender is confined and regardless of the branch of service of which the offender
   is a member, shall:
       3.3.1.1. Inform the offender prior to final release that they will be subject to a
       registration requirement as a sex offender in any state or territory in which they reside,
       are employed, carry on a vocation, or are a student. NOTE: The offender will be
       informed immediately in cases where there was no confinement.
       3.3.1.2. Use the DD Form 2791, to obtain the offender’s written acknowledgment of the
       foregoing notification. Also obtain from the offender and include on the form the address
       at which they will reside upon release from confinement or upon completion of a court-
       martial resulting in a conviction of a triggering offense (Attachment 11). A
       confinement/corrections staff member will witness the offender’s signature on the form.
       If offender refuses to sign, contact the SJA for assistance, but as a minimum complete an
       MFR outlining the refusal and attach to the DD Form 2791.
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                          25


     3.3.1.3. File one copy of the released offender’s acknowledgment form in their CTF,
     another copy in the facility files and provide a third copy to the offender. Forward the
     original for placement in the offender’s Unit Personnel Records Group (UPRG).
        3.3.1.3.1. Inmates convicted of sex offenses must be notified of available community
        treatment programs prior to release. Inmates will be provided information on
        community treatment programs available in the community in which they will reside.
        This requirement applies whether or not the inmate participated in sex offender
        programs while incarcerated. Releasing inmates convicted of sex offenses poses a
        unique risk to the community at large. This is one reason why extensive sex offender
        treatment programs have been instituted at Level 2 and 3 correctional facilities. This
        notification is intended to supplement these programs and ensure that all inmates
        convicted of sex offenses are aware of local treatment opportunities before release,
        whether they were adjudged or sentenced for sex offense(s) against either a minor or
        an adult. EXCEPTION: Inmates transferred to another correctional facility or
        released to a detainer do not need to be provided this information at the losing
        confinement/corrections location.
        3.3.1.3.2. Prior to release, the confinement NCO will ensure all qualifying inmates
        receive the Notification of Community Treatment Programs (Attachment 14).
        Include the name, address and telephone number of the treatment agency. Other
        information may include the length and cost of treatment as well as the modality
        used. A minimum of one treatment source will be provided. The inmate will sign and
        date Attachment 14. Refusal to sign the form will be documented. A copy of the
        form will be filed in the inmate’s CTF. If released on parole, a copy will be forwarded
        to the parole officer. To determine what local resources are available, the following
        clearinghouses can be contacted for assistance in identifying sex offender treatment
        programs: Safer Society Foundation, P.O. Box 340, Brandon, VT 05733-0340, (802)
        247-5141 or Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers, 4900 SW Griffith
        Drive, Suite 274, Beaverton, OR 97005, (503) 643-1023. In addition to the above, the
        HQ AFSFC Det 2 Clinical Services may also be contacted for assistance in finding
        local resources.
     3.3.1.4. At least two weeks prior to the offender’s final release from confinement (to
     ensure receipt at least five days prior to the offender’s release date), complete and send
     separately addressed copies of DD Form 2791, via certified mail, return receipt
     requested. Suspense the return receipt request (PS Form 3811) for 14 days CONUS, or 30
     days for OCONUS to ensure notification. Once the receipt is returned, attach it to the DD
     Form 2791 and place in the facility adjunct file. Ensure all return receipts are returned.
     Document unreturned receipts, follow up and make reasonable attempts to locate the
     unreturned receipt. Contact HQ AFSFC/SFC for further instructions if all attempts fail.
     Notify the following agencies:
        3.3.1.4.1. State law enforcement where the offender will reside. This is the Attorney
        General for the state or territory. See Attachment 12.
        3.3.1.4.2. Local Law Enforcement. Local law enforcement where the offender will
        reside. Notify typically the chief of police of the municipality or the sheriff of the
        county where the offender plans to live. If assistance in identifying the appropriate
 26                                             AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


          agency is required in situations involving multiple jurisdictions with overlapping
          authority, consult the SJA.
          3.3.1.4.3. State Sex Offender Registration Official. This is the state or local agency
          responsible for maintenance of sex offender registration information for the state or
          territory in which the offender will reside upon release from confinement. NOTE:
          Accomplish the notification regardless whether the state requires this notice. See
          Attachment 13.
          3.3.1.4.4. In cases where the inmate is to be released on parole, provide the
          supervising US Probation Officer a copy of the inmate’s written acknowledgment and
          copies of the three DD Forms 2791 submitted in accordance with paragraph 3.3.1.4
          3.3.1.4.5. In cases where the convening authority in their action suspends a sentence
          to confinement adjudged by court-martial, the member’s release from confinement on
          suspension will trigger the above-described notice requirements and the confinement
          officer shall comply with the procedures detailed in paragraphs 3.3.1.1 -3.3.1.4.3 In
          the event the suspension is subsequently vacated and the member is required to serve
          his sentence to confinement, the notification requirements will be re-accomplished
          before the inmate is again released from confinement.
   3.3.2. The confinement officer may delegate the above victim/witness and sex offender
   release notification responsibilities to a subordinate officer or noncommissioned officer.
3.4. Compliance with DNA Collection under Federal Law. On 16 May 2001, DoD issued a
memorandum establishing DoD policy for implementing Section 5 of the DNA Analysis
Backlog Elimination Act of 2000, 10 U.S.C. § 1565. In accordance with this legislation and DoD
policy, DNA samples must be collected from each member of the armed forces who has been
convicted of a "Qualifying Military Offense" (Attachment 15), except for those members
currently in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons or on parole under supervision of a
federal probation office. The requirement (Attachment 16) to maintain a stock of kits is based
on a facility’s size of five or more beds (Attachment 17). All other CFs need to contact HQ
AFSFC/SFC for a kit. The collection will be obtained prior to the members placement on
appellate review leave or parole. Once complete, submit to USACIL as identified in paragraph
A16.1.2.7. Then fax or mail a copy of the collection kit card to HQ AFSFC/SFC.
3.5. Annual Confinement Report. A confinement officer responsible for housing inmates
sends this report, via DD Form 2720, to the appropriate MAJCOM/SF. The report covers the
periods from January to December. MAJCOM/SFs consolidate the reports into one report and
submit no later than 5 February, to HQ AFSFC/SFC, 1517 Billy Mitchell Boulevard, Lackland
AFB, TX 78236-0119 (DSN fax: 945-5411). MAJCOMS will include copies of the individual
installation reports. Assign Report Control Symbol (RCS): DD-P&R (A) 2067 to the Annual
Confinement Report. This report is designated emergency status code D. Immediately
discontinue reporting data requirements during emergency conditions.
   3.5.1. (Added-AFMC) The confinement officer will send the Annual Confinement Report,
   via DD Form 2720, Annual Confinement Report (electronically) to HQ AFMC/A7SO, NLT
   10 January or as directed by MAJCOM.
3.6. Requests for Deviation from Security Criteria. Use AF Form 116, Request for
Deviation from Security Criteria for instances relating to physical security deficiencies only.
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                             27

                                 FACILITY MANAGEMENT

4.1. Establishing, Changing Designation and Closing Level 1 CFs and RCFs. Installation
commanders must maintain the capability to house pre-trial detainees and post-trial inmates as
outlined in 1.3.9 Installation commanders without a correctional facility are encouraged to
establish an organic capability on their installation but must seek guidance from HQ
AFSFC/SFC prior to establishing capability.
   4.1.1. Installations having an organic correctional facility may not close that facility without
   MAJCOM coordination and HQ AFSFC/CC. HQ AFSFC will, in turn, coordinate approval
   IAW DoDD 1325.4. Normally, approval to close an existing facility will not be given, except
   in situations involving safety, security, health and well being of inmates/staff, or emergency
   conditions. At a minimum, the proposal should be staffed for comment at least 60 days
   before final approval is desired.
   4.1.2. Changes in status or alterations/renovations of an existing facility must be coordinated
   with MAJCOM and HQ AFSFC/SFC to enable planning while the facility is unable to house
   inmates. HQ AFSFC/SFC, with MAJCOM coordination, determines designation of a facility
   as a Regional Correctional Facility (RCF), based on overall needs of the Air Force and DoD
   correctional systems. Send information copies of changes to HQ AFSFC/SFC, 1517 Billy
   Mitchell Boulevard, Lackland AFB, TX 78236-0119.
       4.1.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Changes in status or alterations/renovations of an existing
       facility must be coordinated with HQ AFMC/A7SO if the facility is unable to house
       inmates.
4.2. Level 1 CF and RCF Requirements. The facility requirements for CFs and RCFs include
areas for administration, housing of inmates, training, recreation and the means for making the
facility secure against escape.
   4.2.1. New construction or modification of existing structures for incarceration purposes will
   be based on designs approved by the Chief of Civil Engineers IAW applicable federal
   building codes for penal institutions.
   4.2.2. AFCS facilities should be located away from (as determined by the CSF) installation
   perimeter fences, childcare facilities/schools, public thoroughfares, gates, swimming pools,
   base exchanges, theaters, family housing, airman billets, service clubs, open messes, foliage
   or wooded areas, active flight lines or firing ranges.
4.3. Level 1 CF and RCF Standards. The term Level 1 includes CFs and RCFs. Reference
paragraph 3.6 for submitting deviations (waivers, variances and exceptions). The confinement
officer ensures space is available for inmate housing, recreation, administration and education.
The facility design must include escape prevention as well as safety and emergency evacuation
procedures. A CF and RCF must have as a minimum: hot/cold running water, HVAC, lighting
and toilet within the secured perimeter to operate (each standard is specified in paragraphs 4.3.1
through 4.7.6 A CF and RCF shall also provide the following capabilities:
   4.3.1. Segregation cells (Administrative/Disciplinary) located so physical contact with non-
   segregated and other segregated inmates is impossible and to minimize the possibility of
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                              29


   escape and self inflicted injury. The following minimum standards for buildings used to
   house inmates are as follows:
       4.3.1.1. For all CFs and RCFs built prior to 1 Jan 97, the space allotment for dormitory
       type facilities will be designed on the basis of 72 square feet per inmate (except under
       circumstances described in 4.3.1.2 below), computed on a net room area that includes
       open aisle but excludes latrines, closed corridors and utility space.
       4.3.1.2. When conditions prevent the use of standard allocation during temporary periods
       of increased inmate population, provide 50 square feet per inmate. MAJCOM/SF
       commanders may approve operations under the reduced space allocation rule for up to 60
       days. Only HQ AFSFC/ SFC may approve emergency minimum space allocation for any
       period beyond 60 days.
       4.3.1.3. Space allotment for individual cells or rooms and for cells that are used for
       segregation of inmates will be: 8 feet long, 6 feet wide and 8 feet high (minimum inside
       measurements). When any cell or room does not meet this minimum space requirement, a
       medical doctor or physician’s assistant must inspect and certify it as acceptable for
       confinement. The facility must obtain a waiver (via memorandum) from the installation
       commander. Do not use AF Form 116, in this instance.
       4.3.1.4. As of 1 Jan 97, all new construction and/or renovation of existing facilities will
       provide each inmate 60 square feet in individual cells and open bays with 35 square feet
       of space unencumbered by furnishings or fixtures. Ensure ceiling to floor distance is at
       least 8 feet.
       4.3.1.5. When confinement exceeds 10 hours per day, provide at least 80 square feet of
       total floor space per occupant. NOTE: Does not include normal sleep time.
       4.3.1.6. Ensure dayrooms and recreation rooms provide a minimum of 35 square feet per
       inmate allowed to use the room at one time. No day room or recreation room will contain
       less than 100 square feet.
   4.3.2. Division of inmates by status (Pre-trial/Post-trial), custody grade, sex and officer or
   enlisted.
   4.3.3. Provisions for reasonable comfort consistent with good order and discipline.
   4.3.4. Administrative areas separate from security functions.

   4.3.9. Dayrooms with space for reading, writing and table games at RCF’s. Level 1 CFs can
   fulfill this requirement by having access to a room/area outside the cell or use of installation
   library when custody/escort requirements are met.
4.4. Security, Safety, Fire Prevention and Comfort Measures. The confinement officer
determines the level of monthly inspections through written policy and procedure, for facility
 30                                               AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


compliance with security, safety and fire prevention standards. NOTE: Local or State fire codes
must be strictly adhered to in order to ensure the safety and well being of inmates and staff. In
the event local and/or state codes are not applicable, the requirements of the National Fire
Protection Association Life Safety Code will apply. The following guidelines will be established:
   4.4.1. Physical Barriers. Control public entry into inmate areas and to prevent inmate escape.
   Facility boundary fences for stand-alone facilities must be, as a minimum, 7-foot-high, 9-
   guage steel wire, chain-link fence fabric, with 3-strand barbed wire mounted on an inward
   45-degree angle. Secure fence fabric at the bottom. Ensure gates are wide enough to permit
   entry for all emergency vehicles.
       4.4.1.1. The confinement officer develops a written policy for a monthly inspection by a
       qualified fire and safety officer to determine facility compliance. Additionally, the
       confinement officer will annually review policies and procedures with the qualified
       inspector.
       4.4.1.2. The confinement NCO (or a confinement/corrections staff member) will trained
       to conduct weekly security, safety, fire prevention and sanitation inspections. At a
       minimum, use on-the-job training from applicable qualified sources (i.e., base personnel,
       instructions or regulations and checklists).
       4.4.1.3. Weekly security inspections will include checking all bars, locks, windows,
       walls, floors, vent covers, glass panels, access plates, protective screens, doors, devices
       and other areas within the secured environment to ensure they are fully operational (list
       can be tailored to local needs). Emergency keys should be checked quarterly to ensure
       they are in working order. All defective security equipment will be replaced or repaired
       immediately.
   4.4.2. Augmented Security. When possible, use Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) for
   internal and external control.
       4.4.2.1. Ensure CCTV does not clearly invade inmate privacy unless suicidal or violent
       behavior dictates otherwise.
       4.4.2.2. Do not have members of the opposite sex monitor inmate latrine and shower
       areas.
       4.4.2.3. Keep CCTV monitors from public view.

   bays. Do not secure cells with padlocks. Keep all keys in a secure location and establish
   procedures to issue, receive and inventory keys.
       4.4.3.1. Duplicate keys must be immediately available for emergencies and covered in
       emergency plans. Ensure key sets are regularly rotated to ensure they function properly.
       4.4.3.2. Electronic locks must have a manual backup. Monitor control panels on a 24-
       hour basis. Ensure panels contain a "group release" for cell or room doors.
   4.4.4. Comfort measures.
       4.4.4.1. Interior and exterior lighting. When feasible, light each cell and facility through
       windows or skylights large enough to emit natural light (facilities built after 1 Jan 97
       should have windows or skylights installed) with one or the other.
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                             31


          4.4.4.1.1. Artificial light in rooms, cells and personal hygiene areas is at least 20
          foot-candles at desktop level. Annual surveys are conducted and documented by Bio-
          environmental flight or in some locations, CE.
          4.4.4.1.2. When feasible provide all individuals confined in cells or rooms with a
          view to the outside of at least three square feet.
          4.4.4.1.3. Provide adequate exterior lighting for security and safety.
          4.4.4.1.4. Install wire mesh covering or safety glass for lighting fixtures in areas

   4.5.4. Do not divide visiting areas by any type of barrier.
   4.5.5. Do not use "black-out" cells.
   4.5.6. Do not guard inmates with canine teams. Patrol dogs may be used to assist in the
   search of escaped inmates. Detector dogs may be used to conduct facility contraband checks.
   4.5.7. Do not use chemicals other than riot control agents.
   4.5.8. Do not use firearms to guard pre-trial detainees and post-trial inmates, except under
   escort.
   4.5.9. Do not use restraining devices, such as leg irons, during inmate employment to create
   a ―chain gang‖.
   4.5.10. Do not secure (restrain) inmates to fixed objects, except in emergencies, or when
   specifically approved by the confinement officer, to prevent potential danger to corrections
   personnel or the community.
4.6. Furnishings. Confinement officers ensure each cell or area has at least one sleeping
surface. The surface consists of a mattress at least 12 inches off the floor (per inmate); a writing
surface and proximate area to sit (required only if inmate is inside more than 10 hours per day);
storage space for personal items; and place to suspend clothes. Provide sufficient furnishings,
consistent with inmate custody levels, in day rooms for every occupant using it at one time.
4.7. Equipment. Confinement officers ensure CFs and RCFs provide the following:
   4.7.1. Office equipment to support the administrative function.
   4.7.2. Janitorial supplies for use in the facility and serviceable tools for inmate work

4.8. Holding and Detention Cells. A Holding Cell is a temporary detention cell which holds an
individual up to 8-hours (maximum). A Detention Cell holds an individual up to 72-hours
(maximum). Normally, these facilities support law enforcement operations. These facilities are
only used, after careful evaluation, as a temporary location for pre-trial detainees or post-trial
inmates until transferred to an acceptable confinement/corrections facility location. Reference
DoD Mil-HDBK-1037/4. NOTE: Pre-trial detainees/post-trial inmates will not be co-mingled
with individuals detained for law enforcement processing (i.e., DUI suspect, etc.). Specific
holding/detention cell standards are prescribed locally or by the respective MAJCOM.

                        ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT

5.1. Inmate Status. An individual awaiting the filing of charges, disposition of charges, trial by
courts-martial or trial by foreign court is a pre-trial detainee. Subsequent to the sentence being
announced in open court, but not approved by the convening authority, the inmate's status is
adjudged (post-trial). An inmate becomes sentenced when the convening authority (CA) takes
action to execute the sentence.
   5.1.1. Pre-trial. Complete AF Form 444, Advisement of Rights Upon Pre-trial
   Confinement and DD Form 2707, Confinement Order for each pre-trial detainee. The unit
   representative affecting the confinement completes the AF Form 444 and is witnessed by a
   confinement/corrections staff member, IAW Rules for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 304 and 305.
   5.1.2. Post-trial. Ensure completion of the DD Form 2707, Confinement Order for each
   post-trial inmate. An authorized commissioned, warrant, or noncommissioned officer may
   sign the DD Form 2707, authorizing confinement. (See Articles 9(b) and 11(a) of the UCMJ
   and MCM, R.C.M. 1101.) The AF Form 1359, Report of Result of Trial, may serve in lieu
   of the DD Form 2707, if the accused was in continuous pre-trial confinement from the
   confinement date to the adjudged date.
   5.1.3. Civilians and military personnel can be detained in AFCS facilities pending their
   release to competent authorities. The detention must meet any local, host tenant or Status of
   Forces Agreements. The detainment of any member not subject to the UCMJ requires
   coordination with SJA.
       5.1.3.1. Inmates of other services of the United States (Army, Navy, Marines, Coast
       Guard) will be incarcerated in AFCS facilities, per DoD directives and other appropriate
       inter-service support agreements.
       5.1.3.2. Inmates of other services incarcerated in AFCS facilities will be subject to the
       policies contained in this instruction, except as directed by HQ AFSFC/SFC.
   5.1.4. The installation SJA will supervise the administration of military justice and ensure
   appropriate legal assistance is provided for inmates. Inmates will be afforded access to their
   attorney, usually the ADC, concerning the status of their case, sentence and other pending
   legal matters.
   5.1.5. The installation SJA will serve as legal advisor to the confinement officer/NCOIC and
   staff. The SJA will also assist in providing legal materials necessary to support inmate needs
   for access to legal libraries.
5.2. Determining the Place of Confinement. All Air Force detainees/inmates serve sentences
within the Air Force or DoD corrections system according to policies set forth in this instruction.
   5.2.1. Pre-Trial Detainees: Under normal situations, pre-trial detainees will be detained
   locally. Pre-trial detainees are confined IAW Rules for Courts-Martial, 304-308 and Article
   13, UCMJ. Pre-trial detainees are confined if they specifically meet the criteria outlined in
   R.C.M., Rule 305 (h) (2) (B). For housing and uniform requirements, refer to paragraphs 5.8
 34                                              AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


   and 7.1 HQ AFSFC/SFC approves deviations from local place of confinement criteria and
   directs detainee transfers as appropriate.
   5.2.2. Post Trial Inmates (Male) with Adjudged Sentence over Seven Years or Death: Male
   inmates (officer, enlisted or cadet) under sentence of death or with a sentence of more than
   seven years, will serve their sentences at the USDB, Ft Leavenworth, KS, or as determined
   by the Director, Air Force Corrections (sentences must be at least seven years and one day
   upon arrival at the USDB). Requests for housing inmates in other Army
   confinement/corrections facilities require HQ AFSFC/SFC to coordinate and obtain approval
   from HQ Army (DAPM-MPD-CI) 48-hours prior to transfer. NOTE: Refer to terms in
   Attachment 1 for facility levels.
   5.2.3. Post Trial Inmates (Male) with Adjudged Sentence Less than Seven Years: Male
   inmates (officer, enlisted or cadet) with sentences of more than 15 months but less than seven
   years will serve their sentences at any Level 2 Facility or as determined by the Director, Air
   Force Corrections. Male inmates (officer, enlisted or cadet) with sentences of more than 180
   days but less than 15 months may serve their sentence at Level 1 RCFs or as determined by
   the Director, Air Force Corrections. Male inmates (officer, enlisted or cadet) with approved
   sentences of less than 180 days may serve their sentence at Level 1 CFs or as determined by
   the Director, Air Force Corrections.
   5.2.4. Post Trial Inmates (Female): Female inmates (officer, enlisted or cadet) under
   sentence of death or with an sentence of more than 15 months will serve their sentences at
   the Naval Consolidated Brig Miramar, CA, or as determined by the Director, Air Force
   Corrections. Female inmates (officer, enlisted or cadet) with sentences of more than 180 days
   but less than 15 months may serve their sentence at Level 1 RCFs or as determined by the
   Director, Air Force Corrections. Female inmates (officer, enlisted or cadet) with sentences of
   less than 180 days may serve their sentence at Level 1 CFs or as determined by the Director,
   Air Force Corrections.
   5.2.5. In rare circumstances, detainees/inmates in previously high-profile positions (e.g.,
   senior leadership) in pre-trial or post-trial status may present a unique housing problem. The
   CSF should coordinate with Director, Air Force Corrections for guidance.
5.3. Processing Inmates into a Facility. The confinement officer ensures all
confinement/corrections staff members are proficient in-processing new inmates. Processing
includes at least one briefing on facility rules and an interview by the confinement officer or
NCOIC. Provide a rulebook to the detainee/ inmate which contain facility rules and formal
complaint process. In-processing includes the following: completing DD Form 2711, Initial
Custody Classification, issuing health and comfort items (if applicable) and conducting a
National Crime Information Center (NCIC)/National Law Enforcement Telecommunications
System (NLETS) inquiry. CONUS inquires are mandatory through established agreements with
civil law enforcement. OCONUS will coordinate the inquiry with HQ AFSFC. With SJA
assistance, this inquiry needs to screen for prior sex offender criteria offenses (civilian or
military) and needs to encompass applicable files or sources, i.e., Computerized Criminal History
(CCH). If the inmate was previously convicted as a sex offender, obtain the names and addresses
of any victims or witnesses from the appropriate agency (to contact them of the re-confinement).
If the inmate was convicted and confined as an AF member, locate the confining installation for
the DD Form 2704, for VWAP notifications (if applicable) and DD Form 2791 for sex offender
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                              35


notifications upon re-confinement. If the inmate was previously convicted as a sex offender
without confinement, locate the appropriate notification documents (i.e., DD Form 2791, if
military convicted). Notify the appropriate agencies of the re-confinement. See paragraphs 3.2
and 3.3 for VWAP and sex offender notification requirements.
   5.3.1. The inmate will maintain a copy of the facility rulebook until departure. The inmate
   must sign a statement acknowledging that they understand the rules. The rulebook should
   contain all appropriate inmate activities, making anything not listed as prohibited or
   unauthorized. This is particularly effective in contraband control, since the staff confiscates
   unauthorized articles and takes appropriate action. Rules should be kept to a minimum and be
   positive in nature. The rulebook will also include the formal complaint process specified in
   paragraphs 6.3.3 -6.3.4.2, confinement/corrections facility offenses (Attachment 5) and
   discipline and control measures specified in paragraph 8.8 In-processing also includes
   accomplishing the following: photographing and fingerprinting, search of the inmate’s
   property, receipt for property and a complete search of the inmate. Ensure an appropriate
   gender witness is present while conducting a complete search. Annotate all findings such as
   scars, marks and tattoos. In conducting the search, inmates shall not be searched by members
   of the opposite sex, except in emergency situations. When no female staff members are
   available and no emergency exists, seek assistance from hospital personnel or the
   detainee/inmate's unit. NOTE: If during the initial interview, the interviewer determines an
   inmate needs immediate medical or behavioral health care, contact the medical or mental
   (behavioral) health clinic for assistance.
   5.3.2. Initial Confinement Examination. This determination will be a physical examination
   by a medical officer. The examining official shall certify the person’s fitness for confinement
   on the confinement order within 24 hours after entry into confinement or next duty day for
   processing on weekends or holidays. Fitness for confinement is not synonymous with fitness
   for arduous duty. However, the examining official should specify physical limitations to full
   duty performance in writing. This examination, at a minimum, includes a medical and
   behavioral health records review and physical examination.
       5.3.2.1. The examining official will use DD Form 2707, Confinement Order, or locally
       generated form and will annotate the presence of cuts, bruises, or unusual marks.
       Additionally, the medical officer will test for communicable diseases, including HIV,
       Tuberculosis (TB) and Hepatitis B and conduct urinalysis screening for illegal drug and
       narcotic use. The medical officer will also inspect all body cavities to prevent the
       introduction of contraband into the facility. The DD Form 2707, will be filed in the CTF
       with all of the documented results, except HIV results, which is annotated in the medical
       treatment file and discussed between the examining official and confinement/corrections
       NCO. Female inmates will also be administered a pregnancy test, with results annotated
       on the confinement order and in the medical treatment record.
       5.3.2.2. If the inmate displays irrational or inappropriate behavior which is symptomatic
       of mental disturbance, consult the behavioral health officer immediately for disposition.
       If the inmate displays the effects of hallucinatory substance, the inmate shall be placed in
       a medical facility and not be certified as fit for confinement until such time as they are
       capable or participating in their legal defense. NOTE: The medical staff documents HIV
       test results in the inmate’s medical records.

     5.3.2.3. Urinalysis testing is conducted as an inspection for contraband, pursuant to MRE
     313(b). Testing is conducted under the AF Drug Testing Program, category MO (medical
     drug test), IAW AFI 44-120, Drug Abuse Testing Program.
     5.3.2.4. DNA samples must be collected from each member of the armed forces who has
     been convicted of a "Qualifying Military Offense" as listed in Attachment 15. The DNA
     sample will be collected in accordance with Attachment 16, paragraph A16.1.2.2.
     5.3.2.5. The designated mental (behavioral) health officer shall screen the inmate’s
     medical records for behavioral health consultation entries within 72-hours of the inmate’s
     confinement entry to include off-base facilities. Determine if the inmate requires follow-
     on behavioral health support or is a danger to self or others.
  5.3.3. When possible, segregate new inmates from others during initial processing and

     in paragraph 3.7 Upon recapture, complete another set of FBI Form I-12. For both
     situations, forward one form to the FBI CJIS Division; file the other in the CTF.
     5.3.4.3. If an inmate with a FD-249 on file dies, immediately notify the FBI CJIS
     Division of the death by letter. Include postmortem fingerprints for humanitarian
     purposes only.
     5.3.4.4. Order FBI forms from the FBI, Criminal Justice Information Services Division
     (CJIS), Attn: LSU, 1000 Custer Hollow Road, Clarksburg, WV 26306 or (304) 625-3983;
     for questions or training materials call (304) 625-2000.
  5.3.5. Complete DD Form 2710, Inmate Background Summary.
  5.3.6. Complete DD Form 2715, Clemency/Parole Submission. Inmates may consult their
  area defense counsel or attorney prior to completing their request.
  5.3.7. Use DD Form 2715-2, Inmate Summary Data, to record changes in inmate status:
  progress during confinement, psychiatric or mental (behavioral) health evaluations and
  parole officer recommendations.
  5.3.8. Use DD Form 2719, Continuation Sheet, to continue information from DD Forms
  2710-1, 2715, 2715-2 and DD Form 2715-1, Disposition Board Recommendation.

AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                                 37


   blotter entries would include inmate incident information such as, date, time of incident and
   action taken.
   5.3.10. The confinement/corrections staff ensures the installation commander is informed
   within 24 hours of an inmate’s entry into confinement, IAW local instructions.
   5.3.11. Place all victim and witness notification information and request letters you receive
   from the judge advocate’s office in the CTF. NOTE: Make all letters available for review by
   disposition board members.
   5.3.12. The parent unit completes an AF Form 2098, Duty Status Change, to update the
   inmate’s duty status code and processes the form through the local Military Personnel Flight
   (MPF) and Financial Services Office (FSO).
   5.3.13. Inmates with dependents apply for household goods relocation according to AFI 36-
   3020, Family Member Travel and the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR) paragraph
   U5370-J.
5.4. Confinement. The confinement/corrections staff will use DD Form 506, Daily Strength
Record of Prisoners, to report entries into confinement when there are changes in custody,
status change, releases, gains, losses, transfers and death. A new report is not necessary if there is
no change from day to day. Accomplish a new report only when changes occur. DD Form 515,
Roster of Prisoners, supplements DD Form 506.
   5.4.1. Confinement of Pregnant Inmates. Confinement officers and NCOICs will consult
   medical personnel for the care and management of confined pregnant inmates. Pregnancy
   does not preclude confinement as long as appropriate prenatal care is provided and there is a
   medical treatment facility near the confinement/corrections facility, which can provide for
   labor, delivery and management of obstetric emergencies.
       5.4.1.1. Arrangement for placement for any child born while the mother is in custody
       must be made as soon as possible after the pregnancy is known, but no later than the
       seventh month of pregnancy. It is the responsibility of the expecting mother to decide
       what care arrangements will be made for the child. Alternatives include placing the child
       with relatives, in a foster home or for adoption. Corrections personnel will assist the
       mother in making arrangements with legal and family support services. Infants must be
       moved to the location of placement directly from the hospital. If the mother refuses or is
       unable to make arrangements the CSF will coordinate with SJA and civil authorities for
       temporary foster care. The person designated to provide temporary care must come to the
       hospital to receive the child.
       5.4.1.2. Following an uncomplicated delivery, the normal period of reduced activity is
       six weeks. The examining medical officer will determine reduced activities.
       5.4.1.3. All non-medical care expenses involved will be borne by the inmate.
       5.4.1.4. If the pregnancy of an inmate presents special or unique situations, it should be
       noted that the inmate may request deferment of the sentence to confinement in
       accordance with R.C.M. 1101(c).
   5.4.2. An inmate considering elective abortion will be permitted to discuss the matter with a
   medical officer or nurse practitioner and, if desired, with a chaplain or other counselor. Other
 38                                               AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


   than offering the services of a counselor, medical officer or a chaplain, facility personnel will
   not attempt to influence the inmate’s desires regarding abortion.
       5.4.2.1. 10 U.S.C. § 1093 prohibits the use of appropriated funds to perform abortions
       except when the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried full
       term. Consult medical personnel for further guidance.
       5.4.2.2. If an inmate desires to seek an abortion, she must submit a written request to the
       confinement officer. Except in instances where the life of the inmate would be
       endangered if the fetus were carried full term, the abortion must be funded by the inmate
       and, unless available in a military treatment facility, be arranged through a civilian
       facility. If assistance is needed, the confinement officer may only authorize transportation
       and security for visits to the location the abortion is to be performed and any subsequent
       follow-up care. Following an abortion at a civilian medical facility, the inmate will be
       examined by a military or government employed contract physician to determine the need
       for additional treatment and follow-up care.
          5.4.2.2.1. Following an abortion, a period of reduced activity is normal. For an
          uncomplicated abortion, the period of reduced activity would be approximately 72
          hours.
          5.4.2.2.2. The attending physician will make the final determination regarding the
          necessary length of hospitalization.
          5.4.2.2.3. Postoperative counseling is to be made available, if desired.
5.5. Correctional Treatment File (CTF). The corrections staff establishes a CTF for each
inmate during initial in processing, refer to Attachment 2. The confinement officer is
responsible for proper disposition of the CTF as follows:
   5.5.1. When AF inmates complete confinement sentences at Level 1 CF or RCF and are
   returned to their unit of assignment, the CTF will remain at the facility. The facility is
   responsible for the disposition of the CTF, IAW AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition
   Schedule. Inmates are not allowed access to VWAP or CTF files since these files are FOIA
   and PA exempt. The CTF of inmates with participants in the VWAP will be identified (i.e.,
   ―HAS VWAP PARTICIPANTS‖, or another appropriate annotation). Place VWAP forms in
   a separate file/binder and clearly mark it ―CONTAINS VICTIM OR WITNESS
   INFORMATION‖ and ―Do Not Release to Inmate.‖ Place it in a separate, secured file
   location with restricted access (i.e., VWAP Monitor, Confinement Officer etc.). Also,
   safeguard and apply appropriate restrictions on access to inmate medical treatment files.
   5.5.2. When temporarily transferred to another facility, transfer the CTF and medical record
   with the inmate’s escort. The CTF returns when the inmate returns to the base of assignment.
   Do not allow the inmate access to the CTF.
   5.5.3. When a detainee/inmate transfers, the CTF and medical record go with the inmate.
   The losing facility keeps copies of documents closing the Personal Deposit Fund (PDF), a
   copy of the transmittal letter listing all transferred items (including the CTF) and a copy of
   the DD Form 2708, Receipt for Inmate or Detained Person.
5.6. Status and Custody Grades. Upon initial confinement, the confinement officer or NCOIC
may convene a panel to determine the inmate's custody grade or may personally determine the
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                              39


inmate custody grade. The confinement officer or NCOIC classifies inmates as pre-trial, post-
trial or casual (inmates in transient or awaiting pick up or transportation) and assigns one of the
following custody grades to all inmates. (Attachment 3)
   5.6.1. Custody Grade Factors. The confinement officer or NCOIC should consider many
   factors when determining an inmate’s custody grade. These factors may include indications
   of emotional instability or disturbance, irresponsibility, prior escapes, Absent Without Leave
   (AWOL), maturity, degree and severity of offense and charges still pending. You may also
   consider an inmate’s history of emotional stability, violence and demonstrated sense of
   productive work. DD Form 2710, Inmate Background Summary may also contain
   information for determining the most appropriate custody grade.
   5.6.2. Changing Custody Grades. Corrections staff members should always pay close
   attention to an inmate’s conduct, mental state and work outlet performance. Subtle or
   pronounced changes in an inmate’s behavior may warrant changing the inmate’s custody
   grade. The corrections staff should annotate any such behavioral observations in the inmate’s
   record so the confinement officer can monitor and make custody grade decisions. Custody
   grades include trustee, minimum, medium and maximum security classifications. Facility
   commanders may subdivide these custody grades to facilitate additional security controls.
   5.6.3. Maximum Custody. Pose a serious threat to themselves or others, are an extreme
   escape risk, or whose behavior is seriously disruptive to the operation of the facility. Do not
   remove from the facility except in emergencies or unusual circumstances.
   5.6.4. Medium Custody. Medium custody inmates can be classified into two categories.
   Medium-In and Medium-out.
       5.6.4.1. Medium-In requires continual supervision. The inmate poses an escape risk, but
       does not present a significant threat to others or property. Assign this custody grade to
       inmates who demonstrate a poor adjustment to confinement. Do not assign medium-in
       custody inmates to work details away from the facility.
       5.6.4.2. Medium-Out Custody poses a minimal escape risk. Assign medium-out inmates
       work details inside or outside the facility under escort.
   5.6.5. Minimum Custody. Does not present an apparent threat of escape or danger. Assign
   minimum custody inmates work details inside or outside the facility. Parent unit personnel
   escort minimum custody inmates using the ratio of one escort per five inmates. When
   security forces personnel escort, the ratio is one per ten.
   5.6.6. Trustee (Community) Custody. Demonstrates a keen sense of responsibility and trust
   and requires very little supervision. This custody grade is reserved for inmates receiving
   long-term sentences who have demonstrated years of exceptional conduct and behavior
   throughout their incarceration. The AFCS does not use this custody grade in Level 1 CFs or
   RCFs.
5.7. Sentence Computation. The accurate computation of inmate sentences ensures proper
administration. It is also an essential element in protecting inmate legal rights. The confinement
officer or designated corrections staff member computes sentence and Good Conduct Time
(GCT) according to DoDI 1325.7, Administration of Military Correctional Facilities and
Clemency and Parole Authority and AFJI 31-215, Military Sentences to Confinement. The DD
 40                                              AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


Form 2710-1, Inmate Sentence Information, or a computer-generated equivalent shall be used
to compute sentences.
   5.7.1. The adjudged court-martial date will mark the Confinement Start Date (CSD) of the
   sentence to confinement. If an inmate served pre-trial confinement for the offense(s) for
   which the sentence was imposed, the CSD will be administratively adjusted to reflect the
   time spent in pre-trial confinement and any additional pre-trial confinement credit ordered by
   the military judge, convening authority, or appellate court. As a minimum, the following
   computation dates will be determined: maximum release date, minimum release date. For
   inmates with sentences over one-year, determine the disposition board due date and parole
   and clemency eligibility date (Attachment 18). The confinement officer or NCO assist
   eligible inmates in preparing the disposition board case file, unless specifically waived or
   postponed by the inmate in writing.
      5.7.1.1. Credit an inmate, at the beginning of the sentence, with the monthly GCT
      deduction for the full term of sentence. Also, credit the inmate any confinement time
      credit awarded by the court as stipulated on the Report of Result of Trial. This establishes
      the inmate’s MRD.
      5.7.1.2. Good Conduct Time (GCT) shall be accorded each inmate serving a sentence
      imposed by a court-martial or other military tribunal for a definite term or terms of
      confinement. It shall not be given to inmates who have life sentence. GCT shall be
      credited monthly with a deduction from the term of sentence(s) beginning with the day
      the sentence begins. GCT shall be credited at the rates described below:
          5.7.1.2.1. Five days for each month of the sentence, if the sentence is less than one
          year. For sentences over one year, refer to DoDI 1325.7., E26.1.1.
          5.7.1.2.2. Extra Good Conduct Time (EGCT). Confinement officers are authorized to
          grant EGCT as an additional incentive to reward good performance in work projects,
          education, behavioral health programs, or other activities deemed appropriate.
          Evaluations are used to award EGCT. Note: EGCT is synonymous with Earned Time
          (ET) Abatement prescribed in DoDI 1325.7. Those inmates enrolled in ECGT
          programs who receive unfavorable evaluations due to disciplinary reasons will not be
          awarded abatement. The following applies:
              5.7.1.2.2.1. Inmates must earn EGCT. The confinement officer does not grant it
              just because an inmate meets minimum expectations.
              5.7.1.2.2.2. Complete all EGCT projections at least 30 days prior to release.
              5.7.1.2.2.3. Compute the maximum allowable EGCT, IAW DoDI 1325.7, at three
              days per month for the first year and five days per month for subsequent years.
              Adjust an inmate’s MRD (factoring in granted or forfeited EGCT) monthly.
              5.7.1.2.2.4. The confinement officer provides a copy (fax/mail) of the DD Form
              2710-1 Inmate Sentence Information, or computer generated equivalent to HQ
              AFSFC/SFC for inmates earning EGCT.
          5.7.1.2.3. If a release falls upon a weekend, or a federal holiday, the inmates may be
          released on the preceding duty day, per AFJI 31-215, paragraph 4(g).
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                            41


   5.7.2. Inmates will have their sentence read by the confinement officer or a designated
   representative when the court-martial order promulgating the sentence is received and when a
   court-martial order remits or suspends a sentence or vacates a suspended sentence. The
   inmate will acknowledge that the court-martial order was read by signing a statement entered
   on the order containing the date of acknowledgement and the name and grade of the person
   that read the order. The signed order will be placed in the inmate's CTF. If an inmate refuses
   to sign, the confinement officer, or a designated representative will annotate accordingly.
   Any supplemental orders, suspensions of confinement, or final orders received by the facility
   after the inmate is placed on excess leave will be mailed, return receipt requested, to the
   member's leave address.
5.8. Quarters Assignment. The corrections staff assigns inmate quarters based on status, rank,
sex and custody grade. AFCS facilities use administrative segregation, disciplinary segregation,
special quarters and procedures for inmates under sentence of death.
   5.8.1. Administrative Segregation. Place inmates in administrative segregation as a
   minimum for the first 24 hours (up to a maximum of 72 hours) upon arrival into the facility.
   In all cases, administrative segregation is used for protective custody, medical reasons or
   prevention of injury while awaiting final disposition or during a pending investigation.
   Advise the inmate of the purpose. The corrections staff will continuously review all cases in
   an effort to keep the use of these restrictions to a minimum. A review will be conducted
   within 72-hours by corrections staff, who in turn makes the recommendation to the
   confinement officer for a decision. The facility commander, or designee, will formally advise
   the inmate of any decision to continue administrative segregation beyond the 72-hour period.
       5.8.1.1. Inmates in administrative segregation will be afforded the same cell furnishings
       as those not segregated. The confinement officer or designee determines when temporary
       removal of furnishings are necessary to prevent injury or property damage. Removal of
       furnishings will be reviewed every time an inmate’s status is reviewed.
       5.8.1.2. (REPLACE) . All pre-trial detainees in DoD confinement facilities will be
       housed in separate cells or sleeping areas, separated by sight, from post-trial inmates.
       They may share the same common areas at the same time. Pre-trial detainees are housed
       IAW Article 13, UCMJ.
       5.8.1.3. Female and male inmates can share the same common areas at the same time
       provided sufficient supervision is in place. Facilities designated for housing female
       inmates will be modified as required to provide for separate living and personal hygiene
       areas. Separate female and male living and hygiene areas by both sight and sound.
       5.8.1.4. Officer and enlisted segregation. Although DoD no longer requires separation of
       officer from enlisted inmates, facility staff may face unique challenges, which may
       warrant separate quarters. CSFs should consider the following issues when determining
       quarters: Chain-of-command, personal familiarity and other interpersonal associations
       that may adversely impact the safety and security of the facility and the effects of
       morale/welfare and good order and discipline of the installation. Officer inmates may
       share the same common areas as enlisted inmates at the same time. NOTE: HQ
       AFSFC/SFC will assist as necessary (IAW Paragraph 5.2) and when appropriate with
       transferring officers and senior enlisted inmates to serve their sentences at a location
       other than their home station.
 42                                               AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


       5.8.1.5. Segregate maximum custody inmates from all others.
   5.8.2. Disciplinary Segregation. Disciplinary segregation is a formal disciplinary measure
   and will be administered under administrative discipline per paragraph 8.8.5.2
   5.8.3. Special Quarters. Temporarily house inmates within the area used for administrative
   segregation, if their emotional state, adjustment to confinement, or mental/physical
   characteristics warrant such action. Normally, special quarters will be determined based upon
   the recommendations of professional medical support and treatment staff. If placed in special
   quarters for behavioral health reasons, a life skills professional must interview the inmate at
   least every 30 days.
   5.8.4. Confinement of Inmates under Sentence of Death. Segregate adjudged inmates who
   have been sentenced to death from the remainder of the inmate population at all times. Do
   not allow them to be commingled with other than death sentence inmates in housing,
   recreation, inmate employment and mealtime.
       5.8.4.1. Except in times of war, a long-term correction facility is the only authorized
       place to confine inmates under sentence of death.
       5.8.4.2. During times of war, the SAF may designate other facilities for such
       confinements.
5.9. Issuance and Control of Medication. Confinement officers establish local procedures for
secure storage, issue, accountability (log) and destruction of inmate medications. The corrections
staff strictly controls medical supplies and medication, documents all medication issues and
dispositions and files completed records in the CTF.
   5.9.1. Only medical personnel will administer controlled substances as medication for
   inmates/ detainees. Confinement NCOs, or after hours personnel in charge of the facility,
   after proper training from medical personnel, may administer inmate medication (other than
   controlled substances), as directed by medical personnel (ensure specific instructions are
   indicated). The confinement NCO, or others in charge of administering medication, will
   ensure the detainee/inmate consumes the medication in their presence.
   5.9.2. Over-the-counter medications (e.g., Tylenol, aspirin, etc.) may be maintained/issued
   for detainees/inmates in the facility. The confinement officer will maintain issue records in a
   log (see paragraph 5.9.3) and develop local procedures for over-the-counter medications in
   consult with medical authorities. All other self-medication for detainees/inmates is
   prohibited.
   5.9.3. Medication Log. The medication log is a permanent facility record. The log will
   indicate the inmate’s name and SSAN (last four). When the inmate’s medication was issued,
   the person issuing will annotate the starting medication count and number of medications
   issued. The person issuing and the inmate receiving the medication will print and sign the log
   entry.
5.10. Hospitalized Detainees/inmates. The medical officer on duty is responsible for all
inmate medical matters. The confinement officer is responsible for custody and control matters.
   5.10.1. The confinement officer provides the hospital commander a brief history of the
   inmate’s conduct and custody grade.
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                              43


   5.10.2. Detainees/inmates do not receive per diem or other TDY allowances while in a TDY
   status. When projecting detainees/inmates to go Temporary Duty (TDY) for hospitalization,
   the parent installation confinement officer:
       5.10.2.1. Informs the TDY installation CSF of the projected TDY.
       5.10.2.2. Provides the necessary transfer information.
       5.10.2.3. Establishes the inmate’s custody grade with the TDY installation CSF.
   5.10.3. The inmate’s parent unit commander provides escort and guard personnel when
   required, consistent with custody grade and security requirements.
5.11. Public Affairs. Access by the public to AFCS facilities should be limited to authorized
tours and visits. Care should be taken to avoid criticism, grounds of defamation, embarrassment
and mental anguish to detainees/inmates confined within the facility resulting from visit and tour
policies.
   5.11.1. Videotaping and photographing detainees/inmates will not be permitted except in
   support of medical documentation, for official identification purposes, (i.e., criminal
   activities) or IAW AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. If the inmate
   consents to a photograph, the inmate must sign a consent statement.
   5.11.2. Photographing an AFCS facility is not permitted unless authorized by the
   confinement officer or as an exception to policy when the stated purpose justifies such
   action. When photography is authorized, it will not include:
       5.11.2.1. Areas where detaining fences, restraining walls, bars, locks and other
       restraining devices are located.
       5.11.2.2. Scenes including inmates who are identifiable.
       5.11.2.3. Scenes depicting detainees/inmates under custodial control.
       5.11.2.4. Use of restraining devices.
   5.11.3. All requests for media interviews (face-to-face, on camera or telephonic) with
   military detainees/inmates should be coordinated with public affairs and security forces
   personnel. Media interviews must be conducted without compromising security procedures
   established by the confinement/corrections facility. Authorize written communication subject
   to the provisions of paragraph 6.3.2
   5.11.4. Written material prepared by detainees/inmates for publication must be submitted to
   the confinement officer or delegated representative for review prior to release. In addition,
   such material is subject to national security and policy review by Public Affairs under the
   provisions of AFI 35-101.
5.12. Alien Notification. When non-US citizens are convicted of crimes and confined in an
AFCS facility, forward the final judicial action (charges) and place of the incarceration to the US
Immigration and Naturalization Service, ATTN: Investigations Division; 4420 Fairfax Drive;
Arlington, VA 22203.
5.13. American Red Cross. The American Red Cross may be used, in accordance with existing
agreements, as an agency to provide detainees/inmates with timely community and family
information.

5.14. Release From Confinement. Inmate release is a two-step process. It begins with a pre-
release conference and ends with an actual release. Prior to the pre-release conference, acquire
professional assistance for the inmate through the Transition Assistance Program, if a punitive
discharge is to be executed. The installation CSF coordinates the release of inmates with the
installation commander and the unit commander when they complete their sentences to
confinement, or, are approved by the AFC&PB for release on parole. The Convening Authority
directs inmates to be placed on excess leave upon completion of confinement (reference AFI 51-
201, Administration of Military Justice.). The corrections staff, in the presence of the inmate’s
squadron commander or designated representative, conducts a pre-release conference with the
inmate three calendar days before release. Use DD Form 2718 to authorize release from
confinement. Note: When parent unit commander or designated representative are
geographically separated, the corrections staff provides a memorandum for record of the
conference details. The inmates are then released on their own recognizance. The confinement
officer releases pre-trial detainees upon order of an authorized official (i.e., confining official).
   5.14.1. The parent unit is responsible for submitting proper documentations to MPF/FSOs to
   place member on excess leave. Timely coordination with the confinement/corrections
   facility, unit commander and the MPF/FSOs ensures prompt release from confinement and
   the member will no longer be entitled to receive pay and allowances.
   5.14.2. Members approved for release on parole will be reassigned (PAS Code) to HQ
   AFSFC/SFC, Lackland AFB, TX. The permanent duty station will be USDB, Ft
   Leavenworth, KS or as designated by HQ AFSFC/SFC. Coordinate the transfer of members
   approved for release on parole with HQ AFSFC/SFC.
   5.14.3. A discharge or dismissal will not be executed until appellate review is completed and
   discharge or dismissal has been ordered executed (Final Order). An accused awaiting
   appellate review of an unsuspended punitive discharge, who has already completed the
   period of confinement, may be involuntarily placed on excess leave by direction of the
   convening authority IAW Article 76a, UCMJ and AFI 51-201. When legal reviews are
   completed, members will be discharged and AF Form 100, Request and Authorization for
   Separation and DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty will
   be executed and copies furnished to member. Members convicted of crimes at a TDY
   location (whether in TDY or PCS w/TDY Enroute status) will have punitive discharge (if
   any) executed by the CA of the servicing MPF.
   5.14.4. If released on parole or excess leave pending completion of appellate review, the
   inmate's unit ensures inmates and dependents are issued armed forces identification card(s)
   with an expiration date of one year from date of release. CFs and RCFs shall ensure DD
   Form 2717, Department of Defense Voluntary/Involuntary Appellate Leave Action, or
   comparable document is prepared and maintained upon each inmate’s final release from the
   facility. All military benefits associated with appellate leave cease when the discharge is
   executed. (This does not mean discharge from confinement – this means discharge from the
   service. Contact HQ AFSFC/SFC for additional information, if needed.)
   5.14.5. The confinement officer can provide release gratuities upon release from
   confinement at the expiration of sentence by punitive discharge or release on parole or
   appellate leave in accordance with the following:
       5.14.5.1. Civilian (appropriate) clothing if needed, for travel (provided by parent unit).

      personal outgoing mail. Issue as needed, but no more then 10 first class postage stamps
      and accompanying envelopes may be issued per month.
      6.1.1.3. If the facility does not allow detainees/inmates to have postage stamps in their
      possession, use DD Form 499, Prisoner’s Mail and Correspondence Record, to
      account for postage and control authorized correspondence.
   6.1.2. Detainees/inmates in non-pay status may use official mail for official correspondence
   subject to the following:
      6.1.2.1. Place a return address of a post office box or building number and installation on
      the envelope. Official envelopes for privileged correspondence will only be limited to
      reasonable quantities at the discretion of the CSF.

AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                               47


6.2. Inmate Finances. The inmate’s servicing Financial Services Office maintains pay records
unless otherwise directed by HQ AFSFC/SFC. When an inmate goes on excess leave, HQ
AFSFC/SFC will become the inmate's FSO.
6.3. Inmate Communications. The corrections staff ensures inmates receive postal service.
Other communications are permitted with certain limitations as allowed by the confinement
officer.
   6.3.1. The confinement officer or NCOIC, may authorize inmates to make outgoing calls.
   All long distance calls are collect to the party called. Calls may be monitored or recorded,
   unless they are between the inmate and an individual considered a privileged correspondent
   under paragraph 6.3.2.1
       6.3.1.1. For larger facilities, the confinement officer should consider installing
       commercial telephones that allow only collect calls. Limit calls made using government
       telephones to the local area or DSN for official business.
       6.3.1.2. Do not allow incoming calls except from the inmate’s attorney(s), commander or
       first sergeant. In addition, allow inmates to receive emergency telephone calls (after
       verification), through the corrections staff, if a death or serious illness occurs in the
       inmate’s immediate family.
   6.3.2. Inmates use normal mail to conduct non-emergency communications. Outgoing mail
   should have no markings or return address on the envelope, which indicate the inmate’s
   confinement status, past or present. The confinement officer ensures inmates are aware of
   what articles they may receive through the mail and that they must notify all authorized
   correspondents of the authorized articles. Except as provided in paragraph 6.3.2.1, below, the
   corrections staff inspects incoming and outgoing mail, to intercept contraband, (i.e., monies,
   valuables, stamps, etc.), to detect criminal activities and to control mail which violates postal
   regulations, contains obscenities, or communicates threats.
       6.3.2.1. All privileged communication outlined below is exempt from rejections or
       censorship. The confinement officer or appointee may inspect the communication in the
       presence of the inmate only if there is a reasonable basis to believe the mail contains
       contraband or for authenticity.
          6.3.2.1.1. President or Vice-President.
          6.3.2.1.2. Member of Congress.

          6.3.2.1.4. Attorney General or their representative.
          6.3.2.1.5. SAF or a representative.
          6.3.2.1.6. The Judge Advocate General or a representative.
          6.3.2.1.7. The Inspector General or a representative.
          6.3.2.1.8. Clergy. (NOTE: Verify address and clergy’s pastoral status)
          6.3.2.1.9. State and Federal courts.
          6.3.2.1.10. Inmate’s military or civilian attorney.

       6.3.2.2. The staff stores unauthorized items received in the mail with inmate’s personal
       property. They issue the inmate a receipt for such items.
   6.3.3. Except for Air Force Inspector General complaints, inmates submit complaints or
   requests, using a DD Form 510, Request for Interview, through the confinement officer or
   NCOIC, to the person or agency to which the complaints are submitted.
   6.3.4. Inspector General Complaints. Air Force inmates may submit complaints using the
   Air Force complaint system. Procedures vary based on the confinement/corrections location
   and the inmate’s command of assignment. Inmates wishing to complain about facility
   operations or procedures will use the complaint system of the facility housing them,
   regardless of which service operates the facility.
       6.3.4.1. Inmates housed in Level 1 CFs and RCFs not assigned to HQ AFSFC, submit
       Air Force specific complaints through their parent unit/installation complaint channels.
       6.3.4.2. Inmates assigned to HQ AFSFC submit Air Force specific complaints to HQ
       AFSFC/IG, 1517 Billy Mitchell Boulevard, Lackland AFB, TX 78236-0119.
6.4. Inmate Visits. Only persons authorized by the confinement officer or confinement NCOIC
may visit inmates. The confinement officer establishes visiting days and times locally and
ensures all visits are supervised. Normally correspondence between and visits by the inmate’s
spouse, children, parents, brothers and sisters should be approved unless the security needs of the
facility, protection of the victims, or the circumstances of the offense committed warrant
disapproval. An example would be visitation to sex offenders, who should not have contact, or
only limited supervised contact, with their victims, or with any minors, including their own
children. Prior to permitting such visitation, consult Family Advocacy Office, Child Protective
Worker (if assigned) or HQ AFSFC (Director, Inmate Clinical Services.) Disapproval of
correspondent and visitor requests shall be documented as a permanent part of the inmate's file.
   6.4.1. Visits will be documented, i.e., facility visitor log (hardcopy, or computerized).
   Facilities will determine files management locally, but as a minimum, will include the
   date/time of visit, name of inmate and visitors name. Access by the public to AFCS facilities
   should be limited to authorized tours and visits. Care should be taken to avoid criticism,
   embarrassment, mental anguish and grounds of defamation.
   6.4.2. Normally, visitor searches will be limited to checks of their person with a metal
   detection device and checks of handbags and parcels, before entering the facility. The
   installation CSF or designated representative (E-7 or above) has discretion to direct physical
   searches of visitors when deemed appropriate.
   6.4.3. Implement instructions to secure all visitors' hand carried items during a visit. Ideally,
   the storage area should have lockers with individual locks and keys that the visitor can keep
   during the period of visit.
   6.4.4. The confinement officer or NCOIC will determine if an inmate will be authorized
   contact or non-contact visitation. Non-contact visitation may be authorized in those instances
   of substantiated risks. Physical contact between visitors and inmates will be limited to a short
   embrace at the beginning and termination of the visit.
   6.4.5. Official Visits. Parent unit commanders or their appointees in the grade of E-7 or
   higher may visit detainees/inmates at anytime. If possible, provide separate visiting areas for
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                              49


   privileged communication visits (attorneys, chaplains, etc.). Maximum and medium-in
   custody inmate visits will take place in a secure area within the confinement/corrections
   facility. Visits with medium-out and minimum custody inmates may take place outside the
   facility (i.e., in the recreation yard or an adjacent picnic area) but only under supervision.
   There are no restrictions of official visits as long as they do not interrupt normal facility
   operations.
   6.4.6. Authorized Visits. Normally inmates can receive visitors on weekends and holidays.
   However, the confinement officer may grant exceptions to permit a visit during weekdays.
   For instance, when a visitor travels a long distance, or when such a visit appears advisable for
   other reasons. Maximum and medium-in custody inmate visits will take place in a secure
   area within the confinement/corrections facility. Visits with medium-out and minimum
   custody inmates may take place outside the facility (i.e., in the recreation yard or an adjacent
   picnic area) but only under supervision. The confinement officer approves group visits in
   advance.
       6.4.6.1. Inspect visiting rooms or areas for contraband before and after each visiting
       period. The corrections staff members search inmates before and after visits at the
       discretion of the confinement officer. These searches should take place out of sight of the
       visitors.
       6.4.6.2. Staff members should always treat visitors with courtesy and should never
       subject the inmate or visitor to any type of embarrassment during the visit.
       6.4.6.3. Do not allow victims of sexual offenses to visit the offender. However, in rare
       circumstances and after the Family Advocacy Officer and/or social worker assigned to
       the case and installation VWAP monitor concur, the installation CSF may approve such
       visits. For sexual offenders convicted of offenses against a child see paragraph 6.4
       6.4.6.4. Visitors must request advance approval from the confinement officer to visit an
       inmate on non-prescribed visiting days. If the visitor is requesting to visit an inmate
       convicted of offenses against a child, determine the age of the visitor to control contact
       with minors pursuant to paragraph 6.4 To the extent possible, accommodate visits by the
       inmate’s family members who arrive unannounced if they are not from the local area.
6.5. Support Services. Inmates receive other services from base support agencies in much the
same manner as active duty military. The inmate’s custody grade or local requirements
determine the level or extent of service.
   6.5.1. Inmates may request interviews with the American Red Cross by filling out a DD
   Form 510.
   6.5.2. Inmates receive the same medical and dental care as active duty persons, to include
   emergency services. Additionally, if a staff member determines an inmate requires
   immediate behavioral health care, the staff member contacts the servicing Life Skills clinic.
   6.5.3. The installation SJA provides legal assistance to inmates on personal civil legal
   matters IAW AFI 51-504, Legal Assistance, Notary and Preventive Law Programs. Inmates
   seeking advice on criminal matters should consult the area defense counsel or their appellate
   defense counsel. The SJA informs inmates of the status of their cases, sentences, or other
   legal matters.

   6.5.4. Inmates have the right to exercise religious beliefs, IAW DoDD 1300.17,
   Accommodation of Religious Practices within Military Services and the Religious Freedom
   Restoration Act. Confine-ment/corrections staff must understand and apply these guidelines
   when placing reasonable restrictions to maintain safety and security. Corrections personnel
   will respect the inmate’s religious beliefs. For example, while conducting in-processing or
   cell searches, treat religious items with care and respect. The installation chaplain appoints a
   chaplain staff representative to provide consultations and pastoral services for
   detainees/inmates.
   6.5.5. Detainees/inmates receive the same food service as active duty personnel.
       6.5.5.1. Detainees/inmates in segregation receive meals in their quarters.
       6.5.5.2. Annotate meal refusals in the Security Force Desk Blotter and CTF. Any
       significant and prolonged deviation (normally three consecutive days), from a normal diet
       must be referred to the medical officer for consultation.
   6.5.6. The confinement officer or NCOIC provides O&M funds for laundry service to
   detainees/ inmates in non-pay status. Detainees/inmates in pay status pay for the service.
   Allow use of washers and dryers if commercial or installation laundry and dry cleaning
   service is not available.
   6.5.7. The confinement officer/NCO arranges barber and beautician service with the Base
   Exchange or other contract service. Detainees/inmates in pay status pay for this service. Use
   O&M funds to pay for services inmates receive who are in a non-pay status.
   Detainees/inmates do not perform these services unless they are trained and certified by a
   certified barber or beautician.
6.6. Inmate Marriages. Inmate marriages are not prohibited, but should be encouraged to wait
until after sentence to confinement is complete for those housed in an AF Level 1 facility. For
further guidance, reference Attachment 24.

                    CLOTHING, PERSONAL PROPERTY AND FUNDS

7.1. Clothing. Pre-trial detainees and post-trial inmates confined in the AFCS (i.e., Level 1 CFs
and Level 1 RCFs) will wear the BDU uniform. Distinctive uniforms will only be authorized on
a case-by-case basis for those detainees/inmates posing a danger to the public or an escape risk
and then only after MAJCOM coordination and HQ AFSFC/SFC approval. (See 7.1.1 and 7.1.2
below) Approval may be requested via e-mail or telephone. An individual determined to be
appropriate for wear of a distinctive uniform may be inappropriate for confinement at a Level 1
facility. HQ AFSFC will determine potential transfer issues during distinctive uniform
consideration. NOTE: Refer to paragraph 1.2 for the AFCS philosophy. Placing
detainees/inmates, especially those with short sentences for relatively minor crimes, in clothing
that draws attention to their status, is detrimental to rehabilitative efforts as it further ostracizes
them from society. It is not appropriate to draw attention to detainees/inmates for the purpose of
―deterrence‖ to others, to ―remind‖ them of their status, or in any manner that would subject
them to ridicule or be degrading. Distinctive uniforms will normally not be approved for the
entire population of an AFCS facility. Facilities may utilize local custody identification cards
(i.e., name, SSN, custody grade/ status, photo) to further identify inmates. Installation O&M
funds will be used to purchase approved distinctive uniforms.
   7.1.1. (REPLACE) . Pre-trial detainees in AF confinement facilities. Individuals in this
   status will continue to wear the ABU/BDU uniform with authorized rank insignia, badges,
   patches, devices, etc. If it is determined by the CSF that a pre-trial detainee poses a threat
   and/or is an escape risk the CSF may seek HQ AFSFC/SFC approval for a distinctive
   uniform (recommended: white jumpsuit). (Call 1-877-273-3098 for the SFC duty officer.)
   The distinctive uniform may be used with the following items worn as a minimum: cloth
   USAF tape, cloth nametape and cloth rank insignia. An aircrew style patch may be used as a
   substitute for tapes/insignia. While housed in an AF confinement facility pre-trial detainees
   will not be placed in the same color of distinctive uniform worn by adjudged inmates IAW
   MCM, Part II, Chap. 3, Rule 304(f). NOTE: Pre-trial detainees housed at non-AF
   confinement facilities shall wear the uniform prescribed at that facility for the appropriate
   custody level.
   7.1.2. (REPLACE) . Adjudged/Sentenced inmates in AF confinement facilities. Individuals
   in this status are military members, however, they are not afforded many of the privileges of
   military members (see paragraph 5.3.3 and 8.2.10) and will wear the ABU/BDU uniform
   with only the cloth USAF tape and cloth name tape. If the CSF determines that an adjudged
   or sentenced inmate poses a threat and/or is an escape risk the CSF may seek HQ
   AFSFC/SFC approval for a distinctive uniform (recommended: orange jumpsuit). (Call 1-
   877-273-3098 for the SFC duty officer.) An aircrew style name patch may be used as a
   substitute for a nametape. EXCEPTION: All adjudged and sentenced inmates will wear
   grade insignia and authorized badges and devices only on service dress uniforms for court
   proceedings/hearings (and church services, only if other military members are in attendance),
   if not a threat/escape risk. NOTE: Inmates who are not reduced to Airman Basic, or for
   officer inmates, no rank insignia will be worn during the period of confinement. This aspect
   is for the purpose of inmate population management and control and is not to be viewed as a
 52                                               AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


   form of ―punishment‖. Also, adjudged/sentenced inmates housed at non-AF confinement
   facilities shall wear the uniform prescribed at that facility for the appropriate custody level.
   7.1.3. The parent unit commander ensures an detainee/inmate has all required clothing upon
   entry into confinement. Unless otherwise approved by HQ AFSFC/SFC, detainees/inmates
   will have, as a minimum, one complete set of service dress, four complete sets of BDUs, one
   field jacket (or GORTEX), one short sleeve light blue shirt (or service equivalent), one pair
   of boots, one pair of low quarter shoes, appropriate belts, headgear, undergarments, socks
   and one set of athletic attire and athletic shoes. The parent unit provides missing or
   unserviceable items prior to confinement or transfer.
   7.1.4. When necessary, the corrections staff removes items the inmate could use to inflict
   self-injury.
   7.1.5. (NEW) Pre-trial detainee travel uniform exceptions. Provided custody classification
   does not dictate a distinctive uniform, pre-trial detainees confined at non-DoD correctional
   institutions, as described in paragraph 1.2.2.1, will be afforded the earliest reasonable
   opportunity to change into an Air Force duty uniform after transport to a DoD installation.
   During transport the pre-trial detainee may wear the uniform prescribed at that facility or the
   appropriate custody classification uniform. When returning to the non-DoD correctional
   institution, pre-trial detainees will be afforded the latest reasonable opportunity to change
   back into the uniform prescribed by that institution or the appropriate custody classification
   uniform.
7.2. Personal Property. Confinement officers authorize possession of personal property. The
corrections staff inspects and inventories all personal property brought to the facility by the
inmate. The inmate and their parent unit are responsible for disposing of unauthorized personal
property. Corrections staff members use AF Form 807, Receipt-Inmate’s Personal Property, to
document personal property and file in CTF.
7.3. Funds. The installation CSF appoints a primary and alternate personal deposit fund (PDF)
custodian by letter and furnishes a copy to the servicing bank and FSO. The custodian deposits
inmate personal funds into the PDF. The custodian may use on base banking facilities, charging
bank fees and costs to the installation O&M fund. The custodian uses the PDF to purchase health
and comfort items as well as other inmate expenditures (dependent support, educational material,
attorney fees, debts, etc.). The custodian maintains the PDF using the guidelines below:
   7.3.1. Balance the PDF each duty day and conduct an audit at least quarterly by a
   disinterested party unassociated with the PDF (Attachment 19) in the grade of E-7 or above
   or civilian equivalent. This reporting requirement is exempt from licensing in accordance
   with paragraph 2.11.2 of AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and Reports Management
   Program.
   7.3.2. Changes of custodian require transfer of PDF accountability. Use the certificate at
   Attachment 20 to document the custodian change.
   7.3.3. Secure all cash, checks, vouchers and receipts according to AFI 31-209, Air Force
   Resource Protection Program.
   7.3.4. Use AF Form 1387, Receipt-Inmate’s Personal Deposit Fund, to receipt for all
   funds (negotiable instruments). Deposit only military paychecks, PDF custodian checks,
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                             53


  money orders, cashier checks, cash, or non-US currency in the PDF account. Do not accept
  personal checks. The servicing bank determines exchange rates for non-US currency. Provide
  the inmate a copy of the AF Form 1387 as a receipt and file the duplicate copy with the AF
  Form 1388, Summary Receipt Voucher-Inmate’s Personal Deposit Fund.
     7.3.4.1. Use a duplicate copy of a payroll statement to post amounts credited to each
     inmate’s account and file a copy with the AF Form 1388.
     7.3.4.2. Do not use the AF Form 1387 to receipt for payroll deposits to a PDF account.
  7.3.5. Use AF Form 1388 to total daily receipts and assign a voucher number to the form,
  (i.e., AXX-01). XX indicates the last two digits of the current year; and 01 indicates the first
  voucher of the year, add a number for each subsequent voucher. This procedure applies to
  AF Forms 1391 and 1393.
  7.3.6. Use AF Form 808, Cash Account-Inmate’s Personal Deposit Fund, to
  chronologically post and balance each inmate’s account.
     7.3.6.1. Detainees/inmates verify their personal cash accounts, upon request, on the AF
     Form 808.
     7.3.6.2. Upon release or transfer, detainees/inmates verify the account and the custodian
     draws a check for the listed balance, annotates a "0" in the balance column and writes or
     stamps "account closed" following the last entry on the form. The custodian authenticates
     the entry with his or her signature. All entries are in ink.
  7.3.7. The PDF custodian makes deposits daily, if possible, but at least weekly. Deposit
  receipts for more than $100 by the next banking day. Detainees/inmates endorse all checks
  "FOR DEPOSIT ONLY" to the PDF account. Maintain a check deposit receipt or duplicate
  of the deposit slip with the AF Form 1388.

                                            Chapter 8

                                  CONTROL OF INMATES

8.1. Internal Control. Facilities maintain inmate control by the impartial enforcement of
reasonable rules and regulations necessary for safe and orderly operation of CFs or RCFs. The
confinement officer establishes local procedures for the control of all assigned inmates and the
security of the quarters’ area, facility entrance, work and recreation area and other areas deemed
appropriate.
   8.1.1. Inmate counts verify the inmate population. As a minimum, conduct inmate counts at
   shift change, during sleeping hours (irregular checks), during work hours or when inmates
   are away from the facility (by telephone or in person) to ensure accountability on a 24-hour
   basis.
   8.1.2. Normally, do not wake inmates to accomplish inmate counts during sleeping hours,
   except when an inmate cannot be physically seen or during emergencies such as fire or
   immediate inmate counts due to an escape.
8.2. Local Area Escorts. The confinement officer ensures compliance with prescribed security
requirements based on the custody grade and classification of the inmate. The use of a vehicle
driver as an escort is up to the discretion of the installation CSF when inmates are escorted
outside the facility, but within the installation. Release inmates via DD Form 2708, Receipt of
Inmate or Detained Person, to non-facility personnel and provide an escort briefing. When off
the installation, the vehicle driver will not be used as an escort. Escorts will be military or DoD
civilians.
   8.2.1. When mixing custody grades for escort, the most restrictive escort procedures will be
   used according to classification.
   8.2.2. Escort maximum custody inmates with two personnel, at least one of which is an
   armed security force member. Use approved restraining devices, i.e., handcuffs, belly
   chain/belt and leg irons as appropriate.
   8.2.3. Parent unit personnel escort medium-in custody inmates using a ratio of one escort per
   inmate. When escorted by security forces, the ratio is one per two inmates. When inmates
   require restraint during movement, escorts must be trained on the use of restraint devices.
   8.2.4. Parent unit personnel escort medium-out custody inmates using a ratio of one escort
   per three inmates. When escorted by security forces, the ratio is one per six inmates.
   8.2.5. Parent unit personnel escort minimum custody inmates using a ratio of one escort per
   five inmates. Inmates in this custody grade may be signed out for work details. Local
   procedures must be established for escorts of these inmates while away from the facility.
   When using security forces, the ratio is one per ten.
   8.2.6. Local area escorts. For local area escorts the parent unit commander and the CSF will
   determine appropriate escort rank, which must be at least an E-5 (or GS equivalent) if a non-
   SF escort is used. Security forces and parent units must be careful not to assign escort duty to
   any person who may sympathize with the inmate (i.e., a peer who previously worked with the
 56                                                AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


   inmate). Rank restrictions do not apply to security forces personnel responsible for local area
   escorts or inmate security/control.
   8.2.7. The corrections staff briefs escorts on inmate security requirements prior to departing
   the confinement/corrections facility. The greatest opportunity for escape attempt exists while
   an inmate is away from the confinement/corrections facility. Inmates are always under escort
   when away from the facility. Because of escape opportunities during an escort situation,
   escorts require training by the corrections staff. An assigned trainer should emphasize escort
   responsibilities to include:
       8.2.7.1. Responsibilities for the safety and welfare of the inmate and the public.
       8.2.7.2. The inmate’s custody grades (related requirements) and any special instructions
       such as controlling and administering prescribed medication.
       8.2.7.3. Detailed instructions for unplanned or emergency situations such as unexpected
       delays during transfer, escape or attempted escape and medical emergencies.
       8.2.7.4. How and when to use restraining devices.
       8.2.7.5. Reporting instructions at the final destination (if any).
       8.2.7.6. Disposition of the inmate’s property (in case of transfer).
   8.2.8. Escorts should never allow an inmate to leave their control (before properly
   relinquishing control to competent authority such as the inmate’s attorney or the corrections
   staff). One means of maintaining constant control is with restraining devices. Confinement
   officers determine what devices, if any, to use while the inmate is away from the facility.
   8.2.9. Corrections staff will train escorts on the use of restraining devices and escape
   prevention measures. Escorts should never allow an inmate to lag behind or leave the
   immediate area of the escort. This gives an inmate a slight advantage if escape is on their
   mind. Visual contact, coupled with the ability to achieve immediate physical contact with an
   inmate, will deter most escape attempts.
   8.2.10. Unless it degrades security, unrestrained inmates are not denied the privilege of
   rendering the hand salute when appropriate.
8.3. Contraband Control. Local instructions must specify what items an inmate can have in
their possession. Anything else, or any amounts in excess of what is prescribed is considered
contraband. The corrections staff prohibits items, which threaten the safety or security of the
facility, staff and inmate population, or are prohibited by law or directives. They control
contraband through close supervision and unannounced searches.
8.4. Inmate Searches. Staff members do not conduct searches on inmates of the opposite sex
unless required for emergency purposes. Search techniques trained by civilian correctional
courses will be coordinated and approved with the local SJA, MAJCOM and HQ AFSFC/SFC.
Recommend using latex protective gloves during searches of the inmate and clothing to protect
against blood borne pathogens. Follow the basic rules below:
   8.4.1. Conduct simple searches for contraband or weapons anytime the inmate leaves or
   returns to the facility, before and after visits and as determined by the confinement officer.
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                                57


   8.4.2. Conduct complete searches as part of inmate in-processing and as determined by the
   confinement officer. This search includes removing and checking all jewelry and clothing
   from the inmate, combing out hair, checking underarms, between fingers and toes and foot
   soles. Check under any bandages or tape unless removal could inflict further injury. While
   corrections staff may visually check body openings and orifices, they do not use any type of
   probe or poking device to check these areas. Only medical personnel may physically examine
   interior body openings. The person placing the inmate into confinement (usually, an escort,
   first sergeant, or commander) should remain at the facility at least until the search is
   complete. This allows the corrections staff to return any contraband for disposition.
   Following the initial confinement search, have the inmate shower and then issue clean,
   previously searched clothing.
   8.4.3. Conduct searches of cells/bays and areas of the facility. Remove inmates from the
   cell/bay area and search all interior and exterior areas of the facility. Searches of quarters for
   contraband should be completed at irregular intervals. The amount of contraband found
   during these searches largely determines the frequency of such searches. Large amounts of
   contraband should result in more frequent searches. Search all visiting areas before and after
   visitation. Search doorways, recreation areas and outside areas at irregular intervals. Handle
   property carefully.
8.5. Emergency Plans. Confinement officers ensure they have emergency plans for their
facility. Specific actions are dependent upon local conditions and nature of the emergency. As a
minimum, the plan must include: Emergency evacuations (fire/structural damage), response to
disturbances and disorders, hostage situations, bomb threats, natural disasters, medical
emergency response, power failures, apprehension of escapees, forced cell moves/extractions.
Plans must focus on control and safety of inmates and staff and include primary/alternate
assembly locations. Coordinate plans with appropriate installation agencies, as required and
tailor to local needs. Additionally, the confinement officer or appointee:
   8.5.1. Posts these plans within the facility and ensures supporting checklists, special
   instructions and other appropriate documentation are available at the facility, law
   enforcement desk, or other location designated by the installation CSF. Attachment 6 is a
   list of recommended points to address in each emergency action plan.
   8.5.2. Trains all personnel assigned to the facility or responsible for the inmate population in
   implementing the emergency plans. Tests emergency plans as determined locally.
   8.5.3. Develops plans to establish, train, equip and supervise a Forced Cell Move Team to
   respond to situations requiring individual inmate interventions. Situations requiring
   employment of the team may include an inmate refusing to exit a cell or other location, an
   inmate undergoing behavioral health related ―acting out‖, or any other situation requiring use
   of physical forced to subdue an individual inmate. Forced cell move situations are not to be
   confused with multiple inmate unrest situations. You may obtain a Forced Cell Move lesson
   plan from the AFSFC website or HQ AFSFC/Det 1 Air Force Liaison, United States
   Disciplinary Barracks (USDB), 1301 N. Warehouse Road, Fort Leavenworth, KS 66027-
   2304.
8.6. Weapons and Other Means of Force. Corrections staff members always use the
minimum force necessary. In addition to the requirements stated in AFI 31-207, Arming and Use
 58                                               AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


of Force by Air Force Personnel, other requirements apply to corrections staff using force in CFs
or RCFs
   8.6.1. Do not use weapons when escorting or supervising medium or minimum custody
   inmates, unless the supervisor’s routine duties require a weapon; i.e., law enforcement desk
   sergeant or a law enforcement patrol.
   8.6.2. Never carry a weapon (firearm, club and or baton) or Ortho-Chlorobenzylidene
   Malonitrile (CS) gas or Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) pepper spray into the
   confinement/corrections facility except in emergency situations as directed by the CSF.
   8.6.3. The CSF authorizes the use of military working dogs (MWDs) to augment other
   inmate control procedures (prohibitions referenced in paragraph 4.5.6 still apply). Consider
   other methods of inmate control (i.e., CS gas or OC pepper spray) and MWD safety prior to
   authorizing the use of an MWD. When using MWD(s) for inmate control ensure the dog
   remains under total control of the handler. This does not prevent using MWDs for contraband
   control or as part of a team for a show of force during disorders.
   8.6.4. Use decisive action to quell disturbances. Chemical irritants or high-pressure water
   may be used in extreme situations, but only under the order of the confinement officer or
   higher authority. Ensure only trained persons administer CS gas and that a supply of CS gas
   and gas masks are available. When possible, the corrections staff should videotape all actions
   involving use of force within the corrections environment. The tape could protect both the
   staff and the inmates should the need arise. Examples of minimum force are:
       8.6.4.1. Unarmed Restraint Techniques. Unarmed restraint techniques are effective for
       self-defense, to prevent escape, to prevent an injury to persons or damage to property, or
       to quell a disturbance. To control or move an unruly inmate, get help from corrections or
       other security force personnel to preclude the need to strike or inflict bodily injury on the
       inmate.
       8.6.4.2. Equipment and additional personnel. A show of force consists of demonstrating
       to inmates engaged in a disturbance or general disorder that equipment and personnel are
       available for use to quell such disorders. This force consists of sufficient personnel and
       equipment to apply the measures of force required by the situation. If the disturbance has
       not reached the state of overt violence and lives and the security of the facility are not in
       danger, the CSF or designee should consider making an attempt to reason with leaders of
       the disturbance prior to further application of force. Steps to quell the disturbance may
       include:
           8.6.4.2.1. Informing leaders of the disturbance that forces, equipment and facilities
           are available to reestablish control and continuing the disorder would be futile. This
           action is not the same as bargaining or making concessions.
           8.6.4.2.2. Issuing an order to personnel engaged in the disturbance to end their
           actions (this is more effective if the force is present).
           8.6.4.2.3. Immediately applying stronger measures of force to contain the situation
           when all attempts to reason have failed. Do not bluff.
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                               59


       8.6.4.3. Employing riot control formations. The CSF may direct using riot control teams
       and tactics when deemed necessary. In order to restore a disorder to normal and peaceful
       operations, SF personnel must be proficient in these tactics and formations.
       8.6.4.4. Firearms. CSF may approve using firearms only when all other means of
       restoring order have failed. ONLY THE GRAVEST AND MOST UNUSUAL
       SITUATION REQUIRES THE USE OF FIREPOWER. For the safety of staff members
       and inmates, the following rules apply:
           8.6.4.4.1. Armed escorts of maximum custody inmates should have a weapon most
           suited to the existing conditions. In selecting the type of weapon, consider the attitude
           and conduct of inmates, training of the supervisors, population density of the area,
           proximity of explosives or flammable materials, numbers of supervisors available and
           any other local factors which may be pertinent.
           8.6.4.4.2. Hospitalized maximum custody inmates should be in a secure ward when
           available. When secure wards are not available, guards may carry handguns when the
           situation warrants.
           8.6.4.4.3. The use of a firearm must be in compliance with AFI 31-207, Arming and
           Use of Force by Air Force Personnel.
8.7. Escape of Inmate or Detainee. For the purposes of apprehension and return to military
control, an escapee is any inmate who is absent from custody or confinement, fails to return from
temporary parole; or has been released on parole and fails to return after proper authority has
suspended or revoked the parole, except those suspended without prejudice.
   8.7.1. In cases of inmates who are members of other services, procedures in this paragraph
   regarding reporting, disposition of records and detainers, should be modified to meet
   requirements of the service of which the inmate is a member.
   8.7.2. If a detainee/inmate escapes or fails to return, the corrections staff immediately
   prepares DD Form 553, Deserter/Absentee Wanted by the Armed Forces and distributes
   the form pursuant to the provisions of AFI 36-2911, Desertion and Unauthorized Absence. In
   addition the confinement officer, installation commander or designated representative will
   communicate directly and expeditiously with the police agency of the military installation
   nearest an escapee’s home of record, home of escapee’s spouse, close friends and other
   logical sources requesting assistance in apprehending the escaped inmate. Additionally the
   confinement officer or appointee will:
       8.7.2.1. Initiates OPREP-3 procedures as stated in paragraph 3.7
       8.7.2.2. Notify the MAJCOM/SF and HQ AFSFC/SFC via OPREP-3 Beeline.
       8.7.2.3. Ensure VWAP notifications are made in accordance with paragraph 3.2.6
       8.7.2.4. Use AF Form 807 to inventory the escaped inmate’s property and personal
       effects as soon as possible after escape. Deposit funds found in the inmate’s personal
       effects into the PDF.
       8.7.2.5. Escaped inmates who are not captured within 90 days will be dropped from
       confinement accountability rolls; however, the CTF will be retained at the facility. Return
       any personal property to the parent unit for disposition. Turn funds over to the servicing
 60                                              AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


      FSO, which holds the funds until the inmate returns to military control. Make the check
      payable to the servicing FSO.
      8.7.2.6. The CSF prepares and forwards lessons learned report to HQ AFSFC/SFC
      through their MAJCOM within 30 days of escape. HQ AFSFC/SFC will coordinate with
      AFPC to make appropriate personnel actions on the escapee.
   8.7.3. When an escapee (or AWOL/deserter) is located in custody of civil authorities, a
   detainer, in coordination with SJA, will be placed with the civil authorities for return of the
   inmate to military control. The nearest Air Force installation security forces will be
   responsible for returning the Air Force escapee to military control for the completion of any
   remaining period of confinement. For travel expenditures for the return of absentees,
   deserters and escapees, reference AFI 65-601Vl, Budget Guidance and Procedures,
   paragraph 12.7. Request complete information from civil authorities, such as the offense the
   escapee committed, the length of confinement and pertinent social history while in escapee
   status. DD Form 616, Report of Return of Absentee, will be completed and distributed per
   instructions in AFI 36-2911.
   8.7.4. Parole Violators. The USDB Parole Section will complete a DD Form 553 when a
   parolee’s parole has been suspended or revoked. HQ AFSFC/SFC will assist in securing an
   AF fund site so the nearest Air Force installation security forces unit can provide escorts for
   the return of a parole violator.
   8.7.5. If an inmate being transferred escapes, the installation from which they are being
   transferred will be responsible for the procedures indicated above as well as telephonic
   notifications and reporting procedures. Unless otherwise directed by HQ AFSFC/SFC,
   CONUS inmates who escape are returned to the installation from which they escaped. For
   OCONUS inmates who escape in CONUS, the gaining installation or facility will be
   responsible.
   8.7.6. All escapes and major disorders will be formally investigated.
   8.7.7. Once the escapee is returned to military control, a medical examination is conducted
   for signs of communicable or contagious diseases. HIV, TB, Hep-B, pregnancy and drug
   testing will be completed within 24 hours of the return.
8.8. Discipline and Control Measures.
   8.8.1. Discipline
      8.8.1.1. Punishable Conduct. While confined at military confinement/corrections
      facilities, all inmates are subject to disciplinary action for violations of the UCMJ,
      relevant federal laws and institutional rules, even after discharge from the service. This
      jurisdiction over an inmate continues even after departing a military
      confinement/corrections facility (i.e., parole or excess leave), as long as the inmate
      remains under the administrative control of the Air Force Corrections System or the
      armed services. Misconduct is dealt with through trial by courts-martial, charges brought
      before a Discipline and Adjustment Board (D&A Board) see paragraph 8.8.3 and other
      management or administrative actions. Actions taken as a result of a D&A Board do not
      preclude punishment under the UCMJ.
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                            61


     8.8.1.2. Legal Procedures. When appearance before a D&A Board is required, the inmate
     suspected of the offense receives written notice stating the following:
         8.8.1.2.1. Violation(s) charged.
         8.8.1.2.2. That the inmate has the right to a minimum of 24-hours notice of the
         charges prior to the board convening. (If an inmate is scheduled to be released from
         confinement before the expiration of the 24-hour period, they may be required to
         appear before the D&A board prior to expiration of the 24-hour notification period.)
         8.8.1.2.3. The right to consult with an attorney before the convening of the three-
         member board, but not the right of representation by an attorney during the board
         proceedings. Respondents appearing before a one-member board are not afforded the
         right to consult with an attorney.
         8.8.1.2.4. The right to present relevant evidence at the hearing, both in defense and in
         extenuation and mitigation. At three-member boards, an inmate also has the right to
         request the presence of accusers and merit witnesses, as well as examine or cross-
         examine accusers and witnesses through the Chairman of the Board.
         8.8.1.2.5. The right to be present for all open sessions of the D&A Board hearing,
         unless the respondent declines to appear or is removed for misconduct. Any absence
         will be noted in the summarized record and supported by appropriate documentation
         to establish the circumstances of declination or removal for cause.
     8.8.1.3. Inmates charged with an Air Force confinement/corrections facility violation
     may seek legal counsel. Legal counsel is limited to assisting the inmate prepare for the
     D&A Board, since legal counsel is not authorized at a D&A Board. Legal defense
     services can assist inmates in preparing a request to review the investigative file prior to
     the D&A Board. Inmates may request a delay in the hearing by submitting a written
     request to the D&A Board Chairman. Reasons for the request must be fully explained and
     warranted before being granted.
     8.8.1.4. Violations of facility rules or commission of an offense could result in forfeiture
     of all or part of any earned GCT or EGCT. The confinement officer will use the
     Discipline and Adjustment Board (see paragraph 8.8.3) to make recommendations to the
     CSF, for forfeitures of GCT or ECGT. The CSF approves forfeited or withheld GCT or
     EGCT. Adjust an inmate’s MRD (factoring in granted or forfeited GCT and EGCT)
     monthly (see paragraph 5.7.1.2.2.3).
  8.8.2. Disposition of adverse reports is accomplished by any of the following actions:
     8.8.2.1. Filing a DD Form 2714, Inmate Disciplinary Report as an unfavorable
     Incident/Observation Report in the Correctional Treatment File (CTF).
     8.8.2.2. A hearing under Article 72, UCMJ, to vacate a previously suspended court-
     martial sentence.
     8.8.2.3. Referral to a D&A Board for either a one-member or three-member board.
     8.8.2.4. Non-judicial Punishment.
     8.8.2.5. Recommendation for trial by court-martial.
62                                             AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


  8.8.3. Discipline and Adjustment Board. A D&A Board will be convened for the purpose of
  evaluating all facts and circumstances surrounding the inmate misconduct, infractions,
  violations of confine-ment/corrections facility rules and violations of the UCMJ. A D&A
  Board is required in order to impose loss of good time on the inmate. Depending on the
  severity of the infraction, the confinement officer determines if a one or three member D&A
  board will be convened. Inmates proposed for a one-member board will be offered the
  opportunity to request a three-member discipline and adjustment board. This advisement will
  also provide a comparison of the levels of punishment involved in each particular board.
     8.8.3.1. The Board Chairman of a D&A Board (one or three member) must be a
     disinterested (Reference terms in Attachment 1) E-7 or above, or civilian equivalent.
     The other two panel members for a three-member Board must be E-5 or above, or civilian
     equivalent. Members of the D&A Board must not be assigned to the security forces unit,
     inmate’s unit or units of victims or witnesses. In addition to the DD Form 2714, Inmate
     Disciplinary Report, the D&A Board will make a written record of the evidence
     presented at the hearing and state the reasons for recommending disciplinary action, if
     applicable. In making its recommendations, the D&A Board must give full consideration
     to the causes for the adverse behavior, the setting and the circumstances in which it
     occurred, the individual’s accountability and the correctional treatment goals. The Board
     should recommend disciplinary measures only to regulate and control the inmate’s
     behavior as necessary within acceptable limits and are never to be recommended
     capriciously or in the nature of revenge or retaliation. Imposed disciplinary actions
     should be progressive in nature. Each case is considered individually and on its own
     merits, based on a thorough and impartial evaluation of all relevant facts and
     circumstances. The corrections staff files a copy of the DD Form 2714 and Board
     findings memo in the CTF.
     8.8.3.2. Installation commanders or appointees can, in addition to or instead of,
     punishments prescribed by law, impose administrative disciplinary measures on inmates
     under their jurisdiction to maintain control, protect the safety and welfare of inmates and
     other personnel and to assure the orderly operation and administration of AFCS facilities.
     Installation commanders may delegate the approving authority to impose administrative
     disciplinary measures to the installation CSF. The Board will recommend action to the
     approval authority. The approving authority may reduce the D&A Board findings and
     decrease recommended punishment as appropriate, but not increase punishment.
     8.8.3.3. The corrections staff documents facility rule violations and behavior problems
     on DD Form 2714. The installation CSF approves corrective action. The confinement
     officer or appointee will ensure the inmate receives a copy of the D&A Board Findings
     Memorandum and the DD Form 2714.
     8.8.3.4. General Board Procedures:
         8.8.3.4.1. When an inmate is having difficulty comprehending the English language,
         or the complexity of the issues require special assistance, a request may be made to
         the D&A Board Chairman to have a staff member act as an interpreter or
         spokesperson for the inmate.
         8.8.3.4.2. Witnesses. At the time the inmate is notified of the anticipated D&A Board
         appearance date, the inmate must provide their final list of merit witnesses. Merit
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                             63


           witnesses are those members the inmate wants to appear at the Board and are the only
           witnesses the D&A Board staff will notify to be present for the hearing. When an
           inmate receives written notice, or at any time thereafter, up to 24-hours in advance of
           the hearing, the inmate may request to review the investigative D&A Board file.
           8.8.3.4.3. Formal reply to charges. After rights advisement against self-incrimination
           and the reading of the alleged violation(s), the Board chairman will ask the inmate if
           they understand each charge. All questions are resolved before continuing. The
           inmate must either:
               8.8.3.4.3.1. Plead GUILTY to any or all violations.
               8.8.3.4.3.2. Plead NOT GUILTY to any or all violations.
               8.8.3.4.3.3. Plead NO PLEA to any or all violations. No Plea is neither a ―guilty‖
               or ―not guilty‖ plea, but allows inmates to explain the circumstances surrounding
               the infraction and allows the Board to determine the guilt or innocence of the
               inmate. NOTE: If the inmate fails to enter a plea to a charge, the Board chairman
               directs the recorder to enter a plea of ―NO PLEA.‖
           8.8.3.4.4. Board Findings. Once all relevant and available evidence has been
           presented, the Board reconvenes in a closed session to consider all facts, reasonable
           inferences/deductions and conclusions. The Board may enter one of the following
           findings per charge:
               8.8.3.4.4.1. GUILTY – A majority (2 to 1) of the Board members must be
               convinced the inmate committed the charged violation, or a lesser included
               offense of the charged violation.
               8.8.3.4.4.2. ACQUITTED – If the Board members cannot obtain a majority (2 to
               1) vote to convict on any specific charge, the finding will be entered as
               ―Acquitted.‖ Do not file or record findings in the inmate’s CTF for inmates who
               are acquitted.
               8.8.3.4.4.3. DISMISSED – Is entered when the Board unanimously finds the
               charge is not a violation of AFI 31-205 or the UCMJ, or the charge is
               multiplicious (charges describe the same misconduct) with other violations for
               which the inmate was found ―Guilty.‖ Do not file or record findings in the
               inmate’s CTF for inmates who are acquitted.
           8.8.3.4.5. In the case of a ―Guilty‖ finding, violations may be considered individually
           or together in determining the Board’s recommendations. The Board considers, but is
           not bound to give credit for time spent in Administrative Segregation Pending
           Investigation (ASPI). Subject to category limitations, one and three member Boards
           may recommend any of the actions listed below:

Table 8.1. D&A Board Administrative Disciplinary Actions.

6. H&C Reduction/Restriction                                  No               Yes
7. Forfeiture of GCT/EGCT                                     No               Yes
8. Vacating Suspended (D&A) Actions                      Yes (minor)           Yes

   8.8.4. Appeals.
       8.8.4.1. D&A Board recommendations that result in approved disciplinary segregation,
       forfeitures of GCT or EGCT may only be appealed to the superior of the approving
       authority. D&A Board cases not resulting in disciplinary action as listed above are final
       and not subject to appeal. Forward all appeals through the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA).
       8.8.4.2. Appeals must be submitted to the SJA within three working days of
       acknowledgement of receipt of the action. When circumstances prevent an inmate from
       presenting the appeal during this period, the inmate may submit a request for delay to the
       SJA within the initial appeal period, with a statement describing the circumstances that
       necessitate the delay. SJA reviews the request and grants delays where warranted,
       however, a delay is not automatic.
       8.8.4.3. An appeal must have substantive merit, or it is returned by the SJA without
       further action. Appeals must be based upon showing that findings of the Board were in
       error, the hearing did not comply with applicable requirements, or the corrective actions
       were too severe.
       8.8.4.4. Approved D&A Board recommendations are ordered into immediate execution
       without regard to appeal action.
       8.8.4.5. Inmates are provided written notification of appeal results, normally within 30
       days of the date received by SJA.
   8.8.5. Category of Offenses and Punishment.
       8.8.5.1. Violations of this AFI are divided into five categories. Each category has
       recommended maximum disciplinary and management actions. These actions will not be
       exceeded, unless one of the following conditions are met:
           8.8.5.1.1. The D&A Board members believe the maximum level should be exceeded
           due to unusual circumstances. The D&A Board chairman will justify in writing to the
           CSF the reasons for recommending actions that exceed the category level.
           8.8.5.1.2. The D&A Board may recommend actions not to exceed the next higher
           category of the latest offense if the inmate has two or more guilty findings (during
           separate board proceedings) within a 90-day period.
       8.8.5.2. The maximum recommended disciplinary and management actions for each
       category of Air Force confinement/corrections facility offenses are listed below. A
       definition of each offense is at Attachment 5.

8.9. Administrative or Disciplinary Segregation. Confinement officers determine when to use
segregation to prevent injury, maintain health, or discipline standards. Segregation provides a
secure setting for isolation or intensive correctional treatment. The corrections staff keeps
segregated inmates under close supervision, conducting frequent checks throughout the 24-hour
day. Facility commanders or their designated representative shall conduct a daily visit to all
inmates in disciplinary segregation.
     8.9.1. Within 24-hours of an inmate’s entry into segregation, the confinement officer
     reviews the circumstances behind the segregation and the need for further segregation.
     8.9.2. Medical staff members evaluate each inmate as soon as possible within 24-hours of
     entering administrative or disciplinary segregation. Thereafter, medical personnel shall visit
     at least once every 72-hours to evaluate inmate’s health and the sanitary conditions. The
     facility commander shall be notified of any unhealthy, unsafe, or unsanitary condition for
     immediate corrective action. Confine-ment/corrections staff records the evaluations and cell
     checks on a DD Form 509, Inspection Record of Prisoner in Segregation.
8.10. Suicide Watch. Confinement officers determine when it is necessary to place
detainees/inmates on suicide watch to prevent injury, maintain health, or discipline standards.
The confinement officer develops procedures to ensure the safety of suicidal inmates.
Detainees/inmates are segregated to protect themselves against self harm and a medical officer
will evaluate the individual and make a determination regarding the appropriateness of continued
segregation as soon as possible and within 24-hours of the initiation of segregation. Additionally,
a medical authority will review the appropriateness of continued suicide watch at a minimum
every 24-hours after the initiation of the segregation to evaluate their health and sanitary
conditions. The facility commander shall be notified of any unhealthy, unsafe, or unsanitary
condition for immediate corrective action. Corrections staff records the evaluations on a DD
Form 509, Inspection Record of Prisoner in Segregation. Facility commanders or their
designated representative shall conduct a daily visit to all detainees/inmates in suicide watch.
     8.10.1. Suicide watch cells will not contain anything an detainee/inmate can use to self-
     inflict injury. Items to be considered for removal may include clothing, safety razors,
     removable or breakable hard plastics or metal objects (including bed parts), or glass. Suicide
     watch cells will have hard deck ceilings.
     8.10.2. Staff members conduct frequent (not to exceed 15 minutes) randomly spaced cell
     checks. The confinement officer determines if CCTV coverage of suicide watch
     detainees/inmates is sufficient instead of 15-minute physical checks. Regardless of the
     manner used, confinement/corrections staff records the cell checks on a DD Form 509,
     Inspection Record of Prisoner in Segregation.
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                      69


  8.10.3. Ensure established procedures exist and are followed. Only same sex staff members
  conduct frequent checks of the detainee/inmate.

                                           Chapter 9

                            DETAINEE/INMATE TRANSFERS

9.1. Pre-Transfer Requirements. HQ AFSFC/SFC arranges transfers of all inmates within the
AFCS except those being transferred within the guidelines of HQ AFSFC/SFC coordinated and
approved MOAs. (See 1.2.2.2., 1.3.9. and 1.3.3.1.4) Normally, when the sentence retains the
inmate to be housed locally, it is a recommended the closest confinement/corrections facility be
contacted first even though it may not be within the same command.
   9.1.1. Parent units are responsible for the inmate's orders and transportation arrangements.
   9.1.2. Prior to transfer, the confinement/corrections staff conducts a pre-transfer conference
   with the inmate (reference paragraph 9.2). If approved for transfer to an RCF or higher
   facility, HQ AFSFC/ SFC provides additional instructions by Defense Message System.
   9.1.3. The inmate’s original CTF accompanies the inmate and is hand-carried by the escort.
   9.1.4. Prior to transfer, the losing commander provides documents relating to security
   clearance suspension or withdrawal for inclusion in the CTF.
   9.1.5. Ensure the parent unit commander understands inmates transferred without an
   adjudged discharge will administratively remain assigned to their unit.
   9.1.6. Prior to transfer, make all necessary victim/witness notifications and ensure all DD
   Form 2704s and 2705s are sealed in a separate envelope and placed with the CTF.
   9.1.7. At the time of transfer, medical recertification to determine fitness for confinement is
   not required, except for cause. A break in confinement for periods over 24 hours requires a
   new physical examination. Examinations may be requested for shorter periods when
   circumstances indicate cause. Inmates transferred between facilities normally do not require a
   new medical certification unless deemed appropriate by either the receiving facility or the
   inmate escort upon arrival.
       9.1.7.1. The medical officer will annotate the recertification in the health record or
       computer generated form, for inmates with confinement interruptions. Escorts will ensure
       this document is readily accessible upon arrival.
       9.1.7.2. Inmates determined by a medical officer to be mentally unstable will be
       segregated from other inmates. A medical officer will determine whether a medical
       attendant should accompany the escort. If the inmate requires special medical attention,
       transfer will be accomplished through medical channels and escorts are provided IAW
       custody requirements.
   9.1.8. Ensure VWAP and sex offender notifications have been accomplished (i.e., ensure
   DD Form 2791 was placed in the members UPRG/CTF/facility files).
9.2. The Pre-Transfer Conference. The inmate, the inmate’s commander or appointed
representative and confinement officer attend the conference to explain the purpose of the
transfer and resolve the disposition of property and funds. The confinement officer or appointee:
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                               71


   9.2.1. Schedules the conference just prior to transfer. Ensure adequate time is provided for
   the inmate to accomplish any personal actions prior to transfer. The inmate will not be
   notified of the exact date and time for transfer.
   9.2.2. Advise the inmate of dependent travel and shipping entitlements.
       9.2.2.1. There is no entitlement for single and divorced members without dependents to
       ship or store household goods and personal property at government expense.
       9.2.2.2. Inmates with authorized dependents transferring within CONUS may ship
       household goods according to JFTR paragraph U5370-J.
       9.2.2.3. Inmates coming from an overseas location (their previous assignment) may ship
       household goods to the home of record or designated place according to JFTR paragraph
       U5370-D8.
       9.2.2.4. Personal property or household goods will not accompany the inmate to the
       gaining facility.
   9.2.3. Confiscate inmate and dependent Armed Forces identification cards. Place the
   inmate’s Armed Forces identification card in the CTF prior to transfer. The inmate’s parent
   unit issues dependents new cards according to AFI 36-3026 (I), Identification Cards for
   Members of the Uniformed Services, Their Family Members and Other Eligible Personnel.
   9.2.4. The time just before transfer may be a period of emotional turmoil for the inmate,
   consideration should be given to changing the custody grade of the inmate, if warranted.
9.3. Transfer of Convicted Offenders. CAs designate confinement for court-martialed
offenders according to AFI 51-201. Inmates under USAF control usually transfer to a DoD RCF
so they can capitalize on treatment programs offered only at those facilities. In order to keep
track of all USAF inmate transfers, HQ AFSFC/SFC directs these transfers. Many situations can
be solved early if HQ AFSFC/SFC is involved especially in the trial preparation stages, in case
the result of trial is a conviction. If the confinement officer has questions contact HQ
AFSFC/SFC directly.
   9.3.1. Post-trial inmates may be transferred at the direction of HQ AFSFC/SFC to the
   appropriate level facility following their court-martial. Normally, inmates are housed in a
   Level 1 facility while pending convening authority action unless circumstances warrant
   immediate transfer or delay in transfer. Post-trial inmates in Level 1 CFs and RCFs must
   have 90-days or more confinement remaining to be transferred to an appropriate Level 2 or
   long-term facility. Deviation from these minimum time requirements must be justified in the
   transfer request and approved by HQ AFSFC/SFC. It is recommended that senior NCOs and
   officers serving sentences in a Level 1 facility be transferred to a facility other than on their
   home station.
   9.3.2. To initiate a transfer of an Air Force inmate, Security Forces shall send a transfer
   request message via Defense Message System to HQ AFSFC/SFC. To ensure coordination of
   this transfer, send a copy to the inmate’s unit, SJA, CA and MAJCOM/SF. Use the message
   format in Attachment 22 to request transfers. Justify requests for immediate or delay in
   transfer in paragraph 14. Compute clemency, parole and minimum and maximum release
   dates according to AFJI 31-215 (AR 633-30), Military Sentences to Confinement. In addition
72                                               AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


  to the message, fax a copy of the DD Form 2707, Confinement Order and AF Form 1359,
  Report of Result of Trial, to HQ AFSFC/SFC.
  9.3.3. Housing inmates in Army correctional facilities require a memorandum of agreement
  (MOA). HQ AFSFC/SFC approves all other transfers to Army facilities after coordination
  with HQ Army (DAPM-MPD-CI).
  9.3.4. When notified of a pending court-martial, where bed space in the Level 1 CF or local
  support facilities is not available, pre-coordinate a request for immediate transfer. Provisions

confinement at a Level 1 RCF or higher, the inmate’s parent unit commander provides escort
personnel consistent with custody grade and security requirements IAW paragraphs 9.5 and 8.2
The inmate’s parent unit under provisions in AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures,
paragraph 10.2.1, provides funding of escorts. The confinement officer determines custody
grade. All inmates must be escorted, regardless of status or rank. When the confinement officer

9.10. Transfer Escort Responsibilities. Escorts monitor the appearance and conduct of
inmates and will restrain inmates who become a security risk. They avoid crowds and actions
that cause public attention. Escorts and inmates will wear the appropriate uniform (normally, the
service uniform), unless otherwise authorized by the confinement officer. Escorts and inmates
will not consume alcohol during the transfer.
9.11. Appearance of Inmates as Witnesses.
   9.11.1. Civil proceedings: In legal proceedings in which the United States federal
   government does not have an interest, temporary absence of inmates from CFs and RCFs for
   appearance as witnesses requires prior approval of the confinement officer. Confinement
   officers will cooperate to the extent practicable with civil authorities in the appearance of
   inmates as witnesses in civil proceedings. There are no circumstances in which inmates can
   be released from the control of the Department of the Air Force for this purpose; therefore,
   the cost of transportation, housing and meals of inmates and accompanying escorts must be
   borne by the requesting civil authorities. A formal acknowledgment of these provisions will
   be required before approval and release of an inmate for this purpose and cleared with the
   SJA.
   9.11.2. Military proceedings: If an inmate is not housed locally and their presence is required
   as a witness in a courts-martial, request a letter from the prosecuting Judge Advocate to the
   confinement officer where the inmate is housed. The cost of transportation, housing and
   meals of the inmate and accompanying escorts will be coordinated with the requesting SJA.
   Refer to AFI 51-201, Table 6.1. for funding requirements.
   9.11.3. Request and coordinate any movement of Air Force inmates for the purposes
   mentioned in paragraphs 9.11.1 – 9.11.2 with HQ AFSFC/SFC. The temporary transfer
   request shall include the travel itinerary, escort names and fund cites to be used. Once the
   Director, Air Force Corrections approves the request forward a copy of the travel orders to
   HQ AFSFC/SFC.

   clemency reviews of Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) inmates.
   10.1.3. Parole, if requested by eligible inmates and Mandatory Supervised Release (MSR).
10.2. Considerations. A disposition board considers the inmate’s offense(s), attitude, aptitude,
adaptability to confinement, record of confinement performance, rehabilitation potential/efforts
and potential for further military service or adjustment to the civilian life. Board proceedings are
not open to the public, victims, or witnesses. When formulating a recommendation for

convene a disposition board for eligible inmates and process results to the AFC&PB (1535
Command Dr., EE Wing, 3rd Fl., Andrews AFB, MD 20762-7002), for final disposition. Forward
a copy of the complete case file to the Convening Authority and HQ AFSFC/SFC.

   10.10.7. Inmates released on parole and MSR will be considered by the AFC&PB upon
   request for clemency, restoration and reenlistment 12 months after release on parole and
   annually thereafter, until sentence expires. Inmates, who have parole or MSR revoked, are
   not normally considered for clemency until 12 months after the effective revocation date.
   10.10.8. Inmates with an approved sentence to confinement for life without the possibility of
   parole will normally be considered by the AFC&PB after the inmate has served 20 years
   confinement and at least every three years thereafter. If the AFC&PB considers clemency
   appropriate for an inmate sentenced to confinement for life without the possibility of parole,
   it will forward its recommendation to the Secretary of the Air Force for final decision. Only
   the Secretary of the Air Force may grant clemency to inmates with an approved sentence to
   confinement for life without the possibility of parole.
   10.10.9. Additional information or guidance can be found in DoDI 1325.7, Administration of
   Military Correctional Facilities and Clemency and Parole Authority.
10.11. Announcement of Clemency Results. Confinement officers promptly notify inmates of
the AFC&PB’s decision. However, before making the notification, the confinement officer
notifies the Board immediately if an inmate’s conduct has significantly changed, or if there is
other relevant information the Board should consider.
10.12. Eligibility for Parole. Unless waived in writing, the AFC&PB considers inmates for
release on parole when they first become eligible and annually thereafter. The Board or a
confinement/corrections facility commander may advance an inmate’s parole eligibility date or
 82                                               AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


order an out-of-cycle disposition board. Inmates may make special requests for advancement of
parole eligibility or an out-of-cycle disposition board to the confinement/corrections facility
commander.
   10.12.1. Unless directed otherwise by the AFC&PB, an inmate is eligible for parole when:
       10.12.1.1. The inmate has an approved unsuspended sentence to a punitive discharge or
       dismissal, an approved administrative discharge, or is either retired or approved for
       retirement; and
       10.12.1.2. The unsuspended sentence or aggregate sentence to confinement is 12 months
       or more and the inmate has served one-third of the term of confinement, but in no case
       less than 6 months; or after having served 10 years of a sentence to confinement for 30
       years or more, or after having served 20 years of a sentence to confinement for life, but
       not a sentence of confinement for life without the possibility of parole. Refer to
       Attachment 18.2., rule 6b.
   10.12.2. The AFC&PB normally does not consider inmates whose parole was revoked for
   parole violations and returned to confinement until the inmate serves 12-months confinement
   after return to confinement.
   10.12.3. An inmate with an approved sentence to death or confinement for life without the
   possibility of parole is not eligible for parole.
   10.12.4. The AFC&PB considers inmates, if otherwise eligible for parole in accordance with
   paragraph 10.12.1, with an approved sentence including confinement for 12 months or more
   and a fine with a provision for further confinement if the fine is not paid, for parole based on
   the approved sentence to confinement and without regard to that confinement made
   contingent upon failure to pay the fine.
   10.12.5. The AFC&PB considers inmates with an approved sentence including a fine with
   no confinement, but with a provision for confinement if the fine is not paid, for parole upon
   the inmate’s imprisonment for not paying the fine, if otherwise eligible, in accordance with
   paragraph 10.12.1
   10.12.6. When computing eligibility for parole date, do not factor GCT and EGCT.
   10.12.7. The AFC&PB can waive any of the above eligibility requirements, except those
   relating to inmates with an approved sentence to confinement for life without the possibility
   of parole or with an approved sentence to death.
10.13. Objectives of Parole. The objectives of parole are:
   10.13.1. Assisting the inmate through supervision and guidance in making the transition
   from a controlled environment to life in the community.
   10.13.2. Making available a focal point through which community services may contribute
   to the inmate’s positive social adjustment.
   10.13.3. Protecting the community and the inmate from stresses associated with
   unsupervised release.
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                            83


10.14. Parole/Mandatory Supervised Release Preparation Assistance. Confinement officers
appoint an individual to provide the following assistance to inmates. The appointee must have no
direct connection with the individual inmate’s prosecution.
   10.14.1. The appointee advises inmates of requirements and eligibility criteria for parole and
   mandatory supervised release (MSR). The appointee assists them in developing an acceptable
   supervision plan (either a parole plan or an inmate’s plan for MSR) and if applicable, a
   restitution plan. Lastly, upon completion of the plan, the appointee verifies the inmate’s
   plans.
   10.14.2. The appointee will interview inmates and formulate a recommendation to the
   disposition board on DD Form 2715-1. The recommendation is based on the merits of the
   inmate’s parole plan and suitability for parole., The appointee will recommend any specific
   conditions for parole; e.g., involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics
   Anonymous (NA) sessions, community-based behavioral health or substance abuse
   rehabilitation programs and urinalysis testing.
   10.14.3. If parole was approved, the appointee contacts the Parole Branch at the USDB to
   determine the US Probation Office nearest the inmate’s residence while on parole.
       10.14.3.1. The appointee contacts the designated US Probation Office to relinquish
       responsibility of the inmate.
       10.14.3.2. The appointee shall forward a copy of the inmate’s supervision plan and
       parole/MSR certificate with attachments to the designated US Probation Office to
       coordinate an inmate’s supervision plan.
10.15. Conditions for Release on Parole/MSR. The AFC&PB paroles inmates when it is
consistent with the ends of justice and as soon as inmates demonstrate they can assume the
responsibilities of productive, law-abiding citizens. Parole is not a means to manage inmate
populations. Prior to release on parole, inmates must have an approved supervision plan and
agree in writing to abide by the plan and the conditions of supervision.
   10.15.1. The inmate’s plan includes where and with whom the inmate will live.
   Additionally, it must include the full address, county or parish, telephone number and
   relationship of and written acknowledgment by the person with whom the parolee will live.
   The plan must include the names and relationships of all residents in the household and birth
   dates of all residents under the age of 18.
   10.15.2. The plan also includes employment information except in the case of a medically
   disabled inmate. The inmate can meet this requirement by presenting written proof of either
   guaranteed employment, an offer of effective assistance to obtain employment, or acceptance
   to a bona fide educational or vocational program. Employment in a family member’s
   household or an offer of employment assistance by a family member is normally not
   acceptable.
   10.15.3. If the inmate’s crime involved pecuniary (financial) loss by a victim the supervision
   plan shall address restitution IAW AFC&PB guidance.
   10.15.4. The AFC&PB establishes and subsequently modifies any conditions for release it
   considers reasonable and appropriate. The Board may also grant parole up to the expiration
   of full sentence.
 84                                              AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


10.16. Announcement of Parole Results. The AFC&PB immediately forwards its decision to
the commander of the facility housing the inmate. The commander ensures the inmate
acknowledges the appropriate section (i.e., parole approval or parole denial) and signs the DD
Form 2716, Parole Acknowledgement Letter. When the Board denies parole, its decision
includes the reason for denial. When the Board approves parole, the decision package includes
the DD Form 2716-1, Department of Defense Certificate of Parole. Before notifying the
inmate of the results, the confinement officer notifies the Board immediately if the inmate’s
conduct significantly changed or there is other relevant information that the Board should
consider.
10.17. Appeal of Parole Denial. Inmates denied parole may appeal through the commander or
designee of the facility within 30 days of receiving written notification of denial. The inmate
should submit new or additional information not previously considered. The commander or
designee verifies the accuracy of the inmate’s statement and indicates by attached statement
whether the factors justify changing the AFC&PB's decision. The commander or designee
forwards the statement, the inmate’s appeal and the board case file to AFC&PB (1535 Command
Dr., EE Wing, 3rd Fl., Andrews AFB, MD 20762-7002), for final decision by the Director, Air
Force Review Boards Agency. Inmates receive no further appeals.
10.18. Parole Processing. The confinement officer releases inmates on parole, in coordination
with the appropriate US Probation Office, as specified on the DD Form 2716-1, Department of
Defense Certificate of Parole. Misconduct by an inmate after parole approval may delay or
preclude release. If the confinement officer delays release for cause, promptly notify the
AFC&PB of the reason for delay and make a recommendation for further delays or rescission of
parole.
   10.18.1. Upon approval of parole, the Chairperson, or designee prepares DD Form 2716-1,
   Department of Defense Certificate of Parole and forwards it, with the notification of parole
   approval, to the confinement officer having custody of the inmate.
   10.18.2. Confinement officers responsible for Level 1 CFs and RCFs notify HQ
   AFSFC/SFC when releasing an inmate on parole.
       10.18.2.1. The inmate will sign all copies of the parole certificate acknowledging receipt
       and understanding of the contents. The certificate, which will serve as a release order,
       will also contain any special conditions or limits to parole.
       10.18.2.2. The confinement/corrections facility distributes the original of the DD Form
       2716-1 to the USDB Parole Office, the first copy to the inmate, the second copy to the
       designated US Probation Officer, the third copy to the AFC&PB and the fourth is placed
       in the CTF.
   10.18.3. If discharge is complete, the confinement officer gives AF Form 100, Request and
   Authorization for Separation and DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge
   From Active Duty, to the inmate before release on parole.
   10.18.4. Inmates released on parole receive the same gratuities as inmates released from
   confinement.
   10.18.5. A medical officer will give parolees a physical examination according to AFI 48-
   123, Medical Examination and Medical Standards. This physical examination will suffice for
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                               85


   the discharge physical for those inmates undergoing appellate review and not previously
   discharged.
   10.18.6. Inmates released on parole, pending completion of appellate review, or whose
   parole changes to excess leave status following completion of sentence to confinement while
   on parole, remain members of the military service and are authorized ID card privileges.
   Individuals released on parole are issued ID cards for the duration of their parole, i.e.,
   maximum release date.
   10.18.7. While an individual is on parole, HQ AFSFC/SFC will determine the parolee’s line
   of duty after suffering injury, disease, or death.
   10.18.8. Individuals released on parole are directly responsible to the assigned US Probation
   Officer and through the Commandant, USDB, to the AFC&PB.
       10.18.8.1. Normally, confinement/corrections staff or other Air Force agencies address
       all communications with the parolee to or through the US Probation Officer concerned.
       10.18.8.2. The parolee may not travel outside the parole limits without prior approval.
       The parole limits include the geographical areas in which an inmate released on parole
       will reside. Unless otherwise directed by the AFC&PB, the parolee's movement will be
       prescribed by the probation officer, who may extend or further restrict the parole limits as
       required for the adjustment and supervision of the parolee. However, the parolee must
       obtain prior approval of the AFC&PB, through the probation officer, for an absence from
       the parole limits for more than 20 days or for any travel outside of the United States. The
       probation officer should advise the AFC&PB through the USDB parole office of any
       such requests.
   10.18.9. Upon receipt of parole approval from AFC&PB, the confinement/corrections staff
   will contact the servicing MPF of the inmate concerned and provide them a copy of the letter
   approving parole. HQ AFSFC/SFC provides specific actions for completing PCS orders and
   for releasing the inmate. The prepared DD Form 2716-1, Department of Defense
   Certificate of Parole serves as the release order. DO NOT complete DD Form 2718,
   Inmate's Release Order. Upon release on parole, the confinement officer ensures the
   original correction records, as well as copies of all documents about the parole approval and
   subsequent release are forwarded to the USDB Parole Branch. Ensure all VWAP and Sex
   Offender notifications/registration, if applicable, have been made prior to release. Reference
   paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 All parolees are reassigned to HQ AFSFC/SFC.
   10.18.10. The AFC&PB considers parolees for clemency. The clemency review package
   must include the assigned US Probation Officer’s report on the parolee’s adjustment.
10.19. Termination of Parole. Expiration of the term of confinement ends parole.
   10.19.1. If a parolee's punitive discharge has been executed or the parolee is eligible to retire
   at the end of the parolee’s service of confinement, then at the completion of the full term of
   confinement, the parolee will be released from supervision.
   10.19.2. If the parolee’s sentence expires before appellate review is complete and before
   execution of a discharge or retirement, the GCMCA may place the parolee on excess leave.
 86                                               AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


   10.19.3. Upon completion of the above paragraphs, the Parole Office at the USDB prepares
   and distributes DA Form 1708-R, Certificate of Release from Parole, according to USDB
   procedures.
   10.19.4. When the AFC&PB authorizes assignment of a parolee to the RTDP, the
   Commandant, USDB, returns the parolee to military custody. Transportation costs incident to
   return to military custody under these conditions are borne by the government.
10.20. Suspension of Parole. When the Commandant, USDB, receives information that the
parolee may have violated one or more conditions of parole, the Commandant forwards this
information immediately to the Board. The Chairperson, or designee, determines whether to
suspend parole. If considered necessary to assure the presence of the parolee, pending a
determination of the parolee’s status, or when the parolee presents a substantial threat to public
safety, the Chairperson or designee may direct the parolee be taken into custody. The
Chairperson or designee advises the AFC&PB of the action taken as soon as possible.
Transportation costs incident to return to military custody under these conditions will be borne
by the government.
10.21. Revocation of Parole. The AFC&PB, revokes parole according to standards and
procedures in DoDI 1325.7.
   10.21.1. The AFC&PB will consider the findings and recommendations of the officer or
   panel conducting the parole violation hearing. The AFC&PB makes a decision to revoke
   parole based on the preponderance of the evidence that the parolee violated a condition of
   parole and that the violation warrants parole revocation. In determining whether the violation
   warrants revocation of parole, the Board should consider the factors set forth in paragraph
   10.9 as well as the impact the revocation will have on the parolee and the parolee’s family.
   10.21.2. After conducting a parole violation hearing, the officer or panel immediately
   forwards a summary of the proceedings to the AFC&PB. If the AFC&PB revokes parole and
   does not immediately reparole the parolee and the parolee is confined in a civilian institution,
   the AFC&PB initiates action to lodge a detainer with civilian authorities. If the parolee is at
   large in the district of the violation, pending decision on revocation, the AFC&PB initiates
   action to return the parolee to military control.
   10.21.3. When the AFC&PB suspends or revokes parole, the Board may order a warrant for
   the parolee’s return to custody. The AFC&PB furnishes a copy of its decision to order a
   warrant to the Commandant, USDB, and in the case of parole revocation, furnishes an
   information copy to HQ AFSFC/SFC and AFLSA/JAJM. Rules on apprehension and return
   to military control of escaped inmates apply. When a parole violator is located in the custody
   of civil authorities, the USDB will place a detainer with civil authorities for return of the
   inmate to military control. The nearest Air Force Installation Security Forces will be
   responsible for returning Air Force parole violators to military control for the completion of
   any remaining period of confinement.
   10.21.4. Upon the direction of the Chairperson, or designee, ordering a warrant, the USDB
   parole office completes FBI Form I-12 on a parolee whose apprehension or location is
   desired. Check the ―wanted for‖ box and give the reason for the notice. Completing the form
   does not mean the FBI will initiate arrest. They will merely notify the Commandant, USDB,
   of arrests coming to the attention of the FBI Identification Division. The USDB parole office
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                            87


   will cancel the ―Wanted‖ notice by completing the applicable portion of the FBI Form I-12
   and forwarding it directly to the FBI.
10.22. Mandatory Supervised Release (MSR) Eligibility of Inmates Not
Paroled. Mandatory supervision only applies to inmates, whose approved finding of guilty
included at least one offense that occurred on or after August 16, 2001. The AFC&PB will
normally place the following inmates, who are not paroled, under supervised release on their
minimum release dates: an inmate convicted of a violent offense or a sex offense (see sex offense
list at Enclosure 27, DoDI 1325.7), if they have an approved sentence to confinement of 12
months or greater; an inmate with an approved sentence to confinement of 3 years or greater; and
other inmates deemed appropriate for mandatory supervision by the confinement/ corrections
facility commander and the AFC&PB. The Board’s decision is final. Inmates placed on
mandatory supervised release shall be deemed as if on parole until the expiration of their
sentence to confinement. The AFC&PB will provide corrections staff with guidance on
implementing the procedures detailed in DoDI 1325.7, paragraph 6.20. The AFC&PB considers
inmates released on MSR for clemency 12 months after release and annually thereafter until the
sentence expires. If the supervisee is ordered returned to a correctional facility, the HQ
AFSFC/SFC shall determine the location.
10.23. Emergency Parole (EP). Confinement officers can authorize EP for inmates in extreme
emergency circumstances. An extreme circumstance is normally one in which the physical
presence of the inmate is considered necessary to save the life of another, e.g., an organ
donation/bone marrow donation. The death(s) of an inmate’s family member(s), or the birth of a
child(ren), for example, are not normally considered extreme circumstances. Confinement
officers authorize EP for as long as deemed necessary, but normally should not exceed seven
days or a period considered medically necessary. Inmates return to confinement after EP.
Verify the emergency with agencies such as the American Red Cross, or by direct consultation
with medical professionals requesting the inmate’s presence. Ensure actions are consistent with
correctional requirements and public safety. Notifications of victims and witnesses participating
in the VWAP will be made by the most direct means prior to release on EP. Telephonic
notification will be confirmed by written notification. The US Government must not incur
financial responsibility for any inmate expenses during an EP situation. Travel and subsistence
expenses of any guards/escorts determined by the confinement officer to be necessary will be
borne by the inmate’s parent unit.

                                          Chapter 11

  REHABILITATION SERVICES AND AIR FORCE RETURN TO DUTY PROGRAM

11.1. Required Programs. All able-bodied inmates will participate in work assignments, adult
basic education (as needed), correctional treatment, physical training and be afforded the
opportunity to participate in correctional treatment programs.
   11.1.1. Work Programs. Confinement officers set up local inmate work programs so they are
   consistent with custody level and civilian employment potential. Inmates should perform
   duties or services that contribute to Air Force mission, as well as inmate's rehabilitation. Use
   AF Form 512, Inmate Utilization, to record the work assignments and DD Form 2712,
   Inmate Work and Training Report, or equivalent form to evaluate the performance.
   11.1.2. The confinement officer assigns post-trial inmates to tasks duty airmen may perform.
   When assigning work to inmates, confinement/corrections staff:
       11.1.2.1. Must not assign pre-trial detainees work as disciplinary action. They will
       perform house-cleaning tasks with post-trial inmates in their cell, bay, or dormitory. They
       may volunteer, in writing, for work assignments commensurate with their grade. An
       inmate is considered in on-duty status, except for periods of mandatory sleep, meals and
       during periods of voluntary religious observations, as determined by the confinement
       officer in coordination with the installation chaplain.
       11.1.2.2. Shall assign officer inmates to clean their assigned living quarters area
       including common areas. Pre-trial officer detainees may request, in writing, other work
       assignments, which are approved by the installation CSF. Post-trial officer inmates will
       work as assigned by the installation CSF.
       11.1.2.3. During normal duty hours, inmates should work in a work outlet commensurate
       with their custody grade. When possible, assignments should focus on obtaining and
       learning a skill the inmate may use upon discharge from the Air Force. This does not
       preclude periodically assigning inmates to details such as base litter patrol. When the
       CSF approves, inmates in minimum or community custody grades may work within their
       Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). Inmates with special skills (for example, mechanic,
       electrician and carpenter) should receive work assignments to put their skill to productive
       use. Brief escorts and work outlet supervisors on escort procedures and restrictions to
       inmate employment. Refer to paragraph 8.2 Document the initial briefing.
       11.1.2.4. While an inmate is in confinement, use AF Form 511, Individual Inmate
       Utilization, to record inmate work program participation, training and other utilization
       information and document the initial briefing. Use DD Form 2712, Inmate Work and
       Training Evaluation, to document performance.
   11.1.3. Prohibit the following types of inmate employment:
       11.1.3.1. Operating a vehicle.
       11.1.3.2. Handling classified material, medical or behavioral health records, personal or
       official mail, personal property, funds, or sensitive files.
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                             89


      11.1.3.3. Working with hazardous materials, such as access to drugs, narcotics,
      intoxicants, firearms, or munitions.
      11.1.3.4. Providing personal services or working in an authoritative capacity over
      another individual.
      11.1.3.5. Labor inherently more hazardous than that required of active duty personnel,
      which violates civilian labor contracts, or under the supervision of a non-DoD foreign
      national.
      11.1.3.6. Food service, unless in a correction dining facility.
      11.1.3.7. Labor that permits close association with the opposite sex, unless closely
      supervised.
      11.1.3.8. Labor that may bring financial gain to inmates or the confinement/corrections
      staff, may bring criticism to the US military, or violate Air Force standards of conduct.
      11.1.3.9. Performing work details outside the facility on Sundays and federal holidays
      unless the inmate(s) volunteer in writing. Non-Christian inmates, who practice their
      religion and non-religious individuals, will share in the Sunday and federal holiday
      exception, or will be reasonably accommodated when practical.
11.2. Correctional Treatment Programs. Correctional treatment programs are equal in
importance to work assignments.
   11.2.1. Confinement officers ensure programs include:
      11.2.1.1. Crisis intervention and corrections counseling.
      11.2.1.2. Drug and alcohol counseling.
      11.2.1.3. Self-growth groups (such as AA and NA).
      11.2.1.4. Religious programs (in-facility programs also, if possible).
      11.2.1.5. Pre-release counseling, including preparation of parole plans, if the inmate will
      be parole eligible.
      11.2.1.6. Facilities without treatment programs must provide access to crisis
      intervention, drug/ alcohol counseling and pre-release counseling.
      11.2.1.7. Academic Instruction. Courses are offered for general education, allowing the
      inmate without a high school diploma to attain a GED. Those with serious reading and/or
      writing deficiencies will be offered the opportunity to pursue Air Force sponsored, if
      locally available, remedial training. Adult basic education is designed to contribute to the
      inmates' social adjustment.
   11.2.2. Confinement/corrections staff refers inmates to base level specialty certified services
   (i.e., behavioral (Life Skills) health, ADAPT, education center, chapel, etc.) or other
   approved personnel for appropriate services.
   11.2.3. If AA and NA are unavailable on base, the confinement officer will attempt to
   arrange AA and NA visits to the facility, if needed.
   11.2.4. Religious programs. Inmates will be permitted to worship and participate in religious
   activities according to their faiths, subject to their particular custody and control
 90                                               AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


   requirements. They are not, however, required to attend religious meetings or services. If
   inmates are to attend religious services in an installation chapel in which other military
   personnel may be present, they shall be permitted to wear the appropriate service uniform. If
   escorts are required in this situation, they should be as unobtrusive as possible in maintaining
   custody and control. When manning is an issue, confinement NCOs will request parent unit
   support (escorts) if custody grade permits, reference paragraph 1.3.10
11.3. Training, Treatment and Transition Program (TTTP). Confinement/corrections staff
will ensure HQ AFSFC/SFC TTTP materials, identified in the TTTP Resource Guide, are made
available to inmates who voluntarily elect to participate. The TTTP Resource Guide is available
on the corrections website at https://wwwmil.lackland.af.mil/afsf. TTTP is designed to provide
information and resources to the correctional staff in Level 1 CFs and RCFs to assist in an
inmate’s rehabilitation and successful transition back to the community. Corrections staff will
not act as Life Skills counselors.
   11.3.1. Use DD Form 2712, Inmate Work and Training Evaluation, or locally generated
   form, to document weekly progress and to determine an inmate’s eligibility for Extra Good
   Conduct Time (EGCT). EGCT will be awarded at the rate of up to 3 days a month consistent
   with participation in earned time programs (refer to DoDI 1325.7., E26.3.). Confinement
   officers will determine the amount EGCT awarded.
   11.3.2. When completing the DD Form 2712, for TTTP evaluation, the purpose is ―other‖.
   In Section 1, Attitude & Traits, complete ―Initiative‖ and ―Interest in Facility Treatment
   Program‖ on a weekly basis. All other areas pertain to the inmate’s general conduct while
   confined. Section 2, Work Performance, will not be used for TTTP evaluation, but can be
   completed for participation in work assignments and combined with TTTP and general
   conduct evaluations.
11.4. Adult Basic Education/Academic Instruction. Inmates should be encouraged to further
their civilian and military education by participating in base level programs, pursuing self-study
courses and enrolling in various correspondence courses. Allow inmate’s without a high school
diploma to attain a GED, as needed. Those with serious reading and/or writing deficiencies will
be offered the opportunity to pursue Air Force sponsored, if locally available, remedial training.
Adult basic education is designed to contribute to the inmates' social adjustment.
11.5. Physical Training/Exercise and Recreation. Experience indicates the majority of
facility disorders are planned or instigated during inmates’ un-programmed time. It is with this in
mind that the facility must provide, as an integral part of the correctional treatment program,
recreational and welfare activities that are intended to constructively occupy the inmate’s leisure
time and fill the gaps between details, training and administrative activities that comprise the
schedule. One of the essential elements of successful correctional treatment is the provision for
inmate free time. Recreational activities also and help relieve stress brought on by living in
confinement.
   11.5.1. Confinement officers ensure inmates receive at least one hour of physical training,
   three times a week. They also provide recreational activities such as library, table games,
   television and radio. For inmate safety, security and possible access to contraband, the
   confinement/corrections staff closely supervises team sports and individual activities.
   Facilities that do not have their own recreation yards must coordinate with the services

   according to custody grades.
   11.5.2. Inmate Recreation. Inmates should participate in recreational activities. They may
   participate in individual or team activities directed at enabling the inmate to attain physical
   fitness and keep them active. These type activities are effective in preventing periods of
   idleness and boredom among the population.
   11.5.3. Recreation Rooms. Each correctional facility should have a recreation room where
   inmates have access to inside recreational equipment, particularly in the evenings and on
   holidays. The room should be separate from the dayroom/television area.
   11.5.4. Dayroom and Television Area. Furnishings for the area should be comparable to
   those in squadron dayrooms. Television and/or radios should be available. Tables and chairs
   for table games and an area where inmates can engage in hobbies (painting, leatherwork and
   other kit-type hobbies) should be available. Inmates may view video movies, when approved,
   in this area. The staff will monitor the types of movies inmates view.
   11.5.5. Inmate Recreational Reading Area. All reading material will be screened and
   approved prior to introduction into the facility. NOTE: Inmates in pay status shall be
   allowed to purchase approved reading material (i.e., hometown newspaper, local newspaper
   or magazines) with their personal funds. Commercial reading material must arrive in the mail
   from the publisher/supplier (not from an individual) or be purchased directly from a vendor,
   such as the Base Exchange.

     are returned to duty that if they complete their enlistments honorably but face HYT
     issues, they may petition the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records for
     relief.
     11.6.11.5. (NEW) . Mandatory EPR Statement. In the first EPR after graduation from
     the RTDP the following statement must be included in the Rater’s comments,
     ―Successfully completed AF Return-to-Duty Program and was returned to duty by order
     of the SECAF‖.
  11.6.12. Elimination from Program:
     11.6.12.1. (REPLACE) . Elimination for Cause. After consultation with the Evaluation
     and Treatment Team, the Director, Air Force Corrections may eliminate candidates from
     the program for cause (unsatisfactory behavior, progress, etc.). A candidate notified of
     elimination from the program has 24-hours to indicate an intention to appeal the decision.
     Within 3-days of the elimination notice, such a candidate shall submit the appeal with the
     comments, supporting material and attachments as candidate deems necessary through
     the Director, Air Force Corrections, to the AFC&PB. Defense counsel(s) may assist in
     the preparation of the letter. The Director, Air Force Corrections will also prepare
     documents detailing the reason for elimination from the program including the evaluation
     and treatment team recommendation for the AFC&PB. Upon receipt of the documents
     from the candidate and Director, Air Force Corrections, the AFC&PB shall immediately
     determine the issue by majority vote. In all RTDP votes before the AFC&PB, the
     Director, Air Force Corrections shall be considered a voting member, except elimination
     appeal considerations to prevent any potential conflict of interest. When the Director, Air
     Force Corrections has a potential conflict of interest, the Director, Secretary of the Air
     Force Personnel Council (SAFPC), shall designate an alternate member of the AFC&PB,
     such as the Deputy Director SAFPC or similar position, to vote on elimination appeal
     cases as a ―proxy‖. In elimination appeal cases, the AFC&PB decision will solely be to
     eliminate or to retain in the program. There is no appeal from the AFC&PB decisions.
     11.6.12.2. (REPLACE) . Self-Elimination. A candidate may quit the RTDP at any time
     by revoking their volunteer statement after consulting with a legal representative. The
     candidate will have a 24-hour "cooling off" period to allow time to consider the
     ramifications of their decision. The candidate may use the period to consult with a social
     worker, chaplain or reasonable number of family members. A candidate can only use the
     cooling-off period once while in the RTDP, therefore, any subsequent revocation of their
     volunteer status will result in immediate elimination from the program. The Director, Air
     Force Corrections then removes the candidate from the program and takes the appropriate
     action depending on the individual case and the circumstances (usually to release or
     return to command/confinement).
     11.6.12.3. Disposition of eliminated candidates:
        11.6.12.3.1. If past MRD and sentenced to a punitive discharge, HQ AFSFC/SFC

  with a remaining confinement sentence, the VWAP Coordinator ensures all necessary
  notifications take place whenever a candidate is allowed movement outside the facility in
  accordance with applicable VWAP instructions. For candidates who complete their sentence
  to confinement while in the RTDP, AFSFC/SFC will notify the parent unit installation

AF Level 1


Note: These characteristics are used only as guidelines. To determine the proper initial custody
level assignment the classifications committee (including life skills and security staff) should
base their decisions on documented behavior (pre and post incarceration). Subsequently, during
incarceration, inmates may have custody levels increased or decreased based on behavior.

            Re: (ACCUSED’S NAME)

Dear (NAME),

1. We have received your request for enrollment into the Victim and Witness Notification
Program. The impact of crime is devastating to innocent victims, witnesses and their families.
We will make every effort to be responsive and sensitive to your request. We will notify you,
using the attached form (Victim/Witness Notification of Inmate Status – DD Form 2705) of
pending release or release-related activities of the above-named individual. This includes
notification of initial parole and clemency eligibility dates, clemency and parole hearing dates (if
eligible), transfer to another confinement/corrections facility and temporary releases (i.e.,
emergency parole, etc.). Some inmates earn a portion off their sentence for good behavior. This
is referred to as ―earned good conduct time‖ and, if earned, will affect the release date.

2. The date an inmate is eligible for a parole hearing is mandated by Department of Defense
policy and indicates only that a hearing will be held. You will be advised prior to the inmate
appearing before the service Clemency and Parole Board. This will provide you with an
opportunity, if you desire, to submit an impact statement to that Board.

3. We intend that your request for notification remain confidential. If this inmate learns through
other means that you have made this request, or threatens or attempts to intimidate you in any
manner, notify this office immediately. To continue to receive notification of status changes, it is
important that you keep us informed of any changes in your address or telephone number.
Should you decide to remove yourself from the program, submit a written request to the Service
Central Repository, (HQ AFSFC/SFC) 1517 Billy Mitchell Boulevard, Lackland AFB, Texas
78236. Also, your request may be canceled if you do not respond within 60 days to any
subsequent inquiries pertaining to this notification.

4. If you have any question or concerns, or would like more information, you can reach your
victim and witness monitor at (NAME), at (COMM TELEPHONE).

                                                             Sincerely,

                         GUIDANCE ON DNA FINGERPRINTING

A16.1. HQ AFSFC/SFC Responsibilities:
   A16.1.1. Maintain a supply of USACIL collection kits that may be expeditiously dispatched
   to Air Force commanders, RCFs or CFs in immediate need of kits.
   A16.1.2. Maintain copies of all initial promulgating orders containing an annotation that
   DNA processing is required, regardless of where or if the member is confined.
   A16.1.3. When requested, assist USACIL in reconciling why a DNA sample for a particular
   Air Force member has not been received at the lab for analysis (i.e., in cases where USACIL
   has received an annotated initial promulgating order reflecting conviction of a "qualifying
   military offense" but no corresponding sample). This includes contacting the facility at which
   the member is confined and ascertaining the status of the DNA collection requirement. If the
   member is not in confinement at the time the request is received, this will require contacting
   the convening authority's staff judge advocate for assistance in ascertaining the status of the
   DNA collection requirement.
   A16.1.4. Assist USDB in answering questions about "qualifying military offenses" involving
   Air Force members.
A16.2. Air Force Correctional Facility Responsibilities:
   A16.2.1. Designated Air Force CFs and RCFs (5 beds or more) are required to maintain
   USACIL collection kits. Maintain current address, phone number and POC and notify
   USACIL of changes.
   A16.2.2. Determine if any inmates confined at their facilities on or after 19 June 2001,
   regardless of service affiliation, have a conviction of a "qualifying military offense" for
   which initial action has been taken by the convening authority. Ascertain the existence of a
   "qualifying military offense" by examining the initial court-martial promulgating orders
   published for each inmate. DNA samples are not collected upon conviction of a qualifying
   offense, but upon convening authority action approving the member’s sentence.
       A16.2.2.1. Promulgating orders published on and after 19 Jun 01 will annotate in bold
       print at the top of the first page if the inmate has been convicted of a "qualifying military
       offense": "DNA processing required. 10 U.S.C. §1565."
       A16.2.2.2. Promulgating orders published prior to 19 Jun 01 will not be annotated.
       Examine such promulgating orders for each inmate to ascertain the existence of
       convictions for "qualifying military offenses," which are listed on Attachment 15. When
       in doubt, consult with your local SJA.
   A16.2.3. For each inmate identified pursuant to paragraph A16.2.1 with a conviction of a
   "qualifying military offense," ensure a DNA sample is promptly collected and sent to
   USACIL. Use USACIL DNA collection kits, including the instructions contained in these
   kits, for processing DNA collection. If an inmate refuses to cooperate in providing a DNA
   sample, contact HQ AFSFC/SFC for guidance.
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                         147


  A16.2.4. Document DNA processing in each inmate's confinement records. If an inmate is
  subsequently transferred to another correctional facility after a DNA sample has been sent to
  USACIL, ensure paperwork reflecting DNA processing is included with the other
  documentation provided to the gaining correctional facility. If the inmate is transferred to
  another correctional facility before a required DNA sample can be obtained, notify the
  receiving facility that DNA processing requirements must still be accomplished for the
  transferred inmate.
  A16.2.5. If an inmate identified pursuant to paragraph A16.2.1 must be released from
  confinement before collection of a DNA sample is possible (i.e., USACIL kits are
  unavailable), immediately notify SJA of the convening authority. The SJA will notify
  appropriate agencies to ensure DNA processing is accomplished.
  A16.2.6. If designated by HQ AFSFC/SFC, pursuant to paragraph A16.2.1, as a facility
  required to maintain USACIL collections kits, ensure an adequate supply. This includes
  monitoring kit expiration dates. When supplies are low, request additional kits from
  USACIL.
     A16.2.6.1. If not designated to maintain USACIL collection kits, obtain kits when
     needed from HQ AFSFC/SFC or from another Air Force confinement/correctional
     facility.
     A16.2.6.2. A list of these facilities is provided in Attachment 17.
  A16.2.7. When members did not receive confinement or are no longer in confinement
  provide full assistance to commanders who are responsible for ensuring a DNA sample is
  collected, when the initial promulgating order is published. Assist such commanders
  regardless of service affiliation. This includes completing items 1 - 6 and 8 on the USACIL
  collection card, witnessing local medical personnel draw the blood and complete item 7 on
  the USACIL collection card and mailing the DNA sample to USACIL.
     A16.2.7.1. For installations that do not operate a correctional facility, SF personnel
     should assist local commanders in fulfilling their DNA processing responsibilities,
     including assistance as described in paragraph A16.2.6 above.
     A16.2.7.2. Coordinate with SJA and owning commanders to develop procedures to deal
     with inmates on appellate leave who refused to comply with requirements following
     notification.

NOTES:
1. Inmates with sentences of less than 12 months may request clemency consideration in writing
to the GCMCA/SPCMCA. (See AFI 51-201, paragraphs 11.17 and 11.19.)

2. "Discharge" as used in this schedule includes an approved unsuspended punitive discharge,
dismissal, administrative discharge, or retirement. An individual must have one of these to be
parole eligible.
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                             153


3. Schedule inmates who reach or surpass their initial clemency and/or parole eligibility dates
for a disposition board as soon as possible but not later than 30 days after completion of CA
action. If an inmate transfers while a disposition board is due, but before a disposition board
convenes, the new facility staff convenes a disposition board at the new facility within 30 days.

4. For this purpose, a sentence to confinement includes all confinement (for example, pre-trial or
credit for illegal pre-trial confinement) and excludes any inoperative time (for example,
deferment of sentence).

5. If you are unable to meet the requirements of column ―C‖, submit a letter of explanation to
SAFPC prior to the clemency/parole eligibility date.

6. If a parole eligibility date is within 120 days of the clemency disposition board, consider
inmates for parole.

7. The AFC&PB will not normally consider an inmate with an approved sentence to confinement
for life without the possibility of parole until the inmate has served 20 years confinement. If the
AFC&PB considers clemency appropriate for an inmate sentence to confinement for life without
the possibility of parole, it will forward its recommendation to the Secretary of the Air Force for
final decision. Only the Secretary of the Air Force may grant clemency to the inmates with an
approved sentence to confinement for life without the possibility of parole.

8. An inmate returned to military control as a parole violator will be considered for parole,
clemency, restoration and reenlistment 12 months after return to military control and annually
thereafter upon request.

9. For provisions regarding inmates with fines and confinement, or contingent confinement, see
DoDI 1325.7, paragraph 6.17.3 and 4 (Jul 17, 2001).

10. An inmate considered for parole may also be considered for clemency and upon request,
restoration to duty or reenlistment.

11. Inmates sentenced to confinement for life without parole may, for cause, be granted special
consideration for clemency, restoration, or reenlistment by the AFC&PB.

12. The SAF may direct the AFC&PB consider those cases when the approved sentence includes
a punitive discharge or dismissal, see DoDI 1325.7, paragraph 6.16.6.1 (Jul 21, 2001).

                                  MARRIAGE OF INMATES

A24.1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE. Provide confinement/corrections facilities guidelines for the
marriages of inmates. The CSF shall approve an inmate's request to marry except where a legal
restriction to the marriage exists, or where the proposed marriage presents a threat to the security
or good order of the facility, or to the protection of the public. The CSF may approve the use of
the facility for the marriage ceremony. If a marriage ceremony poses a threat to the security or
good order of the facility, the CSF may disapprove a marriage ceremony in the facility, but will
seek SJA guidance for an alternate means (i.e., most states recognize a marriage ceremony
performed over speaker phones or a proxy marriage via affidavit of absent applicant for marriage
license).
A24.2. PROGRAM OBJECTIVE. The expected result of this program: Inmate marriages will be
requested, approved and conducted in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
A24.3. PRE-TRIAL AND OR DETAINEE PROCEDURES. Procedures specified in this
Program Statement apply to all Air Force pretrial, detainee and designated inmates. U.S.
Marshals' holdovers and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) temporarily housed in
Air Force custody shall be referred to those agencies for marriage consideration.
A24.4. AUTHORITY TO APPROVE A MARRIAGE. The CSF may approve the marriage of
an Air Force inmate confined in an Air Force facility. This authority may not be delegated below
the level of Acting CSF.
A24.5. ELIGIBILITY TO MARRY. An inmate's request to marry shall be approved provided:
   A24.5.1. The inmate (and intended spouse) is legally eligible to marry. If overseas, some
   countries require citizenship of that country;
   A24.5.2. The inmate is mentally competent;
   A24.5.3. The intended spouse has verified, ordinarily in writing, an intention to marry the
   inmate; and
   A24.5.4. The marriage poses no threat to facility security or good order, or to the protection
   of the public. For example, staff shall review the marriage request of all inmates. This
   scrutiny is to ensure the request is not made to circumvent existing visiting policy, thereby
   posing a threat to facility security or good order.
A24.6. APPLICATION TO MARRY.
   A24.6.1. An Air Force inmate confined in an Air Force confinement/corrections facility who
   wants to get married shall submit a DD Form 510, requesting to marry to the confinement
   NCO. Requirements will vary by facility according to country (international) or State law.
   Obtain the requirements from the nearest city courthouse or foreign consulate. The
   confinement NCO will evaluate the request based on the criteria identified in paragraph 7.
   The confinement NCO will submit a written report of the findings and make a
   recommendation to the CSF for a final decision. Seek SJA assistance if there is a question
   about the age of the intended spouse. The intended spouse must obtain the needed
   documents.
AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                             163


     A24.6.1.1. Information on the inmate's legal eligibility to marry is determined through
     conversation with the inmate and by reviewing the Inmate Correction Treatment File
     (CTF). Indication of a present or prior marriage, including a common-law marriage,
     requires written verification that the marriage is legally dissolved. The status of a
     common-law marriage and its dissolution, are determined under the law of the state
     where the marriage occurred. Questions on an inmate's legal eligibility to marry shall be
     referred to the SJA.
     A24.6.1.2. Information on an inmate's mental competence may be obtained by reviewing
     behavioral health reports prepared on the inmate prior to and/or during the present period
     of confinement. A mental competency examination should not be conducted specifically
     to determine the inmate's mental competence to marry.
     A24.6.1.3. The confinement NCO should contact and request a written statement from
     the intended spouse, to verify that party's interest in marrying the inmate. If requested, the
     staff member may reveal public record information from the inmate's file, but this contact
     shall not include a specific discussion of the inmate's personal history, or suitability for
     marriage. An intended spouse who requests this information shall be advised to discuss
     these issues with the inmate, or, if preferred, to write the ADC.
     A24.6.1.4. The confinement NCO shall assess whether the marriage poses a threat to
     facility security or good order, or to public protection. As part of their review, the
     confinement NCO shall consult with the confinement officer for his or her assessment.
  A24.6.2. The CSF will notify the inmate in writing whether the inmate's request to marry is
  approved or disapproved. A copy of this notification shall be placed in the inmate's CTF.
  When the CSFs decision is to disapprove the inmate's request, the notification to the inmate
  shall include a statement of reason(s) for that action. The CSF shall advise the inmate that the
  decision may be appealed to the installation commander.
A24.7. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.
  A24.7.1. Detainers and Pending Charges. Staff review of a marriage request from an inmate
  who has a detainer and/or a pending charge, shall include an assessment by the SJA for the
  legal effects of the marriage on these actions. For example, an inmate could request to marry
  a potential witness in litigation pending against that inmate. Approving this marriage could
  affect the status of this litigation.
  A24.7.2. Pretrial Inmates. A pretrial inmate may request permission to marry in accordance
  with the provisions of this rule. Staff shall contact the court, U.S. Attorney and in the case of
  an alien, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to advise of the marriage request of the
  pre-trial inmate and to request their comments. Comments received should be specifically
  mentioned and considered, in the confinement NCOs report to the CSF.
  A24.7.3. Federal Inmates Not in Federal Facilities. An AF inmate who is not confined in a
  federal facility who wants to get married shall submit a request to the appropriate installation
  confinement NCO. Prior to making a decision on the inmate's request, the confinement NCO
  shall advise the confining authority of the inmate's request and ask that information on the
  criteria identified in paragraph A24.6, be furnished.
A24.8. MARRIAGE CEREMONY IN THE FACILITY.
 164                                               AFI31-205_AFMCSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


   A24.8.1. The CSF may approve the use of the facility for a short simple marriage ceremony.
   If a marriage ceremony poses a threat to the security or good order of the facility, the CSF
   may disapprove a marriage ceremony in the facility. The CSF may not delegate the authority
   to approve or to disapprove a marriage ceremony in the facility below the level of Acting
   CSF. A marriage ceremony in the facility shall not be denied because it may inconvenience
   the facility. Ordinarily, if there is concern about facility security or good order, the matter can
   be resolved by controlling the place, time and number of participants for the ceremony, or by
   placing conditions or restrictions on the ceremony. When the CSF approves an inmate's
   application to marry, but denies the use of facility for the marriage ceremony, the CSF shall
   document the reasons for this disapproval and consult the SJA for other options (i.e., conduct
   the ceremony over speakerphones or conduct the marriage by proxy via a completed affidavit
   of absent applicant for marriage license).
   A24.8.2. Expenses for a marriage ceremony in the facility shall be paid by the inmate, the
   inmate's intended spouse, the inmate's family, or other appropriate source must be
   determined in advance and approved by the CSF. The method of payment will be in a money
   order. The CSF may not permit appropriated funds to be used for the marriage ceremony.
   Upon request of the inmate, military Chaplain (clergy); a justice of the peace; an officiate
   may be authorized to assist in a marriage ceremony at the facility.
       A24.8.2.1. The marriage ceremony may be performed by any military chaplain,
       community clergy, or by a justice of the peace. The facility chaplain must confirm that a
       community person requested to perform the marriage ceremony is either a member of the
       clergy or a justice of the peace.
       A24.8.2.2. Because of ecclesiastical constraints, chaplains may decline to perform the
       marriage ceremony. Upon request of the inmate, the chaplain will assist the inmate in
       preparing for an approved marriage; for example, by providing, or arranging for an
       inmate to receive, prenuptial marriage counseling.
   A24.8.3. The CSF shall require that the marriage ceremony be a short private ceremony
   conducted without media publicity and without a best man or bride’s maids. There will not
   be visiting time between the couple after the ceremony unless a situation, i.e., sign legal
   documents, warrants approval from the CSF. The CSF shall notify the appropriate MAJCOM
   and HQ AFSFC/SFC of the proposed marriage of an inmate whose marriage might attract
   national attention, or significant local or regional attention.
A24.9. FACILITY SUPPLEMENT. Each CSF shall develop a facility Supplement establishing
local procedures to implement this Program Statement. It should include, but not be limited to,
information on the local marriage laws and processing procedures (for example, marriage license
requirements, blood tests). Also note the military members responsibility to complete all
requirements in arranging for the military identification card and DEERS and Tri-Care
enrollment.
