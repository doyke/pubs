Qualification/Instrument (QUAL/INSTM) evaluations in the simulator, and adds Attachment 1,
Glossary of References and Supporting Information.
1.1. General. This chapter provides flight examiners and aircrew members with local evaluation
criteria for the conduct of flight evaluations.
1.2. Applicability. This supplement is applicable to all assigned and attached 6th Air Mobility
Wing (6 AMW) and 927th Air Refueling Wing (927 ARW) aircrew members. This supplement
is incomplete without AFI 11-2KC-135, Volume 2, and any higher headquarters (HHQ)
supplements.
1.2.1. (MacDill Added) Purpose. This supplement augments the evaluation processes of the 6
AMW/927 ARW Standardization/Evaluation Division. It describes local evaluation criteria used
in the administration of the Stan/Eval program and for local use by aircrew members. The
attachments to this chapter are intended to simplify the qualification and mission areas/sub-areas
of AFI 11-2KC-135, Volume 2, in a quick reference chart format with 6 AMW/927 ARW
objectives.
1.9. Evaluation Requirements. Table 1.1. defines ground requisites for each type of evaluation.
The individual aircrew member bears the ultimate responsibility for ensuring ground requisites
and flight evaluations occur within their eligibility zone.

1.9.5.1. (Added) SPOT evaluations. Evaluators may join the crew to commence a No-Notice
(N/N) SPOT evaluation at any time and will be responsible for ensuring compliance with all
their go/no-go items.
AFI11-2KC-135V2_MACDILLAFBSUP 6 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                      3


1.13.1. (Added) Evaluators should coordinate with OGV prior to awarding a grade less than Q-
1. Aircrew members will not discuss events that transpired during an evaluation until the
evaluation is formally debriefed.
1.16.2. (Added) General Information. Pilot and Boom Operator checkrides should be given
using 3P procedures. Aircraft Commander/Pilot Initial Qualification (PIQ) and Instructor pilot
checkrides can be administered in either seat. However, Aircraft Commanders/PIQs must
complete an instrument approach and landing from each seat. PIQs should attempt to align
INSTM/QUAL and mission (MSN) evaluations during the first checkride cycle after returning
from Combat Crew Training School (CCTS).
1.16.3. (Added) Examiners will make every effort to minimize their interference with crew
coordination. Evaluators should not have the “A” code, except when absolutely necessary.
1.16.4. (Added) . 6 OG/OGV/927 OG/OGV will maintain a recommended checkride profile on
the OGV SharePoint website. The recommended profile will be used as a guide only to ensure
the completion of checkride requirements in an efficient manner. Mission profiles may deviate
as long as all requirements are completed.
1.16.5. (Added) Mission Cargo [MSN(Cargo)] evaluations may be accomplished by loading
cargo (floor or palletized) for actual missions/deployments, or under static conditions. No more
than two boom operators will receive evaluation credit per load. Cargo Uploading and
Downloading procedures will be evaluated. The download procedures may be verbally
evaluated if it is not practical for the evaluator to observe it.
2.5.2. Operational Mission Evaluation (OME). All pilots not previously certified as an aircraft
commander in the KC-135 will complete a one-time OME prior to aircraft commander
certification demonstrating their ability to operate in command. The focus of the evaluation
should be on decision making, Crew Resource Management (CRM), leadership, general
knowledge, and airmanship.
2.5.2.3. (Added) Evaluation procedures. The OME will be a SPOT evaluation with no set
requirements other than all items under “General” and an EPE. However, all areas under
Qualification/Mission and Instrument actually accomplished will be graded. Mission legs
should be flown from the left seat with an instructor in the right seat. If flying from the right seat
(instructor in the left seat), the examinee will continue to act as Pilot in Command (PIC) and run
the mission, demonstrating the ability to supervise from the right seat. The evaluator should be
an additional crewmember to the basic crew. Once the evaluation is complete, the evaluatee will
not perform PIC duties until he/she is certified by the squadron commander in accordance with
AFI11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.
2.5.2.4. (Added) Failure to pass an OME. If an examinee receives a Q-3, they will be placed in
supervised status until all additional training is complete and a subsequent recheck SPOT (OME)
has been successfully accomplished.
2.7. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). At the evaluator’s discretion, the EPE may
include a verbal or hands on demonstration, a scenario type emergency situation, and/or general
knowledge questions.
2.7.1. (Added) The examinee may reference any notes, manuals, or training aides, as
appropriate, during the EPE.

2.7.2. (Added) EPE Topics. EPEs will incorporate knowledge to include, but not limited to,
aircraft systems knowledge (to include operations, limitations, emergency/abnormal procedures),
crew resource management, associated directives, and airmanship/judgment. A recommended
list of EPE topics will be posted on the 6 OG/927 OG SharePoint websites.
