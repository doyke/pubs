SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision identifies and expands mission qualification training and continuation training for
both ASOC operations and support personnel. It adds upgrade training programs for the
Procedural Controller, Senior Air Director and Senior Air Technician (formerly known as the
Crew Superintendent). The Ground Track Manager duty position is now referred to as the
Interface Control Technician. In order to standardize duty position training, gradesheets were
added to the Theater Air Control Training Information Computer System (TACTICS) with
samples included in this AFI.

                                    RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Introduction. This instruction establishes minimum requirements to train personnel
performing Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) duties to achieve and maintain Combat
Mission Ready (CMR) status. Personnel will have varying backgrounds and different levels of
experience and proficiency. Commanders and supervisors will design an appropriate course of
training based on the individual’s background and experience.
1.2. Guidance. The training and performance standards outlined in this instruction facilitate the
employment of ASOC personnel to accomplish their duties and responsibilities effectively and
efficiently.
   1.2.1. Commanders will define the unit’s training program in a unit Operating Instruction
   (OI) tailored to meet those missions identified in the unit’s Designed Operational Capability
   (DOC) statement, and conducted in conjunction with joint training exercises to the maximum
   extent possible. Squadron OI’s cannot be less restrictive than their parent Group’s OI (if
   their Group has an OI on ASOC training).
   1.2.2. This AFI is applicable to the following:
       1.2.2.1. Operations personnel assigned to ASOC duty positions, or personnel tasked to
       deploy as part of an ASOC Unit Type Code (UTC) (see Attachment 1 Terms).
       1.2.2.2. Support personnel assigned to an ASOC, or personnel tasked to deploy as part of
       an ASOC UTC (see Attachment 1 Terms).
       1.2.2.3. Personnel assigned to the 6th Combat Training School (CTS) who are performing
       ASOC instruction, observer/controller, or are tasked to perform ASOC duty.
       1.2.2.4. Personnel assigned to any unit performing observer/controller functions for
       ASOC training events.
   1.2.3. Commanders will not enter or will withdraw personnel from training when:
       1.2.3.1. Individuals permanently deferred from worldwide mobility.
       1.2.3.2. Individuals permanently deferred from carrying weapons.
       1.2.3.3. Individuals unable to perform duties due to Uniform Code of Military Justice
       (UCMJ) action.
       1.2.3.4. Individuals who are applicants for or have been granted conscientious objector
       status.
       1.2.3.5. Individuals identified as drug or alcohol dependent. For personnel currently
       enrolled in a substance abuse/dependency program, or if an individual is cleared or
       reclassified as NOT drug or alcohol dependent by competent medical authority, the
       Group commander may re-enter or continue the individual in training.
       1.2.3.6. Individuals who do not possess a security clearance. For individuals who do not
       possess a security clearance, commanders may request an Interim Security Clearance
 6                                                                  AFI13-114V1 30 April 2013

        into training.
     1.2.4. The commander will coordinate with the appropriate staff and personnel agencies, to
     include the staff judge advocate, to determine if disqualified or non-performing individuals
     should separate, retrain or transfer to a duty position that would allow continued service.
1.3. Responsibilities. Table 1.1 lists specific responsibilities. Air Combat Command (ACC) is
considered the Lead Command for this instruction. ACC/A3F is the office of primary
responsibility for ACC.
     1.3.1. The 607th Air Support Operations Group (ASOG) is the only ASOG that has Group
     personnel performing ASOC duties.
        1.3.1.1. The following rules in Table 1.1 listed under "Group Training Manager"
        responsibilities apply ONLY to the 607 ASOG (Pacific Air Forces [PACAF]): Rule 19;
        Rule 20; Rule 21; Rule 22; Rule 23; Rule 24; and Rule 25. All other ASOGs that have

                    TRAINING AND QUALIFICATION STANDARDS

2.1. Unit Operating Instruction (OI). The unit OI outlines how units will implement the
requirements of this instruction. Post the unit OI with this instruction and any other applicable
supplements (hardcopy or digital). The unit commander will approve the operating instruction.
The OI will, as a minimum, address the following items to support the unit’s training program
(from initial qualification training [IQT] through MQT to CMR status, the CT process, and
Upgrade training):
   2.1.1. Purpose, applicability, and training manning.
   2.1.2. Unit training manager’s responsibilities.
   2.1.3. Training documentation procedures.
   2.1.4. Additional MQT, CT and Upgrade requirements unique to each unit, as appropriate.
   2.1.5. Squadrons will forward OIs to the group UTM for review. Group UTMs will assist
   subordinate units to address all required areas.
2.2. Unit Training Process.
   2.2.1. The ASOC Initial Qualification Course (IQC) satisfies the minimum IQT
   requirements for ASOC Operations personnel, and fills the initial TACTICS requirements for
   the topics covered. Attendance at ASOC IQC is not required for ASOC support personnel.
   See Chapter 3 for additional IQT requirements.
   2.2.2. MQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify a member in specific duty
   position(s) required to perform missions assigned to a specific unit. Completion of MQT is a
   prerequisite for CMR status.
   2.2.3. Commanders certify, in writing, an individual as CMR after completion of IQT (if
   required) and MQT (Chapter 5).
   2.2.4. CT is unit specific training or higher headquarters identified training to maintain or
   increase CMR proficiency.
   2.2.5. Training tasks identified with a subject knowledge level code will have a written test
   developed that objectively evaluates required knowledge levels for all training tasks.
   2.2.6. Training tasks identified with a task performance level code will have a task
   evaluation with a grade of 2 or better to meet ASOC Training Task List (TTL) standards.
2.3. Training Program and Schedule Adjustments.
   2.3.1. Commanders may adjust the training time or remove personnel from training due to
   medical disqualification, emergency leave, deployments, or administrative action. The
   supervisor or UTM will document adjustments in the individual’s AF 623A or ASOC
   Training Folder.
   2.3.2. The commander may adjust the training dates for completion of requirements based
   on an individual’s TDY or emergency leave of 30 cumulative days [three (3) unit training
   assemblies (UTAs) for ANG] or more. Personnel who are TDY for 30 consecutive days or 3
 12                                                                AFI13-114V1 30 April 2013


   UTAs or more will continue to accomplish training at temporary locations where MQT or CT
   training is available.
   2.3.3. Training extensions will be granted based on any circumstances other than TDY or
   emergency leave that a commander determines requires a training extension. As
   circumstances dictate, unit commanders may grant an individual one training extension in
   each phase of training. Group commanders can grant a second extension. If necessary,
   MAJCOM OPRs may grant a third extension. One training extension equals 30 calendar
   days, or 3 UTAs for ANG units. If training is still not complete, the MAJCOM OPR will
   determine whether or not the individual is to be removed from training.
   2.3.4. Previously certified CMR ASOC personnel. ASOC personnel that were previously
   certified CMR at an ASOC, and received the special experience identifier (SEI) 045, are not
   required to attend ASOC IQC. It is recommended that they attend ASOC IQC, but that is at
   the discretion of the unit commander. Once at the unit, they will complete MQT. This
   training will be specifically designed and tailored (as determined by the unit commander and
   unit training manager; based on the individual’s experience and requirements) to get the
   individual to CMR status (similar to ASOC CMR re-certification in paragraph 5.4).
2.4. ASOC Training Folder.
   2.4.1. The ASOC Training Folder is a four-part folder that documents ASOC training. It is
   required for those ASOC operations personnel that do NOT maintain their training on an AF
   623 (i.e. fighter duty officers, intelligence duty officers, senior fighter duty technician) or
   AFSC approved electronic media. See paragraph 1.8 for further information.
      2.4.1.1. Part 1 is the “Table of Contents.”
      2.4.1.2. Part 2 is “Combat Mission Ready Status.” Commander memorandums for record
      on CMR status, with the most recent on top.
      2.4.1.3. Part 3 is “Training Events.” Training events include AF Form 1098s for MQT
      and CT, MQF scores, Full Mission Trainer (FMT)/Part Task Trainer (PTT) gradesheets,
      etc. Supervisors will update this form as individuals accomplish the training events, and
      will review them semi-annually. There is no need to archive hardcopy training from
      previous years.
      2.4.1.4. Part 4 is “Formal IQT Certificates.” This portion will have the certificate of
      training from ASOC Initial Qualification Course (PDS:-XEQ), and the JT-101/JT-102
      certificates (as required). Include the ASOC IQC student training report until the person
      achieves CMR.
2.5. ASOC Augmentee Training Requirements.
   2.5.1. Individuals scheduled to augment ASOC operations must attend the ACC ASOC
   Initial Qualification Course, and complete unit MQT items (as determined by the gaining
   ASOC commander and gaining ASOC unit training manager) prior to deploying to fill an
   ASOC duty position.
   2.5.2. Individuals scheduled to augment ASOC support personnel must complete unit
   required MQT items (as determined by the gaining ASOC commander and gaining ASOC
   unit training manager) prior to deploying to fill an ASOC support position.
AFI13-114V1 30 April 2013                                                                  13


   2.5.3. For operations personnel, an augmentee is defined as any individual that is not a
   qualified ASOC operations crewmember, but is scheduled to fill an ASOC operations crew
   duty position. See Attachment 1 for definition of operations personnel.
2.6. Operations Crew Training. This training is focused on executing the fundamental ASOC
air-to-ground, command and control mission. The objective of all crew training is to improve
decision making, situational awareness, resource management, collaborative support/integration
and other similar factors. To meet this objective, units should use a building block approach
consisting of PTTs and FMTs. See Attachment 1 for the definition of PTT and FMT.
   2.6.1. Because peacetime training rarely has all agencies and entities that the ASOC
   interfaces with available for participation, effective ASOC training depends upon
   supplemental support (white cell) to simulate these agencies and entities from the Theater
   Air-Ground System (TAGS) that the ASOC typically coordinates with during mission
   execution. See Attachment 1 for the definition of white cell.
       2.6.1.1. Units must provide the white cell with scenario basics, training requirements,
       event type, sequencing and intensity to define the parameters for scenario development.
       The ASOC Weapons and Training shop, or designated white cell player must act as an
       interface with other entities to modulate and focus white cell injects and responses to
       meet unit training objectives.
   2.6.2. To the maximum extent, use actual computer and communications systems to provide
   ASOC connectivity to external agencies within the theater air control system (TACS).
   Examples of these systems include, but not limited to, internet relay chat (IRC) programs,
   Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS), Tactical Air Control Party (TACP)
   Close Air Support System (TACP CASS), common operating picture, simulated radios, and
   aircraft through radios and/or digital gateways.
2.7. Support Personnel Training. Support personnel will accomplish specific training items
listed in Table 4.1 to complete ASOC mission qualification training. They will become ASOC
CMR IAW Chapter 5. Continuation training requirements for support personnel are listed in
Table 6.1.
 14                                                             AFI13-114V1 30 April 2013

                         INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. ASOC operations personnel should receive ASOC IQT prior to arrival to a new
duty station. If not, those individuals will complete IQT within 180 days (12 UTAs for ANG) of
arrival at the duty station. Attending the required formal training courses identified in
paragraph 3.2 completes IQT. Individuals awaiting formal training may enter MQT, but must
complete IQT before receiving CMR certification.
3.2. Formal Training Requirements.
   3.2.1. Personnel with the following operations AFSCs performing ASOC duty must attend
   the ACC ASOC Initial Qualification Course (IQC) (PDS:-XEQ), Nellis Air Force Base
   (AFB), Nevada (unit-funded):
       3.2.1.1. ASOC Operations officer AFSCs 1XXXU, 13XXX, and 14NXX.
       3.2.1.2. ASOC Operations enlisted AFSCs 1C4X1, 1C5X1, 1C5X1D, and 1N0X1.
       3.2.1.3. Individuals who graduated from the Air Liaison Officer Qualification Course
       (ALOQC) or Joint Firepower Course (JFC) within six (6) years of starting ASOC IQC; or
       were a previous 1C471 JTAC, need only attend the last two weeks of ASOC IQC.
   3.2.2. The following personnel must attend the ACC Intelligence Battlefield Airman (IBA)
   Intelligence Initial Qualification Course (IIQC) (PDS: OJC), Langley AFB, Virginia (ACC-
   funded). This training requirement is waiverable by the ASOG Commander (CC).
       3.2.2.1. AFSC 14NXX, Intelligence Officer performing ASOC duties.
       3.2.2.2. AFSC 1N0X1, Operations Intelligence Specialist performing ASOC duties.
3.3. ASOC Initial Qualification Training Requirements. ASOC IQT requirements for officer
and enlisted operations personnel are identified in the ASOC IQC Training Task List (TTL).
The ASOC IQC TTL, that includes the task measurement standards for each training
requirement, was developed by the functional community, and is maintained by HQ ACC/A3F

                                           Chapter 4

                         MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

4.1. General. Mission Qualification Training (MQT) provides unit-level training required for
CMR certification. MQT starts after IQT is completed for previously unqualified ASOC
personnel (non-SEI 045), and upon arrival for previously qualified, non-CMR (have SEI 045)
ASOC personnel. Individuals awaiting formal training may enter MQT early, but must complete
IQT before receiving CMR certification. There is not a required sequence for completing this
training unless otherwise specified. All FMT events (including certification) will be graded by a
CMR-qualified individual, and will use the gradesheets in Attachment 5. Failure to complete a
PTT/FMT event satisfactory will result in repeating that event until demonstrated performance
meets the required level. Complete all MQT requirements within 180 days of entry or 12 UTAs
for ANG.
   4.1.1. Operations personnel who complete IQT will be entered (re-entered for those
   individuals that started MQT prior to IQT) into MQT on the next duty day after arriving at
   home station (ANG following month).
   4.1.2. Support personnel will be entered into ASOC MQT within 5 days (ANG 1 month) of
   signing into the unit.
   4.1.3. MQT time extensions can be granted IAW paragraph 2.3.
4.2. MQT Definitions. All UTC tasked personnel, regardless of rank or AFSC, will comply
with the training requirements listed in this chapter. Commanders will identify additional unit
specific training requirements in the unit OI.
   4.2.1. Operations Personnel. Operations personnel are those individuals filling ASOC crew
   positions with the AFSCs listed in para 3.2.1.1 and 3.2.1.2. The crew duty positions are the
   Air Tasking Order Manager (ATOM), Air Space Manager (ASM), Senior Air Director
   (SAD), Joint Air Request Net (JARN) operator, Procedural Controller (PC), Interface
   Control Technician (ICT), Senior Air Technician (SAT), Intelligence Duty Officer (IDO) and
   Intelligence Duty Technician (IDT). See the Operations Personnel definitions under Terms
   in Attachment 1.
       4.2.1.1. The following crew duty positions require MQT: ATOM, ASM, JARN, ICT,
       IDO, IDT and PC (1C5D only). The SAD, PC (others) and SAT are upgrade ops crew
       duty positions (See Chapter 7) that do not require MQT.
       4.2.1.2. Multiple Qualifications. Personnel who certify on one of the duty positions
       listed, need only accomplish the applicable portions of training not previously
       accomplished for another duty position. For example, an individual who is a CMR ICT
       and subsequently trains as a JARN only needs to accomplish the specific JARN
       PTT/FMT events for certification. Similarly, an individual who is a CMR ATOM needs
       only to accomplish the specific ASM PTT/FMT events for certification to become an Air
       Space Manager.
   4.2.2. Support personnel. Support personnel consist of members performing the following
   functions: Cyberspace Control Officer/Superintendent; Cyber Systems Operations; Cyber
   Surety; Cyber Transport Systems; RF Transmission Systems; Power Production; Heating,
 16                                                              AFI13-114V1 30 April 2013


   Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVAC/R); Vehicle Maintenance; and
   Materiel Control. See the Support Personnel definitions under Terms in Attachment 1.
4.3. MQT Completion, Certification and Documentation.
   4.3.1. MQT is complete upon successful accomplishment of all the following items:
       4.3.1.1. Training Items in Table 4.1.
       4.3.1.2. ASOC ops crew duty position training (FMT)/support personnel training.
       4.3.1.3. Unit specific training, as required by unit OI (document on AF Form 797).
   4.3.2. Mission Qualification Certification.
       4.3.2.1. Academic assessment using questions from the ASOC Master Question File
       (MQF). (N/A for support personnel)
       4.3.2.2. Operations crew duty position training (FMT). (N/A for support personnel)
       4.3.2.3. FMT assessment.
   4.3.3. Supervisors will monitor an individual’s progress, and will notify the
   OTM/UTM/Director of Training (DOT) once an individual has completed all MQT
   requirements. The OTM/UTM/DOT can then administer the Academic Assessment, and
   schedule the FMT.
   4.3.4. Document all MQT events in the individual’s training folder. MQT may be
   electronically tracked via a MAJCOM-approved automated product until completion of MQT
   and certified CMR.
4.4. Support Function Training.
   4.4.1. MQT is complete upon accomplishment of all items detailed in duty section’s Master
   Training Plan (MTP), the Support items listed in Table 4.1, and a mission qualification
   certification (paragraph 4.3.2).
4.5. ASOC Augmentee Training Requirements. Individuals that augment ASOCs will
complete IQT and MQT requirements IAW Chapters 3 and 4, and unit required MQT items (as
determined by the gaining ASOC unit commander and training manager) prior to deploying to
fill an ASOC duty position (see paragraph 2.5).
   4.5.1. Document this training in the individual’s AF Form 623a, or ASOC Training Folder.

4.8. MQT Operations Crew Duty Position Training (FMT).
   4.8.1. Conduct at least two Full Mission Training (FMT) events per designated duty
   position. The unit commander may waive FMT-1 based on the individual’s experience and
   requirements. The unit commander will determine the duty positions in which an individual
 20                                                                  AFI13-114V1 30 April 2013


   will receive training during MQT based upon current unit manning requirements, individual
   capabilities/AFSC, and guidance within this instruction. Conduct FMTs using IW or
   Conventional Warfare (CW) scenarios. The FMT scenarios will be designed and executed
   according to the unit OI and unit commander’s discretion.
   4.8.2. FMT events must be accomplished in sequential order within each duty position (IW
   or CW). Training may overlap between different duty positions. For example, an officer
   may complete FMT-1 for ASM and then FMT-1 for ATOM, and complete FMT-2 for
   ATOM followed by FMT-2 for ASM.
         4.8.2.1. FMT-1, Coaching: MQT personnel perform ASOC crew duties with
         some/minimal assistance (“over the shoulder” from an individual that is CMR-qualified
         in the same duty position). This training will include duty position preparation, execution
         and changeover brief. The FMT-1 scenario should be less complex than FMT-2.
         4.8.2.2. FMT-2, Monitoring: MQT personnel perform ASOC crew duties without any
         assistance (an individual that is CMR-qualified in the same duty position CMR-qualified
         individual will observe). This training will include duty position preparation, execution
         and changeover brief.
         4.8.2.3. FMT-Assessment: Accomplish FMT assessment IAW paragraph 4.9.2 upon
         completion of all FMT events.
4.9. MQT Certification. Upon completion of all FMT events and other MQT requirements,
units will conduct an Academic and Operational Mission Qualification Assessments to validate
the individual’s capability to fully perform appropriate functions in the ASOC. For operations
personnel, this will include any and all of the previously trained ASOC ops crew duty positions
in both IW and Conventional Warfare scenarios.
      4.9.1. Academic Assessment. OTM/DOT will administer an ASOC MQF examination to
      complete this assessment. Maintain the completed MQF exam score and date in the
      individual’s ASOC Training Folder. N/A for support personnel.
      4.9.2. Operational Assessment. Conduct at least one FMT in performing this assessment.
      Only one FMT event is required to complete this training, but must sufficiently address all
      areas of knowledge and performance either through observation or discussion. An individual
      that is CMR-qualified in the respective duty position will accomplish this certification.
      4.9.3. MQT personnel are certified CMR upon completion of the assessments, and must be
      approved by the squadron commander. Commanders will document CMR status in an MFR,
      and comply with requirements outlined in Chapters 5 and 6. The squadron commander or
      OTM/UTM will maintain a document (Letter of X’s) that identifies an individual’s particular
      operations crew duty qualifications (see Attachment 4).
4.10. ASOC Master Question File (MQF). The ASOC MQF is a set of applicable questions
designed to assess knowledge about an ASOC. ACC/A3F is responsible for ensuring that an
applicable MQF questions database is produced to support this AFI.
      4.10.1. Updates to the MQF. ACC/A3F will conduct an annual review of the MQF, with
      assistance from the NAFs, and from other MAJCOMs and ANG, and their respective units.
AFI13-114V1 30 April 2013                                                                       21


      4.10.1.1. The review will focus on correcting erroneous questions, deleting outdated or
      invalid questions, and/or adding new questions to the database as a result of reference
      document changes.
      4.10.1.2. MAJCOMs will forward their suggested changes to HQ ACC/A3F. HQ
      ACC/A3F will adjudicate all MAJCOM inputs, and publish an updated MQF within 30
      days of the end of the review process.
   4.10.2. The unit OTM/UTM is responsible for constructing the ASOC MQF examination.
      4.10.2.1. Security. Only the OTM/UTM or individuals designated by the commander
      will administer examinations. They will maintain strict control of all examinations and
      answer keys by securing them in a locked container or password-protected computer
      program.
      4.10.2.2. Construction of Questions. Questions must measure the correct information at
      the desired level of knowledge.
          4.10.2.2.1. Each question must include the correct answer and the reference
          document, paragraph, and page number for the subject matter.
          4.10.2.2.2. Questions will be multiple-choice (four choices desired with only one
          correct answer).
          4.10.2.2.3. Questions that have numerical answers will have the answers arranged in
          order from largest to smallest or vice versa.
          4.10.2.2.4. In general, questions should avoid negative statements. However, if the
          word “not” appears in the question, either underline it or type it in all capital letters
          for attention.
   4.10.3. MQF classification guidelines. ACC/A3F will strive to maintain an unclassified
   ASOC MQF database; however, the overall MQF classification will match the highest
   classification of any one MQF question. Units and ACC/A3F will manage any question(s)
   extracted from the ASOC MQF database according to their classification. Examinations will
   be appropriately marked and secured. Whether the examination contains classified questions
   or not, it will be handled as a controlled item.

       from CT requirements in Tables 6.1 and/or 6.2 warrants the individual to be placed on N-
       CMR status. Commanders should base their decision on the number of requirements not
       completed, and impact on unit mission.
       5.3.1.5. Deployments/Extended Non-availability. Individuals may count activities
       conducted during this period towards CT requirements. Unit commanders will establish
       a “grace period” for personnel returning from extended non-availability (>60 days) in
       which they are afforded the opportunity to complete CT requirements without being
       placed in N-CMR status.
   5.3.2. Document N-CMR status with a signed memo for record, filed in Part 2 of the
   individual’s ASOC Training Folder/AF 623 (TBA or AFTR).
5.4. Regaining Combat Mission Ready Status.
   5.4.1. N-CMR individuals must successfully accomplish the task(s) in which they are
   deficient in order to regain CMR status. OTM/DOT will work with the individual’s
   supervisor to develop a training plan to address the individual’s deficiencies.
   5.4.2. If the N-CMR individual’s training plan requires being re-entered into MQT, comply
   with paragraph 4.10.
   5.4.3. Commanders will recertify an individual’s CMR and documentation will be filed in
   the individual’s ASOC Training Folder.
5.5. Failure to Complete Training Items (Task Deficiency).
   5.5.1. OTM/DOT, through the individual’s supervisor, will notify the unit commander of an
   individual’s task(s) deficiency. Commanders and supervisors may annotate an individual’s
   deficiencies, without loss of CMR status (unless otherwise determined IAW paragraph
   5.3.1.3), in the specific areas below:
       5.5.1.1. Lack of academic/task training from Table 6.1.
       5.5.1.2. Lack of FMT event completion due to external factors from Table 6.2.
   5.5.2. Annotate any task deficiency on AF Form 1098 (or approved product), and place it in
   the individual’s ASOC Training Folder.
5.6. Training Task Recertification.
   5.6.1. The OTM/DOT and individual’s supervisor will design a training plan to recertify that
   individual on task(s) deficiency for commander approval. Proficiency training is complete
   when the individual demonstrates sufficient knowledge or skill to perform the deficient
   task(s) to the required standard as outlined in Chapter 6.
 24                                                               AFI13-114V1 30 April 2013


   5.6.2. The squadron commander or designated representative will annotate recertification on
   AF Form 1098 (or approved automated product) and placed in the individual’s ASOC
   Training Folder.
5.7. Operations Crew Duty Position Training Currency (FMT). Due to the important and
fundamental nature of crew operations in ASOC mission execution, operations personnel are
required to complete at least two FMT events every 180 days per qualified category of ASOC
duty position(s). ANG will complete one FMT event every 180 days.
   5.7.1. For individuals qualified in more than one category of ASOC ops duty position, it is
   acceptable to be current in one category of duties but non-current in others.
   5.7.2. Failure to remain current in specific crew position. Any non-current individual cannot
   perform that specific ASOC crew duty until regaining currency as follows:
      5.7.2.1. If 181-365 days since last FMT event: accomplish an FMT event with the
      supervision of a current and CMR individual, qualified in the same duty position.
      5.7.2.2. Greater than 365 days since last FMT event: accomplish an individual training
      plan approved by the unit commander.

                                  CONTINUATION TRAINING

 6.1. General. This chapter prescribes training standards to maintain CMR personnel qualified
 on mission knowledge, skills, and tasks. All personnel must accomplish continuation training
 (CT) events once per training period, unless otherwise specified.
     6.1.1. Recurring Training Period. CT requirements will use a sliding calendar for annual
     and biennial training events. This period begins at the end of month in which the training
     task was last accomplished. The ANG Recurring Training Period is 24 UTAs.
         6.1.1.1. Training period example. An individual who accomplishes a biennial training
         item on 10 September 2011 must re-accomplish that event by midnight, 30 September
         2013.
 6.2. Training Events. CT requirements will follow the basic ASOC training aspects outlined in
 Chapter 2. Academic-related training in all ASOC training aspects will be a combination of
 unit generated events and computer-based training (i.e., TACTICS). All academic-related
 training will require successful completion of an examination (80 percent minimum to pass).
     6.2.1. TACTICS will be used for ASOC CT requirements to the maximum extent possible
     (see Chapter 8). For those training areas not presently in TACTICS, unit or higher-
     headquarters developed training plans will be used until those areas are contained in
     TACTICS. Units should notify ACC/A3FC of these deficiencies in TACTICS.
     6.2.2. Units may use a combination of TACTICS and locally developed training (approved
     by the unit commander) to complete CT requirements. Locally developed training must
     include an examination identified in paragraph 6.3, and will be documented in TACTICS.
 6.3. Continuation Training. Table 6.1 identifies the ASOC continuation training requirements
 for both operations and support personnel. See Attachment 1, Terms, for definitions of
 operations personnel (OPS) and support personnel (SPT).
     6.3.1. The academic and task training prepares individuals to complete the Recurring
     Assessment Events (see paragraph 6.5).

1. See paragraph 5.7 for currency requirements.
2. Can be accomplished in any qualified ASOC operations crew duty position.
3. Procedural control training will be emphasized during FMT events.
      6.4.1. ASOC ops personnel that are qualified in multiple duty positions must accomplish at
      least two FMTs every 180 days for each duty position qualification. For example, an officer
      who is a qualified ASM, ATOM and SAD must do one FMT as the ASM, one as the ATOM,
      and one as the SAD. ANG must accomplish one FMT every 180 days.
      6.4.2. FMT events completed during MQT do not count toward maintaining CMR currency.
      The recurring training period begins from the initial CMR date.
6.5. Recurring Assessment Events. In order to ensure proficiency, accountability, and mission
readiness, personnel will receive a recurring assessment for each ASOC duty position in which
they are qualified. Failure to successfully complete a recurring assessment will result in an
individual being placed on N-CMR status in that duty position (see paragraph 5.3).
   6.5.1. Academic assessment. Operations personnel will complete a test from the ASOC
   Master Question File (MQF) on a recurring basis.
   6.5.2. Operational assessment. Operations personnel will complete a crew duty assessment
   on a recurring basis. This will be conducted via an FMT event with a CMR-qualified
   individual observing performance. The assessment should analyze, by observation or
   discussion, an individual’s performance and knowledge in all qualified duty positions.
   6.5.3. There can be a maximum of 17 months between assessments. For example, an
   individual who accomplishes an Academic assessment on 10 August 2011 must re-
   accomplish that Academic assessment by midnight, 31 January 2013.
   6.5.4. The Academic assessment is a separate event, and not directly tied to the Operational
   assessment. For example, an individual who is dual qualified as an ATOM and ASM must
   accomplish one Academic assessment, one ATOM FMT assessment, and one ASM FMT
   assessment within 17 months.
         6.5.4.1. The PC and SAD/T have a separate, duty position specific Academic
         assessment. See Chapter 7. All other ASOC crew duty positions only have the MQF
         Academic assessment.
         6.5.4.2. Operational assessments may be combined into one event if: 1) the individual
         doing the assessments is qualified in the same duty positions as the individual taking the
         assessments; and 2) there is enough time and the mission scenario allows for the
         accomplishment of all required tasks for each duty position being assessed.

   6.5.5. Informal assessments and feedback should be conducted during all FMT events.
   Supervisors should recommend additional training and/or N-CMR status for individuals who
   do not demonstrate a satisfactory level of performance and/or operational knowledge.
6.6. Documentation. Document completed training tasks for officer and enlisted on AF Form
1098, or approved product. The most recent copy of these documents will be kept in the
individual’s ASOC training folder IAW paragraph 2.4.
   6.6.1. Record the score and date of the most recent MQF examination on an MFR in all
   ASOC Training Folders. As applicable, record the score and date for the PC and/or SAD/T
   Academic assessment in the ASOC Training Folder.
   6.6.2. Document the operational assessments (FMTs) using the gradesheets in Attachment
   5.
   6.6.3. Document the comprehensive skills assessment on AF Form 803.

          7.2.3.5.1. PTT-1. A current PC-qualified individual demonstrates and then allows the
          PC candidate to conduct basic procedural control techniques and practices.
          7.2.3.5.2. PTT-2. Consists of limited aircraft; employs preplanned ACMs and
          preplanned indirect and joint fires.
          7.2.3.5.3. FMT-1. Consists of multiple types of aircraft (rotary and fixed-wing);
          employs simplistic enemy threats, preplanned and dynamic ACMs, and indirect and
          joint fires.
   7.2.4. PC Assessment. Units will conduct an initial assessment of PC candidates to validate
   their aptitude and competency to control airborne assets. This assessment will be
   accomplished by a PC-qualified individual.
       7.2.4.1. Academic assessment. Explain procedural control, airspace factors, and combat
       operations to the level of satisfaction as determined by the certifying PC-qualified
       individual.
       7.2.4.2. Operational Assessment (PC FMT). Conduct an FMT PC assessment event.
       This assessment should consist of numerous types of aircraft, significant enemy activity,

   completion of all PC assessments. This MFR will be maintained in the individual’s ASOC
   training folder. The unit commander or OTM/UTM will maintain a document (Letter of X’s)
   that identifies an individual’s PC qualifications, and will maintain documentation in the
   individual ASOC training folder.
7.3. Senior Air Director / Senior Air Technician (SAD/T) Upgrade Training. Squadron
leadership should only nominate, and unit commanders should only approve, the most qualified
individuals for SAD/T training. A highly qualified individual is experienced in multiple ASOC
duty positions. This upgrade is the most comprehensive process within ASOC duty position
qualification training, and requires significant resources to complete.
   7.3.1. SAD/T Prerequisites. Personnel upgrading to SAD/T must have a minimum of one
   year of CMR experience. Individuals upgrading to SAT must be a Senior NCO 1C471
   DAFSC.
       7.3.1.1. Squadron commander may waive up to six months of CMR experience.
   7.3.2. SAD/T Academic and Exercise Training. Units will tailor this training plan for each
   individual candidate for squadron commander approval. It should be designed for hands-on
   experience, as well as classroom training. Training should include the following areas:
       7.3.2.1. Joint Fires capabilities and integration.
       7.3.2.2. Army CAS planning and TACP operations (e.g. accomplished through
       participation/ observation during a major division/corps level exercise, such as GREEN
       FLAG, UNIFIED ENDEAVOR, division/corps mission readiness exercise [MRX], etc.).
       7.3.2.3. Digitally-aided CAS and Gateway operations, processes and employment. The
       candidate must complete the Joint Interoperability Course (JT-101), and advanced
       Gateway academics (attending the Multi-Tactical Data Link Advanced Joint
       Interoperability Course (MAJIC) [JT-102] would satisfy this requirement).
32                                                            AFI13-114V1 30 April 2013


     7.3.2.4. AOC operations, processes and employment (e.g. accomplished by attending the
     Joint Air Operations Planning Course [JAOPC], Maxwell AFB AL).
 7.3.3. SAD/T Operations Crew Duty Position Training (FMT). SAD/T upgrade training will
 place specific emphasis on efficient ASOC crew operations and mission integration (refer to
 AFI 13-114, Volume 3, paragraph 2.5).
     7.3.3.1. FMT-1, Crew Operations. Focus on internal ASOC crew responsibilities,
     processes, and coordination.
     7.3.3.2. FMT-2, TAGS.      Focus on external integration with element of both the
     TACS/AAGS.
 7.3.4. SAD/T Assessment. Units will have a CMR-qualified SAD/T conduct an assessment
 of SAD/T candidates to validate their capability to function as a SAD/T.
     7.3.4.1. Academic assessment. Explain ASOC operations processes, functions, and
     squadron’s assigned mission to a CMR qualified SAD/T’s level of satisfaction.
     7.3.4.2. Operational Assessment. A CMR-qualified SAD/T will conduct an FMT
     assessment trainer to determine the SAD/T candidate’s ability to effectively
     manage/supervise the entire ASOC operations crew, and to properly integrate with other
     elements of the TAGS.
     7.3.4.3. Following the successful completion of the SAD/T candidate’s assessment, the
     unit commander must approve the SAD/T candidate. The unit commander or
     OTM/UTM will maintain a document (Letter of X’s) that identifies an individual’s
     positional qualifications, and will maintain documentation in the individual training
     folder.
 7.3.5. SAD/T Currency and Recurring Assessment.
     7.3.5.1. SAD/Ts must accomplish one FMT in the SAD/T duty position annually. The
     recurring assessment event does NOT count towards this requirement. If a SAD/T does
     not meet this requirement, they must retrain IAW a unit commander approved retraining
     program, and documented in the individual’s training record.
     7.3.5.2. All CMR SAD/Ts will accomplish a recurring assessment IAW paragraph
     6.5.2, specific to SAD/T duties.
AFI13-114V1 30 April 2013                                                                      33


                                           Chapter 8

   THEATER AIR CONTROL TRAINING INFORMATION COMPUTER SYSTEM

8.1. General.
   8.1.1. TACTICS provides the user with access to online courseware, and the ability to record
   courses and tests taken offline from the training tables. Users also have access to the Power
   Point® presentations associated with each course, including full course notes as well as all
   non-restricted references and a glossary of terms.
   8.1.2. Access into TACTICS is divided into three separate areas: Super User, Level II and
   Student. Super User access is reserved for administrative use only. Level II access is an
   administrative level for users that allows them to enter assigned personnel into the TACTICS
   system and to track unit/individual progress. Level II use is regulated by ACC/A3FC, with
   inputs from the other MAJCOMs, and will be granted only to accommodate the level of view
   necessary to perform assigned duties. Typically, the Level II users are the Unit Training
   Managers, but can include higher ranking officers with a need-to-know. Student is the
   standard user level that allows a member to take tests and view their individual progress only.
8.2. Training in TACTICS. Training in TACTICS is accomplished through units known as
Modules. Each module is followed by a mandatory test and a criterion checklist, when
applicable. Test formats are either true-or-false, or multiple choice, and test questions are
randomly generated each time. TACTICS tests are designed to be taken in an open book format.
Visual cues give the learner immediate indication of which modules they have not attempted,
attempted and failed, or completed successfully.
   8.2.1. All user scores are stored and maintained, as well as the individual answers to each
   question, so a user may go back and review those questions they missed. If the user is
   unsuccessful in accomplishing a test, they are not allowed to view their responses and must
   review the training material. However, if the person passes the test but has missed one or
   two questions, they will be allowed to review the correct responses and the associated
   references. Supervisors are notified via e-mail of a subordinate’s progress (pass/fail) through
   the training modules.
8.3. Responsibilities for TACTICS. The responsibilities for use of TACTICS are as follows:
   8.3.1. ACC/A3FC will:
       8.3.1.1. Be responsible for overall control and management of the TACTICS system.
       8.3.1.2. Grant, upon request, Level II access for TACTICS on a need-to-have basis.
       8.3.1.3. Provide direction and prioritization of module production.
   8.3.2. Commanders will:
       8.3.2.1. Ensure that TACTICS is instituted and operated at unit level.
       8.3.2.2. Utilize TACTICS to track individual/unit training status.
   8.3.3. Level II/Administrators will:
       8.3.3.1. Ensure that personnel are knowledgeable of TACTICS.
 34                                                               AFI13-114V1 30 April 2013


      8.3.3.2. Ensure that incoming personnel are registered in the TACTICS system and that
      their personnel information is correct.
      8.3.3.3. Upon permanent change of station (PCS), transfer personnel registered in the
      TACTICS departing the unit to their gaining unit.
      8.3.3.4. Track individual/unit training progress and report to the commander any
      negative trends.
      8.3.3.5. Use their chain of command to request any upgrades to Level II access.
      8.3.3.6. If  problems       occur,           contact       technical      support       at
      techsupport@odysseyconsult.com.
   8.3.4. Standard Users/Students will:
      8.3.4.1. Upon PCS, contact the gaining Unit Training Manager to ensure that their
      registration in TACTICS was transferred.
      8.3.4.2. Maintain current e-mail addresses for themselves and their supervisor in the
      TACTICS system (This is a priority).
      8.3.4.3. Maintain current Student Profile information.
      8.3.4.4. Read the system messages each time they login to stay aware of course additions
      and updates.
      8.3.4.5. Contact technical support at techsupport@odysseyconsult.com if problems
      operating TACTICS occur.
8.4. TACTICS Level II Access.
   8.4.1. Each Squadron and Group should have a limited number of personnel with Level II
   access capability in order to load newly assigned personnel, and to monitor all training
   progression in the unit. Level II access is usually reserved for the unit commander, director
   of operations, operations superintendent, training NCOIC, and any other person identified by
   the commander.
   8.4.2. Each squadron will forward the names of the personnel requiring Level II access to
   their appropriate Group (for those squadrons without a Group, forward names to appropriate
   MAJCOM). The Groups will forward the names to the appropriate MAJCOM. USAFE and
   PACAF will submit names to ACC/A3F, who will process all Level II access requests.

Terms
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—The status awarded to an individual who completes IQT and
MQT, and is certified by the commander (Chapter 5).
Continuation Training (CT)—Training required to maintain duty position qualification.
Full Mission Trainer (FMT)—An FMT event requires crew and system integration for
operations personnel to perform part or all of the ASOC mission/functions. Crew size is scalable
for an FMT event, but having the majority of the duty position functions performing will make
for a more effective training session. The FMT may be accomplished via live events (e.g. large
scale exercises or local CAS training) used in conjunction with simulation (virtual or
constructive) methods that emulate functions and players not within the exercise. Fully
simulated events are most appropriate when ASOC training objectives have priority over all
other players.
ASOC FMT Scenarios. ASOC FMT scenarios fall within two broad categories: Irregular
Warfare (IW) and Conventional Warfare (CW).
Irregular Warfare (IW). IW is a type of warfare that is not associated with a traditional linear
battlefield, and is representative of contemporary real—world operations. Other terms
associated with IW include “non-linear warfare; stability, security, transition and reconstruction
operations (SSTR); and counter-insurgency (COIN) operations.” In many cases, kinetic
operations are less intense than information, mobility, and intelligence operations.
Conventional Warfare (CW). Conventional Warfare is a type of warfare that is linear in nature
with well—defined battle areas and boundaries between the opposing forces. Other terms
 44                                                                 AFI13-114V1 30 April 2013


associated with Conventional Warfare include “full-scale operations.” In many cases, kinetic
operations are the driving requirement.
Initial Qualification Training (IQT)—A formal training process designed to initially qualify an
individual to perform their duty position requirements without regard to unit’s operational
mission.
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training required to achieve a basic level of
competence in a unit’s primary tasked missions. This training is a prerequisite for CMR status.
Non—Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR)—The status CMR individuals are placed in after
failing to complete academic/proficiency training or currency requirements within the allotted
training cycle.
Operations Personnel—Individuals assigned to an ASOC duty position with the following
AFSCs; 1XXXU, 13XXX, 14N, 1C4X1, 1C5X1, 1C5X1D, and 1N0XX.
Operations Officer. The Operations Officer is from AFSC 13L, 11X, 12X or 13B, or a Senior
Non—Commissioned Officer (NCO) 1C471/1C491. The ASOC Operations Officer performs
the crew duties of Senior Air Director (SAD), Air Tasking Order [ATO] Manager (ATOM),
and/or Air Space Manager (ASM). A Senior NCO can fill ATOM or ASM duty positions, except
the Senior Air Director.
Officers may perform technician duties (except Senior Air Technician [SAT]), if required and
certified.
Senior Enlisted operations personnel may perform all technical duties, if required and certified.
Operations Enlisted. Enlisted ASOC operations personnel consist of Tactical Air Control Party
(1C4) specialist, Command and Control Battle Management Operator (1C5) or Weapons
Director (1C5X1D). These personnel perform the ASOC crew duties of JARN Operator,
Interface Control Technician (ICT), and/or Procedural Controller (PC). The Senior Air
Technician (SAT) position (formerly the Crew Superintendent) will be filled by a Senior NCO
1C4 AFSC (MAJCOM waiverable to E—6).
Intelligence Duty Officer/Intelligence Duty Technician (IDO/T). The IDO and IDT are
Intelligence personnel (14N and 1N0X1) fulfilling specific functions, and will complete MQT
certification.
Part Task Trainer (PTT)—A PTT event is any event where an individual performs a limited
aspect of the ASOC mission/functions. The training focuses on an individual performing limited
or specific operations crew duty functions. Systems training, initial position set-up and position
mission planning are examples of appropriate PTT events. The PTT may be accomplished via
live events (e.g. large scale exercises or local close air support [CAS] training), but is best
designed for small-scale, simulation (virtual or constructive) events.
Support Personnel—Individuals (other than Operations personnel) assigned to an ASOC UTC
duty position. Support personnel consist of members performing the following functions:
Cyberspace Control Officer (17D3B)/Superintendent (3D190). Manages system analysis and
design, programming, systems operation and maintenance, resource management and security
management. Directs activities for installing, maintaining, repairing, overhauling, deploying,

controllers. TACPs advise ground commanders on the capabilities and limitations of aerospace
power and provide the primary Air Force terminal attack control of close air support in support
of ground force (AFDD 2-1.7).
Unit Training Assembly (UTA)—UTA is one full ANG drill weekend. When computing due
dates, the UTA weekend on which an event initially takes place does not count. For example, a
reference allows for two UTAs for completion of an event. The original decision/event occurs
during the drill weekend in March. The unit/individual would have until the end of the drill
weekend in May to complete the action/response.
White Cell—The white cell (or actual agency) will inject training events that create tactical
problems and situations for the ASOC operations crew to resolve. The white cell (e.g.
Group/Squadron personnel, Distributed Training Operations Center [DTOC], Distributed
Mission Operations Center [DMOC]), in conjunction with unit training officers/Weapons and
Training shop, is responsible for the overall scenario development, management and execution.

A5.1. Gradesheets. The following are sample gradesheets for the Senior Air Director; Air
Space Manager; ATO Manager; JARN Operator; Interface Control Technician; IDO/IDT;
Procedural Controller; and Senior Air Technician.
     A5.1.1. These gradesheets must be used, and will be maintained in TACTICS. The
     TACTICS gradesheets will take priority over the “SAMPLE” gradesheets in this AFI. By
     doing it this way, any changes to the gradesheets will be more responsive to the field, and not
     be dependent on changing this AFI.
