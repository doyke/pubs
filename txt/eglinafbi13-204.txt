                                     INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose
   1.1.1. The purpose of this instruction is to provide policy and direction for scheduling
   airspace, ground space, range resources, and 96 TW maintained aircraft, and for gaining
   access and operating in the Eglin Test and Training Complex.
1.2. Scope
   1.2.1. This instruction applies to all users of the Eglin Test and Training Complex (ETTC).
1.3. Eglin Test and Training Complex
   1.3.1. The ETTC includes approximately 724 square miles of land and 98,000 square miles
   of water ranges covering most of the Gulf of Mexico. Schedulable airspace can be extended
   to 134,000 square miles over both land and water. It also includes the major test facilities
   such as the Guided Weapons Evaluation Facility (GWEF), the McKinley Climatic Lab
   (MCL), and the Joint Preflight Integration of Munitions and Electronic Systems (J-PRIMES)
   test facility. The ETTC is controlled and operated by the 96th Test Wing, Eglin AFB, FL,
   and is a Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB) activity.
1.4. Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB)
   1.4.1. MRTFB is defined as the designated core set of DoD Test and Evaluation (T&E)
   infrastructure and associated workforce that must be preserved as a national asset to provide
   T&E capabilities to support the DoD acquisition system. They are governed by DoDD
   3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) and AFI 99-109, Major Range and
   Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Test and Evaluation Resource Planning. Although MRTFB
   activities function primarily to enable DoD test and evaluation support missions, they may
   also perform other missions (operations, training, R&D, etc.).
   1.4.2. It is DoD policy that, as a national asset, the MRTFB shall be sized, operated, and
   maintained to provide T&E information to DoD Component T&E users in support of the
   DoD Research, Development, Test and Evaluation and acquisition process set out in DoD
   Directive 5000.1. The MRTFB shall provide a broad base of T&E capabilities sufficient to
   support the full spectrum of DoD T&E requirements, but shall not be unnecessarily
   duplicated. The MRTFB may be used by other DoD users (including DoD training users),
   and by users outside the Department such as U.S. Government Agencies, State and local
   governments, allied foreign governments, and commercial entities. Scheduling of the
   MRTFB shall be based upon a priority system that gives equitable consideration to all DoD
   Components and accommodates DoD acquisition program priorities.
1.5. Center Scheduling Enterprise (CSE)
   1.5.1. CSE is a computerized man-in-the-loop system established at Eglin AFB for the
   scheduling of all missions requiring the use of Eglin ranges or support resources. All
   activities will use the system to submit CSE Mission Requests. Organizations who do not
   have access to CSE should contact the 96th Operations Support Squadron, Current
   Operations Flight (96 OSS/OSO), for assistance.

    1.5.2. 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) (7SFG(A)) will use the US Army Range Facility
    Management Support System (RFMSS) scheduling software tool to submit missions into
    CSE for all Eglin Ranges.

                                    RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. 96th Operations Support Squadron (96 OSS)
   2.1.1. The 96 OSS is responsible for airfield management and scheduling the use of all air,
   ground, and water ranges in the ETTC. It is also responsible for scheduling required
   resources (facilities, threats, frequencies, etc.) for mission support. The 96 OSS is also
   responsible through the Joint Test and Training Operations Control Center (JTTOCC) for
   operational management of land and water ranges. The 96 OSS Airfield Operations Flight’s
   Eglin Mission Control (EMC) function is co-located with the Eglin Radar Control Facility
   (ERCF) and is responsible for providing aircraft clearance into/out of restricted/warning
   airspace and mission monitoring.
2.2. Current Operations Flight (96 OSS/OSO)
   2.2.1. The 96 OSS/OSO is responsible for the scheduling and execution day management of
   all missions requiring the use of Eglin range or support resources. It is comprised of three
   sections: 1) Scheduling Office, 2) JTTOCC, and 3) Frequency Control and Analysis (FCA).

                                          Chapter 3

                                   GENERAL POLICIES

3.1. Test Priority System
   3.1.1. The 96 TW priority is based on a 5 tiered process numbered 0 through 4 with 0 being
   the highest priority and 4 being the lowest. Each numbered tier criteria is outlined below.
   The priority must be indicated on each Mission Request submitted.                    Program
   Engineers/Managers are responsible for ensuring the correct default Tier priority is assigned
   to the program Job Order Number (JON) in the TWES. Deviations from the assigned
   priority during the scheduling process are sometimes necessary, based upon any Management
   Emphasis (ME) and management judgment, to ensure a more balanced and efficient use of
   96 TW resources.
   3.1.2. Tier 0, Quick Reaction Test (QRT)/Contingency Operations.
      3.1.2.1. Tier 0 priority is used for Higher Headquarters (HHQ) ordered rehearsals for
      specified contingency actions and quick reaction tests/Eglin Plan 70 operations. It is
      anticipated that these types of missions will be few in number. The 96 TW/CC is the
      approving authority for Tier 0 priority assignment. Tier 0 missions will have priority
      over all other mission activity on the Eglin range complex.
   3.1.3. Tier 1, Major Events/Stakeholder Allocation.
      3.1.3.1. Tier 1 priority is used for major exercises/resource intensive events and range
      allocations. The tier contains two sub-tiers, 1A and 1B.
      3.1.3.2. Tier 1A, Major Exercises/Resource Intensive Events. An example of mission
      activity that meets this sub-tier intent would be the annual Air Force Special Operations
      Command (AFSOC) EMERALD WARRIOR exercise. Customers are required to submit
      a Management Emphasis (ME) request for a priority assignment of 1A at least 6 months
      prior to execution. The 96 OG/CC is the approval authority for Tier 1A priority
      assignment. Tier 1A missions will have priority over all other mission activity on the
      Eglin range complex except for priority Tier 0 missions.
      3.1.3.3. Tier 1B, Range Allocations. Range allocations will be provided to major range
      users. Major users include AFSOC, 7SFG(A), 33 FW, 325 FW (W470 Airspace), 6
      Ranger Training Battalion (6 RTB), and 96TW/53WG Developmental/Operational Test
      (DT/OT). Allocations are specifically tailored towards meeting the organization’s most
      critical needs and will usually capture exclusive range assets that are typically used by a
      single unit and/or funded by a single unit. Allocations will not meet 100% of an
      organization’s mission requirements but will reduce the uncertainty for a large segment.
      Individual mission requests that exceed an organization’s Tier 1B allocation will not
      carry the 1B priority for the entire mission time. The time and/or air and ground space
      that is not included in the Tier 1B allocation will revert to the organization’s Tier 2
      priority. 96 OSS/OSO mission schedulers will determine if other mission requests out
      prioritize the exceeded Tier 1B allocation.
      3.1.3.4. Range Allocations will be set on a semi-annual basis, October to March, and
      April to September. Each organization will submit allocations requests, NLT 15 June for
14                                                  EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


     the October to March period and NLT 15 December for the April to September period, to
     96 OSS/OSO for consolidation. 96 OSS/CC will publish an initial approved allocation.
     Organizations will be allowed to submit a reclama to the initial allocation as necessary.
     The final Range Allocation, approved by the 96 OG/CC, is then published by 96
     OSS/OSO.
     3.1.3.5. Tier 1B Range Allocations will have priority over all other mission activity on
     the Eglin range complex except for priority Tier 0 and Tier 1A missions. Tier 1B and 2A
     test missions will not normally be considered for scheduling at the seven week point (for
     six week lock-in). Tier 1B allocation placeholders will be scheduled instead.
  3.1.4. DT/OT Test Priority Letter.
     3.1.4.1. 96 TW and 53 WG test organizations will submit test priority letters to 96
     OSS/OSO NLT the 15th of each month. The letters will contain unit requested test
     priorities for Tier 1A (previously coordinated), Tier 1B, Tier 2A, and Tier 2E programs.
     The Tier 2A listing should include programs requiring “Top 25” status due to extensive
     range resource requirements. The time period covered for each letter will be the two
     month period after the following month. Example: letter submitted 15 February would
     cover the following April-May time period. 96 OSS/OSO will consolidate the inputs,
     based on previous month’s priority rankings and inputs from OSS/CC and OG/CC, into a
     DT/OT priority listing and submit it to the 96 OG/CC for approval. Once approved, 96
     OSS/OSO will publish the priorities on the CSE Home page. The published priority
     listing will serve as an intra-tier tie breaker when building test mission schedules.
  3.1.5. Tier 2, US Government Test and Training Programs.
     3.1.5.1. Tier 2 priority is for all other US government test and training missions outside
     of Tier 1 and Tier 0 assignments. Tier 2 mission activity will have priority over Tier 3
     and Tier 4 missions. There are 7 sub-tiers contained in Tier 2. They are, in order of
     priority:
         3.1.5.1.1. 2A: Established DT/OT Testing programs.
         3.1.5.1.2. 2B: Pre-Deployment Training (imminent departure).
         3.1.5.1.3. 2C: Late Growth in Major Exercise/Event/Tier 1A (inside six months).
         3.1.5.1.4. 2D: Formal Syllabus Training.
         3.1.5.1.5. 2E: Other Testing (Demonstrations, Research, Comparative Tests, etc.).
         3.1.5.1.6. 2F: Competency Training/Proficiency Training.
         3.1.5.1.7. 2G: Non-Tenant Training.
  3.1.6. Scheduling tie breakers between training sub-tiers 2B, 2D, and 2F will be based on an
  organizational rack and stack and will rotate each month. A six month schedule of
  organizational tie breakers will be published by 96 OSS/OSO in conjunction with the semi-
  annual Tier 1B range allocation.
  3.1.7. Tier 3, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Commercial Programs. There are two sub-
  tiers contained in Tier 3. They are, in order of priority:
     3.1.7.1. 3A: FMS Test or Training.
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                               15


       3.1.7.2. 3B: Commercial Test or Events.
          3.1.7.2.1. Tier 3 mission activity will have priority over Tier 4 missions.
   3.1.8. Tier 4, Non-Interference Mission Activity.
       3.1.8.1. Tier 4 mission activities are missions that do not interfere with test/training
       operations on the Eglin range complex, or missions conducted at Test/Training facilities
       located in the Cantonment Area. Some examples are McKinley Climatic Lab, JPRIMES
       Anechoic Facility, Jackson Guard Controlled Burns, and RC3 approved university
       studies.
   3.1.9. Short-Range Scheduling Reserve.
       3.1.9.1. The short-range scheduling reserves are portions of range assets
       (airspace/ground space/spectrum/resources) that are blocked from the seven week
       scheduling process/six week lock-in. The range reserve is essential in maintaining
       scheduling agility for short-notice tests or new training requirements such as
       Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTP) changes and allows lower priority missions to
       request Management Emphasis if necessary. The reserves will be opened for scheduling
       at the two week mission submittal point and will be available to all users, based on their
       Tier priority. Range Reserve allocations will be published at the same time as
       stakeholder Tier 1B range allocations.
3.2. Security
   3.2.1. Classified information will not be included in CSE Mission Requests. If 96 OSS/OSO
   requires access to classified information to perform scheduling responsibilities, the test
   agency will send the necessary classified information by separate letter or brief to the
   appropriate scheduling personnel. TDs and other documents used as references or authority
   for CSE Mission Requests must be checked for OPSEC precautions. Any precautions
   identified must be considered in completing the CSE Mission Request and PMR.
3.3. Mishaps, Test Item Malfunctions and Incidents
   3.3.1. In case of an aircraft, ground, or explosive mishap, test item malfunction, or incident
   within the Eglin AFB test/training complex, the JTTOCC will coordinate scheduled mission
   activity within the mishap area to accommodate emergency actions.
3.4. Deployed Aircraft/Aircrew Support
   3.4.1. Sponsors for aircraft deployed to Eglin AFB supporting tests or training programs
   must ensure crews are briefed on range procedures. The deployed aircraft must be included
   on either the sponsor’s mission request or a separate piggyback mission submitted listing
   applicable resources for the piggyback mission.
   3.4.2. If 96 TW maintenance or munitions load personnel support is required, the mission
   requester must inform 96 OSS/OSO aircraft scheduling personnel with aircraft tail numbers
   prior to the 96 TW Daily Operations Order publishing.
3.5. Munitions Expenditure Reporting
   3.5.1. Range users are responsible for reporting munitions expenditures. There are two
   avenues to complete this requirement, depending on the type of mission.
16                                                 EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


     3.5.1.1. Training organizations are required to report their munitions expenditures
     immediately following the completion of their training event. An example of this is once
     an AC-130 has reported mission complete (weapons safe and the aircraft is ready to exit
     their profile), they will include in this same broadcast the number and type of munitions
     expended on the range to the JTTOCC/MMS. It is the JTTOCC/MMS responsibility to
     ensure both air and ground training mission POCs are reporting munitions expenditures
     when terminating their missions. This same methodology will be used when 7SFG(A)
     ground forces close their range or mission at the end of the training. 7SFG(A) ground
     forces will either phone or radio their munitions expenditures and closeout requirements
     to their assigned range control at the end of the training event prior to requesting range
     clearance. Small arms’ expenditure reporting is required daily when clearance from the
     range is requested. 7SFG(A) Range Controls will e-mail consolidated reports to the
     JTTOCC/MMS at the end of each day.
     3.5.1.2. Test Missions are required to have the test engineer/project officer submit a CSE
     PMR upon completion of each mission. Test engineers/project Officers should use the
     Expend Munitions link located on the CSE PMR Reporting page to expend munitions for
     each test. All CSE PMRs are due NLT COB one business day after mission completion.

                                  MISSION SCHEDULING

4.1. General
   4.1.1. All missions using 96 TW resources and missions radiating or using any part of the
   radio frequency spectrum will be scheduled through 96 OSS/OSO scheduling office.
   4.1.2. Any O&M Contractor taskings by the 96 Range Group utilizing a CSE range resource
   must be coordinated with 96 OSS/OSO scheduling office prior to task approval.
   4.1.3. All mission requesters will complete the CSE Mission Request to schedule resources.
   Instructions and examples for completing the CSE Mission Request are found in the on-line
   help documentation located on the CSE home page.
   4.1.4. When 96 TW aircraft and/or munitions are required, the requester will complete the
   CSE Mission Request with the aircraft configuration and/or type of munitions in the range
   resources area.
   4.1.5. Mission requesters without access to CSE should contact 96 OSS/OSO for assistance.
   4.1.6. 96 OSS/OSO will consider for scheduling all missions submitted in CSE. However,
   adequate plans, including flight profiles, safety footprints, and RFA should be in the hands of
   all support and control agencies no later than 0800 Central-Standard, five workdays prior to
   the mission date, unless a longer lead time is specified.
4.2. Eglin Long Range Forecast Weekly Meeting
   4.2.1. The weekly scheduling meeting will be held each Wednesday in order to review the
   upcoming three to eight weeks of customer range resource requirements. Each organization
   will ensure the long range forecast is updated with current requirements NLT 1200 hours
   every Tuesday. Every effort should be made to forecast requirements at least eight week
   prior to mission execution. Each organization conducting test and/or training on the Eglin
   Range complex will ensure a representative is in attendance at the weekly meeting. Failure
   to attend the meeting and place forecasted range requirements on the Eglin Long Range
   Forecast (ELRF)/CSE mission calendar may result in missions not being scheduled. In order
   to forecast range requirements, a CSE mission or Forecast template must be submitted into
   the system. Once submitted, it automatically is placed on the calendar. A link to the
   calendar may be found on the CSE Home page.
4.3. Mission Scheduling Procedures
   4.3.1. Missions submitted with a program JON in planning status or any phase other than
   active may be scheduled; however, it cannot be executed until the TD is signed. 96
   OSS/OSO mission scheduling personnel will place missions that do not reflect a JON in
   Active status on alert in CSE and notify the mission submitter of the alert status. The alert
   must be cleared and the TD signed by 1200hrs, the duty day prior to mission execution or the
   mission will be canceled. The exception is for ground task missions provided JON early
   turn-on is approved by 96 OSS/CC. Early turn-on requests must be endorsed by the
   requesting Squadron Commander (CC), Operations Officer (DO) or Technical Advisor (CA).
   Contact the Program Engineer for the project to initiate the early turn-on process. 96
18                                                  EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


  OSS/OSPJ will be responsible for ensuring all documentation is completed for organizations
  conducting training operations of the Eglin range complex.
  4.3.2. Seven Week Scheduling Cycle:
     4.3.2.1. CSE Mission Requests may be submitted to 96 OSS/OSO at any time prior to
     execution date, but no later than 0600L on the Friday, seven weeks prior to the mission
     execution week to be considered for the six week lock-in schedule. Friday, Saturday, and
     Sunday are considered one day for scheduling purposes, and requests for weekend
     missions will be submitted at the same time as Friday missions. All missions are subject
     to be pulled into the “scheduling box” immediately after submittal. Mission requesters
     may make changes to mission requests in CSE until the mission is pulled into scheduling
     by 96 OSS/OSOQ. After that time no changes can be made to a CSE Mission Request
     unless requested by an individual listed on the CSE Mission Request, scheduling liaison,
     or appropriate authority unless indicated by management.
  4.3.3. 96 OSS/OSO scheduling personnel will process the mission requests and build the six
  week schedule based on Tier priorities:
     4.3.3.1. Tier 1A and 1B allocation training missions will be scheduled first.
     4.3.3.2. Tier 1B and 2A test missions will not normally be considered for scheduling at
     the seven week point (for 6 week lock-in), Tier 1B allocation placeholders will be
     scheduled instead.
     4.3.3.3. Tier 2 and 3 missions will be considered for scheduling at this time provided
     they do not interfere with any organizational Tier 1B allocation, regardless of whether it
     has been requested (Tier 1B allocations are reserved up until the two week scheduling
     cycle).
     4.3.3.4. Missions interfering with the Short-Range Scheduling Reserve will not be
     scheduled at this time and will have to wait until the two week cycle to be considered.
  4.3.4. The six week schedule will be completed and briefed at the Wednesday Eglin Long
  Range Forecast Meeting. Missions making the six week schedule will be considered
  “locked-in”, guaranteeing their place on the schedule. It is important to note that the
  missions may contain scheduling notes or alerts that will contain scheduling caveats or
  conditions such as a requirement to share airspace or ground space with other missions.
  Mission submitters should pay close attention and ensure they review all alerts and
  scheduling notes attached to the mission.
  4.3.5. Locked-in training missions at the six week point will not be “bumped” off of the
  schedule or out prioritized by mission activity submitted at the two week point, regardless of
  their Tier priority. No training missions will make the six week lock-in schedule if they
  interfere with another organization’s Tier 1B allocation. Organizations will still be able to
  utilize their Tier 1B allocations at the two week point/cycle. Coordination to remove lock-in
  missions off of the schedule will take place at the organization commander level and must
  obtain impacted organization commander’s approval.
  4.3.6. Six Week Schedule coordination.
     4.3.6.1. Once locked-in, the test and training events will not be preempted by other
     missions without coordination and concurrence by the scheduled mission POC. If an
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                              19


     immediate operational or mission support requirement conflicts with scheduled test
     and/or training events, the 96 OSS/CC will consult with the Commander of the affected
     organization, prior to any cancellation. Should the Commander of the affected
     organization non-concur due to the operational risk resulting from such cancellation, the
     issue will be referred to the 96 OG/CC for arbitration and final decision.
  4.3.7. Mission changes for the six week schedule may be submitted at any time to 96
  OSS/OSO scheduling personnel. Changes will be worked based on available manpower and
  generally in the order they are received.
  4.3.8. Two Week Scheduling Cycle.
     4.3.8.1. Normal on-time mission submittal deadline for the two week scheduling cycle is
     0600L Friday, two weeks prior to the mission execution week. Missions submitted after
     this time are considered “Blackboards” (see paragraph 4.3.13.) and may not keep their
     normal priority. This also applies to additional resource requirements added after the on-
     time mission submittal deadline. With the six week schedule as a starting point, the
     additional test and training missions submitted at the two week point are then plotted
     (including assigning frequencies and aircraft) according to 96 TW priority and special
     considerations. All missions will be posted in CSE to include missions times and
     scheduling status. Every effort will be made by 96 OSS/OSO scheduling personnel to
     complete the schedule NLT 0800 hours on Wednesday the week prior to mission
     execution week.
  4.3.9. 96 TW Weekly Aircraft Scheduling Process.
     4.3.9.1. The weekly schedule will be the refinement to the two week schedule. Initial
     changes to the weekly schedule will be discussed with AMU Production Superintendents
     at the Tuesday Long Range Operations Scheduling meeting. The changes will be
     updated into the weekly CSE scheduling forecast NLT 1300 each Thursday. The 96
     TW/53 WG Weekly Aircraft Schedule will be reviewed by the 96 TW/CC, 96 OG/CC,
     96 MXG/CC, and 85 TES/CC or their designated representatives at the Wing Weekly
     Aircraft Scheduling Meeting. The signed schedule will be posted each Friday by MXG
     P&S. Reference paragraph 4.7 of this instruction for changes to the Weekly
     Schedule.
  4.3.10. 96 TW Daily Operations Order Publishing.
     4.3.10.1. At 1500L, three duty days prior to mission execution, changes will no longer be
     accepted until after the 96 TW Daily Operations Order is published at 1600L. Prior to
     this time, it is the mission requester's responsibility to frequently monitor their mission
     status. The published 96 TW Daily Operations Order shall be reviewed by the CAMMP
     to identify and resolve airspace conflicts/issues. The CAMMP will notify/coordinate
     potential impacts with all affected agencies. 96 OSS/OSO scheduling personnel will
     notify mission requesters and all support agencies scheduled on the CSE mission on all
     changes affecting their mission after the 96 TW Daily Operations Order is published.
  4.3.11. “Hot Seat” and “Warm Seat.”
     4.3.11.1. The Hot Seat/Warm Seat personnel are responsible for coordinating 96 TW
     Daily Operations Order mission changes prior to mission execution day and notifying the
20                                                  EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


     mission requester and support agencies scheduled on the CSE mission of these changes.
     The JTTOCC RCS and MMS will coordinate all mission changes on execution day. All
     mission changes involving R2915B, Shoreline, E/W Corridor, and N/S Corridor airspace
     to include blackboard missions will be coordinated through the CAMMP to ensure
     mission supportability.
  4.3.12. 96 MXG 1430 Daily Aircraft Scheduling Meeting.
     4.3.12.1. The 96 MXG/CD (or designated representative) will chair a daily scheduling
     meeting to preview and review the wing’s Weekly Schedule. The minimum content and
     participants are specified in AFMCI 21-165, paragraph 2.8. The meeting will preview
     two days of the Weekly Schedule and review the current day’s flying. AF FORM 2407s
     should be discussed at this meeting.
  4.3.13. Blackboard Missions.
     4.3.13.1. Late CSE Mission Requests are designated as Blackboard missions.
     Blackboard missions are requests considered to satisfy mission essential requirements but
     will not have the normal 96 TW priority assigned to the JON. All Blackboard missions
     will be reviewed and considered, but missions submitted on time will take priority based
     on prior commitment of resources. Blackboard mission requesters are encouraged to
     verify, to the maximum extent possible, the availability of resources prior to mission
     submittal. Blackboard missions submitted after 96 TW Operations Order publishing may
     require completion of an AF FORM 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination if
     using 96 TW/53 WG aircraft or munitions support. All Blackboard mission requests
     must be reviewed by 96 OSS/OSOQ for the assignment of frequency resources. All
     Blackboard missions will include a reason for the submittal, indicated by one of the
     approved codes (see Attachment 4).
  4.3.14. Plug-In Missions.
     4.3.14.1. A mission submitted during the normal scheduling cycle that is nonscheduled
     due to lack of resources will keep its priority and will be plugged into the schedule if the
     requested resources become available later. Up until the 96 TW Daily Operations Order
     is published, Plug-In missions will maintain their 96 TW priority for mission scheduling.
  4.3.15. Scheduled Hold Missions.
     4.3.15.1. In certain instances when two missions request the same or similar resources,
     96 OSS/OSO schedulers may place the lower priority mission on scheduled hold status.
     This will normally occur when the higher priority mission is a backup but is not a
     requirement. If the initially requested resources become available NLT 1200L the duty
     day prior to mission execution, the Scheduled Hold mission will be scheduled. The
     1200L time may be extended with approval of the 96 OSS/OSO Flight Chief.
  4.3.16. For scheduling purposes, the Scheduled Hold mission is treated the same as a
  scheduled mission. If the requested resources do not become available, the Scheduled Hold
  mission is non-scheduled and the appropriate non-scheduled code is annotated.
  4.3.17. Floater Missions.
     4.3.17.1. Missions may be submitted in CSE as “Floater Missions.” This allows the
     mission submitter to identify the specific days during the week that the mission can be
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                            21


     scheduled instead of submitting multiple missions in order to get one scheduled. Floater
     missions allow 96 OSS/OSO schedulers to balance the use of 96 TW range resources in
     addition to meeting the specific project requirements. Mission submitters will identify
     Floater missions in remark #1 in the general remarks section of the CSE mission request
     along with amplifying data. In addition, label the mission as a Floater in the mission
     information mission category section on the CSE mission request. Floater missions that
     move to another day will keep their assigned 96 TW priority.
  4.3.18. Cancellations, Changes, or Deletions.
     4.3.18.1. All cancellations, changes, and deletions should be reported promptly to 96
     OSS/OSO schedulers, Warm/Hot Seat personnel or, on execution day, the JTTOCC RCS
     or MMS. Early cancellations and deletions allow maximum opportunity to schedule
     resources for Plug-In and Blackboard missions. 96 OSS/OSO schedulers, Warm/Hot Seat
     personnel and the JTTOCC RCS or MMS will accept cancellations and changes to the
     mission via telephone from authorized personnel listed on the CSE mission requests or
     designated organization schedulers.
  4.3.19. Accounting for Missions.
     4.3.19.1. All requested missions, unless withdrawn, will be accounted for as scheduled
     or nonscheduled by 96 OSS/OSO scheduling personnel. Scheduled missions will be
     further qualified as conducted, aborted, or cancelled using cancellation codes in
     Attachment 2. Nonscheduled missions will use codes in Attachment 3. Forecasted
     missions will be automatically withdrawn in CSE at the start of the two week scheduling
     cycle.
  4.3.20. Off-Base Testing.
     4.3.20.1. 96 TW test missions conducted at locations other than Eglin that require Eglin
     schedulable CSE resources still require the submission of a mission request through CSE
     for recording purposes. These requests will be entered into CSE by the appropriate
     agency, NLT the day prior to the test, and do not require an AF FORM 2407. CSE
     Mission Requests must include a remark that the mission is being conducted at a TDY
     location, the test engineer's TDY telephone number, and the test location. The
     procedures for requesting and reporting results for 96 TW missions conducted within the
     Eglin complex also apply to 96 TW missions conducted away from Eglin.
  4.3.21. Cross-Country Missions.
     4.3.21.1. Requests will be entered into CSE by the appropriate activity for cross-country
     and out and back missions. Blackboard missions will require an AF FORM 2407,
     Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination approval (if scheduled after the 96 TW
     Aircraft Weekly schedule is published) if departing from Eglin. AF FORM 2407 is not
     required for Eglin aircraft returning to Eglin.
  4.3.22. Tyndall Drone and/or E-9 Aircraft Mission Support.
     4.3.22.1. Procedures for requesting Tyndall drone and/or E9 aircraft resources are
     outlined in 53 WEG Operating Instruction 11-2, 53 WEG Operating Schedule. Mission
     requesters are required to coordinate with the 53 TSS/OS prior to submitting CSE
     Mission Requests with Tyndall drone/E-9 and RCF resources.
22                                                  EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


4.4. Management Emphasis (ME)
  4.4.1. Any test or training program utilizing Eglin resources may request ME. ME is a
  special request used by programs that must have missions executed on a specific date/time or
  as soon as possible. Reasons for ME include, but are not limited to, an approaching
  acquisition milestone or Higher Headquarters (HHQ) direction.
  4.4.2. The ME process is also used when requesting a priority Tier 1A status. Tier 1A status
  requests must be submitted at least six months prior to the event. ME provides a mission with
  increased management attention towards getting on the schedule and may be scheduled over
  other higher priority missions.
  4.4.3. The 96 OSS/CC is the approval authority for granting ME. It should be noted that
  requested ME does not necessarily mean the missions are guaranteed to make the schedule.
  All missions requesting ME will be worked on a case by case basis. Program justification
  and impact to other mission activity will be the determining factor in getting ME missions on
  the schedule.
  4.4.4. ME requests must be sent to 96 OSS/OSO prior to the normal on-time mission
  submittal deadline using the Special Scheduling Consideration Request EAFB Form 773.
  The ME request must be endorsed by the requester’s squadron CC/CV/DO. Missions
  granted ME will be annotated on the CSE mission request. Every effort will be made to
  notify the requesting agency at least one week prior of ME approval status. If ME approval
  greater than one week prior is required for major test and/or training events, the request for
  longer lead time approval, including justification, must be included in the EAFB Form 773.
  4.4.5. When submitting missions for the following categories, requesters are required to also
  submit a ME Request EAFB Form 773:
     4.4.5.1. Late mission submittal.
         4.4.5.1.1. Management Emphasis requests are required for missions/mission changes
         submitted after the 96 TW Daily Operations Order publishing if the mission or
         change increases or changes the O&M contractor support. The intent is to allow the
         contractor to plan for infrastructure maintenance. A simple change like adding a
         tracking radar to a mission may take away several O&M personnel from planned
         maintenance for up to half a day. Planned O&M maintenance will normally take
         priority over O&M changes after the 96 TW Daily Operations Order has been
         published.
     4.4.5.2. Consecutive Day (CD) scheduling.
         4.4.5.2.1. CD scheduling pertains to 96 TW test programs requesting three or more
         consecutive days. The intent is to minimize the number of high priority programs
         monopolizing range airspace and resources over a short period of time. If test
         programs require minimal resources (e.g., airspace and communication frequencies
         only) then ME requests are not necessary. ME is also not required for ground task,
         test task, any off-base mission, missions that extend past midnight, weekend/holiday
         missions, and missions using fixed range facilities, e.g., A22, A24, C74, C80
         complex, C52A STEF.
     4.4.5.3. Weekend Support.
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                              23


          4.4.5.3.1. Management Emphasis (ME) requests are required for weekend missions
          using 96 TW/53 WG aircraft, 96 MXG support or 96 WF/DOO support. Final
          approval for weekend missions using 96 TW/53 WG aircraft and/or 96 MXG support
          is 96 TW/CC. 96 OG/CC is the approving authority for weekend 96 WF support. 96
          OSS/OSO will coordinate with supporting agencies and obtain approval once they
          receive the ME request. 96 TW/53 WG aircraft returning to Eglin, missions
          conducted off-base or missions using other command aircraft are not required to
          submit for weekend approval. ME is also required for weekend EOD support. 96
          OSS/OSO will facilitate obtaining 96 CES/CC approval for weekend EOD support.
   4.4.6. Missions requiring 96 CES EOD support on EOD training days will submit an ME
   request to 96 OSS/OSO for consideration. 96 OSS/OSO will coordinate the requests with 96
   OSS/CC and 96 CES/CC for approval.
   4.4.7. Missions requiring O&M Contractor support on maintenance down days will submit
   an ME request to 96 OSS/OSO for consideration. 96 OSS/OSO will coordinate the requests
   with 96 OSS/CC and O&M Contractor for approval.
4.5. 96th Test Wing/53d Wing Aircraft Schedules
   4.5.1. The following guidelines will be followed by all involved parties when formulating
   the aircraft utilization schedule, which includes scheduled/unscheduled aircraft maintenance,
   training sorties and flying/ground test missions for aircraft maintained by 96 MXG and
   operated by 53 WG/85 TES and 96 TW/40 FLTS. These guidelines are critical to stabilizing
   workload and maximizing resource utilization, including personnel, aircraft, consumables
   and range assets.
   4.5.2. Mission needs may require deviations from these guidelines. Changes to the daily
   aircraft utilization schedule require approval by the applicable Maintenance Production
   Supervisor and Flying Operations Supervisor. Conflicts will be resolved at the Maintenance
   Supervision and the Flying Operations Officer level. 96 TW priority will be used as the
   guideline when canceling/non-scheduling missions.
   4.5.3. Standard Flying Window.
      4.5.3.1. The standard aircraft flying window supported by the 40 FLTS and 85 TES will
      be 10 hours from first takeoff to last landing. Ground mount times will be included as
      well. The maximum window will be 12 hours unless coordinated through 96 MXG/CC
      and 96 OG/CC. No less than 12 hours of aircraft maintenance down time will be
      provided (last landing to first scheduled takeoff for the following duty day).
   4.5.4. Standard Turn Times.
      4.5.4.1. Standard turn times are defined as the time required to prepare aircraft for next
      flight (time between scheduled landing and next takeoff). The turn time includes minor
      maintenance inspections, servicing, ARDS/P5 pod upload and/or download, and
      chaff/flare upload, if applicable, and “Crew Ready” status 50 minutes prior to takeoff.
      The standard turn time does not include munitions load/unload or major aircraft
      reconfigurations.
          4.5.4.1.1. Three hours (2.5 hours minimum during surge operations):
              4.5.4.1.1.1. F-16A-D
24                                                  EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


             4.5.4.1.1.2. F-15C/D/E
             4.5.4.1.1.3. A-10C
         4.5.4.1.2. Two hours: UH-1
  4.5.5. Night Flying
     4.5.5.1. Night flying requirements will be planned and coordinated by 96 AMXS, 85
     TES, 40 FLTS, and communicated to 96 OSS/OSO personnel as far in advance as
     practical, but not less than two months in advance. 96 OSS/OSO will brief first
     takeoff/last landing times of the night flying window at the Wednesday 96 OSS/OSO
     scheduling meeting at least two weeks prior to the night flying mission week.
  4.5.6. Aircraft Deployments.
     4.5.6.1. Aircraft Deployments, Cross-Country, and Out & Back missions will be
     coordinated at least one week in advance and preferably one month. Aircraft
     Deployments involve flights that take-off and land from the deployed location. Cross-
     Country missions involve a series of flights, each of which take-off and land at different
     locations. Out & Back missions are Cross-Country missions that depart from and arrive at
     the home station on the same duty day, no matter how many stops are made in between.
     Departures and returns will be scheduled on normal duty days unless pre-coordinated
     with 96 AMXS. Do not schedule aircraft for test/training missions on the first duty day
     following a Deployment or Cross-Country of three or more days without prior approval
     from 96 AMXS. Do not schedule aircraft for test/training missions the day prior to a
     deployment (depending on duration). Test and training missions may be scheduled the
     day prior to an Out & Back sortie.
  4.5.7. 96 TW Training Days.
         4.5.7.1.1. These are days designated for aircrew or maintenance personnel training.
         Operations and Maintenance training have equal priority. Required scheduled
         maintenance should not be accomplished to the maximum extent possible on these
         days. Quick Reaction Testing and tests granted Management Emphasis take
         precedence over all training activities on these days.
     4.5.8.1. Aircraft Configuration (Munitions/Fuel/Software).
         4.5.8.1.1. When scheduling missions, make every effort to minimize aircraft
         configuration changes between “Go’s” (coordinate requirements for next scheduled
         sortie with 96 AMXS Production Supervisors).
  4.5.9. Do not accomplish major munitions and aircraft reconfigurations (e.g., external tanks,
  pods, Alternate Mission Equipment (AME) and software changes) between “Go’s” without
  prior 96 AMXS/MXA approval.           Major aircraft reconfigurations will require sufficient
  aircraft down time to accomplish the reconfiguration.
  4.5.10. Aircraft Scheduling Baseline (ASB).
     4.5.10.1. 96 MXG ASB indicates the maximum number of aircraft (per Mission Design
     Series) that 96 MXG will schedule on a regular basis (includes flyers, spares, ground
     mounts, and XC or deployed aircraft). The ASB for F-16 and F-15 aircraft are included
     in Table 1 below and will be used by 96 OSS/OSO to build the upcoming schedule.
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                             25


      These numbers are based on historical sortie generation rates. The monthly sortie
      production contract will be the final document that addresses the contracted and
      scheduled sorties for each month.

Table 4.1. Aircraft Scheduling Baseline (ASB)


                                      DT        OT        Total

                            F-16      6         4         10

                            F-15      5         4         9

   4.5.11. Due to the small number of A-10C and UH-1N aircraft they cannot be scheduled in
   the same manner as F-16 and F-15 aircraft. Each of these assets will be scheduled for a
   maximum of four fly days per week.
      4.5.11.1. The monthly contracts will be developed per AFI 21-101, 7.7. and AFMCI 21-
      165, 7.7. 96 MXG P&S personnel, 96 AMXS AMU leadership, 40 FLTS schedulers, and
      85 TES schedulers will produce a draft monthly contract that incorporates monthly
      contracted sorties and hours, UTE Goal, monthly scheduled sorties and hours, UTE
      scheduled, the ASD, as well as the attrition rate. The draft monthly contracts will be
      presented to the 96 AMXS/MXA, the 85 TES/DO and the 40 FLTS/DO NLT second
      week of the month. This provides one week’s time for operations and mx to agree on the
      contract prior to the Monthly Scheduling meeting.
   4.5.12. Baselines are provided for the 96 TW and 53 WG portions of the overall baseline.
   During the weekly Wing Scheduling Meeting, the 96 MXG, 96 OG and 85 TES may reduce
   the ASB three weeks out, based on the predicted number of aircraft available. Aircraft
   considered not available are aircraft in depot status (such as DM or DO), aircraft in
   modification (BK status), awaiting major aircraft maintenance actions/decisions from AFMC
   (BT, BU, BR, BQ), time changes or other planned heavy maintenance/inspections (phase or
   TCTOs), or other factors which will keep an aircraft non mission capable for more than three
   weeks.
   4.5.13. After the weekly Wing Scheduling Meeting, the ASB for the next three weeks will
   be established and any changes to this ASB will reference section 4.7 for 2407 guidance.
   4.5.14. Deviations.
      4.5.14.1. Deviations will be recorded and managed IAW AFMCI 21-165, paragraphs
      3.3. through 3.7. Rather than score deviations from the previous day’s 96 TW Daily
      Operations Order, deviations will be scored based off of the signed 96 TW Aircraft
      Weekly Schedule. The 96 TW Daily Operations Order will still be the refinement of the
      Weekly Schedule and will be the final schedule for daily test, training, maintenance and
      flying activities.
 26                                                  EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


4.6. Replacement Missions/Configurations
   4.6.1. Minor changes may be made to the CSE Mission Request. 96 OSS/OSO schedulers
   have the option to require a new mission request be submitted if the change is of such an
   impact that a formal CSE replacement mission is necessary.
   4.6.2. CSE replacement configurations will be submitted to 96 OSS/OSO schedulers for
   major configuration changes. Minor configuration changes include changing and/or adding
   serial numbers, fuel loads, or configuration remarks will not require replacement
   configurations to be submitted, 96 OSS/OSO aircraft schedulers will make the changes in
   CSE. The aircraft scheduler will make the determination on the replacement submittal
   requirement based on the complexity and number of changes being requested. AF FORM
   2407 process rules, specified in paragraph 4.7, will apply.
4.7. AF FORM 2407 Process
   4.7.1. Requests for changes to the published 96 TW/53 WG weekly/daily aircraft flying
   schedule may require submittal of a new aircraft configuration. These will require an AF
   FORM 2407 IAW paragraphs 4.7.5. and 4.7.6. The following paragraphs define roles,
   responsibilities, and procedures for the 96 TW AF FORM 2407 process.
   4.7.2. The 96 TW AF FORM 2407 process begins when the 96 TW Aircraft Weekly
   Schedule is approved by the 96 TW/CC or designated representative (at the weekly Wing
   Scheduling Meeting.)
   4.7.3. Pen and ink changes (minor changes) may be made to the signed 96 TW Aircraft
   Weekly Schedule. Pen and ink changes will be submitted on an AF FORM 2407. Personnel
   submitting AF FORM 2407s for pen and ink changes will follow the procedures in AFMCI
   21-165, paragraph 2.6.2.1. Pen and ink changes are not to be used to re-write the schedule
   but to amend it due to minor errors. Some examples of minor errors may be correcting a
   missile serial number, matching fuel loads or software loads for the day or fixing
   configurations so a morning training line configuration matches the afternoon test
   configuration.
   4.7.4. After 1600 on Friday, pen and ink changes can no longer be made. Changes made to
   the approved 96 TW Aircraft Weekly Schedule will follow the procedures outlined in
   paragraph 4.7.5.
   4.7.5. The following reasons require an AF FORM 2407 to change the Weekly Schedule:
   Adding aircraft, increasing the number of sorties, increasing the flying window, or cancelling
   scheduled maintenance. For these four reasons only, the AF FORM 2407 needs to be
   approved by the 96 MXG/CC (or designated representative) and the 96 OG/CC (or
   designated representative) for 40 FLTS aircraft or 96 MXG/CC and 85 TES/CC (or
   designated representative) for 85 TES aircraft.
   4.7.6. The Weekly Schedule covers Monday through Friday.
      4.7.6.1. Some changes made to the Weekly Schedule outside of the 96 TW Daily
      Operations Order time period will require an AF FORM 2407, see paragraph 4.7.5. An
      example of this is on Monday a test engineer realizes another test sortie is needed on
      Thursday. Although this test sortie is outside the 72 hour 96 TW Daily Operations Order,
      it is adding a sortie, per paragraph 4.7.5, the test engineer must submit a 2407 to add the
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                                27


      sortie. Another example is the test engineer also realizes the required aircraft is not on
      the schedule for that day. The test engineer may submit one AF FORM 2407 to add the
      needed test sortie and request the needed aircraft added to the schedule as well. The CSE
      generated AF FORM 2407 allows for multiple changes on a single form.
   4.7.7. Not every change to the Weekly Schedule outside of the 96 TW Daily Operations
   Order requires an AF FORM 2407. As an example, if the test engineer on Monday wants to
   make a simple configuration change (such as changing a CATM-120 to a specific CATM-
   120 serial number), or a software change or a fuel load change, to an aircraft already on the
   schedule, then a AF FORM 2407 is not needed. The test engineer only needs to annotate the
   changes in CSE and notify the proper agencies of the change.
   4.7.8. All changes to the Weekly Schedule made within the 72 hour 96 TW Daily Operations
   Order require an AF FORM 2407. Paragraph 4.7.5. will be used to determine the level of
   approval of the AF FORM 2407. Some 2407s will be approved at the group level and others
   will be approved at the unit level.
   4.7.9. Exception.
      4.7.9.1. Changes to the original printed takeoff or landing time of 30 minutes or less or a
      change arising after the first crew ready time for the squadron's current day's scheduled
      flying window will not require an AF FORM 2407.
      4.7.9.2. All AF FORM 2407 changes, not specified in paragraph 4.7.5., after the final 96
      TW/53 WG daily aircraft flying schedule is published, which is after the 1430 daily
      aircraft maintenance meeting two duty days prior to mission execution will be approved
      by the affected squadron commander(s) (or designated representative).
   4.7.10. The 96 OSS/OSO schedulers will confirm the changes with all support agencies,
   once the changes are posted in CSE.
   4.7.11. The agency requesting the change initiates the AF FORM 2407 and coordinates it
   through the affected Pro Super, Operations Officers/MX SUPT, and required group staff
   agencies (e.g., 896 TSS, Munitions, Scheduling). The test engineer should also be included
   if he/she is not the initiator. All approval/coordination names, dates, times will be annotated
   on the AF FORM 2407.
   4.7.12. Complete the AF FORM 2407 in CSE. CSE will disseminate the form to all
   appropriate agencies. Telephone coordination is still required.
   4.7.13. 96 OSS/OSO schedulers will notify all support agencies listed on the CSE mission
   request of mission changes after the 96 TW Daily Operations Order has been published,
   regardless if a AF FORM 2407 is required or not. 96 OSS/OSO schedulers may use the
   completed AF FORM 2407 to meet some or all of the notification requirements in order to
   prevent duplicate coordination.
4.8. Scheduling Munitions Support
   4.8.1. This section establishes procedures for obtaining 96 Maintenance Squadron (96 MXS)
   Munitions Flight support and munitions using the CSE Mission Request.
   4.8.2. Test engineers and schedulers submitting CSE missions for munitions support must be
   familiar with and ensure compliance with the following directives:
 28                                                   EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


      4.8.2.1. AFI 21-201, Management and Maintenance of Non-Nuclear Munitions .
      4.8.2.2. 96 TWI 21-101, Local Technical Order Writing Procedures.
      4.8.2.3. 96 TWI 21-202, Munitions Technical Data.
   4.8.3. CSE mission submitters must ensure the JON that missions are submitted against have
   an allocation for the desired munitions prior to mission submittal. Any allocation shortages
   must be resolved by the CSE Munitions Organization Manager.
   4.8.4. CSE Organization Managers are responsible for accomplishing JON transfers in CSE.
   Organization Managers can only move allocations between JONs under their organization.
   To transfer from one organization to another requires coordination with the 96 MXS
   Munitions Accountability Element.
   4.8.5. CSE Organization Managers coordinate with other Organization Managers to co-
   allocate non-expendable asset(s), such as captive carry missiles, inert General Purpose
   Bombs, etc. Organization Managers can only co-allocate assets that are issued to their
   organization/JON. Once the Organization Managers agree on the co-allocation, the owning
   Organization Manager accomplishes the co-allocation in CSE.
   4.8.6. Munitions build missions must be submitted five duty days prior to a delivery mission.
   4.8.7. Mission submitters must ensure munitions selected on CSE delivery missions have an
   on-hand quantity in CSE. Although the CSE software allows mission submitters to select
   munitions with zero (0) on-hand balances, the munitions assets are not available for use and
   will not be delivered. Any on-hand shortages will be resolved by the CSE Organization
   Manager.
   4.8.8. Munitions Control is the focal point for all munitions support/mission issues.
4.9. Scheduling Ambulance Support
   4.9.1. Missions requiring 96 MDG Emergency Department support (ambulance) will be
   coordinated with the 96 MDG Emergency Departments. The Emergency Departments will,
   on average, provide medical coverage for two range missions per day. These missions will
   be covered by level of priority. The Eglin Emergency Departments will work with 96
   OSS/OSO range schedulers to try and ensure the missions are covered to prevent any
   cancellations. Missions should be scheduled as far in advance as possible to allow the
   movement of staff schedules to coincide with the mission coverage.
4.10. Shared Range Space Utilization (SRSU)
   4.10.1. The following procedure describes the process to schedule and utilize shared air
   and/or ground space for separate but compatible missions. These procedures are applicable
   to all Eglin range users conducting test and/or training missions.
      4.10.1.1. Missions that may qualify for shared range space use will be identified by 96
      OSS/OSO schedulers during the scheduling process. 96 OSS/OSO schedulers will notify
      the mission requester of the lower priority mission that shared range space is a possibility
      and will place the mission on “range space alert.” Every effort will be made to de-
      conflict by time, space, and/or altitude prior to generating any SRSU.
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                                29


     4.10.1.2. 96 OSS/OSO, after a management review, will send the SRSU agreement
     template, via CSE, to the lower priority mission POC, who is responsible for ensuring the
     coordination is completed and submitted to the CAMMP for Air Traffic Control (ATC)
     approval. Every effort should be made to complete the process by COB, two duty days
     prior to mission execution. However, if the agreement is not reached prior to 1200L on
     the duty day prior to mission execution day, the lower priority mission will be non-
     scheduled. In order to cut down on the overall number of SRSUs in the system, 96
     OSS/OSO may elect to send the SRSU to a higher priority mission POC if warranted. An
     example would be a higher priority mission sharing with five lower priority missions,
     instead of five separate SRSUs being generated, a single SRSU would be sent to the
     higher priority mission. The higher priority mission would still have the priority when
     generating the sharing agreements.
     4.10.1.3. The coordination/analysis should be conducted face-to-face between both
     mission POCs and aircrews if feasible, otherwise telephone and e-mail is acceptable.
     Regardless of how coordination is accomplished, mission POCs are responsible for
     ensuring aircrews and ground personnel are fully briefed on how the missions will safely
     operate concurrently. Priority is not to be used as a determining factor as to feasibility of
     shared airspace use. Safety considerations may require a review by the appropriate safety
     personnel.
     4.10.1.4. Mission information for affected missions will be generated by CSE. Each
     mission POC will indicate that they have discussed the de-confliction procedures signing
     off in the appropriate area on the CSE SRSU.
     4.10.1.5. The large block at the bottom of the form will be used by the mission POC to
     describe specific details concerning how the missions have been de-conflicted (e.g.,
     mission #1 will remain south of range road ###, mission #2 will remain below XXX
     AGL).      A detailed and complete description of all agreements must be entered.
     Generalized statements such as “de-confliction will be made real-time” or simply “will
     avoid each other" are not acceptable; you must state specifically how de-confliction will
     occur.
     4.10.1.6. After all coordination is properly accomplished with the higher priority
     missions, the lowest priority POC will submit the completed SRSU to the CAMMP, 96
     OSS/OSAA. The CAMMP (i.e., ATC), will review the SRSU and either approve or
     disapprove.
     4.10.1.7. During the mission pre-briefs, the respective TE/Project Officer (PO)/Mission
     Officer In Charge (OIC) and aircrew will cover all aspects of the SRSU agreement. If
     questions arise as to the ability to safely conduct either mission, an attempt will be made
     to resolve the conflicts. If there is not sufficient time or the conflicts cannot be resolved
     by 30 minutes prior to take-off time, the lower priority mission will be canceled for
     airspace conflict.
     4.10.1.8. 96 OSS/OSO will ensure O&M range personnel on manned ranges have access
     to SRSU information. For ground test and training on O&M Contractor manned ranges,
     the appropriate mission POC should brief O&M Contractor personnel.
 30                                                 EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


      4.10.1.9. The ERCF/EMC is not responsible to ensure aircrews entering shared airspace
      understand the SRSU agreement.
   4.10.2. In order to avoid having to process recurring agreements over and over,
   programs/units may elect to participate in the SRSU Pre-Agreement program where they can
   identify agreements for specific range air and/or ground space conflicts in advance. For all
   approved pre-agreements, 96 OSS/OSO will generate, sign off, and approve the SRSU
   without each mission POC having to go into CSE and individually sign and/or submit to
   ATC review/approval. Mission POCs will receive an email showing that the SRSU has been
   generated and approved. Mission POCs will still be required to ensure all aircrews and/or
   appropriate ground support personal are briefed on the agreement. Contact 96 OSS/OSO
   Scheduling Office to participate.
4.11. Scheduling Supersonic Flights Over Land Ranges
   4.11.1. To minimize the adverse effects of sonic booms on the civilian populace, the
   following procedures will be followed:
      4.11.1.1. Only B-70 is approved for supersonic flight tests over land below FL300.
      Supersonic flights will be flown IAW EAFBI 11-201.
      4.11.1.2. All supersonic missions over B-70 will be scheduled using the normal CSE
      scheduling cycle. NO BLACKBOARDS unless approved by 96 OSS/CC.
      4.11.1.3. On the CSE Mission Request, a supersonic flight mission request must be
      clearly indicated. Request a supersonic flight mission only if it is truly needed.
      4.11.1.4. The mission requester will request two communication vans (VANCOMM) in
      the CSE Mission Request, Range Support, and one hand-held sound level meter for each
      van. One van will be stationed at the intersection of Highway 87 and Wells Rd (5.7 miles
      North of Highway 98). The other van will be placed at the fire station on Beal Parkway
      in Wright. Each van must have radio communications directly to B-75 Control or be able
      to have information relayed to the Central Control Facility (CCF).
      4.11.1.5. The mission requester, or his alternate, must plan to be on site to check radio
      communications with the communication vans well ahead of scheduled take-off time.
      The van located at the intersection of Highway 87 and Wells Rd is the more important of
      the two and is a go-no-go item. The van located at the fire station on Beal Parkway in
      Wright, while highly desirable, is not a no-go resource.
      4.11.1.6. Prior to the mission, during the communications check, the procedures must be
      checked with the personnel in the vans. These procedures call for the personnel in each
      van to radio the dB reading from the sound meter and subjective evaluation of the effects
      of the sonic boom to the mission requester immediately after each pass.
      4.11.1.7. Supersonic flights over the Warning/Water ranges will be flown IAW EAFBI
      11-201, Air Operations.
4.12. Quiet Period
   4.12.1. Request for quiet periods on the Eglin flightline requires coordination with the 96
   OSS/DO. Requests should be made IAW EAFBI 11-201.
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                               31


4.13. Road Closures
   4.13.1. Road closures on the Eglin Reservation occur on a daily basis. In an effort to prevent
   an accident or serious injury, individuals should not attempt to go around closed gates or
   roadblocks. Contact the JTTOCC or Range Supervisor prior to going through ANY closed
   gate.
   4.13.2. The 96 SFS will ensure traffic is blocked to those portions of state and county roads
   that fall within an active safety profile or as deemed necessary by 96 TW Range Safety. If a
   state/county road is required to be closed for a mission, 96 OSS/OSO will notify Public
   Affairs (96 TW/PA), Fire Department (96 CEG/CEF), and 96 SFS prior to the day of the
   test/training event.
   4.13.3. 96 OSS/OSO will distribute a road closure schedule and update as changes occur.
   Contact 96 OSS/OSO to be added to the road closure notice distribution list.
   4.13.4. The test area supervisor is responsible for blocking range roads impacted by safety
   profiles. This will be done by closing and securing road gates and/or setting up temporary
   roadblocks. The test area supervisor will ensure the test area is clear of all unauthorized
   personnel.
   4.13.5. Blocking of roads by training units is prohibited. If temporary roadblocks are
   required during a mission an approval request must be submitted through 96 OSS/OSPJ.
   4.13.6. There may be times where missions will be delayed to allow school buses to transit
   back and forth to the 6 RTB Ranger Camp. Contact 96 OSS/OSOS for normal school bus
   times to/from the 6 RTB Ranger Camp.
4.14. Open Skies Treaty
   4.14.1. Open Skies Treaty Missions, when approved, are authorized to over fly test ranges in
   the US on coordinated dates/times and are controlled from Washington, D.C. Typically, the
   initial notification will be received at Eglin will vary from NLT 72 hours to one month prior
   to the planned over flight dates. At that time, an electronic message will be sent to the Open
   Skies POCs in the organizations. The organization POCs have approximately 23 hours from
   the time of the initial message to identify high-value activities and send an impact statement
   to 96 OSS/OSO for forwarding to the Eglin Open Skies POC. On Execution Day, terms of
   the treaty stipulate airspace must be cleared of mission aircraft 50KM either side of Open
   Skies aircraft track, 15 minutes before and after entry into Eglin airspace.
   4.14.2. Definition of High-Value Activity:
      4.14.2.1. Any activity that will incur substantial monetary cost if postponed or cancelled.
      4.14.2.2. Cannot be concealed and reveals national security information, if observed.
      4.14.2.3. Takes advantage of a unique set of chronological or meteorological
      circumstances which cannot be duplicated.
      4.14.2.4. The installation Open Skies POC believes special circumstances apply.
   4.14.3. If the activity is determined by the organization Open Skies POC to be a high-value
   activity, the following information must be included in the Open Skies impact statement:
      4.14.3.1. Point of Contact.
32                                                 EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


     4.14.3.2. Office Symbol/Address.
     4.14.3.3. DSN/Commercial Phone Number.
     4.14.3.4. What the activity is.
     4.14.3.5. When (Date/time of the activity).
     4.14.3.6. Where (Coordination required).
     4.14.3.7. Why it cannot be postponed.

                                          Chapter 5

                                MISSION COORDINATION

5.1. 96 TW Daily Operations Order
   5.1.1. 96 OSS/OSO schedulers will publish the 96 TW Daily Operations Order three duty
   days prior to execution day. The cutoff is 1500L for changes prior to the 96 TW Daily
   Operations Order being published at 1600L. All changes after 1500L may not be published
   but will be reflected in CSE. All changes coordinated through 96 OSS/OSO schedulers after
   the 96 TW Daily Operations Order publishing will be confirmed via telephone with the
   appropriate support agency. Mission changes occurring after 1600L on the duty day prior to
   mission execution may not be confirmed until the following duty day. Saturday and Sunday
   missions are included with the Friday schedule.
   5.1.2. 96 TW Daily Operations Order Quality Review. All requesting and support
   organizations will conduct a quality review of the upcoming 96 TW Daily Operations Order
   that will be published. The review will include specific aircraft configurations and munitions
   requested. The review must be completed NLT 1100 hours on the day the 96 TW Daily
   Operations Order is published. Every effort will be made to confirm the resources scheduled
   will meet the individual mission requirements and that all support agencies can support those
   requirements. As a minimum, the following requesting and support agencies are required to
   conduct the organizational quality review:
       5.1.2.1. Requesting Agencies are 40 FLTS, 413 FLTS, 780 TS, 46 TS, 96 OSS/OSPA ,
       96 OSS/OSPJ, OFP/CTF, 85 TES, 28 TES, 53 WEG, 33 FW, 1 SOW, 24 SOW, 325 FW,
       6 RTB, Naval EOD School, 18 FLTS, AFRL, and 7SFG(A).
       5.1.2.2. Supporting Agencies are 96 AMXS Blue, 96 AMXS Red, O&M Contractor,
       Munitions Control, 896 TSS, LSC, EOD, Ambulance Support, ATC/CAMMP, 96 RNCS
       (CCF), FCA, and Eglin Fire Department.
   5.1.3. Mission changes after the 96 TW Daily Operations Order is published require
   significantly more coordination and manpower, thus it is vital that a thorough quality review
   is conducted prior to publishing and that required changes are passed to schedulers with
   enough time to complete prior to publishing.
5.2. Mission Profiles
   5.2.1. A properly coordinated and approved profile for the specified project must be in CSE
   before scheduling a mission using land ranges. Airborne missions that cannot conform to the
   approved profile will be terminated by the JTTOCC MMS if the deviation cannot be
   approved real-time. Procedures for submitting and obtaining approval of profiles are in
   Chapter 7.
5.3. Operational Requirements
   5.3.1. Operating on/in Eglin Land/Water Ranges and Test Areas. Air Traffic Control and
   flying operations within the Eglin range/test areas will be IAW EAFBI 11-201. Range
   operations and planning will be IAW EAFBI 13-212.
 34                                                  EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


   5.3.2. Ordnance Expenditure/Laser Operations/Hazardous Activity Criteria. No ordnance
   expenditure, laser operations, or other hazardous activity will commence on any test
   area/range without clearance through two-way radio contact from the Range Control
   Authority. No ground mission will go hot on any range until the appropriate Range Control
   Authority has received approval from the JTTOCC/MMS. The Range Control Authority will
   also notify the JTTOCC/MMS upon completion of activity. EMC is not a Range Control
   Authority for the purpose of approving ordinance expenditures.
5.4. Unmanned Test Areas/Ranges
   5.4.1. Ground Missions.
      5.4.1.1. Ground missions expending ordnance, conducting laser operations, or other
      hazardous activities on unmanned test areas/ranges (A-77, A-78, A-73, A-79, and B-7),
      will contact Wolfcall (JTTOCC) via Radio/LMR or telephone (secondary) and obtain
      clearance prior to expenditure of ordnance or going "hot.” The appointed Range Safety
      officer for the training operation will ensure the area is clear and conditions established
      by 96 TW/SE in the Test Directive Safety Appendix have been complied with before
      requesting a clearance.
      5.4.1.2. For hot ground missions on unmanned ranges, the test engineer or designated
      representative must maintain two-way contact with the JTTOCC/MMS at all times, and
      must advise the JTTOCC/MMS prior to going hot and when the area is cold.
   5.4.2. Air Missions.
      5.4.2.1. Aircraft will contact EMC for clearance into the restricted area prior to entry.
      Restricted area clearance is not permission to expend ordnance on the test area. All
      aircraft expending ordnance, conducting laser operations or other hazardous activities on
      unmanned test areas/ranges (A-77, A-78, A-73, A-79, and B-7) will check in/out for
      clearance with Wolfcall (JTTOCC). Initial clearance to expend ordnance will be given by
      Wolfcall (JTTOCC). After initial clearance is received, aircraft will return to mission
      frequency and advise mission control on termination of ordnance delivery. Aircraft will
      notify JTTOCC/MMS when ordnance delivery is complete. Air missions dispensing
      ordnance during instrument conditions (visual contact with the target not possible or
      required) on land ranges must be coordinated with the Chief of Safety (96 TW/SE) before
      the mission can be conducted.
      5.4.2.2. Scheduled UAV activity should contact the JTTOCC/MMS for activation of
      scheduled airspace and notify the JTTOCC/MMS when mission is complete.
5.5. Manned Test Area/Ranges
   5.5.1. Aircraft will contact EMC for clearance into the restricted area prior to entry.
   Restricted area clearance is not permission to expend ordnance on the test area. Air missions
   expending ordnance, conducting laser operations or other hazardous activities on any manned
   test area/range will establish and maintain positive radio contact with the Test Area
   Controller and obtain clearance prior to commencing any hot activity. In the event positive
   contact with the Test Area Controller cannot be established and/or maintained, air missions
   will contact Wolfcall (JTTOCC/MMS) for assistance. EMC does not have approval authority
   for hazardous activity.
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                                 35


   5.5.2. For ground detonations, laser operations, or other hazardous activity, the test area
   supervisor must obtain clearance from the JTTOCC/MMS. The JTTOCC/MMS will
   coordinate with EMC to sterilize the required vertical airspace. If air missions are being
   conducted within the requested vertical airspace, final decision on priority will be made by
   the JTTOCC Supervisor. The test area supervisor will:
      5.5.2.1. Ensure the area is clear and conditions established by 96 TW/SE in the Test
      Directive Safety Appendix have been complied with before requesting a clearance.
      5.5.2.2. Notify the JTTOCC/MMS when the detonation, laser operations, or other
      hazardous activity is complete. JTTOCC/MMS will in turn notify EMC.
   5.5.3. Any person or group not officially assigned duty at a land test area, or not supporting a
   scheduled mission, must have a “Z clearance” before entering a closed area or unmanned
   range. Procedures for obtaining Z clearances are in Chapter 9.
   5.5.4. Ground parties scheduled at Test Area B-6 will check with 6 RTB operations prior to
   conducting test/training activity.
5.6. Changes in Mission Status/Alerts
   5.6.1. The JTTOCC (RCS and MMS) is the coordinating agency for changes to the 96 TW
   Daily Operations Order after 1600L, the duty day prior to mission execution. The final
   determination concerning holds, mission extensions, test area usage, test area times,
   separation criteria, test area restrictions, altitudes, support changes, alerts, overtime, and
   cancellations will be coordinated by the JTTOCC (RCS and MMS). All changes will be
   coordinated with the TE/Project Officer (PO)/Mission OIC involved, but the 96 OSS/OSO
   has final authority to alter, cancel, add, hold, delay, or otherwise change the 96 TW Daily
   Operations Order.
   5.6.2. Missions on alert status are missions that have not been finalized because one or more
   of the following conditions exist. The mission alert condition, in most cases, must be
   resolved by 1200L one duty day prior to mission execution. The mission will not be allowed
   to execute while in a mission alert status.
      5.6.2.1. Briefing Alert (O&M Contractor Briefing Alert (CBA), EOD, 96 CEG, 96
      OSS/OSO, etc.) is activated by the O&M Contractor Plans Office, or requesting support
      agency, when mission information such as range altitude, corridor altitude, and aircraft
      call sign/tail number has not been included on CSE Mission Request, or a 96 TW activity
      (or O&M contractor) has not received the required briefing on mission requirements.
      5.6.2.2. O&M Contractor Resources Alert. Activated by the O&M Contractor Plans
      Office when the appropriate resources are not available to support the mission or the TD
      has not authorized the required resources.
      5.6.2.3. Maintenance Alert (Aircraft MX Alert) is activated by the O&M aircraft
      scheduler or the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) when an aircraft is out of
      commission and may not meet the scheduled take-off time/mission time. The aircraft
      estimated time of completion (ETIC) will be included when placing the mission on alert.
      5.6.2.4. Frequency Control and Analysis Alert (FCA Alert) is activated by 96
      OSS/OSOQ when a briefing has not been received on missions requiring FCA facilities, a
36                                                  EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


     RFA has not been issued or unauthorized interference would occur based on analysis of a
     mission's electromagnetic environment.
     5.6.2.5. Setup Alert is activated by any support agency/activity when pre-mission setup
     requirements have not been completed (e.g., O&M contractor high-speed camera setup
     delayed due to weather).
     5.6.2.6. Allocations Alert (Munitions) is activated by 96 MXS/LGMW when required
     munitions have not been received or allocated to a specific project or for working invalid
     munitions requests.
     5.6.2.7. Safety Alert is activated by 96 TW/SE or any other responsible activity/agency
     when a valid safety solution has not been issued or received or when any other unsafe
     condition exists. 96 TW/SE or the activating activity/agency with concurrence from 96
     TW/SE resolves the alert when conditions causing the alert have been eliminated.
     5.6.2.8. EOD Alert is activated by Explosive Ordnance Disposal Flight (96 CEG/CED)
     when the necessary test directive, manufacturer's technical data, or technical order is not
     available in sufficient time to train and brief personnel on test munitions, when written
     changes to support requirements have not been coordinated or received, when changes in
     mission support requirements necessitate writing or rewriting an operating instruction, or
     when required checklists are not complete or suspected of being in error.
     5.6.2.9. Technical Data Alert is activated by the 96 MXS/LGMW when current
     munitions data has not been supplied or activated by 96 OG/OGVW when proper
     munitions/stores loading procedures have not been established.
     5.6.2.10. Test/Training Directive Alert.      O&M scheduler activates Test/Training
     Directive Alert when the directive has not been properly coordinated or signed.
     5.6.2.11. Range Space Alert. O&M scheduler activates airspace Alert when missions
     have not yet completed SRSU checklists approved by ATC.
  5.6.3. Preventing Alerts. The test engineer can prevent most alerts by ensuring the following:
     5.6.3.1. The 96 TW test directive and changes to support requirements are in the hands
     of all support activities/agencies concerned.
     5.6.3.2. The appropriate O&M Contractor Plans Office representative, 96 CEG, and
     EOD personnel are briefed no later than 1000L hours the day before mission execution.
     5.6.3.3. The profile is on file with the O&M Contractor.
     5.6.3.4. Requested munitions have been allocated, built-up, and are in CSE prior to
     mission submittal.
     5.6.3.5. Approved checklists are developed, coordinated and available to squadron
     weapons loading, maintenance personnel and aircrews.
  5.6.4. 96 OSS/OSO schedulers will consider mission change requests only from the person
  designated on the CSE Mission Request, the list of responsible POC’s for a specific JON
  listed in CSE under Mission Support/JONs/Mission Submitters, or from designated liaison
  offices or control activities/agencies within an organization. Mission submitters will make
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                               37


   every effort to accurately preplan their mission before submitting requests and ensure
   accurate POC information is reflected on the CSE mission request.
   5.6.5. All requests for mission changes are accepted on a tentative basis subject to
   confirmation that all agencies involved can support the proposed mission change. Under
   certain conditions, 96 OSS/OSO schedulers may request a replacement mission.
   Replacement missions may be required when there are changes to munitions federal stock
   numbers, changes too numerous to annotate on the present form, or a change is made from a
   cold to a hot mission after the 96 TW Daily Operations Order is published.
   5.6.6. The CSE Mission Request is a historical documentation of the mission. 96 OSS/OSO
   schedulers will make the following notations regarding mission changes on the CSE Mission
   Request form (after 96 TW Daily Operations Order publishing):
      5.6.6.1. Type or nature of change.
      5.6.6.2. Name of individual requesting the change.
      5.6.6.3. Date and time change was made.
      5.6.6.4. Personnel/agencies notified of change.
   5.6.7. If a mission is ground aborted or canceled, a failure or cancellation code will be
   assigned and noted on the CSE Mission Request. In the event of disagreements over the
   failure/cancellation codes, the test engineer, in concert with 96 OSS/OSO, will make the final
   determination. The authorized codes and reasons for failure or cancellation will be entered
   on the CSE PMR (see Attachment 2). Up to three codes may be assigned with the sum of the
   percentages totaling 100%.
5.7. Fire Danger Conditions
   5.7.1. The following are mission restrictions and suppression considerations based on the
   Fire Danger:
      5.7.1.1. Fire Danger Low. No restrictions on missions. No difficulty in control or mop-
      up expected.
      5.7.1.2. Fire Danger Moderate. No restrictions on pyrotechnics. A fire watch is
      required to be posted for a minimum of 20 minutes after use of pyrotechnics has been
      completed. Little difficulty in control or mop-up expected.
      5.7.1.3. Fire Danger High. Use caution with pyrotechnics and post a fire watch for a
      minimum of 30 minutes after use of pyrotechnics has been completed. Extra precautions
      required for campfires. Control of wildfires through direct attack may be difficult, and
      mop up efforts become more time consuming.
      5.7.1.4. Fire Danger Very High. Restrict pyrotechnics to hand-thrown simulators or
      smoke grenades, no tracers authorized. NO FLARES below 1000 AGL. Use simulators
      or grenades only on roads or in pits. Cleared areas for pyrotechnics should be a
      minimum of 1.5 times the blast radius. No campfires on Eglin. High intensity burning
      will make control significantly more difficult. Fires can spread rapidly and require
      significant resources for control and mop up. Aircraft are more likely to be used in
      suppression efforts, interfering with airspace and/or mission activity.
 38                                                   EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


      5.7.1.5. Fire Danger Extreme. NO PYROTECHNICS allowed without prior approval
      from the Wildland Fire Program Manager or their designee at the AF Wildland Fire
      Center located at Jackson Guard. Expect extreme, erratic fire behavior. 100%
      commitment of AF Wildland Fire Center Firefighters and presence of outside agencies,
      including various fire suppression aircraft is likely. Air space restrictions are likely to be
      in place at fire scene(s).
   5.7.2. 96 OSS/OSO will review all overland hot mission activity with Jackson Guard the
   duty day prior and place the appropriate missions Safety Alert. If the mission activity is
   deemed unsafe and the risk of starting a fire cannot be mitigated, the mission will be
   cancelled on execution day by the JTTOCC/RCS.
   5.7.3. Mission personnel must report all mission caused wildfires to the JTTOCC as soon as
   possible so that the JTTOCC can notify the Jackson Guard AF Wildland Fire Center.
   Wildfires on known UXO contaminated ranges, A-77/A-78/A-79/B-7, C52N/W, C-62, and
   C-72 will be reported to the JTTOCC . The JTTOCC will coordinate with EOD and Jackson
   Guard to close the range and ensure evacuation of all personnel for max fragmentation
   distances. The JTTOCC will place all appropriate missions on alert and not allow any
   mission activity until cleared to do so by EOD and Jackson Guard.
5.8. Transient Aircraft Parking Areas
   5.8.1. The test engineer/project office will coordinate any special aircraft parking needs with
   96 OSS/OSA Eglin Airfield Manager and 96 OSS/OSX (Operations Plans Flight). This
   coordination must be effected for any missions requiring parking in areas other than the 96
   TW ramp or Gunline 1 or 3.
5.9. Business Effort Tanker Program
   5.9.1. The 96 OSS/OSO is the central point of contact for tanker crews TDY to Eglin AFB
   in support of Eglin test missions.
      5.9.1.1. Occasionally, tankers may be TDY to Eglin to support organizations other than
      the 96 TW (e.g., 33 FW, 53 WG, etc.). Use of these tankers must be coordinated with the
      appropriate organization's scheduling office.
5.10. Coordination with 20 SPCS to Penetrate R2917/SPADATS Airspace
   5.10.1. Mission re-distribution coordination can take up to several weeks, and if approved,
   remains subject to real-time cancellation by US Strategic Command Mission Directors. To
   acquire permission to penetrate R-2917 and avoid inadvertent Electrical Explosive Device
   (EED) activation, potential loss of life, and critical flight resources, the following actions
   must be completed:
      5.10.1.1. NLT fourty-five days before planned mission, the test engineer will advise 20
      SPCS/DO of intention to penetrate R-2917. Include date, time, and duration of each
      penetration.
      5.10.1.2. The 20 SPCS/DO will review scheduled radar activity and request downtime
      from the controlling agency to support the mission.
      5.10.1.3. Upon controlling agency response, 20 SPCS/DO will inform 96 OSS/OSO of
      the unit’s support posture and limiting factors that may exist.
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                                 39


      5.10.1.4. On Execution Day, the CCF will establish a real-time command and control
      link with the 20 SPCS Mission Operations Center (MOC) to ensure positive control and
      coordination of aircraft movement and radar status. The real-time C2 link with 20 SPCS
      will be established NLT 45 minutes prior to penetration of R-2917 airspace.
5.11. Frequency Control and Analysis
   5.11.1. The 96th Range Support Squadron (RANSS) FCA facilities (TS A-6 & TS D-3) and
   mobile van are established to monitor and record those signals identified as critical to the
   conduct of a mission and to detect, analyze, locate, and record extraneous signals that may
   interfere with the mission IAW AFI 33-580 and EAFB Supp 1. The 96 RANSS fixed and
   mobile FCA facilities monitor the frequency bands between 20 MHz and 18 GHz with
   limited capability up to 40 GHz.
   5.11.2. The systems provide 96 TW with a quick-reaction capability to locate unauthorized
   radiation that may have adverse effects on test missions or other electromagnetic operations.
   Results of mission frequency monitoring are delivered to the 96 RANSS FCA Range
   Engineer, 96 OSS FCA office, and the GAFC Office upon request for review and cataloging.
   Unauthorized signals can be identified, located, and appropriate action initiated for
   elimination.
   5.11.3. Radio frequency interference (RFI) will be investigated to the maximum extent
   possible in real-time, with the intent of eliminating the interfering source. All investigations
   and attempts to identify and eliminate the RFI to scheduled test missions will be coordinated
   with the GAFC Office as soon as possible. However, real-time investigation and elimination
   of the RFI source by 96 OSS FCA personnel will continue and not be delayed while awaiting
   contact with GAFC Office. In the event that RFI is suspected or identified from an off Eglin
   source, a commercial/ civilian system, or a system other than a 96 TW resource, the GAFC
   Office shall be contacted immediately and the investigation will proceed with the GAFC
   Office as lead.
   5.11.4. All chaff and ECM conducted in Eglin AFB airspace will be according to EAFBI 11-
   201 and the applicable project RFA.
5.12. Natural Resources Section (Jackson Guard) (96 CEG/CEV)
   5.12.1. For missions with the potential to negatively impact threatened and endangered
   species, protected by federal law, Jackson Guard will brief personnel and their contractor(s)
   on all legally binding terms and conditions. Jackson Guard will ensure conditions and
   restrictions regarding biological resources are available to key personnel in verbal or written
   form and will provide maps when necessary. The appropriate mission personnel will be
   given an environmental guidebook identifying all protected species and sensitive habitats
   along with their associated compliance requirements.        If impacts to protected species or
   sightings of very rare species are documented mission personnel will call Jackson Guard as
   soon as possible to report the sighting or incident (882-4164, 883-1153, or 882-8421).
 40                                                   EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


                                          Chapter 6

                                   MISSION CONTROL

6.1. Joint Test and Training Operations Control Center (JTTOCC)/Radio Call Sign
" Wolfcall"
   6.1.1. The JTTOCC (RCS and MMS) is the single point of contact for execution day air and
   ground mission management and coordination to include all scheduled mission changes.
   Test engineers and/or training mission POCs are required to report mission status changes to
   the JTTOCC RCS as soon as possible. The JTTOCC consists of two sections: 1) Mission
   Management Section (MMS), and 2) Resource Coordination Section (RCS). MMS
   “Wolfcall” may be contacted on UHF 276.0.
6.2. Central Control Facility (CCF)
   6.2.1. The CCF (Radio Call Sign “Chamber”) provides real-time mission, test execution
   management, telemetry conversion, data collection, and data processing for specific missions
   that require its services. The test engineer, safety representative, mission director, and
   mission controller operate in this location when required.
   6.2.2. The 96 RNCS houses the CCF and provides mathematical, engineering, and analysis
   of test data from aircraft weapons, and C2 systems. Included in this is the development of
   software for target and drone control as well as modeling, simulation, and analysis expertise
   for surface to air threat systems.
6.3. Eglin Radar Control Facility (ERCF)
   6.3.1. The ERCF is divided into two co-located functions:
      6.3.1.1. Eglin Radar Approach Control (RAPCON). The RAPCON is responsible for
      providing terminal ATC services within designated airspace.
      6.3.1.2. EMC.
          6.3.1.2.1. EMC is responsible for the operational management and monitoring of
          mission aircraft/ground assets. EMC provides ATC services during ingress (prior to
          entering mission airspace) and egress (after exiting mission assigned airspace). Once
          established within mission airspace, EMC maintains airspace integrity for all non-
          participating aircraft.
6.4. EMC Operations
   6.4.1. The 96 OSS/OSO will provide EMC the schedule of mission activity for Eglin AFB
   restricted or warning area airspace.
   6.4.2. EMC will monitor mission aircraft operating within the confines of R-2914 A/B, R-
   2915 A/B/C, R-2918, R-2919 A/B, W-151, W-470, and airspace delegated/released by the
   ERCF.
   6.4.3. EMC will monitor all mission traffic, within equipment limitations, to support the
   Eglin range mission schedule, except when the pilot has been advised to maintain visual
   flight rules (VFR) while operating outside the limits of the special use airspace. It is the
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                                41


   pilot's responsibility to maintain VFR while operating outside the limits of airspace delegated
   to EMC and comply with FAA requirements.
6.5. Airspace Requirements
   6.5.1. Special Use Airspace (SUA) is the airspace controlled by the Federal Aviation
   Administration (FAA) and used by 96 TW. Specifically, Eglin SUA is R-2914 A/B, R-2915
   A/B/C, R-2918, R-2919 A/B, W-151, and W-470. Eglin SUA is requested and released by
   ERCF/EMC according to the Letter of Agreement (LOA) between the FAA and 96 TW.
   6.5.2. When Eglin SUA airspace is released to EMC, all aircraft must contact EMC prior to
   entering the airspace. Aircraft control procedures are outlined in EAFBI 11-201, Air
   Operations. When Eglin SUA is no longer needed by EMC for the purpose intended, it will
   be released to Eglin Radar Approach Control or to the FAA, whichever applies.
   6.5.3. The US Navy, Pensacola FL, schedules and controls Warning Area W-155. For 96
   TW missions requiring this airspace, 96 OSS/OSO schedulers will obtain approval from the
   Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility (FACSFAC), Pensacola Naval Air Station.
   6.5.4. Shoreline S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, and B1 water ranges are separately scheduled areas.
   Shoreline airspace S5, S6, and S7 are unique in that they are the only water ranges that also
   have associated approach control airspace within them. Scheduling these particular areas
   greatly affects the operational capabilities of the ERCF. Shoreline areas must be scheduled
   in conjunction with restricted areas and /or appropriate portions of W-151, unless otherwise
   coordinated through the CAMMP. These areas, below eleven thousand feet, will not
   normally be scheduled for training missions other than transient from land to water or water
   to land. W-151B1 is released to Tyndall RAPCON surface to flight level two three zero, but
   may be scheduled by 96 OSS/OSO or recalled by the JTTOCC/MMS for mission
   requirements. There may be times when all or part of requested Shoreline airspace is denied
   due to ATC and/or other mission constraints.
   6.5.5. Within the limits of its radar coverage and communications capability, EMC will
   provide radar advisories to mission aircraft. Mission aircraft will respond to overriding
   control instructions from EMC, regardless of which activity/agency may be controlling the
   mission.
   6.5.6. EMC has no authority with respect to airspace outside of designated restricted or
   warning areas that have not been made available to EMC for the purpose of conducting
   missions. When operating outside of 96 TW delegated airspace, restricted, and warning
   areas, mission pilots are responsible for proper flight planning IAW AFI 11-202V3, General
   Flight Rules, and compliance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs).
6.6. Missile Launches and Weapon Releases
   6.6.1. EAFBI 11-201 and the Test/Training Directive Safety Appendix outlines detailed
   responsibilities for 96 TW missile launches and weapon releases. EMC is responsible for
   airspace surveillance of warning areas designated by the safety officer during the time
   specified. The position, direction of travel, and approximate speed of any non-participating
   aircraft detected within the designated warning or controlled training areas will be
   immediately reported to the safety officer and/or the controlling agency.

   6.6.2. EMC will not make a judgment on the potential hazard of non-participating aircraft
   detected within areas. All detected non-participating aircraft will be reported to the
   controlling agency for evaluation.
   6.6.3. For hot missions within the warning areas, personnel involved will obtain clearance
   from the appropriate aircraft control authority (generally CCF or military radar unit (MRU)
   but may be delegated to the flight lead) prior to expending ordnance, dropping objects,
   conducting laser operations, or reeling out tow targets. Clearance will not indicate the status
   of the water surface and impact area. This status must be verified as cleared by visual
   observation or suitable airborne radar.
   6.6.4. 96 TW Range Safety will notify the US Coast Guard of the requirement for a Notice
   to Mariners (NOTMARs). The US Coast Guard will, in turn, issue the NOTMARs. The
   current requirements for public notification of surface waters that will be closed due to
   mission activity are contained in the NOAA Coastal Pilot.
6.7. Execution Day Airspace/Resource Coordination
   6.7.1. The JTTOCC (RCS and MMS) is the single point of contact for mission management
   and coordination on day of mission execution to include all scheduled mission changes
   (except for “Scammed Airspace” see below). The following procedures apply to requesting,
   coordinating, and approving execution day changes to the 96 TW Daily Operations Order.
   6.7.2. The mission test engineer (TE) or POC will notify the JTTOCC/RCS as soon as
   practical when there is a mission status change to include any anticipated delays in scheduled
   start time. This will allow JTTOCC/RCS personnel to research possible mission extensions
   and release airspace and/or resources that would otherwise go unused due to a mission
   starting late, or after the scheduled mission start time. No airspace and/or resource will be
   released without prior coordination with the mission TE or POC.
   6.7.3. The mission TE or POC will release any airspace and/or resources not required back
   to the JTTOCC prior to mission start time or at the earliest opportunity.
   6.7.4. When requesting mission add-ons, extensions, or requesting additional
   airspace/resources, the mission TE or POC will make every effort to determine the
   availability of airspace/resources prior to contacting the JTTOCC/RCS. This information can
   be obtained in CSE.
   6.7.5. The 96th Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will notify the JTTOCC/RCS if a
   scheduled 96 TW or 53 WG aircraft will not make the scheduled crew ready time. The
   normal crew ready time is 50 minutes prior to the aircraft scheduled takeoff time. The nature
   of the problem and an estimated time in completion (ETIC) should accompany the
   notification. The JTTOCC/RCS will then place the mission on aircraft maintenance alert and
   notify the TE and support agencies of the expected delay. The JTTOCC/RCS, after
   coordinating with the effected TE or POC, will release any airspace or resources that will not
   be utilized to other users upon request.
   6.7.6. Ground test and training mission TEs and/or POCs will notify the JTTOCC/MMS of
   mission start and stop times, or when reaching/vacating the range, whichever is applicable.
   Exception: This does not apply to Major Ground Test facility (GWEF, MCL, or JPRIMES)

   missions, missions conducted on A22 or A24, or task related missions such as munitions
   deliveries, range clean ups, PMF, etc..
6.8. “Scammed” Airspace Procedures
   6.8.1. Scammed airspace is defined as airspace assigned to an airborne mission by EMC and
   will not be scheduled in CSE. Normally, scammed airspace is assigned to missions due to
   other scheduled mission activity not currently using the airspace, or no scheduled activity in
   the assigned airspace. Requests include real-time mission extensions and/or changes in
   assigned airspace. The following procedures and clarifications apply to scammed airspace.
      6.8.1.1. Scammed airspace applies to Warning Area W-151. Scammed airspace in the
      restricted areas are not authorized due to requirement to abide by shared airspace
      agreements and/or agreeing to avoid any active ground mission activity and any request
      from aircrew must be forwarded to JTTOCC/MMS.
      6.8.1.2. Scammed airspace may be requested by mission aircrews, or the controlling
      agency such as an MRU for 33 FW or 325 FW training missions. Requests for real-time
      extensions should be made at least 10 minutes prior to the end of the scheduled range
      time.
      6.8.1.3. Scammed airspace requests will normally not be used for test missions.
      Exception: Test missions utilizing only airspace and communication frequencies as
      scheduled range resources.
      6.8.1.4. Test and/or training mission utilizing other range resources such as CCF, radars,
      telemetry, threats, jamming pods, Combat Training System pods (e.g., P5 pod), etc., must
      contact the JTTOCC/RCS for mission extensions and airspace changes (airspace change
      requests may be relayed to the JTTOCC/MMS from EMC controllers).
      6.8.1.5. Scheduled airspace will have priority over scammed airspace. Mission aircrews
      utilizing scammed airspace will exit the airspace upon the EMC controller request due to
      in-bound scheduled mission activity. Scammed airspace will be assigned at the
      discretion of the EMC controllers based on airspace availability.
6.9. Eglin East/West and North/South Corridor
   6.9.1. Eglin corridor operating procedures are defined in Federal Air Regulation 14 CFR
   Part 93, Special Air Traffic Rules, and letters of agreement with the FAA.
   6.9.2. The North/South corridor airspace is from surface up to but not including FL180,
   bordered on the west by R2915A/B; on the east by R2918, R2914A, and R2919A; on the
   north by the southern-most boundary of V-198 and on the south by latitude 30-25-01N.
   While operating in the north-south corridor, an aircraft must have clearance from ERCF and
   maintain two-way radio communications while within the corridor. This area is designated
   as a part of the Eglin Land Flying Area to facilitate aircraft movement to/from Eglin
   Main/Eglin Auxiliary Field 3 (Duke Field), Destin Airport and the various flying areas
   identified above. This area is also used in conjunction with the range complexes to support
   special mission requirements and can only be closed to other users for short periods of time
   and/or specific altitudes.
   6.9.3. The East/West corridor is the airspace from surface up to but not including 8,500 feet
   under R-2914B and R-2919B; surface up to but not including FL 180 between R-2919B and
 44                                                    EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


   R-2915C; and surface up to but not including 8,500 feet under R-2915C. Unless otherwise
   authorized by ERCF, persons will not operate an aircraft in flight within the east-west
   corridor without establishing two-way radio communications with ERCF receiving an ATC
   advisory concerning activities being conducted therein, and maintaining two-way radio
   communications while within the corridor.
   6.9.4. In addition to these special rules, the following mission scheduling procedures apply:
      6.9.4.1. A maximum of two cardinal altitudes separated by 1,000 feet can be requested,
      except when the north-south corridor is to be closed by NOTAM for testing of long range
      air-delivered weapons and missiles. Requests for additional altitude in Eglin corridors
      will be addressed on an individual basis. Altitude blocks within the North/South Corridor
      below 4,000 feet must be coordinated through the CAMMP to prevent unnecessarily
      restricting Eglin and Duke Field flight operations.
      6.9.4.2. Project officers are required to brief EMC at least 40 minutes prior to mission
      start time for all corridor operations. This allows sufficient time to coordinate corridor
      altitudes with adjacent air traffic facilities.
      6.9.4.3. Corridor operations, which have not been coordinated with EMC, may result in
      mission start time being delayed a minimum of 30 minutes.
6.10. Fixed Wing Air-To-Ground Gunnery Safety Profile Altitudes
   6.10.1. EMC controllers may adjust safety profile altitudes for fixed wing air-to-ground
   gunnery mission aircraft operating at a fixed altitude within a scheduled Safety Profile, that
   are not utilizing the full extend (altitude-wise) of the Safety Profile airspace. EMC controllers
   may allow other aircraft (military or civilian) to traverse through or use the airspace above
   the mission aircraft as long as these aircraft are separated vertically by at least 1,000 feet and
   the operating gunship is at an altitude of 6,000 feet or higher. Both aircraft (mission and
   itinerate) should be aware of each other's altitudes and be directed to remain at their
   respective altitudes when "sharing" the airspace. This only applies to fixed wing (not rotary)
   air-to-ground "gunnery" mission aircraft.
6.11. Marine Radio Procedures
   6.11.1. To ensure maximum safety and to enhance community relations, JTTOCC/MMS will
   broadcast marine advisories to vessels concerning hazardous testing activity conducted over
   the Gulf of Mexico.
6.12. Eglin Water Test Areas (EWTA) Procedures
   6.12.1. The Eglin Water Test Areas (EWTAs), shown in Figure 6.1, are the schedulable
   areas south of W-151, W-155, and W-470. These areas are not Warning Areas and are
   scheduled by NOTAM only. When missile, probe or drone launch hazard areas cannot be
   confined to warning airspace, the EWTAs may be scheduled with the FAA in accordance
   with an existing letter of agreement. 96 OSS/OSO is responsible for review and coordination
   of required NOTAMs.

                                           Chapter 7

                                     MISSION PROFILES

7.1. General
   7.1.1. Mission profiles are used to depict the airspace and/or ground space required for a
   mission conducted within the Eglin reservation in restricted airspace, the Eglin MOAs, the
   warning areas, and associated areas. A profile is just the right amount of airspace volume or
   surface area to meet the requirements of the test or training mission. Profiles are either
   standard or non-standard and may be either Hot or Cold. The nomenclature or identity of a
   profile is “Mission-Area.Alpha identifier with sequence number”, e.g., B75.L02.              The
   Mission Area is usually the center point of a range test or training area or, if a larger area is
   required, the airspace identifier, e.g., R2915A. The Alpha identifier is “L” for an air profile
   over the land; “G” for ground activities; and “S” for safety. Water profiles, “W,” are
   different and will be explained in a later paragraph in this chapter. When approved, profiles
   are stored in the CSE data base and are available to use as a resource during mission
   scheduling.
   7.1.2. Profile altitudes in CSE are Mean Sea Level (MSL). Air traffic controllers will treat
   all altitudes as MSL. Program Managers should ensure minimum and maximum altitudes are
   based on MSL when requesting new CSE profiles.
       7.1.2.1. Ensure the minimum profile altitude is at or above the terrain elevation. Either
       use “surface” or the actual MSL altitude that is above the terrain elevation.
7.2. Profile Descriptions
   7.2.1. Standard Profiles.
       7.2.1.1. Standard profiles have been established by the Airspace Management Office for
       use by any test or training program and are available in the CSE data base. A limited
       number of standard land and ground profiles are available for use over the land range,
       usually around range test areas. Standard water profiles are three-dimensional blocks of
       airspace. Warning areas W-151 and W-470 have been sub-divided to make scheduling
       and use more efficient. Figure 7.1 depicts the divisions of the warning areas. These
       profiles are not aircraft specific so the test engineer/coordinator needs to ensure the
       aircraft can operate within the profile.
   7.2.2. Nonstandard Profiles.
       7.2.2.1. Nonstandard profiles are designed for specific areas, either for ground tracks,
       areas, or three-dimensional blocks of airspace that meet mission requirements. These
       profiles must be approved for an authorized test directive and will only be scheduled for
       that JON. Nonstandard profiles are created by the test engineer/coordinator, entered into
       the CSE, and coordinated with the profile approving offices. The profile creation process
       is discussed in a later paragraph in this chapter.
   7.2.3. Air Profiles Over the Land.
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                             47


     7.2.3.1. These profiles will be identified with an “L” and will use EAFB Form
     111A/B/C, Land Range Profile, to depict the ground track of the aircraft and/or the
     airspace required for the mission. The “L” profiles do not include the actual ground.
  7.2.4. Ground Profiles.
     7.2.4.1. “G” profiles are for scheduled mission activities on the ground within the land
     range and use the EAFB Form 111B, Land Range Profile (West) or EAFB 111C, Land
     Range Profile (East). Ground profiles may include the airspace above for activities such
     as ground explosions, tethered balloons, or for gun fire.
  7.2.5. Safety Profiles.
     7.2.5.1. “S” profiles depict the land area and altitude that will contain the hazardous
     activity. These profiles will generally exceed the boundaries of a specific test area, but
     must be contained within the Eglin land reservation boundaries. Safety profiles will
     identify highways and range roads that must be closed. In addition there may be specific
     requirements for ground spotters and procedures for communications with the appropriate
     control facilities. Safety profiles are initiated by 96 TW/SEU.
  7.2.6. Water Profiles.
     7.2.6.1. “W” profiles are all standard profiles. The nomenclature for a water profile is
     “Warning Area. Warning Sub-area,” e.g., W-151A1. There are three warning areas; W-
     151, W-470 and W-155. The sub-areas are further defined in the Flight Information
     Planning (FLIP) documents or in EAFBI 11-201. Figure 7.1 depicts the divisions of the
     W-151/W-470 warning areas. W-151B1, W-151E, W-151F, W-151S3, W-151S4, W-
     151S5, W-151S6, and W-151S7 must be specifically requested. These areas are not part
     of any schedulable group. Use the EAFB Forms 112A/B/C/D to depict the required
     volume of airspace over the water.
  7.2.7. The shoreline water profiles of W-151 will not normally be scheduled as stand-alone.
  These areas should only be scheduled for a specific reason (e.g., required transition between
  water and land ranges, close proximity to Santa Rosa Island sites). Approval for Shoreline
  stand-alone use/scheduling must be provided by OG/CC, normally at the ATR/SB.

   7.2.8. When land, ground, or water profiles are being used to fire, launch, release ordnance,
   fire a laser or other directed energy, release chaff or flares, or other activity defined as
   hazardous by Range Safety, they must be designated as a HOT profile. All hot profiles must
   be contained within the appropriate test area boundaries (e.g., test area B-75) or have an
   associated safety profile when test area boundaries are exceeded, and include
   minimum/maximum altitudes.
   7.2.9. Land, ground, and water profiles that are not hazardous as described in the previous
   paragraph are designated COLD profiles. They may encompass any land area, test areas
   and/or portions of the Eglin reservation.
7.3. Mission Profile Development
   7.3.1. Profile Transfer.
                  7.3.1.1. If an existing profile satisfies the mission requirements, note the JON and profile
                  number. Use existing CSE EAFB Form 111 transferring from or complete an electronic
                  EAFB Form 111, with the profile attributes desired but do not put the drawing on the
                  form. Add in red to the top of the form next to the form title, “PROFILE TRANSFER
                  FROM JON: (JON transfer from).” Change attributes such as min/max altitude,
                  HOT/COLD, aircraft, etc. and remarks to meet mission requirements. Submit the form
                  using the Livelink “Enterprise Workspace: 96TW Range Profiles.” Make sure the
                  attributes are selected including the “YES” block for the “Profile Transfer” attribute. In
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                             49


     the comments section list the Range Safety point of contact and any other pertinent
     information the Airspace Management Office needs to know.
  7.3.2. Do not transfer a profile that is not the “right size” for your mission requirements.
  Instead, start a new profile, as discussed in the paragraph below.
  7.3.3. New Profiles.
     7.3.3.1. If existing profiles will not meet the mission requirements, then a new profile
     must be developed which will include a new drawing. The test engineer or project officer
     is encouraged to contact the Airspace Management Office for assistance prior to initiating
     the process for developing a new profile. The profile development process requires both
     input into CSE so that it can be scheduled, and an electronic copy of the EAFB Form
     111A/B/C, Land Range Profile, and EAFB Forms 112A/B/C/D , Water Range Profile,
     submitted through Livelink for coordination and approval. Organizations not having
     access to Livelink should contact 96 OSS/OSP for assistance.
  7.3.4. EAFB Form 111A depicts the entire land range, EAFB Form 111B depicts the west
  side of the land range, and EAFB Form 111C depicts the east side of the land range. The
  EAFB Form 111A will be used for all flying missions unless EAFB Form 111B or C would
  be more appropriate. EAFB Forms 111B and C are usually used for ground profiles as the
  range road detail is better. The form can be found in the EAFB electronic forms library.
  When the test area or closest test area has been determined to meet the mission requirements,
  draw the profile on the electronic EAFB Form 111A/B/C. Then enter CSE and go to Mission
  Resources/Profiles/Profile Info/Add Profile. As the information is entered, write the same
  information down since it will have to be entered into the electronic EAFB Form 111A/B/C.
  During the CSE profile development process, the computer will generate a profile number for
  the new profile. It may be the last time it is viewed during the profile development process.
  Enter the following information into the profile template. Once finished, select Save, the
  profile will go into Temp (or temporary) status.
     7.3.4.1. Air/Range Area. This is a menu of all the range areas and airspace. Select the
     one that is the mission test area or closest to it. For example B-70 or C-52N or R2915A.
     7.3.4.2. Standard. This is a yes or no menu. All newly designed profiles will be
     nonstandard and have an association with a JON.
     7.3.4.3. JON. Enter the JON for the project or mission.
     7.3.4.4. Type. Enter “G” for ground profile or “L” for air profile over the land. “S” and
     “W” are utilized by the Airspace Management and Range Safety Offices.
     7.3.4.5. Status. “Temp” or temporary status which is the initial status submitted by the
     test engineers/coordinators. “Submit” status is accomplished by the Scheduling Office
     prior to the profile going to the O&M Mission Information System Contractor.
     7.3.4.6. Start/End/Pre/Post Times. Disregard and ensure zeros are entered.
     7.3.4.7. Min/Max Altitude. Enter the profile minimum and maximum altitude.
     Remember altitudes in CSE are MSL so take into account the terrain for low missions.
     7.3.4.8. Hot. Enter yes or no based on the profile descriptions above.

      7.3.4.9. Supersonic. Enter yes or no based on the mission requirements. Review EAFBI
      11-201, Air Operations, for those areas where supersonic flight may occur.
      7.3.4.10. De-conflict Flag. Check the box.
      7.3.4.11. Control. Enter the controlling agency for the mission when using the profile.
      EMC, Central Control Facility (CCF), Joint Test and Training Operations Control Center
      (JTTOCC), or the appropriate manned range control (B-75, C-62, etc.).
      7.3.4.12. Activated Areas. This is a menu driven entry. Enter all the airspace and test
      areas that would be impacted by operations in the profile.
      7.3.4.13. Approved Aircraft. This is a menu driven entry. Enter all the aircraft that will
      fly in the profile. If the aircraft is not listed, contact the CSE Aircraft Resource Manager
      posted on the CSE Home Page and provide the appropriate information. Try to be as
      specific as possible. For unmanned air systems (UAS), try to find the military
      nomenclature and have it entered, e.g., MQ9 Reaper UAV. Use UAV as the aircraft and
      list the types of UAVs in the remarks section.
      7.3.4.14. Approval Area/Date. For later use when profiles are coordinated in CSE.
      7.3.4.15. Standard Remarks. Select all standard remarks that apply to this profile.
      7.3.4.16. Custom Remarks. Enter custom remarks which convey information to
      controlling and other agencies that can be used during the mission. Remarks may refer to
      weather, munitions, safety profiles, etc. Include remarks of the profile description. For
      example a circle description remark would be “A 4 NM radius circle around center point
      N30°22’45”/W086°35’03””. Use latitude, longitude, and landmarks such as roads or
      rivers or airspace/range boundaries. This will assist the 96 TW O&M Contractor/MIS to
      draw the profile in GeoMedia which is the system used by CSE.
7.4. Profile Coordination and Approval
   7.4.1. When the profile has been saved to CSE, the next step is to ensure the drawing on the
   EAFB Form 111A/B/C is correct and the other information is typed into the electronic form.
   Click on the drawing and then use the WORD drawing tools under
   Autoshapes/Lines/Freeform. The initial shape can be edited by right clicking the perimeter
   of the drawing and selecting edit points when the initial drawing is selected. The drawing
   does not have to be perfect, just close if the description in the remarks is accurate. Save the
   form as “PROFILE-JON.” Now the profile is ready for coordination and approval using
   Livelink “Enterprise Workspace: 96TW Range Profiles.” Make sure the attributes are
   selected including the “NO” block for the “Profile Transfer” attribute. In the comments
   section list the Range Safety point of contact and any other pertinent information the
   Airspace Management Office needs to know.
   7.4.2. Profile Approving Offices in Livelink.
      7.4.2.1. Airspace Management Office (96 OSS/OSXA). This office provides policies,
      procedures, and requirements governing local air operations within the Eglin complex,
      and is the office for coordinating on the development of land, ground, and security
      profiles.
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                              51


      7.4.2.2. Airfield Operations Flight (96 OSS/OSA). The Chief, Airspace Management
      and Mission Planning (96 OSS/OSAA) is located in this flight and is the air traffic
      control representative who coordinates mission airspace requirements with the Air Traffic
      Control System.
      7.4.2.3. Range Safety (96 TW/SEU). This office reviews profiles to ensure any
      necessary safety criteria are included, the hot/cold mission criteria are met, and the
      correct controlling agency is included.
      7.4.2.4. Flight Safety (96 TW/SEF). This office reviews profiles for safety of flight
      procedures regarding aircraft operations.
      7.4.2.5. 40 FLTS/DO. This is a rated aircrew member who is current in high
      performance aircraft and will ensure the profile conforms to the operational capability of
      the aircraft.
      7.4.2.6. 96 OSS/OSO. This office provides CSE technical assistance and ensures
      scheduling compatibility.
7.5. Changes to Approved Profiles.
   7.5.1. Any changes to approved profiles (e.g., add aircraft) must be coordinated through the
   Airspace Management Office for all but safety profiles which will be the 96 TW Range
   Safety (96 TW/SEU). If the change involves the profile drawing, this constitutes a new
   profile and the process described above applies.

                                          Chapter 8

                          CSE POST MISSION REPORT (PMR)

8.1. Purpose
   8.1.1. The CSE PMR provides 96 TW with mission results and is one of the source
   documents for the computerized historical file. Any organization using 96 TW schedulable
   range resources through CSE may submit a PMR. Training missions are not required to
   submit a CSE PMR. The following mission types are required to submit a PMR: 96 TW test
   missions (not including the major ground test facilities); 96 TW task or test task missions
   using 96 TW/53 WG aircraft.
8.2. Submitting a PMR
   8.2.1. The test engineer/project officer will submit an automated CSE PMR upon completion
   of each mission. Classified information will not be included on the form. All CSE PMRs are
   due COB of following duty day of mission completion. For missions off base, test engineers
   should call/e-mail in the results to their organizations for submittal into CSE.
   8.2.2. Revised reports will be submitted when previously submitted reports are found to be
   in error or incomplete. For example, a mission reported as productive is later determined to
   be nonproductive, or a mission reported as a 1.0 data mission, is later determined to be a 0.5
   data mission. Revised reports should contain sufficient information to completely replace the
   original report.
8.3. Explanation of Terms in Post Mission Reports
   8.3.1. Number of Data Work Packages (DWPs)—No longer required.
   8.3.2. Remaining DWP—No longer required.
   8.3.3. Reduce DWPs—No longer required.
   8.3.4. Completion Status. Self-explanatory.
   8.3.5. MOT mission. Were you utilizing your method of test?
   8.3.6. Wing PROD. Wing productivity in generating aircraft for airborne missions and 96
   TW controlled assets for ground missions.
   8.3.7. Data Productivity.
      8.3.7.1. This is a percentage of data collected versus what was planned to be collected on
      a mission. For example, a test engineer had planned on completing ten passes on the
      mission but only five were accomplished. A data productivity of 50% might be assigned.
      Also, if ten passes were planned and fifteen were accomplished, a data productivity of
      150% might be assigned. Data productivity may be reported up to 999%.
   8.3.8. Cancellation/Data Productivity Loss Codes.
      8.3.8.1. Up to three different cancellation codes may be used to explain why the mission
      was canceled. Each code is assigned a percentage. The total percentage must add up to
      100%. (See Attachment 2 for a list of approved cancellation codes.) If the mission is
      conducted, but is less than 100% productive versus what was planned, the same codes are
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                                53


      used to explain the data productivity loss. For example, ten passes were planned but only
      seven accomplished due to radar failure. The code for data productivity loss would be
      UD with 100% of the loss attributed to this reason. Another example, the aircraft was
      late in taking off because of a fuel system malfunction, resulting in a loss of mission time
      and ultimately in data productivity loss. In addition to this problem, one of the
      cinetheodolites failed midway through the mission. The two codes for productivity loss
      would be EB for fuel system malfunction and UF for cinetheodolites failure. A
      percentage of the loss will be assigned to each code. There could possibly be a third
      code. The test engineer will decide what codes and percentages apply. The individual
      data productivity loss codes percentage must always add up to 100% of data loss.
   8.3.9. O&M Rating.
      8.3.9.1. Test engineers will rate the quality of support the O&M contractor provided on
      the mission. If O&M contractor support was provided for planning or execution of the
      mission, enter “YES”, in the block provided. If O&M contractor support was used (even
      if the mission was scheduled and cancelled), rate the performance in terms of planning
      and preparation for the mission, organization, and execution of the mission, skill of
      personnel, and adequacy of facility and equipment operations. Any score below “80”
      requires explanatory remarks. Remarks are always encouraged to highlight exceptional
      performance or problem areas. The scoring evaluation ratings, criteria, and scores are
      contained in the Range O&M Award Fee Plan.
   8.3.10. Remarks: Ground mount missions using 96 TW/53 WG aircraft must include the
   actual time used for the aircraft.
8.4. PMR Reporting Program
   8.4.1. 96 TW/XP is the overall manager of the mission results reporting program. 96
   TW/XP will ensure that data collected by the PMR are appropriate and consistent with the
   needs of 96 TW; compile the data necessary to keep the 96 TW/CC informed of the impact
   on 96 TW operations and 96 TW facilities; monitor and control the submission of CSE PMR;
   update the Historical File Maintenance and Reports Systems, as appropriate; and retain the
   reports for 3 years or until action is completed.

                     EGLIN LAND RANGE ACCESS PROCEDURES

9.1. Access to Open Areas of the Land Range
   9.1.1. Open Areas are the areas identified as non-closed areas depicted in EAFBI 13-212 and
   the TW Range Operations Map (contact 96 TW/XPE to obtain hard copies). Personnel are
   allowed to enter these areas without prior approval if they are on official business and the
   area is not scheduled for mission use. You should contact the JTTOCC for daily mission
   schedules.
   9.1.2. All personnel must have a range familiarization hazards briefing to include UXO
   hazards.
   9.1.3. Individuals accessing the reservation for recreation purposes must have in their
   possession a recreation permit issued by Environmental Directorate Natural Resources
   Section (Jackson Guard Station). They must also comply with all rules provided in the Eglin
   AFB outdoor activities map. The public safety range hazards orientation briefing is included
   when getting this permit.
   9.1.4. Jackson Guard will provide a copy of Eglin's Outdoor Recreation Map and any
   publications showing both closed and open areas to each person receiving an Eglin recreation
   permit, and organizational dispatch and control centers as requested.
   9.1.5. Even open areas of the land range are subject to closure in order to enforce a safety
   profile and/or schedule military ground training missions that may present a hazard to non-
   participating personnel.
   9.1.6. During short term or daily closures of open areas, the 96 RANSS O&M contractor is
   responsible for controlling access and clearing untracked users to support military operations.
9.2. Access to Closed Areas of the Land Range
   9.2.1. Closed Areas are the areas depicted in EAFBI 13-212 and the TW Range Operations
   Map (contact 96 TW/XPE to obtain hard copies) and are closed to all unauthorized activities.
   9.2.2. All personnel entering a closed area of the range must either routinely work in that
   area, be assigned to support a scheduled mission, or have a “Z” clearance. For unmanned
   Test Areas A-77, A-78, and B-7, all personnel are required to obtain a “Z” clearance for
   access to include direct support of a scheduled mission.
   9.2.3. A “Z" Clearance is verbal approval by the JTTOCC/MMS to allow a one-time entry
   into a closed area for a specific time, not to be given more than one hour prior to start time.
   This is for people on official business but not assigned to a scheduled mission (see exception
   listed in paragraph 9.2.2.). The JTTOCC/MMS can be contacted at (850)882-5800.
   9.2.4. Personnel requesting a "Z" clearance must provide the following information to the
   JTTOCC before entering the closed area:
      9.2.4.1. Exact clearance location.
      9.2.4.2. Reason clearance is needed.
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                                55


      9.2.4.3. Proposed routes to access the location.
      9.2.4.4. Time on location.
      9.2.4.5. Number and type of personnel (government, contractor, etc.).
      9.2.4.6. Number of vehicles.
   9.2.5. When leaving the closed area, personnel must contact the JTTOCC/MMS to terminate
   their “Z” clearance.
   9.2.6. For unmanned Test Areas A-77, A-78, and B-7, individuals must maintain two-way
   mobile communications with the JTTOCC/MMS in addition to obtaining a “Z” clearance.
   Cellular telephones are not acceptable as the primary means of communication.
   9.2.7. EOD escorts are required for "Z" clearances onto the Dedicated Impact Areas of Test
   Areas A-77, A-78, B-82 (fenced area), B-7, C-52N, C-52E, and portions of C-52C. The
   JTTOCC/MMS will verify that EOD escorts are accompanying the requesting personnel. In
   some cases EOD may determine that escorts are not required. Only EOD personnel may
   make this determination and must notify the JTTOCC/MMS when escorts are not required.
   For C-52C and C-52N, the JTTOCC/MMS will notify the Range Supervisor that EOD escort
   is not required.
   9.2.8. After issuance of "Z" clearances and during normal duty working hours, personnel
   must check-in with the test area supervisor before entering any manned test area. If the test
   area supervisor cannot be reached (e.g., after duty hours), contact the JTTOCC/MMS. On all
   unmanned ranges, call the JTTOCC before entering the test area. Personnel with a "Z"
   clearance will notify JTTOCC immediately after clearing the specified area.
   9.2.9. All personnel must have a range hazards orientation briefing to include UXO hazards.
9.3. Exceptions to "Z" Clearance Requirements
   9.3.1. The following do not require a “Z” Clearance:
      9.3.1.1. Eglin (Main) Base, Auxiliary Field 3 (Duke Field), Auxiliary Field 6 cantonment
      area (Biancur Field), Site C-3 (BISS site), Site C-6, or on Okaloosa Island. For access to
      these areas requester shall contact the test area/facility manager. A “Z” clearance is still
      required for access to the Auxiliary Field 6 runway, taxiway and DZs.

Terms
96 TW Daily Operations Order— The published mission schedule serves as the official 96 TW
tasking for range support agencies. The schedule is produced 3 duty days prior to mission
execution.
Active Test Area— The designated surface area and associated airspace where a specific
mission or test is being conducted. The test area will be declared ACTIVE (HOT) or ACTIVE
(COLD) whichever is appropriate.
Air Mission— An airborne activity including rocket launches, balloon flights, remote pilot
vehicle (RPV) flights, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and missions for which any aircraft
flies.
Aircraft Operational/Mission/Ground Support Requirements Report— The printed
maintenance schedule that outlines specific operational requirements, mission tasking, and
ground support requirements involving maintenance and the use of aircraft.
Alternate Mission— A mission submitted on the same day as the primary mission requesting
nearly the same or similar resources. For example, you may submit a HOT primary mission with
a COLD mission as an alternate, but, you cannot submit a cold primary and a hot alternate, since
more resources are normally needed to support a HOT mission (e.g., safety profile, different
freq/TM, different range support, etc.). If a water profile is submitted with a HOT mission and
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                                 57


an alternate with a land profile it is not likely that the land mission would be able to be plugged
in, if the primary is nonscheduled/cancelled.
Backup Mission— An identical mission submitted to ensure that if a primary mission cancels, a
mission is already in the scheduling cycle to replace it. Consecutive day backup missions may
need approval by 96 OSS/CC for 96 TW missions. Normally, a backup mission is not requested
for the day following the primary mission.
Blackboard Missions— Any CSE Mission Request that did not make the final submittal /cut-off
time for the two week scheduling cycle (two weeks prior). These missions may need special
approval and are scheduled if the resources are available. The requestor must include the
specific reason code identifying why the blackboard mission is required.
Business Effort (BE) Tanker— An AMC refueling tanker assigned to Eglin on a TDY rotating
basis. POC is 96 OSS/OSO tanker scheduler. Normally two BE tankers support Eglin each
week from various tanker units around the country.
Cancelled Mission—A scheduled mission no longer needed and pulled from the schedule after
the Operation Order is printed. Only those persons listed on the mission request, a representative
of the mission requesters scheduling unit/liaison or 96 OSS/OSO may cancel a mission.
Central Control Facility (CCF)—The facility where control of mission activities is conducted
by the TE, Safety, aircraft control and other members of the execution team.
Chief Airspace Management and Mission Planning (CAMMP)—The ATC office responsible
for coordinating airspace requirements listed on mission request and EMC.
Cold Mission—A scheduled mission activity determined to be non-hazardous to the extent that
work party activities or other simultaneous and joint operations can be safely conducted within
the same test area or airspace.
Completed Mission/Sortie—Once a mission or sortie is begun, it will be considered complete at
the end of the scheduled range period unless appropriate authority advises JTTOCC that the
mission/sortie (ground to air) has been aborted or canceled. Reference to mission or sortie
completion is not related to the success or productivity of the mission/sortie.
Configuration—The various ways a resource can be configured for scheduling. Normally once
a resource is scheduled with any type of configuration, it is unavailable during the same time slot
to be scheduled by other missions, unless simultaneous operations are approved.
Consecutive Day—Test missions approved by 96 OSS/CC for back-to-back daily scheduling,
where the previous day's mission should not affect the next day's missions. 96 TW Form 773 is
required when requesting consecutive day. Any 96 TW test programs requiring three or more
consecutive days must request approval.
Crew Ready—Aircraft must be properly configured and ready for flight with the exceptional
release signed off no later than 50 minutes prior to scheduled take-off.
Dependent Missions—Missions that are dependent on each other to accomplish a particular
objective. They may be scheduled on the same day or the next.
Drop Dead Time—At 1200L day prior to mission execution, when the decision must be made to
either schedule or non-schedule a mission that had been on scheduled hold. If an extension is
needed, 96 OSS/OSO must approve.
 58                                                    EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


Early Turn-on—The process that allows the scheduling of test task/task ground mission without
a signed test directive. The Program Engineer (PE) for the project initiates the early turn-on
process. There is no early turn-on provision for test missions; a signed TD must be in place prior
to execution of any test mission.
Eglin East-West Corridor—Airspace from surface up to but not including 8,500 feet under R-
2914B and R-2919B; surface up to but not including FL 180 between R-2919B and R-2915C;
and surface up to but not including 8,500 feet under R-2915C. Unless otherwise authorized by
ERCF, persons will not operate an aircraft in flight within the east-west corridor without
establishing two-way radio communications with ERCF receiving an ATC advisory concerning
activities being conducted therein, and maintaining two-way radio communications while within
the corridor.
Eglin North-South Corridor—Airspace from surface up to but not including FL180, bordered
on the west by R2915A/B; on the east by R2918, R2914A, and R2919A; on the north by the
southern-most boundary of V-198 and on the south by latitude 30-25-01N. While operating in
the north-south corridor, an aircraft must have clearance from ERCF and maintain two-way radio
communications while within the corridor. This area is designated as a part of the Eglin Land
Flying Area to facilitate aircraft movement to/from Eglin Main/Eglin Auxiliary Field 3 (Duke
Field), and the various flying areas identified above. This area is also used in conjunction with
the range complexes to support special mission requirements and can only be closed to other
users for short periods of time and/or specific altitudes.
Eglin "E" MOA/Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA)—Use of the Eglin "E"
MOA/ATCAA is applicable only to missions under control of ERCF that under present
procedures are not classified as hazardous, but because of airspeed and altitude, must be
accommodated in the MOA/ATCAA. Available altitudes are from surface to FL230. The Eglin
"E" includes the airspace encompassed by R2914A/B, R2915A/B/C, R2918, R2919A/B, (does
not include R2917) from surface to FL 180. The Eglin E ATCCA overlies the north-south
corridor from FL 180 to FL 600.
Eglin Mission Control (EMC)— Provides monitoring services along with controlling mission
activity over the test and training range complex. Provides limited terminal services.
Eglin Radar Control Facility (ERCF)—- The ERCF is divided into two collocated functions:
Eglin Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) which is responsible for providing terminal ATC
services and EMC which is responsible for providing ATC services and monitoring aircraft
operating in Eglin’s special use airspace (SUA).
Eglin Water Test Areas—Airspace (outside controlled, restricted, or warning airspace) in the
Gulf of Mexico which has been given geographical dimensions and designed as Eglin Water Test
Area (EWTA 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) for purpose of hazardous activity. FAA vice 96 TW controls
these areas.
Estimated Time In Commission (ETIC)—The time when an aircraft or other equipment is
estimated to be operationally ready. ETIC does not include preflight, prestart, basic postflight, or
load time requirements as applicable for any specific mission.
Flight Profile—A three dimensional description of aircraft movement.            The flight profile
includes ground track, altitude, airspeed limits, etc.
EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014                                                                  59


Ground Mission—An event conducted entirely on the ground. Examples of ground missions
are munitions detonations, range cleanup, aircraft ground tests, and missions on water surfaces.
Gulf Area Frequency Coordinator—The Department of Defense, in accordance with the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, the MCEB, and the military departments, established the DOD Area Frequency
Coordinator (AFC) system to ensure successful operation of the extensive communication-
electronics equipment on the national and service test and training ranges.
Higher Priority Mission (HPM)—This term is used to indicate that resources requested for a
specific mission are assigned to another mission with a higher priority.
High Value Event—An event that may occur during the overflight of an Open Skies treaty
aircraft. The definition of a high value event is; any activity that will incur substantial monetary
cost if postponed or canceled; cannot be canceled and reveals national security information, if
observed; takes advantage of a unique set of chronological or meteorological circumstances,
which cannot be duplicated; the installation believes special circumstances apply.
Hold Time—A delay in mission progress due to mission conflict for maintenance or weather
delays. Based on missions existing at the time, a hold time may extend as long as required
mission support resources can be retained.
Hot Mission—Any ground or air mission during which a weapon is fired or released which can
cause injury or damage to include laser operations and supersonic flight. For airborne missions,
this includes drop of any object from an aircraft. All missions releasing flares are hot; however,
depending on the type, certain restrictions may be lifted (see EAFBI 11-201).
Inactive Test Area—A test area not being used for a scheduled test, training mission, or other
authorized activity.
Independent Missions—A mission that does not depend upon the scheduling of another mission
and is not a substitute/backup for another mission.
Instrumentation Checkout—tasks conducted to checkout or calibrate data collecting test
support instrumentation that is not normally a part of the test item or system.
Job Order Number (JON)—An eight-digit alphanumeric code that identifies a specific
workload effort (e.g., test or training). It is composed of a four-digit system/project number, a
one-digit financial manager code, a one-digit customer code, and a two-digit serial number, per
paragraph 3.3, 96 TWI 65-601, Job Order Cost Accounting Operations.
JON Date—The date on which a JON is assigned to a specific workload.
JON Phase—A term used to designate the status (phase) of a JON, e.g., Planning, Active,
closeout, or suspended.
JON Start Date—The date the Initial Contract (IC) is signed. The JON is entered into the
computerized database and the planning phase begins.
JON Title—The title assigned to the workload effort, e.g., AMRAAM, Hellfire.
Live Mission—Any mission involving the carriage, drop, release, launch, or ground detonation
of a weapon/projectile/warhead with primary explosive fills. These mission conditions are set by
the test or training requester and automatically included on the 96 TW Daily Operations Order
 60                                                    EGLINAFBI13-204 14 JANUARY 2014


and the daily Aircraft Operational/Mission/Ground Support Requirements report (maintenance
schedule).
Management Emphasis (ME)—Missions approved by 96 OSS/CC that will be scheduled over
other higher priority missions because of a more efficient use of Eglin resources, higher
headquarter request, meeting a short suspense milestone, or other reasons deemed sufficient to
warrant an increased emphasis. ME requests must be sent to 96 OSS/OSO prior to the normal
on-time mission submittal deadline using the Special Scheduling Consideration Request 96 TW
Form 773. The ME request must be endorsed by the requester’s squadron CC/CV/DO. 96
OSS/OSO will review the request for impacts to other Eglin programs and forward to 96
OSS/CC.
Mission—Any test, task, test task, exercise, or training activity (air or ground) submitted through
CSE to accomplish a specific objective.
Mission Aborted—A mission that utilizes part of its scheduled range time or support but
terminates before its objective is accomplished.
