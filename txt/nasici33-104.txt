1. GENERAL. The Director, Communications and Information, designates the NASIC
Knowledge Operations Manager Functional Manager. The NASIC 3D0X1 Functional Manager
is a full-time position requiring the integral support of each commander, director, division chief,
branch chief, supervisor, and trainer to ensure effectiveness. Each group and directorate plays an
important role in the 3D0X1 utilization and training process. Each group and directorate must be
involved in the effective use of their 3D0X1 assets, both in accomplishing the mission as well as
the proper use and career development of each Knowledge Operations Manager. Knowledge
Operations Managers are in multiple and varied organizations across the Air Force. The NASIC
3D0X1 Functional Manager is the central facilitation point to assist with assignment allocation,
training and training oversight, utilization, readiness, deployments and career guidance for all
Knowledge Operations Managers assigned to NASIC. Each group, squadron, and directorate
will consult with the functional manager before implementing any enlisted 3D0X1 personnel
moves between groups and directorates. Furthermore, the 3D0X1 Functional Manager will be
contacted to coordinate on all Manpower Change Requests (MCRs) that result in a change to
AFSC, skill level, or grade for any 3D0X1 enlisted manpower position.
2. REQUIREMENTS:
     2.1. Air Force policy is to distribute personnel proportionally based on total career field
     strength. HQ AFISRA staffs NASIC with 3D0X1 personnel based on this strength. In
     accordance with this policy, NASIC will staff authorized 3D0X1 positions throughout
     NASIC based on equitable proportions.
     2.2. HQ AFISRA encourages the rotation of 3D0X1s after performing a specific job for 18-
     24 months. Rotation ensures broad-based training with one primary benefit: broad-based
     and greater depth of experience will allow staffing losses to be covered quickly with a
     minimum loss of support.
     2.3. Constraints and Variables:
        2.3.1. Inbound 3D0X1 personnel may not have the appropriate security clearances to be
        SCI- indoctrinated upon arrival.
        2.3.2. Inbound 3D0X1 personnel new to the career field may not have sufficient training
        in the field to be productive in certain positions.
3. DECISION CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES:
     3.1. Each group and directorate will be manned in proportion with overall 3D0X1 manning
     available. For example, if NASIC is 85% manned, each group and directorate will be
     manned as close to 85% as possible.
     3.2. The 3D0X1 Functional Manager will coordinate and maintain a draft “job description”
     of each authorized 3D0X1 position within NASIC. These documents will serve as guides for
     the 3D0X1 Functional Manager to allocate inbound personnel and determine the best
     possible rotations. These documents will also assist supervisors in defining job requirements,
     evaluating performance, and managing the training of their 3D0X1 personnel.
     3.3. Allocation of inbound 3D0X1 personnel:
        3.3.1. All 3D0X1 inbounds will be allocated by the 3D0X1 Functional Manager based
        on the manning levels of each group/directorate and the rank and experience level of each
        inbound.
NASICI 33-104 31 AUGUST 2010                                                                 3


  3.4. Sponsorship of inbound 3D0X1 personnel requiring 5-level upgrade training:
     3.4.1. Inbound 3D031 personnel arriving from Keesler AFB technical training will
     usually not arrive with a Top Secret (TS) security clearance, so they will initially be
     assigned to work in the NASIC Mail Center (SCOK Branch). In these instances, SCOK
     will assign a sponsor to the inbound 3D031 member. Upon arrival, the 3D031 will begin
     5-level upgrade training as well as other 3D0X1 on-the-job (OJT) duties as required.
     Upon receipt of TS security clearance and successful completion of 5-level upgrade
     training, 3D0X1 personnel will be released to their appropriate duty section. If 5-level
     upgrade training has been accomplished, but the member is awaiting their security
     clearance, the member may be utilized in a duty section not requiring a TS security
     clearance.
  3.5. Sponsorship of inbound 3D0X1 personnel not in upgrade training:
     3.5.1. Sponsorship responsibilities for inbound 3D0X1 personnel not requiring 5-level
     upgrade training will fall to the member’s gaining unit.
  3.6. Rotation of 3D0X1 personnel:
     3.6.1. Rotation of 3D0X1 personnel can be initiated for two primary reasons:
         3.6.1.1. A 3D0X1 has more than 18-24 months of experience in a certain position
         (minimum time recommended by AF ISR Agency).
         3.6.1.2. Rotation of personnel to fill vacated position in group or directorate until
         replacement inbound arrives. The group or directorate shall notify the 3D0X1
         Functional Manager, in writing/e-mail or via telephone, upon notification that his/her
         3D0X1 personnel will be vacating the position due to separation, retirement, PCA, or
         PCS.
         3.6.1.3. All 3D0X1 moves will be coordinated in writing/e-mails with the affected
         offices and the 3D0X1 Functional Manager.
  3.7. Reasons why a 3D0X1 might not be rotated:
     3.7.1. Length of time in specific job is less than 18 months.
     3.7.2. Member is separating, retiring, or PCS’ing in less than one year.
     3.7.3. Qualifications and security clearance.
     3.7.4. Skill deficiencies that may require movement to a new position or deny movement
     to a new position.
     3.7.5. 3D0X1 move/rotation disputes will be resolved by NASIC/CC or CV, facilitated
     by the 3D0X1 Functional Manager . The 3D0X1 Functional Manager will maintain a
     hard copy of the written coordination.
4. TRAINING:
  4.1. The 3D0X1 Functional Manager will provide a 3D0X1 introduction/orientation briefing
  for each inbound 3D0X1 to NASIC.

       4.1.1. Personnel newly assigned to the career field and those with limited experience will
       require more in-depth exposure to Knowledge Operations Management programs than
       individuals with previous/extensive Knowledge Operations Manager background.
       4.1.2. Supervisors who are 3D0X1 personnel will adhere to training responsibilities in
       accordance with AFI 36-2201, Vols. 1, 2, and 3. Supervisors who are not 3D0X1
       personnel should confer with the senior 3D0X1 member on their group/directorate staff
       to assist with 3D0X1 training responsibilities for their 3D0X1 member. Assigned 3D0X1
       trainers are responsible for complying with mandatory training listed in AFI 36-2201,
       Vol. 3, Chap. 6.
       4.1.3. Work centers will provide the 3D0X1 Functional Manager a list of all assigned
       trainers.
    4.2. The 3D0X1 Functional Manager will review the OJT records on all 3D0X1 personnel in
    upgrade training (5- and 7-skill level) on a quarterly basis. Results of this review will be
    forwarded to each individual’s commander/director for their review, actions, and/or
    comments.
    4.3. The 3D0X1 Functional Manager will review the OJT records of all E-6 and below
    personnel on a semi-annual basis. Results of this review will be forwarded to each
    individual’s commander/director for their review, actions, and/or comments. All Knowledge
    Operations Managers will be evaluated annually.
    4.4. The 3D0X1 Functional Manager will provide advice and assistance on training issues as
    requested.
    4.5. Serious deficiencies in OJT training or an assigned 3D0X1’s performance will be
    evaluated by the 3D0X1 Functional Manager and brought to the attention of the
    commander/director immediately for resolution.
