transform to an enterprise-wide, net-centric, knowledge-based operational environment outlined
in AFPD 33-1, Cyberspace Support. It further defines 38 CEIG support activities documented in
AFI 33-150. This supplement does not apply to the Air National Guard (ANG) and the Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) and their units. Use this supplement in conjunction with Methods
and Procedures Technical Order (TO) 33D-2002, Engineering Installation and Cyberspace
Readiness Activities Management and TO 33D-3003, Managing the Cyberspace Infrastructure
with the Cyberspace Infrastructure Planning System (CIPS). Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air
Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS). Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional chain of

Control) at 38ES.EWOC@tinker.af.mil or via SIPRNet at 38ceg.EWOC@afmc.af.smil.mil.
Requests can also be made through the organizational CSI or utilizing the Work Order
Management System (WOMS) in CIPS (reference TO 00-33D-3003).
1.1.2.2. Initial Analysis. 38 ES will conduct an initial analysis of the request to determine
scope/feasibility of project, and provide an acceptance/non-acceptance recommendation.
1.1.2.3. Resource Determination and Project Planning/Execution Phase. Upon project
acceptance, 38 ES will begin project staffing/planning, technical solution development and
implementation as appropriate. Additionally, 38 ES will notify the 624th Operations Center
(624 OC) and the 688th Information Operations Wing (688 IOW) of the project acceptance. All
cyberspace infrastructure unclassified project information will be documented in CIPS per TO
00-33D-3003.
1.1.2.4. Finalized Documentation. Upon completion of the special project, 38 ES will provide
final documentation to the customer and make inputs to the Knowledge Base Repository once
developed by 690th Network Support Group (690 NSG) (see paragraph 1.2.4).
1.1.3. Evaluation of AFNet Technical Network Data. The 38 CEIG shall conduct technical
analysis of Cyber Vulnerability Assessments, Network Health Assessments, Air Force
Infrastructure Assessments (AFIA), and other engineering data supplied by AFNet operators and
personnel in order to identify recurring or systemic issues for engineering/technical correction or
remediation (see Figure 2). In addition, 38 CEIG will:
1.1.3.1. Conduct analysis of technical data, focusing on systemic issues affecting the defensive
posture of the AFNet. Use the results of the analysis to develop and deliver standard technical
solutions, costing estimates, recommended prioritization, and/or remediation strategies/course of
actions for hardening the AFNet (see Figure 2).
1.1.3.2. Participate on the 67 NWW review board to discuss execution of network assessment
analyses and recommendations as shown in Figure 2. At a minimum, participants should include
24 AF, 688 IOW, and 67 NWW.
1.1.3.3. Use existing 38 CEIG processes to execute remediation and optimization plans
approved by the board that require 38 CEIG resources (see Figure 2).
1.1.3.4. Develop and deliver Project Completion Reports and provide lessons learned for
