SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Due to the
implementation of the 5-Center construct, it encompasses three of the previous twelve AFMC
Centers: OC-ALC (AFMCMD 406), OO-ALC (AFMCMD 407 - rescinded), and WR-ALC
(AFMCMD 410 - rescinded).
1. Mission. Deliver combat capability through around-the-clock, worldwide sustainment
support for Air Force weapon systems. Manage the operational planning and execution of the
Air Force supply chain management and depot maintenance missions for the Command. Provide
sustainment support through legacy weapon system commodity management, supply chain

management, depot maintenance and installation support. Perform an integration role and
partner with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) in weapon system
product support planning to bring greater synergy of supply and depot maintenance activities and
facilitate the implementation of standard business processes across the enterprise. Apply
advanced technology, engineering and budgeting efficiencies across the entire product life cycle
to provide superior combat capability working with AFLCMC and AFSC. With supply chain
management and depot maintenance functions in one organization, analyze and develop
sustainment-wide procedures, processes and metrics with the ultimate goal of increasing
availability, capability and affordability, providing greater ability to posture for additional
workload and preserving the viability of depot maintenance and supply chain as a core capability
of the Air Force. Accomplish the Center mission via six geographical locations (Hill AFB,
Warner Robins AFB, Tinker AFB, Wright-Patterson AFB, Langley AFB and Scott AFB)
through three Air Logistics Complexes (ALC) (OO-ALC UT; WR-ALC GA; and OC-ALC OK),
three Air Base Wings (ABW) (72 ABW, Tinker AFB OK; 75 ABW, Hill AFB UT; and 78
ABW, Warner Robins AFB GA), and two Supply Chain Management organizations (448th
Supply Chain Management Wing at Tinker AFB OK and 635th Supply Chain Operations Wing
at Scott AFB IL).
2. Command. AFSC, headquartered at Tinker AFB OK, is a primary subordinate unit of Air
Force Materiel Command (AFMC). The 72 ABW Commander is the Installation Commander.
3. Organization Structure. The organization structures of AFSC and its subordinate units are
in accordance with the Air Force Blueprint, AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization, and HQ
USAF/HQ AFMC-approved variances to the structures. The approved Blueprint organization
structure                  for                AFSC                   is                   at:
https://org.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/hqafmca1/A1M/Organization/AFMC%20Organization%20
Blueprint%20Charts/Forms/AllItems.aspx.
     3.1. Organization Changes. Requests to change the organization structures of AFSC and
     its subordinate organizations and units must be made in accordance with AFI 38-101 and HQ
     AFMC/A1 policy guidance. Requests that require HQ AFMC/A1 approval must be
     submitted through AFSC/DP and approved by AFSC/CC.
