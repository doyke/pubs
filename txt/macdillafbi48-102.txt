1. Terms Explained.
     1.1. Acclimatization. Acclimatization is a series of physiological adjustments that occur
     when an individual is exposed to a hot climate. A period of approximately 2 weeks with
     progressive degrees of heat exposure and physical exertion should be allowed for substantial
     acclimatization (about 78 percent). Acclimatization to heat begins with the first exposure
     and is usually developed to about 45-52 percent by the end of the first week. Full
     acclimatization is attained most quickly by gradually increasing work in the heat. Full heat
     acclimatization can be achieved by as little as two 50-minute periods of work in the heat each
     day. Once acclimatized, personnel will retain most of the adaptation for about one week
     after leaving a hot climate.
     1.2. Heat Disorders. Heat disorder is a general term used to indicate any type of adverse
     heat-related health problems. Heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke are all forms of
     heat disorder. Heat disorders may be recognized by one or more of the following symptoms:
     nausea, vomiting, fever, dizziness, headache, faintness, abnormal sweating, convulsions, lack
     of coordination, mental confusion, unconsciousness, and abdominal or leg cramps.
     Personnel most likely to be affected by the heat are those individuals who have just arrived
     from cooler regions of the country, are obese, or are in poor condition. Heat disorders are as
     follows:
        1.2.1. Heat Cramps. Heat cramps are painful intermittent spasms of the voluntary
        muscles. Cramps may result from exposure to high temperature for a relatively long
        time, particularly if accompanied by hard physical work. Cramps usually occur after
        heavy sweating and are the result of excessive loss of salt from the body. Even if the
        moisture is replaced by drinking plenty of water, the loss of salt by sweating may cause
        heat cramps.
        1.2.2. Heat Exhaustion. The signs of heat exhaustion are profuse sweating, weakness,
        rapid pulse, dizziness, nausea, and headache. With heat exhaustion, the skin is cold and
        sometimes pale and clammy with sweat, and body temperature is normal or below
        normal. Nausea, vomiting, and unconsciousness may also occur.
        1.2.3. Exertional Heat Injury (EHI) and Exertional Rhabdomyolysis. Exertional heat
        injury represents a continuum in severity between heat exhaustion and heat stroke. EHI
        patients show evidence of organ or tissue injury or dysfunction, but do not display
        sufficient neurological abnormalities to meet the usual criteria of heat stroke. EHI
        victims usually sweat profusely and will cool spontaneously after removal from the heat
        stress, however, in some, their core temperatures may continue to rise.
        1.2.4. Heat Stroke. Heat stroke is caused by exposure to a hot environment in which the
        body is unable to cool itself sufficiently. This results in the body temperature rising
MACDILLAFBI48-102 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                            3


     rapidly. Heat stroke is a much more serious condition than heat cramps or heat
     exhaustion. The skin is usually hot, dry, and flushed. Patients may exhibit neurological
     symptoms such as combativeness. Increased body temperature, if uncontrolled, may lead
     to delirium, convulsions, coma, and even death. Heat stroke is a medical emergency.
  1.3. Heat Stress. Heat stress is the combination of environmental and physical work factors
  that constitute the total heat load imposed on the body. The environmental factors of heat
  stress are the air temperature, radiant heat exchange, air movement, and water vapor
  pressure. Physical work contributes to the total heat stress of the job by producing metabolic
  heat in the body in proportion to the intensity of the work.
  1.4. Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) Index. The WBGT index is the most practical
  heat stress index for characterizing the effect of a heat stress environment on an individual
  because it takes into account humidity, wind speed, and radiant load. WBGT values are
  calculated by the following equations. All readings are given in degrees Fahrenheit. Note:
  The wet bulb temperature is always below the dry bulb temperature except when the relative
  humidity is 100 percent. At this point, both temperatures are equal.
     1.4.1. Outdoors with solar load: WBGT = 0.7 WB + 0.2 BG + 0.1 DB.
     1.4.2. Indoors or outdoors with no solar load: WBGT = 0.7 WB + 0.3 BG.
     1.4.3. Legend: WB = Wet Bulb; BG = Black Globe; and DB = Dry Bulb.
  1.5. Workload. The physical demands of duties being performed. For the purpose of heat
  stress, workload is divided into three categories. Examples of each category are given below:
     1.5.1. Light Work: Drill and ceremony, gate duty.
     1.5.2. Medium Work: Mechanical work performed outdoors, carrying weapon while
     patrolling.
     1.5.3. Heavy Work: Hand digging, assembly/disassembly of satellite communications
     equipment, aircraft washing.
  1.6. WBGT Heat Categories:
     1.6.1. Category 1 (White): WBGT range from 78.0 to 81.9. See Table 1. for work-rest
     cycles and fluid replacement.
     1.6.2. Category 2 (Green): WBGT range from 82.0 to 84.9. See Table 1. for work-rest
     cycles and fluid replacement.
     1.6.3. Category 3 (Yellow): WBGT range from 85.0 to 87.9. See Table 1. for work-rest
     cycles and fluid replacement.
     1.6.4. Category 4 (Red): WBGT range from 88.0 to 89.9. See Table 1. for work-rest
     cycles and fluid replacement.
     1.6.5. Category 5 (Black): WBGT range greater than 89.0. See Table 1. for work-rest
     cycles and fluid replacement.

    1.7. Cold Stress: Cold environments pose a threat to the individual if they exceed the
    capacity of the body’s thermo-regulatory response mechanisms.
       1.7.1. Freezing Cold Injury (FCI) As skin temperature approaches 30 degrees
       Fahrenheit, intense constriction of blood vessels takes place with the potential for
       freezing of tissues and subsequent frostbite (FCI). The following freezing cold injuries
       are described:
          1.7.1.1. Frostnip: When the painful exposed skin blanches and loses sensation but
          remains pliable. This is usually found on facial skin, such as the tips of the nose and
          ears. Move to a warm area and re-warm by placing fingers in the armpit or blowing
          warm air over the frozen surfaces. Do not rub affected area. Recovery is usually
          prompt and medical attention is not necessary.
          1.7.1.2. Frostbite: Causes a loss of feeling and color in the affected areas due to
          freezing temperatures. It most often affects the nose, ears, cheeks, chin, fingers, and
          toes.
          1.7.1.3. Hypothermia: A fall in the body’s core temperature and one who becomes
          incapacitated as the result of a drop in core body temperature.
          1.7.1.4. Chilblains: Caused by the repeated exposure of skin to temperatures just
          above freezing to as high as 60 degrees Fahrenheit. The cold exposure causes
          damage to the capillary beds (groups of small blood vessels) in the skin. This damage
          is permanent and the redness and itching will return with additional exposure. The
          redness and itching typically occur on cheeks, ears, fingers, and toes.
       1.7.2. Non-Freezing Cold Injury (NFCI): Prolonged contact with water or wet clothing
       in the temperature range of 53 degrees Fahrenheit can result in a non-freezing cold injury
       where the peripheral nerves demyelinate with resultant swelling, numbness, and
       blanching followed some time later by intense pain and an increase in blood flow to the
       affected body area.
       1.7.3. Other Effects of Cold. Further to FCI and NFCI, the following may also be seen
       in a cold environment:
          1.7.3.1. Raynaud’s Disease/Syndrome: Cold at a severity that does not affect normal
          people may cause severe arterial vasoconstriction, most commonly affecting the
          fingers, in individuals with Raynaud's Syndrome. In severe cases, this may lead to
          digital ulceration and tissue loss. Protection from the cold by suitable clothing,
          gloves, and shoes is usually sufficient, however, chemical hand warmers may be
          necessary. Individuals with Raynaud’s are strongly advised not to smoke.
          1.7.3.2. Muscle injury. Muscle and tendon tears may occur when a person is cold
          since muscle action is inefficient and may be uncoordinated in concert with joint
          stiffness. An active warm up, sufficiently energetic and prolonged to ensure that the
          whole body is warm, is an effective means for reducing the risk of injury and
          enhancing performance.
          1.7.3.3. Shivering. Cold causes shivering that can produce a performance deficit in
          manual skills that require steadiness.
MACDILLAFBI48-102 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                5


           1.7.3.4. Reduced Manual Dexterity. The fingers are much less sensitive in the cold
           with subsequent loss of manual dexterity. Cold impairs coordination, reduces visual
           acuity, general alertness, and slows reflexes. Individuals are prone to making
           mistakes in the cold and may misinterpret sights or sounds. Prolonged hypoxia or
           exposure to cold can cause hallucinations, particularly at altitude.
2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. Commanders/Supervisors:
       2.1.1. Ensure personnel take heat stress preventive measures during the summer months
       and especially when the WBGT index reaches or exceeds 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Ensure
       that first line supervisors brief all personnel on an annual basis and prior to all exercises
       on heat stress prevention using the guidance in Attachment 2. Add heat stress
       hazards/training to workers on AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record.
       2.1.2. During the hot season, schedule physical conditioning and strenuous activities
       early in the day or late in the afternoon.
   2.2. Wing Command Post (6 AMW/CP): Advises base organizations of the onset and
   conclusion of heat stress conditions. This is to be accomplished via base wide email
   notification, a pop-up window from the MacDill AFB Emergency Notification System on
   base computer workstations, or via land-mobile radio message to group commanders.
   2.3. Public Health (PH):
       2.3.1. Contacts Bioenvironmental Engineering about any patient with heat stress injuries
       found during normal surveillance for investigation and recommendations.
       2.3.2. Provides guidance and training on controlling heat stress during normal job-related
       functions at the request of the supervisor. The heat stress briefing (Attachment 2) is
       provided for use by first line supervisors in briefing their personnel annually and prior to
       all exercises.
       2.3.3. Upon the request of the commander, PH will provide a heat stress briefing to
       personnel who have the potential (occupational, recreational, deployment, etc.) of
       exposure to high-temperature environments.
   2.4. Bioenvironmental Engineering:
       2.4.1. Investigates the impact of heat stress on industrial workers required to wear
       personal protective equipment.
       2.4.2. Monitors the WBGT hourly based on local climate conditions, 1 May through 1
       October, from 0800 hours until 1600 hours local time, Monday through Friday, unless
       inclement weather prevails. Additional monitoring may be accomplished before 1 May
       or after 1 October as necessitated by heat stress conditions.
       2.4.3. Determines the onset and conclusion of heat stress conditions and reports findings
       to 6 AMW/CP at Defense Switched Network (DSN) 968-4361 or Commercial 813-828-
       4361. Notifications will be made at any time when the heat category changes. Once the
       final reading is taken at 1600 hours local time Monday through Friday, the heat category
       at that time will be in effect until sunset.

        2.4.4. Investigates heat stress injuries through completion of AF Form 190, Occupational
        Illness/Injury Report, and inputs the data into the Air Force Safety Automated System
        (AFSAS). Also makes recommendations to the appropriate commander/supervisor on
        further prevention of heat stress injuries in their unit.
        2.4.5. Advises commanders/supervisors on heat and cold stress preventive measures.
        2.4.6. Remains responsible for the determination of the Wind Chill Index zones in
        accordance with AFPAM 48-151.
     2.5. 6th Force Support Squadron: The Fitness Center will provide notice to all patrons of
     current heat and cold stress category.
     2.6. 6th Operations Support Squadron, Weather Flight:
        2.6.1. Weather in conjunction with the Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight can
        determine jointly the Fighter Index of Thermal Stress (FITS) based upon the WBGT and
        guidance in AFPAM 48-151. FITS provides a measure of the thermal stress experienced
        by aircrew in fast jet aircraft with canopies and environmental control systems, engaged
        in combat sorties at low level altitude.
3. Individual Factors Affecting Heat Stress or Increasing Potential for Heat Stress. There
is wide variation in human tolerance to heat stress. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify factors
that cause particular individuals to become heat casualties. The following personal factors must
be considered when assessing individual heat injury risk:
     3.1. Concurrent mild illness, e.g., diarrhea, viral illness, fever, including reactions to
     immunizations.
        3.1.1. Inadequate acclimatization (2 hours/day of sweat work for 7 to 10 days are
        necessary). The process means you sweat more profusely and conserve more salt in your
        kidneys.
        3.1.2. Obesity.
        3.1.3. Lack of physical fitness and/or lack of sleep.
        3.1.4. Recent alcohol intake.
        3.1.5. Dehydration.
        3.1.6. Medication or illegal drugs.
        3.1.7. Lack of meals.
        3.1.8. Previous heat/cold injury.
4. Preventive Measures. The following preventive measures are a guide to preventing heat
stress. These measures provide some information for commanders and should not be construed
as directive.
     4.1. Prior to Exercise/Deployment/Work:
        4.1.1. Condition for acclimatization. Need at least 2 hours each day for 7 to 10 days.
        4.1.2. Accomplish all immunizations at least 7 days prior to exercise.
    MACDILLAFBI48-102 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                7


             4.1.3. Screen out individuals with even minor illness, particularly any vomiting or
             diarrhea in the past 2-3 days, and pregnant women.
             4.1.4. Be rested; 12 hours of rest/8 hours of sleep.
             4.1.5. No alcohol 24 hours prior to working in hot climate.
             4.1.6. Prehydrate before work; drink at least one quart of water.
             4.1.7. Brief personnel on Attachment 2.
             4.1.8. Identify individuals at higher risk (i.e., previous heat/cold injury).
          4.2. During Exercise/Deployment/Work:
             4.2.1. After air transport, replace water loss in flight (one quart for every four hours in
             flight).
             4.2.2. Provide sufficient water cooled to at least 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
             4.2.3. Bioenvironmental Engineering can provide you with current WBGT readings.
             During deployments, the independent duty medical technician or equivalent should
             perform the WBGT readings using the WBGT kit, National Stock Number (NSN) 6665-
             00-159-2218 or other approved instrument.

     This regimen ONLY applies to OUTDOOR activities in direct sunlight. These heat categories are
     consistent with those in the Airman’s Manual (AFMAN 10-100) and the Training Guidelines for
     Acclimatized Personnel in AFPAM 48-151, Thermal Injury.
     Notes:
     1. If wearing MOPP Level 4, add 10°F to Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT). If wearing
     personal body armor in humid climates, add 5°F to WBGT.
     2. Rest means minimal physical activity (sitting or standing), accomplished in shade if possible.
     3. Caution: Daily fluid intake should not exceed 12 quarts. Hourly fluid intake should not
     exceed 1 quart. The work/rest time and fluid replacement volumes will sustain performance and
     hydration for at least 4 hours of work in the specified work category. Individual water needs
     may vary +/- 0.25 qt/hr.

5. Symptoms of Heat Stress and Emergency Actions. Heat stress symptoms include one or
more of the following: headaches, dizziness, faintness, nausea, vomiting, fever, profuse or
decreased sweating, cramps, convulsions, lack of coordination, and unconsciousness.
   5.1. Heat Stroke is a MEDICAL EMERGENCY. Immediately call an ambulance (911)
   while simultaneously conducting rapid active cooling measures (remove victim to cool shady
   place, remove clothing, keep skin moist). Active cooling should be discontinued when the
   rectal temperature reaches 101 degrees Fahrenheit to avoid hypothermia.
   5.2. General Measures for Common Signs/Symptoms of Heat Injury (dizziness, headache,
   nausea, weakness, muscle cramps, fatigue, chills):
       5.2.1. Move individual to a cooler (not cold) location or into a shaded area and spray
       with water.
       5.2.2. Loosen clothing.
       5.2.3. Take sips of water.
   5.3. General Measures for Serious Signs/Symptoms of Heat Injury (hot body, high
   temperature, confusion, vomiting, convulsions, weak/rapid pulse, unresponsiveness):
       5.3.1. Immediately call an ambulance (911).
       5.3.2. Lay person down in shade with feet elevated until medical evacuation or
       ambulance arrives.
       5.3.3. Undress as much as possible.
       5.3.4. Pour cool water over the person and fan.
       5.3.5. Cool by best means available (water immersion or ice sheets/packs).
       5.3.6. Give sips of water if conscious.
       5.3.7. Monitor airway and breathing.
       5.3.8. If the victim does not respond to the above, immediately call an ambulance (911).
       Give your name and location of the victim (building number and street). If an ambulance
       is not available, take the victim to the nearest available medical treatment facility.
6. Factors Affecting Cold Stress or Increasing Potential for Cold Stress. Systematic reviews
of accidental cold injuries have identified the following individual risk factors in a cold
environment and must be considered:
   6.1. Alcohol.
       6.1.1. Psychotropic medication.
       6.1.2. Insufficient clothing.
       6.1.3. Wetness from either the environment or sweat.
       6.1.4. Lean body mass.
       6.1.5. Physical exhaustion.
       6.1.6. Concomitant illness.

       6.1.7. Previous cold injury.
7. Preventive Measures for Cold Exposure. Advisory work/rest schedules and practices in a
cold environment are shown in Paragraph 7.3., Working Practice Guidance in Cold Environment.
Moreover, the following may reduce cold exposure:
   7.1. Elimination of nonessential outdoor tasks.
       7.1.1. When possible, performing tasks indoors.
       7.1.2. Provision of temporary shelter for essential outdoor work, preferably heated, or
       provision for a warming tent.
       7.1.3. Increasing the number of personnel allocated to a task and operating a rotational
       duty system.
       7.1.4. Layered protective clothing systems are available to both aircrew and ground
       crew.
       7.1.5. Workload and Fluid Intake in Cold Environments. In cold environments, the
       principle routes of fluid loss and subsequent deficit are cold induced diuresis, respiratory
       water loss, cold weather clothing, and the metabolic cost of movement and reduced fluid
       intake. Theoretically, glycerol solutions may be appropriate fluid replacement in cold
       environments to delay gastric emptying and promote fluid absorption, however, this area
       requires further study. Personnel are to be encouraged to stay hydrated and consume
       meals.
   7.2. Working Practice Guidance in Cold Environment.
       7.2.1. Standard (35°F). Wear gloves and cover metal handles and bars with thermal
       insulation.
       7.2.2. Moderate (20° to 30°F). Follow standard precautions, no outdoor operations with
       water (vehicle/aircraft washing), wear gloves and total body protection, avoid heavy
       sweating, change wet clothes immediately, implement the ‘buddy’ system. (50
       MINUTES WORK/20 MINUTES WARMING.)
       7.2.3. Caution (-20° to 20°F). Follow both Standard and Moderate precautions, wear
       mittens not gloves. (40 MINUTES WORK/20 MINUTES WARMING.)
       7.2.4. Danger (-50° to -20°F). Follow Standard through Caution actions. (30 MINUTES
       WORK/30 MINUTES WARMING.)
       7.2.5. Extreme (<-50°F). MISSION CRITICAL WORK ONLY. (The Unit Commander
       will determine which tasks are mission critical.)
8. Symptoms of Cold Stress and Emergency Actions. If body heat loss exceeds heat
production, hypothermia will develop. The condition is defined as occurring when the body’s
core temperature falls to 95 degrees Fahrenheit or below. Recognizing the early signs and
symptoms of hypothermia is the key to treatment and management. These include:
   8.1. Symptoms:
       8.1.1. Profound shivering.
       8.1.2. Slurred speech.
MACDILLAFBI48-102 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                             11


     8.1.3. Psychological symptoms including aggressive or withdrawn behavior.
     8.1.4. Progressive reduction in the shivering response and loss of consciousness.
  8.2. Treatment: Remove the person from the cold environment and allow the affected body
  part to rewarm spontaneously. After rewarming, the feet become hyperemic, hot, and red
  with paraesthesia or pain, often similar to electric shocks. These symptoms may be severe
  and last for several weeks, especially on weight bearing. Severe cases produce bleeding into
  the skin, ulceration, and blistering that may progress to gangrene. Consequent to nerve and
  other tissue damage, there is likely to be persistent or permanent hypersensitivity to cold with
  anesthesia or hyperaesthesia or problems with the bony structure of the feet.

       day.
       A2.3.2.2. Provide 3 meals per day to ensure salt and mineral replacement.
MACDILLAFBI48-102 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               15


       A2.3.2.3. Provide shade/warm area for rest cycles. Personnel should not lie down on hot
       ground or pavement.
       A2.3.2.4. Ensure personnel wearing the MCU-2P mask during simulations and exercises
       are allowed to remove the mask frequently for water breaks and to allow release of body
       heat through the head.
       A2.3.2.5. Provide cool water and control hydration as follows:
                  WBGT (F)                        QUARTS WATER/HOUR
                  78.0 – 81.9                     0.5-0.75/hr
                  82.0 – 84.9                     0.5-1/hr
                  85.0 – 87.9                     0.75-1/hr
                  88.0 – 89.9                     0.75-1/hr
                  >90.0                           1.0/hr
       A2.3.2.6. Work/rest cycles should be adjusted dependent upon changes in temperature,
       humidity, wind speed, and solar radiant heat (cloud cover) to decrease the risks of
       heat/cold stress during inclimate weather. During these rest cycles, it is important that, if
       personnel are wearing chemical gear, they remove it to dissipate body heat.
A2.4. Heat Stress Symptoms. Headaches, dizziness, faintness, nausea, vomiting, fever,
profuse or decreased sweating, cramps, convulsion, lack of coordination, and unconsciousness.
A2.5. Emergency Actions. Heat Stroke is a MEDICAL EMERGENCY. Immediately call an
ambulance (911) while simultaneously conducting rapid active cooling measures (remove victim
to cool shady place, remove clothing, keep skin moist). Active cooling should be discontinued
when the rectal temperature reaches 101 degrees Fahrenheit to avoid hypothermia.
   A2.5.1. Move individual to shaded area.
   A2.5.2. Drench victim with water, and fan for additional cooling.
   A2.5.3. Give sips of water if conscious.
   A2.5.4. Monitor airway and breathing.
A2.6. Cold Stress Symptoms. Profound shivering, slurred speech, aggressive or withdrawn
behavior, and progressive reduction in the shivering response and loss of consciousness.
A2.7. Emergency Actions.
   A2.7.1. Remove individual from the cold environment.
   A2.7.2. Allow the affected body part to rewarm, assist with warm, dry blankets and
   additional clothing.
