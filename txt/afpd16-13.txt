This AFPD implements DoD Directive 1300.7, Training and Education Measures Necessary to Support
the Code of Conduct (CoC) and DoD Directive 2310.2, Personnel Recovery. The USAF SERE Program
prepares Low to High Risk of Capture (LRC)/(HRC) personnel to return with honor in direct support of
DOD and A ir Force Personnel Recovery (PR) directives. E nsuring SERE operations and training are a
normalized part of USAF Personnel Recovery plans and programs provides for a well prepared, mission
oriented and m otivated force who are confident in their ability to survive and r eturn with honor. To
accomplish this, the Air Force requires a robust SERE program managed by a SERE Specialist at the
MAJCOM level and co nducted by a well trained, fully manned SERE Specialist force at the f ormal
schools and select operational units. This directive establishes policies for the conduct of the USAF SERE
program and identifies the capabilities of SERE Specialists.

1. The USAF SERE program is an integral part of PR. SERE operations and training are designed to pre-
pare and enable combat aircrews and other HRC personnel to survive and return with honor. Initial,
advanced, and recurring SERE training programs provide essential skills and knowledge in support of the
Code of Conduct for all low to high risk of capture personnel. Unit level SERE Code of Conduct Contin-
uation Training (CoCCT) and Evasion and Recovery (E&R) operations support programs must provide a
clear and continual link between initial formal training and actual operations throughout a memberâ€™s
career.

2. SERE Specialists are a critical component of PR and Aircrew Protection programs responsible for pre-
paring designated personnel to s urvive, evade, resist and escape, ultimately resulting in the recovery of
isolated personnel. SERE Specialists develop SERE Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) in support
of operational tasking for theater and Joint Forces Commanders. Air Force SERE Specialists are the only
DoD specialty specifically recruited, trained and employed to conduct SERE operations support and Code
of Conduct Training (CoCT) for the duration of their career. SERE Specialists conduct CoCT and CoCCT
in support of DoD Directive 1300.7, Training and Education Measures Necessary to Support the Code of
Conduct. SERE Specialists are qualified in principles of PR, and uniquely qualified in global SERE TTP
and equipment enabling them to function as subject matter experts (SME) during contingency, wartime
and military operations other than war (MOOTW). SERE Specialist capabilities include but are not lim-
2                                                                         AFPD16-13 1 MARCH 2000

ited to: SME on impact of conditions effecting survival, evasion, conduct after capture and resistance to
exploitation, escape from captivity; wilderness emergency medical technician (EMT); PR Tactics, Tech-
niques, and Procedures (TTP); operational testing support and use of SERE related equipment; basic,
advanced and emergency military parachuting; controller/observer, evader/evader escort during PR exer-
cises.

3. SERE Program requirements are based on the following guidelines:
    3.1. The USAF SERE Program will be conducted IAW DoD Directive 1300.7, Training and Educa-
    tion Measures Necessary to Support the Code of Conduct, DoD Directive 2310.2, Personnel Recovery
    (PR), and CJCSI 3270.01, Personnel Recovery within the Department of Defense. Cooperation
    between SERE, Pararescue, Intelligence, Aircrew Life Support, Egress, Survival Equipment, Aero-
    space Physiology, and legal programs will ensure the success of the USAF SERE Program. Addition-
    ally, the SERE program management should be a coordinated effort facilitated by a 1T0X1, SERE
    Specialist qualified in accordance with AFMAN 36-2108.
    3.2. SERE Specialists will be qualified as a worldwide deployable resource capable of supporting
    operations in any theater as a SME in support of PR/SERE operations.

4. The following responsibilities and authorities are established:
    4.1. The Secretary of the Air Force establishes policy for the SERE Program. H Q USAF/XO has
    functional oversight responsibility for the SERE Program and SERE Specialist career field manage-
    ment. Specifically, HQ USAF/XO will establish and approve guidance pertaining to SERE operations
    and training and the employment of SE RE Specialists. Additionally, HQ USAF/XO will coordinate
    Mission Essential Task Listings and measures to meet SERE Specialist validated requirements and
    update the SERE Specialist Career Field Education and Training Plan.
    4.2. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs, will organize, train and equip aircrew and other identified per-
    sonnel for SERE operations, normalized at both the initial formal training and operational unit levels.
    Additionally, SERE Specialists will be trained and equipped a s required to meet wor ldwide deploy-
    ment taskings and meet qualifications IAW AFI 16-1301, USAF SERE Program.

5. Gaining (supported) commands/units will direct by contingency plan or tasking message, the Unit
Type Code (UTC) requirements for deploying SERE Specialists.

6. This policy applies to all military and civilian Air Force personnel and members of the Air Force
Reserve and Air National Guard involved in PR/SERE activities and planning. SERE Specialists are not
currently integrated into the unit manning positions of the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard.
Specific management of the SERE program and associated activities will be addressed in the SERE AFI
16-1301.

               MEASURING AND DISPLAYING COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY

A2.1. Compliance with Air Force SERE policy will be assessed in three areas: formal initial SERE train-
ing, recurring SERE CoCCT, and SERE operational support programs. These three areas will be evalu-
ated during MAJCOM Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI), MAJCOM specific Inspector General
Inspections, MAJCOM Unit Compliance Inspections (UCI), or Functional Inspections. These events will
measure the effectiveness of SERE training and operational support programs. A review of SERE initial
training, continuation training and operational mission support will indicate compliance with policies.
The reporting requirements in paragraph A2.1.1. through A2.1.4. of this directive are exempt from
licensing in accordance with paragraph 2.11.12 of AFI 37-124, The Information Collection and Reports
Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public and Interagency Air Force Information Collection.
   A2.1.1. Initial SERE Training Programs. HQ AETC will report all results of ORI evaluations (figure
   A2.1) of courses S-V80-A, S-V84-A, S-V86-A, S-V87-A, S-V90-A, MT-220, and USAFSAM/SERE
   to HQ USAF/XOOP. These evaluations will be conducted at least biennially.
   A2.1.2. Initial SERE Training Programs. The Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) will report
   results of all Executive Agent Instruction (EAI) formal evaluations of course S-V80-A to HQ USAF/
   XOOP.
   A2.1.3. SERE CoCCT Programs. M AJCOM SERE Functional Managers will compile an annual
   report of MAJCOM evaluations involving SERE CoCCT programs and forward to HQ USAF/XOOP.
   A2.1.4. SERE Operational Support Programs. MAJCOM SERE Functional Managers will compile
   an annual report of MAJCOM evaluations of SERE Operational Support Programs and forward to HQ
   USAF/XOOP.
