                               COURSE ADMINISTRATION

2.1. Course Management. FTUs are responsible for course administration. When training is
supported by a contract, the FTU will verify that contract instructors are qualified IAW the
performance work statement (PWS). Otherwise, the training unit will assign a primary and
alternate instructor to each block of instruction in a course. Only qualified instructors will
conduct instruction. See instructor qualification in paragraph 2.3.
2.2. Course Manager. The training unit will assign a course manager for each academic
course. In addition to FTU guidance, the course manager will:
   2.2.1. Provide instruction using only current, HQ ACC/A3-approved formal operations
   training syllabi.
   2.2.2. Prepare and maintain a master file of lesson plans for each course of instruction.
   2.2.3. Coordinate proposed changes in syllabus/lesson plan content with the OTD team and
   the ACC weapon system FAM.
   2.2.4. Follow procedures in ACCI 36-2252 for changes to syllabi and training task lists.
   2.2.5. Use syllabus course training standards and appropriate supporting objectives in lesson
   plans.
   2.2.6. Review TTL, syllabi and course materials for currency at least once every 24 months
   or sooner if required by contract specifications or weapon system changes.
   2.2.7. Verify that courseware complies with Air Force ISD specifications in AFMAN 36-
   2234, AFH 36-2235V8, AFMAN 36-2236 other applicable references and Chapter 6 of this
   instruction.
   2.2.8. Safeguard written, hard-copy exams in a locked container and computer-generated
   exams in a password-protected program to prevent compromise.
2.3. Academic Instructor Qualifications.
   2.3.1. Each wing is responsible for defining specific qualification and training requirements
   for their academic training instructors for wing managed programs (i.e., instructors actually
   conducting classroom training).
   2.3.2. Prior to performing academic training instructor duty for a formal HQ ACC/A3-
   approved syllabus, instructors will have received training in effective listening and
   communication, learning theory, instructional system development, developing objectives
   and lesson plans, questioning techniques, instructional aides, student-centered instruction,
   instructional methodology, instructor fundamentals, classroom management, and tests and
   measurement. Viable options for satisfying this training requirement include:
       2.3.2.1. Send academic instructor candidates to the ACC Classroom Instructor Course
       (CIC) conducted by 436 TS, Dyess AFB TX. This 5-day course is HQ ACC/A3-
       approved, ACC-funded, CCAF accredited, and satisfies the requirements as a formal
       instructor methodology course listed in ETCA.

                              EVALUATING INSTRUCTION

3.1. General. The quality and effectiveness of operations training instruction must be
evaluated. Quality and effectiveness of instruction are evaluated through regular, periodic
monitoring of classroom instruction, review of student testing results, feedback from instructors
and review of other internal and external evaluation data. ACC weapon system FAMs, training
units and OTD teams use information from internal and external evaluations to continually
improve the quality and effectiveness of the training system to prepare graduates to meet job
performance requirements. Note: The 436 TS will follow an evaluation process designed to fit
its unique needs. A detailed description of this process is outlined in 436 TS- OI 36-2234.
3.2. Internal Evaluations. Internal evaluations ascertain the effectiveness and quality of a
training course by administering student examinations, gathering student evaluations of training,
reviewing course control documents such as syllabi and courseware, and evaluating instructor
performance. As a minimum each instructor will be evaluated annually. Instructor evaluations
should be part of instructor development and a continuous process.
   3.2.1. End-of-Course Questionnaires. Student evaluations of training include completion of
   an end-of-course questionnaire covering academics, aircrew device training, and actual flying
   sorties. Questionnaires will contain numerical ratings for use in trend analysis and are
   developed by the training unit and/or contractors according to AFMAN 36-2236, AFMAN
   36-2234, and AFH 36-2235 series guidelines. Training units and/or contractors gather
   questionnaires and continuously analyze data with OTD team assistance as appropriate. All
   communication with contractors should go through the appointed Government Trained
   (GT)/SME. Training units and/or contractors will distribute analysis results locally (FTU/CC,
   OG/CC, OTD team, etc.) and may forward results to the syllabus OPR (ACC weapon system
   FAM). If the analysis indicates syllabus modifications are needed, the syllabus OPR, OTD
   team and training unit, as applicable, will coordinate on the modifications and present them
   at the next SRB. If an out-of-cycle syllabus revision is deemed necessary by the weapon
   system FAM, the OTD team will prepare the syllabus change IAW ACCI 36-2252.
   3.2.2. Student Examinations. Instructors qualified in the subject area administer student
   examinations. Instructors will evaluate all students to ensure they have achieved course
   objectives. Test questions will be developed using specifications in AFMAN 36-2234,
   AFH 362235V8 and V12, and AFMAN 36-2236. The minimum passing score for written
   examinations is 85 percent. Individuals who fail a test will receive additional instruction and
   be scheduled for retesting no earlier than 1 day after the initial failure. Exceptions: Due to
   the unique requirements within the administrator career fields, the 505 TRS (AOC FTU)
   courses will test to a minimum passing score of 70 percent. Additionally, the USAFWS,
   JAGOG 6 CTS, and 436 TS establish their unique student examination criteria and retesting
   procedures.
   3.2.3. Courseware Reviews. Review all courseware at least once every 24 months, IAW
   paragraph 2.2.6 and contract specifications, if applicable. Reviews are conducted by training
   unit instructors, contracted instructors, OTD team members and others as appropriate.
 20                                                                   ACCI36-2250 27 JUNE 2014


         3.2.3.1. Thoroughly review courseware for accuracy, quality and effectiveness of design.
         Courseware reviews during actual lesson delivery may be used to assess courseware
         training objectives and lesson medium selection. All reviews will be documented. Follow
         guidance in AFMAN 36-2236, AFMAN 36-2234 and AFH 36-2235.
         3.2.3.2. OTD teams will request, as a minimum, annual user feedback on OTD team-
         developed training courseware used in the operational environment.
      3.2.4. Instructor Performance.
         3.2.4.1. Each wing is responsible for defining specific instructor performance criteria and
         developing corresponding instructor evaluation forms for the academic platform training
         instructors for their MDS. Instructor performance will be evaluated by wing-appointed
         instructor evaluators or, in the case of contract instructor, by government training/subject
         matter expert (GT/SME) personnel assigned under the supporting CAT/CWD contract, as
         appropriate.     Evaluators should have successfully completed instructor training
         themselves and must use a unit-/contract-approved evaluation form. If the quality of an
         instructor's performance is unacceptable (less than satisfactory in any area of the
         evaluation), the chief of academics or appropriate flight commander is notified and will
         take appropriate action. In the case of contracted instructors, critiques will be given to the
         GT/SME for action.
         3.2.4.2. Minimum Frequency of Instructor Evaluation.
             3.2.4.2.1. Current instructors with more than one year of formal instructor experience
             will have evaluations at least annually.
             3.2.4.2.2. Instructors with prior formal instructor experience (one year or more)
             should have one evaluation within the first month after completion of subject matter
             qualification training (as prescribed by the wing), and at least annually thereafter.
             3.2.4.2.3. Newly assigned instructors without prior formal instructor experience
             should have at least three monthly evaluations for the three months following
             completion of instructor and subject matter qualification training (as prescribed by the
             wing), then quarterly for the next three quarters, and then at least annually thereafter.
3.3. External Evaluations. External evaluations assess the quality of the training the graduate
received based on how well students meet job performance requirements in an operational
environment.
      3.3.1. Graduate Evaluation Program. OTD teams will establish a Graduate Evaluation
      Program for their specific weapon system. The Graduate Evaluation Program consists of
      graduate and supervisor feedback based on surveys, personal interviews and other external
      evaluation data sources such as mishap reports, standardization and evaluation reports, IG
      reports, accident reports, training requirement meetings, etc. Individual evaluation programs
      and methods used may be tailored to meet the needs of specific weapon systems, but must
      follow the guidelines stated in this instruction. Attachment 8 is a schematic of the overall
      graduate evaluation process.
         3.3.1.1. OTD Teams. OTD teams will evaluate graduates 3 to 6 months after completing
         training when using questionnaires. This allows for leave and travel time and gives
         supervisors time to observe and analyze the graduate's performance and make
ACCI36-2250 27 JUNE 2014                                                                     21


     determinations concerning how well graduates are performing following training.
     Surveying within 180 days after graduation helps differentiate performance resulting
     from FTU training from subsequent operational unit training. ACC TRSS/TDF may
     approve earlier sampling times for units with unique requirements.
     3.3.1.2. Formal Training Units. FTUs will establish procedures for participating in the
     Graduate Evaluation Program and assist the OTD team as requested. Within 30 days
     following graduation, FTUs will forward a roster of formal course graduates to the
     appropriate OTD team to initiate the graduate evaluation process. These rosters will
     include name, rank, gaining unit, crew position, class designation, appropriate syllabus
     designation, graduation date, plus any other information requested by the OTD team.
     3.3.1.3. MAJCOMs, NAFs and Wings. MAJCOMs, NAFs and wings will provide
     assistance to OTD teams to ensure maximum participation in Graduate Evaluation
     Programs. The operations group commander will provide a POC within each operational
     unit to assist the OTD team in implementing the Graduate Evaluation Program and
     ensuring formal course graduates and their supervisors complete and return graduate
     evaluation questionnaires. Operational unit POCs will ensure distribution of
     questionnaires and return of all questionnaires IAW OTD team guidance, as well as
     provide support for OTD team field evaluation visits and other data collection efforts, as
     required.
  3.3.2. Graduate Evaluation Questionnaire Process.
     3.3.2.1. Separate questionnaires are developed for graduates and supervisors. The
     questionnaires will be developed IAW AFMAN 36-2234, AFH 36-2235, and
     Attachment 9. Questionnaires will include rating scales verbatim as shown in
     Attachment 11. OTD teams will distribute questionnaires to graduates and supervisors.
     Note that a “supervisor” does not need to be an individual in the graduate’s direct chain
     of command, but rather it is the individual with the most knowledge of the graduate’s
     mission task performance. Comments for ratings "0" and "4" are required, comments for
     ratings "1" and "3" are highly desired, and for "2" are optional. Graduate or supervisor
     questionnaires will not be sent to ranks O-6 and above.
     3.3.2.2. Graduate questionnaires should evaluate how well academic training, device
     training, and flying training, as applicable, prepared the graduate to perform specific
     mission tasks. It should solicit additional information through written comments. Send
     surveys to all graduates with the exception of ranks O-6 and above.
     3.3.2.3. Supervisor questionnaires should evaluate how well the training prepared the
     graduate to perform specific mission tasks for follow on training or weapon systems
     employment. It should also solicit additional information through written comments.
     While it is desired that a supervisor complete a questionnaire for each graduate, alternate
     supervisory sampling methods are authorized and may include surveying by graduating
     class or periodic time period (i.e., quarterly), or may include alternate methods such as
     interviews, telephone survey or “side-bars”. Regardless of method of delivery, every
     effort should be made to have surveys sent out at the same predetermined time. Send
     surveys to all graduates with the exception of ranks O-6 and above.
22                                                                   ACCI36-2250 27 JUNE 2014


        3.3.2.4. Questionnaire validity and success depend on an effective Graduate Evaluation
        Program, a high questionnaire return rate, and the thoroughness and sincerity of graduates
        and supervisors providing the feedback. See paragraph 3.3.1.3 detailing assistance
        provided by NAF/wing POCs.
        3.3.2.5. OTD teams and contractors, where applicable, analyze Graduate Evaluation
        questionnaires and data from other sources, comparing graduate performance with course
        standards and training objectives. Use guidance in AFMAN 36-2236, AFMAN 36-2234
        and AFH 36-2235 to analyze all data. Factors to consider include population, sample size,
        the number and quality of graduate/supervisor questionnaire responses and information
        from other relevant sources. Monitor data for trends occurring over two or more classes
        and for evidence of inadequate or excessive training. Consolidated questionnaire
        responses are considered relevant when 10 percent (or more) of the numerical or written
        responses for a particular item reflect the same rating on the rating scale (0 to 4). All
        training items with a 10 percent (or more) rating of either "0" or "4", and all validated or
        relevant written comments will be explained in the graduate evaluation report, to include
        corrective action taken or recommended.
     3.3.3. Field Visits. The purpose of a field visit is to validate findings collected via data
     analysis from some collection method. Field visits are arranged and conducted by OTD team
     members, preferably an experienced SME and an Education and Training professional, who
     will visit operational units as deemed necessary depending on the state of training, and/or
     evaluation feedback suggesting a field visit is necessary. OTD teams will submit field visit
     requests to ACC TRSS/TDF for TRSS/CC approval at least 30 days in advance of the field
     visit.
        3.3.3.1. Survey data can be used, among other factors such as safety issues and other
        compelling matters related to training to justify a field visit. When survey data is used as
        a basis for a field visit, evidence of at least a 10% dissatisfaction rate on any survey rated
        element must be presented along with the field visit request. The ACC Graduate
        Evaluation Program POC may accompany teams on field visits with approval of the TDF
        Flight Commander and ACC TRSS/CC. See Attachment 13 for an example of a field
        visit notification memorandum.
        3.3.3.2. To enhance the effectiveness of field visits, OTD team members are encouraged
        to participate in part-task and full-mission training experiences in training devices and on
        actual flying missions, as an observer.
        3.3.3.3. Submit a trip report to ACC TRSS/CC, ACC TRSS/TDF, the unit visited and
        other local offices such as the FTU OG/CC and the FTU. Reports will include visit dates,
        units and personnel visited, observations, specific discussion items and any recommended
        actions. See Attachment 13 for an example of a field visit report.
     3.3.4. Alternative Data Gathering Methods. Alternative data gathering methods may be used
     to meet specific evaluation needs when most appropriate. Alternative methods can include
     but are not limited to message formatted open- and closed-questions to units, interviewing
     newly arrived/upgraded instructors from the field and telephone inquiry techniques.
     Additional sources of potential information include student critiques, IG reports, accident
     reports, stan/eval reports and training requirement meetings.
ACCI36-2250 27 JUNE 2014                                                                           23


3.4. Graduate Evaluation Report (GER) (RCS: ACC-OTD (AR) 8102):
   3.4.1. The GER is a summary and analysis of training data gathered from graduate and
   supervisor questionnaires, field visits, student critiques, IG reports, accident reports, stan/eval
   reports, training requirement meetings, etc. The GER serves to close the feedback loop with
   graduates, supervisors, responsible training units and headquarters, keeps associate units
   informed of training system issues, facilitates preparation of necessary syllabus changes,
   provides weapon systems FAMs the opportunity to respond to issues and recommendations,
   and assures associate units that training developers are listening to their concerns.
   3.4.2. OTD Graduate Evaluation Program Manger (GEPM) will compile all data into a GER
   prior to the biennial SRB or sooner if required due to weapon system, syllabus, and
   courseware changes or preliminary analysis of incoming graduate evaluation data. GERs are
   due to ACC TRSS/TDF 60 days prior to the scheduled SRB. The GER review is a mandatory
   agenda item for SRBs and will be included in the SRB minutes.
      3.4.2.1. When a syllabus is rescinded, submit a closeout GER 6 months following
      graduation of the last class trained under the rescinded syllabus, or 30 days after the
      syllabus is rescinded, whichever is later. Contact ACC TRSS/TDF with questions
      concerning GER validity/requirements on rescinded syllabi.
      3.4.2.2. Submit a Letter of No Report to ACC TRSS/TDF when no classes have been
      taught or there are no graduates to survey during the graduate evaluation period.
   3.4.3. Follow the GER format and guidance found in Attachment 10, Attachment 11 and
   Attachment 12. Mark each page of the GER “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY." Include a
   distribution page that lists the syllabus OPR (ACC division of the weapon system FAM),
   MAJCOMs, NAFs, FTUs and operational units affiliated with the OTD team that are
   receiving the report.
   3.4.4. Upon receipt of the GER from the OTD team, ACC TRSS/TDF will review the report
   for completeness, accuracy and format. All GERs not following the format and guidance
   found in Attachment 10, Attachment 11, and Attachment 12 will be returned to the OTD
   team for correction. Once approved by the ACC TRSS/CC, ACC TRSS Command Section
   will forward the approved GER to the ACC weapon system FAM and applicable ACC
   division. ACC TRSS/TDF will send a copy of the approved GER to the OTD team.
   3.4.5. The OTD team will distribute the approved GER locally, according to the distribution
   page. File the GER in the syllabus record set and retain copies of the last three GERs for
   each formal course to assess trends resulting from syllabus changes.
   3.4.6. The syllabus OPR will review the GER and use it to implement syllabus modifications
   at the SRB (or earlier depending on the criticality of the information).

                                    BUDGET AND FUNDING

4.1. Funds Distribution. ACC TRSS provides funding for TRSS detachments. Funds allocated
to detachments are centrally managed by ACC TRSS, with TRSS/CC having overall
responsibility for TRSS detachment funding. Detachment commanders are empowered to
control and move funds from one element of expense and investment code (EEIC) to another, as
required for mission accomplishment. ACC TRSS and each detachment will develop a spending
plan to ensure spending remains within the allocated budget and ensure funds are not withheld or
redistributed to other agencies in host wings.
4.2. ACC TRSS Responsibilities. ACC TRSS notifies the detachments of ACC TRSS/CC
approval or disapproval of execution plans. ACC TRSS will:
      4.2.1. Appoint a squadron resource advisor (RA) and alternate to provide budget oversight

         COMPUTER-BASED TRAINING (CBT)/COURSEWARE MANAGEMENT

5.1. General. ACC TRSS is tasked by HQ ACC/A3 to initiate, develop, distribute and maintain
CBT programs to provide initial qualification, mission qualification, upgrade and requalification
training for ACC FTUs, and continuation training (CT) programs for distribution CAF-wide.
ACC TRSS accomplishes this by using civilian contractor and government development teams to
build and maintain training programs. The following paragraphs explain in greater detail the
responsibilities of civilian contractors and government development teams, and detail the correct
way to label CBT products. Figure 5.1 outlines ACC TRSS training options available to meet
the training requirements for today's CAF warfighter.

                      Briefing          Instructor-Led           Briefing

      5.1.1. Government Roles and Responsibilities. The government's role in CBT development
      is to establish the requirement, set the initial development philosophy, generate standards,
      ensure configuration requirements are maintained, build and maintain non-contractor CBT
      products, ensure all CBTs meet customer requirements, and act as the focal point to the CAF
      for all FTU program training needs. The ACC TRSS commander delegates CBT approval to
      the detachment commander requesting the CBT development, unless specifically withheld in
      the ACC TRSS CBT tasking letter (i.e., for continuation training support and command
      product support projects).
      5.1.2. Contractor Roles and Responsibilities. Contractors follow existing requirements as
      stated in their respective contract. Their roles and responsibilities are clearly defined within
      that contract. They are the continuity to the CBT/CWD cycle.
      5.1.3. Instructional System Development (ISD) Process. All CBTs, whether government or
      contractor designed and developed, will be developed following the ISD process.
      Information and guidance for designers of instructional systems on how and under what
      conditions to incorporate training technologies into the ISD process can be found in AFMAN
ACCI36-2250 27 JUNE 2014                                                                         27


    36-2234, AFH 36-2235V5, and AFMAN 36-2236. This guidance addresses the use of
    instructional technologies in both resident and nonresident instructional systems.
    5.1.4. Categories of Training. ACC TRSS categorizes training products as follows:

Table 5.1. Categories of Training.
      Category                 Product/Topic                            Customer
         FTU            FTU support                      ACC schoolhouses
         OPS            Operational training support     CAF operational squadrons
         CT             Continuation training support    Follow-on topics for operations
         CP             Command product support          Generic topics applicable command-or
                                                         Air Force-wide

    5.1.5. CT Development. CT topics produced through CAT/CWD contracts will normally be
    designed as a level 2 interactive CBT or higher and will focus primarily on advanced
    training. Prior to the Realistic Training Review Board (RTRB) convening annually, ACC
    OG/CCs and all CAF MAJCOMs are solicited for inputs that affect aircrew training, to
    include CT topics. The CT topic is discussed during the RTRB and, if deemed necessary is
    tasked to the appropriate agency to develop.
5.2. Levels of Interactivity. This paragraph defines the various levels of interactivity and
outlines necessary components that must exist at each level. It is important to note that the "cost"
of CBT development, both in terms of contract dollars or government man-hours spent building
each product, increases as the level of interactivity increases. Current AFH 36-2235V5 outlines
the various types of instructional technology capabilities from traditional media to internet-based
instruction. The following paragraphs assist the casual user by outlining capabilities and
limitations that currently exist with ACC TRSS training products.

      5.2.1. Passive Participation Level 1 – Baseline Presentation. This is the lowest level of
      interactive courseware development. In Level 1, the learner receives information. The
      media used are primarily text and graphics (not complex). This level is used primarily to
      introduce knowledge, including ideas, concepts, and processes. Information is generally
      provided in a linear format (one idea after another). Minimal interactivity is incorporated in
      the form of text, navigational icons, static graphics (e.g., photos, charts, tables) and
      illustrations, learner-initiated animations, pop-ups and hyperlinks, and simple assessment
      questions.
      5.2.2. Limited Participation Level 2 – Medium Simulation Presentation. This presentation
      level involves the recall of more information that a basic level 1 presentation. There is more
      interaction such as using a light pen to rotate a switch. Level 2 normally combines audio,
      video, text, graphics and animation.
      5.2.3. Complex Participation Level 3 – High Simulation Presentation. This level involves
      aspects of both level 1 and level 2 while using some of the abilities of ICW. Level 3 may
      present on screen interaction similar to that used in an aircraft simulator. This level provides
      a high degree of interactivity, extensive branching capability, maximum mediation
      opportunity, and real time event simulation with minor equipment limitations, capability to
      interface with other input devices.
5.3. CBT Levels of Interactivity. ACC TRSS CBT programs will be designed around
interactive multimedia instruction (IMI). Interactive multimedia instruction is a term applied to a
group of predominantly interactive, electronically delivered training instruction and training
instruction-support products. IMI is used in the delivery of CBT instructional programs.
Common education and training wisdom defines four levels of CBT interactivity. Those, along
with the Air Force estimate of development hours associated with 1 hour of CBT development at
each level, are delineated in Table 6.3 Note that the development time increases as the level of
learning of the lesson increases.

   5.3.1. Level 1 – Passive Participation. Level 1 CBT is the lowest level of Interactive
   Courseware development. In Level 1, the learner receives information. The media used are
   primarily text and graphics (not complex). This level is used primarily to introduce
   knowledge, including ideas, concepts, and processes. Information is generally provided in a
   linear format (one idea after another). Minimal interactivity is incorporated in the form of
   text, navigational icons, static graphics (e.g. photos, charts, tables) and illustrations, learner-
   initiated animations, pop-ups and hyperlinks, and simple assessment questions.
   5.3.2. Level 2 - Limited Participation. A level 2 CBT lesson has only one logic flow and
   includes drill and practice, feedback on student responses, a summary of what was taught,
   and most importantly evaluates whether the student understood the information presented. If
   a lesson does not test the student on learning objectives, it is not a level 2 CBT. A level 2
   CBT must contain the items listed in Table 6.4 In Level 2, the learner recalls information and
   responds to instructional cues. This level is used to introduce simple operational and
   maintenance guidelines and procedures. Information can be presented in a linear manner, but
   the learner has some control over the presented material. Limited to moderate interactivity is
   incorporated in the form of user-initiated animations, interactive graphics, activities,
   scenarios, and assessments (practices, knowledge checks, and tests).
   5.3.3. Level 3 - Complex Participation. A level 3 CBT incorporates all the attributes of level
   2 ICW, but also provides multiple learning paths and may or may not have some limited real
   time simulation. The biggest difference between a level 2 and level 3 CBT is in the options
   the student has available to them within the branching scheme of the program. Level 3
   lessons provide the student more than one way to learn or understand the teaching point(s). In
   Level 3, the learner applies information to scenarios and interacts with simulations. This
   level is used to present more complex operational and maintenance procedures. Information
   is often non-linear and the learner has moderate control over the presented information.
   Moderate to high interactivity is incorporated in the form of complex interactive graphics
   including simulations and decision-based branched scenarios.
   5.3.4. Level 4 - Real Time Participation. Level 4 lessons include all the characteristics from
   the previous interactivity levels as well as adding the ability for the student to participate in a
   fully operational setting for real time simulation. Level 4 interactive lessons also measure the
   student's ability to react to predictive and performance situations as determined by the CBT
   topic. In Level 4, the learner engages in a life-like set of complex cues and responses. This
   level is used to simulate highly complex operational and maintenance procedures that often
   support certification. Maximum flexibility and multi-level branching allow a high degree of
   interactivity in the form of a simulator and gaming environment.
5.4. Contractor-Produced Courseware. ACC TRSS manages training contracts that use
civilian contractors to produce CBT (Exception: Systems Program Officer (SPO) managed
contracts). In most cases these contractors also perform academic instruction. We refer to this
form of training solution as CAT/CWD.
   5.4.1. General. CAT and/or CWD contracts may be awarded to civilian contractors if the
   training unit, ACC TRSS and HQ ACC/A3 determine this to be effective and efficient.
   5.4.2. Contract Aircrew Training. CAT contracts are individually designed to meet the
   specific needs of students, training units and operational units. These contracts usually
 30                                                                ACCI36-2250 27 JUNE 2014


      include classroom instruction and training device instruction. In some instances, it may also
      include flying training.
      5.4.3. Courseware Development. CWD contracts are designed to meet the specific needs of
      students, training units and operational units. CWD contracts provide new or revised
      instructional products. These contracts may include development of lesson plans, student
      study guides, textbooks, tests, grade sheets, interactive courseware, syllabi, etc.
      5.4.4. CBT Level Requirement. The level of interactivity of a CBT product developed by a
      contractor is determined by the PWS documents contained in each CAT/CWD contract
      awarded. Contractor-developed CBT is normally designated as a level 2 interactive CBT or
      higher and focuses primarily on advanced training requirements. If not specifically stated
      within the contract, the contractor will follow guidance set up in Table 6.4

Table 5.4. Components of a Level 2 CBT.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES must be stated at the beginning of the program.
There must be some STUDENT INTERACTION such as rotating switches, pressing/clicking
on display buttons, filling in information, etc. The fact that the CBT requires a student to press
the enter key or a display screen graphic to move from one screen to another is not student
interaction.
COMPUTER-MANAGED INSTRUCTION (CMI) is used to track student progress
through the lesson, analyze student performance and offer feedback. Recommend after each
teaching point a quiz or questionnaire be presented to the student. Incorrect responses must
include the correct response and feedback to enable the student to leave that subject area
understanding the correct method/approach/response.
Review all key teaching points prior to the end of the lesson in a SUMMARY.
Students must take an END-OF-LESSON TEST (or periodically test at key points
throughout) and achieve a score that meets the academic standards as specified by the syllabus
in order to be considered knowledgeable in the information provided in the lesson.
      5.4.5. Continuation Training (CT) CBT Lesson Validation:
         5.4.5.1. Once the CT topic is developed by the contractor and beta tested, the on-site
         courseware government courseware/subject matter expert (GCW/SME) for that contract
         sends the CBT to ACC TRSS/TDF. ACC TRSS/TDF will validate lesson continuity,
         appropriate security markings, software standards and system operability. ACC
         TRSS/TDF will obtain the designated FAM review and concurrence to validate technical
         accuracy. The ACC TRSS/CC, acting as the direct agent for the HQ ACC/A3, approves
         all CAT/CWD CT courseware. Upon notification of ACC TRSS/CC approval, the
         developing agency will update the course catalog. The developing agency will duplicate
         and distribute all courseware as follows:
             5.4.5.1.1. The ACC TRSS/CC grants approval for release and distribution of
             courseware (to include sylalbi) to any military organization within DoD, at the
             discretion of the distributing detachment commander.
ACCI36-2250 27 JUNE 2014                                                                    31


          5.4.5.1.2. Distribution of courseware (to include syllabi) outside the DoD is not
          authorized without prior approval of the ACC TRSS/CC. Distributing detachments
          will forward request via memorandum for courseware (to include sylalbi) distribution
          outside the DoD to ACC TRSS/TDF for staffing and approval.
      5.4.5.2. FTU Topics. The TRSS detachment GCW/SME validates all CAT/CWD
      courseware IAW the PWS by ensuring lesson continuity, appropriate security markings,
      software standards and system operability are enforced. A SME will validate technical
      accuracy. After validation, the GCW/SME submits courseware to the ACC TRSS
      detachment commander for approval. Upon approval, the product is released to the FTU
      for implementation. The GCW/SME should establish and maintain a courseware
      acceptance/in-work data file for monitoring all CAT/CWD courseware. If the detachment
      CC believes particular CAT/CWD courseware needs command review, contact ACC
      TRSS/TDF for further guidance.
   5.4.5.3. CAT/CWD Acquisition Process. ACC TRSS, SPO and HQ ACC AMIC are OPRs
   for all HQ ACC/A3 acquired contracts. All HQ ACC operational units desiring CAT/CWD
   for aircrew training should notify their weapon system FAM at HQ ACC. Upon approval,
   ACC TRSS will acquire and manage training contracts. Upon approval, SPO will acquire and
   manage training contracts. Training contracts of this type typically require 12-18 months to
   award from the initial tasking date. Units should plan for this time period when making
   manning decisions.
   5.4.6. Contract Program Management. ACC TRSS is the program manager for CAT/CWD
   programs not managed by the SPO. HQ ACC AMIC is the contract administrator for ACC
   TRSS CAT/CWD programs. ACC TRSS provides technical expertise to HQ ACC AMIC to
   satisfy customer requirements. HQ ACC AMIC ensures the contract provides the legal and
   financial means to satisfy customer requirements. ACC TRSS and HQ ACC AMIC work
   together to manage and maintain selected HQ ACC/A3 CAT/CWD contracts.
   5.4.7. For non-TRSS owned CAT/CWD contract(s), the SPO is the contract administrator.
   The SPO may assign Quality Assurance Representatives (QAR) to integrate ACC TRSS and
   local on-site ACC requirements. The SPO will also ensure the contract provides legal and
   financial means to satisfy customer requirements.
5.5. Non-Contractor CBT Development (Government Produced).
   5.5.1. General. Non-contractor CBT development training programs are CBT/CWD projects
   tasked directly from the ACC TRSS/CC to any of its detachments. ACC TRSS detachment
   commanders are required to forward to ACC TRSS/CC any CBT/CWD requests not received
   using this accountability chain.
   5.5.2. Courseware Development. CBT/CWD taskings are designed to meet the specific
   needs of students and training units. These CBT programs provide new instructional
   materials and will be fully supported until the requestor no longer needs the training
   program. Each detachment receiving a tasking will provide the name(s) of the detachment
   POC and an estimated development start date to the ACC TRSS/TDF within 3 workdays.
   5.5.3. CBT Level Requirement. The level of interactivity of a CBT for a requested topic for
   government-developed projects is determined by the ISD analysis conducted by that
   detachment's education and training professional. If CBT is determined to be the best method
 32                                                                  ACCI36-2250 27 JUNE 2014


      for providing instruction on the topic, the detachment OTD team will follow existing
      guidance outlined within this chapter. Detachment development teams (with the exception of
      Det 1 and 8) that are supported by CAT/CWD contracts can build level 1 training products
      only. If the ISD needs analysis proposes a level 2 or higher solution approach, then the
      developing detachment must seek support/approval from ACC TRSS, who will task out that
      project to either Detachment 1 or 8 for development.
      5.5.4. CBT Lesson Validation.
         5.5.4.1. Detachments will ensure that CBTs are only developed when supported by
         training requirements in the current TTL or syllabus. If the training requirements are not
         specified in either of these documents, the detachment cannot develop the CBT until the
         TTL and syllabus have been amended to reflect the training requirement. CBTs
         developed that are not tied to a training requirement are considered a one-time build and
         is not supported by the TRSS after delivery.
         5.5.4.2. For lessons to be used solely within the local FTU community and not
         distributed further, the ACC TRSS detachment commander is the final approval
         authority. The OTD team is responsible for reproduction and distribution, if not provided
         for in TRSS tasking letter.
         5.5.4.3. For lessons to be distributed outside of the local FTU community, the completed,
         beta-tested lesson must be sent to the ACC TRSS/TDF for validation and approval prior
         to final delivery to the end customer. ACC TRSS/TDF will perform an independent
         validation to verify lesson continuity, appropriate security markings, software standards
         and system operability are enforced. TDF will forward the CBT lesson to the appropriate
         ACC weapon system FAM for technical review and formal coordination. ACC

5.7. Classified Distribution. In addition to the requirements for unclassified CBT distribution
listed above, classified CBT products require security validation prior to any distribution.
Classified training products will not be downloaded using the detachment web page unless that
page is self contained inside an authorized SIPRNET file server (base controlled classified web
site). Detachments may advertise the availability of these products on their unclassified military
web sites or electronic courseware catalog. Detachments will authenticate the requester in
writing, and conduct a follow-up telephone call with the requester’s security official, prior to
mailing any classified products. Once authenticated, the detachment should distribute the product
within five workdays to the requestor. If the new product is a revision and the security certificate
is less than 1year from the release date of the CBT product, the detachment does not have to
recertify the security certificate. However, if the security certificate is over a year old, then
 34                                                             ACCI36-2250 27 JUNE 2014


recertification is mandatory. Classified CBTs will be distributed via accountable container and
will use an AF Form 310, Document Receipt and Destruction certificate for tracking purposes. If
the AF Form 310 is not returned within 30 days from its mailing, the detachment will conduct
follow-up action. Once the AF Form 310 is received, it is filed and maintained for the
appropriate time period as outlined within Air Force security guidance. Questions or concerns
should be addressed to ACC TRSS/CCE.

                                           Chapter 6

             AIRCREW TRAINING AID AND DEVICE MANUFACTURING

6.1. General. This chapter defines Aircrew Training Aids (ATA) and Aircrew Training
Devices (ATD) and responsibilities of each agency involved in procurement, maintenance,
transportation, and disposal of ATA/ATDs, and delineates policies governing their local
manufacture and management. Requests for and approval of all training aids will be IAW this
chapter. See Attachment 14 for ATA/ATD evaluation process.
6.2. Aircrew Training Aids (ATA) and Aircrew Training Devices (ATD). An aircrew
training aid is any device used in formal and continuation training programs, manufactured
within the command and not procured by Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). ATA include
charts, photographs, videos, cutaways, models, and mockups. ATD include part-task trainers,
cockpit familiarization trainers, and egress trainers. ATA and ATD are used primarily for
aircrew training. Training aids excluded from the guidance of this chapter include environmental
improvement projects, housekeeping equipment, and devices (such as flight scheduling boards,
command post briefing boards, award plaques, etc.) that do not have a direct application to
training programs. Training aids will be locally manufactured at the unit level, by Det 1, ACC
TRSS, or for videos, by 436 TS at Dyess AFB TX. ATA/ATDs are integral to formal operations
training courses of instruction and continuation training programs under the direction of the HQ
ACC/A3.
6.3. Responsibilities:
   6.3.1. The OPR for ACC ATA/ATD manufacturing is the requesting ACC TRSS
   Detachment in coordination with ACC TRSS, Det 1 and ACC TRSS.
   6.3.2. ACC TRSS is the overall OPDR for the manufacture of ACC ATA/ATDs and has
   approval authority for all ACC ATA/ATD requests. Based OTD recommendations, the
   OPDR will ensure devices are manufactured to meet specific needs within CAF training
   programs, designed to maximize training potential, and are cost effective. The OPDR will
   avoid duplication of effort or unnecessary expenditure of resources by coordinating all
   requests through the applicable OTD team associated with the weapon system the ATA/ATD
   will support.
   6.3.3. The primary manufacturer of ATA/ATDs in ACC is Det 1, ACC TRSS located at
   Luke AFB AZ. Their budget enables the production and maintenance of ATA/ATDs that
   may not be available or practical through other procurement channels or are otherwise cost
   prohibitive. Their customers include ACC, as well as other MAJCOMs. ACC will be
   reimbursed for all ATA/ATDs developed for other MAJCOMs.
   6.3.4. 436 TS Multimedia Facility. A full scale multimedia production facility that develops,
   directs, and produces multimedia products from graphic imagery to include video/DVD
   productions for the Air Force and ACC. Their budget makes possible cradle to grave
   production through scripting, shooting, narrating, editing, dubbing, and initial distribution to
   include life cycle updates for this medium.
       6.3.4.1. Video ATAs may include but are not limited to in-flight video productions,
       aircraft servicing or Red Flag type training videos.
 36                                                              ACCI36-2250 27 JUNE 2014


         6.3.4.2. MAJCOMs other than ACC requesting products are required to establish a fund
         cite that is non-refundable once production begins. For clarification, contact 436 TS.
      6.3.5. ACC TRSS Detachments serve as or provide SMEs for training systems associated
      with their mission design series. A knowledgeable and available SME is a vital requirement
      for successful and timely production of ATA/ATDs.
6.4. Training Aid Needs Assessment. Application of the ISD process for media selection will
identify areas where integrated activities require training aids. ATAs are designed primarily to
improve training, save resources and enhance safety.
      6.4.1. Improve Training. ATA/ATDs provide realism to make training more effective and
      efficient. They may be as simple as graphs or charts (called visual aids); however, in
      technical and flying training programs, training aids are generally three-dimensional and
      designed to provide hands-on interactive training in the operation of equipment aircrew
      personnel will use on the job.
      6.4.2. Save Resources. Aircrew training conducted with aircrew training aids reduces the
      number of sorties required and/or enhances the effectiveness of sorties.
      6.4.3. Enhance Safety. Safety factors improve when critical tasks, or those which require
      intense training, are first learned using an ATA/ATD.
6.5. Requesting Aircrew Training Aids. The requesting unit's project officer will request
manufacture, update, or modification of ATA/ATDs with ACC TRSS, Det 1. For 436 TS
produced video ATAs, requesting organization’s project officer will use DD Form 1995, Visual
Information Production Request and Report.
6.6. Approval of ATA/ATD Requests:
      6.6.1. Det 1, ACC TRSS is the approval authority for projects under $25,000. ACC TRSS
      CC must approve all other requests.
      6.6.2. Approval authorities will consider Det 1’s time, cost estimate and the
      recommendations of the OTD team to determine whether to correct the training deficiency by
      modifying an existing device or building a new device.
6.7. Maintenance of ATA/ATDs. Det 1, ACC TRSS provides both field-level and depot-level
maintenance for all Det 1, ACC TRSS built ATA/ATDs, as well as for many of those built by
other trainer fabrication organizations.
6.8. Movement of ATD/ATA. For disposition or relocation of ATD/ATA, contact the
ATD/ATA FAMs at ACC TRSS Det 1, ACC TRSS for guidance. ATD/ATA will typically be
shipped through servicing Traffic Management Offices using DD Form 1149, Requisition and
Invoice/Shipping Document.
6.9. Request for ATA/ATDs from Other Commands or Services. Requests will be made and
processed IAW this instruction. The requesting command or service is responsible for the cost of
all materials and labor.
ACCI36-2250 27 JUNE 2014                                                                   37

NOTES:

  1. ISD scheduled or completed within 5 months of assignment to TRSS. Attendance is
  mandatory for detachment assigned SMEs. Attendance is recommended for non TRSS-
  assigned SMEs. This requirement may be fulfilled by attending AETC's 3-week course at
  Sheppard or the abbreviated course offered by the 436th TS at Dyess AFB TX. Sheppard
  also offers this course by mobile training team (MTT).

  2. TRSS personnel are sent to the 5-day Class Instructor Course (CIC) offered by the 436th
  TS at Dyess AFB TX. The Basic Instructor Course (BIC) may be useful for those who will
  be conducting and evaluating actual academic platform instruction. BIC is a 4-week course
  at Sheppard AFB TX and can be used as an alternative to CIC.

  3. Phase I G/SME training is a self-paced CBT covering general aspects of performing
  G/SME duties. Phase II G/SME training is contract specific, lasts approximately 2 hours, and
  is conducted person-to-person by HQ ACC Contracting, either by teleconference or site visit.

  4. For non TRSS owned CAT/CWD contracts, SPO assigned G/SME personnel may attend
  alternative QA training. SPO is the responsible funding agency.

  3. TDF validates the request. Will/should the training                       closed
  be taught in the FTU? Does it fit into the scope,
  structure and responsibilities of ACC TRSS? Does
  TRSS have the expertise and capability to meet the           Traning
  requirements, specifications and required delivery          available
                                                              & meets               YES

  (ACC TRSS Dets 1 & 8; 436 TS, ACC TRSS),
  development detachments, and the customer to hone
  training requirements and build project specifications
  using ISD. At this time the TRSS Det initiates                     A
  DAVIS/DITIS action to define the potential program
  development.

  7. Once all parties agree on design, structure, media, output, etc.,
  the TRSS Det updates the DAVIS/DITIS record annotating
  development has begun (this establishes a design freeze), the
  appropriate developing agency is tasked and the agency begins
  the development cycle based on project priority.
                                                                               NO       Customer

  to build and evaluate the training product. Several versions of
  the program may be built to resolve emerging challenges.
  Depending on project complexity and resource availability, this
                                                                                                YES
  phase could take from 2 to 12 months. Available technology,
  SME support and manpower levels may positively or negatively
  impact the project timeline.

  9. Once the program is built by the development team and                          validates product
  acceptable to the customer, it is sent to ACC TRSS for command                           (10)
  validation, HQ ACC weapon system FAM for coordination, and
  HQ ACC/A3 for approval (see paragraph 6.3.5.1. and 6.3.5.2.).

  10. Approval authority has been delegated by HQ ACC/A3 to                             Obtain
  ACC TRSS/CC.                                                                        ACC/A3(X)

  11. ACC TRSS provides the approved training product and
  distribution guidelines to the distribution agency (may be the
  development agency or OTD team). The Detachments prepare
  the general release message and update DAVIS/DITIS on
  completion of development.
                                                                               NO       ACC/A3
  12. The distribution agency (either the developing agency or                          approves
  OTD team) distributes courseware to the field.                                        product?
  Should the program require modification after any length of time                        (11)
  or the Det/FTU no longer requires the product, contact the TRSS
  Det for DAVIS/DITIS update/removal.                                                           YES

Figure A6.2. CT Topic Selection Process.




Table A6.1. CT Topic Selection Process Steps.
Step 1: Wing or OG/CC or MAJCOM Staff submits training need. Include sent request to
various functional areas for action including the RTRB, Weapon and Tactics Review Board, and
TPT for inclusion into the STP.
Step 2: The applicable HQ ACC/A3 functional reviews and prioritizes the request. If endorsed
by the functional it is sent to Step 3A; if not, the request is returned to the originator with
rationale for rejecting the training request.
Step 3A: The Functional sends the topic to ACC TRSS. TRSS examines the request to ensure the
instructional need, instructional system concept, and resource requirements/constraints have been
addressed IAW AFMAM 36-2234 Chapter 3 and AFH 36-2235 Volume 6, Informational For
Designers of Instructional Systems Guide to Needs Assessment. Additionally, TRSS validates the
topic with the current DIMOC DoD master courseware topics list to ensure there is no
duplication of effort.
Step 3B: ACC TRSS returns package to functional for proposal to the HQ ACC/A3 for
developmental approval.
Step 4: HQ ACC/A3 determines appropriate course of action, based on the recommendation of
applicable A3 Division and ACC TRSS – the request is then placed in a development queue for
construction, entered into the DIMOC courseware database and updated as required throughout
the course of the project.

Table A8.1. Graduate Evaluation Process Steps.

Notes:
1. The graduate evaluation process begins following graduation of students from a formal
operations training course.
2. OTD Team develops the graduate/supervisor questionnaire.
3. OTD Team seeks AFPC Survey Support approval annually.
4. The OTD team sends out graduate evaluation surveys to formal training graduates and their
operational supervisors. The survey window is usually 3 to 6 months after graduating from the
formal training course, but earlier surveying is possible (see paragraph 3.3.1.1).
5. Graduates and supervisors complete surveys. The ACC goal for GEQ return rate is 80
percent.
6. The OTD team could gather graduate data via alternative methods (see paragraph 3.3.4).
7. The OTD team analyzes data obtained from surveys, and alternate methods, if applicable.
8. The OTD team should conduct field visits to operational units only if the analysis indicates
the need for further data. See paragraph 3.3.3, Attachment 13 and Attachment 14 for
guidance.
9. The OTD team prepares the GER following the example report format and guidance found in
Attachment 10, Attachment 11, and Attachment 12, and sends it to the ACC TRSS/TDF
Graduate Evaluation Program manager. The report is reviewed by the ACC TRSS/TDF Graduate
Evaluation Program manager and submitted to the ACC TRSS/CC. If the report does not follow
the format guidance, it will be sent back to the OTD team for correction and resubmission.
10. The ACC TRSS/CC sends the approved report to the HQ ACC syllabus OPR (weapon
system FAM) and to the OTD team.
11. Detachment makes subsequent distribution to all customers the syllabus supports, to include
the appropriate OG/CCs.
12. The graduate evaluation report is reviewed at the SRB along with other sources of feedback.
Pertinent data that could affect changes to the current formal training course curriculum is
identified.

                       GRADUATE EVALUATION QUESTIONNAIRES

A9.1. Graduate Evaluation Questionnaires. Graduate evaluation questionnaires solicit
information necessary to evaluate the training received at the training unit to ascertain whether
the student was trained to the appropriate level based on performance required at the operational
unit. Questionnaire variations are authorized; however, each questionnaire will include:
      A9.1.1. Graduate/supervisor information including name, course graduated from, class
      number and indication of student or supervisor questionnaire.
      A9.1.2. An explanation that the questionnaire is part of a continuous quality improvement
      process and results are taken seriously.
      A9.1.3. Instructions for return and response suspense.
      A9.1.4. Statement of non-attribution assuring the graduate that their name and class number
      are used only for tracking and comparison purposes and not to grade or take action against
      the graduate.
      A9.1.5. Graduate or supervisor data, including graduate's/supervisor's rating of task areas
      from syllabus (also called mission tasks, graded mission elements, etc.).
      A9.1.6. An explanation of the rating scale.
      A9.1.7. Questions developed using master task lists for rating the academics received during
      training.
      A9.1.8. Questions to solicit information on the value of any devices used in training.
      A9.1.9. Space to add written comments.

                                           Attachment 12
               GRADUATE EVALUATION REPORT WRITING GUIDELINES

A12.1. Graduate Evaluation Report Writing Guidelines. This attachment provides
guidelines that must be followed when writing all ACC formal operations training GERs.
      A12.1.1. Cover Letter. The GER cover letter will not be submitted on letterhead. The
      memorandum will be cut and pasted into an email. Use format at Attachment 10 and add
      appropriate information as required. Paragraph 1 should list all data sources. Do not include a
      colon after DSN in paragraph 3. After signature block list the attachment(s).
      A12.1.2. Grad Eval Report.
         A12.1.2.1. Letterhead. GERs will be submitted on OTD team organizational letterhead.
         Note: GERs will be marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" on the top and bottom of
         each page.
         A12.1.2.2. Data Tables. Verify survey data and represent the total number of survey
         responses. The number of responses for each line in the matrix should usually add up to
         the total number of respondents. Explain any instances where a respondent submitted
         comments without selecting a rating value or where a significant number selected “N/A”.
         A12.1.2.3. Percent Dissatisfaction Computation. Dissatisfaction is defined as a rating of
         inadequately prepared (0) and significantly exceeded (4). Compute the percent
         dissatisfied by summing the number of “0” and “4” responses and divide by the total
         number of responses (excluding “NA” responses). Express the percentage to the nearest
         whole percent.
         A12.1.2.4. Pertinent Data Analysis. Pertinent data falls into two categories: ratings and
         written comments. When the percent dissatisfaction column is 10 percent or larger, the
         ratings are pertinent and must be reported in this section. When 10 percent of the
         respondents written comments indicate a concern, the comments are pertinent and must
         be reported in this section. Any comment may be deemed pertinent based on OTD team
         subjective evaluation and may be included in this section. The corrective action should be
         well thought out and listed in explicit detail. If no corrective action is necessary, list
         "NONE."
             A12.1.2.4.1. Graduate Pertinent Data Analysis. Summarize all pertinent findings for
             each training category (e.g., academic, device and flying training). If there are no
             pertinent findings for a category, list the training category and "None."
             A12.1.2.4.2. Supervisor Pertinent Data Analysis. Summarize all pertinent findings.
             If there are no pertinent findings, indicate "None" in this paragraph.
      A12.1.3. General Writing Guidelines.
         A12.1.3.1. Font Style/Size. Use Times New Roman 11- or 12-point font for all reports.
         Font size must be consistent throughout document. Exception: Font size/style may differ
         in tables and figures to save space or fit an entire table/figure on one page, but
         tables/figures must be consistent within the document.
ACCI36-2250 27 JUNE 2014                                                                   65


     A12.1.3.2. Use of Bold Type. Use bold type to highlight section, table and chart
     headings. See Attachment 11.
     A12.1.3.3. Line Spacing. Lines should be single-spaced and justified.
  A12.1.3.4. . Signature Block. Always verify with ACC TRSS/TDF that you are using the
  correct signature blocks on GERs.
  A12.1.4. Proofreading. To improve GER quality, one or two individuals without technical
  expertise in the particular weapon system or syllabus topic should review the report. We
  strongly recommend a word-for-word review to catch errors that may be overlooked due to
  familiarity with the weapon system or training topic. Maintain a consistent writing style
  throughout the entire document and follow AFH 33-337, The Tongue and Quill, for
  grammatical guidance.
  A12.1.5. Use Spell Check. Use to check spelling, grammar, punctuation and spacing.
  However, just using spell check is no substitute for a quality word-for-word review.
  A12.1.6. Be Consistent. Be consistent throughout the document when grammatical
  guidelines are not defined or there is more than one correct method.
  A12.1.7. Acronyms.
     A12.1.7.1. Spell out all acronyms when first used.
     A12.1.7.2. Do not capitalize words within the context of a sentence just because the
     acronym is capitalized (e.g., Attached is the graduate evaluation report (GER) for the…).
  A12.1.8. Capitalization/Word Use Guidelines.
     A12.1.8.1. Reference The Tongue and Quill for rules on capitalization.
     A12.1.8.2. Do not break organizational references (e.g., 55 OG/CC) onto separate lines.
     A12.1.8.3. Spell out numbers less than 10 unless used to designate a unit of measure or
     time.
     A12.1.8.4. Follow the guidelines in the Tongue and Quill for proper use of commas. Use
     should be consistent throughout document.
