This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 48-1, Aerospace Medicine
Enterprise, and references Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 48-151, Thermal Injury. This
instruction covers the dissemination of required information and training for Air Force
employees. The intent of this instruction is to reduce the incidence of thermal injury by
informing employees of the hazards associated with, and proper preventive measure to be taken,
when training in extreme temperatures. This instruction applies to all United States Air Force
Academy (USAFA) personnel. This publication does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC) units or the Air National Guard (ANG). Governing directives for the heat stress
program implemented by this instruction are AFPAM 48-151, Thermal Injury. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication. Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records,
and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System
(AFRIMS)          Records        Disposition        Schedule        (RDS)          located       at

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Updated the 306 OSS webpage address. Removed Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE)
responsibility to measure Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) separate from 306 OSS WBGT
measurements during Basic Cadet Training (BCT) and Preparatory School basic training. Added
 2                                                               USAFAI48-151 18 JULY 2012


BE responsibility to monitor Frostbite Risk Level (FRL) and wind chill tables (Attachment 3).
Added Command Post responsibility to relay thermal injury information as needed.
1. Scope of Instruction: All personnel associated with conducting and surveillance of all
strenuous activities to include Basic Cadet Training (BCT), Preparatory school training,
Commandant Challenge, Recognition ceremonies, emergency response, and decontamination
operations.
2. Roles and Responsibilities:
     2.1. Commanders: Commanders will establish lesson plans and procedures for conducting
     training to ensure personnel are protected in hot and cold environments, in accordance with
     AFPAM 48-151 and this instruction. Written procedures may be in the form of workplace
     specific training materials, operating instructions, or equivalent formats. Commanders will
     ensure plans contain the procedures for training in hot and/or cold environments including
     identification of high-risk activities and course of action based on reported flag conditions.
     Procurement of flags and establishing a reporting system is a unit responsibility. Units will
     also be responsible for procurement of proper Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) for
     assigned personnel.
     2.2. Contract Weather Team (306 OSS/OSW): The 306 OSS/OSW is USAFA's primary
     source for WBGT and wind chill information. Current USAFA temperature, wind chill,
     wind speed, and WBGT data are available at http://hwas.usafa.edu/. Contact the 306
     OSS/OSW (DSN 333-2058) for assistance in determining which sensor is the most
     representative of your location. The 25th Operational Weather Squadron, Davis-Monthan
     AFB, AZ can be contacted after 306 OSS/OSW duty hours at (DSN 228-6673). Additional
     information on 306 OSS/OSW operational weather support is available in 306 FTG
     Instruction 15-101, USAF Academy Weather Support.
     2.3. 10th Aerospace Medicine Squadron, Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight
     (10 AMDS/SGPB): Oversees the overall heat and/or cold stress program outlined in
     AFPAM 48-151 and supplements the 306 OSS/OSW WBGT readings with additional
     readings when requested.
        2.3.1. BE is responsible for measuring the WBGT index to supplement 306 OSS
        measurements upon request. Requests for additional WBGT support must be received by
        BE at least 14 days prior to the event.
            2.3.1.1. Monitoring will cease when BE determines the health risk is low, usually
            when the outdoor temperature drops below 85º F and the WBGT index drops below
            82º F; when the weather becomes inclement (heavy rain, high winds, etc.); or at the
            end of the training day. When hot weather conditions return, monitoring will resume.
            2.3.1.2. BE will notify the USAFA Command Post and Cadet command section of
            WBGT readings and recommendations so proper training conditions can be
            announced.
        2.3.2. The reported flag condition will be based on heat categories established in Table
        A2.1. and Table A2.2. of Attachment 2. The procedures outlined in Table A2.1. and
        Table A2.2. of Attachment 2 contain the BE recommended work and/or rest cycles and
USAFAI48-151 18 JULY 2012                                                                       3


       preventative guidance for the various WBGT stages based on acclimatized and un-
       acclimatized trainees.
       2.3.3. In the event of an emergency response requiring sustained Level A and/or
       decontamination operations, BE will monitor WBGT conditions (adding 10F to the
       WBGT due to response PPE) and provide the on-scene commander with health risk
       advice. Search and Recovery activities and Emergency Support teams will be monitored
       when conditions meet the requirement in Paragraph 2.3.1.1.
       2.3.4. BE may train personnel conducting cadet wing and/or prep school training
       operations to perform the WBGT with BE oversight. Training must be conducted and
       documented annually. Equipment will be loaned out by BE and reacquired at the end of
       the training operation. Alternatively, cadet and/or prep school units may purchase
       WBGT equipment with prior BE approval.
       2.3.5. BE will obtain outside ground temperature and wind speed from the 306
       OSS/OSW and determine the Wind Chill Temperature and Frostbite Risk Level (FRL)
       using AFPAM 48-151. BE will notify the installation command post of the resulting
       FRL and recommendations.
   2.4. 10th Aerospace Medicine Squadron, Public Health (10 AMDS/SGPM): Public
   Health will investigate and appropriately report health related illnesses.
   2.5. Occupational and Environmental Health Working Group (OEHWG): When
   requested, the OHWG will collaborate with commanders and supervisors to ensure the
   success of the program. Tasks include evaluation of hot and/or cold training environments,
   educating clinical providers on their roles and responsibilities, educating and advising
   commanders and supervisors on implementation of prevention techniques, collecting and
   analyzing heat illness data, and using the data to help reduce future heat illness rates.
       2.5.1. The OEHWG will review unit training lesson plans and provide medical advice on
       training activity restrictions during their workplace review or upon request by training
       commanders.
   2.6. Command Post (10 ABW/CP): The command post shall relay WBGT and FRL
   information and recommendations using the base communication networks as needed.
   2.7. Workplace Supervisors:
       2.7.1. Will obtain WBGT, wind chill and weather information from 306 OSS IAW
       paragraph 2.2. during hot and cold weather conditions.
       2.7.2. Shall implement personnel protective measures as listed in AFPAM 48-151 and
       consider implementing additional BE recommendations when notified by Command Post.
3. Water Intake: Water intake levels should coincide with BE recommendations in accordance
with Attachment 2, Tables A2.1. and A2.2., WBGT Stages, Temperature Ranges, and Flag
Colors.
4. Prevention Measures: The key to prevention of thermal illness and/or injury is an
awareness of thermal risk factors by commanders, supervisors, and individuals at all levels. Any
training or task involving physical exertion in a hot or cold climate should be considered a high-
risk activity. Risk of illness and/or injury is based primarily upon environmental conditions,

work rate, and clothing worn. When there is a thermal casualty risk, it is the commander’s duty
to ensure that resources are available to undertake an appropriate risk assessment and employ
risk management actions. Attachment 4 provides Heat-Stress information for all to review, and
health recommendations for commanders to consider and/or implement.

     personnel should not exceed 1½ quarts. Rapid ingestion of water, if greater than 1½ quarts per hour,
     may lead to hyponatremia, also known as acute water intoxication. This is a life-threatening
     condition that may lead to weakness, loss of consciousness, convulsions, and death if not recognized
