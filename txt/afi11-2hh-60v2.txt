   their MAJCOM OPR for pre-publication review.
1.5. Roles and Responsibilities.
   1.5.1. Headquarters, Air Combat Command (ACC).
       1.5.1.1. ACC Director of Air and Space Operations (A3) is designated as the responsible
       agency for this volume IAW AFPD 11-2, Aircrew Operations, and will process all
       change requests.
       1.5.1.2. Provide applicable guidance and oversight IAW AFI 11-202V2.
   1.5.2. MAJCOMs, NAFs, Wings/Groups. Provide applicable guidance and oversight IAW
   AFI 11-202V2. (T-2).
1.6. Evaluation Procedures. (T-2).
   1.6.1. Flight Examiners (FEs) will use the evaluation criteria contained in each crew position
   chapter for conducting all flight and emergency procedures evaluations (EPEs).
   1.6.2. Prior to the aircrew briefings, the FE will brief the examinee on specific evaluation
   areas, purpose and conduct of the evaluation, and, if applicable, will inform the Aircraft
   Commander of special requirements. The examinee will accomplish appropriate flight
 6                                                       AFI11-2HH-60V2 20 OCTOBER 2014


     planning/mission preparation. FEs will be furnished copies of mission materials to include
     necessary maps, flight logs, etc.
     1.6.3. Unless specified, the examinee or FE may fly in any seat (within their crew
     qualification), to include the cabin, that will best enable the FE to conduct a thorough
     evaluation. Exception: Student pilot evaluations will have either a qualified instructor pilot
     or flight examiner at a set of controls.
     1.6.4. Units may use the AF Form 4038, HH-60 Evaluation Worksheet, to aid in
     administering flight evaluations and EPEs.
     1.6.5. During an actual emergency, the FE will determine when to terminate an evaluation.
     1.6.6. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the evaluation. This debrief will include
     the overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified), and
     required additional training (if applicable).
1.7. Grading Systems. (T-2).
     1.7.1. Grading instructions and performance criteria are contained in AFI 11-202V2 and
     crew position chapters in this instruction.
     1.7.2. Critical grading areas have been established for all flight evaluations IAW AFI 11-
     202V2. Critical areas are defined as those core areas, which if not performed to the
     “Qualified” level, could result in loss of life or damage to equipment.
     1.7.3. Boldface     procedures,     crew/flight    discipline,    situational    awareness,
     safety/judgment/airmanship are considered critical. If one of these areas is graded U, then
     the overall grade for the evaluation will be Q-3. Note: boldface is required for all crew
     positions.
     1.7.4. Areas not applicable to the unit or mission need not be performed; however, all areas
     performed will be graded.
     1.7.5. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances, provided the examinee applies
     prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying safety. The FE will
     consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade. However, a grade of Q-3
     shall not be given based on unsubstantiated FE opinion.
     1.7.6. When grading criteria specifies that airspeed be evaluated and the flight manual lists
     only a minimum/maximum/recommended airspeed for that area, the examinee will brief the
     desired airspeed.
     1.7.7. The FE will compare examinee performance for each required area accomplished
     during the evaluation with the evaluation criteria provided in each crew position chapter and
     assign an appropriate grade. Derive the overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades
     based on observed events and tasks IAW this publication.
     1.7.8. FEs will use the grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area grades.
     FE judgment must be exercised when the wording of areas is subjective and when specific
     situations are not covered. FE judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the
     overall grade.
1.8. Ground Phase Requisites. (T-2).

     1.8.7. Boldface Exam. IAW AFI 11-202V2 and MAJCOM Supplements.
1.9. Evaluations. (T-2). Conduct flight evaluations IAW AFI 11-202V2, MAJCOM/Local
supplements, and guidance contained in this instruction.
     1.9.1. General.
        1.9.1.1. Evaluations administered during exercises or non-contingency deployments are
        encouraged. Evaluations administered to maintain mission qualification status during
        contingency/combat deployments will be given a last resort.
        1.9.1.2. Examinees will be evaluated in the position of their highest qualification. If
        briefed, and at the FEs discretion, portions may be flown in another position, but the
        emphasis is to have examinees evaluated at their highest qualification level.
     1.9.2. Mission Evaluations. MSN evaluation profiles/scenarios will be based on unit
     Designed Operational Capability (DOC) taskings. Evaluation profiles will be designed to
     evaluate the training/flight position/special qualifications as well as basic airmanship of the
     examinee and will normally be flown using unit formations and tactics.
        1.9.2.1. Initial (INIT) and Requalification (REQUAL) MSN evaluations will be
        accomplished at night utilizing NVGs.
        1.9.2.2. Periodic MSN evaluations will be accomplished at night utilizing NVGs.
        Exception: SQ/CC may approve a current and qualified aircrew member to accomplish a
        Periodic MSN evaluation during the day. The subsequent MSN evaluation will be
        conducted at night and the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Certification, will be
        documented to capture reasons for the deviation in the additional comments of the
        examiner’s remarks section.
        1.9.2.3. Formation will be evaluated on all INIT, REQUAL, and periodic evaluations.
        Exception: SQ/CC may approve a deviation for periodic evaluations only. The
        subsequent evaluation will include formation and the AF Form 8 will be documented to
        capture reasons for the deviation in the additional comments of the examiner’s remarks
        section.
AFI11-2HH-60V2 20 OCTOBER 2014                                                               9


       1.9.2.4. All aircrew will complete a MSN (QUAL/MSN for MG) evaluation prior to
       being designated as Basic Mission Capable (BMC) or Combat Mission Ready (CMR).
       1.9.2.5. Helicopter Air-to-Air Refueling (HAAR) will be evaluated on all INIT and
       REQUAL MSN evaluations. ARC only: Note 2 of Tables 3.1 and Table 4.1 apply.
       1.9.2.6. Gunnery will be evaluated on all INIT, REQUAL, and periodic evaluations.
       Blank ammunition may be used to satisfy periodic evaluation requirements.
       1.9.2.7. For CMR aircrew to complete an evaluation, all areas in the crew position event
       tables (Table 2.1, Table 3.1, and Table 4.1), annotated with an “R” must be
       accomplished. BMC aircrew will only be evaluated on those missions routinely
       performed and in those areas which they are qualified to perform unsupervised. Only
       those areas in which the examinee is qualified/certified may be evaluated.
   1.9.3. Formal Course Evaluations. (T-2).
       1.9.3.1. Conduct evaluations IAW syllabus mission profile guidelines, or on a mission
       profile developed from syllabus training objectives. Formal course guidelines may be
       modified based on local operating considerations or FE judgment. Grading will be IAW
       performance criteria established in this instruction. Pilot and copilot INIT or REQUAL
       evaluations will have a qualified instructor or FE in a seat with a set of controls.
       1.9.3.2. If required, HAAR and gunnery operations may be evaluated in conjunction with
       the last formal training unit (FTU) training flight. The unit commander or operations
       officer must pre-approve this method. The FE will make it clear to the student when the
       training period ends and when the evaluation begins. These evaluations will be
       documented on the same AF Form 8 as the INIT MSN evaluation.
1.10. Instructor Evaluation. (T-2). Instructor evaluations do not have requisites and will be
conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2, Table 2.1, Table 3.1, and Table 4.1 of this AFI, and the
following:
   1.10.1. REQUAL Instructor evaluations may be combined with REQUAL QUAL, MSN, or
   QUAL/MSN evaluations.
   1.10.2. SQ/CC approval is required to conduct an INIT INSTR evaluation with a periodic
   evaluation.
   1.10.3. Units may request that periodic evaluations be accomplished at the FTU after an
   instructor upgrade training course is complete. The periodic evaluation may be accomplished
   provided a cross-command evaluation request is submitted and approved prior to the
   evaluation. Route requests through OGV to MAJCOM A3V/A3TV for coordination with
   AETC/A3V/A3Z. INIT INSTR evaluations at the FTU must be successfully completed prior
   to administering the periodic evaluation.
   1.10.4. Instructor candidates must be current and qualified on events which they will be
   evaluated during the INIT/INSTR evaluation.
   1.10.5. Instructor candidates will be evaluated on instructor performance at a minimum on
   areas/sub-areas listed in Table 2.1, Table 3.1, and Table 4.1 of this AFI.
   1.10.6. SQ/CCs may designate and qualify instructors as instrument and/or basic qualified
   only.

1.11. Flight Examiners.
   1.11.1. Evaluators must be current in a given event prior to acting as an evaluator in the
   event. (T-2).
   1.11.2. Evaluators who subsequently add other certifications are automatically certified to
   evaluate these new certification events.
1.12. Alternate Evaluation of Sub-Areas. (T-2).
   1.12.1. For initial and requalification evaluations, all required items must be performed by
   actual demonstration.
   1.12.2. For periodic evaluations, when it is impossible or impractical to evaluate a required
   area in flight, the FE may elect to evaluate the area(s) by an alternate method (simulator,
   procedural trainer, or verbal examination). Document why required area(s) were not
   evaluated in flight and the alternate method of evaluation used in the additional comments
   paragraph of the examiner’s remarks section of the AF Form 8. If, in the FE’s judgment, a
   required item cannot be adequately evaluated, complete the evaluation on an additional
   flight.
   1.12.3. The unit Chief of Stan/Eval, FE, or SQ/CC will decide if the evaluation is complete.
1.13. Evaluation Documentation. (T-2). AF Form 8 documentation will be IAW AFI 11-
202V2, MAJCOM/Local supplements and the following:
   1.13.1. For qualification and evaluation purposes Special Mission Aviation (SMA)
   crewmembers (AFSC 1A9XX), crew designations are as follows: FF/MF/IF/EF for Fully
   Qualified Special Mission Aviators (FQSMA) (legacy Flight Engineers) and MG/IG/EG for
   Partially Qualified Special Mission Aviators (PQSMA) (legacy Aerial Gunners).
      1.13.1.1. PQSMAs (MG) become FQSMAs (MF) upon completion of training that
      results in INIT QUAL and INIT MSN evaluations. MG crew members who complete the
      FF INIT QUAL evaluation will be designated as “HH-60/FF” on the AF Form 8. MG
      crew members who complete the MF INIT MSN evaluation will be designated as “HH-
      60/MF” on the AF Form 8.
      1.13.1.2. IG qualification and EG certification will not transfer with MF qualification
      and will be maintained as follows:
          1.13.1.2.1. MF crew members with a current HH-60/IG AF Form 8 will continue to
          receive IG evaluations until upgraded to IF. The MF and IG evaluations may be
          documented on a single AF Form 8 provided the evaluations are combined or occur
          within a timeframe that meets AF Form 8 completion requirements of AFI 11-202V2
          and MAJCOM supplements. Note: This guidance only applies to IG evaluations
          conducted with MF MSN evaluations.
          1.13.1.2.2. If the combined method is used, document the AF Form 8 as follows: list
          both crew positions in the ACFT/CREW POSITION block: “HH-60 IG/MF”.
          Document the ELIGIBILITY PERIOD block utilizing two lines: “QUAL/MSN (IG)
          and MSN (MF)”, and list the associated period for each evaluation IAW AFI 11-
          202V2 and MAJCOM supplements. List both evaluations in the MISSION/CHECK
AFI11-2HH-60V2 20 OCTOBER 2014                                                              11


         block of the AF Form 8: “QUAL/MSN (IG) and MSN (MF)”. Use prefixes IAW AFI
         11-202V2 and MAJCOM supplements.
  1.13.2. HH-60 AF Form 8 mission descriptions will be of sufficient content to verify that the
  required areas for the evaluation were completed. The examples below are provided as a
  guide and are not all inclusive.
     1.13.2.1. QUAL evaluation example: This INSTM/QUAL evaluation was performed in
     the XXX local VFR and IFR patterns at XXX. Sortie consisted of normal transition
     maneuvers and simulated emergency procedures to include XXX and autorotations.
     Examinee performed a precision ILS approach to XXX followed by a non-precision
     XXX approach to XXX. Instructional abilities were demonstrated through all phases of
     flight to include XXX. The examinee performed all required maneuvers in a XXX
     manner IAW AFI 11-2HH-60V2 Table XX. The XX RQS/CC was debriefed on the
     results of this evaluation.
     1.13.2.2. MSN evaluation example: This MSN evaluation was performed in the XXX
     area, XXX gun range, and XXX HAAR track. Sortie consisted of NVG low-level, NVG
     formation, evasive maneuvers that consisted of (MIF,AAA, radar threat), and terminal
     area operations with the following AIEs: hoist, rope ladder, fast rope, rappel.
     Instructional abilities were demonstrated through all phases of flight to include XXX.
     The examinee performed all required maneuvers in a XXX manner IAW AFI 11-2HH-
     60V2, Table XX. The XX RQS/CC was debriefed on the results of this evaluation. Note:
     SMA Mission descriptions will include the weapon system evaluated.

                                    PILOT EVALUATIONS

2.1. Crew Positions. (T-2). Evaluation standards will be administered in accordance with the
individual’s crew position as listed below:
   2.1.1. Mission Pilot (MP). Pilots that have completed both the Instrument/Qualification
   (INSTM/QUAL) and Mission (MSN) requirements of Chapter 2. MPs will be evaluated in
   all required areas unless indicated otherwise. MPs will be evaluated using (P) criteria in all
   areas of Table 2.1
   2.1.2. Mission Copilot (MC). Pilots that have completed both the INSTM/QUAL and MSN
   requirements of Table 2.1. Copilots will be evaluated to the same sub-area criteria as mission
   pilots unless indicated otherwise. MCs will be evaluated using copilot criteria in sub-areas
   noted with (MC) in Chapter 2.
   2.1.3. First Pilot (FP). Pilots that have only completed the Instrument/Qualification
   (INSTM/QUAL) requirements and/or only the MC MSN requirements of Table 2.1. With
   few exceptions, this position is not intended to be used as a permanent qualification.
   2.1.4. Instructor Pilots (IP):
       2.1.4.1. IPs will be evaluated IAW para 1.10
       2.1.4.2. IPs will be evaluated to instructor sub-area criteria in Table 2.1 and para 2.1.1
   2.1.5. Evaluator Pilot (EP) objectivity evaluations will be IAW AFI 11-202V2 and
   MAJCOM supplements.
2.2. Evaluation Event Requirements. (T-2). Refer to Table 2.1 for required events.
   2.2.1. Instrument/Qualification Evaluations. INSTM evaluations are normally conducted
   concurrently with QUAL evaluations IAW instrument flight rules. QUAL profiles require
   demonstrated proficiency in transition maneuvers and in-flight emergency procedures. Note:
   The INSTM portion of the INSTM/QUAL evaluation may be administered in a MAJCOM-
   approved H-60 flight simulator.
   2.2.2. Pilot Mission Evaluations. Administer evaluations based on examinee’s
   qualification and experience level as well as certifications listed in AFI 11-2HH-60V1, HH-
   60 Aircrew Training.
   2.2.3. Instructor Pilot Evaluations.
       2.2.3.1. To ensure maximum training effectiveness between instructor examinee and
       student, the FE should administer INIT INSTR evaluations from the cabin provided a
       qualified instructor is at a set of controls and acting as the “student”. Evaluations are
       administered from the most appropriate position based on FE discretion.
       2.2.3.2. Instructor candidates will accomplish an INIT INSTR INSTM/QUAL and an
       INIT INSTR MSN evaluation. Events certified after the initial instructor evaluation do
       not require additional instructor evaluations. Exception: Night Water Operations
       certification will not carry over when a pilot becomes instructor qualified. Certification as
       a Night Water Instructor Pilot is required IAW AFI 11-2HH-60V1.

annotated on AF Form 8.
Note 3. Required on INIT and RQ
evaluations.
2.4. Pilot Flight Evaluation Criteria. (T-2).
   2.4.1. General. This section contains evaluation criteria for conducting HH-60 pilot flight
   evaluations. This criterion serves as a grading guide for evaluators. If a crew position is
   listed, then that criterion is applicable only to that crew position. The absence of a crew
   position indicates that the criterion is applicable to all crew positions.
   2.4.2. Evaluation Objectives:
       2.4.2.1. Initial, Requalification, and Periodic QUAL Evaluations. The examinee
       must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to operate the aircraft and aircraft related
       systems safely and effectively IAW the appropriate flight manual and other operating
       procedures. Pilots must also demonstrate the ability to operate the aircraft under
       instrument flight conditions IAW applicable procedures.
       2.4.2.2. Initial, Requalification, and Periodic MSN Evaluations. The examinee must
       satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform the mission and operate the aircraft and
       aircraft related systems safely and effectively. Mission sub-areas of Table 2.1 require a
       reasonable level of simulated threats and intelligence inputs.

      FULLY QUALIFIED SPECIAL MISSION AVIATOR (MF) EVALUATIONS

3.1. Crew Positions. (T-2). Evaluation standards will be administered in accordance with the
individual’s crew position as listed below: Reference Chapter 4 for requirements of MGs that
are transitioning to the MF position.
   3.1.1. Basic Qualified SMA (FF). SMAs that have only completed the qualification
   (QUAL) requirements of Table 3.1 Normally, this position is not intended to be used as a
   permanent qualification.
   3.1.2. Fully Qualified SMA (MF). SMAs that have completed both the Qualification
   (QUAL) and Mission (MSN) requirements of Table 3.1 MFs will be evaluated in all required
   areas unless indicated otherwise.
   3.1.3. Fully Qualified Instructor SMA (IF). SMAs that have completed the Initial
   Instructor requirements of Table 3.1
3.2. Evaluation Event Requirements. (T-2). Refer to Table 3.1 for required events.
   3.2.1. Initial/Periodic Qualification Evaluations. Qualification profiles require
   demonstrated proficiency in contact maneuvers and in-flight emergency procedures listed in
   Table 3.1 Evaluations may be accomplished with the examinee on the left or right side of the
   aircraft.
   3.2.2. Initial/Periodic Mission Evaluations. Mission evaluations may be conducted
   concurrently with QUAL evaluations as long as the required items in Table 3.1 are
   completed. Evaluations may be accomplished with the examinee on the left or right side of
   the aircraft. Note: Evaluatees will receive the INIT MSN (MF) evaluation from the right side
   of the aircraft.
   3.2.3. Initial/Periodic Instructor Evaluations.
       3.2.3.1. Instructor flight evaluations should be conducted on instructional missions with
       a student. When students are not available or mission/crew composition requirements
       prevent the inclusion of students, another qualified crewmember or the evaluator will
       serve as the “student” (e.g., an SMA currently in training, a qualified SMA, or the
       evaluator). The “student” will perform those duties prescribed by the instructor/evaluator
       for the mission being accomplished. The instructor candidate will monitor all phases of
       flight from an advantageous position and be prepared to demonstrate or explain any area
       or procedure.
       3.2.3.2. Events certified after the initial instructor evaluation do not require additional
       instructor certification.
   3.2.4. Alternate Insertion and Extraction (AIE) and Gunnery. Any current and qualified
   evaluator SMA (EG/EF) may evaluate “like items” such as AIEs and gunnery. Hoists will
   only be evaluated by an EF. See AFI 11-2HH-60V1 for a list of like items.

      3.2.4.1. Once trained and evaluated on one gun system (M-240, GAU-18/GAU-21, or
      GAU-2), training and certification on additional systems will be in accordance with AFI
      11-2HH-60V1.
      3.2.4.2. During periodic evaluations, SMAs may be evaluated on any gun system in
      which they are qualified. If possible, do not evaluate the same gun system on two
      consecutive evaluation cycles. The system not evaluated by actual demonstration will be
      evaluated verbally.
      3.2.4.3. AIE/Hoist Evaluation Requirements. Live AIEs are required for INIT MSN
      evaluations. Live AIEs are encouraged, but are not required, for requalification or
      periodic evaluations. AIE and hoist operations will be evaluated using actual equipment
      for each event. Note: Failure to complete live AIE requirements will be documented on
      the AF Form 8 IAW AFI 11-202V2. The restriction may be lifted upon certification IAW
      AFI 11-2HH-60V1.
         3.2.4.3.1. INIT/RQ evals. Accomplish one of each event: fast rope, rappel, rope
         ladder, and a hoist insertion or extraction.
         3.2.4.3.2. Periodic evals. Accomplish one hoist insertion or extraction and one
         additional AIE.
         3.2.4.3.3. MG-qualified SMAs are only required to complete a live hoist during the
         MF INIT MSN evaluation. MG-qualified SMAs are considered live certified in other
         AIE operations.

   PARTIALLY QUALIFIED SPECIAL MISSION AVIATOR (MG) EVALUATIONS

4.1. Crew Positions. (T-2). Evaluation standards will be administered in accordance with the
individual’s crew position as listed below:
   4.1.1. Partially Qualified SMAs (MG). SMAs that have completed the
   Qualification/Mission (QUAL/MSN) requirements of Table 4.1 MGs will be evaluated in all
   required areas unless indicated otherwise.
       4.1.1.1. MG crew members that complete both the FF INIT QUAL and MF INIT MSN
       evaluations are considered Fully Qualified SMAs and will be evaluated using MF
       evaluation criteria in Chapter 3 for subsequent periodic evaluations.
       4.1.1.2. Crew members that have only completed the FF INIT QUAL evaluation will
       continue to receive a MG QUAL/MSN evaluation until completion of the MF INIT MSN
       evaluation.
   4.1.2. Partially Qualified Instructor SMA (IG): SMAs that have completed the Initial
   Instructor requirements of Table 4.1 Note: IG or EG crew members that complete an FF
   QUAL and/or MF MSN evaluation will not lose IG qualification or EG certification. These
   individuals will continue to receive an IG evaluation in addition to any FF or MF evaluation
   requirements until upgraded to IF. Reference para 1.13 for documentation requirements.
4.2. Evaluation Event Requirements. (T-2). Refer to Table 4.1 for required events.
   4.2.1. Initial/Periodic Qualification/Mission Evaluations. MGs receive a combined
   QUAL/MSN evaluation that includes items from the general, qualification, and mission
   phases of flight. Evaluations may be accomplished with the examinee on the left or right
   side of the aircraft.
   4.2.2. Initial/Periodic Instructor Evaluations.
       4.2.2.1. Instructor flight evaluations should be conducted on instructional missions with
       a student. When students are not available or mission/crew composition requirements
       prevent the inclusion of students, another qualified crewmember or the evaluator will
       serve as the “student” (e.g., an SMA currently in training, a qualified SMA, or the
       evaluator). The “student” will perform those duties prescribed by the instructor/evaluator
       for the mission being accomplished. The instructor candidate will monitor all phases of
       flight from an advantageous position and be prepared to demonstrate or explain any area
       or procedure.
       4.2.2.2. Events certified after the initial instructor evaluation do not require additional
       instructor evaluation.
   4.2.3. Alternate Insertion and Extraction (AIE) and Gunnery. Any current and qualified
   SMA evaluator may evaluate MGs on “like items” such as AIEs and gunnery. See AFI 11-
   2HH-60V1 for a list of like items.
       4.2.3.1. Once trained and evaluated on one weapon system (M-240, GAU-18/GAU-21,
       or GAU-2), training and certification on additional systems will be in accordance with
 52                                                   AFI11-2HH-60V2 20 OCTOBER 2014


      AFI 11-2HH-60V1. Note: Hoist-certified MGs will not be evaluated on hoist operations
      during QUAL/MSN evaluations.
      4.2.3.2. During periodic evaluations, SMAs may be evaluated on any gun system in
      which they are qualified. If possible, do not evaluate the same gun system on two
      consecutive evaluation cycles. The system not evaluated by actual demonstration will be
      evaluated verbally.
      4.2.3.3. AIE Evaluation Requirements. Live AIEs are required for INIT QUAL/MSN
      evaluations. Live AIEs are encouraged, but are not required for requalification or periodic
      evaluations. AIEs will be evaluated using actual equipment for each event. Note: Failure
      to complete live AIE requirements will be documented on the AF Form 8 IAW AFI 11-
      202V2. The restriction may be lifted upon certification IAW AFI 11-2HH-60V1.
         4.2.3.3.1. INIT/RQ evals. Accomplish one of each event: fast rope, rappel, and rope
         ladder.
         4.2.3.3.2. Periodic evals. Accomplish one AIE insertion and one AIE extraction.
4.3. Partially Qualified SMA (MG) Evaluated Event Requirement Table. (T-2). MG and
IG evaluation requirements are listed in Table 4.1
