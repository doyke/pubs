                                                Chapter 1

                                            INTRODUCTION

1.1. The System Safety Program.
    1.1.1. System safety programs, established throughout the Department of Defense (DOD), incorpo-
    rate safety into equipment, systems, facilities, operations, and training. The system safety program
    eliminates or controls hazards by design features, safety and warning devices, or special procedures
    and training. Special system safety personnel assigned to contractor and government program offices:
       1.1.1.1. Identify actual or potential hazards, usually done by detailed analysis of the systems in
       question.
       1.1.1.2. Assess hazards in terms of severity and likelihood. What is the worst that can happen, and
       how often might it happen?
       1.1.1.3. Determine corrective action. Eliminate by design or control with safety devices, warning
       devices, or special procedures and training?
       1.1.1.4. Follow-up to ensure corrective action is accomplished.
    1.1.2. AFI 91-202 and AFMC Sup 1 provide the requirements for implementing system safety pro-
    grams. Apply MIL-STD-882 fundamentals to SSG activities whenever possible.
    1.1.3. The latest version of DOD 5000 series ties the environment, safety, and occupational health
    (ESOH) efforts together. Accordingly, a program might wish to establish an ESOH working group
    instead of an SSG.

1.2. System Safety Group (SSG) Description. AFI 91-202 and AFI 91-202_AFMCS require that an
SSG be established for each major weapon system to include all aircraft. The SSG includes safety experts
associated with the particular weapon system. The SSG augments the local system safety function; it is
not a substitute or replacement. Therefore, many SSG members are personnel not assigned to the Program
Office within the Wing, Group, or Squadron, but they advise the system program manager or single man-
ager on safety matters. They act as an integrated product team (IPT) for system safety. The members assist
the program office in identifying risks, assessing these risks, and recommending solutions to these risks.
Solutions can be redesign, addition of safety or warning devices, revising training or operating proce-
dures, or accepting the risk without further actions.

1.3. SSG Functions. The SSG is an advisory group to the System Program Manager (SPM) or Single
Manager (SSM). Primarily, the SSG identifies/evaluates hazards, recommends corrective actions to
resolve the hazards, and assists in prioritizing hazards to effectively manage safety risk. In order to do
this, the SSG has many functions which include:
    1.3.1. Validate existing system safety criteria. Are current safety design criteria adequate? Is the sys-
    tem safety program adequate? If not, consider additional needs.
    1.3.2. Establish follow-on requirements. The SSG members will have the necessary experience to
    determine the best follow-on efforts that would apply for the system safety program.
    1.3.3. Review and evaluate hazard analyses. Generally, the best approach is to have the results of the
    analyses presented to the SSG. Usually, only a small portion of the SSG will want to perform a sepa-
AFMCPAM91-2 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                               5


   rate, detailed review of hazard analyses. In other cases, such as the F-22, most SSG members review
   and comment on the entire F-22 hazard analysis.
   1.3.4. Conduct independent analyses. In some cases, individual SSG members may have the experi-
   ence, expertise, and interest to conduct a separate independent safety analysis to solve a particular
   safety problem.
   1.3.5. Review and apply mishap and lessons learned data. The SSG members will have the experience
   with the weapon system and similar systems to be able to apply lessons learned data from other mis-
   haps and from field experience. Their experience will frequently augment the formal lessons learned
   program and the AFSC Design Handbook program.
   1.3.6. Evaluate engineering and modification proposals. The program office must always perform a
   safety evaluation for any proposal, but quite often the SSG can provide additional evaluation. Again,
   this can come from the members' experience and expertise.
   1.3.7. Confirm critical failure items. The SSG should confirm those components having a single fail-
   ure that could cause a critical or catastrophic hazard. Once identified in the hazard analyses and con-
   firmed by the SSG, the SSG should evaluate the risks involved, and recommend corrective action (i.e.,
   redesign or other compensation).
   1.3.8. Track safety modifications. The SSG should track safety modifications and time compliance
   technical orders (TCTO) until completion. If progress slows down (it usually does), the SSG can pro-
   vide additional emphasis or management attention to get things rolling again.
   1.3.9. Review significant (high interest) Category I Materiel Deficiency Reports (MDR) and mishap
   recommendations to ensure necessary and timely action is taken for correcting safety deficiencies.
   1.3.10. Provide exchange of information and experience among members.
   1.3.11. Prioritize hazards. The SSG should prioritize hazards based on severity and probability so that
   approval authorities can better determine the optimum degree of both safety and technical risk man-
   agement.

1.4. AFMC Policy on SSGs. AFI 91-202_AFMCS specifies the minimum requirements for SSGs.
These are:
   1.4.1. Each major weapon system (Acquisition Category 1), including all aircraft, and for some
   ground facilities and electronic installations requires an SSG; unless waived by HQ AFMC/SES.
   1.4.2. Meet at least annually. If the SSG convenes less frequently, members will lose continuity with
   the program and with each other. HQ AFMC/SES encourages more frequent SSGs for some weapon
   systems but has left the meeting frequency up to the individual SSG.
   1.4.3. It’s a good idea to augment SSGs with system safety working groups (SSWG)s when appropri-
   ate, described in Chapter 5. The SSWG cannot substitute for an SSG.
   1.4.4. The System Program Manager (SPM) or Single Manager (SSM), his/her deputy, or engineer-
   ing/ technical director/chief engineer chairs the meeting. He or she should chair the entire meeting, not
   just provide introductory remarks and then turn over the reins to someone else. His or her presence
   adds emphasis to the meeting. It also makes the members feel like they're really contributing to the
   meeting. The members will also benefit by getting the straight story directly from the SPM or SSM.
6                                                                 AFMCPAM91-2 3 FEBRUARY 2007


    The SPM/SSM benefits, too, by hearing the members' inputs firsthand. Finally, the SPM/SSM can
    make SSG decisions on the spot instead of deferring them.
    1.4.5. SSG membership will consist of the organizations listed in paragraph 1.5. Some organizations
    are advisory members (i.e., no voting power). For example, AFMC/SES is frequently an advisory
    member mainly because they cannot attend all SSG meetings. If an organization cannot regularly
    attend SSG meetings, then don’t list it as a primary or voting member.
    1.4.6. Send meeting notices to all participants 45-60 days before the meeting. This meeting notice
    will give date and place of the meeting, the point of contact, and a preliminary agenda. The notice
    should ask members to provide attendee data and additional agenda items by 30-45 days before the
    meeting.
    1.4.7. Provide a final agenda to each SSG participant 14-30 days before the meeting. This will give
    members sufficient time to research the problem or to get a unit or command position on the subject.
    If there are insufficient agenda items to warrant a meeting, then notify members that the meeting is
    canceled. (If you do that, then be sure to outline what’s going on for the few safety items and provide
    a point of contact for questions.)
    1.4.8. Publish and distribute meeting minutes within 30 calendar days after the meeting. You should
    also send provide minutes to member organizations that were unable to send a representative to the
    meeting.
    1.4.9. As a minimum, meeting minutes must include open action items, action agencies, suspense
    dates, and status of proposed corrective actions. Minutes should have enough information to describe
    SSG deliberations and results for those that were unable to attend the meeting.

1.5. SSG Members and Advisors. This paragraph describes the SSG members and advisors. In general,
SSG members are those organizations that are needed for each meeting and have the power to vote on
issues that arise. Advisors, on the other hand, are those who provide guidance and advice on certain
issues. They are not always required to attend each meeting and usually do not have voting power. Each
program can choose its own SSG members and advisors and must identify them in its SSG charter.
    1.5.1. System Program Manager (chairperson). The SPM/SSM, his/her deputy, or engineering/
    technical director/chief engineer is the SSG Chairperson, usually the full colonel program director or
    division chief. In a few cases, a general officer has chaired an SSG. This provides great emphasis to an
    SSG meeting, but can stifle communications - some people are hesitant to speak their minds in front
    of a general officer.
    1.5.2. Program Engineering. Usually members of the local engineering branch or IPT. They can
    provide technical advice and arrange for technical briefers.
    1.5.3. Program System Safety Representative. The system safety program manager (SSPM)
    assigned to the particular weapon system. This individual generally sets up and administers the meet-
    ing and writes the meeting minutes.
    1.5.4. Center Safety Office. The Center Safety Office will assign the full-time center system safety
    manager (CSSM) or, in his or her absence, the full-time flight safety representative, for aircraft SSGs;
    and the weapon safety officer for missile SSGs. Due to funding issues the CSSM will usually only
    attend those SSGs that are being held at the center and require no TDY funds.
AFMCPAM91-2 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                            7


  1.5.5. HQ AF Safety Center (HQ AFSC). The flight safety officer (HQ AFSC/SEF) or weapons
  safety officer (HQ AFSC/SEW) assigned to the weapon system. Each individual usually serves as an
  advisor.
  1.5.6. HQ AFMC Safety Office. This advisor will come from the system safety office (HQ AFMC/
  SES) or, in his or her absence, the flight safety office (SEF) for aircraft or the weapon safety office
  (SEW) for missiles.
  1.5.7. ALC Materiel Safety Officer (MSO). Primary interest is relationship of SSG issues to Mate-
  riel Safety Task Group issues.
  1.5.8. Using MAJCOM. Each using command (i.e., ACC, AMC, etc.) will provide a member to the
  SSG.
     1.5.8.1. Using MAJCOM Safety Office. Each using command will provide a member from its
     staff safety office. Some safety representatives may be accompanied by MAJCOM operational or
     maintenance staff members. In some cases, more than one major command will participate. For
     example, the F-15 SSG has representatives from ACC, USAFE, and PACAF.
     1.5.8.2. Using MAJCOM Requirements Office. These members will ensure safety requirements
     are incorporated in current or future program requirements.
     1.5.8.3. Using MAJCOM Operations Office. These members will bring operational safety issues
     and test issues to the SSG.
     1.5.8.4. Using MAJCOM Maintenance Office. These individuals usually attend SSGs that con-
     vene in conjunction with other forums, such as product improvement working groups (PIWG).
     These individuals can provide excellent advice for field problems, such as completing TCTOs.
  1.5.9. Numbered Air Force (NAF). The NAF flight or weapons safety officer.
  1.5.10. Each Operational Unit (optional). The flight safety officer (FSO) from each operational
  unit (wing or group) possessing the weapon system or, in the case of missiles, the missile safety
  officer. For some SSGs, this can be a large number of personnel. We’ve seen over 100 attendees at
  SSG meetings. In this case, it may be better to have the MAJCOM safety office represent the individ-
  ual operational units.
  1.5.11. Product Center System Program Office. Will send the Wing/Group/Squadron system
  safety officer/manager to SSGs for systems in which the system manager resides at a logistic center.
  1.5.12. ALC Product Directorate. May send the local SSPM to SSGs for systems managed by a
  product center.
  1.5.13. Foreign Military Sales Programs. Will result in SSG members from other countries pos-
  sessing the weapon system. This could create additional problems. Sanitize mishap data for presenta-
  tion at SSG meetings, so there will be no releases of sensitive data (AFI 91-204). You may have an
  awkward situation if two countries possess the same weapon system, but are not friendly to each other.
  Holding SSGs off base may alleviate base security concerns.
  1.5.14. Test Centers. From the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) and the Air Force Operational
  Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) when involved with the particular weapon system. Responsi-
  ble Test Organization (RTO) and Participating Test Organizations (PTOs) should also be invited.

NOTE: The AAC/SES personnel will greatly assist in determining if the weapon system can be approved
by the Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board (NNMSB). AAC/SES Office is the engineering/technical
advisors to the NNMSB and their expertise is recognized by the NNMSB and the Navy’s Weapon Explo-
sive Safety and Evaluation Review Board (WESERB). AAC/SES’ review of the weapon system design,
modification, and/or integration onto the aircraft will pay big dividends in the long run. The local flight
test office can inform the SSG on the flight tests of modified aircraft.
    1.5.15. Supporting ALCs. To support the primary ALC as required. For example, OC-ALC may
    send an engine representative, or OO-ALC may send a landing gear representative.
    1.5.16. Contractors. Airframe and major subsystem (e.g., engine) contractors may provide technical
    advisors to SSG meetings.
    1.5.17. Human Factors. This subject has been gaining more interest at SSG meetings, so the center
    human factors representative should participate.
    1.5.18. HQ Air Force. Some SAF offices will attend high visible AF SSGs to keep abreast of safety
    issues. SAF/AQ usually attends developing program’s SSGs, while SAF/XC or AF/TE may send
    attendees to other SSGs.

1.6. SSG Charter. The SSG is a chartered group. The charter will establish the purpose and scope of an
SSG, its function, limitations, and membership. It should:
    1.6.1. Outline the SSG tasks and responsibilities and provide the authority for assigning and complet-
    ing action items.
    1.6.2. Cover the procedures for handling SSG recommendations and action items including disagree-
    ments.
    1.6.3. List member organizations, particularly those responsible for setting up and chairing the meet-
    ing.
    1.6.4. In the list, use member organizations only not individual names, which change frequently.
    1.6.5. A sample SSG charter format is in Attachment 1. Coordinate the draft charter with the pro-
    posed SSG members and advisors. Members should approve the charter at the first meeting or shortly
    thereafter. The final charter should be signed by the SSG chairman.

1.7. Characteristics of SSGs at Logistics Centers. System safety groups were originally for develop-
ment programs managed by product centers. Eventually, SSGs supported ALC-managed systems and, as
a result, became involved with on-going operational systems instead of developing systems. These SSGs
developed their own unique characteristics:
    1.7.1. They primarily work problems that come from actual operational use of the system.
    1.7.2. They rarely perform, review, or evaluate hazard analyses. However, SSGs need to evaluate haz-
    ard analyses for major modifications.
    1.7.3. Some tend to be very large, due to the number of operational units that send members to the
    meetings. Some SSGs also have members from foreign countries that also own and operate the
    weapon system.

  1.7.4. SSGs complement Materiel Safety Task Groups (MSTG). Both groups have the ultimate goal
  of eliminating or controlling hazards, but there are two main differences:
     1.7.4.1. The SSG deals with identifying potential hazards before they cause mishaps, while the
     MSTG deals with reported hazards associated with operating the system.
     1.7.4.2. Most MSTGs consist only of center personnel while the SSG consists of members from
     many organizations, particularly those operating the system.

                                                 Chapter 2

                                       MEETING PREPARATION

2.1. Introduction. You’ve received coordination on the draft SSG charter-it is time to hold the first meet-
ing. This chapter describes the final preparations for the first and subsequent meetings. The chapter is
written to describe the efforts for a separate SSG, but many organizations prefer to combine an SSG with
another meeting, such as a program review or product improvement working group meeting. There is
nothing wrong with this idea, and it provides a chance to save considerable man-hours and TDY costs.

2.2. Establish the Meeting Date.
     2.2.1. Be sure the SPM and the SSPM will be available. These are the key people. The SPM chairs the
     meeting, but the SSPM really runs things. It's a very good idea to coordinate the proposed date with
     the local CSSM and the AFMC system safety office (HQ AFMC/SES) to be sure there are no conflicts
     with other meetings. After confirming the date, send notification to all SSG members at least 30-45
     days before the meeting date. In this notification, ask for attendee data (name, grade, organization,
     etc.) and ask for new agenda items. Be sure to get this information at least 30 days before the meeting
     so you can send out a final agenda two weeks before the meeting.
     2.2.2. Ask for detailed agenda items. Some SSG members will provide only a list of subjects. They
     should provide background information and state expectations of the SSG (i.e., design fix, special
     procedures, etc.). If a particular member fails to provide adequate details, call the member and get the
     details. If you ignore the item due to insufficient knowledge, be prepared for the item to come up at the
     meeting, anyway, because it probably will. We’ve seen this happen with the SPM and his staff unpre-
     pared to address the issue, because they were not notified beforehand.
     2.2.3. Be ready to change the meeting date if a schedule conflict occurs. This can easily happen.
     We’ve seen one SSPM spend Friday afternoon on the telephone calling all the SSG attendees that the
     following week’s meeting got postponed. Fortunately, everyone got the word before they started their
     travel.

2.3. Meeting Location. Set the place for the meeting. Obviously, this can affect the meeting date; if the
favorite conference room isn't available on a particular meeting date, consider moving it to another date.
About the meeting location:
     2.3.1. Avoid auditoriums; use a conference room setup. Have the SSG members feel like meeting par-
     ticipants, not observers.
     2.3.2. Anticipate a crowd. Some members bring additional people. In addition, many unannounced
     people will show up or stick their heads in the meeting. It's tough to accurately guess the number of
     attendees. We’ve seen as few as six and as many as over 100 attendees.
     2.3.3. Have good visual aid facilities. You might need a vugraph capability and may need a black-
     board/whiteboard, 35mm slides, or videotape facility. Electronic briefing aids, such as Powerpoint
     projectors, really make things run smoothly, but have backup charts available. Sometimes the elec-
     tronic equipment does not work properly or is incompatible with the briefers' software. Occasionally,
     you might be unable to find an operator with sufficient knowledge of the equipment. Practice using it
AFMCPAM91-2 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                              11


   before the meeting. Be sure that someone present has the necessary password to start up the electronic
   system for the meeting.
   2.3.4. Use a centrally located conference room, such as the organization’s main conference room.
   This will allow easy access to engineers and technicians that may have answers to problems being
   worked by the SSG.
   2.3.5. Sometimes contractor facilities host SSGs instead of program offices. This has the advantages
   of tapping the experts who are on-site to answer questions and showing the production line or actual
   hardware. The only disadvantage is the administrative headache of visitor clearances to the facility.
   2.3.6. One SSG holds some of its meetings at a hotel near the contractor facility. This might have the
   additional cost of renting a conference room, but largely eliminates the administrative headaches of
   visitor clearances, particularly for foreign country representatives.
   2.3.7. Don’t be bashful about charging a ‘registration fee’ or something similar to cover the costs of
   providing refreshments and for printing meeting materials. We all have budget problems. If they can
   afford to come to the meeting, they can afford a small additional fee, which is reimbursable on their
   travel orders.
   2.3.8. Some program offices have held an SSG via the video-teleconference (VTC) method. This can
   save a bundle of TDY costs, but you’ll deal with other factors:
       2.3.8.1. If you want to communicate with many locations, it can be very difficult to schedule all
       the locations simultaneously for a VTC. We’ve seen waiting times of over two months, and you
       can still get pre-empted by the local commander.
       2.3.8.2. Schedule VTCs for only one day. It’s difficult to schedule a VTC for more than two hours.
       It’s quite difficult to cover all SSG items in only two hours. Some program offices control the
       VTC network; so longer VTCs can be done, but keeping the busy chairperson in the SSG while at
       the base for more than one day can be very risky.
       2.3.8.3. Choreography can get awkward. Make sure someone really knows how to run the equip-
       ment. During one VTC, we sat there for several minutes listening to one AFB while viewing
       another attendee at another AFB who didn’t know he was ‘on the air.’
       2.3.8.4. In spite of the fact that more people are getting used to VTCs, there are still a number of
       people who are hesitant to speak up while ‘on the air’. Although we might appear overly cautious
       about using a VTC, we recommend that it be used whenever practical. People are getting more and
       more used to the idea and are more amenable to using a VTC to save valuable TDY costs. For
       small groups, such as SSWGs, a VTC can be very practical.
   2.3.9. Some SSGs use telephone conferences if time or funding is really tight. It is difficult to discuss
   items over the phone without seeing the charts or any object. Therefore, if someone 'dials in,' be sure
   that they have the presentation material beforehand.

2.4. Briefers. Give advance notice to the folks that will be briefing the SSG. Schedule the briefers
according to the SSG agenda. Be sure to get the right person to do the briefing. A substitute briefer may
not be able to answer all the questions. By the way, the most common question is something like: "When
will this problem be fixed, or when will this modification be completed in the field?" This is a tough ques-
tion, but briefers should be able to provide an idea when the mod is complete. Other appropriate questions
are "What risk level is associated with this deficiency" and "What risks are associated with continued use
12                                                                 AFMCPAM91-2 3 FEBRUARY 2007


until the modification is completed?" The SSG should consider these questions to determine priorities for
corrective actions. Encourage the briefers to have good quality briefing aids with illustrations. One picture
(even if it's a page from a technical order) sure helps to clarify what the subject is really about. Briefers
and other SSG personnel should have a professional appearance. A sloppy or disinterested person can cre-
ate the impression of not caring about his or her job or the SSG.

2.5. Arrangements. Good attendee arrangements can really get a meeting off to a good start. If SSG
attendees feel well cared for, they will certainly be more positive about the meeting and will be more pro-
ductive.
     2.5.1. Billeting for attendees can be handled in a number of ways. The SPM/SSM staff can arrange for
     all billeting by making reservations for all attendees. This provides good control and keeps the attend-
     ees together but creates more workload for the program office. An easier way is to have each attendee
     make his or her own arrangements. (The notification message should provide the billeting office
     phone number or a point of contact for off base billeting information.) This method relieves the SPM/
     SSM staff of additional workload. It also allows attendees to handle any special arrangements, such as
     staying longer for other meetings, or bringing along family members. In these cases, attendees are bet-
     ter off handling their own billeting arrangements.
     2.5.2. In some cases, arrange transportation, since some attendees will not have cars at their disposal.
     Most SSGs at one particular base have centralized on-base billeting with bus transportation to and
     from the meeting site. This has worked exceptionally well for SSG attendees. It also alleviates a
     chronic parking problem at the meeting location.
     2.5.3. Place cards at the table help identify SSG members. Generally, the place card should identify
     the member's name and organization.
     2.5.4. Breaks and refreshments need to be thought about. Breaks should be roughly every hour to
     allow SSG members to stretch, use the restroom, and get refreshments. Location of restrooms and
     what to do in an emergency should be discussed with the SSG member at the beginning of the SSG.
     Providing refreshments and/or locations where refreshments can be gotten is preferable. Refreshment
     fees can be requested.
     2.5.5. Social events can be planned to provide a sense of comradeship to the SSG attendees. Socials
     can be very elaborate as arranging a catered meal or as simple as arranging everyone go to lunch
     together.

2.6. Final Agenda. Provide the final agenda to each SSG member at least two weeks before the meeting.
The agenda should list the subject, times, and briefer or OPR. Some SSGs provide an agenda package that
gives background information and points of contact for each agenda item. Such a package allows each
SSG member to be better prepared for each agenda item. This should help avoid any surprises or misun-
derstandings at the meeting.

2.7. Brief the SPM. It’s important to brief the SSG chairperson (hopefully the SPM) before the SSG.
This will assure that he or she is familiar with all SSG items and will be ready for controversial items or
other possible surprises. The SSPM should sit down with the SPM and go through the agenda. If the SPM
wants to change anything, this is the time to do it. Give the SPM the full name and organization of each
briefer so that introductions will go smoothly.
AFMCPAM91-2 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                                13


                                                Chapter 3

                                             THE MEETING

3.1. Introduction and Welcome. The SPM calls the meeting to order, introduces himself or herself, and
welcomes the attendees. The SPM or SSPM then provides any administrative remarks, then each member
and attendees should introduce themselves to the group. This will ease communications and give mem-
bers a chance to know each other better.
   3.1.1. During administrative remarks the SSPM or facility host should describe where the restroom
   and refreshment facilities are located in relation to the meeting room and what to do in an emergency
   (tornado, fire, etc.).
   3.1.2. Recommend that all cell phones, Blackberry’s and other electronic devises be turned off or, at
   least, turned to vibrate during the meeting. Nothing is more annoying than a cell phone ringing during
   a meeting. Some facilities block electronic signals while inside. If that is the case, attendees need to be
   informed so they can step outside during breaks to check messages.

3.2. Review the SSG Charter. Review it for accuracy and currency. Usually, the only changes are to the
membership list. The best approach for reviewing the charter is to pass/send out copies to the members
when the final agenda is sent out and have them recommend any changes, preferably before the SSG.
Don't read aloud the entire charter; that can get boring.

3.3. Review Past SSG Minutes. It's a good idea to ask the SSG members if there are any recommended
changes to the minutes of the last meeting. Normally, there aren't any, but ensure clarification of errors or
omissions.

3.4. Program Status Briefing. After the introductions, the SPM should give a briefing on the status of
the weapon system program. This briefing should cover the fleet status, major milestones, and significant
modifications and other efforts. Some SPMs use a briefing that was prepared for a program assessment
review or other purpose. In any case, the briefing will set the stage for the SSG.

3.5. Mishap Briefing. The SSG member from HQ AFSC should give a mishap briefing that shows mis-
hap rates and trends, and highlights significant mishaps since the last meeting. Be sure to sanitize these
briefings, i.e., omit specific names, places, and tail numbers, so that the SSG doesn’t run into the privi-
leged information problem (AFI 91-204). This briefing should also include the AFSC areas of high inter-
est and concern.

3.6. Review Safety Modifications. SSGs review the status of safety modifications at each meeting. This
requirement came from the AFSC Board Look study in 1981 and certainly makes sense. The purpose of
this review is to have SSG members identify problems with getting a safety modification completed and
to recommend corrective action. This review also gives the SSG members an opportunity to see what
safety modifications are being done. Some SSGs have varied their definition of safety modifications. We
have seen the following included in different SSGs:
   3.6.1. Safety modifications.
   3.6.2. Safety-coded Engineering Change Proposals (ECP).
14                                                                 AFMCPAM91-2 3 FEBRUARY 2007


     3.6.3. Safety-coded Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO).
     3.6.4. Recommendations from significant (e.g., Class A) mishaps.
     3.6.5. Someone's own idea of "what affects safety".
     3.6.6. Review of the high accident potential (HAP) messages with AFMC recommendations that have
     occurred since the last meeting.
     Which of these require review? All of them; they all affect the overall safety of the weapon system.
     How is the review done? Review can be done by any suitable method, such as handouts or briefing
     charts listing the modifications and their status. A knowledgeable person should be there to answer
     questions.

3.7. Review Hazard Analyses. Occasionally, an SSG will need to review a hazard analysis. If this
should happen, arrange for a presentation of the results of the analysis, i.e., significant hazards identified
and their corrective action. Some SSG members might lack the specific training to conduct a detailed
review of a hazard analysis, but all the members take interest in the results. There may be a few members
who wish to review a detailed analysis. These members can form a separate SSWG to review the particu-
lar analysis and report back to the SSG.

3.8. Briefings. A briefing of some sort covers most SSG discussion and action items. Some briefings are
straight from the table, but the majority use charts or other visual aids. Based on our experience with
SSGs, we'd like to pass on some lessons learned (constructive criticism) about briefings.
     3.8.1. Briefers should have a professional appearance and attitude. Sloppy briefers come across as if
     they don't care about their job or the SSG.
     3.8.2. Use visual aids. Let's face it; a picture is worth a thousand words. Even briefing aids without
     pictures will really improve communications. Remember, people retain most of what they see and
     hear.
     3.8.3. Use illustrations. Explaining a hardware item is much easier if the briefing includes a picture or
     drawing of the item. In many cases, a picture of a tech order page will easily suffice. The illustrations
     should show the item location and what it looks like. Sometimes a cutaway illustration will help a dis-
     cussion, but do not overdo it. We have seen more than one SSG get lost going through a detailed cut-
     away illustration. Electrical schematic diagrams can be risky, too. Chances are most SSG members
     can't read a detailed schematic. Some briefers, however, have successfully used simplified redrawn
     schematics to get their point across. A combined picture and text briefing chart (Attachment 2) really
     gets the point across.
     3.8.4. Provide some brief background on the subject because SSG members may not be familiar with
     the subject. This is usually due to high turnover of members, but can also happen if the item has only
     been a problem for some units. Other units could use the background in case they run into the problem
     later.
     3.8.5. List alternate solutions considered and provide a rational for the one selected. Some SSG mem-
     bers may have experience in the particular area and may offer improvements.
     3.8.6. Provide the exact present status of the problem and the predicted get well date. The most fre-
     quently asked question will be: "When will we see this fix (solution) incorporated in the field?" Brief-
AFMCPAM91-2 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                              15


   ers should have some idea of the answer, but a precise answer is almost impossible thanks to the
   bureaucratic maze we live in.
   3.8.7. Other questions will pop up and the briefers may not have all the answers. In these cases,
   research the answers before the end of the SSG meeting, if possible, or contact the person who asked
   the original question. If that's not possible, provide the answers in the minutes to the meeting. Don't
   wait until the next SSG meeting, which may be a year away.

3.9. Operating Problems. During the meeting, several operating problems will crop up. The following
subparagraphs describe some of these problems and methods of coping with them. Most of the responsi-
bility lies with the chairperson, so he or she will need a good understanding of SSG philosophy and func-
tions.
   3.9.1. Defining the problem can be difficult at times. In some cases, the members can’t even decide:
   "Is this a safety problem?" The best person to answer the question should be the local program SSPM,
   but the chairperson will make the final decision. Some members will use the forum to air out a partic-
   ular issue as "discussion items"; any requiring safety resolution are then defined as "action items" and
   formally tracked.
   3.9.2. Getting sidetracked from the central problem can slow down a meeting's progress. If sidetrack-
   ing identifies a separate safety issue, handle it as a new action item or as a separate SSWG. Otherwise,
   keep the discussion on track. Again, the chairperson should hold the meeting together.
   3.9.3. Don't be too eager to close an item. We have seen some cases when an item was closed before
   reaching a full solution. It's hard to say exactly when to close an issue, but the SSG should continue to
   work an item at least through approval by the Configuration Control Board, or other appropriate mile-
   stone. After that point; the SSPM will monitor the item to ensure that its completion doesn’t get
   bogged down.
   3.9.4. A consolidated user opinion or position is necessary for resolving an SSG issue. There are two
   types of user problems:
       3.9.4.1. One using command (e.g., ACC) may agree with a particular solution, while another
       (e.g., USAFE) may disagree. The SSG will need to vote on the issue, and other using commands
       may carry the vote one way or the other.
       3.9.4.2. A single using command may be unable to come up with a consolidated position. One
       using command's safety staff could not agree with the operations and maintenance staffs over an
       SSG fire protection issue, so the chairperson tabled the issue until they could. If a using command
       headquarters sends only safety people to an SSG meeting, try to make sure they can speak for the
       entire using command headquarters. If they cannot, then they must be able to get a consolidated
       position from their home command.
       3.9.4.3. Some SSG members may want to design a solution on the spot. Nice idea, but it's best to
       assign that work to someone with detailed knowledge, and to give that person enough time to
       study the problem thoroughly before recommending a design solution to the SSG.
   3.9.5. Good leadership is a must for an effective SSG meeting. It's important to have the SPM chair
   the meeting and to have him or her convinced of the importance of the meeting. During one SPM’s
   introduction, the SPM went on to say how important the meeting was, etc. The SPM then left the SSG
   for another meeting, and never returned. What does that do for meeting effectiveness?
16                                                                   AFMCPAM91-2 3 FEBRUARY 2007


3.10. SSPM Actions. The SSPM will probably be the busiest person during the meeting. He or she
should:
     3.10.1. Show up early to turn on lights, coffee pot (include sugar, cream, stirrers, etc.), and make sure
     audio and visual aids and other devices work. Make sure someone knows how to use the high-tech
     briefing aids.
     3.10.2. Sit next to the chairperson and keep things in order.
     3.10.3. Begin and circulate an attendance list to include attendees' name, organization, and phone
     number. Distribute copies, typed if possible, before the end of the meeting.
     3.10.4. Think two or three agenda items ahead in order to line up presenters and to take care of sched-
     ule glitches.
     3.10.5. Suggest SSWGs when needed.
     3.10.6. Make administrative announcements.
     3.10.7. Record all SSG action items and give the list to the chairperson so he or she can summarize
     them at the end of the meeting.
     3.10.8. Have SSG members fill out SSG action items when applicable. Consider completing SSG
     action items using the format suggested in Attachment 3.
     3.10.9. Maintain an SSG action item log to keep track of open action items. This log should have
     entries for item number, subject, initiator, OPR, reply due date, and status.
     3.10.10. Take as many notes as necessary to facilitate writing the meeting minutes.

3.11. Concluding the Meeting:
     3.11.1. When the meeting ends, do not just send everyone off. A good meeting needs a good conclu-
     sion. Summarize key items and read aloud (or pass out) all action items so that everyone goes home
     with a complete understanding of each task. This final action item review should identify the specific
     action, who should do it, and when. Identify specific suspense dates and avoid 'by the next SSG meet-
     ing" which may be a long time later.
     3.11.2. One of our centers conducts ‘customer satisfaction’ surveys at its SSGs. Near the end of each
     meeting, each attendee gets a form allowing him or her to provide anonymous comments on the oper-
     ation of that SSG. This information can be beneficial for future SSGs.
     3.11.3. While everyone is still there, set the date for the next meeting. If some won’t agree to a spe-
     cific date, at least get everyone to agree on the approximate time (month and year) and place for the
     next meeting.
     3.11.4. Finally, thank everyone for their contribution, and keep things on a positive note.

                                        AFTER THE MEETING

4.1. Write the Meeting Minutes. Fortunately, there is no standard or regulatory format for minutes of
the meeting. As a result, some minutes are in letter format, while others are a package or book with each
page detailing an action item. The format does not matter as long as the minutes communicate essential
information i.e., what happened during the meeting? Minutes should include at least the following:
   4.1.1. The agenda that can serve as a "table of contents."
   4.1.2. The SSG charter so members will have the most current version.
   4.1.3. The list of attendees with organizations and telephone numbers.
   4.1.4. Narrative summary of the SSG proceedings for each discussion item and action item. The min-
   utes don't need to be long, but there should be enough narrative so that members who missed the meet-
   ing will know what happened. For reference purposes, the minutes should include the rationale for all
   SSG decisions.
   4.1.5. Presentation materials, such as briefing charts, are optional. Usually, the best approach is to
   provide charts that really help the minutes. Some SSG minutes include no charts while others include
   every single chart. It's up to the individual SSG. If the minutes include many charts, we suggest reduc-
   ing the size so that two charts fit on a single page, unless the charts cannot be read in the reduced size.
   4.1.6. The minutes should definitely include a list of action items. This list should spell out what
   tasks, who will do it, and when. Be sure the action agency has accepted the action item; don't surprise
   them in the minutes.
   4.1.7. Plans for the next meeting. Usually the exact date and location will not be available, but at least
   include the general location and approximate date (e.g., ‘June 2008 at Wright-Patterson AFB’).

4.2. Publish the Meeting Minutes. Sometimes publishing the minutes can be tougher than writing
them. Minutes need to be written, then approved by the SSG chairperson. They can be copied (usually by
base printing because of their size and number of copies) and finally put in the mail. The total process
takes some time which can vary greatly. (We've seen as few as eight days between the meeting and distri-
bution of minutes and we've seen it take 5 months. Our policy is 30 days after the meeting, and all SSGs
should be able to meet that deadline.) Two easy ways to distribute minutes: e-mail, and the Internet. (In
the case of the internet, publish the minutes on your organization’s home web page.) Both methods can be
significant time and cost savers, and nearly everyone has the technical capability, so this can work very
well. Supporting briefing charts can easily accompany the minutes in either case.

4.3. Distribute the Meeting Minutes. We recommend that SSG meeting minutes be distributed to the
following:
   4.3.1. Each SSG member, whether they attended or not.
   4.3.2. Each office that provided an attendee, even if that office is not a member.
   4.3.3. The HQ AFMC system safety office.
   4.3.4. The Air Force Safety Center .

     4.3.5. Your Center safety office.

4.4. Follow-up.
     4.4.1. Much to their credit, a few SSGs provide interim action item status to all members between
     meetings by letter, message, etc. The E-3 SSG has successfully used an action item progress report
     (Attachment 4) to request updated status from action agencies. These ideas really help to keep
     actions going and to keep members aware of what's going on without the expense of holding more fre-
     quent meetings. In the interests of flexibility, we have not made this a requirement but we certainly
     encourage other SSGs to do the same.
     4.4.2. If you conducted a customer satisfaction survey of any sort, review it for improvements for
     future SSG meetings.

                        SYSTEM SAFETY WORKING GROUPS (SSWG)

5.1. What is an SSWG? Think of an SSWG as an informal, local subset of an SSG. An SSWG is usually
formed when a full SSG wants to research a problem but does not want to tie up the full membership. The
SSG will generally form an SSWG to work a problem separately and report back to the SSG. An SSWG
augments an SSG; it's not a substitute.

5.2. Characteristics. An SSWG operates somewhat like an SSG, but has different characteristics.
   5.2.1. An SSWG usually works a single problem or issue, then disbanded - much like a process action
   team (PAT).
   5.2.2. SSWG membership is limited, usually to local engineering and safety personnel, and to other
   interested parties. Membership depends on the given situation. There are no regulatory requirements
   for SSWG members.
   5.2.3. SSWGs generally don't need a charter.
   5.2.4. The local SSPM is a more appropriate chairperson for working groups - not the SPM.
   5.2.5. There are no requirements for SSWG meeting minutes; however, the SSWG may need to write
   minutes to document their findings and to present them to the SSG.

5.3. Examples of SSWGs. SSWGs can be formed for many problems. Examples are:
   5.3.1. Evaluating the system safety program for an engine used in an aircraft.
   5.3.2. Assisting a contractor performing a hazard analysis on modified weapons jettison circuit.
   5.3.3. Recommending employment of a new fire detection and fire suppression system.
   5.3.4. Drafting aircrew procedures during hot refueling of an aircraft.

                           F-X SYSTEM SAFETY GROUP (SSG) CHARTER

A1.1. Introduction:
     A1.1.1. A System Safety Group (SSG) is required in accordance with AFI 91-202, Chapter 9 and AFI
     91-202_AFMCS. A System Safety Working Group (SSWG) may also be established and convened at
     the direction of the SSG Chairperson. The SSG membership and operating procedures detailed herein
     are intended to fulfill the applicable requirements of Air Force policy directives established to ensure
     the safety of the F-X weapon system operations.

A1.2. Purpose:
     A1.2.1. The F-X SSG is established to consider actual and potential safety problems associated with
     operation and maintenance of the F-X weapon system with emphasis on mishap prevention. The SSG
     is to identify, discuss, and define safety issues related to the F-X weapon system. The purpose is to
     provide the System Program Manager (SPM) risk assessments with recommendations on the relative
     priorities when resolving valid safety deficiencies/issues. Decisions of the SSG will constitute recom-
     mendations to the SPD. The SSG or SPD may withhold a decision until A Program Management
     Review or Executive Review, as appropriate.

A1.3. Functions:
     A1.3.1. Coordinate all safety related activities pertaining to the F-X weapon system.
     A1.3.2. Take advantage of special experience and expertise of members and advisors.
     A1.3.3. Identify, track, and resolve specific safety problems or deficiencies.
     A1.3.4. Review, evaluate, and augment the safety analyses of hazards.
     A1.3.5. Consider differing viewpoints on the systems' design, operation, or test results before arriving
     at a safety position.
     A1.3.6. Identify safety critical items and assess critical single-point failures.
     A1.3.7. Review safety related engineering change proposals, deviations, and waivers.
     A1.3.8. Consider lessons learned on similar aircraft and missions to help avoid or eliminate potential
     hazards.
     A1.3.9. Monitor corrective action on safety deficiencies which have been identified by Hazard Anal-
     yses, mishap investigations, and deficiency reports.
     A1.3.10. Review testing procedures that are brought before the group which are used to verify safety
     of flight requirements.
     A1.3.11. Ensure Technical and Flight Manuals (dash one) are thoroughly reviewed to determine that
     necessary caution and warning notes and emergency procedures are included.
        A1.3.11.1. Act as a sounding board for safety issues identified by its members.
     A1.3.12. Review aircraft modifications for safety considerations.
AFMCPAM91-2 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                            21


A1.4. Authority:
   A1.4.1. AFI 91-202,, and AFI 91-202_AFMCS, provides the authority to establish the SSG. All find-
   ings of the SSG constitute recommendations to the SPD.

A1.5. Chairperson:
   A1.5.1. The Deputy System Program Manager (SPM) is the Chairperson of the SSG. Action items
   will be assigned by the SSG Chairperson, who has final approval authority for the SSG minutes.

A1.6. Membership:
   A1.6.1. Permanent memberships for the SSG will include representatives from the organizations
   listed in the attachment to this charter. Members may be added or deleted from the list as deemed nec-
   essary by the Chairperson.
   A1.6.2. Members are selected because of their close association with the operation, maintenance,
   design, testing, and deployment of the system. Member participation in the SSG is essential to provide
   an understanding and interpretation of the requirements from which the system design developed, and
   to provide an input for their organizations on issues that arise throughout the life cycle of the F-X
   weapon system.
   A1.6.3. Membership responsibilities:
      A1.6.3.1. Respond to action items assigned by the Chairperson.
      A1.6.3.2. Have the authority to express or be responsible for getting the official position of their
      organization regarding the F-X system safety issues.
      A1.6.3.3. When notified of an SSG meeting, submit to the SPM recommended agenda items as
      required. Be prepared to brief the SSG on the proposed agenda item, describing the area of con-
      cern.
      A1.6.3.4. When notified of the SSG agenda items, be prepared to discuss and act upon the agenda
      items.
      A1.6.3.5. When assigned action items, be prepared to report the findings and results by the estab-
      lished suspense to the SSG.
      A1.6.3.6. Attend all F-X SSG meetings. If an alternate is sent, that person must be thoroughly
      briefed on the status of the program and be prepared to actively participate in the meeting.
      A1.6.3.7. Be familiar with the applicable system safety documents.

A1.7. Advisors:
   A1.7.1. Advisors to the SSG will include, but not be limited to, representatives from organizations
   listed in the attachment. Additional advisors may be summoned as deemed necessary by the Chairper-
   son.
   A1.7.2. Advisors provide specialized expertise to the Chairperson and the SSG with updates on regu-
   latory and policy changes as they pertain to the F-X program.
   A1.7.3. Advisor responsibilities:
22                                                               AFMCPAM91-2 3 FEBRUARY 2007


        A1.7.3.1. When assigned action items, be prepared to report the findings and results by the estab-
        lished suspense to the SSG.
        A1.7.3.2. Thoroughly study issues assigned to them and provide a qualified opinion and/or rec-
        ommended action, as applicable, to the SSG.
        A1.7.3.3. Act as a safety liaison between their respective organization and the F-X SSG.
        A1.7.3.4. Furnish their organization's policy guidance applicable to the F-X System Safety Pro-
        gram.
        A1.7.3.5. Provide additional, qualified guidance and information to the SSG on F-X safety issues
        ass related to their specialty.

A1.8. Administration:
     A1.8.1. The central point of contact and coordination for SSG meetings is ABC/XYZ, Building 350,
     750 3rd Street, Smythington AFB CA.
     A1.8.2. The system safety program manager (SSPM) will record SSG meeting proceedings and gen-
     erate and distribute meeting minutes.
     A1.8.3. The SSPM will ensure approved meeting minutes are compiled and distributed to all SSG
     members, advisors, and attendees within 30 days following the meeting.
     A1.8.4. Report on action items will be in briefing format to the SPD and included in the SSG minutes.
     A1.8.5. Recommendations will be annotated in the minutes.
     A1.8.6. All organizations listed in the attachment are responsible for providing to the SSPM a list of
     names designating their primary and alternate members of the SSG.
     A1.8.7. The basic approach for the F-X SSG will be to require majority agreement. However, the
     final decision lies with the SPM. In the case of an unresolved disagreement, individual reports may be
     submitted to the SPM within 10 (calendar) days after the SSG meeting for inclusion into the minutes
     as a matter of record. Unresolved issues may become agenda items for the Program Management
     Review or Executive Review.
     A1.8.8. Changes to the charter can be recommended to the SSG by any member. Changes to the char-
     ter will be discussed along with the recommended written change submitted to the SSG Chairperson.
     This will be annotated in the minutes and discussed and voted on at the next SSG. A simple majority
     will rule.

A1.9. System Safety Working Group (SSWG):
     A1.9.1. A SSWG can be established at any time by the SSG Chairperson for the purpose of evaluating
     and providing recommendations to the SSG on specific safety issues. The SSWG would therefore be
     a subset of the SSG. Membership of the SSWG will consist of selected SSG members plus selected
     technical advisors as deemed necessary by the SSG Chairperson. The findings of the SSWG will be
     reported to the SSG Chairperson and reviewed at the subsequent SSG.
AFMCPAM91-2 3 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                                23


A1.10. General:
   A1.10.1. Action Item Log. The AI log will be reviewed by all members on an “as required" basis. If
   a disagreement in closure status exists, or if a significant level of risk must be accepted, the issue will
   be addressed by the SSG. The AI log status will be presented at each SSG meeting. All Action Items
   and Hazards will be tracked. The database will be updated by the SSPM.
   A1.10.2. The SSG will meet at least twice a year, approximately 45 days prior to the Program Man-
   agement Review and Executive Review. The schedule will be determined by the SPM.
   A1.10.3. Notice of SSG meetings will be forwarded to members and advisors at least 30 days before
   the meeting.
   A1.10.4. The SPD will make the final decision on all F-X safety issues. Consideration will be given
   to the inputs and recommendations of SSG members and advisors.
