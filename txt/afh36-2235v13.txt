                                             Overview


Introduction          This handbook serves as a guide for applying the Instructional Systems
                      Development (ISD) process to the analysis, design, development,
                      implementation, and evaluation of Basic Military Training (BMT) in the
                      Air Force. It adheres to the policies of AFI 36-2201 and follows the
                      principles and procedures outlined in AFMAN 36-2234.


Target audience for   The handbook is specifically targeted at BMT curriculum developers;
handbook              however, it can be used as a source of valuable information concerning
                      ISD for instructors and managers alike. While it is designed as a
                      "stand-alone" document, you should read and be familiar with AFI
                      36-2201 and AFMAN 36-2234.


Background            In the past, the Air Force ISD manual and handbook were focused on how
                      ISD applied to technical training. There was little or no guidance on
                      applying the ISD process to other areas such as BMT. The revised
                      AFMAN 36-2234 provides the guidance and procedures necessary for
                      applying the ISD process throughout the Air Force, regardless of the type
                      of training or education being developed. Additional volumes of AFH
                      36-2235 provide specific guidance and procedures for applying ISD to
                      aircrew training, acquisition, education, and technical training. Other
                      volumes of AFH 36-2235 have been developed to cover applications of
                      ISD in other areas such as computer-based training (CBT) selection and
                      interactive courseware (ICW) decisions.


Purpose               This handbook provides specific information and guidance for using the
                      instructional development process to maintain the BMT program. It
                      provides information on the phases of the ISD process .

Goal of training   The goal of Air Force training is to develop performance-based,
                   criterion-reference training that promotes transfer of learning from the
                   training setting to the job. For a learning outcome to be achieved, training
                   must be effective and efficient. Training is effective when it teaches
                   objectives based on job performance requirements and efficient when it
                   makes the best use of resources.


What is ISD?       ISD is a systematic, but flexible process used to analyze, design, develop,
                   and implement training in an effective and cost-efficient manner. It is a
                   comprehensive process that continuously strives to improve training
                   programs through continuous evaluation. ISD ensures that:

                      Training needs are identified based on job performance requirements .
                      What is being trained are those skills, knowledge, and attitudes most
                      critical to job performance.
                      Standards of performance and objectives are identified that mimic the
                      job environment as closely as possible.
                      The training method and media chosen support the subject matter and
                      the target audience, and are time and cost efficient.
                      Trainees are evaluated on their ability to meet objectives that mirror
                      job behaviors .
                      Training materials are evaluated on their ability to allow mastery of
                      objectives.
                      Revisions to training are continuously identified and made to improve
                      the training program.


Goal of ISD        The goal of ISD is to produce graduates who can perform their jobs after
                   receiving training and to reduce overall costs of training by accurately
                   identifying training requirements.
AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003                                                                     5



Why use ISD?     ISD is a set of comprehensive guidelines that serve as a blueprint for
                 organizing and structuring the training development process. The Air
                 Force uses the ISD process as a tool to ensure quality training programs
                 are developed. This process enables continuous, measurable
                 improvements in the quality of the training development process. There
                 are a number of reasons why you should use the ISD process including:


                    ISD is a flexible system whose steps are not performed in a lock-step,
                    linear fashion. While the ISD phases are performed sequentially, there
                    is flexibility in ISD to go back and revisit data from a previous phase
                    and use these data to make decisions regarding a later phase. This
                    makes ISD a continuous, cyclical process that allows any phase to
                    occur at any time. Whether revising training materials or developing
                    them from scratch, this flexibility enables the ISD process to be
                    applied.
                    Each phase of ISD is dependent upon another. The data collected and
                    generated in one phase are used in subsequent phases. As you
                    progress through the different phases of ISD, the processes and
                    products of each phase are constantly evaluated against the training
                    requirements identified in the previous phases, as well as principles of
                    learning. Because each phase within ISD builds upon the previous
                    phase, ISD serves as a system of checks and balances to ensure all
                    training data are accounted for and nothing "falls through the cracks."
                    This ensures what is being trained truly supports job performance.
                    ISD emphasizes criterion-based training. The criteria are directly
                    linked to performance requirements. Field representatives (e.g.,
                    supervisors, squadron commanders) identify training requirements,
                    which training providers such as Air Education and Training
                    Command (AETC) or other training organizations are then under
                    "contract" to satisfy. The ISD process continually traces the
                    relationship between job requirements and the training environment so
                    the focus on actual job requirements is never lost.
                    ISD reduces the number of training program decisions that have to be
                    made subjectively and, instead, allows decisions to be made based on
                    reasonable conclusions which are based on carefully collected and
                    analyzed data. More than one solution to a training problem may be
                    identified, but the goal of ISD is to select the best solution.

Results of ISD   ISD results in quality training programs that produce:

                   Increased ability of trainees to perform on the job.
                   Training products that can be developed with less rework, less waste,
                   and fewer errors.
                   Training products that are easy to use and maintain.

                INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT MODEL



                                          Overview


Introduction      Designing, developing, and supporting the Basic Military Training (BMT)
                  program require considerable time and effort on the part of curriculum
                  developers. Curriculum developers are responsible for analyzing,
                  designing, and developing effective and cost-efficient training. In addition,
                  curriculum developers are responsible for evaluating and maintaining
                  training materials to ensure their continued effectiveness in supporting Air
                  Force doctrine, philosophy, and values.


Air Force ISD     The ISD model is designed to provide simplicity and flexibility so that
model             curriculum developers with varying levels of expertise can understand the
                  model and use it to develop effective, cost-efficient training programs. The
                  model further supports the flexibility that curriculum developers have to
                  enter or reenter the various stages of the process as necessary to create or
                  revise training materials. The nature and scope of the development,
                  update, or revision effort determine the entry or reentry into a particular
                  stage of the process.

ISD phases   Figure 1 shows the phases in the systems approach, which are analysis,
             design, development, and implementation, with evaluation activities inte-
             grated into each phase of the process. All phases of the model depend on
             each of the other phases. Evaluation is shown as the central feedback "net-
             work" for the total system. The Evaluation Phase fosters continuous qual-
             ity improvement of the training program by reviewing the data generated
             in each phase to ensure they meet the needs of the target audience.


             Figure 1 ISD Phases




             The instructional development process, which the model summarizes, calls
             for curriculum developers to :


               Analyze and determine what training is needed.
               Design training to meet the need.
               Develop training materials that support job requirements.
               Support implementation of the training program.
               Evaluate all phases of training throughout the ISD process.
AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003                                                                         9



Analysis phase      Any training development effort is predicated upon careful and thorough
                    planning. If a training need is identified, in the Analysis Phase curriculum
                    developers will determine the common tasks, knowledge, and attitudes
                    that all airmen must possess for successful job performance. In this phase,
                    curriculum developers will analyze knowledge and attitudes through
                    conduct of an educational analysis. If a task was identified as a deficiency
                    in job performance, curriculum developers will conduct a task analysis to
                    break down the tasks into subtasks (performance steps), conditions, and
                    standards. Curriculum developers will further conduct a learning analysis
                    to establish learning outcomes and update the course training standard to
                    reflect any revisions to BMT.


Design phase        During the Design Phase, curriculum developers build the framework
                    from which training is developed including the development of learning
                    objectives and tests and the selection of media. Existing training materials
                    are reviewed during this phase to determine their applicability to the
                    specific instruction under development. What is done in this phase plays a
                    key role in determining the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the
                    training that will be developed in the next phase of the ISD process.


Development phase   The Development Phase builds upon the data gathered during the Analysis
                    and Design Phases. After objectives, tests, and instructional strategies
                    have been determined, the training materials are fleshed out to develop
                    lesson plans and accompanying trainee materials. Media are further
                    developed. During this phase, curriculum developers validate the training
                    materials to identify any deficiencies that must be corrected.
                    Validation includes technical accuracy reviews (formative evaluation) and
                    operational field tryouts (summative evaluation) .


Implementation      In the Implementation Phase, the training program is fielded under
phase               operational conditions. At this point, after analysis, design, and
                    development are completed, the curriculum developer's role is limited to
                    supporting delivery of the training. The curriculum developer is also
                    responsible for evaluating trainee performance and reporting evaluation
                    results during implementation (these functions will be covered in the
                    Evaluation Phase chapter).

Evaluation phase   Evaluation is a continuous process beginning during the Analysis Phase
                   and continuing throughout the life cycle of the training program. The
                   Evaluation Phase of ISD measures training program effectiveness and
                   efficiency. Evaluation consists of formative and summative evaluations,
                   which are covered in Chapter 6, Development Phase. It also consists of
                   operational evaluation, which supports periodic internal and external
                   evaluation of the training program during the Implementation Phase.

                                       Analysis


What it is       In the Analysis Phase, job requirements common to all airmen are
                 identified. These job requirements include:

                   Tasks
                   Knowledge
                   Attitudes



Why do it?       Analysis is necessary to define job performance requirements. This
                 phase is important because it ensures you get the right training for the
                 stated need .



Outcomes         Proper analysis results in:

                   Tasks defining job performance
                   Knowledge and attitudes required of successful job performance
                   Job tasks and knowledge translated into behaviors performed in the
                   training environment
                   Learning outcomes in terms of types of learning involved and level of
                   learning desired

                                      Design


 What it is   The Design Phase builds the structure or foundation of a training
              program. In the Analysis Phase, job requirements in the form of tasks,
              knowledge, and attitudes were identified. The Design Phase will build
              upon those requirements to translate them into behaviors performed in
              the training environment.



 Why do it?   The Design Phase is important because it establishes the objectives of
              training. The goal of this phase is to simulate as closely as possible the
              real-world job conditions within the training environment. The more
              closely the training conditions are to the real world, the more likely it is
              that the trainee will transfer the learning to the job. The curriculum
              developer builds into the instruction those conditions that are necessary
              for effective and efficient learning to occur.



 Outcomes     Proper design results in:

                Grouped and sequenced objectives reflecting job performance
                requirements.
                Tests that measure the objectives.
                Training methods, media, and strategies to deliver the training.
                A Course Training Plan (CTP) that defines instructional and resource
                requirements in support of the course.

 What it is      In the Design Phase, objectives, tests, strategies, and media were
                 determined. The Development Phase builds on the information gathered
                 during the Design Phase by fleshing out lesson plans that detail the
                 instructional content. During ISD development you develop, validate,
                 and revise the training.



 Why do it?      It is in the Development Phase that training materials and media are
                 developed.


                 Development results in validated:

What it is       In the Implementation Phase, the training program is implemented and
                 the course becomes operational.



Why do it?       It is in the Implementation Phase that the work completed in the
                 Analysis, Design, and Development Phases comes to fruition with
                 delivery of the training program to the trainee population.



Outcomes         Successfully implemented training results in graduates who meet job

                                       Evaluation


 What it is      Evaluation measures the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of a
                 training program. It is a continuous process performed in all phases of
                 ISD and throughout the life cycle of the training program. Evaluation
                 answers the questions :

                   Is the training program effective and cost-efficient?
                   Are quality products being developed?
                   How well are course graduates performing on the job?
                   How can the training program be improved?



 Why do it?      Evaluation improves the quality of the ISD process and products while
                 producing graduates who can meet job performance requirements.



 Outcomes        Evaluation provides data on the quality of the ISD process and products
                 and identifies revisions that should be made to improve the program.
                 Evaluation further assesses trainee performance and whether graduates
                 are meeting job performance requirements .

                                        Overview



Introduction     Effective and cost-efficient training must be planned. Planning is a key
                 element in the management of the overall training program as well as in
                 the ISD process itself. Inadequate planning is costly. Training must be
                 planned so that resources are not spent on things that do not need to be
                 trained. Planning ensures what is being trained are those knowledge,
                 skills, and attitudes most critical to successful job performance .

                                     Section A
                                   Identify Needs


Introduction     In the Planning Phase of ISD, needs are identified that trigger a
                 requirement for training. BMT curriculum developers are not
                 responsible for identifying needs. Training needs are generated by Air
                 Force operational forces. There are a couple of avenues for identifying
                 and communicating these needs to BMT curriculum developers.



Out of cycle     Training needs may be initiated by Out of Cycle requirements identified
requirements     by higher headquarters or operational forces. These requirements may be
                 identified at any time and subsequent tasking for training development
                 will be given to BMT curriculum developers by higher headquarter
                 elements.



BMT Review       The training content of BMT is determined by members of the BMT
                 Review Committee. Ideally, it is the role of these committee members to
                 identify needs.



BMT Review       Committee members include senior officers from:
committee
member s           Headquarters, Air Force
                   Headquarters Air Education and Training Command
                   2nd Air Force
                   37th Training Wing

                 In addition, members include:

                   Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
                   Command Chief Master Sergeants
20                                                              AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003



 Purpose of BMT     The purpose of the BMT Review Committee is to determine the training
 Review Committee   requirements for BMT based on Air Force operational requirements. The
                    committee determines the requirements for BMT graduate performance,
                    military training, military studies, initial enlisted training, curriculum
                    course standards, and other items of special interest based on the current
                    and future needs of the Air Force. Committee members, in particular
                    CMSgts, are in tune with the needs of the operational forces due to their
                    day-to-day contact with airmen and their diverse missions. As such, they
                    are in a position to identify a deficiency in performance or a need for
                    training. The committee ensures that all BMT requirements are
                    rationally based and validated to satisfy Air Force operational
                    requirements.



 Training needs     A training needs assessment (TNA) is the process of identifying a
 assessment (TNA)   deficiency or gap between current performance and desired
                    performance. A deficiency exists when the actual performance level is
                    below the optimal level of performance that has been established. The
                    deficiency or gap equates to a need. A TNA is ideally conducted by the
                    BMT Review Committee prior to attending the review.



 What signals a     Needs may come from several different sources. Many needs are
 training need?     identified because personnel are not meeting job performance
                    requirements. Other needs may be identified by a philosophical change
                    in the Air Force mission that requires attitudinal changes. The following
                    may signal a need that should be trained in BMT:

                      Changes in Air Force doctrine, mission, or policy make existing
                      training obsolete or cause new training to be required.
                      Acquisition of new technology or equipment.
                      Instruction in a topic is mandated from higher headquarters.
                      Changes in fundamental Air Force goals and objectives require a
                      change in attitudes.
                      Changes in standard of performance.
                      Evaluations of mission readiness.
                      Accident board findings.

identified ?     Out of Cycle requirement.
                 Having this completed prior to the BMT Review will allow an agenda to
                 be developed so focused attention can be brought to specific needs or
                 topics. It will allow committee members to review BMT curriculum and
                 other BMT-related statistical data to make informed decisions regarding
                 the validation of existing training materials as well as the inclusion of
                 additional training .

                                       Section B
                                     Analyze Needs


 Introduction      Once needs are identified and communicated by BMT Review
                   committee members or by higher headquarters through an Out of Cycle
                   requirement, a needs analysis is conducted to determine what, if any,
                   training is needed. BMT curriculum developers are responsible for
                   conducting this analysis.



 Needs analysis    Needs analysis is the process of analyzing a need, problem, or deficiency
                   in order to determine if the solution is training or non-training related.
                   This includes refining the need or clarifying whether the need is
                   represented by a task, knowledge, or attitude. If a problem is caused by a
                   lack of skills, knowledge, or attitude to accomplish a job, then the
                   problem is training-related.



 When is a needs   Needs analysis must be done before any other planning occurs or
 analysis          additional resources are committed to a project. A good assessment will
 conducted ?       determine whether the need can be satisfied with training or may require
                   some other solution such as a policy change, new procedures, better
                   working conditions, or others that do not require a training solution.
                   BMT committee members will arrive at the BMT Review with an
                   agenda including any needs that have been identified. Once a need has
                   been identified, it can be further analyzed. Ideally, BMT curriculum
                   developers will assist in guiding a needs analysis during the BMT
                   Review. Committee members should ensure the problem is
                   training-related before they task BMT curriculum developers with
                   planning a training solution.

                   If needs are analyzed stemming from an Out of Cycle requirement, BMT
                   curriculum developers will conduct a needs analysis on their own.

BMT mission        The mission of BMT encompasses core values, an appreciation for
                   teamwork, discipline, a basic understanding of the Air Force, and basic
                   warrior skills. At the heart of this mission is the requirement to train the
                   common skills, knowledge, and attitudes that all airmen must possess
                   regardless of duty assignment or duty station. Within BMT, there is
                   limited training time to devote to these topics. The BMT curriculum and
                   schedule have been carefully developed to focus on the "must know"
                   information required to adequately cover these topics. Any additions to
                   the BMT curriculum must be carefully scrutinized to ensure they support
                   the mission of BMT, are required learning of all airmen, and are in the
                   best interests of the welfare of the individual airmen as well as the
                   overall mission of the Air Force.



Participation in   BMT curriculum developers participate in BMT Reviews by answering
BMT Reviews        questions about curriculum and by providing briefings on curriculum
                   initiatives, changes in programs, and survey results from data collected.
                   BMT curriculum developers play an important role by assisting in data
                   gathering and focusing the efforts of the committee on the "must know"
                   information common to all airmen.



Stages of needs    In general, a needs analysis consists of six stages.

 Stage 1:              In the initial stage of needs analysis, you need to know:
 Define purpose
                         Who is involved, who wants the problem solved, who needs the
                         problem solved, who is causing the problem, etc.
                         Nature of the problem.
                         Where to get the information.



 Questions to ask      BMT curriculum developers should ask questions to gather additional
                       information on why the requirement exists or what brought about the
                       need for the skill or attitude change. This will enable you to tailor the
                       curriculum to target the actual need.

                              Topic of Discussion      Example Questions
                       Philosophical / Doctrinal          What is the nature of the change?
                       Change (attitude, system,          What is the purpose of the change?
                       equipment, uniform, etc.)
                                                          Why is it changing?
                                                          What caused it to change?



 Stage 2:              Next, identify possible sources of data. The following sources can assist

Questions to ask   BMT curriculum developers should ask questions to identify what
                   resources exist that they can tap into for additional information and
                   insight into the subject matter.


                   Topics of Discussion           Example Questions
                   Training                          Is there Air Force doctrine supporting
                                                     the requirement?
                   Subject Matter                    Are there resources/ documentation
                                                     pertaining to the subject matter from
                                                     other services or organizations?



Stage 3:           Collect data through:
Collect data
                     Group meetings
                     Interviews
                     Observations (if possible)
                     Analyses of work samples and related documents



Questions to ask   BMT curriculum developers should ask questions to determine if the
                   performance gap is caused by the airmen's lack of required knowledge,
                   skill, or attitude. The focus of data collection is on determining whether
                   the need can be satisfied through training or some other mechanism
                   (managerial, policy change, etc.)

                                                      Is the need supportive of a knowledge
                                                      or attitude? If so, does the knowledge
                                                      or attitude support a larger task
                                                      performed on the job ?
                                                      Will job degradation occur if the
                                                      subject is not taught ?



 Knowledge,         To collect data regarding whether a need requires training to satisfy it,
 attitudes, tasks   you must understand the differences among knowledge, attitudes, and
                    tasks. A major goal of BMT is to instill the basic core values, discipline,
                    and attitudes inherent in all enlisted members of the Air Force. Some of
                    these goals will be measured by tasks performed on the job, while others
                    will be defined by knowledge or attitudes that must be acquired as part of
                    the job .



 What is a          Knowledge is information required to develop the skills and attitudes for
 knowledge ?        effective accomplishment of a step, task, or job. Knowledge involves
                    storing and recalling information such as names, labels, facts, principles,
                    nomenclature, steps, etc.
AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003                                                                       27



Examples of       Military Studies such as Military Entitlements, Military Citizenship,
knowledge         Staff Referral Agencies, etc., generally consist of knowledge that must
                  be acquired rather than tasks that must be performed. Other examples of
                  knowledge are:

                    Code of conduct
                    Sexually transmitted diseases
                    Human relations
                    Environmental awareness
                    Educational opportunities



What is an        An attitude is a feeling or emotion toward a fact or state. One of the goals
attitude?         of BMT is to instill attitudes among trainees that support the Air Force
                  vision for what is needed to protect ideals, security, and prosperity of our
                  nation. Military Studies such as Ethics and Human Relations seek to
                  impart a pervasive attitude that should be held universally by all airmen.
                  The training of these topics also seeks to impart knowledge regarding
                  Air Force policy and behaviors expected of all airmen. Attitudes must
                  support Air Force philosophy and policies for conduct. An attitude is
                  often what is needed to achieve desired outcomes.



Examples of         Esprit de corps
attitudes           Discipline
                    Military bearing
                    Professionalism



What is a task?   A task is an observable and measurable unit of work activity or operation
                  that forms a significant part of a job. It constitutes a logical and
                  necessary step in performance, and has a logical beginning and end.
                  Most tasks in the Air Force are procedural, consisting of a series of steps
                  performed to produce a specific outcome. For example, Combat Arms
                  Training is defined by tasks performed on the job such as firing a rifle.
28                                                                AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003



 Task criteria       Understanding the criteria for a task will help identify tasks during the
                     needs analysis.

                       A task is a group of related physical or mental activities directed
                       toward a goal.
                       A task, when performed, results in a meaningful product or process .
                       A task has a definite beginning and end.
                       A task involves people interacting with equipment, media, or other
                       items.
                       A task is directly or indirectly observable.
                       A task is measurable.



 Examples of tasks     Perform squadron/dormitory maintenance.
                       Render courtesies.
                       Perform individual drill movements.
                       Meet fitness/weight standards.
                       Perform field protection.
                       Erect TEMPER tent.
                       Construct defensive fighting position.



 Stage 4:            After data collection, analyze the data collected to:
 Analyze data           Determine if the performance gap is caused by the airmen's lack of
                        required skills, knowledge, or attitude.
                        Confirm the accuracy and quality of the data gathered by:
                            Having individuals who provided the information review
                            the data and analysis results.
                            Verifying the results of the analysis. If the problem is not
                            training-related, committee members should notify appropriate
                            personnel to ensure the problem is appropriately addressed via
                            policy change or some other avenue that does not require
                            training.
AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003                                                                     29



Stage 5:           Before making a training recommendation, you must ensure training is
Justify training   justified. In this step, it may be necessary for curriculum developers to
                   review the BMT Course Training Plan and curriculum with committee
                   members to :

                     Determine if existing BMT resources (instructors, support staff,
                     facilities, equipment) can support the training need.
                     Determine what impact the addition of new training will make to the
                     current schedule.



Questions to ask   BMT curriculum developers should guide the discussion of justification
                   of training through the questions they ask. Some of these questions may
                   not be able to be answered at this stage in the ISD process and may,
                   instead, be answered in the Analysis Phase. However, you should try to
                   get answers to as many questions as possible before the tasking is handed
                   down to you to develop training.

                   Question                  Discussion
                   Does every airman         Review the BMT mission statement to see if
                   perform the task or       the task/skill/requirement is supported by the
                   need to possess the       mission statement. The BMT environment is
                   knowledge or attitude?    unique in that training must support the
                                             acquisition of knowledge, skills, and attitudes
                                             that all airmen must possess to perform their
                                             jobs, regardless of Air Force Specialty Code
                                             (AFSC). For example, it is a requirement that
                                             every airman know the Air Force policy on
                                             sexual harassment. If the gap between actual
                                             and desired performance is something that
                                             must be introduced and reinforced at an entry
                                             level, it may be an appropriate candidate for
                                             BMT.

                          Receive Training Development Tasking


Introduction           As a BMT curriculum developer, you are responsible for developing and
                       maintaining BMT curriculum. The ISD process starts with a training
                       need; it comes to you in the form of a formal request to develop or revise
                       training. Your tasking for curriculum development or revision comes
                       from the BMT Review or an Out of Cycle requirement from higher
                       headquarters. In addition, a revision to training materials may be
                       initiated by a BMT curriculum developer as a result of operational
                       evaluation.



What is a tasking?     A tasking is any formal request to develop new training or revise
                       existing training.



Sources of tasking     The tasking to develop training may come from any number of sources.
                       Examples are:

                          Plan Strategies and Resources


Introduction     Once it has been determined that training is needed, strategies must be
                 planned and resources must be identified for developing and
                 implementing the training. This may be early in the ISD process to nail
                 down all of your resources, but you should start now. This effort will
                 differ greatly if the requirement is to develop new training or it is to
                 revise existing training.



What are         Strategies are required to determine how both training development and
strategies?      training implementation will occur. Strategies provide the "roadmap"
                 for training development and implementation as well as the management
                 of these two efforts. Strategies will differ if the effort is one of
                 development or revision. For example, if training materials will be
                 added, it is necessary to determine where the new training will be taught
                 within the existing course schedule. Strategies identify and document:

                   What must be done and the resources required to do it.
                   Who is responsible for doing it.
                   How it is going to be done.
                   When it needs to be completed.



What are         The most critical element in ISD is resources. Throughout the entire
resources?       ISD process, resources will always be your major concern. In the
                 planning stages of ISD, your responsibility is to identify the resource
                 requirements to revise, design, develop, implement, and continue to
                 maintain a training program. Resources include:

                   Personnel Resources – curriculum developers, instructors
                   Information Resources - publications, regulations, existing
                   curriculum
                   Time – development time, course time
                   Equipment – training, support
                   Facilities – classroom, drill pad, range, field setting
36                                                        AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003



 Purpose of    The purpose of identifying resources early in the ISD process is to
 identifying   ensure you have the resources you need in place at every phase as you
 resources     progress through the ISD process. You cannot do a good job unless you
               have the necessary resources at the right time. Some resources may
               require a long lead-time to secure them so it is important to start
               planning early. For example, personnel needed must have sufficient time
               to schedule their work on the project.



 Personnel     At this point in the Planning Phase, you must consider how many of the
 resources     following people you need to support development of the materials as
               well as implementation:

                 Curriculum developers
                 Subject matter experts (SME)
                 Instructors
                 Support personnel

                 Sample Questions for Identifying Personnel Resources
                 How many curriculum developers will be needed?

                 Are SMEs required? If so, how many and for what period of time?

                 What type and how many people will be needed for support activities?

                 Will other organizations be needed to develop the training materials ?

                 How many instructors will be required?

                 Are there any personnel constraints? If so, what are they?
AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003                                                                          37



Personnel              The scope and level of the ISD project will determine personnel
resources - scope      requirements. For example:
and level of project
                         Developing new training from scratch will normally require more
                         curriculum developers than revising training in the BMT curriculum .

                         Developing or revising training supporting a specific subject matter
                         may require SMEs to provide technical expertise on the subject matter.
                         It is possible that other agencies [e.g., Legal, Military Equal
                         Opportunity (MEO), Public Health, Readiness, Medical] will develop
                         the training materials. You must coordinate the effort with them to
                         ensure you get the materials needed to support implementation of the
                         training.

                         Developing a course using interactive courseware (ICW) will require
                         more personnel using different skills, such as programmers and
                         graphic artists, than are required for print-based materials. Levels of
                         complexity within ICW will impact personnel requirements since the
                         more complex the material, the more time it takes to design and
                         develop.



Information            It is important to identify sources of information for developing or
resources              revising curriculum. Sources include:

                         Mission requirements
                         Directives
                         System specifications
                         Technical data
                         Legal, MEO, Public Health, Readiness, Medical
                         Existing materials from other services or government agencies



Additional             There are additional resources, including equipment, facilities, time, and
resources              funding, that you must consider. For example, in planning the
                       development effort, you must consider how many computers you will
                       need. In planning implementation, you must consider what equipment
                       will be needed to support training.

 Resource       You will seldom have all the resources you need or would like to have to
 constraints    develop and implement training. Therefore, you will probably be
                working under some kind of resource constraint.

 Introduction       Before entering the ISD process, make sure adequate planning and
                    preparation have been accomplished. If the needs analysis conducted in
                    the Planning Phase confirmed a training need, you will usually begin
                    instructional development at the Analysis Phase. However, in some
                    cases, such as the revision to existing BMT curriculum, you may be able
                    to enter directly into the Design or Development Phases of ISD. This
                    chapter of the handbook will address the tasks you perform in the
                    Analysis Phase of ISD with an emphasis on the steps required to create
                    new training materials rather than revise existing materials.

Determine type of   The nature and scope of each ISD project will be determined by the
analysis            assessed training deficiency/requirement established by operational
                    forces or higher headquarters element.



Focus of BMT        To determine the type of analysis to perform, you must first understand
                    the focus of BMT. The primary focus of BMT is to transform civilian
                    recruits into airmen warriors whose behavior is consistent with the
                    standards, values, and beliefs of the Air Force. To accomplish these
                    objectives, tasks, knowledge, and attitudes must be trained and instilled
                    during BMT. To do this, BMT:

                      Provides the foundation for understanding and internalizing Air Force
                      core values.

                      Instills an appreciation for teamwork and working with people from
                      diverse walks of life.

                      Instills a sense of discipline so that trainees follow orders and do what
                      is expected of them when unsupervised.

                      Provides a basic understanding of the Air Force and its history,
                      structure, and customs.

                      Instills the importance of meeting Air Force fitness, weight, and image
                      standards.

                      Prepares airmen for war through a series of lectures and practical
                      exercises in job-realistic environments.



Job analysis        In the Analysis Phase of ISD, a job analysis is most commonly
                    conducted. Jobs are analyzed to determine what tasks are performed on
                    the job. All trainees entering the Air Force at the enlisted level attend
                    BMT. As such, the target audience for BMT is not composed of a single
                    job, but of any and all jobs enlisted Air Force personnel may hold.
                    Therefore, a job analysis is not the purview of BMT curriculum
                    developers.

 Educational     If a need was identified during the Planning Phase that did not support a
 analysis        task and, instead, supported a knowledge or attitude, you will begin in
                 the Analysis Phase using a process called educational analysis (see
                 Figure 4). An educational analysis is the process of reviewing
                 educational requirements and developing educational goals.



 Task analysis   If a task was identified as a deficiency in job performance in the needs
                 analysis conducted in the Planning Phase of ISD, you will begin in the
                 Analysis Phase using a process called task analysis (see Figure 4). Task
                 analysis is the process of breaking down tasks into subtasks (perfor-
                 mance steps), conditions, and standards .

                         Conduct Educational Analysis


Introduction     BMT curriculum developers are responsible for analyzing the common
                 skills, knowledge, and attitudes that all airmen must possess to function
                 as an enlisted member of the Air Force. These were identified in the
                 needs analysis conducted in the Planning stage. BMT instills the basic
                 core values, discipline, and attitudes inherent in all members of the Air
                 Force. These goals are supported by tasks performed on the job as well
                 as knowledge and attitudes that must be acquired as part of the job. The
                 knowledge and attitudes are the focus of educational analysis.
                 Educational analysis is the process of reviewing educational
                 requirements and developing educational goals.



When is          During a BMT Review or as a result of an Out of Cycle requirement,
educational      educational goals may have been articulated in your tasking such as a

                 abuse. In the process of needs analysis, you may have further broken
                 down those goals into definable knowledge and attitudes so that a
                 determination could be made as to whether training was required. If that
                 was done, the bulk of your work is done and you may continue with
                 learning analysis (see Section C).

                 If a needs analysis was not conducted, it will be necessary to start with
                 educational analysis to break down educational requirements into goals
                 defined by knowledge and attitudes.

 How to conduct an   The process of conducting an educational analysis involves a number of
 educational         steps. The actual number may depend on the type and scope of the
 analysis            analysis being conducted. Normally you should do the following:

                       Review tasking. Review the tasking from the BMT Review or Out of
                       Cycle requirement to determine the scope of the training need and the
                       subject matter. Tasking may also be in the form of an identified
                       requirement as a result of course evaluation.

                       Collect data. Data may be collected using several methods such as:
                         Review of doctrine, publications, or other materials provided by
                         personnel responsible for tasking .
                         Interviews with experts.
                         Review of other organization's or other services' documentation on
                         same or similar subjects .
                         System comparisons (new system to existing similar system) .
                         Observations.

                       Identify knowledge and attitudes. Analyze the data to
                       identify the goals of the training to include the broad knowledge and
                       attitudes that must be acquired to support the goal.

                       Document results. The results of your analysis should be a listing of :

                              Conduct Task Analysis


Introduction     If tasks are identified as part of the needs analysis, they must be further
                 analyzed to determine performance requirements such as the conditions
                 under which they are performed and the performance standard that must
                 be achieved. If you are revising curriculum, the effort may not require
                 another task analysis.


What is task
analysis ?       Task analysis is the process of breaking a task down and identifying :

                   Subtasks (also called performance steps) of a task and the sequence
                   of those steps.
                   Conditions or limits under which the task will be performed such as
                   what tools, equipment, materials or information will be needed to
                   perform the task.
                   Standard of performance that must be achieved.



Why is task      Breaking tasks down by subtasks (performance steps), conditions, and
analysis         standards provides a focus for training. It further enables a better
necessary ?      understanding of the task that will assist curriculum developers when
                 developing the learning objectives and curriculum supportive of a task .
48                                                              AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003



 Writing a task   In needs analysis, you extracted the tasks performed by all airmen from
 statement        the identified training need. In task analysis, you will further analyze and
                  break down those tasks. To do this, you must ensure you have correctly
                  written task statements. A task describes what the job holder must do on
                  the job. An important distinction to make is that a task should not
                  describe what the job holder does during training.


                                              General Guidance
                  1. Begin with a present-tense action verb followed by an object
                  indicating the action to be performed:
                  Example: Clean squadron.
                  Write separate, specific statements for each task. Avoid combining
                  vague items of skill, knowledge, or responsibility such as :
                  Has responsibility for cleaning squadron.


                  2. Relate the task to the job, not the instructional environment.
                  Example: Manage a budget.

                  Not
                  Attend lecture on financial management.

 What is a subtask?   Subtasks, or performance steps, specify the actions required to
                      accomplish a task. They are groupings of work activities that, when
                      combined, make up a task. They may also be defined as a series of
                      actions leading to a terminal outcome. Subtasks may follow a logical
                      progression that should be performed sequentially, or they may be
                      independent of one another. Not all tasks will warrant subtasks.



 Reasons for          There are several reasons for identifying subtasks. Breaking a task into
 identifying          subtasks:
 subtasks
                        Provides curriculum developers with a better understanding of the
                        task and what is required to perform the task.
                        Ensures trainees are provided with the detailed knowledge and skills
                        required to perform the larger task.
                        Helps curriculum developers sequence the training.
                        Helps curriculum developers analyze complex tasks.



 Writing a subtask    Examine each task statement. See if it contains more than one group of
                      activities that must be performed sequentially or independently. List all
                      subtasks supportive of a task. Review the complete list of subtasks for
                      each task. Make sure that no subtask overlaps, and that together they
                      account for all performance required in the task.

 Data collection   As a curriculum developer, your first step in task analysis will be to
                   collect the necessary data for analysis. As you begin to collect the data,
                   you will find there are many sources.



 Data sources      Some of the data sources are:

                     AF regulations and manuals
                     Training documentation
                     SME input
                     Technical orders
                     Standard Operating Procedures
                     Major Command (MAJCOM) input

 Validate task      Now that you have analyzed the data and determined the tasks required
 information        of all airmen and the subtasks involved in each task, your next step is to
                    verify the information. For each ISD effort, the data collected and the
                    results of the data analysis need to be verified. You can verify your data
                    through:

                      Interviews with SMEs.
                      Review of technical documentation related to subject matter.
                      Observation of task performance.



 Document task      You may use a variety of formats to document task analysis results. A
 analysis results   simple way is to use a Task Analysis Worksheet like the one shown on
                    the next page. Regardless of the format that you choose, you should
                    document the information you need to develop the objectives in the next
                    phase of the ISD process (see Chapter 5, Section A).

                                Conduct Learning Analysis


 Introduction        Now that the tasks to be trained have been determined, you need to
                     conduct a learning analysis. As discussed in educational analysis, not all
                     ISD instruction is based on tasks and task analysis. In Air Force
                     educational courses, the translation of educational goals into measurable
                     behaviors does not always involve traditional task analysis and, instead,
                     sample behaviors are derived from analysis of the type and level of
                     learning required and the knowledge content of the subject area. This is
                     done through learning analysis. A learning analysis is conducted on the
                     tasks as well as knowledge and attitudes identified for training.
                     Conducting a learning analysis will aid you immeasurably when
                     designing training. Results of the learning analysis enable you to design
                     training based on desired learning outcomes.



 What is learning    Learning analysis is the process of analyzing the real-world tasks
 analysis?           performed on the job and translating them into behaviors performed in
                     the training environment. Learning analysis involves establishing
                     learning outcomes in terms of types of learning involved and level of
                     learning desired.



 Learning analysis   Tasks. Learning analysis allows you to determine the best way to
 steps               structure training to ensure that it is effective and cost-efficient. When
                     you conduct a learning analysis, you should:

                       Identify the skills and knowledge needed to support task performance.
                       Combine skills and knowledge into meaningful groupings.
                       Identify the types of learning involved and determine level of
                       learning.

                     Knowledge and attitudes. The learning analysis should differ
                     depending on whether the training is performance-oriented (supported
                     by tasks) or knowledge-oriented (supported by knowledge and
                     attitudes). In the latter case, rather than listing the skills and knowledge
                     needed to support task performance, the curriculum developer looks
                     directly at categorizing type and level of learning needed to satisfy the
                     instructional goal.

Step 1 - Identify   For every task or subtask of a task, generate a list of knowledge and
skills and          skills supportive of it.
knowledge
                    For example, a task is 'Perform basic first aid'. Two related subtasks are
                    'Treat a hemorrhage' and 'Treat a wound'. The knowledge and skills
                    associated with the subtasks include the following :


                               Knowledge                                 Skills
                    Treat a hemorrhage:                   Treat a hemorrhage:
                    Knowledge of triage                   Ability to group victims
                    Knowledge of triage categories         according to injury
                    Knowledge of first aid materials      Ability to assess casualty
                    Knowledge of casualty                 Ability to treat internal
                      assessment procedures                hemorrhage
                    Knowledge of types of                 Ability to treat external
                      hemorrhages                          hemorrhage
                    Knowledge of procedures for
                      treating hemorrhages

                    Treat a wound:                        Treat a wound:
                    Knowledge of triage                   Ability to group victims
                    Knowledge of triage categories         according to injury
                    Knowledge of first aid materials      Ability to assess casualty
                    Knowledge of casualty                 Ability to treat head wound
                      assessment procedures               Ability to treat neck wound Ability
                    Knowledge of types of wounds          to treat sucking chest
                    Knowledge of procedures for            wound
                      treating wounds


                    For any knowledge or attitudes not supported by a task, you may break
                    them down further by identifying additional knowledge required. For
                    example, 'Knowledge of first aid materials', may generate a list of
                    supporting knowledge including:

                    Knowledge of abdominal dressing
                    Knowledge of field dressing
                    Knowledge of cravat
                    Knowledge of improvised materials
                    Knowledge of occlusive dressing
58                                                               AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003




 Step 2 - Combine   Next, combine knowledge and skills which are duplicates, very similar,
 skills and         or common to more than one task or subtask. Eliminating duplicates
 knowledge          ensures the same knowledge or skill is not taught more than once during
                    a training program. These groupings of knowledge and skills become the
                    root behaviors of learning objectives (see Chapter 5, Section A). The
                    common groupings of the knowledge and skills for 'Treat a hemorrhage'
                    and 'Treat a wound' are:


                                Common Groupings of Knowledge and Skills



                    Knowledge of triage
                    Knowledge of triage categories
                    Ability to group victims according to injury

                    Knowledge of first aid materials

                    Knowledge of casualty assessment procedures
                    Ability to assess casualty

                    Knowledge of types of hemorrhages
                    Knowledge of procedures for treating hemorrhages
                    Ability to treat internal hemorrhage
                    Ability to treat external hemorrhage

                    Knowledge of types of wounds
                    Knowledge of procedures for treating wounds
                    Ability to treat head wound
                    Ability to treat neck wound
                    Ability to treat sucking chest wound

                    (Note that the redundant knowledge and skills for triage, first aid, and
                    casualty assessment were only listed once; duplicates were deleted.)

Step 3 – Identify   Categorize knowledge and skills according to types of learning and
types/level of      level of learning, or level of proficiency desired. Types of learning
learning            include:

                      Verbal information
                      Intellectual skills
                      Motor skills
                      Attitudes



                    Verbal           Verbal information is required to develop the skills and
                    information      attitudes for effective accomplishment of a step or task.
                                     The learning of knowledge is imparted through verbal
                                     information. Verbal information involves storing and
                                     recalling information and refers to the learning and
                                     recall of names, labels, facts, nomenclature, etc. The
                                     learning outcome of imparting verbal information is the
                                     acquisition of knowledge .

                      Learning Outcome                             Behavior
                    Knowledge                    Able to recall, label, name, and define.



                    Skills           A skill is the ability to perform a job-related activity
                                     that contributes to the effective accomplishment of a
                                     step or job. There are two types of skills:

                                       Intellectual skills
                                       Motor skills
60                                                               AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003




 Step 3 – Identify   Intellectual     Intellectual skills are the foundation for all higher
 types/level of      skills           learning. Intellectual skills involve identifying,
 learning                             classifying, categorizing, using rules, solving problems,
 (Continued )                         thinking, reasoning, analyzing, discriminating,
                                      evaluating, and judging. To learn a higher-order skill, the
                                      trainee must first acquire knowledge provided by verbal
                                      information. The learning outcomes of acquiring

                                Revise Course Training Standard

 Developing course        Once the tasks, knowledge, and attitudes to be taught in the course have
 training standards       been selected and documented, the training standard for the course
                          should be developed. The course training standard (CTS) indicates the
                          learning outcome and level of learning required for each standard. A
                          Proficiency Code Key explains these relationships. Subject knowledge
                          level supports knowledge objectives as well as the knowledge
                          components of performance objectives (see Chapter 5, Section A). Task

                Analyze Resource Requirements/Constraints


 Introduction   Resources are critical at every step from the initial planning, through
                training development, to implementation and maintenance of a training
                program. During the Analysis Phase, you probably will not be able to
                determine exact resource requirements. However, you need to identify
                long-lead-time resource requirements such as training equipment and
                facilities in order to allow sufficient time to secure the needed resources
                or to work out alternatives in case of resource constraints.



 What are       Training resources are the supplies and support required to revise,
 resources?     design, develop, implement, and maintain a training program.
                Resources for a training program fall into one of several categories:

                  Equipment
                  Facilities
                  Funds
                  Personnel
                  Time


 Why analyze    Resource analysis allows you to identify and estimate the resources
 resources?     required to design, develop, implement, and maintain a training
                program. Resource analysis identifies:

                  Course development resources.
                  Quantity of resources required such as number of instructors,
                  classrooms, equipment, etc.
                  When the resources are needed.
                  Total cost of resources.
                  Resource limits.



 Who is         Managers have the overall responsibility to ensure availability of
 responsible?   adequate resources, but curriculum developers will provide input on
                necessary resources to support training.

Before analyzing   Before you begin analyzing resource requirements, keep the following
resource           things in mind .
requirements


                   Equipment      Failure to identify training equipment requirements early
                                  may delay training implementation.
                                  Do not order or procure equipment until course
                                  objectives have been tentatively set to make sure there is
                                  a valid requirement for the equipment.
                                  When selecting equipment, consider:
                                     Suitability or appropriateness
                                     Usability
                                     Reliability

                                     Cost



                   Facilities     Identify facility requirements as early as possible
                                  because:
                                    Time required to get funds is normally long.
                                    Time to build new facilities or modify existing
                                    facilities can be considerable .



                   Funds          Budgets are normally submitted and approved long
                                  before money is actually spent. Therefore, managers
                                  and curriculum developers must determine as precisely
                                  as possible what resources will be required to support the
                                  training program.

                                    You must provide input to the budget to get funds
                                    appropriated to allow for:
                                      Procurement of equipment.
                                      Construction or modification of facilities.
                                      Personnel costs such as payroll.

Introduction       During the Design Phase, you will build the framework from which
                   training is developed including the development of learning objectives
                   and tests and the selection of media. What you do here plays a key role
                   in determining the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the training you
                   will develop in the next phase of the ISD process.

                               Components of Objectives



Introduction     A learning objective is made up of three components: A behavior,
                 conditions, and a standard. Before starting to develop objectives, you
                 should become thoroughly familiar with each component.



Behavior         A behavior is the activity the trainee is expected to demonstrate
                 following training. A behavior must be written in measurable,
                 observable terms so trainee performance can be objectively evaluated. A
                 behavior must be clearly stated so that everyone – trainees, instructors,
                 and developers – knows exactly what the trainee is expected to do in the
                 training environment.



Performance vs   Trained behaviors may be performance-based or knowledge-based. A
knowledge        performance objective is the term used to describe a performance-based
behavior s       behavior; a knowledge objective is the term used to describe a
                 knowledge-based behavior. When writing a behavior, you must consider
                 whether the behavior will support knowledge or performance. What will
                 the trainee be required to do at the end of training?


                   If the trainee will be required to perform a task or some action, the
                   learning outcome is a performance behavior.


                   If the trainee will be required to answer a written test question, the
                   learning outcome is a knowledge behavior.



Verb selection   Select a verb that supports the action required of the trainee. Use action
                 verbs to reduce ambiguity. Action verbs are observable and measurable
                 while ambiguous verbs are not. The following table provides some
                 examples.

 Available resources   Resources available in the training environment may also affect whether
                       you are able to develop a performance or knowledge objective.

Conditions       A condition identifies the situation under which a trainee is expected to
                 demonstrate a behavior. A properly prepared objective clearly states the
                 limits or conditions of trainee performance.

                     Any information or resource (e.g., technical orders, tools, equipment,
                     notes) that is provided to the trainee to perform the behavior is con-
                     sidered an aiding condition .

                     Any information or resource that is not made available to the trainee
                     is considered a limiting condition.

                     The environment (e.g., weather, location, time of day, facilities) in
                     which the trainee must perform the behavior is considered an envi-
                     ronmental condition.

 Mimicking job   Whenever possible, the condition should be the same as the actual
 behavior        conditions under which the job is performed. In this way, training will
                 directly support job performance. There are two instances in which
                 conditions may not replicate job conditions:


                   The task must be simulated in the training environment because
                   performance could be hazardous or impossible to reproduce in a
                   training setting.


                    The task can only be partially trained in the training environment due
                   to lack of resources (e.g., equipment, facilities, training time). In these
                    cases, an orientation may be provided on the subject matter, rather
                    than a detailed lesson with practical application.

Standard             A standard defines the criteria for acceptable performance by the trainee.
                     It is stated in terms such as completeness, accuracy, time constraints, and
                     performance rates. It identifies the proficiency trainees must achieve
                     when they perform the behavior under the specified conditions. Without
                     a standard, it is impossible to determine when the trainees have achieved
                     the objective .



Types of standards   Standards can be classified in one of the following types.

                               Guidelines for Developing Objectives



 Introduction          You will develop objectives from the data you collected through the
                       learning analysis in the Analysis Phase. Using learning analysis
                       information, what you have learned about objectives to this point, and a
                       few guidelines, you will be able to develop effective objectives.



 Example objective     An example objective follows.

 Types of objectives   Most tasks are made up of steps and procedures (subtasks). Trainees
                       need to learn each of these subtasks before they can perform a particular
                       task. To facilitate learning, you need to specify objectives for those
                       subtasks, in addition to the task itself. This hierarchy of objectives will
                       allow the most effective and efficient learning sequence to be developed.
                       There are two types of objectives :

                                        accomplish when they have completed the instruction.
                                        It may be supported by several enabling objectives.

                                        accomplish a terminal objective. Enabling objectives
                                        provide the level of detail necessary to describe the
                                        knowledge and skills that must be learned to
                                        demonstrate satisfactory performance of the terminal
                                        objective.

 Step 1: Develop a     Start with the task behavior identified in the Analysis Phase. Develop a
 terminal objective    terminal objective that translates the task from the real-world
                       environment to the training environment. Revise conditions and
                       standards as necessary to reflect the learning environment.



 Step 2: Develop         For every grouping of knowledge and skills identified in the learning
 enabling objectives     analysis, develop an enabling objective reflecting the conditions and
                         standards required in the learning environment.

                      Whenever possible, develop performance objectives over knowledge
                      objectives. This ensures training more closely replicates job
                      performance. If, however, training resources do not allow performance,
                      it will be necessary to develop a knowledge objective.

                      Some groupings will only reflect verbal information and, as such, will
                      translate to a knowledge objective such as 'Identify first aid materials'.

                      Develop all enabling objectives supporting a terminal objective before
                      moving on to the next terminal objective.

                        Grouping and Sequencing Objectives



Introduction     The effectiveness and cost-efficiency of a course will depend in part on
                 how well you cluster and sequence objectives.



Grouping         The purpose of grouping objectives is to develop logical and meaningful
objectives       portions of training such as topics, units, or lessons.

                   Group terminal objectives that deal with the same subject together.
                   For example, all objectives dealing with dorm guard or dorm
                   maintenance may be grouped together.

                   Group terminal objectives with the same conditions (e.g., in a field
                   environment, using an M-16 rifle) together. Grouping by condition
                   maximizes instructional time because time is not lost due to traveling
                   from one location to another. Time is also not lost obtaining the same
                   equipment at different times throughout training.



Sequencing of    The goal of good instructional design is to establish a sequence of
objectives       instruction within a course that promotes effective learning. The
                 sequence of lessons within a course should be based on the relationship
                 among the objectives. The most obvious sequence follows the order
                 from simple to complex. Place easily learned objectives early in the
                 training sequence; place complex and cumulative skills late in the
                 sequence. The following table summarizes the major considerations
                 regarding sequential arrangement of objectives .

 Relationship
 Among                                        Description
 Objectives
 Dependent      In a dependent relationship, skills and knowledge in one objective are
                related to those in another such that mastery of one objective requires
                prior mastery of another. Sequence objectives so supporting knowledge
                and skills are acquired before dependent subject matter is introduced.
                For example, serving as dorm guard is dependent upon reporting
                procedures. A trainee must learn reporting procedures before he can
                function as a dorm guard. Provide any common or "core" training early
                in the training sequence that is supportive of multiple objectives.


                A dependent relationship can also relate to learning outcome. For
                example, the learning of verbal information is generally prerequisite to
                the learning of intellectual skills and motor skills. Objectives should be
                sequenced so that verbal information supportive of intellectual skills and
                motor skills is taught before these skills.
 Sequential     In a sequential relationship, objectives have a relationship among them
                that correlates to the order in which they occur on the job. For example,
                preventive maintenance of an M-16 rifle must be performed in sequence
                of disassembly, cleaning, inspection, lubrication, and reassembly.
                Supportive learning objectives should be sequenced in this fashion.
 Independent    Objectives that are independent of one another may be sequenced in any
                order. For example, a terminal objective of “Identify basic facts about
                Air Force rank recognition” may be supported by the enabling objectives
                of “Identify enlisted rank insignias” and “Identify officer rank
                insignias.” These enabling objectives are independent of one another and
                may be sequenced in any order.

                   Trainee motivation – Trainees learn best when they are motivated to
                   do so. In most cases, motivation depends on a proper sense of
                   direction. Properly sequenced training will provide this direction and
                   will give trainees a "mental roadmap" of where they are going and
                   how they are going to get there.
                   Meaningful relationship – A proper sequence can provide trainees
                   with a pattern of relationships so that each training activity will have a
                   purpose. If the training is meaningful to the trainees, they will learn
                   more easily and quickly.
                   Consistency in content – Proper sequencing helps to avoid
                   inconsistencies in the training content. Carefully sequenced training
                   will eliminate gaps and duplication in the training. Consistency of
                   content ensures that skill progression is orderly and that prerequisite
                   knowledge and skill have been acquired prior to the introduction of
                   more complex information .
                   Normally, training activities should be sequenced to proceed from
                   simple to complex. Trainees are taught the easier tasks first, then
                   progress to the more complex tasks.

                                          Develop Tests


 Introduction         As part of designing instruction, tests must be developed. Testing is
                      critical to maintaining or improving the effectiveness of instruction by
                      determining if learning objectives have been met. A test is used to
                      evaluate training by measuring proficiency against established
                      standards. Test items are written after objectives have been written to
                      ensure test items are closely related to objectives.
 Criterion-           Air Force tests are based on the concept of criterion-referenced testing.
 referenced testing   Criterion-referenced tests measure knowledge objectives, knowledge
                      components of performance objectives, and performance objectives in
                      sufficient quantity to provide an acceptable degree of confidence that the
                      trainees have attained the required knowledge and skills. To ensure tests
                      adequately measure objectives, the performance required in the test
                      should match the performance required in the objective.
 Assessment method    Most Air Force tests can be classified into two main groups:
                      performance tests and written tests.
 Performance test     A performance test is one in which the trainee actually performs the skill
                      required of the objective. The most content-valid test of any kind of
                      learning is a performance test because the trainee actually performs what
                      is required on the job. Within BMT, performance tests are conducted for
                      reporting procedures, individual drill, physical conditioning, and
                      dormitory performance.

                        A performance test often duplicates job behaviors by using the same
                        resources, equipment, setting, or circumstance that the trainee will
                        encounter on the job.

                        If a performance test cannot duplicate the job, it should simulate job
                        conditions as closely as possible to provide a realistic setting in which
                        to evaluate the skills required for job performance.

Performance test   A performance test is used to evaluate a performance objective. A
(Continued)        performance test measures both motor skills and intellectual skills.

                   Motor skills          Motor skills are most commonly tested via
                                         performance test. If the objective is to perform
                                         entry and exit procedures, then the trainee will
                                         actually be tested on his ability to perform these
                                         procedures correctly.
                   Intellectual skills   Intellectual skills may also be tested via
                                         performance test. If the objective is to process
                                         information in order to make a decision, then a
                                         test where the trainee has to read a scenario or a
                                         problem and state or record a decision is also
                                         considered a performance test. This is only true if
                                         the action, such as processing information to
                                         make a decision, is the same action as that
                                         performed on the job.



Written test       A written test is one in which a trainee's knowledge of a subject is
                   evaluated. The BMT Academic Test is given to trainees in the fourth
                   week of training prior to departure to Warrior Week. A written test is
                   used to evaluate a knowledge objective. A written test measures verbal
                   information and intellectual skills. There are several cases when you
                   should choose to design written tests.

                           Guidelines for Designing Written Tests



 Types of written   The most common types of written test questions are multiple-choice,
 test questions     true/false, matching, labeling, fill-in-the-blank, and essay.
                    These types of test items may be used to evaluate trainee knowledge
                    following training. They may also be used to provide Progress Checks at
                    different points throughout training or to intersperse self-checks
                    throughout Trainee Workbooks or other trainee materials.



 Multiple-choice    Multiple-choice test items are probably the most common type of item
                    used in written tests. They test recall, problem-solving skills, application
                    of facts and principles, and understanding. A multiple choice item
                    consists of:

                      A stem (a question or uncompleted statement)
                      A correct response
                      Distracters (incorrect responses)


                    Example

                    Directions: Carefully read the questions or statements below and circle
                    the correct response. There is only one correct response.

                    1. Prejudice can be defined as:

                      a. evaluations based on merit.
                      b. credit given for capabilities.
                      c. rewards based on performance.
                      d. prejudgment without knowledge.
AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003                                                                    91



Multiple-choice   Development Guidelines
(Continued)         All responses should follow grammatically from the stem.
                    All responses should be of approximately the same length.
                    All responses should have a similar grammatical structure.
                    All responses should use similar terminology.
                    Provide as many responses as necessary but normally four.
                    Position the correct response randomly throughout the test.
                    Limit the use of responses such as "none of the above" or "all of the
                    above."
                    Ensure there is only one correct answer.
                    Ensure distracters are plausible, but incorrect.



True/False        A true/false test should be used sparingly since the chance of getting
                  the answer correct through random guessing is high. True/false tests
                  may be used when you want a trainee to identify a completely true or
                  completely false statement.


                  Example

                  Directions: Carefully read the question below and circle True or False to
                  indicate the correct response.

                  True False 1. The Air Force has a zero tolerance policy for sexual
                  harassment.

                  True False 2. An officer borrowing money from an enlisted airman is an
                  example of fraternization.



                  Development Guidelines
                    Include only one idea in each statement.
                    Avoid using negatives such as "no" or "not."
                    Do not use absolutes such as "all," "every," "none," and "never."
                    Do not use statements containing "some," "any," and "generally."

 Matching            A matching test is used to measure a trainee's ability to identify and
                     discriminate among related or similar items. Matching items normally
                     consist of two columns of related items, requiring trainees to match a
                     series of items listed in one column with related items in the other
                     column. It provides a way to test multiple knowledge simultaneously.


                     Example


                     Directions: Match the description in the right-hand column with the type
                     of casualty it defines in the left-hand column by placing the identifying
                     letter in the blank space provided.

                      Avoid grammatical cues to the correct answer, such as the articles "a"
                      and "an" just before the blank.
                      Ensure only one correct answer is possible for each blank.

 Labeling   Labeling or identification tests are used to measure a trainee's ability to
            recall and label parts in pictures, schematics, diagrams, or drawings.
            This form of testing is most often used to measure recognition of
            equipment components or other concrete objects.



            Example


            Directions: Identify the parts of the rifle. Record the correct answers in
            the spaces provided.




            Development Guidelines
              Ensure all sketches, drawings, illustrations, or photos are clear and
              readable.
              Provide sufficient information to indicate what the equipment is and
              which part is to be labeled.
              Clearly point out the parts to be labeled or identified by using lines or
              arrows.
              Ensure only one correct answer is possible for each.



 Essay      An essay test requires a written discussion by the trainee. It should be
            used only when the trainees are expected to think reflectively or
            creatively, to organize knowledge in the solution of a problem, and to
            express their solution in writing.

Essay (Continued)   Example

                    Directions: Complete the essay question in 500 words or less. Use only
                    one side of the paper to write your response.

                    Test Item: Describe how the Air Force's policy on human relations
                    relates to the Air Force core values.



                    Development Guidelines
                      State the essay item clearly so the trainee knows exactly what type of
                      discussion is expected.
                      The essay item should ask for comparisons, decisions, solutions,
                      cause-effect relationships, explanations or summary.
                      Set limits on essay questions such as time or number of words.



Test construction   Match learning objective. A test is the primary means of determining if
factors             trainees have mastered the objectives. A test is not intended to deceive
                    trainees by testing knowledge and skills not taught in training and not
                    reflected in the objective. Therefore, a valid test item must be written to
                    reflect the behavior in the objective. The level of testing should correlate
                    with the stated level of learning for that portion of the instruction being
                    tested – no higher and no lower. One or more test items may be needed to
                    adequately measure each objective.

                    Test length. Adequate coverage of the objective is the major factor in
                    determining the length of test that is required. The difficulty, complexity,
                    and scope of behavior in the objective will determine how many test
                    items are required to support an objective. Longer tests are normally
                    more reliable since they usually cover the material better .
96                                                                 AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003



 Test construction     Selection and arrangement of test items. Select test items that cover
 factors (Continued)   the most essential and significant portions of the material. Test items
                       selected should be clear, concise and well written to minimize
                       misunderstandings. Items of the same type should be grouped together
                       in a test, if possible. Individual test items should also be arranged in
                       approximate order of difficulty, which allows the trainees to progress as
                       far as they can without spending excessive time on difficult items at the
                       first part of the test.

                       Administrative instructions. Ensure administrative instructions for the
                       test are developed. Include the following:

                         Detailed instructions on any resources or verbal information the
                         evaluator should provide trainees prior to starting the test.

                         Detailed instructions on the procedures for administering the test and
                         collecting it when trainees finish or the test period ends.

                         Detailed instructions directed toward the trainee for completing the
                         test.

                                           Steps To Develop Written Tests
                          Step 1      Determine the test format and the number of items per
                                      objective.
                          Step 2      Generate enough test items for at least two versions of the
                                      test. More than one version of a written test must be
                                      maintained -- one primary version and at least one
                                      version for retesting trainees who fail.
                          Step 3      Arrange test items (logical, simple-to-complex, and
                                      procedural).
                          Step 4      Write directions for test administration.
                          Step 5      Review the test for accuracy and completeness.

                         Guidelines for Designing Performance Tests



 Constructing        Performance tests, which require the trainee to perform a task, usually
 performance test/   have the format of a checklist. The checklist is developed to correspond to
 checklist           the steps or activities of the task being performed. It should contain
                     observable and measurable activities that can be objectively evaluated.
                     Performance tests are generally rated on a pass/fail basis. During the
                     performance test, an evaluator observes the trainee performing a series of
                     steps or activities while rating the steps on a checklist (process evaluation).
                     An evaluator may also rate the end product of performance on a checklist
                     (product evaluation).



 Performance test    When a performance test requires the steps or activities to be rated, a
 using a process     process checklist is used. The process checklist should contain all of the
 checklist           essential steps or activities required for successful performance.

                     Example
                                           REPORTING PROCEDURES
                     Check                  Step or Activity                 Description of Error
                                1. Demonstrates military bearing.
                                2. Demonstrates self-discipline.
                                3. Takes most direct route in/out.
                                4. Executes reporting procedure.


                     Guidelines for Development and Use
                      Use when the performance of steps or activities of a task is to be
                      evaluated.
                      The steps or activities must be observable.
                      Define all of the steps or activities of the task being performed.
                      Sequence steps or activities in order of performance.
                      Provide space for "checking" the performance of each step or activity.
                      Provide space for recording and describing errors.

Performance test   When a performance test requires the product of a task to be evaluated,
using a product    you will use a product checklist. The product checklist should identify
checklist          criteria or characteristics of product acceptability.

                                  Review Existing Materials


 Introduction          Developing training materials can be expensive and time-consuming.
                       Therefore, after developing objectives and tests, review existing training
                       materials to determine if materials exist that will support course
                       objectives. If materials are found, they may have to be modified to fit
                       your needs.



 Sources of existing   Existing training materials may be obtained from:

                         Other agencies [Legal, Military Equal Opportunity (MEO), Public
                         Health, Readiness, Medical]
                         Other services
                         Other federal agencies
                         Commercial/industrial organizations
                         Colleges and universities



 Types of existing     When reviewing existing training materials, you may find them in one of
 materials             the following forms:

                         Printed materials (e.g., lesson plans, textbooks, publications, technical
                         orders, job aids)
                         Slides
                         Videos
                         Audio cassettes
                         Computer-based (interactive courseware, ICW)
                         Training aids

                       Does the material meet the requirements of the
                       objective(s)?
                       Does the material support Air Force doctrine and
                       philosophy ?
                       Do test items measure the objectives?
                       Is the difficulty level of the material appropriate?
                       Is the material accurate?
                       Is the material current?
                       Is the material proprietary or copyrighted?



Modifying existing   If you find you need to modify existing materials to meet your needs,
materials            you will enter the Development Phase (see Chapter 6) to make these
                     modifications. Modifications may include:

                       Expand existing materials to include more detailed information,
                       diagrams, illustrations and examples.
                       Delete material that does not support the objective(s).
                       Revise material to support the target audience's reading level/
                       comprehension.
                       Update material to correct inaccuracies and to include the most current
                       information such as revised procedures and data.
                       Resequence material to make it compatible with the training design.
                       Add practical exercises and questions to support learning the material.

 Introduction    If you cannot find any existing material that fits your needs, you will
                 design new training. The training strategies, training method, and media
                 you select determine the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the training
                 program. Training design should be determined by what best meets the
                 training needs rather than just using a particular training design that has
                 always been used in your training organization.

                                 Determine Training Strategies



Introduction          Once objectives and test items are written you will design training to
                      support specific training strategies. Training strategies are necessary to
                      maximize the transfer of learning from the training setting to the job.
                      Selection of training strategies must support the learning objectives,
                      trainees' knowledge and ability level, and the overall training philosophy
                      or concept.



Determining           Training strategies involve the following two issues:
training strategies
                        Trainee participation
                        Trainee feedback



Trainee               Active trainee participation is essential for learning to take place.
participation         Trainees learn by doing, thinking, and feeling through answering
                      questions, discussing, manipulating, and putting ideas together. Learning
                      is a process in which trainees gain skills and knowledge and shape
                      attitudes through their own activities, experiences, and motivations. The
                      training strategy ensures trainees are active in the learning process and
                      can apply or demonstrate what they have learned. For each type of
                      learning, consider using the following strategies to ensure trainees
                      participate in the learning process .

                                      Demonstrate the task that the trainee is to perform.
                                      Have each trainee perform each step (subtask) of the
                                      task following the demonstration.
                                      Have each trainee perform the entire task with
                                      step-by-step guidance.
                                      Have each trainee perform the entire task with

                                      Use guided discussions to shape attitudes.



 Trainee feedback   Trainees need feedback on how well they are doing. Feedback not only
                    informs trainees on their progress, but also serves as a valuable source of
                    motivation. The training strategy should provide each trainee with
                    feedback, whether it is the results of a written test or instructor
                    comments during a class or during the performance of a task. During
                    lectures, demonstrations, and practical applications, instructors should
                    ask frequent questions and provide feedback to address any possible
                    trainee misunderstanding about the content or what is expected of the
                    trainee .

                                      Select Training Method



Introduction           The selection of a training method is the primary means of determining
                       how training will be presented to the trainee. Training method is the
                       process used to deliver the training content and to provide guidance for
                       trainees to retain the skills and knowledge imparted. Examples include
                       lecture, demonstration, practical application, self-study, and CBT.
                       The methods you select will have a direct impact on both the qualities of
                       the training program and its cost-effectiveness .



Considerations for     When selecting a training method, you must consider a number of
selecting a training   factors based on instructional requirements:
method
                         Objectives/learning outcomes
                         Transfer of learning
                         Resource constraints



Objectives/            The training method selected should stimulate learning to enable
learning outcomes      mastery of the objectives. This can be done by selecting a training
                       method that complements the behavior of the objective. For example, if
                       the objective involves performance of a task, the training method should
                       include some form of practical application. Likewise, an objective
                       requiring the trainee to recall information may best be presented via
                       lecture.

 Transfer of         Transfer of learning is the extent to which what is trained is carried over
 learning            to the job. Training should strive to provide as realistic conditions as
                     possible to the job to increase trainee retention of the material and
                     maximize transfer of learning. Trainees also learn best when they
                     actively participate in training. When trainees only use one sense during
                     training, such as hearing (e.g., lecture), transfer of learning is low.
                     Transfer of learning increases as trainees use additional senses and is
                     maximized when trainees can experience performing a task.

Resource          The training method selected must be able to be supported by available
constraints       time, instructors, facilities, equipment, and funding. While resource
                  constraints can become the deciding factor, you should first consider
                  objectives and transfer of learning when selecting a training method.
                  This will ensure every effort is made to base the selection on
                  instructional factors.



Training method   Once you have designed the training activities, use the information to
options           select the best training method(s) to achieve the objective. There are
                  many training methods you can select. Some options follow.

                   Can limit individualized feedback and reinforcement to trainees in
                   large groups.
                   Has a low transfer of learning unless integrated with other training
                   methods supported by media (e.g., demonstration, guided discussion,
                   practical application) .
 Demonstration   Presentation or portrayal of a sequence of events to demonstrate a
                 procedure, technique, or operation; frequently used in conjunction with
                 lecture. Demonstrations may include presentations of models, videos,
                 maps, or a live demonstration by an instructor.
                 Advantages:
                   Increases trainee retention because trainee hears and sees sequence of
                   events.
                   Allows performance standards to be demonstrated.
                   Provides immediate feedback because trainee can observe correct
                   sequence of events .
                   Cost-effective to prepare and revise materials.
                 Disadvantages:
                   May be difficult for all trainees to see demonstration in a large group.
                   Requires additional preparation time on the part of instructor.

                         Training Methods (Continued)
Self study       Trainees review and study instructional materials designed for this
                 purpose at their own pace.
                 Advantages:
                   Cost-effective to prepare and revise materials.
                   May be appropriate if instructors are not available.
                   May be appropriate if there is a lack of adequate facilities and
                   equipment to handle trainee flow.
                   May be retained by trainee and used as a training or job aid.
                 Disadvantages:
                   Provides limited interaction with instructor and no interaction with
                   other trainees.
                   Trainees' understanding of material can not be relied upon until
                   intervention by instructor; critical tasks should not be trained using
                   this method.
Computer-based   CBT, also referred to as interactive courseware (ICW), involves trainees
training (CBT)   interacting, at their own pace, to instruction presented through a variety
                 of media controlled and monitored by a computer.
                 Advantages:
                   May increase the level of trainee interactivity with instructional
                   materials .

                   May reduce training time.
                   May reduce instructor requirements.
                   May increase the transfer of learning to the operational job
                   environment.
                 Disadvantages:
                   Usually requires significant advanced planning and lead-time.
                   Requires reliable and consistent access to a properly configured
                   computer and availability of technical support.
                   Revisions sometimes require significant time, effort, and resources.
                   Some degree of computer literacy and proficiency training might be
                   required for students to ensure their effective use of the instructional
                   media.

                                       Select Media



 Introduction     Although selection of training methods and media is discussed
                  individually, they cannot always be considered separately. No single
                  medium is the most appropriate choice for every training situation.
                  Media should complement course topics and the training methods
                  selected. Media are the means used to communicate information and are
                  selected to enhance, support, and supplement presentation of the
                  instruction. Media can improve trainee attention during training and
                  increase transfer of learning by appealing to many senses (e.g., hearing,
                  seeing, experiencing). Media must be selected to support class size to
                  ensure all trainees can see or hear the information being presented .



 Types of media   There are several types of training media, as shown below.

                           Types of Media                           Examples
                  Traditional audiovisual devices         Chalkboards

                                                          Slides
                                                          Videotapes
                                                          Film strips

Media             Media have various characteristics that make them either suitable or
characteristics   unsuitable for particular training situations. Consider these
                  characteristics carefully to ensure that the appropriate media are selected
                  to support the training program. The advantages and limitations of each
                  type of media follow.

 Introduction           After learning objectives have been grouped and sequenced, a
                        framework or structure for each lesson may be determined. A course
                        chart presents the structure of a course, breaking it down by instructional
                        hour and instructional day. The course chart for BMT exists. If there are
                        any revisions to the curriculum, training time, or administrative time,
                        revisions must be made to update the course chart.


                        A course chart contains, at a minimum, the following:

(Continued )                              Review the list of sequenced objectives (see Section
                                          A) and chunk them into information deemed
                                          appropriate and manageable for a single lesson
                                          plan. One period of instruction should convey a
                                          block of information broken into discrete topics. If
                                          enabling objectives support the lesson, generally
                                          each topic will support an individual enabling
                                          objective.

                                          Select learning objectives that are closely related;
                                          combined, they should make a self-contained group
                                          suitable for an individual lesson .

                                          Combine learning objectives so that the group has a
                                          natural beginning and ending point.

                                          Look for "natural breaks" in the sequenced
                                          objectives that indicate major changes in subject
                                          matter, for example: one topic to another, going
                                          from theory/knowledge to performance/skill, etc.
                                          Group learning objectives by these "natural breaks"
                                          and organize them into individual lesson plans .



                       Step 2: Assign     Assign lesson titles that are meaningful and relate to
                       lesson titles      the lesson content or purpose.



                       Step 3: Estimate   Estimate the training time required to present each
                       training time      lesson. Base this on trainee throughput, training
                                          method, and the complexity of the subject matter.
                                          Scheduled and unscheduled training time must be
                                          accounted for .

                                            by a 24-hour per day schedule. The training
                                            environment is highly structured and trainees are
                                            under constant supervision, so every hour in the
                                            course must be accounted for. All administrative
                                            functions must be detailed in the course chart.


                        Step 5: Estimate    Estimate the time it will take to complete
                        administrative      administrative functions. Base this on trainee
                        time                throughput and resource support.



                        Step 6: Total       Add the hours of training and administrative time to
                        training/           get totals for each.

                          Update Course Training Plan


Introduction     A Course Training Plan (CTP) for BMT exists. As you revise curriculum
                 or add curriculum, you must update the CTP to reflect these changes.
                 This includes any changes to resource requirements in support of the
                 course. This is generally done at the end of the Design Phase when you
                 have adequate data to document your plan for the training program.
                 Development of the CTP may possibly continue into the Development
                 Phase before it is finalized .



What is a CTP?   A CTP provides the basis for planning, programming, and implementing
                 training. It is the justification that describes the training program in terms
                 of:

                   Purpose
                   Type of training
                   Training design
                   Training content
                   Course parameters
                   Resources required



Purpose of CTP   A well-developed CTP can serve several purposes depending on the
                 nature and scope of the training itself. Some of its purposes are to:

                   Describe and document the training program.
                   Identify resources that are required to operate and support the training
                   program.
                   Serve as the approval document to operate the training program.



Who is           Managers are directly responsible for developing a CTP to describe and
responsible?     document the training program. To revise the plan, the manager will
                 need input from curriculum developers.

 CTP format and   The CTP generally includes an administrative section, a narrative text,
 content          annexes, and appendices that justify and support the resource
                  requirements and detail schedules of the plan. When updating the CTP,
                  revise only those sections affected by revisions or additions to the BMT
                  program.



 Narrative        The narrative part of the CTP provides an overview of the information in
                  the annexes and appendixes. It describes the rationale, assumptions, and
                  conditions pertaining to the planned course. The following items are
                  included in the narrative:



                  Purpose            The purpose of the CTP.

Introduction      A Plan of Instruction (POI) serves as the overall plan or blueprint for
                  conducting training in a given course. POIs ensure training is
                  standardized. The POI serves as a control document for planning,
                  organizing, and conducting training .



POI contents      The POI serves as a course control document, organized by units and
                  lessons in the preferred sequence of instruction. It lists learning
                  objectives, support materials needed, and training time. A POI may be
                  developed from scratch for new training; if training is revised, the POI
                  must be updated to reflect these changes. The POI consists of two parts:

                    Part I of the POI is prepared on AETC Form 133, Plan of Instruction/
                    Lesson Plan Part I. Part I contains administrative information
                    supporting the lesson plan.

                    Part II of the POI contains the instructional content.



POI/Lesson Plan   Part I of the POI contains the following elements.

                                     Introduction



 Introduction   The Introduction contains, as appropriate, a review, attention, overview,
                motivation, and transition.



 Attention      The Attention should be developed to capture trainee interest in the
                topic.



 Overview       The Overview should present the topics that will be covered in the
                lesson. Generally, each topic will be supported by a section of the
                instruction supporting a single objective. Number each topic to
                correspond to its number in the Body of the instruction.


 Objective      Present learning objectives early in the lesson to provide a focus and to
                inform trainees what performance is expected of them.



 Motivation     The Motivation should build on the Attention by relating the lesson
                content to trainees. It should inform trainees why this information is
                important to them or how it is relevant to being an enlisted member of
                the Air Force.
AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003                                                                     145


                                          Body



Introduction     The Body includes the instructional presentation, application, and
                 evaluation, as applicable. The Body is the detailed script of the material
                 to be taught. The Body includes all of the information necessary for
                 trainees to master the specified objectives.



Topics of        The Body is broken into topics of instruction, as presented in the
Instruction      Overview section of the Introduction. Each topic should present a main
                 idea and should follow a logical sequence. If a lesson is supported by
                 enabling objectives, in general, each topic may support a separate
                 objective. In this way, once learning objectives are sequenced in the
                 Design Phase, the instructional content may be fleshed out in the lesson
                 plan to support each objective. This provides the content for each topic
                 of a lesson and ensures the instructional material flows in a logical
                 sequence to maximize learning. Chunk topics so no topic is more than 50
                 minutes in length. A standard one-hour lesson is broken down by 50
                 minutes of instruction and a 10-minute break. Present information in the
                 Body on the left-hand side of the page.



Transitions      Transitions tie together main ideas in the lesson. The instructor can
                 convey relevance of course materials in transitions. Transitions should
                 reinforce the conceptual framework of the lesson, allow the instructor to
                 use questioning techniques and gather feedback from trainees, and allow
                 a smooth flow of material. Present Transitions on the right-hand side of
                 the page so they stand out from the instructional content.



Cues             Cues can assist the instructor in the presentation of the instruction. Cues
                 should be placed in the right-hand side of the page so they stand out
                 from the instructional content. There are several types of cues, presented
                 below.



                 Media cue            Media cues indicate what media (e.g., slide,
                                      transparency, model) to use and when to present it
                                      during instruction.

 Cues (Continued)   Demonstration        Demonstration cues indicate when to conduct a
                    cue                  demonstration during instruction.


                    Question cue         Question cues remind instructors to ask trainees
                                         questions. Instructors should pose questions
                                         continually throughout training to maintain rapport,
                                         stimulate interaction, check understanding, receive
                                         feedback, and generate trainee interest.


                    Instructor           Instructor notes can include any information
                    notes                pertinent to the conduct of the lesson such as points
                                         to emphasize, examples, etc.

                     know what self-study assignments are required of the course.



 Remotivation        The Remotivation reiterates why the information is important for
                     trainees to know as well as its overall relevance to the Air Force mission.



 Closure             The Closure should emphasize and reinforce key points and provide
                     closure to the instruction.



 Application         If trainees will be provided practice in performing the topics covered in
                     the lesson, the Application explains when and where trainees will do so
                     in a practical application .

OVERVIEW: Today we will cover:

            1. Triage
            2. Casualty Assessment
            3. External Hemorrhage

OBJECTIVE: Given a casualty in a field setting, perform basic first aid.

MOTIVATION: Imagine yourself in an accident. First, you’re unconscious, then you awake
and see a circle of people just standing around you not knowing what to do. You slowly drift

       (1) Primary Survey - Purpose is to find and treat the most life
 threatening emergencies. Examples:


           (a) Opening an airway in an unconscious person.


           (b) Stopping arterial bleeding.


      (2) Secondary Survey - Purpose is to uncover all other injuries
 and attempt to stabilize and treat the problems found. Examples:


           (a) Splinting fractures.


           (b) Stopping external bleeding.


           (c) Treating burn injuries.

                                                                         TRANSITION: Once

     (1) Minimal (Green) - casualties can be returned to duty with
minimal treatment; no priority for treatment. Examples:

         (a) Small lacerations.

         (b) Contusions with controlled bleeding.

       (2) Immediate (Red) - victims whose conditions are so urgent
that immediate treatment is needed to save life or limb. This is the
highest priority for treatment. Examples:

         (a) Hemorrhage from easily controlled site.

         (b) Open chest or abdominal wound.

         (c) Rapidly correctable respiratory defects.

               SELF AID AND BUDDY CARE APPLICATION EXERCISE


  Objective: Given a casualty in a field setting, perform basic first aid.

  Mission: Divide flights into teams of 10. The team must assess and apply field dressings to
  wounds given a specific battle injury/symptom scenario. The team will select a team leader to
  brief the rest of the trainees on their scenario and their actions to treat the victim. The entire
  group will critique the response.

  Victim: Hemorrhage victim – external bleeding; lower leg (Supplies: Bandage/T-shirts)
       Triage Category: Minimal (Green)

       Signs and symptoms:

       a. Capillary (dark red/oozing) bleeding from lower leg

       Response:

       a. Elevate limb.

       b. Try direct pressure first (clean material or heel of hand or fingers).

       c. If direct pressure does not work, then try compression of pressure points (compress
       femoral artery against pelvis with the heel of your hand).

       d. As a last resort ONLY, try the tourniquet.

       e. Tourniquet must be at least 2 inches wide.

   f. Place it around the limb between the wound and the heart approximately 2-4 inches
   above the injury – NEVER directly on the wound.

   g. Tie a knot.

   h. Pass a stick under the loop.

   i. Twist the stick enough to stop the bleeding.

   j. If you cannot feel a pulse, the tourniquet pressure is sufficient.

   k. Tie the stick in place.

   l. Do not loosen or disturb.

   m. Leave the tourniquet exposed and mark a "T" on the victim's forehead and indicate the
   time the tourniquet was applied.

                                      Develop Media


 Introduction       In the Design Phase, you selected the training method and media that
                    best suit your training needs. In this phase, you will develop the media.
                    Media is used to enhance transfer of learning by presenting instruction
                    that appeals to many senses, while contributing to the smooth flow of
                    information. Regardless of the media selected, it is essential that you
                    develop a quality product since it is the means of communicating
                    instructional information to trainees.



 Examples           Examples of media range from slides, videotapes, audiotapes, films,
                    overhead transparencies, charts, graphs, maps, Interactive Courseware,
                    etc.



 Factors in media   Several factors affect the development of training media. The relative
 development        importance of each of these factors depends on the type of media
                    selected. Development factors are:


                      Personnel
                      Time
                      Cost



 Development        Development of training media requires many activities to be performed.
 activitie s        The type and number of these activities depend upon the type of media
                    being developed. Some of the most common development activities
                    follow.

Who is           Developing media normally involves teamwork and requires various
responsible?     skills. Curriculum developers are responsible for planning, scheduling,
                 and making sure the media get produced and support the subject matter.

                            Prepare Trainee Materials


Introduction     Once a plan of instruction (POI) and media are prepared, accompanying
                 trainee materials may be developed. If POIs are revised, trainee
                 materials must be updated to reflect these changes. Trainee materials
                 consist of any written materials or graphics given to trainees for use
                 during a course.



Purpose          Trainee materials may serve a number of purposes:

                   A guide covering what is being presented in the course.
                   A study guide that trainees can refer to and follow during the course.
                   A job aid that trainees can take with them upon graduation.


Contents         There are different types of trainee materials used in support of BMT:

                   Trainee materials may contain the instructional content of academic
                   subjects. For example, lesson material pertaining to military studies is
                   contained in BMT Manual II. The materials contain all of the
                   information contained in POIs, but at a much more detailed level.
                   Whereas POI Part II may be presented in a bulletized fashion for the
                   instructor to fill in the gaps, trainee materials contain all of the
                   information pertaining to a particular subject that supports
                   accomplishment of an objective.

                   Trainee materials may contain graphics, photographs, and illustrations
                   used to explain points. These may be the same media used by the
                   instructor during the class.

                   Trainee materials may contain review exercises the trainee may
                   complete to test his knowledge of the subject matter.

                   Trainee materials may include supplemental materials such as
                   handouts to prepare for a class, answer keys to quizzes, additional
                   reading and reference materials (e.g., technical manuals, charts,
                   graphs, maps), and instructions for participation in a practical exercise
                   .

                        Support POIs.
                        Are organized and sequenced by the POIs they support.
                        Are easy to understand and follow.
                        Use labeled graphics, photographs, tables, and charts that illustrate the
                        teaching points.
                        Target the trainee audience and their vocabulary level.

                           Validate Training Materials


Introduction     Prior to implementing training, it must be validated to ensure the training
                 materials are effective. Validation is conducted to ensure materials train
                 and measure those skills and knowledge necessary for job performance.
                 Validation assesses the effectiveness of instruction while it is being
                 developed with the intention of improving it. It is a process of repetitive
                 cycles of development, tryouts, and revision until evidence shows that
                 the instruction is effective.



When should      When possible, validation is done as segments, units, or blocks of
validation be    instruction are developed or revised. If only a single lesson plan has been
done?            revised, it may be validated with the next iteration of the course.
                 However, it is best to wait until all of the materials have been developed
                 before determining its effectiveness.

                                  Develop Validation Plan



 Introduction      For a training program to be effective, adequate planning should take
                   place in the initial stages of training development. A part of that
                   planning is the validation plan, which details how the program or subsets
                   of the program will be validated. A validation plan provides curriculum
                   developers and instructors with a roadmap for validating the instruction.
                   A validation plan provides organization and credibility to the validation
                   process.



 Who is            Validation planning is the responsibility of managers within the
 responsible?      organization or the design team. This responsibility is often delegated to
                   curriculum developers since they often provide much of the information
                   that goes into the validation plan such as the validation schedule and
                   number of tryouts to be conducted .


                   Validation plans may contain information such as:
 Validation plan
 contents            Course title and number.
                     Reason for validation (minor changes to lesson plans, new equipment,
                     etc.) .
                     Validation schedule. Describe the period of validation including start
                     and end dates.
                     Description of materials to be validated (e.g., objectives, method,
                     media, tests, lesson plans).
                     Validation procedures including:
                       Who will conduct the validation.
                       How data will be collected (surveys of instructors, trainees, etc.; test
                       data; recycle and elimination data; observation data).
                       Number of tryouts to be conducted.
                       Number and availability of trainees to be used in the tryouts .

                          Conduct Technical Accuracy Reviews



Introduction       The technical accuracy review is the first step of validation. This review
                   identifies inaccuracies and weaknesses in the materials under review so
                   they may be corrected. Materials should be thoroughly reviewed since
                   this may be the last opportunity to revise draft materials before they are
                   tried out on trainees. If possible, conduct technical accuracy reviews
                   each time instruction is developed, updated, or revised .



Who should         Internal reviews should be conducted by:

                             Conduct Operational (Field) Tryouts



Introduction         Once materials have been revised as a result of technical accuracy
                     reviews, materials may be validated through operational (field) tryouts.
                     There are a variety of methods for validating instruction. The most
                     powerful method is conduct of a field tryout. In this method, training
                     materials are presented to the actual target audience under normal
                     operating conditions.



Why field tryout     In many validation methods (e.g., individual trials, small group tryouts),
and not some other   trainees representing the target audience are selected for participation in
method?              the validation prior to implementation of the program or revised
                     materials. The entry-level BMT environment is unique in that it is not
                     possible to select members representing the target audience because
                     there is not access to the civilian population that makes up the audience.
                     Therefore, a field tryout is conducted using actual trainees currently
                     enrolled in BMT. In this case, validation and implementation of the new
                     training are conducted concurrently. If revisions to the materials are
                     identified during validation, they will be made before the official
                     approval of the training materials.



Purpose              The purpose of field tryouts is to:

                       Determine if the training program actually works under operational
                       conditions.
                       Provide feedback from the target audience to base final revisions or
                       refinements to the training program.
                       Work out any implementation or operational problems to include
                       equipment, training aids, facilities, and instructor preparation.



Trainee selection    To ensure a valid sample, select three flights from three separate
                     squadrons to participate in the validation. This provides a
                     cross-reference of trainees in environments shaped by different
                     instructors and the general atmosphere of different squadrons. Having a
                     varied selection will produce more reliable results.

 Collect data    You may collect data in support of a field tryout using a variety of
                 methods:

                   Survey questionnaires completed by trainees, instructors, SMEs,
                   curriculum developers
                   Observation of validation
                   Trainee test data (written and performance tests)
                   Interviews with trainees and instructors

                 These data collection tools are used to measure each component of the
                 training program (e.g., content, sequence, media, time, instructor
                 performance, environment) against a predetermined standard.



 Types of data   The following data may be gathered as part of the field tryouts.



 Trainee data    Trainee data are collected to determine the attitude of trainees when they
                 are presented the instruction, particularly anything they felt kept them
                 from mastering the objectives. You may ask trainees specific questions
                 regarding :

                   Length of instruction.
                   Difficulty of instruction.
                   Interest/motivation level.

                 Throughout validation, instructors, as well as SMEs and curriculum
                 developers (if possible), should observe trainees to collect data on:


                   Difficulty or ease with specific material or practical applications.
                   Questions trainees ask.
                   Injuries.
                   Trainee remediation.
                   Trainee washbacks and eliminations.

Training material   Information on the effectiveness of the training material should be
data                gathered from instructors, SMEs, curriculum developers, and trainees.
                    The most valuable information will come from instructors; SMEs and
                    curriculum developers can also provide valuable insight through
                    observation of training. Collect data regarding the effectiveness of:

                      Lesson plans (classroom and practical application)
                      Trainee materials
                      Media



Test item data      Test items should be analyzed to assess their validity (they measure what
                    they are supposed to measure) and their reliability (they measure the
                    same variables every time they are administered). This is done through a
                    process called test item analysis (detailed procedures for conducting this
                    analysis are presented in Chapter 8, Section C). Item analysis will
                    identify which test items need to be revised or rejected. In support of
                    validation, the 737 TRSS Course Evaluation Element (TSDE) conducts
                    test item analysis after two administrations of the tests.



Training            Information on the effectiveness of the training methods and procedures
procedures dat a    should be gathered from instructors, SMEs, curriculum developers, and
                    trainees. The most valuable information will come from instructors;
                    SMEs and curriculum developers can also provide valuable insight
                    through observation of training. Collect data regarding the effectiveness
                    of:

                      Training method
                      Training sequence
                      Training time
                      Training setting (e.g., classroom, field environment, drill pad)
                      Training equipment
                      Instructor presentation

 Analyze data     Once the operational tryouts have been conducted, you will analyze the
                  data gathered during the tryouts. Analyze the data to determine:

                    Effectiveness of training materials in enabling mastery of objectives .
                    Average time it took to complete each lesson or segment of a lesson .
                    Areas of the instruction deemed by trainees as weak, confusing,
                    non-motivating, too difficult, or too easy.
                    Effectiveness of training environment, equipment, and number of
                    instructors to support objectives.
                    Revisions to training materials, environment, equipment, and

                    Priority for accomplishing revisions or changes and plan of
                    accomplishment.

                  If the training or materials require significant revisions or changes, it is
                  recommended that additional field tryouts be conducted to determine if
                  the revisions were effective. As with other forms of validation, continue
                  to try out, and revise as long as the quality of the training program is
                  improved.

                  (Additional information on analyzing data is covered in
                  Chapter 8.)



 Report results   Document any actions to be taken to improve the training program in a
                  validation report. The validation report should be completed within 30
                  calendar days of completion of the validation. The validation report
                  should include :

                    A summary of the validation process to include flights and squadrons .
                    Any known resource constraints during validation.
                    A summary of significant findings to include trainee performance and
                    adequacy of the training program.
                    Conclusions and corrective actions to include specific
                    recommendations for improving the program .

                               Finalize Training Materials


Introduction         After you have validated the training, you must finalize the training
                     materials. During this step, you make sure that all necessary changes are
                     made to the training materials to ensure they are complete, current, and
                     accurate.



When should          All revisions to training materials are coordinated with the 737 TRSS
training materials   Course Development Element (TSDC). Recommended changes will be
be revised?          submitted in writing using the following guidelines:

                       State the suggested change or update.
                       Explain the reason for the change or update.
                       Explain the objective that the change or update meets.
                       Describe the impact of the change or update.
                       Indicate if the change or update is safety driven and why.


                     If the change requires immediate implementation, such as for safety or
                     welfare reasons, TSDC will make the revisions to the materials. If the
                     change does not require immediate implementation, TSDC will hold the
                     suggestion for consideration during the next annual review.



What needs to be     When finalizing training materials, update:
updated?
                       Plans that have been developed.
                       Course control documents.

File materials   Lesson plans must be maintained and filed. TSDC will maintain the CTP
                 (including the CTS and Course Chart) and four master lesson plan sets
                 contained in separate volumes:

                   Master Lesson Plan Set A will consist of curriculum taught in the first
                   and fourth blocks of training (processing, orientations, drill, and
                   dormitory).

                   Master Lesson Plan Set B will consist of curriculum taught during the
                   third block of training (Warrior Week).

                   Master Lesson Plan Set C will consist of curriculum taught in the
                   second block of training (academic lessons that are evaluated during
                   the end-of-course test).

                   Master Lesson Plan Set D will consist of curriculum taught in the Prior
                   Service Sister Service Enlistee (PSSSE) Orientation Course.


                 Maintain a master copy of each academic written test with answer sheet
                 and correlation between each objective and test item.



Change pages     Any revisions to training materials must be recorded on change pages.
                 Change pages are filed in the appropriate Master Lesson Plan and
                 instructor's lesson plan with the most current change page on top. An

                                            Overview



Introduction          For training implementation to be effective, you must have done your
                      job well in the Planning, Analysis, Design, and Development Phases of
                      ISD. The work you do there sets the stage for how well the training
                      program will be executed. As a BMT curriculum developer, your role in
                      implementation will be limited. The primary role is played by Military
                      Training Instructors (MTI) and their ability to impart the training
                      materials to the trainee audience.



BMT curriculum        Your role during implementation will consist of a support role. Your
developers' role in   primary function is to ensure training materials are accurate and ready
implementation        for implementation. Once the course is implemented, you will
                      periodically conduct an operational evaluation to ensure the course
                      continues to operate effectively and cost-efficiently and to produce
                      graduates who can meet the job performance requirements (see Chapter
                      8).

                     Support Training Program Functions


 Introduction    Because your role is critical to the overall success of the training
                 program, you should understand the functions in place to support,
                 implement, and maintain the program. Program functions can be divided
                 into management, support, administration, and delivery. This section
                 discusses each of these functions.

                                 Management Function


Introduction     Every individual within the training organization has certain management
                 responsibilities. For example :

                   Instructors manage the teaching/learning activity.
                   Instructors' supervisors manage the scheduling of courses and ensure
                   instructors are available and properly trained.
                   Curriculum developers manage development of the training materials .


Management       The management function controls the day-to-day implementation of
activities       training. As a curriculum developer, you may provide input into how these
                 functions are being carried out, particularly the evaluating and reporting
                 functions. The management function includes :

                 Organizing        Organizing the resources to include identifying,
                                   arranging, scheduling, and bringing together resources
                                   such as personnel, equipment, and facilities required to
                                   implement the training program .

                 Coordinating      Establishing lines of communication with supporting
                                   organizations such as resource management, civil
                                   engineering, and logistics to ensure availability of
                                   resources.

                 Evaluating        Reviewing training and materials for accuracy,
                                   currency, and availability (see Chapter 8).

                                          Support Function


Introduction           You can design, develop, and implement an outstanding training program,
                       but without the necessary support, it will not be effective nor
                       cost-efficient. The support function for BMT already exists. The structure
                       is there and training support activities are actively supporting the program.
                       Each time a new course is developed or an existing course is revised,
                       support requirements must be identified. You identified support
                       requirements early in the ISD process. During implementation, your role
                       is limited to identifying any support deficiencies you observe that affect
                       delivery of the training .


Definition             The support function includes long-range as well as day-to-day tasks
                       performed by training support organizations in order to implement and
                       maintain the training program. Examples of support functions are :

                         Maintaining equipment and facilities.
                         Supplying equipment and materials for the course.
                         Providing services such as engineering, visual, and publication.

                                Administration Function


Introduction     The administration function maintains documents such as equipment,
                 supply, and trainee records. As a BMT curriculum developer, you may not
                 be involved in any administrative activities. However, you should still be
                 aware of what is being done on a daily basis by other organizations to
                 support and maintain the training program. The administration function
                 should be in place before successfully implementing a training program.
                 For example, the training materials must be produced and available,
                 trainees must be scheduled and tracked, and health and welfare concerns
                 must have been addressed.

Administration   Administration includes activities such as:
activities
                   Provide administrative support for documents such as training
                   standards, plans of instruction, lesson plans, and trainee workbooks .
                   Maintain personnel, training, and equipment records.
                   Track trainee data. BMT curriculum developers play an important role
                   in tracking trainee performance data (see Chapter 8).

                                        Delivery Function


Introduction         The delivery function is largely the purview of MTIs. You supported this
                     function during design and development of the training program by
                     ensuring the appropriate delivery method was selected and training
                     materials were ready to function prior to implementation.


Supporting           During implementation, MTIs use presentation techniques that promote
presentation         effective learning. As a curriculum developer, you were instrumental in
                     this process by designing and developing training materials that:

                       Maximized the similarity between the training environment and the job
                       setting.
                       Contained objectives that were sequenced from simple to complex .
                       Provided trainee practice through practical applications.
                       Built in progress checks and question periods to provide feedback and
                       elicit participation.


Ensuring readiness   At this point, the delivery function should be fully developed and
                     operational. Validation will have given an indication of the suitability and
                     readiness of the training program; however, prior to implementation,
                     managers, MTIs, and curriculum developers work together to ensure
                     everything is ready. The following questions must be answered:

                       Are there adequate instructors to support the training requirements ?
                       Have the instructors been qualified, and are they certified to deliver the
                       instruction?
                       Are training materials available in adequate quantities to support
                       training?
                       Are trainee workbooks printed in adequate numbers?
                       Is the necessary training and support equipment available and
                       operational such as computers, projectors, and weapons?
                       Have slides and/or transparencies been produced?
                       Are training facilities ready and operational?

                                 Monitor and Refine Training


Introduction           During implementation, curriculum developers monitor and refine
                       training as necessary. Curriculum developers have the responsibility to
                       ensure that deficiencies identified during operation are corrected and all
                       materials are updated as necessary.


Monitoring training Curriculum developers have a vested interest in BMT. A lot of work went
                    into the analysis, design, and development of the training materials.
                    Therefore, curriculum developers can readily identify anything, such as
                    deficiencies in equipment, facilities, or instruction, that does not support
                    the training program as designed. For example, instructors are not allowed
                    to change the training at will. They must follow the plan of instruction
                    (POI). Anything the curriculum developer observes that is in violation of
                    the course training plan or POIs should be noted and reported.


Evaluation during      During implementation, curriculum developers continually conduct
implementation         operational evaluations to ensure the program continues to operate
                       effectively and cost-efficiently, producing graduates who can meet job
                       performance requirements. Evaluation maintains the quality of the
                       training program because necessary revisions are identified and made by
                       curriculum developers to improve the program. (Chapter 8 covers
                       operational evaluation extensively. )

                                          Overview

Introduction       Evaluation is a continuous process throughout each phase of ISD. The
                   purpose of planning and conducting evaluation is to determine the
                   effectiveness and efficiency of a training program. A training program is
                   effective when it allows mastery of objectives that are based on job
                   requirements; and efficient when it makes the best use of resources (e.g.,
                   personnel, time, funding, equipment, supplies). BMT curriculum
                   developers are responsible for planning and conducting evaluations.
Purpose            There are three types of evaluation. The purpose of this chapter is to
                   present the procedures for conducting an operational evaluation.
                   Formative and summative evaluations are covered in Chapter 6, Section
                   D

                   depicted in the model, each stage in the ISD process involves evaluation
                   activities.

                                    Section A
                                Types of Evaluation



Introduction     There are three types of evaluation. The distinction among the types can
                 be made by determining when the evaluation is being conducted and the
                 focus of the evaluation. All three types of evaluation are conducted for
                 newly developed training materials as well as when significant revisions
                 or updates have been made to an existing training program.


Formative        Formative evaluation is conducted during the development or revision of a
evaluation       training program. Within BMT, formative evaluation consists of technical
                 accuracy reviews of the training materials. Formative evaluation is the
                 method used to validate training materials prior to implementing the
                 program (see Chapter 6, Section D).

                   The primary focus of formative evaluation is to review the effectiveness
                   and efficiency of course materials and to make any revisions prior to
                   implementation.
                   It does not focus on evaluating trainee performance.
                   It will only rarely assess training environment and instructor
                   performance.


Summative        Summative evaluation involves trying out the instruction on the target
evaluation       audience in an operational environment. Within BMT, summative
                 evaluation consists of operational field tryouts conducted on selected
                 flights currently undergoing BMT to determine the "summed" effect of the
                 instruction under operational conditions. Summative evaluation is one of
                 the methods used to validate training materials (see Chapter 6, Section
                 D).

Operational   Once a training program or revisions to a training program are made and
evaluation    the program is implemented and starts producing graduates, it is time to
              begin conducting operational evaluation. Operational evaluation is a
              continuous process that assesses how well course graduates are meeting
              established job performance requirements. Operational evaluation is
              designed to gather and analyze internal and external feedback data to
              ensure the training program continues to effectively and cost-efficiently
              produce graduates who meet established training requirements .


Evaluation    The focus of an operational evaluation further dictates the activities that
activities    will take place in the evaluation. There are two types of activities:

                Internal evaluation
                External evaluation


Internal      Internal evaluation focuses on evaluating the training program internally
evaluation    through instructor comments, trainee critiques, and test results. The focus
              of this evaluation is on identifying revisions that may be made to improve
              the program. Internal evaluations are scheduled events that take place a
              specific number of times annually. In addition, no-notice internal
              evaluations are conducted. Anyone can make suggestions to improve
              BMT curriculum at any time.


              An internal evaluation can focus on one or all of the following:

                Training materials
                Trainee performance
                Instructor performance
                Training environment
AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003                                                                          191



External evaluation   External evaluation focuses on evaluating the training program externally
                      from the field through survey questionnaires and inspection and
                      evaluation reports. The focus of this evaluation is on identifying whether
                      graduates are meeting established job performance requirements. This
                      evaluation activity relies on input from the field (i.e., outside the BMT
                      environment) to determine how well graduates are performing.


                      The purpose of external evaluation is to determine if recent graduates of
                      the course :

                        Can meet job performance requirements.
                        Need all of the instruction they received.
                        Need any instruction they did not receive.


Who conducts          External evaluation is typically done by gathering data from graduates'
external              operational commands regarding graduate performance on the job.
evaluation?           However, BMT is unique because it seeks to impart pervasive attitudes,
                      values, and general knowledge required of all airmen. The knowledge,
                      skills, and attitudes acquired do not support a specific job. The knowledge
                      acquired by graduates of BMT is general and often only an orientation to a
                      particular subject is provided. Graduates of BMT report directly to
                      technical training (TT) where they will receive specific Air Force
                      Specialty Code (AFSC) training. Therefore, rather than operational
                      commands, external evaluation is formally conducted at the TT schools
                      where graduates report following BMT.


                      External evaluation is also informally conducted by members of the
                      operational forces and identified needs are communicated through BMT
                      Reviews or Out of Cycle Requirements (see Chapter 3). In fact, the
                      purpose of BMT Reviews is to evaluate BMT materials to ensure they are
                      meeting the needs of the operational forces.

                               Collect Evaluation Data


Introduction      Data collection is an important aspect of evaluation to ensure what is
                  being collected is accurate and to ensure it can be used to assess the
                  objectives your evaluation seeks to measure.


Focus of          The type of data collected and the methods used will depend on the focus

                    Trainee performance

Trainee test results   Trainee performance provides the most direct measure of training program
                       effectiveness. A trend of excellent or poor trainee performance may
                       indicate a need to evaluate the training program as a whole to determine if
                       the course trains and measures what it should. Trainee test results are
                       provided via written tests and performance tests. (Chapter 6 provides
                       details on how to collect data through tests.)

Observation            Data concerning trainee and instructor performance can be effectively
                       gathered via observation. Trainee performance is observed by instructors
                       during the conduct of practical applications and performance tests (see
                       Chapter 6). Instructor performance can be observed by supervisors, peer
                       instructors, and trainees during instruction. Observations are not
                       conducted alone; they should always be supported by questionnaire data
                       or performance test data. Observations may be recorded in response to
                       questions on a survey. They may also be recorded on a checklist during or
                       immediately following the observation; performance test data are recorded
                       on checklists (see Chapter 6). An example checklist for evaluating
                       instructor performance through observation follows.

Questionnaires   A questionnaire is a data collection instrument consisting of a printed form
                 containing a set of questions used to gather information from respondents.
                 Questionnaires collect subjective, qualitative data on respondents'
                 opinions about specific topics. Questionnaires are effective, cost-efficient
                 evaluation tools.


Advantages       Advantages of questionnaires include:

                   They are comparatively inexpensive to administer.
                   They can be used to collect large samples of data.
                   They yield data that can be easily tabulated and reported.
                   Respondents give their opinions freely.


Disadvantages    Disadvantages of questionnaires include:

                   Low return rates and inappropriate responses affect accuracy.
                   They collect only opinions, which may not be as reliable as other
                   methods of collecting data.
                   Communication is one-way; respondents may not understand some of
                   the questions.


Focus of data    Different questionnaires are developed depending on the focus of the
collection       evaluation and from whom data will be collected. Questionnaires may be
                 used to collect data on the following :

                   Training program. Trainees complete a Block I survey during the
                   second week of BMT. Trainees further complete a Block IV survey
                   during the sixth week of BMT. The surveys provide feedback in the
                   areas of processing, motivation, services, training environment,
                   instructor performance, and overall attitudes toward BMT. In addition,
                   a Trainee Comment Sheet is available to trainees throughout BMT;
                   trainees may complete the questionnaire at any time.

Focus of data         BMT graduate performance. The Airman Performance Survey (APS)
collection            is a web-based survey used to evaluate the quality of BMT graduates
(Continued)           during Technical Training (TT). TT academic instructors (AI) and
                      military training leaders (MTL) complete a survey rating the airman on
                      specific traits exhibited during TT.

                    Focus of evaluation         Distribute questionnaires to:
                    Instructor Performance      Trainees, instructors
                    Training Materials          Trainees, instructors, graduates
                    Training Environment        Trainees, instructors
                    Graduate Performance        AIs, MTLs



Guidelines for      Guidelines for writing effective questions are:
writing questions
                      Word questions to the respondent's level of understanding; use
                      vocabulary and concepts for which the respondent can relate.
                      Limit each question to one aspect of a topic.
                      Avoid questions that show biases or exceptions.
                      Word questions so they will not threaten respondents.


Methods of          There are two primary methods of recording responses on a questionnaire:
recording           rating scale and open-ended responses .
responses


Rating scale        A rating scale method of recording responses typically involves a
                    selection of possible answers corresponding to a spectrum of responses for
                    a specific topic. Respondents check the response that corresponds to the
                    intensity of their judgment of the topic. This method makes data analysis
                    easier, but it may not give the range of answers desired.

                    Example:

                    The organization of the instruction was:
                    ___ Very helpful
                    ___ Helpful
                    ___ Not very helpful
AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003                                                                       199



Open-ended       Open-ended questions allow respondents to provide additional comments,
responses        descriptions, and rationale for their answers. These questions are useful for
                 collecting data pertaining to the perceived effectiveness of a training
                 program. However, analyzing and quantifying these data are difficult
                 because a specific response cannot be selected.

                 Example:

                 What subjects would you add or delete from BMT?


Preparing        Well-constructed questionnaires that are properly administered are
questionnaires   extremely important to the evaluation process. Consider motivational
                 factors when developing questionnaires. You want respondents to answer
                 fully and conscientiously. To motivate respondents, questionnaires should:

                    Explain the purpose of the questionnaire.
                    Tell respondents how they can benefit from answering the question-
                    naire.
                    Provide space for the respondent's name, title, organization, and loca-
                    tion, as applicable.
                    Contain clear and concise instructions for completing the question-
                    naire. This includes specific descriptions for responding to rat-
                    ing-scale questions.
                    Be formatted so they appear uncluttered and easy to answer. For exam-
                    ple, arrange rating scale responses vertically rather than horizontally.



                                 Correct                           Incorrect
                                 Yes ___                      Yes ___ No ____
                                 No ____

                    Arrange questions in a logical order or group them under a common
                    topic heading.
                    Be numbered on each page.

Example               During BMT, trainees complete questionnaires regarding their
questionnaire --      impressions of BMT and the Air Force. In addition, topics include
                      questions rating how trainees were treated when they arrived at Lackland,
Trainee reaction to   clothing issue, job processing, living quarters, etc. The example
BMT                   questionnaire that follows contains some typical questions asked of
                      trainees regarding the effectiveness of a training program.

                  Each questionnaire should have a cover letter. When developing the cover
Guidelines for    letter, ensure it:
preparing cover
letters             Explains the purpose of the questionnaire and its importance to
                    improving instruction.
                    Includes a statement that assures the respondent that the information
                    will be treated confidentially .
                    Includes a statement that the evaluation is being conducted per AFI
                    36-2201.

Distribution of   Distribution of the questionnaire is a critical aspect of ensuring you collect
questionnaires    reliable and accurate data. Within BMT, questionnaires completed by
                  trainees and TT representatives are completed via the internet.
                  Questionnaires completed by instructors are completed in person and
                  submitted to BMT curriculum developers. When distributing the
                  questionnaire, you should:

                    Select a representative sample of your target audience (e.g., trainees,
                    instructors, MTLs) to ensure valid results.

                    Determine how many questionnaires you need to distribute. That
                    decision is based on:
                      Expected response rate.
                      Level of confidence (a statistical consideration which means the size
                      of the sample required for you to be, say, 95 percent sure the sample
                      truly represents the larger population). The sampling chart on the
                      following page shows how to determine the number of questionnaires
                      you need based on this consideration.

                  Determine when to distribute the questionnaires. Currently within BMT,
                  trainees complete questionnaires regarding the BMT program during the
                  second and sixth week of BMT. TT representatives complete
                  questionnaires regarding graduate performance during the third or fourth
                  week of TT.

                                          Section C
                                  Analyze Evaluation Results


  Introduction         Once evaluation data are gathered, they must be analyzed and their results
                       interpreted. Evaluation results must be carefully analyzed to assess student
                       mastery of objectives and to identify instructional proficiencies and
                       deficiencies so that the training program can be constructively revised.


Computer vs.         Some simple statistical analyses may be performed manually. However, a
manual data analysis computer statistical analysis package allows powerful statistical analyses
                     to be performed to analyze evaluation results. Although you will probably
                     use a computer package to perform statistical analysis, this section of the
                     handbook will cover how to manually conduct some of these analyses so
                     you understand the reasons why certain analyses are performed and how
                     they are performed.


Determining            The Air Force uses criterion-referenced testing. It is the most reliable
mastery learning       method because it compares trainee performance to some clearly defined
                       criterion for mastery (i.e., objective based on job performance
                       requirement). In criterion-referenced testing, a trainee is given a score of
                       mastery (pass) or of nonmastery (fail). For example, the academic written
                       test within BMT requires a score of 70% to pass the test.


Types of data          There are two types of data collected, which affect how analysis and
                       interpretation of the data will be performed.


Quantitative data      Quantitative data are objective in nature and characterized by generating
                       numbers that are suitable for analysis by comparison measures.
                       Quantitative data are gathered by written and performance tests and focus
                       on observable behavior.


Qualitative data       Qualitative data are subjective in nature and focus on opinions or concepts
                       rather than measurable facts. Qualitative data are gathered by survey
                       questionnaire, interviews, and observation .
AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003                                                                         211



Quantifying         Most data can be quantified, that is, assigned a number. Quantifying
evaluation data     evaluation data allows numbers to be assigned and comparisons of
                    statistical analysis to be performed to analyze and interpret the data.


Written tests       Quantitative written test data come from written test items (e.g.,
                    multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, true/false). These data can be analyzed
                    by assigning a value of '1' to a correct answer and a '0' to an incorrect
                    answer. Matching and listing types of test questions can assign each
                    selection a point value so credit is given to partially correct answers. The
                    test item scores for each trainee can then be summed to produce a total
                    written test score for each trainee.

Performance tests   Performance tests typically have a checklist the evaluator completes
                    during or following observation of trainee performance. These checklists
                    typically evaluate performance of a task on a pass/fail basis. Each task or
                    subtask on a performance checklist may be quantified by assigning a '1' to
                    a passed item and a '0' to a failed item. Scores can then be summed to
                    produce a total performance test score for each trainee.

Survey data   Responses to open-ended survey questions can not be quantified. Because
              the range of responses can vary so greatly, it is not possible to assign a
              specific number to responses.

              Survey questions using a rating scale may be quantified by assigning a
              number to each response if responses range across a continuum. For
              example:

              The organization of the instruction was:

              _____ very helpful
              _____ helpful
              _____ not very helpful

              A ‘1’, ‘2’, and ‘3’ may be assigned to each response (1=not very helpful,
              2=helpful, 3=very helpful). An average score representing the average
              response to the question may then be calculated: Add the ratings for all
              responses to the question and divide by the total number of trainees
              responding to the question. For example, upon analyzing the data, the
              mean value of class responses was 2.8, indicating an overall impression
              that the organization of instruction was very helpful.

Descriptive   Descriptive statistics are basic statistics that are useful for explaining
statistics    results, making comparisons, and looking for trends. Often, when
              reporting results, you will use descriptive statistics.
              Some useful descriptive statistics follow.

Descriptive
statistics       Frequency    Frequency is determined by counting the number of
(Continued)                   occurrences. Frequencies may be used to report:

                                The number of trainees who obtained a particular
                                score on a test or who got a particular test question
                                correct.

                                The number of respondents who answered 'a' on a
                                particular test question.

                                The number of people who completed a survey
                                questionnaire. For example, you may report that
                                281 academic instructors completed a survey out
                                of the total population of 367 who received the
                                survey.


                 Percentage   A percentage is calculated by dividing a subset
                              number of occurrences from the total number of
                              occurrences. Percentages may be used to report:

                                The percentage of trainees who passed a test and
                                the percentage who failed.

                                The percentage of people who answered 'a' on a

                                The percentage of trainees who rated
                                their attitude of BMT as 'highly favorable'.

                                The percentage of people who completed a survey
                                questionnaire. For example, you may report that
                                76.5% of academic instructors completed surveys
                                by dividing the subset (281 who completed
                                survey) by the total population (367 who received
                                survey).

statistics                                 or below. It is useful for determining a "breaking
(Continued)                                score" which splits the class in half.


                     Mean                  Mean is the average of all scores or responses. Mean
                                           is calculated by adding all of the scores or responses
                                           and dividing this by the number of trainees or
                                           respondents. Mean may be used to report:

                                             The average score on a test.

                                             The average response to a rating scale question on

                                             The average rating of BMT graduates.




Test version data    More than one version of a written test must be maintained -- one primary
                     version and at least one version for retesting trainees who fail. Different
                     versions of tests must be compared to ensure they measure the same
                     objectives. Compare average (mean) scores of different test versions to
                     ensure trainees are not having difficulty with one test version over another.


Test item analysis   Item analysis is a set of methods used to evaluate the effectiveness of test
                     items. The analysis of trainee test scores can reveal much about a training
                     program's effectiveness and can indicate a need to evaluate one or more
                     aspects of the program. The 737 TRSS Course Evaluation Element
                     (TSDE) performs a complete test item analysis of BMT academic written
                     tests on a monthly basis. The basic method of item analysis involves an
                     assessment of test item difficulty and discriminability.
AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003                                                                            215


Item difficulty   Item difficulty is the number of trainees who get a particular test item
                  correct, generally expressed in a percentage (e.g., if 20 out of 100 trainees
                  answer the item correctly, the difficulty level is .20 or 20%).

                     number of trainees who get item correct = item difficulty
                  total number of trainees who answered item

                  The more trainees who get the test item correct, the higher the percentage,
                  and the easier the test item; the more trainees who get the item incorrect,
                  the harder the test item (high miss). If the difficultly level is close to 1 (too
                  easy) or to 0 (too hard), the test item should be altered or discarded
                  because it is not testing the differences among test takers' abilities or
                  knowledge. A difficulty level of .50 truly discriminates among test takers
                  with different skill levels. However, the difficulty level will depend on the
                  type of test item being used. Probability of answering a test question by
                  guessing must be figured into the equation. The table below presents
                  acceptable item difficulty values for different test item types.

                                               Test Item Difficulty
                                                       If the item difficulty value falls within
                  Test Item Type

                  One-answer item (e.g.,                                 .30 - .70
                  fill-in-the-blank)

Item               Another way to evaluate test items is to examine the relationship between
Discriminability   performance on individual test items and performance on the whole test.
                   This is known as discriminability. This assessment will determine if
                   trainees who have done well on specific test items have done well on the
                   whole test. It provides a comparison between trainees who have done well
                   on the test with trainees who have not done well.

                   For example, test scores of trainees in the top 25% of the class can be
                   compared with scores from the bottom 25% of the class. (The percentage
                   chosen for evaluation can be anywhere between 10% and 33%.) The
                   difference between these proportions of high scoring and low scoring
                   trainees is the discrimination index. To perform item discriminability:

                   1. Identify the % of trainees in the high scoring group (top 25% of class)
                   and the % in the low scoring group who got a particular test item correct.

                   2. For each test item, subtract the % of correct responses for the low
                   scoring group (L) from the % of correct responses for the high scoring
                   group (H). This gives the item discriminability (D).


                         Item #     H - L       =      D
                            1     .89 .34            .55
                            2     .76 .36            .40
                            3     .98 .45            .53
                            4     .98 .88            .10
                            5     .56 .74           -.18

                                       Interpreting Item Discriminability:
                      If the value is between:                    Interpret as:
                              .50 - 1.00                        Very good item
                               .30 - .49               Reasonably good item but possibly
                                                            subject to improvement
                               .10 - .29              Marginal item needing improvement
                           negative value                          Poor item

Trend analysis   Analysis of data can reveal patterns or themes that emerge over time.
                 These trends should be assessed to determine if there are significant
                 reasons why these patterns keep showing up. A trend can focus subsequent
                 evaluations of a particular topic to determine solutions to improve the
                 training program.

                   Data from surveys can reveal trends such as a particular response to an
                   open-ended question reported by many respondents.

                   Data gathered over time (e.g., several evolutions of a training program
                   or survey questionnaire) can reveal trends. These data can include
                   information on the effectiveness of training materials, test items, trainee
                   recycle and elimination rates, and ratings of BMT graduates.

                   Data gathered for one topic from many sources can also show trends.
                   These types of data include information collected from many different
                   sources on the effectiveness of instructor performance, course materials,
                   training environment, and trainee performance .

                   Data gathered from one source (e.g., one trainee's responses to a written
                   test or survey) may also indicate trends that you should be aware of
                   because they will affect your analysis of the data:

                     Halo effect - indiscriminate rating of all items positively. This is
                     generally seen on responses to survey questions.

                     Central tendency - indiscriminate rating of items in the center of the
                     scale. This may be seen on responses to survey questions or written
                     tests.

                               Report Evaluation Results


Introduction        After completing data analysis, you must report your findings. You may
                    provide results in the form of an Evaluation Report or in a briefing.


Evaluation report   An Evaluation Report or briefing should include information such as:
or briefing
                      Background information on the course that was evaluated.
                      Scope of the evaluation.
                      Significant analysis results.
                      Specific recommendations for improving the program.
                      Milestones for corrective actions, if applicable.


BMT Review          If recommended revisions to the training materials or program do not
                    require immediate implementation, the 737 TRSS Course Development
                    Element (TSDC) will hold recommendations for consideration until the
                    next BMT Review. TSDC will report suggested curriculum changes and
                    updates to the BMT Review Committee to include the following :

Reporting via    Qualitative data, such as those gathered through open-ended survey
narrative text   questionnaires and observations, are generally summarized in paragraph
                 form. However, quantitative data may also be reported via narrative text.
                 A concise paragraph should focus on what was evaluated and why, and it
                 should describe the findings of the evaluation and, if possible,
                 recommendations for future action. For example:

                   Of 235 trainees surveyed, 187 felt their BMT experience was
                   'favorable'.

                   85% of BMT graduates demonstrate the Air Force's three core values.

                   80 out of 100 trainees passed the written test.

                   80% of trainees passed the written test.


Reporting via    Quantitative data, such as test scores, can best be summarized in graphic
graphs           form. Survey data may also be 'quantified' by assigning numbers, ratings,
                 and percentages to the data. Some examples follow.


                 % of trainees rating BMT as 'highly
                 favorable/favorable', by quarter:

Reporting via tables Quantitative data, such as test scores, are also effectively summarized in
                     tables. An example follows.

Revising the
training program   Any revisions to BMT curriculum must be approved by 737/TRG/CC.
                   Once any revisions identified by the evaluation are approved, you must
                   correct the deficiencies in the program. Revisions resulting from
                   evaluation may require reentry into an earlier phase of the ISD process to
                   correct the problem(s). The need to reenter an earlier phase of ISD is
                   determined by the nature and scope of the revision. For example, changing
                   a test item would require you to reenter the Design Phase of ISD.

                                                  Terms

The following list of definitions includes those terms commonly used in Basic Military Training as they
relate to instructional systems development and as used in this handbook. The list is not to be considered
all-inclusive .


Administration Function. Responsible for the maintenance of documents such as equipment, supply,
and trainee records. The administration function should be in place before successfully implementing a
training program.


Attitude. A feeling or emotion toward a fact or state. Attitudes must support Air Force philosophy and
policies for conduct. An attitude is often what is needed to achieve desired outcomes. Also see Knowl-
edge and Skill.


Behavior. The activity the trainee is expected to demonstrate following training. A behavior must be
written in measurable, observable terms so trainee performance can be objectively evaluated.


Computer-Based Training (CBT). A training method that uses computers to aid in the delivery and
management of instruction. CBT, also referred to as interactive courseware (ICW), involves trainees
interacting, at their own pace, to instruction presented through a variety of media controlled and moni-
tored by a computer.


Condition. Conditions set forth the real-world or wartime circumstances in which the task is to be per-
formed. Conditions describe the situation, equipment, and resources needed to perform the task on the
job and the assistance, location, safety considerations, etc., that relate to performance of the task.


Course Chart. A qualitative course control document that states the course identity, length, and security
classification, lists major items of training equipment, and summarizes the subject matter covered .


Course Control Documents. Specialized publications used to control the quality of the training pro-
gram. Examples are training standards, plans of instruction, and course charts.


Course Training Plan (CTP). A document that provides the basis for planning, programming, and
implementing training. It is the justification that describes the training program in terms of purpose, type
of training, training design, training content, course parameters, and resources required.
AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003                                                                             227


Course Training Standard (CTS). A document that indicates the learning outcome and level of learning
required for each standard. A Proficiency Code Key explains these relationships.


Criterion. (a) The standard by which something is measured. (b) In test validation, the standard against
which test instruments are correlated to indicate that accuracy with which they predict human perfor-
mance in some specified area. (c) In evaluation, the measure used to determine the adequacy of a product,
process, behavior, and other conditions.


Criterion Referenced Testing. Measures knowledge objectives, knowledge components of performance
objectives, and performance objectives in sufficient quantity to provide an acceptable degree of confi-
dence that the trainees have attained the required knowledge and skills. To ensure tests adequately mea-
sure objectives, the performance required in the test should match the performance required in the
objective.


Demonstration. A training method that uses the presentation or portrayal of a sequence of events to dem-
onstrate a procedure, technique, or operation; frequently used in conjunction with lecture. Demonstra-
tions may include presentations of models, videos, maps, or a live demonstration by an instructor.


Educational Analysis. The process of reviewing educational requirements and developing educational
goals .


Enabling Objective. An objective that trainees must attain in order to accomplish a terminal objective.
Enabling objectives provide the level of detail necessary to describe the knowledge and skills that must be
learned to demonstrate satisfactory performance of the terminal objective.


Evaluation. Procedure used to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of a training program to
include the training materials, training setting, and performance of trainees, instructors, and graduates.
Evaluation is a continuous process throughout each phase of ISD. It includes Formative Evaluation, Sum-
mative Evaluation, and Operational Evaluation.


External Evaluation. A process used to evaluate a training program externally from the field through
survey questionnaires and inspection and evaluation reports. The focus of this evaluation is on identify-
ing whether graduates are meeting established job performance requirements .


Formative Evaluation. An evaluation method used to validate training materials prior to implementing
the program. Formative evaluation is conducted during the development or revision of a training pro-
gram. Within BMT, formative evaluation consists of technical accuracy reviews of the training materials.
228                                                                     AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003


Guided Discussion. A training method that uses instructor-led interactions that involve participation by
all trainees through a variety of exercises such as case study and role-playing. It is highly effective for
analyzing, debating, exploring a topic, value, or attitude.


Instructional Systems Development (ISD). A deliberate and orderly, but flexible, process for planning,
analyzing, designing, developing, implementing, and evaluating training programs. ISD ensures person-
nel are taught in a cost-efficient manner the skills, knowledge, and attitudes essential for successful job
performance.


Intellectual Skills. Intellectual skills involve identifying, classifying, categorizing, using rules, solving
problems, thinking, reasoning, analyzing, discriminating, evaluating, and judging.


Interactive Courseware (ICW). Computer-controlled training designed to allow the student to interact
with the learning environment through input devices such as keyboards and light pens. The student's
decisions and inputs to the computer determine the level, order, and pace of instructional delivery, and
forms of visual and aural outputs.


Internal Evaluation. A process used to evaluate a training program internally through instructor com-
ments, trainee critiques, and test results. The focus of this evaluation is on identifying revisions that may
be made to improve the program.


Job Aid. A checklist, procedural guide, worksheet, or other device used by the worker to aid in task per-
formance. Job aids reduce the amount of information that personnel must recall or retain.


Knowledge. The information required to develop the skills and attitudes for effective accomplishment of
a step, task, or job. Knowledge involves storing and recalling information such as names, labels, facts,
principles, nomenclature, steps, etc.


Learning. A change in the behavior of the learner as a result of experience. The behavior can be physical
and overt, or it can be intellectual or attitudinal .


Learning Analysis. The process of analyzing the real-world tasks performed on the job and translating
them into behaviors performed in the training environment. Learning analysis involves establishing
learning outcomes in terms of types of learning involved and level of learning desired.


Learning Objective. A statement that defines the real-world task behaviors and knowledge modified to
fit the training environment, that describe precisely what the trainee is expected to do, under specified
AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003                                                                              229


conditions, and to a specified standard. A learning objective is stated in terms of what trainees must be
able to do at the end of training.


Lecture. A formal or semiformal oral presentation of information delivered by an instructor. Primarily
used to impart verbal information and intellectual skills such as facts, concepts, problems, relationships,
rules, and principles .


Lesson Plan. An approved plan for instruction that provides specific definition and direction to the
instructor on learning objectives, equipment, instructional media material requirements, and conduct of
training.


Media. The means used to communicate information. Media are selected to enhance, support, and sup-
plement presentation of the instruction. Media can improve trainee attention during training and increase
transfer of learning.


Motor Skills. Learned behaviors that involve the smooth coordinated use of muscles. Motor skills
involve the performance of some activity that is directly observable.


Needs Analysis. The process of analyzing a need, problem, or deficiency in order to determine if the
solution is training or non-training related.


Objective. A statement that specifies precisely what behavior is to be exhibited during training, the con-
ditions under which behavior will be accomplished, and the minimum standard of performance. Objec-
tives describe only the behaviors that directly lead to or specifically satisfy a job performance
requirement.


Operational Evaluation. A continuous process after course implementation that assesses how well
course graduates are meeting established job performance requirements.


Operational (Field) Tryout. A review in which training materials are presented to the actual target audi-
ence under normal operating conditions to identify inaccuracies and weaknesses in the materials. See also
Summative Evaluation.


Performance Test. A test in which the trainee actually performs the skill required of the objective. A
performance test is used to evaluate a performance objective.
230                                                                   AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003


Plan of Instruction (POI). The overall plan or blueprint for conducting training in a given course. POIs
ensure training is standardized. The POI serves as a control document for planning, organizing, and con-
ducting training.


Practical Application. A training method in which trainees apply previously learned knowledge or skills
under controlled conditions with close instructor supervision. Trainees may interact with equipment,
data, or persons, as necessary, to attain training objectives. This includes interaction with actual equip-
ment or job materials.


Qualitative Data. Data that are subjective in nature and focus on opinions or concepts rather than mea-
surable facts. Qualitative data are gathered by survey questionnaire, interviews, and observation.


Quantitative Data. Data that are objective in nature and characterized by generating numbers that are
suitable for analysis by comparison measures. Quantitative data are gathered by written and performance
tests and focus on observable behavior.
Resources. The supplies and support required to revise, design, develop, implement, and maintain a
training program.


Self Study. A training method in which trainees review and study instructional materials designed for this
purpose at their own pace.


Skill. The ability to perform a job-related activity that contributes to the effective accomplishment of a
step or job.


Standard. Standards provide the proficiency level expected when the task is performed. The standard
can cite a technical manual or doctrinal reference, or the standard can be defined in terms of complete-
ness, time, and accuracy. It identifies the proficiency trainees must achieve when they perform the behav-
ior under the specified conditions .


Subject Matter Expert (SME). (a) An individual who has thorough knowledge of a job, duties/tasks, or
a particular topic, which qualifies him/her to assist in the training development process (for example, to
consult, review, analyze, advise, or critique). (b) A person who has high-level knowledge and skill in the
performance of a job.


Subtask. The groupings of work activities that, when combined, make up a task. Subtasks, or perfor-
mance steps, specify the actions required to accomplish a task. They may also be defined as a series of
actions leading to a terminal outcome.
AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003                                                                                 231


Summative Evaluation. An evaluation method used to try out the instruction on the target audience in
an operational environment. Within BMT, summative evaluation consists of operational field tryouts
conducted on selected flights currently undergoing BMT to determine the "summed" effect of the instruc-
tion under operational conditions.


Support Function. The long-range as well as day-to-day tasks performed by training support organiza-
tions to implement and maintain the training program.


Target Audience. The total collection of possible users of a given training program. The persons for
whom the training program is designed.


Task. An observable and measurable unit of work activity or operation that forms a significant part of a
job. It constitutes a logical and necessary step in performance, and has a logical beginning and end.


Task Analysis. The process of breaking down tasks into subtasks (performance steps), conditions, and
standards.


Tasking. Any formal request to develop new training or revise existing training.


Technical Accuracy Review. A review conducted to identify inaccuracies and weaknesses in training
materials under review so they may be corrected. Also see Validation .


Terminal Objective. An objective that trainees will be expected to accomplish when they have com-
pleted the instruction. It may be supported by several enabling objectives.


Training. A set of events or activities presented in a structured or planned manner, through one or more
media, for the attainment and retention of skills, knowledge, and attitudes required to meet job perfor-
mance requirements.


Training Needs Assessment (TNA). The process of identifying a deficiency or gap between current per-
formance and desired performance.


Transfer of Learning. The extent to which what is trained is carried over to the job. Training should
strive to provide as realistic conditions as possible to the job to increase trainee retention of the material
and maximize transfer of learning.
232                                                                  AFH36-2235V1 6 AUGUST 2003


Validation. The assessment of the effectiveness of instruction while it is being developed with the inten-
tion of improving it. It is a process of repetitive cycles of development, tryouts, and revision until evi-
dence shows that the instruction is effective. Validation is conducted to ensure materials train and
measure those skills and knowledge necessary for job performance.


Verbal Information. The required information to develop the skills and attitudes for effective accom-
plishment of a step or task. Verbal information involves storing and recalling information and refers to
the learning and recall of names, labels, facts, nomenclature, etc. The learning of knowledge is imparted
through verbal information .


Written Test. A test that evaluates a trainee's knowledge of a subject. A written test is used to evaluate
a knowledge objective.
