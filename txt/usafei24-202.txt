SUMMARY OF CHANGES
 2                                                              USAFEI24-202 4 APRIL 2014


This instruction was substantially revised and must be thoroughly reviewed.
1. Overview. ACAs represent Department of Defense (DOD) interests and support all Defense
Transportation System (DTS) users entering or transitioning their region through cargo
advancement and quality control. They are the single point of contact between the aerial port and
the shipping agency for clearing cargo into the DTS. ACAs are concerned with efficient,
effective, and economic cargo movement. This instruction outlines specific responsibilities that
each ACA must perform. See Attachment 1 for a glossary of references and supporting
information.
2. ACA Roles and Responsibilities:
     2.1. Control the movement of originating cargo into the Aerial Port of Embarkation (APOE).
        2.1.1. Establish a dedicated e-mail address (organization e-mail address) for all ACA
        correspondence.
        2.1.2. Compile historical data as required by the HQ USAFE Transportation Policy
        Branch (HQ USAFE/A4RT). Examples of data include, but are not limited to: tracer
        actions performed, Advance Transportation Control and Movement Documents
        (ATCMD) processed, green sheet requests processed, quantity of ammunition and
        explosives cleared, and modal decisions/cargo diverts.
     2.2. Clear all air-eligible cargo entering the defense transportation system, except cargo
     moving on special assignment airlift missions, training and unit missions, Code-J
     Unaccompanied Baggage, Air Mobility Command (AMC) Forward Supply Support cargo
     and US Mail. Clearance will be based on cargo movement regulations and policy messages,
     service and DLA provided challenge criteria, available airlift, air terminal cargo backlogs,
     compatibility or storage, and projected requirements.
     2.3. ACAs will coordinate with aerial port management and shippers to develop a plan to
     control the flow of deferred air freight (TP-4) into the airlift system.
        2.3.1. As outlined in AMCI 24-101, Vol 11, Cargo and Mail Policy, AMC air freight
        officers will establish acceptable on-hand TP-4 levels based upon the excess space
        estimates, port processing constraints, historical airlift utilization, and known future
        uncommitted space. TP-4 will not be allowed to free-flow into the port. The air freight
        officer must ensure movement capability exists to the final APOD.
        2.3.2. If accepted for movement, TP-4 cargo will be kept on hand for 20 calendar days.
        After that time, aerial ports will frustrate the cargo and work with the ACA, and in-turn
        with the shipper, to divert the cargo for movement by other means or upgrade the cargo
        to TP-2. Upgrade TP-4 cargo by coordination with the collocated AMC aerial port
        officer; this process must be accomplished in no more than 2 duty days. If cargo is
        diverted to another mode of transportation, ACA will document diversion actions using a
        cargo diversion letter. Note: Upgrading cargo may incur additional transportation cost
        depending on USTRANSCOM’s current billing policies. If additional cost is incurred,
        then Joint Personal Property Shipping Office-San Antonio TX (JPPSO-SAT) must
        approve the upgrade of all household goods. If the upgrade is not approved, AMC must
        keep the shipment in the system as TP-4 unless Traffic Management Division (AF/A4LE)
        approves diverting the cargo to another mode (i.e., Code 4, 5). Refer to Air Force
USAFEI24-202 4 APRIL 2014                                                                     3


     Supplements to Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), Volume 1, Uniformed Service
     Members.
  2.4. All ACA personnel must obtain certification as a Hazardous Materials Inspector, as a
  minimum, and maintain currency every 2 years.
     2.4.1. Review Shippers Declarations for Dangerous Goods (SDDG) (AMC Form 1033,
     Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods or approved standard commercial form as
     outlined in AFMAN 24-204_IP, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air
     Shipments) for all applicable hazardous cargo shipments offered for airlift. SDDGs not
     properly prepared in accordance with AFMAN 24-204 or International Air Transport
     Association (IATA) will be returned to the shipping agency for corrections and will not
     be cleared for airlift until identified corrections are received.
     2.4.2. Arrange for diversion of cargo from air to surface when aerial port storage is
     saturated or when other reasons dictate. All concerned agencies will be notified of
     diversions. The local Port Movement Control Team (PMCT) or Traffic Management
     Office will receive diverted cargo for preparation of documentation and onward surface
     movement.
  2.5. Enforce the use of Financial and Air Clearance Transportation System (FACTS) in
  accordance with (IAW) DOD 4500.9-R, Part II, Defense Transportation Regulation – Cargo
  Movement, Chapter 202.
     2.5.1. Monitor and assist shipper in resolving discrepancies for shipments of all services
     with incomplete or missing trailer data (BK status) and on shipments captured in the
     FACTS exception file.
     2.5.2. Periodically check the “un-cleared shipments” within FACTS for shipments in a
     status of challenge, hold, etc. Inform shippers of status and advise on required corrective
     action(s). A justification letter via e-mail is required to ship cargo when challenged by
     FACTS. If a justification letter is not received within 3 days after the booking date, the
     shipment will be automatically diverted to surface.
     2.5.3. Ensure applicable Movement Authorization Management (MAM) rules are loaded
     in FACTS to challenge, hold or divert shipments that do not meet requirements for air
     movement.
     2.5.4. Advise shippers to work with their servicing transportation office for FACTS
     input. Air Force shippers will work through their local Traffic Management Office
     (TMO); Army shippers through the Battalion Movement Control Team (BMCT);
     Contractors through the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA); non-DoD
     users will be handled on a case-by-case basis until FACTS access can be obtained.
  2.6. Provide tracer actions upon request. Shippers should first use Integrated Development
  Environment (IDE)/Global Transportation Network (GTN) Convergence (IGC) at
  https://www.igc.ustranscom.mil/igc/. For new users, click on Account Request to obtain
  access.
  2.7. Expedite onward movement of high priority and explosive shipments.
     2.7.1. Coordinate with collocated AMC aerial port, capability forecasting, and intransit
     munitions on local procedures for clearing ammunition and explosive shipments.
4                                                               USAFEI24-202 4 APRIL 2014


       2.7.2. The Ramstein Airlift Clearance Authority will track all originating explosive
       shipments and distinguish between shipments offered for airlift and shipments cleared to
       be called forward. Coordinate with capability forecasting and aerial port intransit
       munitions facility. The Royal Air Force (RAF) Mildenhall Airlift Clearance Authority
       will liaise with the shipper, TMO, and local Air Mobility Command operation to
       establish a delivery date once valid documentation is made available.
       2.7.3. Ensure the following shipping documents are provided and accurate: shipper’s
       declaration for dangerous goods (AMC Form 1033 or approved standard commercial
       form as outlined in AFMAN 24-204_IP, Transportation Control and Movement
       Document (TCMD) (DD Form 1384, Transportation Control and Movement Document)
       or Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS) manifest, and any applicable Interim
       Hazard Class (IHC)/Joint Hazard Classification System (JHCS) letters.
       2.7.4. Provide clear and concise written communication via e-mail to all affected
       agencies (capability forecasting, intransit munitions, shipper, servicing transportation
       agency and all ACA personnel, etc.).
       2.7.5. If the ACA determines a shipment will not meet the Required Delivery Date
       (RDD), they will use priority upgrades, assist user to “space block” through the Offshore
       Cargo Bookies at the Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC), as outlined in Air Mobility
       Command Instruction (AMCI) 24-101 Volume 9, Air Terminal Operations Center, or
       Green Sheet as required. The ACA will provide status updates, as requested, by the
       consignor, consignee, or the tasking authority. If the RDD will not be met, ACA will
       notify the tasking authority and the consignee of the expected delivery date and current
       shipment status.
    2.8. Assist collocated aerial port in resolving cargo processing issues such as: “no-hit”
    Transportation Control Numbers (TCN), invalid Transportation Account Code (TAC) codes,
    and invalid Department of Defense Activity Address Codes (DODAAC) for originating and
    intransit shipments.
       2.8.1. Periodically check the Cargo Advances menu in the Global Air Transportation
       Execution System (GATES) for shipments containing errors.
       2.8.2. Add missing shipment trailer data and other missing data as required.
    2.9. Act as the focal point for shippers requesting expedited cargo movement. Upon
    receiving a request for Green Sheet action, the regional ACA will perform the following:
       2.9.1. Determine validity and need of request.
       2.9.2. Determine if channel airlift, add-on, or unscheduled airlift can satisfy the request
       with the current priority and system entry time.
       2.9.3. Coordinate Green Sheet action with the AMC load-planning section (see
       Attachment 2).
       2.9.4. Track shipments until the cargo has reached its destination and provide status
       updates to the requesting office.
USAFEI24-202 4 APRIL 2014                                                                       5


   2.10. Upon receipt or generation of AMC Form 33, Report of Frustrated Cargo, for
   originating cargo, verify the accuracy and completeness of the report. The ACA will initiate
   the following actions:
      2.10.1. Notify the shipper that the shipment has been frustrated, and work to correct the
      discrepancy.
      2.10.2. Return frustrated originating cargo, which cannot be corrected by ACA, to the
      shipper as a last resort. Make every effort to correct the problem before it is returned to
      the shipper.
3. Shipper Roles and Responsibilities:
   3.1. Obtain airlift clearance, to include air eligible cargo shipped to a consolidation and
   containerization point (CCP), by submitting shipment information into FACTS to include
   data elements from DD Form 1384 for all shipments except cargo moving on special
   assignment airlift missions, training and unit missions, Code-J Unaccompanied Baggage, Air
   Mobility Command (AMC) Forward Supply Support cargo and US Mail. For FACTS
   account access, call DSN 312-430-6122 or commercial 1-855-628-3375 or navigate to
   navsup@mtihelpdesk.com.
   3.2. Release cargo to the aerial port only after the ACA has cleared the shipment.
      3.2.1. Ensure configuration of cargo does not change from that initially advanced to the
      ACA. Any cargo configuration changes will result in termination of the clearance.
   3.3. Take primary responsibility to correct all shipment discrepancies discovered by aerial
   port and ACA personnel.
4. Wartime and Contingency Responsibilities:
   4.1. Additional Aerial Ports of Debarkation/Embarkation may be established during wartime
   or contingencies. The established regional ACA will be responsible for any additional aerial
   ports within their region. HQ USAFE/A4RT will provide augmentation as required as well
   as coordinate with the Joint Task Force/J-4 to augment the existing regional ACA with
   additional personnel as required.

                                GREEN SHEET PROCEDURES

A2.1. Overview. Expedite cargo through use of green sheet procedures. Green Sheet approval
is the exception, not the rule. Priority 1 (999) cargo should not typically require green sheeting.
Green Sheet is not a priority but is designed to override the priorities when expedited movement
of specific shipments is required in the national interest and is certified as an operational
necessity (e.g., Presidential support, life and death, search and rescue, critical mission support).
When deemed necessary, such cargo may gain movement precedence over other expedited
cargo, including 999 shipments of the sponsoring service, through use of an approved Green
Sheet request. Do not approve green sheet if other procedures, including space block, will meet
the movement requirement. However, any action to disrupt the normal flow of cargo by priority
and age should be taken with extreme caution and only after a thorough consideration of shipper
justification and airlift availability.
A2.2. Limitations. Green sheet procedures will pertain to only those items already in the port
backlog. Do not bump through load shipments from other APOEs.
A2.3. Reference. DOD 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation and AFI 24-203,
Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo outline green sheet procedures. Use the
following additional procedures to ensure careful control of the system:
     A2.3.1. Requests for expediting cargo may be received from any transportation source and
     may be reported by telephone and confirmed in writing. With the exception of requests
     involving task forces, green sheet requests must be submitted via a memorandum or e-mail
     signed/sent by an 0-6 or civilian equivalent. For requests involving task forces, the task force
     G-4, or in the absence of the task force G-4, the senior task force logistician may sign/send
     the request. A full signature block to include name, rank, and duty title of the requesting
     official is required. The request must include complete justification of why shipment is a
     national interest of the United States and is certified as an operational necessity. The request
     will include the shipment TCN and a 24-hour point of contact who can answer questions
     concerning the shipment. Work stoppage of non-critical activities does not warrant green
     sheeting for low priority cargo.
     A2.3.2. The ACA will evaluate the requester’s justification for green sheet action for
     movement on strategic AMC airlift. If warranted, the ACA will forward and coordinate with
     the aerial port for further action. Contact the aerial port load planning section to determine
     expected movement date with or without green sheet action initiated. Consider any
     additional factors which may impact on the shipment movement, and, if warranted, the ACA
     prepares and submits an AMC Form 101, Green Sheet Request to the load planning section.
     AMC Form 101 will be numbered for tracking purposes. Use one AMC Form 101 per
     transportation control number (TCN).
     A2.3.3. Closely monitor the shipment until actual departure has been achieved.             File
     disapproved green sheet requests with an explanation of the refusal.
     A2.3.4. When notified by the APOE, Purple Sheet actions will be processed IAW Defense
     Transportation Regulation, Part II, Chapter 203.
