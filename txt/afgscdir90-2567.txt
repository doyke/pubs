1. General.
1.1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists (C&SRLs) are the primary lists used
during the HQ AFGSC/IG Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI) to access unit compliance with
established guidance governing each particular area of operations. C&SRL items are defined
by the AFGSC staff and based upon existing “by-law” requirements, Executive Orders, DoD
directives, AF and AFGSC instructions, and mission areas deemed critical by AF or AFGSC
leadership to assessing and assuring unit organizational health and/or performance. The
objective of the C&SRL is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required
capabilities.
1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCOs) represent the highest priority of inspection items
and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Area (CCCAs) and the
thirteen missions areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower tier Core and
General Compliance Items may be stand alone or subordinate to a CCO. During the UCI, it is
the intent of the AFGSC/IG to inspect, as a minimum, 100% of the CCOs that apply to the
inspected unit. However, C&SRL items listed do not limit the scope of the inspection. Critical,
core and general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). An item where a unit failure to comply with
established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or serious injury or
significant mission impact. Key mission areas are:
- Airman development programs
- Ability to deploy forces
- Ability to employ forces
NOTE: CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An item or area that requires special vigilance and is
important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical." Non-compliance
would result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result in injury or
possible litigation. CCIs are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT.
1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to successful
overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal impact on mission
accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible litigation. GCIs are shown in
sentence case format.
