     authority and responsibility for actions taken during the emergency incident. All personnel
     operating within the incident scene report to the IC. Additionally, the IC has the sole
     authority to terminate a Ground (GE) or In-Flight Emergency (IFE) response.
     1.3. The on-scene weapons supervisor (7-level) will ensure all personnel comply with

     and direct personnel action as necessary after consultation and approval from the IC.
     1.4. Once briefed, the weapons supervisor will ensure all provisions of the applicable
     hot/jammed guns or hung ordnance technical order are followed.
     1.5. If the weapons supervisor determines the munitions and weapons systems are safe and
     can be removed using normal maintenance procedures, weapons personnel will proceed with
     clearing procedures in accordance with (IAW) the appropriate Technical Orders.
     1.6. If the weapons supervisor determines the munitions are armed, suspected of being
     armed, condition unknown, or damaged, the operation will be turned over to EOD. All
     nonessential personnel will evacuate the area to the applicable distance for munitions loaded
     IAW AFI91-201, paragraph 10.10 and 10.12.
     1.7. The weapons supervisor will keep the IC informed as to the condition of the hot/jammed
     gun or hung ordnance and actions required or taken. The IC will notify Fire Alarm

     ordnance, MOCC personnel will initiate the applicable checklist. EOD can be contacted
     through the Command Post 24 hours a day.
     2.4. In case of fire, weapons personnel will attempt to fight the fire and remove munitions if
     possible.
     2.5. If munitions become engulfed in flames, evacuate all personnel to a minimum safe

     unknown. The IC will inform MOCC to terminate the IFE for the aircraft and will initiate a
     ground emergency for the hot/jammed gun.
     10.7. The weapons supervisor will proceed with clearing procedures IAW appropriate
     Technical Orders. Once the hot/jammed ammo is removed the weapons supervisor will
     inform the IC that the gun is now clear of ammo and the area is safe.

     from the aircraft. A minimum of 2 weapons personnel will respond to assess the issue once
     the proper shutdown procedures are followed. At no time will weapons personnel perform
     maintenance on a running aircraft for a hang/misfired malfunction.
     11.2. Aircraft will follow normal recovery procedures to include shutdown in the designated
     active EOR area, see Attachment 2.
