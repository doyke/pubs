                                             Chapter 1

                              GENERAL PURPOSE AND SCOPE

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of the Logistics Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP) is to
provide leadership at all levels with an evaluation of a unit’s ability to perform key logistics
processes in a safe, standardized, repeatable, and technically compliant manner. Major
Commands (MAJCOM) will conduct LCAP evaluations at subordinate units to assess their
proficiency in key logistics processes. This AFI standardizes the LCAP breadth, depth,
frequency, grading, and reporting requirements. The LCAP is focused on evaluating the
effectiveness of personnel and logistics processes. The LCAP will:
     1.1.1. Evaluate units across the entire logistics enterprise to a common Air Force standard.
     1.1.2. Establish oversight, evaluation, and internal audit processes to effectively identify,
     prevent, and resolve deficiencies. It will also identify issues which are beyond the unit’s
     control that require higher headquarters resolution.
     1.1.3. Establish a robust trend review, comprehensive causal analysis, and open sharing of
     lessons learned across all units.
     1.1.4. Establish standard AF functional checklists across the logistics enterprise focused on
     personnel proficiency and process effectiveness.
1.2. Scope. The LCAP applies to AF units performing duties across the full spectrum of
logistics. This includes conventional force logistics units; nuclear and nuclear support units;
cyber and space; special operations; wholesale-level procurement, sustainment, and
maintenance; aerial port squadrons; logistics readiness squadrons; logistics support to research,
test, and development units; and logistics support to special access programs. It does not include
medical logistics, civil engineering logistics, security forces units, communications units, and
pre-award contracting functions.
     1.2.1. The overlap in scope between LCAP evaluations and Inspector General (IG)
     Inspections (i.e., Unit Compliance Inspections (UCIs)) will be minimized to the maximum
     extent practical. LCAP evaluations focus heavily on personnel proficiency to verify
     compliance with established policy and procedures. However, it is possible to have some
     duplication especially in functional areas that are more process oriented versus task oriented.
        1.2.1.1. When LCAP evaluations are conducted simultaneously with UCIs the LCAP
        evaluation will remain a separate entity. All provisions of this AFI shall apply.
        1.2.1.2. LCAP evaluations will not be conducted simultaneously with Nuclear Surety
        Inspections (NSI).
1.3. Logistics Activities. This instruction provides policy and establishes program requirements
for logistics activities performing the following functions:
     1.3.1. Supply Chain Management Functions. Consists of the end-to-end processes and
     functions of the logistics enterprise which include: Plan; Source; Make and Repair; and
     Deliver and Return.
AFI20-111_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2012                                                           5

     DoD sources. “Source” does not include pre-award and award contracting functions
     resident in base-level contracting squadrons or equivalent organizations.
     1.3.1.3. Make and Repair. Includes all organizations within the wholesale and base-level
     logistics enterprise that conduct activities related to the manufacture and repair of assets
     to support weapon systems. This encompasses organizations that perform generation,
     launch, recovery, ground handling, and servicing of all weapons systems. It includes
     organizations that perform manufacturing, maintenance, repair, calibration, overhaul, or
     inspection of: aircraft, aerospace equipment, aircraft engines, support equipment/tools,
     conventional munitions, nuclear munitions, missiles, vehicles, components, and other
     non-flying weapon systems.
     1.3.1.4. Deliver and Return. Includes all organizations within the wholesale and base-
     level logistics enterprise that process the receipt of orders; automatically source orders
     within the supply chain; and ship, track, and store all materiel, equipment, and
     commodities. This encompasses organizations that provide inventory management,
     distribution, and transportation activities for materiel, equipment, and commodities. It
     includes maintaining Positive Inventory Control (PIC) for all materiel to include Nuclear
     Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM), weapons, classified assets, Controlled
     Cryptographic Item (CCI) and Communication Security (COMSEC) equipment.
  1.3.2. Enablers. Includes all organizations at the wing-level, or equivalent, and below within
  the wholesale and base-level logistics enterprise that provide support to supply chain
  management functions or conduct other logistics activities. Enabling functions include:
     1.3.2.1. Quality Assurance (QA) and Compliance Functions. Includes all organizations
     within the wholesale and base-level logistics enterprise that verify logistics and ensures
     processes are conducted in a safe, standardized, repeatable, and technically compliant
     manner. This function verifies that processes and personnel are meeting or exceeding
     quality standards established by technical orders, instructions, manuals, partnering
     agreements, directives and/or supplements. It includes personnel performing a QA
     function on logistics contractor managed organizations.
     1.3.2.2. Deployment Planning/Execution and Base Support/Expeditionary Site Planning
     Functions. Includes logistics activities responsible for the command, control, planning,
     and execution of unit deployment and redeployment operations in a contingency and
     steady-state environment. It also includes base support, expeditionary site planning, and

          standardized, repeatable, and technically compliant manner.
    1.3.3. Contractor Managed Organizations. Contracted units performing the logistics
    functions described in paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 present unique challenges for conducting
    LCAP evaluations. The following procedures will be followed for Contractor Managed
    Organizations:
       1.3.3.1. The LCAP assessment will be conducted in accordance with (IAW) the contract
       and associate Performance Work Statement (PWS)/Statement of Work (SOW).
       Additionally, the LCAP evaluation shall be conducted in conjunction with the
       Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) and IAW the guidance contained in this
       instruction and governing Quality Assurance directives. NOTE: for the purpose of this
       instruction, COR is synonymous with Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE), contracting
       Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR), and Quality Assurance Representative
       (QAR). Performance Management Assessment Program (PMAP) and Performance Plan
       (P-Plan) are both synonymous with the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).
          1.3.3.1.1. LCAP evaluators conducting direct evaluation of the contracted
          organization must be properly trained in QAE functions and must coordinate closely
          with the COR on all aspects of the evaluation.
       1.3.3.2. If direct evaluation of the contractor managed organization is not permitted by
       the PWS/SOW, then follow the below guidance.
          1.3.3.2.1. Evaluate the contractor’s performance by conducting a joint surveillance
          with the COR and/or examining the COR documentation as compared to the QASP,
          P-Plan or PMAP for that contract.
          1.3.3.2.2. Evaluate that the COR is providing effective oversight of the contract by
          ensuring that the QASP, P-Plan or PMAP is being followed as written, that the
          multifunctional team periodically reviews the plan and initiates modifications to the
          plan when needed, and that it adheres to applicable governing directives.
          1.3.3.2.3. Evaluate the PWS/SOW requirements and service deliverable summary
          objectives against the organizational objectives to ensure they are adequately written
          to satisfy mission requirements.
          1.3.3.2.4. Ensure the Contracting Officer and COR review findings associated with
          contractor performance prior to inclusion in the LCAP Unit Report. NOTE: Only the
          Contracting Officer can take formal action against the contractor for non-compliance
          or direct contractors to correct deficiencies identified during evaluations.

   standard for Air National Guard units given augmentation by the Lead MAJCOMS as
   described in paragraph 2.2.8.2. The Director, ANG, may extend the frequency to a
   maximum of 60 months on a case-by-case basis for special circumstances, including Lead
   MAJCOM or ANG resource limitations that prevent assembling a sufficient LCAP team.
   Approval authority cannot be delegated.
       3.3.3.1. (Added-AFRC) Close coordination between HQ AFRC/A4OI and the unit is
       required to schedule evaluations for subordinate units who do not train on the Wing’s
       primary UTA. Immediately contact HQ AFRC/A4OI (afrc.lcap@us.af.mil) if you
       receive notification of an LCAP that conflicts with your approved UTA schedule.
   3.3.4. Associate Units (Classic, Active, or ARC associate units): Follow the frequency
   interval of the host unit.
   3.3.5. Follow-up Evaluations.
       3.3.5.1. Logistics activities rated “Marginal” or “Unsatisfactory” will have a follow-up
       evaluation within 180 days of the conclusion of the initial LCAP evaluation and will
       receive a grade of either Unsatisfactory or Satisfactory.
       3.3.5.2. Additionally, the LCAP Team Chief may revisit any activities/areas deemed
       substandard regardless of grade. The reevaluated activities/areas will be graded
       Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory.
       3.3.5.3. The follow-up evaluation shall be tailored to properly re-assess the “Marginal”,
       “Unsatisfactory” or substandard activities/areas.
 12                                           AFI20-111_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2012


       3.3.5.4. Logistics activities/areas receiving a rating of “Unsatisfactory” during follow-up
       evaluations will receive additional follow-up assessments until a rating of “Satisfactory”
       is attained.
3.4. Evaluation Focus Areas. The below areas are used to group unit deficiencies in the LCAP
Unit Report for focusing management attention where needed.
   3.4.1. Compliance with Nuclear Surety Standards (if applicable). Personnel at all levels are
   responsible for ensuring nuclear weapon systems, NWRM, Master Nuclear Certification
   Listing (MNCL), and Nuclear Certified Equipment (NCE) are safe, secure, and reliable.
   Ensure weapon system safety rules, owner/user security, and reliability standards are strictly
   adhered to. Nuclear surety is outlined in AFI 91-101 Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety
   Program and defined as materiel, personnel, and procedures which contribute to the
   security, safety, and reliability of nuclear weapons and to the assurance that there will be no
   nuclear weapon accidents, incidents, unauthorized weapon detonations, or degradation in
   performance at the target.
   3.4.2. Qualified and Proficient Workforce. Ensure a properly trained and qualified
   workforce is maintained to accomplish the mission. Commanders are responsible for
   ensuring unit personnel receive the proper training to accomplish the mission. Factors that
   impede the unit’s ability to adequately achieve or maintain a qualified workforce should be
   identified to higher headquarters.
   3.4.3. Compliance with Technical Orders (TO), Instructions, Manuals, and Directives.
   Personnel at all levels are responsible and accountable for enforcing mandatory standards.
   Ensure all applicable TOs, instructions, manuals, and directives are complete, current, and
   used. This includes ensuring required forms and records are properly completed and
   maintained in accordance with applicable directives for any logistics-related activity. The
   following three sub-categories will be used to assess performance in this focus area and to
   facilitate trend analysis:
       3.4.3.1. Human Factors: Internal/External situational elements that result in incorrect
       decision making processes (i.e. stress, time, distractions, complacency, etc…).
       3.4.3.2. Inadequate Guidance: The governing guidance is incorrect or poorly stated
       leading to improper processes or actions (i.e. TOs, AFIs, Supplements, Operating
       Instructions (OI), Policy Letters, etc…).
       3.4.3.3. Documentation: This category indicates a failure to properly document an
       action, process or task (i.e. removing/replacing component, appointment letters, training
       completion documentation, etc.)
   3.4.4. Compliance and Management of Safety Programs.             Personnel at all levels are
   responsible for minimizing risk to equipment and personnel.
   3.4.5. Facilities and Equipment Condition. Supervisors at all levels are required to ensure
   adequate facilities and equipment required to accomplish the mission are available and
   properly maintained. Commanders are responsible for identifying facility and equipment
   conditions and shortfalls that impact mission accomplishment to the appropriate
   agency/higher headquarters.
AFI20-111_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2012                                                            13


   3.4.6. Asset Accountability. Personnel at all levels are responsible for ensuring the proper
   accountability of tools, materiel, equipment, and weapons. This includes ensuring Positive
   Inventory Control (PIC) of nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon systems, NWRM, MNCL,
   Nuclear Certified Equipment (NCE), classified assets, CCI/COMSEC, equipment, serialized
   control items, small arms, conventional munitions, and sensitive related materiel. It includes
   ensuring that accurate logistics data is reflected for the materiel in appropriate functional
   information management systems.
3.5. LCAP Methodology. The LCAP assessments will be conducted through the use of
evaluations, inspections, and observations.
   3.5.1. Evaluations. An evaluation represents the direct evaluation of a logistics action,
   inspection, or training conducted/performed by an individual or team. Evaluations are used
   to evaluate job proficiency, degree of training, and compliance with technical data or
   instructions. Any individual performing, supervising, or evaluating logistics tasks are subject
   to a direct evaluation. LCAP Team personnel performing evaluations must have sufficient
   subject matter expertise to properly and safely conduct the evaluation. Refer to Attachment 4
   for specific procedures on conducting and rating evaluations. Evaluations include:
      3.5.1.1. Personnel Evaluations (PE). A PE is the direct evaluation of an individual or
      team conducting/performing a logistics action. PEs may be conducted on task-oriented
      functions such as equipment maintenance as well as process-oriented functions such as
      vehicle dispatch.
      3.5.1.2. Evaluator Proficiency Evaluations (EPE). An EPE is the direct evaluation of a
      Quality Assurance (QA) individual or any individual performing a quality/compliance
      assurance function in a unit.
      3.5.1.3. Trainer Proficiency Evaluations (TPE). A TPE is the direct evaluation of a unit
      instructor/trainer to determine their ability to teach accurately and sufficiently. TPEs also
      assess weapon system, equipment or process knowledge; teaching methods and
      techniques; the ability to operate trainers; and adequacy and effectiveness of training
      programs. Any individual training personnel on a task or process is subject to a TPE.
      3.5.1.4. Trainer Maintenance Proficiency Evaluations (TMPE). A TMPE is the direct
      evaluation of unit personnel who maintain nuclear weapon training systems/facilities to
      assess their ability to sustain the systems.
   3.5.2. Inspections. An inspection represents inspections of equipment, programs and
   processes, often through the use of LCAP functional checklists, to ensure compliance with
   established standards. Inspections are rated as “Pass” or “Fail”. Inspections include:
      3.5.2.1. Quality Verification Inspection (QVI). A QVI is an inspection of equipment
      condition or a process after an inspection, repair action, and/or task has been completed
      by a technician or supervisor to assess if it was properly completed. The QVI finding
      will reflect deficiencies by the individual who accomplished the task and identify specific
      discrepancies.
      3.5.2.2. Special Inspections (SI). SIs are inspections not covered by QVIs or Evaluations
      and may include, but are not limited to, inspections of: aircraft and equipment forms;
      document control procedures and file plans; consolidated tool kits; inventory controls;
14                                           AFI20-111_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2012


     TO files; vehicle inspections; housekeeping; safety practices; and Foreign Object
     Damage (FOD) program, etc. SIs may be condition, procedural or compliance oriented.
  3.5.3. Observations. Represents observed events or conditions with safety implications or
  technical violations not related to an evaluation or inspection that are considered unsafe, not
  in accordance with established procedures, or in the case of equipment, unfit to operate.
  Observations include:
     3.5.3.1. Detected Safety Violation (DSV). A DSV is an observed unsafe act by an
     individual. The LCAP evaluator must stop the unsafe act immediately. Do not document
     a separate DSV on an individual undergoing a direct evaluation since the unsafe act
     automatically results in an evaluation rating of “Failed”. Annotate the failure with
     “Safety” when a safety violation is committed during an evaluation.
     3.5.3.2. Technical Data Violation (TDV). A TDV is an observation of any person
     performing maintenance or another logistics process without the proper technical data
     available but not in use or not following the correct sequence of steps (if directed). The
     technician must have knowledge of all general directives associated with the job prior to
     performing the task. However, these directives do not need to be present at the job site.
     Do not document a separate TDV on an individual undergoing a direct evaluation since
     failure to use technical data automatically results in an evaluation rating of “Fail”.
     Annotate the failure with “Tech Data” when a TDV is committed during an evaluation.
     3.5.3.3. Unsatisfactory Condition Report (UCR). A UCR is an unsafe or unsatisfactory
     condition, other than a DSV, chargeable to the work center supervisor. UCRs will be
     documented even when it is not possible to determine who created the condition (e.g., a
     classified item is found unsecured upon entry into a work center).
  3.5.4. Logistics Interest Items (LII). LIIs are other interest items that are identified by
  Headquarters Air Force and Lead/C-MAJCOMS.
  3.5.4.1. LIIs provide a means to focus management attention and/or gather data to evaluate
  the status of specific programs and conditions in the field requiring AF senior leader
  attention. LIIs are used by HAF and Lead/C-MAJCOMS functional staffs to make policy
  adjustments and enhance decision-making. The LII originator will determine the scope and
  validity period for each LII.
     3.5.4.2. Responsibilities.
         3.5.4.2.1. HAF/A4L. Manage the AF LII program by coordinating AF LII topic
         proposals, obtaining HAF/A4/7 approval, distribute approved AF LII to
         MAJCOM/A4s, compile and forward LII data to the sponsoring agency.
         3.5.4.2.2. LII Sponsors. Only HAF/MAJCOM functionals may sponsor LIIs.
         Proposed LII topics may be initiated at any level but must be submitted by the
         appropriate      HAF/MAJCOM           functional      to     HAF/A4L         at
         af/a4l.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. Submit LII topic proposals in the format
         provided on the HAF/A4L LCAP Community of Practice (CoP).
         3.5.4.2.3. MAJCOM/A4s.
             3.5.4.2.3.1. LII Inspections. Inspect all applicable active LIIs during formal
             inspections. Units need only be inspected and reported once during the LII’s
AFI20-111_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2012                                                             15


              active period. Document the results of LII inspections as a separate section of the
              final inspection report.
              3.5.4.2.3.2. LII Reports. Consolidate LII inspection results and report to
              HAF/A4LM at A4LMM.maintenance@pentagon.af.mil. Provide a summary of
              units inspected, locations, dates of inspection, and electronic extract of the LII
              portion of the final inspection report. A4 remarks are important to the LII process
              and should be annotated IAW specific instructions attached to each LII.
           3.5.4.2.4. Wing/Unit. Obtain LII information via MAJCOM/A4 or HAF/A4L LCAP
           CoP.
       3.5.4.3. Rating. If rating is required as part of the LII, the scale will be specified in the
       LII instructions.
       3.5.4.4. MAJCOM LIIs. Ensure that MAJCOM LIIs do not conflict with AF LIIs.
3.6. LCAP Checklists
   3.6.1. LCAP functional checklists are developed and published by AF/A4L in coordination
   with Lead MAJCOMs and posted on the AF Portal in the LCAP Community of Practice
   (CoP).
   3.6.1. (AFRC) HQ AFRC LCAP Checklists will not be published in the public domain.
   Units shall utilize checklists in the Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT) to conduct
   self inspections IAW AFI 90-201.
   3.6.2. Checklists serve as a guide for MAJCOM LCAP teams to evaluate units and are not
   all-inclusive nor do they limit the flexibility of LCAP evaluators to address other logistics
   processes in a unit.
   3.6.3. Events. An event is defined as an evaluation or inspection and will receive a “Pass” or
   “Fail” rating. Failed events will be determined by the number of allowable major/minor
   errors as outlined in Tables A.4.1 and A.4.2, HAF/MAJCOM, or the local Quality Assurance
   Program.
   3.6.4. Errors. Reference Tables A.3.2 for definition of a major/minor error.
3.7. Findings Findings are validated deficiencies and will be tracked at the appropriate level
until resolved. Findings may be a standalone deficiency or a roll up of several similar
deficiencies. Findings do not count against a unit’s score unless it is a repeat Major Finding as
defined in Paragraph 3.10.2. Findings include
3.7.1. Major Finding Any deficiency that results or could result in widespread or significant
mission impact or failure. May include any repeat minor finding deemed appropriate by the
LCAP Team Chief. Additionally, a systemic finding across the logistics enterprise may be
documented as a major finding at the LCAP Team Chief’s discretion. Major findings are tracked
and closed out at the MAJCOM level.

   3.7.1. (AFRC) Major Findings are serious indications of systemic problems and can have
   significant bearing on a unit's overall grade. Multiple Majors with direct impact on Safety or
   mission performance will be carefully considered as grounds for Team Chief Assessment.
   The Team Chief will apply the appropriate discretion when assigning these grades.
 16                                           AFI20-111_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2012


3.7.2. Minor Finding. Any deficiency that is procedurally incorrect but only has minor mission
impact. Minor findings are tracked and closed out at the installation level.

3.8. Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL). AQLs will be used to minimize subjectivity in the
LCAP evaluation. An AQL denotes the maximum allowable number of “minor” errors that a
task, process or product may receive and still be rated “Pass” see Table A3.1.
   3.8.1. Exceeding the AQL standard will result in a task/process rating of “Fail”.
   3.8.2. Checklist AQLs will be annotated on the individual checklist as defined by HAF,
   MAJCOM or local Quality Assurance Programs or any combination of the three.
3.9. LCAP Grading. Consistent with LCAP’s purpose to evaluate a unit’s ability to perform
key processes in a safe and compliant manner, units will receive an overall grade based on a five-
tier grading scale.
   3.9.1. Grades will be reported for the lowest reasonable level of an organization based on the
   scope of the evaluation. It shall also be accomplished across the evaluated unit’s chain of
   command up to the Wing-level or equivalent. Associate units will receive one grade and one
   unit report. The unit grade will be part of the LCAP Unit Report using the format in
   Attachment 3.
   3.9.2. The LCAP Team Chief will assign ratings that accurately reflect observed
   performance. The Team Chief will use the described scoring methodology as the starting
   point for determining unit grades. However, the grading criteria are designed as a guide and
   are not a substitute for the judgment of the Team Chief. When the Team Chief ratings differ
   from the established grading criteria, the rationale will be explained in the LCAP Unit
   Report.
   3.9.3. The Five-Tier Grading Scale is:

Table 3.1. Grading Scale

3.10. LCAP Scoring. The overall score will be determined by calculating a baseline score and
then deducting for penalties.
   3.10.1. Baseline Score. The baseline score is calculated by dividing the total number of
   passed events by the total of all events. Events are defined as Evaluations (paragraph 3.5.1)
   and Inspections (paragraph 3.5.2). Do not include observations in the baseline score.
   3.10.2. Deductions. Deductions are calculated by assessing a .5% penalty for each
   observation as defined in paragraph 3.5.3 and repeat “Major” LCAP findings. Refer to
   Attachment 5 for a score calculation example.

  3.10.3. For nuclear units, each condition resulting in, or meeting the criteria for, an
  “Unreliable Nuclear Weapon”, “Unsafe Environment”, or “Insecure Environment” as defined
  in Chairmen Joint Chief of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3263.05 Nuclear Weapons Technical
  Inspections will be treated as a .5% deduction as defined in paragraph 3.10.2. Each of these
  conditions will be reported as a Major Finding as defined in paragraph 3.7 and annotated
  with “UNACCEPTABLE CONDITION THAT REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.”

                                           Attachment 4
                                EVALUATION PROCEDURES

A4.1. General Evaluation Guidance. The procedures in this attachment apply to all evaluations
including nuclear tasks. Evaluation requirements specific to nuclear LCAP evaluations are
clearly identified.
   A4.1.1. Evaluators can conduct evaluations on any personnel who perform, supervise,
   inspect, evaluate, instruct, or train a logistics task. This includes nuclear weapons, nuclear
   weapon systems, warheads, nuclear support equipment and/or their components.
   A4.1.2. The term “technician/team” used in this attachment includes personnel who are
   supervisors, evaluators, trainers, and inspectors. It also includes personnel who instruct a
   technical task involving on-equipment task performances governed by a technical data
   training reference.
   A4.1.3. Evaluations will encompass the total scope of the task to include: tool usage, general
   maintenance/supply chain management practices, technical data usage, conduct of logistics
   processes, adherence to instructions/manuals/directives, and nuclear surety practices, etc.
   A4.1.4. Evaluators may conduct an evaluation while using training items or in training
   facilities.
   A4.1.5. Nuclear weapons maintenance, loading and handling evaluations may be performed
   on trainers or in training facilities. When using trainers, the unit must treat the trainer as if it
   is War Reserve (WR). See CJCSI 3263.05 Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspections for
   additional guidance concerning this information.
   A4.1.6. To the maximum extent possible, before conducting an evaluation, evaluators must
   verify the technician/team under evaluation is task certified in their Training Business Area,
   Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP), AF Form 2435, Load Training and
   Certification Document or MIS (i.e. PACSS in AFMC). This verification must be completed
   before the final grade is validated.
   A4.1.7. When selecting tasks for evaluation, evaluators must ensure they evaluate a variety
   of tasks involving different equipment and/or different actions for each technician/team. In
   addition, they must ensure evaluations cover various systems for which a unit is qualified.
   A4.1.8. To the maximum extent possible, evaluators will have their own copy of technical
   data/instructions available for the task being evaluated. If unavailable, the evaluator will
   confirm the currency of the technical data/instructions used to accomplish the task.
   A4.1.9. Evaluations may be accomplished during actual task performance or while
   inspecting equipment or documentation. However, evaluators may assign tasks to evaluate
   personnel proficiency. Evaluators will not participate in the task being performed.
   A4.1.10. Evaluators must afford every reasonable opportunity for technicians/teams to detect
   a defect or deficiency.
   A4.1.11. Evaluations on nuclear weapons maintenance and handling certifiable tasks
   identified in AFI 21-204, Nuclear Weapons Maintenance Procedures must be performed by
   7-level or above, Job Qualification Standard (JQS) qualified evaluators.
AFI20-111_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2012                                                           31


A4.2. Evaluation Briefing. Before starting an evaluation, the evaluator will conduct a briefing
with the technician/team. During the briefing, the evaluator must advise the technician/team of
the following:
   A4.2.1. The evaluation starts when the technician/team begins the task, or portion of the task
   to be evaluated, and is completed when the entire task or previously determined portion of
   the task is finished. For tasks already in progress, the evaluator will notify the
   technician/team they are under evaluation and brief them as soon as practical.
   A4.2.2. All logistics actions performed are subject to evaluation.
   A4.2.3. Safety and security should not be compromised for any reason.
   A4.2.4. All detected errors during the evaluation will be used to calculate an overall award
   of “Pass” or “Fail”.
   A4.2.5. The technician/team can request permission from the evaluator to take short breaks
   not to exceed 15 minutes during the evaluation. The evaluator will use professional
   discretion to approve or disapprove the request.
   A4.2.6. The technician/team must notify the evaluator of applicable information that could
   affect the task evaluation.        This includes any Previously Complied With (PCW)
   task(s)/step(s). If the technician/team fails to do this, they may be charged with an error for
   requirements that were omitted during the task performance that were not identified as PCW
   prior to the evaluation critique.
   A4.2.7. The evaluator may ask questions or inject a task to determine technician/team
   knowledge of the task under evaluation. The technician/team may use technical references to
   answer any questions.
   A4.2.8. The technician/team is responsible for completion of all tasks and related actions.
   The evaluator's presence does not shift this responsibility.
   A4.2.9. The technician/team may ask for technical help from personnel/agencies normally
   available during day-to-day operations. The LCAP evaluator will use professional discretion
   to determine if the request and time delay are reasonable.
   A4.2.10. For nuclear LCAP evaluations, the evaluator will not be considered the second
   person to satisfy the Two-Person Concept.
A4.3. Evaluator Task Performance Actions. During every task evaluation, the evaluator must
detect and correct, to the maximum extent possible, all errors. The evaluator must select the best
option available to correct the situation. It may be advantageous to correct minor errors during
the critique phase; other errors may warrant immediate correction. The evaluator should
consider giving the technician/team the opportunity to make decisions on courses of action on
their own using the resources available to them.
   A4.3.1. All detected errors during the evaluation will be used to calculate an overall grade
   using the criteria listed in Table A3.1.
   A4.3.2. Detected errors during the evaluation will be classified as “Major” or “Minor” using
   the evaluation criteria listed in Table A3.2, applicable HAF/MAJCOM or local Quality
   Assurance program standards.
 32                                           AFI20-111_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2012


   A4.3.3. Technicians/Teams that commit any error classified as a “Major” in Table A3.2
   anytime during the evaluation process will be rated “Fail”.
   A4.3.4. If the evaluator determines during the evaluation that a technician/team cannot
   correctly or safely accomplish the task without excessive outside intervention or assistance,
   the evaluator must apply the following guidelines:
       A4.3.4.1. Terminate the task immediately.
       A4.3.4.2. Notify the      technician's/team’s    work    center    supervisor   or   Flight
       CC/Superintendent.
A4.4. Evaluator Post-Task Performance Actions. The evaluator must perform the following
actions as soon as practical after the evaluation:
   A4.4.1. Award an overall rating of “Pass” or “Fail” for the evaluated task using guidance in
   Table A3.1.
   A4.4.2. Critique the technician/team on the entire task.        The critique must cover the
   following:
       A4.4.2.1. A detailed explanation of each detected error including who received it,
       category, mission impact and correct procedures.
       A4.4.2.2. A review of the technician’s/team’s strengths and weaknesses.
       A4.4.2.3. Recommended methods of task accomplishment.
       A4.4.2.4. An exchange of ideas and techniques.
       A4.4.2.5. For failed evaluations, notify the technician's/team’s work center supervisor or
       Flight CC/Superintendent and identify the substandard performance that contributed to
       the rating.
   A4.4.3. Report detected observations outside the scope of the evaluation as a Detected
   Safety Violation (DSV), Technical Data Violation (TDV), or Unsatisfactory Condition
   Report (UCR), based on applicability. For these detected observations, the evaluator will:
       A4.4.3.1. Correct the observation immediately, if possible.
       A4.4.3.2. Document all facts surrounding the observation for report purposes.
       A4.4.3.3. Notify LCAP Team leadership of the observation for verification purposes.
       A4.4.3.4. Ensure the verified observation is included in the draft report.
A4.5. Additional Trainer Proficiency Evaluation (TPE) Guidelines. In addition to the general
guidelines described in paragraphs A3.1 thru A3.4, when conducting TPEs, LCAP evaluators
will:
   A4.5.1. Coordinate with unit instructors/trainers on which tasks are acceptable for TPEs.
   A4.5.2. Brief the following items to the instructor/trainer under evaluation:
       A4.5.2.1. The instructor/trainer must prevent/immediately correct the following: Weapon
       System Safety Rules (WSSR) violations, weapon system code compromises, Two-Person
       Concept violations, significant security violations or safety errors which could result in
       serious injury to personnel, failure to use required technical data during the logistics
AFI20-111_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2012                                                             33


       process and any error which could result in potential/imminent equipment damage or
       personnel injury.
       A4.5.2.2. The instructor/trainer must correct other errors before completing the training
       session.   This correction may include anything from verbal feedback to re-
       accomplishment of the erroneous procedures. The training session is considered
       complete when the instructor/trainer critiques the student’s performance.
       A4.5.2.3. Evaluators will not generate an evaluation report on the trainees. The
       evaluation will focus solely on the instructor’s/trainer’s proficiency and the efficiency of
       training delivered. Errors committed by the trainees will have no impact on the
       evaluation unless the instructor/trainer does not detect and correct the errors.
       A4.5.2.4. Evaluators will consider the instructor’s/trainer’s familiarity with procedures,
       use of and adherence to technical data and lesson plans, verbal skills, ability to clearly
       and precisely describe procedures, and the degree of control over the trainees.
       A4.5.2.5. A TPE will be rated “Fail” if the instructor/trainer does not detect, correct, and
       provide/defer re-training for any error classified as “Major”. Additionally, the evaluation
       will also be rated as “Fail” if an incomplete training process takes place such as failing to
       instruct critical portions of the task.

Program standards
When applying the Rating Criteria, consider the following:
1. Number of tasks evaluated. (Not general tasks such as use of technical data, common hand
tools, etc.)
2. Complexity and frequency of tasks evaluated.
3. Reasonable impact of each error committed.
4. Complexity of the program being inspected.

Table A4.2. Evaluation Error Criteria Description
GENERAL EVALUATION CRITERIA
NOTE: The Major and Minor errors listed in this table are not all-inclusive. The LCAP
evaluator has the authority to identify Major or Minor errors that are not listed in this table.
MAJOR ERRORS:
1. Significant Safety Error. An error that, as a reasonable expectation, would result in injury to
personnel caused by an individual’s disregard or lack of attention to safety precautions.
2. Significant Equipment Damage. An error that, as a reasonable expectation, would damage a
support equipment/weapon system component to the extent it cannot be used for its intended
purpose. This does not include damage to common hand tools.
3. Significant Security Violations. An error that, as a reasonable expectation, would result in
compromise of the weapon system, subsystem, or support equipment (Actual or Possible).
4. Failure to have available and comply with required technical data while performing an action.
5. Individual not trained/certified on task being performed.
6. Failure to accomplish a critical portion of a task that results in incomplete task performance
by not verifying the operability/serviceability of support equipment, subsystem, or weapon
system component.
7. Failure to document actions/conditions that, as a reasonable expectation, would result in
erroneous equipment availability status or weapon system status; or create a significant
safety/security deficiency.
8. Failure to recognize an unacceptable condition/test result that is cause for rejection of
equipment or prevents support equipment/system or weapon system component from operating.
9. Failure to recognize an acceptable condition/test that caused rejection of serviceable
components or equipment.
10. Clearly demonstrated inability to successfully complete the task due to a lack of job
knowledge. Cannot correctly or safely accomplish task without excessive outside intervention.
11. Failure to follow custody transfer procedures.

12. A condition that creates an unreliable missile, missile component, equipment item or an
unsafe or insecure environment.

13. Significant system input errors. Errors that, as a reasonable expectation based on quantity or
sensitivity of the input(s) would result in significant loss of data accuracy.

Nuclear Evaluation Criteria:
1. Violation of Weapon System Safety Rules. An error that would violate weapon system safety
rules pertaining to maintenance on weapon systems (Actual or Possible). (Refs. AFI 91-114,
AFI20-111_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2012                                                          35


Safety Rules for the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Systems and AFI 91-111, Safety Rules for
US Strategic Bomber Aircraft).
2. Code Handling Violation. An error that, as a reasonable expectation, would result in a code
compromise (Actual or Possible).
3. Violation of Two-Person Concept. An error that, as a reasonable expectation, would result in
a compromise of a no-lone zone or critical component(s) (Actual or Possible).
4. A condition which creates an unreliable nuclear weapon, and unsafe environment, or an
insecure environment as defined in CJCSI 3263.05 Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspections.

5. Failure to ensure proper storage, shipment and positive inventory control of nuclear weapons,
nuclear weapon systems, Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM), classified assets,
Controlled Cryptographic Item (CCI)/ Communication Security (COMSEC), equipment,
serialized control items, weapons, and sensitive assets.
MINOR ERRORS:
1. An error that does not prevent a support equipment/weapon system component from being
used for its intended purpose, but would, as a reasonable expectation, have a detrimental effect
on the operational life of the component/equipment/system. This may include damage to
common hand tools due to misuse.
2. An error that, as a reasonable expectation, could require support equipment to be returned to
another agency for recalibration/recertification.
3. An error that lacks the seriousness to meet the criteria for a major error.
4. Failure to read a warning or caution is a minor error, provided the warning/caution is not
violated.

                        LCAP SCORE CALCULATION EXAMPLE

A5.1. During a particular LCAP evaluation, a unit is subjected to 150 Evaluations and
Inspections. Of those 150 events, 135 are rated as passed. Additionally, during the evaluation,
the LCAP Team observed 2 DSVs, 1 TDV and identified 1 repeat “Major” finding.
A5.2. To obtain the overall grade:
   A5.2.1. Calculate the unit’s baseline score. Baseline Score: 135 passed events divided by
   150 total events = 90%.
   A5.2.2. Calculate the deductions. Deductions: 4 penalties (2 DSVs + 1 TDV + 1 repeat)
   multiplied by .5% = 2%.
   A5.2.3. The unit overall grade is calculated by subtracting the deductions from the baseline
   score. Unit Overall Score: 90% baseline - 2% deductions = 88%.
   A5.2.4. Using the five-tier grading scale from paragraph 3.9.3, the unit is rated
   “Satisfactory.”
