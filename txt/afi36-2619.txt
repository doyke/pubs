                                           Chapter 1

                                          OVERVIEW

1.1. Overview: This instruction provides guidance to the MPA manday program as it applies
under Title 10 U.S.C. §12301(d) and (h) and all Title 10 mobilization authorities for Active Duty
for Operational Support for the Regular (Active) Component (ADOS-AC). The Active Duty
Military Personnel Account (3500 Appropriation) funds the MPA manday program. The MPA
manday program provides operational access across all Air Reserve Component (ARC) mission
sets. The overarching purpose for MPA manday program is to provide the Air Force with skilled
manpower to support Air Force missions when regular component resources are not available or
sufficient. Commands, Staffs, and Agencies will utilize the MPA manday program to access
capabilities within the ARC to support operational missions. For mobilization under Title 10,
also refer to processes outlined in AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution,
and AFI 10-402, Mobilization Planning.
   1.1.1. There are several types of MPA manday authorities. Guidance in this AFI applies to
   all types unless specifically identified. An MPA manday tour will specify a continuous
   period of activation under the authorities specified in paragraph 1.1.
   1.1.2. Before volunteering for activation under an MPA manday tour, ARC airmen must
   have concurrence of their state and wing leadership if an ANG asset, Supporting Commander
   if a Unit Reservist, or the owning active duty commander/director and Program Manager if
   an Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA). All ARC members, regardless of activation
   authority, are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) while performing
   MPA manday tours. Before performing on an MPA manday tour, supporting units will
   verify the member meets AF readiness requirements as well as uniform, dress and
   appearance standards. ARC members should not perform MPA manday tours for the same
   chain of command that evaluates them as a civilian or contractor employee. (T-1).
   1.1.3. The institutionalized, requirements-based management plan utilizes the Program
   Objective Memorandum (POM) process, where the Commands, Staffs, and Agencies work
   closely with the combatant commanders and Strategic Plans and Programs (A8) staffs to
   identify annual MPA manday requirements. Once submitted, these requirements are staffed,
   verified, and vetted through the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS) based on established
   priorities published in the AF Annual Planning and Programming Guidance (APPG).
   Additional criteria such as mission impact, critical skills, active duty manning, and level of
   support are also weighted to finalize the prioritization. Refer to Chapter 2 for further details.

  MPA manday tours. If disciplinary action is necessary the Active duty supervisors and
  commanders should consult with a judge advocate. For Air National Guard members
  coordinate actions with the 201st Mission Support Squadron (MSS); the 201 MSS retains
  ADCON over ANG members on MPA tours. For IMA members, coordinate actions with the
  detachment Program Manager. For information on tour curtailment for cause see paragraph
  3.2. Tour Curtailment Notifications. (T-1)
  1.3.2. Travel and Per Diem is not included in the MPA manday fund citation. Supported
  units are responsible for providing the fund citation such as their O&M or Transportation
  Working Capital Funds (TWCF) to cover travel and per diem costs unless the command FMs
  have entered one or more memorandums of agreements (MOAs) with the ARC. (T-1).
  1.3.3. Commands, staffs and agencies should make every reasonable effort to find volunteers
  that are command-gained as this maximizes the operational readiness of the ARC asset. (T-1)

  same period of performance. Military Technicians / Civil Service employees must be in
  military status when performing an MPA manday tour.
  1.3.5. Annual leave programs give members the opportunity to take leave within the
  constraints of operational requirements. All MPA manday tours include accrued leave and
  authorized travel time. Members on MPA manday tours for 30 days or longer earn military
  leave days (2.5 days per month). Barring unforeseen circumstances, members must be
  afforded the opportunity to take unused leave, prior to the end of their tour. Additional tours
  or extensions may not be created for the sole purpose of taking leave. (T-1).
     1.3.5.1. ARC members unable to take leave prior to the end of an MPA tour may choose
     to be paid for unused leave or may carry the unused leave balance into the next
AFI36-2619 18 JULY 2014                                                                       11


     concurrent period of MPA active service. Members wishing to take leave carried over
     from a previous tour must coordinate and gain approval from gaining unit commander
     prior to starting the tour so all projected leave can be accounted in the tour length. Leave
     will be taken within the parameters of the order in which it was requested, as orders will
     not be extended for the sole purpose of taking leave or leave carryover. For additional
     information, refer to Chapter 3. (T-1).
     1.3.5.2. Supplemental MPA manday tours may include Service/CCDR-directed training
     and/or Joint Expeditionary Team training, as required for deployment and identified by

  while on an MPA tour only at the approval of the RegAF supervisor and if attendance is
  required to maintain mission certification as applicable to their AFSC. Members may not
  collect compensation for UTA/IDT while on an MPA tour. ARC commanders should stay
  cognizant if a member’s MPA manday tour may drive a change in a resources reporting
  requirement. (T-1).
  1.3.8. Once an RC member begins an MPA tour, they are obligated to fulfill the entire tour
  length unless: a) they are found to be unable or unfit to perform the RegAF mission for
  which they were selected; b) the ARC commander (supporting commander) requests early
  termination based on ARC mission requirements; or, c) the RegAF commander (supported
  commander) approves early release based on ARC member’s request. For RegAF missions
  completed earlier than expected, refer to Chapter 3 for tour curtailment policy. (T-1).
  1.3.9. MPA mandays are not transferred from one fiscal year to the next; however, tours may
  be approved to cross fiscal years provided the Continuing Resolution Authority (CRA)
  statement is included in the allocation. Adjustments to tours based on CRA approval may be
  required as part of effective MPA manday program management. (T-0).
  1.3.10. The MMOs at the Commands, Staffs, and Agencies will coordinate on any MOAs or
  Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) that involves MPA manday usage. (T-1).
  1.3.11. Off duty employment that is concurrent with an MPA manday tour requires
  coordination and approval from the active duty supervisor. ARC members must accomplish
  an AF Form 3902, Application and Approval for Off-Duty Employment, and receive approval
  prior to proceeding. (T-1).
  1.3.12. When allocating MPA mandays, consider command manning levels in required
  AFSCs. Command A1’s can obtain manning statistics from the AFPC Secure Site (Retrieval
  Application Website (RAW)).

                     DETERMINING MPA MANDAY REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Planning and Programming for Steady State Mandays
   2.1.1. Process:
      2.1.1.1. The AF developed and implemented a requirements-based process to identify
      and validate all manday requirements. This process is embedded into the AF planning
      and programming process. MPA manday requirements are vetted through AF senior
      leadership for approval and linked to resource allocation decisions. This process ensures
      validated and approved requirements are appropriately funded to include validation and
      tracking of reimbursable requirements, as funds must be collected. MPA mandays
      (steady state, reimbursements from other DoD and non-DoD agencies, and supplemental
      funded) are critical to resourcing Total Force Initiatives and extended military operations.
      Reference Figure 2.1
      2.1.1.2. Commands, staffs, and agencies submit requirements to the AFCS based on
      established priorities published in the AF Annual Planning and Programming Guidance
      (APPG).
      2.1.1.3. Once submissions from the commands are received, AF/A1M consolidates,
      verifies, and validates against AF priorities. Additional criteria such as mission impact,
      critical skills, RegAF manning, and level of support are also weighted to provide a force-
      wide prioritization. The Steady State ADOS Panel stratifies requirements based on
      mission shortfalls, critical skills, APPG priorities, command priorities, and AF core
      functions. Recommendations are prepared and presented to the AF planning and
      programming process for funding.

      2.2.1.1. Annually, the AF uses the criteria outlined by the latest Office of Management
      and Budget (OMB) guidance to verify and validate the war effort supplemental funded
      requirements (Fig 2). Supplemental (Contingency) requirements cover both voluntary
      and involuntary war effort support. A data call is sent out to the commands, staffs, and
      agencies in March timeframe for the upcoming fiscal year.
      2.2.1.2. Commands, staffs, and agencies submit supplemental requirements to the AFCS
      based on OMB guidance. (T-1).
      2.2.1.3. Once submissions from the commands are received, AF/A1M, with assistance
      from AF/A5X and AF/A3O consolidates, verifies, and validates submissions against
      OMB guidance. Additional criteria such as deployed requirements, direct support and
      backfill for RegAF members are used to stratify submissions. AF/A1M prepares
      recommendations to present to the AF Personnel and Budget Review Committee (PBRC)
      for funding.
      2.2.1.4. Steady state and supplemental MPA manday resources are distributed in
      accordance with AF level decisions. Future fiscal year manday resources are allocated to
      the commands in June providing the commands 90 days to develop preliminary execution
      plans. Individuals selected to fill CCDR requirements via AEF may be issued an MPA
      manday allocation prior to manday resource allocation, to ensure the maximum
      TRICARE benefit can be utilized by the individual. Updated allocations would be
      distributed if the funding provided by Congress varied from the President’s Budget (PB)
      request.

   2.4.1. Starting in FY14, APPG Priorities will include: “B4 – Emergent requirements to
   support the Total Force Enterprise (TFE) AC/ARC Mix Guidance, not identified in other B
   categories”. During execution year this account will be held and allocated at the AF level.
   The process for requesting and distributing the B4 MPA account is detailed at Figure 2.3.
   2.4.2. The B4 account includes MPA mandays managed by AF/A1M to provide immediate
   access to ARC capability for unforeseen/unprogrammed requirements during the execution
   year. Examples include:
      2.4.2.1. Emergent non Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) mission support
      required/requested by the AC.
      2.4.2.2. Increased CCDR-directed training requirements not programmed or budgeted.
   2.4.3. Emergent requirements may be submitted to the HAF by the ARC via the FGC or the
   ANG AEF Cell after verification by the AC lead Commands. AF/A1MP will validate and
   allocate mandays from the B4 account.
   2.4.4. Commands must identify related O&M costs (e.g. travel and per diem) associated with
   requirements.
   2.4.5. In case of a dispute between the AC command (force provider) and the ARC, an
   adjudication process is in place. Reference Figure 2.3.
   2.4.6. Figure 2.4. outlines the overall MPA timeline spanning from planning and
   programming, through the budget and execution years.

                                           Chapter 3

                           MPA MANDAY TOUR PROVISIONS

3.1. Activation Periods
   3.1.1. As a matter of Service Policy, MPA manday orders for ARC members supporting the
   AC in a voluntary status (10 USC §12301(d)) should be for durations of 181 days or less.
   3.1.2. The MPA manday request will typically include the following in the activation period:
   Mandays to cover pre-deployment training listed within the Time Phased Force Deployment
   Data (TPFDD) line item remarks, or Service/CCDR-directed training as identified by
   ACC/A3O, travel to/from the AOR as defined by the Joint Federal Travel Regulation or
   USTRANSCOM planning factors; the estimated tour length (ETL)/time-in-theater; out-
   processing (2 days); in-processing (2 days from redeployment, only if not authorized
   downtime which is personnel reconstitution time). If authorized down time, then out-
   processing will be accomplished during the downtime; Command, Staff, and Agency
   downtime (dependent on the length of the tour, and no more than 14 days), and accrued leave
   (2.5 days for every 30 days on active duty).
3.2. Tour Curtailment Notifications
   3.2.1. This applies to all ADOS-AC activations except mobilization. Once a tour begins, for
   changes to the RegAF mission and AF is unable to remission, unless waived by the ARC
   member, individuals on MPA manday tours of 90 days or more will be given at least 60 days
   advanced notice of any change to their original tour length; members on tour for 31 to 89
   days will be given 30 days advanced notice of tour curtailment. (T-1).
   3.2.2. Members may request curtailment of orders; however, approval is based on the needs
   of the RegAF duty commander and supported mission. The notification requirement is not
   applicable if the tour curtailment is at the individual’s request, or if an individual waives the
   advanced notification. (T-1).
   3.2.3. If member takes action or fails to take action resulting in the commander’s
   determination that the member is no longer fit to perform duties (e.g. revoked security
   clearance required for the job hired, fitness standards, etc.,), advanced notification
   requirements in Paragraph 3.2.1. do not apply. (T-1).
   3.2.4. If a member takes action or fails to take action resulting in UCMJ actions, the
   member’s orders may be amended to transfer to a 10 USC § 802 status. Commanders should
   obtain legal advice before taking action. (T-1).
   3.2.5. Medical Continuation (MEDCON) tours are terminated when the member’s medical
   issues are resolved IAW DoDI 1241.2, Reserve Component Incapacitation System
   Management. Therefore, the tour curtailment notification requirements do not apply to
   MEDCON tours.
   3.2.6. All active duty orders contain a start and an end date. ARC members should remain
   cognizant of these dates. If/when the official tour end date is modified (curtailed or
   extended), ARC members will be provided advance notice, as outlined in 3.2.1., of the new
24                                                                AFI36-2619 18 JULY 2014


  tour end date to allow for adequate transition time for the member. Recommend members
  sign a Statement of Understanding, an example is at Attachment 3. (T-1).
     3.2.6.1. Hardship Application Request: This applies to involuntary activations
     (mobilization). An ARC airman may submit a hardship application for evaluation if
     unable to be remissioned to meet another AF requirement and member has incurred a
     “hardship” because of early mobilization curtailment. Hardship should be the result of
     mobilization and early deactivation/demobilization; however, other circumstances that
     may prevent an individual from returning to civilian status may be considered.
     3.2.6.2. Members with approved hardship cases may be retained for a period up to 60
     days but not to exceed the original activation period.
     3.2.6.3. Hardship requests will not be based on a problem(s) that existed prior to
     activation (e.g., individuals who were unemployed when activated, cannot base their
     hardship application on the fact that they “do not have a job to go back to").
     Examples considered for approval (not all inclusive):
        3.2.6.3.1. Individual voided an employment contract to come on AD for 12 months.
        Member was scheduled for deactivation after 60/90 days with no prospect for a new
        employment contract until 6 months after release from AD.
        3.2.6.3.2. Individual sold his/her medical practice believing he/she would be on AD
        for at least 24 months.
        3.2.6.3.3. Individual was between jobs, left one employer, and accepted a job with a
        new employer, not yet established when activated.
        3.2.6.3.4. Individual signed privately owned business over to another individual for
        the 12 months he/she was activated.
     Examples not considered for approval (not all inclusive):
        3.2.6.3.5. Individual was unemployed when activated.
        3.2.6.3.6. Individual makes more money on AD than in his/her civilian job.
        3.2.6.3.7. Individual who requests retention for the purpose of skill level upgrade to
        be qualified for enlistment in the RegAF.
        3.2.6.3.8. Individuals will not be retained to attend schools, backfill, or for the
        purpose of upgrading SORTS levels.
        3.2.6.3.9. Individuals will not be retained on AD for the purpose of gaining eligibility
        for entitlements.
  3.2.7. Process: Member must request retention on AD for Hardship Reasons (personal,
  financial or medical caused by mobilization and early deactivation/demobilization) and
  submit all required documents, an example is at Attachment 4, at least 15 days prior to
  established deactivation/demobilization date. (T-3).
     3.2.7.1. Hardship application requests shall be submitted to the ANGRC or AFR FGC
     for review, determination of other tour opportunities, and recommendation.
     Recommendations from the ARC will include a statement from the ANGRC or FGC
AFI36-2619 18 JULY 2014                                                                      25


      detailing other opportunities, if available; explain whether they were offered to the
      member; and if not, why not. The statement must also include, information on any tours
      offered and declined by the service member. (T-3).
      3.2.7.2. The ANGRC or FGC then forwards service members hardship application with
      recommendation to AF/A1MP who will lead an adjudication panel with AF/A1PX,
      AF/A5XW, AF/REP, AF/A3O and NGB/A1PR. If the package is recommended for
      approval, notification and instructions for placing the member on 10 USC §12301
      “voluntary” duty status will be sent directly to the FGC or the ANGRC.
      3.2.7.3. If the adjudication panel does not recommend approval of the hardship
      application package, the package will be forwarded to SAF/MR for further review and
      consideration.
3.3. Leave Entitlements
   3.3.1. Annual leave programs give members the opportunity to take leave within the
   constraints of operational requirements. For ARC airmen on tour for 30 or more days, IAW
   AFI 36-2254 Vol 1, Reserve Personnel Participation, accrued leave must be included in tour
   orders. MPA manday tours for 30 days or longer earn military leave days (2.5 days per
   month). Members are encouraged to use leave for the maximum benefit of the member, prior
   to the end of their tour if military requirements permit. Additional tours or extensions may
   not be created for the purpose of taking leave.
   3.3.2. MPA Manday activations/mobilizations. Leave is calculated based on the mission
   start and end date. It is not earned during authorized downtime or while using accrued leave
   (from a prior active duty period).
   3.3.3. While serving on a manday tour, ARC members request leave using the AF Form 988,
   Leave Request/Authorization, from their AD supervisor. AD supervisors approve leave
   requests and validate upon the member’s return. Members will provide their RegAF
   supervisors with the appropriate supporting unit and/or the ARC member’s associated leave
   processing office. Supervisors will forward approved leave requests to the ARC member’s
   supporting leave processing office. As a condition of employment, ARC airmen will submit
   a "Leave Plan" showing when leave will be taken during the number of days the members
   have been requested to perform. As leave management for ARC members is a manual
   process, AD supervisors and members have a shared responsibility to ensure proper
   accounting for leave usage. (T-1).
   3.3.4. ARC members may carry unused leave into the next period of active service. ARC
   members must gain approval from their AD supervisor of their intent to utilize accrued leave
   prior to establishing their reporting date and tour length. Leave balances are subject to the
   fiscal year limitations. (T-1).
   3.3.5. At the end of a tour, if accrued leave was not used, the member may be eligible to be
   paid for unused accrued leave. Accrued leave payments will include unused half-day
   increments; however members are not allowed to take a full day of leave when they only
   have a half day earned. Leave is paid on the basis of the basic rate of pay to which the
   member is entitled on date of release. Unused accrued leave for which payment is made is
   not considered as active duty service for any purpose (Ref AFI 36-3003, Military Leave
   Program).

3.4. Travel and Per Diem
   3.4.1. The JFTR, Chapter U7600, addresses travel and transportation allowances for ARC
   members. The maximum allowable time to receive per diem at one location is 180 days.
   Requests for per diem beyond that timeframe must have SAF/MR approval prior to the start
   of the tour or prior to the effective date of any amendment extending the tour. (T-1).
   3.4.2. When authorized, travel and per diem payments associated with MPA manday tours
   are normally funded by the requesting agency or organization. (T-1).
      3.4.2.1. Per diem entitlement cannot be waived by the member or denied by the orders
      issuing authority. (T-1).
      3.4.2.2. The corporate limits and commuting distance of the duty location where the
      MPA active duty will be performed will be determined by the installation commander,
      and may be identified in a base operating instruction or policy letter. (T-1).
      3.4.2.3. ARC member’s travel time is always included when computing MPA tour length
      in accordance with JFTR, paragraph U3025, travel time. (T-1).
      3.4.2.4. Orders may not be accomplished after the fact to provide an entitlement for per
      diem. (T-1).
      3.4.2.5. DD Form 1351-2 Travel Voucher or DTS travel voucher must be signed by the
      ARC member for payment of per diem and travel expenses and submitted to the
      appropriate servicing finance office within 5 working days after tour completion. (T-0).
      3.4.2.6. ARC members performing a long tour (over 180 days) who do not live within
      commuting distance must report to the base housing referral office serving the duty
      location before entering into a rental, lease, or purchase agreement for off-base housing.
      (T-3).
3.5. Post Deployment/Mobilization and Respite Absence (PDMRA)
   3.5.1. Post Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence (PDMRA) is a benefit, not an
   entitlement. MPA tours should include allowance for PDMRA for ARC members who
   mobilize or deploy with a frequency beyond established DoD rotation policy
   thresholds. Deployments/mobilizations to CONUS and non-foreign OCONUS locations
   (Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, Puerto Rico etc.) are not eligible for PDMRA regardless of the type
   of deployment/mobilization orders.
      3.5.1.1. Refer to AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, for eligibility and calculation of
      PDMRA days.
      3.5.1.2. Commanders will ensure airmen are advised to use accrued PDMRA as soon as
      possible after returning from deployment. Accrued PDMRA earned during one MPA
      tour cannot be carried over to a subsequent MPA tour, a new Permanent Duty Station
      (PDS), a new unit of assignment, or into sanctuary status. It is a use or lose benefit
      during the mobilization order period under which it is earned. (T-1).
      3.5.1.3. Member’s unit commander must report to SAF/MR through their chain of
      command to explain why RC airmen are unable to utilize accrued PDMRA days during
      their current mobilization order. (T-1).

                                          Chapter 4

          MPA ALLOCATION FOR MEDICAL CONTINUATION (MEDCON)

4.1. Overview. Per AFI 36-2910, Line of Duty (Misconduct) Determination, the purpose of
MEDCON is to authorize medical and dental care for members who incur or aggravate an injury,
illness or disease in the line of duty and to provide pay and allowances while they are being
evaluated, treated for or recovering from a service-connected injury, illness or disease. ARC
members may be entitled to MEDCON when they are unable to perform military duties due to an
injury, illness or disease incurred or aggravated while serving in a duty status.
   4.1.1. See AFI 36-2910 Chapter 5 for MEDCON eligibility, roles and responsibilities, case
   management process, as well as validation, approval, termination and appeals processes.
4.2. Extension of MPA Orders (Pre-MEDCON). An ARC Airman on orders may be retained
on orders for up to 30 days with approval from the Airman, the Airman’s home station unit
commander, and the orders issuing authority, if the airman has incurred or aggravated an injury,
illness, or disease in the line of duty (refer to AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and
Execution, para. 9.17.1). The purpose of the order extension is to allow more time to assess the
airman’s medical condition and for the Military Treatment Facility (MTF), Reserve Medical Unit
(RMU) or Guard Medical Unit (GMU) to initiate or complete a Line of Duty (LOD)
determination, determine whether the medical condition renders the airman unable to meet
retention or mobility standards, and provide medical documentation to support a request for
MEDCON orders. The order extension is not for the purpose of taking leave or reconstitution
time.
   4.2.1. In accordance with AFI 36-2910, if the airman’s medical condition cannot be resolved
   or diagnosed prior to completion of an Active Duty order, the airman's RegAF commander
   may request an extension of the Active Duty order for up to 30 additional days through the
   Administrative Control (ADCON) unit, or, if deployed, the Personnel Support for
   Contingency Operations (PERSCO), and the chain of command. (T-1).
       4.2.1.1. All Active Duty MPA order extension requests must be entered in the AF
       directed MPA management data system and routed through the appropriate Command
       FAM and then to the Command, Staff or Agency MMO. The ARC unit will accomplish
       a new MPA tour request (under 10§USC 12301(d) authority) ensuring there is no break
       in service using the tour-title code “2x” while keeping the original Manday Expenditure
       Allocation Number (MEAN) code and tour type (Steady State, Supplemental, etc.). MPA
       manday allocation authority for orders extension remains with the Commands, Staffs or
       Agencies MPA Management Office. (T-1).
       4.2.1.2. Any subsequent request for additional MPA days beyond the original 30 day
       extension will be considered as an exception to policy. Documentation and timelines
       must be submitted with the waiver request and have commander’s endorsement. Submit
       exception to policy requests NLT 7 business days prior to current tour expiration. (T-1).
4.3. Requesting MEDCON Orders. Requests for MEDCON orders are submitted to the ARC
CMO for validation, approval, and certification (refer to Figure 4.1 for further guidance).
AFI36-2619 18 JULY 2014                                                                                                    29

4.4. Allocation and Issuance of MEDCON Orders. MEDCON may be funded by ADOS-AC
(MPA) or ADOS-RC (RPA). The following guidance is for ADOS-AC. MEDCON under
ADOS-AC is for members who were injury was incurred or aggravated on an ADOS-AC tour.
When the MEDCON request has been validated, approved, and certified, the ARC CMD will
generate a certification form to support allocation of MEDCON days per AFI 36-2910, the
MEDCON number of days will be allocated as follows:
   4.4.1. Title 10 MPA MEDCON Days. When a request for MEDCON orders has been
   validated, approved, and certified by the ARC CMO, a certification form will be generated to
   support allocation of MEDCON days and will be forwarded to the ARC CMO Resource
   Advisor who will request, using AF directed MPA manday data system, the number of MPA
   mandays indicated on the certification form which in turn will allow the MEDCON request
   to flow to the AF/A1MP MEDCON Program Manager for allocation.
      4.4.1.1. The ARC CMO Resource Advisor will:
          4.4.1.1.1. Ensure due diligence in requesting MPA mandays; and
          4.4.1.1.2. Be the POC for any required audit actions pertaining to MEDCON MPA
          funding certification.
      4.4.1.2. The MEDCON Program Manager (AF/A1MP) shall:
          4.4.1.2.1. Allocate the requested MPA resources using AF directed MPA manday
          data system;
          4.4.1.2.2. Account for MPA mandays as part of the MPA account.
      4.4.1.3. The Airman’s supporting unit will issue the MEDCON order and make
      appropriate updates/inputs into the AF-directed MPA manday data system.
   4.4.2. Before MEDCON orders are issued, an ARC CMO MEDCON Airman
   Responsibilities letter will be signed by the member and filed with the ARC CMO.
4.5. Termination of MEDCON Orders.
   4.5.1. When MEDCON orders are terminated in accordance with AFI 36-2910 the AF
   directed MPA manday data system will be updated to return unused days MPA mandays to
   AF/A1MP.

                                          Chapter 5

                          1,095 END STRENGTH ACCOUNTING

5.1. Overview. Title 10 U.S.C. § 115, Personnel Strength, requires the Air Force to count ARC
members on ADOS-AC funded tours against active duty end-strength, regardless of rank, when
the cumulative activation time exceeds 1,095 days (3 years) out of the previous 1,460 days (4
years). These tours include active duty under Title 10 U.S.C. § 12301(d), or on full-time
National Guard duty under Title 32 U.S.C. § 502(f)(2) (or any combination thereof) performing
active duty for operational support (ADOS). 1,095 ADOS requirements include Reserve
Personnel Appropriation (RPA) and Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) tours; however,
guidance in this instruction applies to MPA tours only. See AFI 36-2254 Vol 1 for guidance on
RPA tours.
   5.1.1. A member is considered to be in 1,095 status when their cumulative activation time
   will exceed 1,095 days (3 years) out of the previous 1,460 days (4 years) during an upcoming
   MPA tour. In these cases, an approved 1,095 questionnaire is required prior to starting an
   MPA tour. Each 1,095 request has an expiration date and is linked to a specific tour. If
   member does not have a previously disapproved 1,095, and tour does not exceed 29
   September, the Command, Staff, Agency level may approve requests up to 1,400 days.
5.2. 1,095 Roles and Responsibilities
   5.2.1. SAF/MR has approval authority for 1,095 requests affecting end strength reporting
   (30 September). SAF/MR is also the approval authority for previously disapproved/denied
   1,095 questionnaires at Air Force level and for any members with more than 1,400 total
   ADOS days. See Figure 5.1.
   5.2.2. submitter: The unit responsible for submitting the manday allocation request. (T-1).
       5.2.2.1. Coordinate with Supervisor/Commanders (or designated representative) to
       review the ADOS accounting list (in the MPA database) to determine eligibility of
       personnel before assigning the member to a MPA tour. Justification must be provided if
       a member will exceed 1,095 days while on assigned tour. If questionnaire is not
       automatically generated in MPA database, the submitter will manually generate the
       questionnaire. (T-1).
   5.2.3. Functional manager will
       5.2.3.1. Review MPA database generated “730 list” at the beginning of each fiscal year.
       This list identifies members having tours at one location and within the same career field
       for 730 days or more (cumulative or consecutive) within the last 4 years. This review
       assists in determining if this requirement is an “enduring requirement”. If enduring,
       rationale must be provided as to why it is not considered or documented as a full time
       RegAF or civilian requirement as part of the mitigation plan on the questionnaire.
       5.2.3.2. When selecting members for tour, review the ADOS status in MPA database
       which will be updated monthly to show total MPA and ADOS days. This is used to
       determine members 1,095 status. If member has over 1,095 mandays or the tour will
       trigger the member to go over 1,095 mandays, a questionnaire is required. If one is not
       automatically generated by the system one can be manually generated.
32                                                               AFI36-2619 18 JULY 2014


     5.2.3.3. Ensure sufficient justification is provided on the questionnaire prior to
     confirming the questionnaire. Address why this individual is being selected to continue
     or fill this requirement.
     5.2.3.4. Questionnaires must also include a mitigation plan with the current status of any
     long term requirements. Every effort must be made to allocate tours for personnel
     required beyond 29 September, no later than June.
  5.2.4. Command CV, Staff director or Agency deputy director.
     5.2.4.1. Annually review MPA database generated 730 list to determine if consideration
     has been given to documenting as a full time RegAF requirement. (T-2).
     5.2.4.2. Monthly or as needed review all 1,095 threshold requests for recommendation,
     approval and/or denial. Evaluate each 1,095 package and apply approved measures of
     merit provided by SAF/MR and other command related criteria as appropriate. (T-1).
     5.2.4.3. The supported command CV, Staff director or Agency deputy director is the
     approval authority for members with 1,095 days to enter tours not extending beyond 29
     September. Command, staff, agency panel decisions will be documented and made
     available to AF/A1MP monthly. (T-1).Exceptions: Members exceeding 1400 ADOS
     days within the last four years and members who have been disapproved by SAF/MR
     must go thru SAF/MR for approval prior to starting a MPA tour.
     5.2.4.4. Requests for members denied/disapproved in prior fiscal years, regardless of
     tour length, must be submitted to AF/A1M under a signed memo or email by the
     supported Command CV, Staff director or Agency deputy director for SAF/MR
     consideration. (T-1).
     5.2.4.5. Members exceeding 1400 ADOS days within the last four years must be
     submitted to AF/A1M under a signed memo or email by the supported Command CV,
     Staff director or Agency deputy director. (T-1).
  5.2.5. NGB/A1 and AF/REP
     5.2.5.1. Provide AF/A1MP an ADOS listing monthly (on the 5th of each month).
     AF/A1MP will incorporate this information into MPA database to update the members’
     1,095 status.
  5.2.6. AF/A1MP
     5.2.6.1. Annually, in July AF/A1MP will convene a review panel to include, at
     minimum, representatives from AF/A1, AF/REP, NGB/A1P and SAF/MR to evaluate
     each 1,095 package and apply approved measures of merit for end strength consideration.
     5.2.6.2. Prepare annual panel results for SAF/MR approval/denial; notify command,
     staff/agency NLT mid-July.
     5.2.6.3. Monthly, by the 15th of the month convene a review panel with representatives
     from AF/A1, AF/REP, NGB/A1P and SAF/MR to evaluate each 1,095 package from
     members with over 1,400 ADOS days or who have been previously denied.
     5.2.6.4. Prepare monthly panel results for SAF/MR approval/denial; notify command,
     staff/agency NLT the middle of each month.
AFI36-2619 18 JULY 2014                                                                      33

       for command, staffs/agencies.
5.3. AF Mission Prioritization for 1,095
   5.3.1. AF Mission Priority 1. ARC members whose total tours are located in a combat zone
   (combat zone tax relief area IAW DoD Financial Management Regulation Volume 7A,
   Chapter 44 Section 440103) for the duration of the applicable operations. If members are
   performing this mission in the AOR questionnaires are approved automatically.
   5.3.2. AF Mission Priority 2. ARC members directly supporting combat. If members are
   performing this mission in the AOR questionnaires are approved automatically, if mission is
   performed in the outside the AOR (CONUS or other OCONUS locations) the appropriate
   review is required at command or Air Force level.
   5.3.3. AF Mission Priority 3. ARC members supporting SecDef contingency operations, the
   appropriate command, staff/agency or Air Force level review is required.
   5.3.4. AF Mission Priority 4. ARC members backfilling RegAF members who are deployed
   forward, the appropriate command, staff/agency or Air Force level review is required.
   5.3.5. AF Mission Priority 5. ARC members on Air Force Operational Support Orders, the
   appropriate command, staff/agency or Air Force level review is required.
5.4. 1,095 ADOS Approval Authority and Process
   5.4.1. Approval to serve in active duty status past 1,095 days within the previous 1,460 days
   must be granted by the approval authority prior to the start of the tour or extension of the
   tour.
   5.4.2. Unless otherwise delegated, the Secretary of the Air Force is the approval authority
   for general officers. Requests for approvals must be coordinated with AF/DPG, AF/A1,
   SAF/GC and SAF/MR. General officers must comply with 10 USC § 526 and 10 USC §
   12004.
   5.4.3. Supported Command CVs, staff directors or agency equivalents are the approval
   authority for members O-6 and below whose tours end on or before 29 September; and have
   less than 1,400 total ADOS and who have not been disapproved during the previous fiscal
   year. Reach back to the supported CCDRs and/or ARC during validation of the 1,095 is
   encouraged.
       5.4.3.1. Supported Commands/staffs/agencies will conduct monthly reviews prior to
       placing members in 1,095 status on tour. (T-2)
       5.4.3.2. Members will be identified by name and mission duty on a memo or email
       endorsed by the supported Command CV, staff directors or agency equivalents. (T-2).
       5.4.3.3. Minimum Measures of Merit for Command Review at Table 5.1. These
       measures are automatically calculated in the database when entering the MPA tour
       information. Stressed AFSC is a weighted factor since the RegAF has a greater need for
       augmentation in those career fields. Stressed AFSC list is updated and posted to the
       AFPC web site at least twice a year.

AFI36-2619 18 JULY 2014                                                                      35


       command MMOs verify the mission is the same and then update the database and send an
       e-mail to AF/A1MP requesting an update to waiver status to allocate the tour. (T-1).
5.5. 1,095 Related Issues:
   5.5.1. Ongoing, long-term MPA requirements must be reviewed for the proper resource
   actions. Potential alternate sourcing options should be addressed in mitigation plan (i.e.,
   programmed or requesting AC end-strength increase, Active Guard Reserve or civilian
   requirement increase).
   5.5.2. If ARC augmentation is the best resource to fill this requirement, commanders must
   expand opportunities to other ARC volunteers.
   5.5.3. All members approaching 18 years of TAFMS must have a signed sanctuary waiver
   before a tour is allocated (waiver can be signed for 179 days). Annotate sanctuary
   requirements in the 1,095 questionnaires. (T-1).
5.6. Key Dates for 1,095 ADOS Accounting Process
   5.6.1. Monthly: Supported commands, staffs/agency panels convene to evaluate 1,095
   threshold requests; submit any HAF requests (members previously denied by SAF/MR or
   members with more than 1400 total ADOS days) by the 5th of the month. Decisions
   forwarded back to commands by the 15th of the month. Note: In order to allow time for the
   SAF panel to review packages and SAF coordination as well as notification to member;
   submit package 60 days prior to tour start. (T-1).
   5.6.2. 1 June: For members with 1,095 on tour beyond 29 September, supporting
   commands, staffs, and agencies forward their approved prioritized non-AEF 1,095 Threshold
   Requests to AF/A1M. (T-1).
   5.6.3. 1 July: Supported commands, staffs and agencies review total ADOS time for
   members who will be on tour after 1 October to determine which members will attain 1,095
   and/or 1,400 status during the next fiscal year. (T-1).
   5.6.4. 16 July: Supported commands, staffs, and agencies notified of all request dispositions
   for their prioritized submissions. Members denied 1,095 request for 30 September or beyond,
   must be off tour NLT 29 September. (T-1).
   5.6.5. Requests for SAF/MR reconsideration will be an exception, not the norm. All
   requests for reconsideration must be approved by the supported command CV or staff/agency
   directors or deputies and forwarded to AF/A1MP for review and recommendation and
   approval by SAF/MR.

                           MISCELLANEOUS MPA ACTIONS

6.1. AEF MPA Process
   6.1.1. The Air Force presents its forces via an Air & Space Expeditionary Task Force
   (AETF). Since a substantial capability resides in the ARC, the AF relies on its Total Force to
   meet its taskings. AETF requirements are validated CCDR-requests that have been ordered
   by the SECDEF on active Joint Manning Documents or through Requests for Forces (RFFs)
   that appear in the Global Force Management Allocation Plan (GFMAP). There are two types
   of activation “volunteerism” and “involuntary recall to Active Duty”.
   6.1.2. Roles and Responsibilities
      6.1.2.1. AFPC/DPW will provide ACC/A3O with the ANG and AFRC planned Agile
      Combat Support (ACS) participation as identified in the ACS Planning Schedule.
      Planned participation will be submitted via unclassified email channels using the AEF
      Manday Tour Requirement Template (Attachment 5) as soon as possible after receipt of
      the AFRC and ANG proposed planned ACS requirements.
      6.1.2.2. ACC/A3O will provide the accepted ACS participation plan by component in
      the approved template format via unclassified email channels to ACC/A1RR, no later
      than 20 days after accepting the ARC planned requirement. Prior to tasking of AEF
      mission requirements to the ARC the ACC/A3O must ensure a Military Interagency
      Purchase Request (MIPR) is prepared to confirm funding exists to support tasked
      member’s travel and transportation per diem costs associated with the AEF ACS
      participation plan.
      6.1.2.3. ACC/A1RR is the MMO and is responsible for building the AEF ACS
      participation requirements in their POM submission to AF/A1MP. A1RR will task the
      AEF ACS requirement to the ARC Force Provider Center [ANGRC or AFR FGC]
      accordingly once AEF ACS requirements are validated and mandays provided by
      AF/A1MP.
      6.1.2.4. Flying Mission Support will be accomplished by the respective Major Command
      (MAJCOM) with the required weapon system to accommodate the necessary air support
      to the AEF. The CAF/MAF Scheduling Integrated Product Teams will inform their
      MAJCOM MMOs of ARC sourcing solutions for inclusion in their POM submission to
      AF/A1MP.
      6.1.2.5. The AFR FGC and ANGRC will: Ensure AEF volunteers who will exceed the
      1,095 threshold during the tour and are not provided an automatic extension by SAF/MR
      policy and have appropriately justified questionnaires, which includes clear efforts taken
      to find volunteers without this limitation.
          6.1.2.5.1. Ensure AEF volunteers obtain an approved per diem waiver prior to
          departure on AEF tour.
          6.1.2.5.2. Ensure the only training authorized is training accompanied in the line
          remarks as CCDR-directed training identified by AETC/A3O and published annually.
 38                                                                  AFI36-2619 18 JULY 2014


      6.1.2.6. Tasked unit will ensure volunteer’s SSN is in DCAPES IAW timelines
      established in AFI 36-3802. Units also responsible for completing the Unit AEF Tasking
      page or IMA page in AF directed MPA manday data system and submitting to the
      respective ARC section for validation.          Indicate in the notes whether 1,095
      registration/per diem waiver is appropriate and accomplished. Activated airmen in
      support of contingencies may receive activation orders up to 180 days prior to tour start
      date after receiving proper allocation message. (T-1).
          6.1.2.6.1. Members deployed on AEF tours are eligible to take their leave at the end
          of the tour or carry their leave forward. If leave is being carried forward then tour
          must be curtailed by the amount of leave carried forward.
6.2. Pregnancy
   6.2.1. An ARC member determined to be pregnant while serving on active duty orders
   ordinarily shall be permitted to serve through the full term of those orders as long as they are
   qualified to continue to perform the active duty requirement for which originally selected.
   Pregnancy is not considered a line of duty condition and extension of orders solely for the
   basis of the pregnancy is not authorized. If pregnancy complications occur, the member will
   be referred to the medical treatment facility for consultation without making adjustments to
   tour requirements.
   6.2.2. If the member is determined to be pregnant after the start of an active duty tour, the
   supported commander having operational control (OPCON) over the member may curtail
   service, if, after receiving duty limitation/restriction recommendations in accordance with
   established guidelines, determines that duty limitations and/or restrictions for that member
   are not consistent with the specific purpose of the orders under which the member is serving.
   After receiving the AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report, from the servicing MTF,
   the supported commander will determine if the duty limitation will prevent the member from
   performing the duty required under the MPA manday orders. If the supported commander
   determines that the duty limitation is not consistent with the duty required, the member’s
   MPA manday orders may be curtailed. If the supporting commander determines that the
   duty limitation does not prevent performance of the required duty, the member’s MPA
   manday orders may continue until 34 weeks of pregnancy. The MPA orders will not be
   extended past 34 weeks of pregnancy. (T-1).
   6.2.3. If the member is determined to be pregnant prior to the start of the active duty tour,
   she may be scheduled for and perform active duty and MPA manday tours at or away from
   her home duty station up to 34 weeks of pregnancy, if, after receiving duty
   limitation/restriction recommendations in accordance with established guidelines, the gaining
   commander determines that duty limitations and/or recommendations for that member are
   consistent with the specific purpose for which the member is to serve. (T-1).
      6.2.3.1. Members who reside within the CONUS are restricted to active duty and
      manday tours in the 48 contiguous states. (T-1).
      6.2.3.2. Members who reside OCONUS are restricted to active duty and manday tours
      OCONUS. (T-1).
   6.2.4. Costs normally associated with maternity and infant care (i.e. medical and surgical
   care incident to pregnancy, including pre-natal care, delivery, post-natal care, treatment of
AFI36-2619 18 JULY 2014                                                                        39


   complications of pregnancy, and inpatient newborn) and post-natal convalescent leave shall
   not be considered when the supported commander is making duty determination. (T-1).
   6.2.5. Activation of duty and/or continued duty until the original expiration date of orders is
   contingent upon the member’s ability to maintain access to obstetric care. Provisions for
   obstetric care must be arranged within a reasonable travel distance of the duty location, as
   determined by a military medical provider. Supported commanders may curtail orders,
   notwithstanding whether the member is able to perform the duties of the orders, if obstetric
   care is not available, if medical personnel are not capable of managing early complications of
   pregnancy, or if the pregnancy is complicated. (T-1).
6.3. Sanctuary (Active Duty)
   6.3.1. Title 10, U.S.C §12686(a) places limits on an ARC member’s release from active duty
   when they are within two years of becoming eligible for active duty retirement. This section
   of law provides protection for the ARC member’s right to an active duty retirement (active
   duty sanctuary). Members on voluntary ADOS tours without an approved sanctuary waiver
   will be accessed to the ARC IAW AFI 36-2131.
   6.3.2. In general, Air Force policy does not permit ARC members to inadvertently slip into
   active duty sanctuary; therefore, ARC members may not perform MPA voluntary tours of
   active duty (TTAD) designated as ADOS without an approved waiver. If an ARC member
   performs a MPA tour of less than 180 days, and the period of AD would result in the member
   qualifying for AD sanctuary, the member may not begin the tour without an approved waiver
   in place prior to the tour start date. Refer to AFI 36-2131 for specific guidance and
   procedures.
   6.3.3. If an ARC member is within two years of becoming eligible for an active duty
   retirement and wishes to perform voluntary MPA (ADOS-AC) or RPA (ADOS-RC) tours,
   then Title 10 U.S.C. §12686(b) provides for a waiver which will allow the ARC member to
   waive the right to invoke sanctuary for periods of active duty (other than for training). When
   a member waives the right to invoke sanctuary, the member is then allowed to perform MPA
   (ADOS/TTAD) and/or RPA (ADOS) tours. Any extension of AD cannot commence without
   an additional waiver for the period of the tour extension.
   6.3.4. For the purposes of voluntary ADOS tours, ARC members who have between 16 ½
   and 20 years TAFMS must sign a sanctuary waiver. (T-1).
6.4. Telecommute
   6.4.1. Telecommute may be authorized in circumstances when active duty mission
   requirements demand specific ARC resources which are not available to perform voluntary
   duty locally. Telecommute may not be approved out of convenience to the member or as a
   mechanism for the organization to avoid funding travel and transportation allowances.
   6.4.2. Tours involving telecommute should specify deliverables required during the manday
   tour and may not be open-ended.
   6.4.3. Organizations employing ARC resources under this method must accomplish a
   telecommute agreement using Department of Defense (DD) Form 2946 and online training at
   http://www.telework.gov. Organizations must maintain a telecommute agreement and
   provide to the supported command FAM if requested. (T-0).

  6.4.4. ARC resources assigned to or performing MPA manday tours with organizations
  belonging to the Headquarters Air Force (Secretariat and Air Staff) should reference and
  comply with guidance outlined in HOI 36-16, Telework. (T-2).
