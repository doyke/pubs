1.2. Authority and Charter
   1.2.1. The Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) is a revolving fund that provides the
   working capital for purchasing inventory supplies and industrial and commercial type
   activities necessary to provide common services within or among departments and agencies
   of the Department of Defense. The DWCF is established under the authority of Title 10,
   United States Code 2208. Within the DWCF, there are two Air Force Working Capital
   Funds (AFWCFs): (a) Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group (CSAG) Maintenance &
   Supply Division and (b) Transportation Activity Group (also known as the Transportation
   Working Capital Fund).
   1.2.2. The Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) is a revolving fund that provides
   initial working capital to support Air Force warfighters and operations, and allows for the
   recovery of operating costs through sales of repair, overhaul, and modification services. It
   conducts business within two primary activity groups: the Consolidated Sustainment
   Activity Group (CSAG) and the Supply Management Activity Group-Retail (SMAG-R).
      1.2.2.1. CSAG (as of FY09) is a new AFWCF business activity that consolidates the
      former Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG) and Material Support Division
      (MSD) business operations into a single business enterprise. Under CSAG, DMAG is
      characterized as the Maintenance Division and MSD is now the Supply Division. CSAG
      Maintenance sites include the ALCs and the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration
      Group (AMARG). This work may also include depot field teams, maintenance
      engineering, technical support, manufacture of parts needed in the depot maintenance
      process, modifications, testing, and reclamation.
      1.2.2.2. The ALCs perform depot-level maintenance and repair of military material
      requiring major overhaul, complete rebuild, or other high-order repair work for end items
      (including weapon systems), subsystems, parts, assemblies, and subassemblies. The 525
      EMSX, Support Center Pacific (Kadena AB), provides depot level aircraft and industrial
      component test, repair, overhaul, and fabrication support to Pacific Air Force (PACAF)
      and inter-service organizations. Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group
      (AMARG) also does depot maintenance work, mainly related to reclamation activities.

      1.2.2.3. SMAG-R is composed of three divisions – General Support, Medical-Dental,
      and United States Air Force Academy – that are responsible for providing logistics
      support services including requirements forecasting, item introduction, cataloging,
      provisioning, procurement, repair, technical support, data management, item disposal,
      distribution management, and transportation. Inventory items managed by SMAG-R
      include weapon system spare parts, medical-dental supplies and equipment, War Reserve
      Materiel (WRM) stockpiles, uniforms, and other supply items used in non-weapon
      system applications.
1.3. Description of DMAPS
   1.3.1. DMAPS is the financial system of record and management information system used to
   support depot maintenance execution at the three ALCs. The DMAPS program is a suite of
   systems and includes interfaces within the suite and with other systems.
   1.3.2. DIFMS is a DoD standard system, which is designed to support financial, accounting,
   and reporting at the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force Depot Maintenance, and Navy Research
   and Development activities. In the Air Force, DIFMS is the official financial system of
   record for depot maintenance. DIFMS maintains general ledgers; records disbursements,
   collections, and customer orders; tracks costs; bills customers; and manages fixed assets; and
   supports other general management functions in depot maintenance. The system interfaces
   with local activity systems as well as standard DoD systems. All higher-level financial
   reporting requirements, except budget formulation are satisfied by the system. Specific uses
   for Air Force and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) operations are defined
   so user access can be properly set and the users can be trained on the screens needed for the
   functions they support.
   1.3.3. The Automated Bill of Material (ABOM) System and the Naval Air Systems
   Command (NAVAIR) Industrial Material Management System (NIMMS) are the DMAPS
   systems used for material processing. ABOM is an Air Force system that provides front-end
   processing for the depot maintenance material system. NIMMS provides information for
   material buys to DIFMS. NIMMS and DIFMS share the same database. ABOM feeds
   transactions to NIMMS and the Wholesale and Retail Receiving and Shipping System
   (D035K-WARRS). ABOM also tracks Due In From and Due Out to Maintenance. United
   States Air Force Integrated Logistics System – Supply (D002A – (ILS-S) formerly known as
   SBSS – Standard Base Supply System) feeds material transaction information to ABOM.
   ILS-S handles indirect material, hazardous material, non-capitalized equipment, and some
   floating stock (spares).
   1.3.4. All screens and programs for DIFMS and NIMMS are identified with a six-digit code:
      1.3.4.1. Position One: Always 'M'
      1.3.4.2. Position Two: System Designator (‘S’ for DIFMS, 'N' for NIMMS)
      1.3.4.3. Position Three: Number of System or Process
      1.3.4.4. Position Four and Five: DIFMS/NIMMS sequence number
      1.3.4.5. Position Six: 'P' for program; ‘J’ for job or run stream. If the last position is not
      a P/J, the reference is to a file.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                      13


  1.3.5. The Time and Attendance System (TAA) captures and interfaces actual labor hours to
  DIFMS. TAA also creates the output file, which is sent to the Defense Civilian Payroll
  System (DCPS) for payroll generation. TAA gets employee civilian rates from DCPS and
  provides this information to DIFMS. Military composite standard pay and reimbursement
  rates are calculated per the DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 11A, Chapter 6,
  Appendix I. The rates are available on the reimbursable rates page of the Office of the
  Undersecretary          of        Defense        (Comptroller)         (OUSD(C)) website
  (http://www.dod.mil/comptroller/rates). Refer to AFMCI 21-136 for production labor
  policy and procedures, the TAA User Manual for detailed user operations, and Chapter 3 of
  this instruction for the financial policy and procedures related to labor.
  1.3.6. The DMAPS-IE (Integration Engine) contains eight interrelated components:
     1.3.6.1. Conversion Engine (CONEN). CONEN facilitates the movement and
     translation of data between the DMAPS suite of systems and other systems. Note:
     sometimes the acronym for CONEN is shown as CE; use these acronyms
     interchangeably.
     1.3.6.2. Cost, Production, and Budget Module (CPBM-H033). The H033 DMAPS
     application consists of the Cost and Production Performance Module (CPPM), the CPPM
     Maintenance Module, and the Budget Target Module (BTM). Cost Transfer Module
     (CTM) functionality is part of BTM. CPPM is a management information system that
     provides Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group (CSAG) - Maintenance financial and
     production information as well as essential performance indicators to each ALC manager.
     CPPM reports support these managers by providing online, day-to-day visibility of their
     operating costs and production performance, allowing managers to compare actual results
     with the financial budget and production targets. BTM is an automated CSAG -
     Maintenance budgeting tool that, when used in conjunction with the actual historical data
     captured in the CPPM, permits multiple iterations of the budget/target development
     process, as well as production and expense ‘what-if’ scenarios.
     1.3.6.3. DMAPS Data Store System (DDS). DDS is a persistent data store for
     historical data elements, which are either not held by the DMAPS suite of systems or not
     held on a long-term basis. DDS also is a relational database repository allowing a variety
     of functional end users to inquire and retrieve production information.
     1.3.6.4. Employee Identification Generator or Employee ID Generator (EIG). EIG
     is used by the TAA system Office of Prime Responsibility’s (OPR’s) to generate a unique
     six-digit number for each maintenance employee. The selected user can enter new
     employees into the system, generate their User ID, and change employee data. Ogden
     generates an “E” number; Robins generates a “J” number; and Tinker generates a “D”
     number.
     1.3.6.5. Funding Initiation Tool System (FIT). FIT is an on-line, interactive tool that
     allows selected users to review, expand, and record customer funding into DIFMS.
     1.3.6.6. Job Order Status Tool (JOST). JOST provides a multi-record batch update
     capability whereby selected users may change the Job Order Number (JON) status from
     open to financially closed. The overriding function of this tool is to eliminate the need to
     close JONs in DIFMS manually, one JON at a time.
 14                                                             AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      1.3.6.7. Resource Control Center Skill Code System (RSCS). RSCS is a relational
      database repository allowing designated users to establish and maintain relationships
      between Resource Control Centers (RCCs) and Skill Codes. RCCs comprise the
      financial organization and Skill Codes comprise the work qualifications. Note: that
      sometimes the acronym for RSCS is shown as RSC; use these acronyms interchangeably
      1.3.6.8. Sales Price Generator System (SPG). SPG generates End Item Sales Price
      (EISP) for permanent production numbers, excluding aircraft. SPG has the capability to
      determine type workload by referencing on the last digit of the Project Order Number
      (PON) that is included in the files that DDS pushes to SPG. SPG will only price a
      workload type of 3, 4, 6, and 7 so aircraft workload (type 1) is ignored.
          1.3.6.8.1. Inputs into SPG include Q302/E046B (labor standards), G004C (RCC
          hourly rates), and Q302/G005M (material standards). The system provides for
          material inflation/deflation with one percentage value per ALC and individual EISP
          adjustment (Production Number (PDN)/RCC) until frozen.
          1.3.6.8.2. SPG processes and updates Cost History. It sends Labor Standards by
          PDN and Section to G019C, outputs labor standards to Q302/G004L and Standard
          Hours by RCC to G019C every month.
      1.3.6.8.3. The frozen EISP process occurs semiannually. When Phase I has been frozen,
      outputs are created and sent to both G019C and Q310. Then again, when Phase II has
      been frozen, outputs to G019C and Q310 must be created before the function that allows
      the SPG OPR to send the Sales Price Master (SPM) to Q302/G004L will become
      available.
   1.3.7. Access to a DMAPS-IE component Graphic User Interface (GUI) must be granted to
   the users of EIG, FIT, JOST, RSC, and SPG before they can fully utilize these applications.
   The DMAPS Integration Engine User Access Application OPRs have to associate the user ID
   with the appropriate system in what is referred to as the "User Access Tool" or UAT. For
   example, in the case of SPG, the OPR has to identify the type of access the user is authorized
   to have: Read Only, Transaction Maintenance or Administration. The Planning
   Organization Planners Technician Code (POPTC) has to be selected also or the user will not
   be able to view the data within the reports in SPG for that specific planning organization.
   1.3.8. The DFAS Integration Engine (DFAS-IE) facilitates the exchange of data between the
   DFAS financial legacy systems and DIFMS. This includes the General Accounting and
   Finance System (GAFS-BL/BQ (H069)) for Obligations, Accounts Payable, Disbursements,
   and Collections.
   1.3.9. Additional information regarding the DIFMS system can be obtained from
   attachments to this regulation. The most current information can be obtained from the
   Technical                   Service              Organization’s               website:
   https://t6800.csd.disa.mil/DifmsPortal/index.php. Please click on the “DIFMS” tab and
   then on the current production release.

      operating policies and procedures.
1.5. System Management
   1.5.1. The ALCs must manage and sustain operation of the DMAPS suite and related feeder
   system processing in the standard configuration controlled by the DMAPS program office.
   Sites may not modify these standard systems/processes or add functionality without written
   approval of AFMC/FM and AFMC/A4.
   1.5.2. Air Base Wing (ABW)/SC appoints system managers for each DMAPS-suite system.
   Functional managers are designated by the appropriate ALC organization.
 16                                                             AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


   1.5.3. ABW/SC is responsible for effective and accurate processing of information.
   1.5.4. ALC/FM and the ALC Maintenance Wing Group Financial Managers are responsible
   for accuracy and analysis of the information. ABW/SC has a corollary responsibility for the
   accuracy of the information.
   1.5.5. ABW/SC has a corollary responsibility for the accuracy of the information.
   1.5.6. AFSC/FZR and DFAS are responsible for reporting of the information.
1.6. Continuity of Operation
   1.6.1. AFSC/FZR, ABW/SC, ALC/FM and the ALC Maintenance Wing Group Financial
   Managers must plan to continue operations when the systems, or segments of the systems,
   are temporarily not operating. If data is inappropriately modified or destroyed, procedures
   must be in place to recover. The plans and procedures must be tested periodically (at least
   every two years) under realistic operational conditions per Department of Defense Directive
   (DoDD) 3020.26, Department of Defense Continuity Programs, Section 8.c.
   1.6.2. AFMC/FM in coordination with AFSC/FZR/FM, ABW/SC, and other organizations,
   such as Defense Information Services Agency (DISA), establishes a program for developing
   and testing contingency to ensure that system security controls function reliably and, if not,
   that adequate backup functions are in place to ensure that security functions are maintained
   continuously during interrupted service. AFSC/FZR/FM and the ABW/SC develop and
   update the site contingency plan, conduct tests of the plan in coordination with DFAS and
   DISA, and implement the plan when circumstances require.
   1.6.3. Refer to contingency operations procedures required and in use at the sites as well as
   AFMC procedures in this area. The objective of contingency planning is to provide
   reasonable continuity of system support if events occur that prevent normal operations.
1.7. System Access
   1.7.1. ABW/SC or AFSC/FZR must control access for users to the DMAPS suite of systems
   to assure adequate security. Access to screens must be limited to those required for the
   duties of the individuals and those required to assure proper separation of duties. Any
   individual requesting access to the DMAPS suite must process a System Authorization
   Access Request (SAAR – DoD Form 2875) through their security channels, before
   presenting it to the ABW/SC or AFSC/FZR.
   1.7.2. ABW/SC or AFSC/FZR will coordinate with the systems office in DFAS to obtain
   DIFMS system and screen access. The individual employee requests DIFMS access, change,
   or deletion by filling out a SAAR and submitting to ABW/SC Terminal Area Security
   Officer (TASO). Procedures are defined in the Defense Finance and Accounting System
   (DFAS) Automated Information System (AIS) Security Procedures Guide. Initial access will
   be granted to “view” screens only. “Update” access must be requested in writing (e-mail)
   from the appropriate supervisor and AFSC/FZR supervisor approval.
   1.7.3. ABW/SC system administrators set system access for TAA, ABOM/NIMMS, and
   DMAPS-IE modules based on receipt of an approved SAAR. Screen access will be granted
   as required based on job duties.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                        17


   1.7.4. ABW/SC and AFSC/FZR validate user access by reviewing the user access lists from
   DFAS Information and Technology (DFASI&T) Organization and DISA on the DMAPS
   systems. Check to ensure listed users have a need for access to the system, have access to
   only those areas for which they have a need, and have the appropriate level of access.
   1.7.5. ABW/SC          and        AFSC/FZR      use      DFAS        I&T's       portal
   (https://t6800.csd.disa.mil/DifmsPortal/IAO/dd2875.php ) for entering helpdesk
   processing and concerns for DIFMS, ABOM, and NIMMS. All DMAPS discrepancies and
   requests for system changes must be entered into the Problem Tracking System (PTS)
   portion of the Information System Management Tool (ISMT) by the originator
   (https://www.ismt.wpafb.af.mil ). These entries are worked and addressed as determined
   by the problem severity and type.
1.8. DMAPS Financial Processing and Control
   1.8.1. Close coordination, cooperation and communication between AFSC/FZR, ALC/FM
   and the ALC Maintenance Wing Financial Managers are essential to assure effectiveness of
   financial operations. The corresponding organizations at AFMC headquarters (e.g.,
   AFMC/FM and AFMC/A4) must also provide pro-active support to their Center Complex
   counterparts. Center AFSC/FZR, ABW/SC, ALC/FM and the ALC Maintenance Wing share
   responsibility for the control requirements covered in the following paragraphs.
   1.8.2. Data integrity must be a management priority to include timely correction of errors,
   documentation, and internal controls.
      1.8.2.1. Assure integrity of DMAPS data entries by implementing procedures as covered
      in this AFMCI and providing for correction of rejects and documentation of transactions,
      so there is a trail to the source. Set up an effective internal control environment to assure
      data quality, safeguard assets, and provide for management control.
      1.8.2.2. Interaction for labor (e.g., TAA), material (e.g., NIMMS) and business
      operations other cost (e.g., DMAPS-IE) is automated. Sometimes transactions from these
      systems reject or there is a mismatch requiring research. Corrections should be input into
      the originating system but sometimes may need to be made in DIFMS or other systems.
   1.8.3. DMAPS provides audit trails and maintains records to trace transactions from the
   source documents, original input, changes and corrections, other systems, system-generated
   transactions, and internal assignment transactions through the system. A complete audit trail
   allows all transactions to be traced from the source records and documents (including
   changes and corrections) to the Subsidiary and General Ledgers in DIFMS and to the
   financial statements and vice versa. DMAPS also provides audit trails and retains records to
   identify changes made to system parameters and tables that affect processing or reprocessing
   of any financial transactions. The audit trails should identify the document input, changes,
   deletions, and approvals by the originator. Supporting documentation forms the basis of the
   transaction histories to create audit trails, and the documentation must be maintained.
   1.8.4. Interfaces between the system of original input and any other system must be
   electronic and not have any manual intervention, unless such intervention is a part of the
   DMAPS system design. The interfaces between systems must be documented and controlled
   and DMAPS as a whole must ensure the timely and complete transmission of transactions
   and financial related data. Much of this documentation is available in system manuals.
18                                                               AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


  1.8.5. The DMAPS systems have the means and procedures to detect and report errors. The
  ALC must assure these errors are corrected in a timely manner and within the appropriate
  processing cycle and fiscal year. Management must assure procedures are in place and
  working to analyze error reports so that system and processing improvements can be made.
  Self-inspection checklists are used for validation of file data accuracy. Management
  validates that system computations use appropriate data and achieve the intended result.
  1.8.6. AFSC/FZR uses DIFMS reports from the weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual
  processes to reconcile general ledger and subsidiary accounts. AFSC/FZR must take action
  to coordinate, research, and correct any significant differences.
  1.8.7. Within user operations, maintain separation of duties and responsibilities for initiating,
  authorizing, processing, recording, and reviewing transactions. This separation of duties
  should be such that no single individual can control a transaction from beginning to end. The
  division should provide for a separation among (1) the functions of initiation and
  authorization of a transaction, (2) the recording of the transaction, and (3) the custody of the
  resultant asset. AFSC/FZR/FM and ALC Maintenance Wing Financial Managers shall
  maintain a record of the approach used for assuring the duties are separated.
  1.8.8. Controls have been instituted to ensure that reports containing sensitive or Privacy Act
  information are secured and properly destroyed when no longer needed.
  1.8.9. Under the direction of AFMC/FM, perform annual evaluations to determine whether
  use of DIFMS conforms to control requirements and this directive. The review should
  include transaction testing of the critical aspects of the system. The transaction testing
  should cover the entire flow of transactions from initial authorization through processing and
  reporting.
  1.8.10. The ALCs are to use query languages as query tools only and not to update or change
  data. The use of query tools to update or change data bypasses normal system transaction
  controls and, often, does not create an acceptable audit trail. Database changes/requests to
  DIFMS/NIMMS or any of the DMAPS systems should be the rare exception, required only
  for unusual circumstances such as significant system failure. Under no circumstances may
  query languages be used to change financial results, such as moving costs from job orders
  with lower funding than actual cost. The following procedures need to be used for obtaining
  approval to use query languages for processing updates to any of the DMAPS program
  systems.
     1.8.10.1. The requestor in coordination with the development activity (e.g., Defense
     Finance and Accounting Service Information and Technology (DFAS I&T) – for
     DIFMS/NIMMS), proposes changes to data through query updates. When changes may
     affect files used by other organizations, such as DFAS, representatives of the other
     organizations must be notified.
     1.8.10.2. Before processing any query updates, at a minimum obtain documented
     approval of the appropriate ALC system manager for each Structured Query Language
     (SQL). For example, DIFMS query updates need the approval of the ALC Chief of Cost
     Accounting at a minimum.
     1.8.10.3. Following local approval, enter a Data Cleansing Request (DCR) into the
     DMAPS Problem Tracking System (PTS). Input an action request into the Remedy
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                       19


      Action Request System (ARS), which routes the request for query language update to
      DFAS I&T. The DMAPS Program Office (AFMC/A4NL) assures the DCR is reviewed
      under the configuration management program and provided to the DMAPS-IE supplier to
      determine whether a corresponding change must be made to DDS to keep DDS in sync
      and in balance. The DCR also is a source for system improvements.
      1.8.10.4. Documentation must be retained for the query (e.g., SQL) change for a specific
      time per regulatory requirements and archiving rules. The documentation includes a
      complete explanation of the query update. At a minimum, the document must contain:
          1.8.10.4.1. Rationale for the change
          1.8.10.4.2. Files and tables affected
          1.8.10.4.3. Amounts of the changes (including pre- and post-query processing)
          1.8.10.4.4. Date processed and period affected
          1.8.10.4.5. Whether the query update is one-time or recurring
          1.8.10.4.6. Copy of the query code
          1.8.10.4.7. A statement that the query does not change financial results
          1.8.10.4.8. Reasons that normal system processing cannot be used
          1.8.10.4.9. Individual (name, office symbol, email, and telephone) requesting,
          approving, coordinating and processing the change
   1.8.11. The AFSC/FZR and ALC/FM will establish a comprehensive set of financial
   measures for periodic review of the quality and timeliness of financial processing, to include
   for example suspended labor transactions or material in transit. The metrics program must
   cover the full scope of DMAPS financial processing. Local procedures will be issued to
   ensure metrics are established so the program covers the full scope of financial processing to
   include Manage Funding, Account for Funds and Manage Cash, Collect/Track Cost/Expense
   (Labor, Material and Business Operations), Manage Plant Property, Transfer Cost and
   Adjust, Billing and Analyze/Reconcile/Report.
   1.8.12. Write-off or significant adjustments of transactions should be the exception to 1.8.11,
   and the user must obtain approval through the Chief of Cost Accounting or appropriate level
   supervision. The Chief of Cost Accounting maintains records of the quantity and dollar
   value of write-offs. Local procedures will be published monthly to ensure write-offs are
   identified by specific category, and these procedures will identify who will maintain and
   report the quantity and dollar value of these write-offs. For write-off or adjustment policy,
   guidance and procedures refer to the DoD FMR, Volume 4, Accounting Policy and
   Procedures, and DoD FMR, Volume 11B, Reimbursable Policies and Procedures for
   Working Capital Funds.
1.9. System Documentation
   1.9.1. Coverage, at a minimum, must include: maintain accounting policies, processes, and
   procedures in this directive (and other media) such as the process model. Document major
   sources of data provided to DIFMS with actions required for data processing. Describe
   aspects of the system such as the account structure and definitions; transaction codes; the
20                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


  accounting cycles and procedures; transaction and data flow; and the necessary coordination
  needed with other groups or systems. Describe, in detail, the effect of all transactions on the
  Subsidiary or General ledgers. Assure that adequate physical security is provided for all
  information collected, processed, transmitted, stored or disseminated.
  1.9.2. AFMC/FM (in conjunction with AFMC/A4) assures current system and process
  documentation is available for the AFSC/FM, and ALCs Centers Complexes to supplement
  and expand upon the documentation in this directive.
  1.9.3. The documentation should be of sufficient scope and depth to provide managers,
  users, systems operators, and software maintenance personnel with an understanding of the
  design and operation of each component in the system and its integration with and relation to
  all other components.
  1.9.4. The totality of user documentation is in sufficient detail to permit a person with a
  general knowledge of the agency's programs and systems to obtain a comprehensive
  understanding of the entire operation of the system. The documentation must be current and
  cover the system's development and actual operations. This includes system user manuals,
  operating instructions, and database management manuals. The most current information can
  be      obtained     from      the     Technical      Service    Organization’s    website:
  https://t6800.csd.disa.mil/DifmsPortal/index.php. Please click on the “DIFMS” tab and
  the radio button and then on the current production release.
1.10. DMAPS Change Management
  1.10.1. This instruction is to document the DMAPS approach to requirements management.
  This document provides a description of the Configuration Management (CM) process for
  DMAPS. The intent is to ensure the use of a streamlined and well-disciplined methodology
  to maintain and revise process and system baselines. The process described in this document
  enables the AFMC Program Management Office (PMO) for DMAPS to effectively manage
  and improve the DMAPS requirements and associated data systems configurations. This
  policy provides the guiding principles and steps that must be followed to translate user
  requirements into process and data system changes. This process covers all DMAPS-related
  processing, including financial.
  1.10.2. All changes affecting DMAPS are documented in the PTS module of the Information
  System Management Tool (ISMT). The potential process changes to DMAPS are
  categorized by the following:
     1.10.2.1. Discrepancy Report (DR) – When a system does not adequately support an
     approved business process, with the current design, it is viewed as a deficiency. (Per
     AFMC/A4 direction)
     1.10.2.2. Software Problem Report (SPR) – Deficiencies written during test against un-
     fielded software.
     1.10.2.3. Baseline Change Request (BCR) – Business Process Change or new
     functionality/requirement that drives software change.
     1.10.2.4. Information Support Report (ISR) – Issues needing further research/resolution
     by either functional experts or suppliers, if required.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                      21


       1.10.2.5. Data Cleansing Request (DCR) – Changes to databases, scripts, etc. (not
       application software changes).
   1.10.3. Review boards supporting identification, coordination, review and approval of
   problem reports are shown in the following paragraph.
       1.10.3.1. Discrepancy Review Board (DRB) - The DRB determines the validity and
       severity level of all problems. When justified, reports are written against the DMAPS
       applications software before submission to the applicable FRB. From the FRB it is then
       sent to the software supplier for their resolution. Disposition of ISRs/DCRs is
       determined by the DRB. ISRs document investigation/research only and are not used to
       deliver application software changes. DCRs document changes to databases, scripts, etc.,
       and are not used to deliver application software changes.
       1.10.3.2. Functional Review Board (FRB) - The purpose of the Functional Review Board
       (FRB) is to operate as a single point of control for changes to application systems. There
       are five FRBs: Financial, Material, Production, Integration Engine and Reports. The
       types of changes include the following: discrepancy reports, baseline change requests,
       information support reports, or upcoming changes requested by users. The objective is
       for each requirement to be reviewed, scrubbed, and fully coordinated with all affected
       offices and the required documentation created. The system changes are prioritized in
       relation to all other prior documented changes that have been ranked by the FRB. These
       are then planned for future block testing and release.
       1.10.3.3. There are External Boards that affect DMAPS requirements. DIFMS/NIMMS
       User Group has representatives from Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and DFAS. The
       User Group provides information to the DIFMS/NIMMS Joint Configuration Control
       Board (CCB). The DIFMS/NIMMS Joint CCB negotiates and prioritizes requirements
       for block releases.
       1.10.3.4. The DMAPS CCB approves documentation changes using the DMAPS Change
       Request (CR) form. When deficiencies drive a technical change, a DMAPS CR form is
       also used and approved by the DMAPS CCB. Severity 1-2 DRs are software deficiencies
       that require immediate changes to support the DMAPS business process and are approved
       by the DMAPS CCB.
       1.10.3.5. Integrated Requirements Review Board (IRRB) – All Baseline Change
       Requests (BCRs) and Severity 3 – 5 Deficiency Requests require approval through the
       IRRB. These requests must be submitted through the Requirements Document Tracking
       Module of Information System Management Tool (ISMT) with information through Tab
       R being completed prior to submission.
1.10.3.5.1. The Initial submission will be through the Communications and Information Systems
Requirements Document (CSRD) Validation process. The submission will be reviewed to see if
all necessary information has been provided to determine if the requirement is valid.
1.10.3.5.2. During the CSRD Validation, the Major Command (MAJCOM) Portfolio Manager
(PfM) gives site approval to the requirement.
   1.10.4. Procedures for notification of DMAPS system releases follow:
       1.10.4.1. Emergency Releases:
 22                                                               AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


           1.10.4.1.1. DMAPS PMO CM is notified by email from Defense Finance and
           Accounting Service Information and Technology (DFAS I&T) software supplier
           showing programs affected and date/time stamp of the change.
           1.10.4.1.2. DMAPS PMO CM verifies the date and time stamp in the staging area.
           1.10.4.1.3. DMAPS PMO CM emails site configuration managers at each ALC, as
           well as the Production Leads at each ALC, Test Team at OC, and functional people at
           AFSC/FZR and ALCs who have requested to be notified. Decision is made whether
           test is in test environment, production environment, or both.
           1.10.4.1.4. ALC decides to install and coordinates with DISA to install the release.
           Releases are also briefed at the daily DRB telecom by DMAPS PMO CM. The ABW
           SC schedulers, DMAPS PMO and functional folks at the AFCS/ALCs and suppliers
           attend the DRB.
       1.10.4.2. Routine Release to Interfacing Systems:
           1.10.4.2.1. PMO CM receives notification from the software supplier that software-
           affecting DMAPS is in the inbound staging area with a copy of the Software Release
           Technical Letter (SRTL) or other information on release content.
           1.10.4.2.2. DMAPS CM versions the software in the inbound staging area and moves
           it to the DMAPS software library.
           1.10.4.2.3. DMAPS CM moves the software to the installation staging area to be
           installed in test.
1.10.4.2.4. DMAPS CM emails on-site CM and Test Lead that the software is ready for
installation. After successful test, software is staged for release to production. ALC decides to
install and coordinates with DISA to install the release.
           1.10.4.2.5. Release is briefed at the daily DRB.
       1.10.4.3. Routine Releases in DMAPS-Suite Systems:
           1.10.4.3.1. A Version Description Document and “ReadMe First” document is
           provided for each release.
           1.10.4.3.2. All potential changes are documented in the Information System
           Management Tool’s (ISMT) Problem Tracking System (PTS). The ALCs can track
           problems from initiation to closure via PTS.
           1.10.4.3.3. When a problem report is written, it is presented to the DRB and
           distributed in accordance with the DMAPS process, i.e., DRB – Functional Teams –
           Integrated Requirements Review Board (IRRB)/Configuration Control Board (CCB)
           – Functional Review Board (FRB) – Supplier.
1.11. Archiving of Financial Data
   1.11.1. Per the DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume I, Chapter 9, the ALC must retain financial
   information per the requirements of the Federal regulations established by the National
   Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which is responsible for promulgating
   procedures for the disposal of all U.S. Government records. General polices can be found in
   sections 1220-1238 of Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). In addition,
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     23


  specific records disposal direction, which is mandatory per 44 U.S.C. 3303a is contained in
  the General Records Schedules (GRS), which are issued by the NARA to provide disposal
  authorization guidance for administrative records, including fiscal accounting records. The
  GRS are available at: http://archives.gov/records-mgmt on the Internet.
  1.11.2. In accordance with the NARA regulations, AFMC/FM sets standards to define
  specifically the DMAPS data types to be retained, periods of retention, and related access
  requirements. ALCs implement the standards set by AFMC/FM.
  1.11.3. DIFMS periodically purges data from the database via scheduled processing.
  Instructions are provided by Defense Finance and Accounting Service Information and
  Technology (DFAS I&T) prior to the start of the closing of each fiscal year. Reports are
  created and the data used to build the reports are ‘canned’ not archived. For example, for Job
  Order Number(JON), Customer Order Number(CON), and Sponsor Order Number(SPON)
  purges, the funding document has to be final billed for at least 60 days and the JON, CON,
  SPON, and Funding Document must be closed in DIFMS (Status Code-3).
  1.11.4. Once data is no longer required, DIFMS provides history reports, which serve as an
  audit trail for such items as Sponsor Orders, Customer Orders, Job Orders, Asset/Liability
  Records, Material Requisitions, and Billing and Cash transactions. Retention of these history
  reports for the required period is the first source of archived information. Current
  information regarding DIFMS policies for their Purge and History subsystem can be obtained
  from           the        Technical          Service         Organization’s         website:
  https://t6800.csd.disa.mil/DifmsPortal/index.php. Please click on the “DIFMS” tab and
  then on the current production release, then Purge and History User Manual.
  1.11.5. Data from the DDS also can be used for archiving of financial data. Policy states the
  retention of DDS data is maintained one year for online transaction level detail and two years
  for task level summaries and above. Additionally, the ALC/FM, in coordination with
  AFMC/FM, decides on what information should be extracted from DDS and retained for the
  required retention period, which is as long as six years and three months per NARA
  requirements (see archiving paragraph).
     1.11.5.1. By using data mining tools, the DDS has the capability to retrieve selectively
     archived data based on user-defined criteria such as date or accounting period. In
     addition, the DDS “History” function can be used to retrieve information.
     1.11.5.2. DDS provides the capability to retrieve selectively archived data based on user-
     defined criteria such as date, accounting period, or job order. The DDS administrator has
     the capability to control the archiving process. DDS also has the capability to establish
     and maintain user-defined archival criteria, such as date, accounting period, closed items
     and vendors inactive for a specific time.
     1.11.5.3. When files are purged, they remain off line, for an AFMC/FM-defined period,
     before deletion. Use the following as requirements for retention until AFMC/FM updates
     them:
 24                                                                 AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014

   1.12.1. The scope of the financial management workload in depot maintenance is very large
   and complex requiring judgment be applied on what work to emphasize and how much time
   to devote. Use materiality as one criterion in making that judgment as well as determining
   the magnitude of an omission or misstatement of an item in a financial report of a reportable
   entity.
   1.12.2. An item is material if its omission or misstatement makes it probable that the
   judgment of a reasonable person relying on the information would have been changed or
   influenced by the inclusion or correction of the item.
   1.12.3. Materiality must be calculated against a materiality base. The materiality base must
   be net of intra-governmental balances on the books of the reportable entity.
       1.12.3.1. If the misstatement is in an asset or liability account, the materiality base would
       be total assets or liabilities in the accounting records at the time materiality is being
       determined.
       1.12.3.2. If the misstatement is in an expense or revenue account, the materiality base
       would be total expenses or revenues during the period applicable to the materiality
       determination.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     25


  1.12.4. An omission or misstatement is considered material if it is one percent or more of its
  materiality base. Each ALC should calculate materiality separately based on the records
  command-wide.

                                          Chapter 2

                                    MANAGE FUNDING

2.1. Introduction
   2.1.1. Financial resources are generated by the acceptance of customer orders to replenish
   the depot maintenance working capital fund and to permit continuing operations. Customer
   orders (funded requests for goods or services) provide the budgetary resources necessary to
   finance operations. Customer orders create a quasi-contractual relationship between a
   Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) activity and its customer, since acceptance of a
   customer order requires that the performing entity agrees in writing to perform the work for
   the customer entity. Customers of depot maintenance may be (1) any Department of Defense
   (DoD) command, organization, office, or other element; (2) non-DoD federal government
   agencies; (3) state and local governments; (4) foreign governments (including Foreign
   Military Sales (FMS)), and (5) private parties and concerns, as authorized by law. Cash
   advances may also be requested from federal government activities when directed, or
   approved, by the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller. Cash advances from private
   parties and concerns are required. Obligations must be supported by budgetary resources that
   are immediately available for outlay even though the outlay may not occur until a future date.
   2.1.2. Within DMAPS, FIT (Funding Initiation Tool System) provides funds control data
   such as the Funding Document, the (SPON) Sponsor Order Number and the (CON)
   Customer Order Number for CSAG-M (Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group
   Maintenance) to DIFMS (Defense Industrial Financial Management System).
      2.1.2.1. Automated Project Order Form System (APO-J025A) creates the SPON and FIT
      creates the CON. Job Order Production Master System (JOPMS-Q302/G004L) passes
      the customer’s Line of Accounting (LOA) to FIT. FIT then creates the funding stream in
      its entirety and passes the Funding Document, SPON, and CON to DIFMS for validation
      and approval.
      2.1.2.2. If DIFMS rejects any portion of the funding stream, FIT produces error reports
      for correction by Center personnel in APO-J025A, Q302/G004L, and DIFMS. FIT
      holds the APO-J025A portion of the transaction until the user makes necessary correction
      . After correction, the user re-processes the data in FIT for passing to DIFMS.
      2.1.2.3. Once DIFMS has funding in place, a Job Order Number (JON) can be opened.
      No JON can be opened until DIFMS accepts the Funding Document, SPON, and CON
      corresponding to the JON.
   2.1.3. There is an automated feed from Q302/G004L to DIFMS to support the opening and
   closing of direct JONs. (Please refer to Section 2.8.) DIFMS cannot open a direct JON until
   the customer funding is in place.
      2.1.3.1. Funding Chain, in Figure 2.1., shows the relationships of the Funding Document,
      SPON, CON, and JON in DIFMS.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                   27

      2.1.3.2. FIT creates the funding document corresponding to the LOA (Line of
      Accounting) in Q302/G004L. This LOA matches the Funds Classification Reference
      Number (FCRN).
      2.1.3.3. The SPON is created from the APO-J025A Document Reference Number. It is
      up to a 15-character alphanumeric field and is formatted according to the Standard
      Document Number (SDN) format. The SDN is a 14-character document number
      comprised of a Responsible Identification Code, Calendar Year (CY), Julian Date, SDN
      Type, SDN Subtype and two-character Sequence Number. For additional SDN and
      SPON by Paths, see paragraph 2.3.3 herein. After SPON creation, APO-J025A passes
      the SPON to FIT.

          2.1.3.3.1. The first part of the SDN consists of one of the following three types of
          Responsible Identification Codes.
             2.1.3.3.1.1. Business Partner Number (BPN) is a six-digit alphanumeric DoD
             code that identifies a unit, activity, or organization for intra-governmental
             financial identification purposes only.
28                                                           AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


            2.1.3.3.1.2. A DoD Activity Address Code (DODAAC) is a six-digit
            alphanumeric code used for providing a uniform method for controlling DoD
            assets and for recording transactions that reflect receipts and disposition of
            property transferred to an activity.
         2.1.3.3.1.3. A Military Assistance Program Address Code (MAPAC) is a six-position
         alphanumeric code used to identify the ship-to and mark-for addresses of FMS and
         Grant Aid shipments and documentation. Air Force MAPACs begin with “D”. The
         MAPACs are maintained by the Defense Automatic Addressing System Center
         (DAASC).
     2.1.3.4. If the workload is FMS or private party, the SPON will be the reference number
     typed into APO-J025A’s Document Reference Number from the funding source.
     2.1.3.5. FIT creates the CON by taking the Program Control Number (PCN) in APO-
     J025A and adding a 4-digit serial number (i.e. AJEKLY0001). The CON is subordinate
     to the Funding Document and SPON, and is the parent of one or more JONs.
     2.1.3.6. The direct JON originates in Q302/G004L. This JON is matched by FIT to the
     correct Funding Document/SPON/CON combination and interfaced to DIFMS. A Direct
     JON is the AF production JON + ‘000’ (i.e. A1234U11A000)
     2.1.3.7. For the funding chain of SPON, CON, and JON, a one-position numeric element
     is used to reflect the status in DIFMS. The major status codes used are: 1 – Open, 2 –
     Reopened, and 3 – Closed. At the JON level, status code 6 – Cancelled or Terminated
     without Costs and status code 7 – Cancelled or Terminated with Costs are used.
  2.1.4. The funding chain is then filtered through FIT to DIFMS via a scheduled near-real
  time file. Only Capital Investment Program (CIP) funding is entered directly into DIFMS.
     2.1.4.1. After validation of funding through FIT, the JON is opened in DIFMS. Once the
     JON is open in DIFMS, labor may be transacted in TAA (Time and Attendance) and
     material may be procured via ABOM (Automated Bill of Material) and/or NIMMS
     (NAVAIR Industrial Material Management System. JONs may be restricted in DIFMS
     after receiving approval from the budget office or other controlling authority.
     Restrictions limiting types of Labor or Material charges are done with the use of
     restriction codes. Business operating costs can be incurred through direct entry in
     DIFMS.
  2.1.5. For orders accepted from Private Parties, an advance is received, which is collected
  into CSAG. A liability record is established in DIFMS to control the Advance amount.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                      29


Figure 2.2. Funding and Advance Chain for Private Parties




      2.1.5.1. The Advance collected must be identified to the CONs applicable to the
      workload being performed and be in whole dollars only. Customer checks received with
      pennies will be returned. Note: this requirement is due to APO-J025A’s inability to
      process pennies.
          2.1.5.1.1. The association of the Advance to the CON requires that the total funding
          document for the private party be allocated to the CON level. Note: The total CON
          amount does not have to be allocated to the JON level.
          2.1.5.1.2. The CON number may be notated on the DD Form 1131, Cash Collection
          Voucher.
          2.1.5.1.3. The Advance amount on the CON record is reduced by the billed amounts.
   2.1.5.2. If the CON has not been established, when the advance collection is made, this
   amount appears on the 7310-322 report, "Weekly Unallocated Details". The unallocated
   cash error is corrected through normal procedures as outlined in Chapter 6, 6.6 Unallocated
   Cash Processing.
      2.1.5.3. If funding is transferred between CONs, prepare a zero batch in the Cash
      Module to move the advance to the appropriate CON.
      2.1.5.4. If at the end of the work there is funding remaining, a request to DFAS to
      process a refund to the customer is made.
   2.1.6. At the end of each fiscal year, DIFMS goes through a process to move the entire
   current year customer funding to a category called prior year funding. This process is done
   with FIT and DIFMS working together. This means that any current year funding in either
   DIFMS or FIT represents only the current fiscal year dollars. It does not mean that prior year
   dollars are expired or no longer valid. All prior year funding, no matter how old it is, is
   categorized as prior year. The End of Year (EOY) rollover of DIFMS must happen at
   exactly the same time as the FIT EOY roll over or current and prior year balances are
   misstated.

2.2. Project Orders (PO).
   2.2.1. A Project Order (41 USC 23) is the most common basis that depot maintenance has to
   obtain funding. DoD customers use the PO, other government activities use the Economy
   Act, and other customers use a customer order supported by the law that authorizes the order
   to be placed. Depot maintenance customers provide an approved funding document
   specifying the negotiated work to be accomplished and the funding reserved to pay for that
   work. Examples of funding documents include: AFMC181, Project Order or DD Form 448,
   Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR). Based upon the approved funding
   document and acceptance, depot maintenance inputs information into APO-J025A to
   automate the coordination of one or more AFMC181. This documentation provides financial
   integrity of the funds insuring that requested work is not performed without funding in place.
      2.2.1.1. Information from APO-J025A is interfaced to DIFMS through FIT. This
      documentation serves as the authority for depot maintenance to induct work and to
      charge the customer the appropriate sales price or rate per hour. The term ‘customer’
      throughout section 2.2 refers to the activity that issues the PO. Depot maintenance must
      have a fully funded customer project order prior to inducting any workload. Air
      Logistics Center (ALC) procedures must be established to enforce this policy to avoid
      inducting any workload before the customer has provided the funded PO. POs are not
      issued to depot maintenance for any of the following:
          2.2.1.1.1. Major new construction of real property (Specific detail is contained in
          DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 3, Chapter 17, Accounting for Military Construction
          Projects)
          2.2.1.1.2. Education, subsistence, printing, laundry, welfare, transportation, travel, or
          communications when any of these is the primary purpose of the request
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     31


         2.2.1.1.3. Any purpose where a clear buyer-seller relationship does not exist between
         the customer and depot maintenance
         2.2.1.1.4. For work done within an ALC Maintenance Wing and funded by that ALC
         2.2.1.1.5. For any purpose that directives/instructions would not permit under
         commercial contracts
  2.2.2. There are conditions governing issuance, performance, and management of funding
  documents. Funding documents are similar to contracts placed with commercial enterprises
  and, like such contracts, must be specific, definite, and certain as to the workload ordered.
  When accepted by depot maintenance, customer funds on the funding documents are
  obligated. The customer’s obligation is established at the Project Order level and is based on
  the funded customer requirements.
     2.2.2.1. Funding documents are issued by the customer and accepted by depot
     maintenance. As depot maintenance incurs costs, billings are submitted to the customer
     who will reimburse depot maintenance. The depot maintenance activity is responsible
     for promptly advising the customer concerning changes in the ordered work, such as
     delivery schedules, planned cost, or work content/quantities.
     2.2.2.2. Customer funds placed on POs must serve a bona fide need existing in the fiscal
     quarter for which issued. The work to be performed under POs is expected to commence
     during the Fiscal Year (FY) quarter stated in the PO Number (PON).
         2.2.2.2.1. For PDM (Programmed Depot Maintenance) aircraft only, the opening of a
         Job Order Number (JON) for material ordering may occur 30 days prior to the aircraft
         arrival within the same Fiscal Year (FY), as long as a valid Project Order (PO) is in
         place. This is authorized in HQ AFMC/FMR memo dated 16 March 2011.
     2.2.2.3. Customer order funding must cover the sum of all work orders (JONs) under
     each CON. If, upon receipt of a funding document, the appropriate depot maintenance
     activity determines the amount of funds stated on the order is either ‘in excess’ or
     ‘insufficient’ of that required, immediate follow-up action is taken with the customer. If
     there is no response from the customer in a timely manner, the customer is notified in
     writing as to the estimated excess or deficit amount. The practice of establishing
     underfunded CONS will be limited to the first quarter.
     2.2.2.4. All POs must be prepared by the customer, certified by the appropriate office,
     and be in the applicable depot maintenance component not later than 3 workdays and not
     sooner than 10 workdays prior to the beginning of the quarter covered by the order. If
     justifiable conditions preclude the customer from issuing a basic PO in three workdays to
     cover all negotiated workload, a Letter of Intent (LOI) must be used. This letter must
     identify the delinquent PON and Program Control Number (PCN), and specify an
     estimate of the total dollars and accounting classifications that are placed on the funded
     order. To ensure continuity of operations and system acceptance of the work orders,
     Letters of Intent may be established in the PO validation and FCRN master. See
     paragraph 2.7 addressing “Letters of Intent” or “Commander’s Operating Orders.”
         2.2.2.4.1. FOR PDM AIRCRAFT ONLY - All POs must be prepared by the
         customer, certified by the appropriate office, and be in the applicable depot
32                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


        maintenance component not later than 3 calendar days and not sooner than 30
        calendar days prior to the beginning of the quarter covered by the order.
     2.2.2.5. The final page of each PO must contain the following statement: “This order is
     placed according to the provisions of Title 41 United States Code (USC), Section 23,
     and DoD FMR 7000.14-R.” See FMR Volume 11A, Chapter 2.
     2.2.2.6. A JON is identified to the PO period using the most recent date of the JON
     opened or inducted. G004L assigns the PON to the JON when the induction is reported.
     During the first quarter of the FY (October through December), Management of Items
     Subject to Repair (MISTR) inductions may be made and charged to the prior fourth
     quarter PO when inductions are made to replace non-serviceable turn-in after the close of
     the FY. In no case are inductions to exceed the Customer Order Quantity (COQ)
     established as of 30 September in any FY.
     2.2.2.7. POs include appropriations that are subject to closure or cancellation. This
     means that the appropriation is no longer available for adjustments or payments. Vigilant
     attention must be exercised by depot maintenance activity to ensure that all workload
     obligations incurred against the appropriation are completed and billed to the customer
     prior to the closure date for the appropriation.
     2.2.2.8. Each ALC establishes local internal controls to ensure that customer funding
     received is adequate to cover the negotiated workload, is properly certified when a PO is
     issued to depot maintenance, and that no work is inducted before the depot receives the
     funded PO.      These operating procedures are established using local operating
     instructions.
     2.2.2.9. Changes to scope of work:
        2.2.2.9.1. If the customer requests work to be performed, and this work is in addition
        to the work originally negotiated, then additional funding must be obtained by the
        ALC from the customer before the work is performed.
        2.2.2.9.2. If during the repair process, additional required work is discovered but was
        not negotiated. The ALC must obtain approval and funding from the customer before
        performing the additional work.
        2.2.2.9.3. If the scope of work is decreased at the request of the customer, the ALC
        must reduce customer funding on the PO for the amount of the reduced work less any
        costs to depot maintenance that are a result of the workload reduction. The funds
        should be returned to the customer even if the customer's appropriation has expired.
     2.2.2.10. POs, may contain special provisions and be subsequently modified, amended,
     or cancelled. Customers are responsible for cost charges due to their cancellation of
     previously negotiated workload or reduction in quantities. Funds should not be returned
     to the customer prior to these costs being collected.
        2.2.2.10.1. After acceptance of a PO, if the repair activity cannot perform the
        designated work or deliver the specified material, negotiate an amendment with the
        customer to portray what the repair activity can perform or deliver. Return the excess
        funds to the customer through the APO-J025A process.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                      33


         2.2.2.10.2. Customers must formally provide an intention/notification to cancel
         before depot maintenance issues formal cancellation instructions for active (open)
         aircraft, missile, or engine POs or any line item of workload identified. This must be
         accomplished at the earliest possible time, but no later than 30 days before the
         effective date of cancellation. This notice is required so depot maintenance can
         reschedule other firm workloads, and assess the financial impact of returning excess
         material to supply. If cancellation is required, complete the items in work and charge
         costs to the applicable JON.
         2.2.2.10.3. If the quantity of items is decreased, or if workload is canceled, the funds
         associated with the reduced quantities or canceled work less any cancellation charges
         must be returned to the customer even if the customer's appropriation has expired.
         Funds should not be returned to the customers until billing of canceled JONs has been
         completed. The Funding Initiator Reports (FIR) contains and displays the
         Q302/G004L JON Status Code (JSC) 3 the day after Job Order Status Tool (JOST)
         sends the JSC to DIFMS.
     2.2.2.11. As part of its responsibility to customers, depot maintenance ensures the proper
     management of all POs received to include closing and final billing, notifying the
     customer of any excess or deficient funding, and recommending the reallocation of funds
     among their POs. The PO status reports of the DIFMS, or formal correspondence, may
     be used for advising customers of funding excesses or deficits.
     2.2.2.12. Downward adjustments of previously recorded obligations are referred to as de-
     obligations. Customer funds must be de-obligated when no longer required for the
     purpose originally obligated such as cancelled work, reduced scope, and/or inability to
     perform the required work. Customers must be notified of the de-obligation when the
     billing is completed.
         2.2.2.12.1. The rules for de-obligation follow from the principles required for
         obligation. See AFI 65-601, Volume I, Budget Guidance and Procedures, DFAS-DE
         7000.4-R, Accounting for Obligations, and Department of Defense Financial
         Management Regulation (DoD 7000.14-R), Volume 3, Chapter 8, Standards for
         Recording and Reviewing Commitments and Obligations.
         2.2.2.12.2. Funds must be de-obligated when the need no longer exists for the
         obligated funds. Funds de-obligated within the period of obligation availability can
         be re-used by the customer.
         2.2.2.12.3. The funding stream between APO-J025A and DIFMS is processed on a
         two-hour cycle to attain more effective management control between POs and
         funding of dollar requirements for work. Acceptance of the funds in DIFMS is
         reflected in APO-J025A every two hours. The funds from the previous day are
         available for depot maintenance and customer activity to induct workload.
  2.2.3. Within the available financial authority, the customer may initiate amendments to POs
  which increase the scope (increase in scope require funds current at the time) or value of a
  workload requirement during the period for which the funds cited on the order are available
  for obligations.
 34                                                             AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


       2.2.3.1. Amendments for price increases are charged to the same LOA that was current
       at the time the initial order was prepared. Amendments for extending the scope of work
       (approved increases to work packages) are charged to the same LOA if the Document
       Number is the same as the initial order and the original funds are still active. If a new
       LOA is used, a new FCRN must also be established. Amendments that decrease funds
       may be made at any time.
       2.2.3.2. Amendments are processed through the same certifying office and depot
       maintenance activity channels used for processing basic orders.
       2.2.3.3. Amendments are made to POs at the PON, PCN, and FCRN level.
   2.2.4. The numbering of the Project Orders (PO) is of interest to both depot maintenance and
   the customer. The customer issues and amends each order based upon a predetermined
   sequence. PONs, contained in block 2 of AFMC181, are five numeric digits in length and
   are constructed as follows:

Table 2.2. Project Order Number (PON)
                             Project Order Number (PON)

   2.2.5. The Depot Maintenance rates used for pricing and billing of POs depend on the type
   of work involved (the last position of the PON). (See Table 2.3)
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     35

Note 1: Individual ALCs will use local procedure to determine when to use the manual project
forms when the Automated Project Order (APO/J025A) is unavailable. The current manual
AFMC181, Project Order, is located at the following website:
http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMC181.xfdl

Note 2: Once the APO/J025A system is available, all Project Orders (POs) created using
AFMC Form 181 will have to be re-accomplished in the system. It is important to adhere to the
same alphanumeric requirements and not to exceed the number of characters noted in each
block. When the PO is input into the system the date becomes permanent and cannot be
overridden. The PO initiator shall include in the comments the original date reflected on the
manual PO. As signatures are re-accomplished, coordinators should include in the comments
the date and name of the person originating the signed manual PO, if different.

Note 3: Only the affected PCNs need to be reflected on amended POs issued during the quarter.
These PCNs indicate the new order of input quantity, DPSH, and dollars at the time of
amendment. If any one of these items has changed, then blocks 10, 12, and 14 are completed.
An example of this would be a need to change the amount of dollars associated with a PCN for a
MISTR order. In this case, the DPSH may not have required a change. Blocks 10, 12, and 14
must always be completed to reflect the new (total) position. 'Plus' or 'minus' variances may also
be indicated, within parentheses, in these columns.

Note 4: Indicate on a memo basis, the amount of over and above funds included in each PCN
for serialized workload.

   2.2.11. Project Order (PO) Balancing Procedures
       2.2.11.1. The initial balancing takes place at the end of the fiscal quarter and when the
       end-of-month position (December, March, June, and September) has been obtained in
       DIFMS. The process for each type of order is as follows:
           2.2.11.1.1. Types 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 POs. The appropriate funding activity reviews
           the DIFMS status reports or contacts the applicable depot maintenance activity for an
           estimate of what is required to complete each order.
           2.2.11.1.2. Type 4 POs. The appropriate funding activity reviews the induction
           dollar value from the DIFMS status reports.
       2.2.11.2. The final balancing of the Project Order is made when all JONs are closed and
       the billing has occurred. The DIFMS CON status code “3” notification that the PO is in a
       closure status is passed to APO-J025A.
       2.2.11.3. DIFMS is designed to portray a financial management status on every PO
       accepted by depot maintenance. Information is available to DFAS, the ALC office
       accepting the PO, and the funding activity office in the ALC initiating the PO. The
       appropriate offices assure compatibility between the estimated funding requirement and
       the funded programs. The status documents are used to monitor and track the financial
       progress of each order, and serve as the financial management communication tool
       among these activities. The ALC product division and the funding activity closely
       monitor funding status to assure the following.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                    41


       2.2.11.4. The Project Order Acceptor must assure the recorded input quantity does not
       exceed the ordered PCN quantity available and sufficient dollars are available to
       complete all input quantities. Prior to a quantity change, it must be verified that
       appropriate funding has been received and confirmed. If it appears a PO/PCN/FCRN is
       overrun, the appropriate depot maintenance activity requests a PO amendment for
       additional funds with an explanation of the reason for the increase.
       2.2.11.5. The Project Order Acceptor must assure the identified ordered Customer Order
       Quantity (COQ) or Job Order Quantity (JOQ)/FCRN dollar values do not exceed the
       PO/FCRN dollars. If the COQ/JOQ/FCRN dollars are greater than the PO/FCRN dollars,
       the funding activity amends the PO increasing the PCN/FCRN sufficiently to cover the
       deficit, or reduces requirements to available dollars.

Note 1: The use of serial number control in depot maintenance data systems is mandatory. An
hourly sales rate is entered into the Q302/G004L system by the number by the appropriate depot
maintenance activity.

Note 2: If the workload being ordered is controlled by Wholesale and Retail Receiving and
Shipping (WARRS-D035K) and has a short flow time (30 days or less), the work is placed on a
Type 6 PO in RGC D (if missile) or H (if OMEI). These have a Unit of Measure (UOM) of Each
(EA) and an end item sales price established by the appropriate depot maintenance activity. All
other items of workloads are serial number controlled, have a UOM of Hour (HR), and use the
AFMC approved hourly sales rate.
2.3. Funding Establishment
   2.3.1. In the DMAPS funding process, all customer funding in DIFMS must originate in
   APO-J025A and JONs normally originate in Q302/G004L. Exceptions and Work Authority
   (WA) are addressed later in the chapter. Funding for CIP is handled directly in DIFMS.
   DIFMS is the system of record for funding control.
       2.3.1.1. No work may be conducted without a funded JON. DMAPS only allows work
       to be started when proper funding is recorded in DIFMS.
       2.3.1.2. If any part of the funding stream is rejected, the rejects may need to be corrected
       in the originating system (APO-J025A, Q302/G004L, or FIT) for reprocessing.
       Coordination may be needed between systems in the funding stream flow. If the funding
       has not been established in the originating system then no work can be performed until
       funding has been established. The errors will need to be corrected before work is
       scheduled to start.
   2.3.2. When the customer funding is accepted in APO-J025A, it becomes an obligation to
   the customer and must be recorded in the customer’s accounting system.
   2.3.3. APO-J025A feeds a Document Reference Number to FIT, which becomes the
   Funding Document or SPON in DIFMS. APO creates the SPON from the APO Document
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                         43


  Cross-Reference field and passes to FIT. APO will use the Standard Document Number
  (SDN) format to create the SPON, except for EXPRESS funding uses the SRAN. All other
  funding will use the Customer Business Partner Number (BPN) to designate customer. Once
  DIFMS has accepted the funding stream, information is returned through FIT to APO-J025A
  to confirm funding has been established.
     2.3.3.1. Path 1- Source of Repair is located at the same ALC with Source of Supply
     (collocated), who is funding the workload. The ALC is responsible for certifying the
     funds in APO-J025A. DFAS will obligate the funds in GAFS-BQ. APO sets the SPON
     to Business Partner Number (BPN) + Calendar Year + Julian Date + Project Order
     Designator Code (J) + Obligation Subtype Code (J) + SDN Sequence Number (i.e.
     FD20206215JJ99).
     2.3.3.2. Path 2- Source of Repair is located at ALC other than the ALC with the Source
     of Supply (not collocated), who is funding the workload. The ALC is responsible for
     certifying the funds in APO-J025A. DFAS will obligate the funds in GAFS-BQ. APO
     sets the SPON to BPN + Calendar Year + Julian Date + Project Order Designator Code
     (J) + Obligation Subtype Code (J) + SDN Sequence Number (i.e. F3YCAB6215JJ99).
     2.3.3.3. Path 3- Direct cite document used to pay for workload. Source of Repair is
     collocated. The customer will commit and obligate the funds. The funds initiator enters
     the original funding document number in APO. (Fund code WA) APO set the SPON to
     Stock Record Account Number (SRAN) or the BPN + Calendar Year + Julian Date +
     Project Order Designator Code (J) + Obligation Subtype Code (J) + SDN Sequence
     Number (i.e. FD20206215JJ99).
     2.3.3.4. Path 4- Direct cite document used to pay for workload. Source of Repair is not
     collocated. The customer will commit and obligate the funds. The funds initiator enters
     the original funding document number in APO. (Fund code WA) APO set the SPON to
     Stock Record Account Number (SRAN) or the BPN + Calendar Year + Julian Date +
     Project Order Designator Code (J) + Obligation Subtype Code (J) + SDN Sequence
     Number (i.e. FD20206215JJ99).
  2.3.4. With the implementation of Centralized Asset Management (CAM), the Supply
  Division now uses Work Authority (WA) to ‘fund’ all POs that it sends to the CSAG-M
  (Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group - Maintenance Division). WA does not represent
  true funding; rather, it is merely a means of setting the ceiling and tracking the dollar value of
  the amount of work the Supply Division is authorized to order from CSAG in a given fiscal
  year. This includes all repair workload, including exchangeables and local manufacturing,
  which was previously part of the Buy Program. Reimbursement/Customer Code “U” is used
  for WA. The WA ceiling is maintained directly in APO-J025A. Unused ceiling amounts
  from prior years do not roll over to the new fiscal year. Ceiling amounts are locked at the
  fiscal year cut-off and are only changeable with the approval of an AFMC/WA Auditor.
     2.3.4.1. The Execution and Prioritization of Repair Support System (EXPRESS –
     D087X) prioritizes Supply Division project order needs based on available WA. APO-
     J025A sends the available WA balance daily to EXPRESS. EXPRESS sends a file of
     prioritized requirements to APO-J025A on a daily basis, based on the available amount.
 44                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


          2.3.4.1.1. The Supply Division approver reviews the PO for any errors and approves.
          Following the approver stage, the next required step is acceptance.
          2.3.4.1.2. FIT and DIFMS recognize for Work Authority, the first position of the
          PCN on the PO is ‘U’ and the Order Type Code (OTC) is set to ‘G’. OTC ‘G’
          becomes the unique data element for distinguishing the Supply Division non-billable
          workload throughout the life of the PO.
          2.3.4.1.3. Throughout the DIFMS program logic, CSAG project orders for CSAG
          Supply customers are referred to as ‘non-reimbursable’ customer orders. This term
          reflects the fact that CSAG will receive neither cash nor record revenue for this
          workload. Accordingly, CSAG does still record the value of the customer order in
          statistical General Ledger Accounts (GLAs). Once the customer order passes DIFMS
          validation, CSAG is able to create new JONs against the order. CAM billing
          suppression did not invoke changes to the process of opening, updating, or closing
          JONs. JONs are still created in Q302/G004L, and the Permanent JON Master (PJM)
          and Temporary JON Master (TJM) tables are sent to FIT and DIFMS as usual. Once
          JONs are loaded in DIFMS, CSAG can begin recording cost on the JON. As work is
          completed and cost is incurred, it is recorded in the same cost fields on the JON
          record as it was prior to CAM billing suppression. During the regular billing cycles,
          DIFMS does not create a bill for customer orders with OTC ‘G’.
2.4. FCRN and LOA
   2.4.1. A 4-digit alphanumeric code is assigned for input to the FCRN validation table in
   Q302/G004L, which corresponds to the customers’ accounting classification or Line of
   Accounting (LOA). Parameters for the establishment of FCRNs must be consistent with
   local ALC procedures.
   2.4.2. FIT receives the customer LOA placed on the AFMC181 via the Q302/G004L. It is
   input to the Q302/G004L Validation Stack. FIT uses the LOA from the validation stack as
   the line to place on the funding document. It is imperative this line of accounting be correct.
   2.4.3. If the LOA is modified in Q302/G004L, the modification is passed to FIT and APO-
   J025A. This is not a problem so long as no funding documents have been processed through
   APO-J025A. If a funding document with an erroneous LOA has already been processed
   through APO-J025A, corrections will need to be coordinated between the ALC APO-J025A
   System Administrators and the appropriate ALC Cost Accounting personnel. Additional
   information regarding the DIFMS process can be obtained through the Technical Service
   Organization’s website: https://t6800.csd.disa.mil/DifmsPortal/index.php. Please click on
   the appropriate tab and then and then on the current production release.
2.5. Funding Issues to Watch
   2.5.1. There is an edit in APO-J025A to provide for the validation of the Reimbursement
   (Customer) Code (first letter of the PCN) which prevents more than one customer code per
   FCRN/PON combination. An FCRN can have only one Reimbursement (Customer) Code in
   the same quarter, but there can be many PCNs to an FCRN. As an example, if FCRN ‘391V’
   is set up with customer code ‘U’, then any PCN with a different customer code is stopped in
   APO-J025A within that same quarter.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                        45


   2.5.2. Once a document is processed through APO-J025A and a SPON is created, the user
   cannot modify the document reference number on the original PON/PCN/FCRN
   combination. Any change necessary requires coordination between the ALC APO-J025A
   System Administrators and the appropriate ALC Cost Accounting personnel. Additional
   information regarding the DIFMS process can be obtained through the Technical Service
   Organization’s website: https://t6800.csd.disa.mil/DifmsPortal/index.php. Please click on
   the appropriate tab and then and then on the current production release.
      2.5.2.1. The Funds Initiator needs to check the budget authority balance in H069/BQ
      prior to initiating an AFMC181.
      2.5.2.2. APO-J025A prevents the Funds Initiator from inputting an amendment that
      reduces the Working Authority (WA) funds in excess of funds available. Working
      Authority only applies to Reimbursement Code “U”, OTC “G”.
2.6. Cost Sharing (Multi-funded) Process
   2.6.1. Cost Sharing (Multi-funded) Process For Work Excluding Q303/G004L Work Control
   Documents (WCD’s) JONs, also known as “Multi-Funded” JONs, are used when the total
   costs of a project are shared among various customers. Total project costs are shared using
   pre-determined percentages set by the Program Manager. These percentages are calculated
   based upon the countries that chose to participate in the program and the respective number
   of the participant’s aircraft receiving the upgrade. An example of a situation where cost
   sharing is appropriate would be F-16 software upgrades. Costs for upgrades to F-16 software
   are shared among the U.S. Air Force and various Foreign Military customers that operate the
   weapon system.
   2.6.2. The Cost Share process requires establishment of a collection JON (‘B’ JON) and
   multiple benefiting JONs. The benefiting JONs are direct JONs, funded via APO-J025A,
   created in Q302/G004L, and established in DIFMS via the daily JON interface file. The
   collection JON and funding stream are established directly in DIFMS.
   2.6.3. The Cost Share collection funding chain is established directly in DIFMS using the
   DIFMS Screens MS154P “Funding Document Update”, MS108P “Non-Navy Sponsor
   Record Update”, and MS153P “Customer Identification Update”. This funding chain is only
   used for cost share collection JONs and is not billed. Additionally, only one collection
   funding chain is necessary to provide parent records for all cost shared collection JONs. The
   Order Type Code, Type Customer Code, and other attributes of the collection funding chain
   are unimportant, as all actual costs collected are transferred to the benefiting funding chains.
   2.6.4. The Cost Share collection JON is established in DIFMS using the DIFMS Screen
   MS152P “Direct Job Order Update”. All costs incurred on the particular project shall be
   collected against a single collection JON. The first position of the collection JON must start
   with the alpha character ‘B’ to meet DMAPS Data Store (DDS) System validation
   requirements. Additionally, the last three positions of the JON (positions 10-12) must be
   ‘000’ in order to meet TAA validation requirements.
      2.6.4.1. Cost share collection JONs are established in DIFMS directly. It is not possible
      to produce work control documents and use various production systems: Facilities and
      Equipment Management System (FEM-D130), Programmed Depot Maintenance
 46                                                             AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      Scheduling System (PDMSS-G097), and Inventory Tracking System (ITS-G337) with
      this JON.
   2.6.5. If the benefiting JONs are temporary AFMC206 JON(s), the production Planner
   (PO/PTC), Scheduler (PSSD) or Work-loader (WTC) will open these temporary AFMC206
   JONs only when the cost transfers of the B prefix collection JON are ready to be done. The
   temporary AFMC206 JONs will be planned in Q302/G004L so that the End Item Sales Price
   (EISP) or the Extended End Item Sales Price (EEISP) will be as close to the actual costs as
   possible but at no loss to the center. The temporary AFMC206 JONs will then be
   immediately closed in G004L, ensuring that the closure does not occur after the fiscal year
   end in which the JONs was (were) opened. APO-J025A funding should match the total
   requirements at the cost level as shown by the JONs and not include monies that could not be
   used for current year requirements.
   2.6.6. No costs are collected directly on benefiting JONs. All benefiting JON costs are
   incurred as cost transfers from collection JONs.
   2.6.7. Cost transfer percentages and/or actual cost amounts are provided to cost accounting
   by the Program manager after completion of the project. All costs are then transferred from
   the collection JON to multiple benefiting JONs.
   2.6.8. The collection JON may be cancelled (DIFMS Status ‘6’) after all costs have been
   transferred. The benefiting JONs may also be closed (and completions taken) after all costs
   have been transferred.
   2.6.9. Additional Cost Share procedural notes: Material ordered against the collection JON
   may be ordered using the ‘Not on Bill of Material (BOM)’ process.
2.7. Work Performed in Advance of a Reimbursable Order
   2.7.1. Per DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 11B, Chapter 11, work in advance of a reimbursable
   order is for “emergency” or “urgent” circumstances. The terms “emergency” or “urgent”
   does not include cases where customer-driven workload needs to be performed in advance of
   funding to meet flow days and effectively use available capacity. Emergency or urgent is
   driven by customer requirements. While there may be some services furnished by a DWCF
   activity prior to receiving a funded order, this should be a rare occurrence. Whenever this
   occurs, these services are performed based on anticipated orders or for programs included in
   approved budget requests. This type of work is for existing customers that have annual
   recurring requirements. Work for customers may begin in advance of receipt and acceptance
   of a formal order under these circumstances.
      2.7.1.1. Customers may issue “Subject to Availability” orders when operating under a
      Continuing Resolution. Orders issued under Continuing Resolution Authority (CRA)
      shall identify the portion of the order that is covered by current Obligation Authority
      (OA). If OA is not available, work should be stopped until OA becomes available.
      2.7.1.2. When necessary to incur limited costs in advance of the receipt of a regular order
      for an authorized program for which customer funds are available, such work or services
      may be undertaken based on a “Letter of Intent (LOI).” Per the DoD 7000.14-R, Letters
      of Intent which are an obligation of the ordering activity (i.e., customer) in a stated
      amount of funding sufficient to cover the advance costs that may be incurred. LOIs are
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     47


      obligating instruments that are contractual in nature, and the LOIs must be funded upon
      issuance. LOI should have a ‘subject to availability of funds’ clause. LOIs expire within
      30 days from the date of issuance. Upon expiration, no additional costs may be incurred
      since the LOIs should be replaced by receipt of a regular customer order. LOIs may be
      extended if circumstances justify the extension.
      2.7.1.3. When it is necessary to begin work prior to the receipt of an order, a
      Commanding Officer’s Order (COO) or similar order may be issued by the Commander
      of the Center or an authorized representative (appointed by a Letter of Designation). The
      Center must have written assurance from the customer that a reimbursable order shall be
      issued within 15 days of performing the work on the JON. The use of such orders should
      be limited to situations in which there are bona fide emergencies arising from unforeseen
      urgent requirements, e.g., loss or damage caused by a disaster, an act of God, or events
      caused by unforeseen security situations. A Commanding Officer’s Order must not be
      used as a normal procedure to circumvent administrative lead-times that should be
      considered in advance planning. A Commanding Officer’s Order shall expire within 30
      days from the date of issuance. It must be replaced with a funded order before billing can
      occur and work can continue. Before the funding process can be completed in APO-
      J025A, a formal letter is required from the Commanding Officer or designated
      representative so the document can be certified in APO-J025A.
   2.7.2. DMAPS provides the capability to handle work performed in advance of a
   reimbursable order, through the COO process. The Q302/G004L Validation Stack contains
   two FCRNs ('0000', ‘0001’) that do not contain a legitimate customer's Line of Accounting.
   The LOA on the FCRN 0000/0001 states that the requirement is for a COO. These FCRNs
   (0000/0001) are to be utilized ONLY by the CSAG to induct workload for Commanding
   Officer’s Orders when no legitimate funding exists. Commanding Officer’s funding must be
   established in APO-J025A. The user establishes the JON in Q302/G004L and work can
   commence.      After the workload is inducted and the legitimate funding stream
   (PON/PCN/FCRN) is established in APO-J025A, the user transfers the JON to the correct
   funding stream by changing the FCRN in Q302/G004L. This change is interfaced to FIT and
   to DIFMS. DIFMS transfers the JON to the correct Funding Document/SPON/CON. The
   user then can go into APO-J025A and deobligate the temporary PON/PCN/FCRN.
2.8. JON Type
   2.8.1. The first character of the JON will allow the user to determine what type of JON is
   being used and tell if it is collecting direct or indirect cost.
 48                                                               AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014

   2.8.2. For a Direct JON to be established, the Funding Document/SPON/CON relationship
   must be established in DIFMS. After establishment, work can begin.
   2.8.3. If DIFMS rejects the Direct JON, the JON appears as an error in JOST. The error will
   also appear on the DIFMS 7310-142 “DIFMS/SOS Errors” report. The user must make
   corrections and send the Direct JON for processing in JOST.
   2.8.4. The purpose of DIFMS Indirect JONs is to collect overhead or indirect expenses.
   Overhead is applied to direct JONs with the use of Overhead Application Rates (OARs). The
   accumulation of indirect expenses serves a similar purpose as United States Standard General
   Ledger (USSGL) accounts currently do, for management use and budget history. Expenses
   gathered in the indirect JONs are passed to DDS and subsequently to CPPM.
   2.8.5. AFMC adopted an indirect JON structure to provide consistency across all ALCs for
   capturing indirect costs. Sites are required to use the official Indirect JONs provided by
   Headquarters Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) Financial Management Directorate
   (AFMC/FM) and no variations from this list are approved. The indirect JON structure
   consists of 12 positions. For indirect labor JON’s, HQ-AFMC controls positions 1-7,
   positions 8-12 are to be used at the ALC. For indirect material and other cost JON’s, HQ-
   AFMC controls positions 1-9, ALC controls positions 10-12.

   2.8.5.1. Each ALC must designate an office to control, establish and maintain Indirect Job
   Order numbers for all indirect costs in a Resource Control Center (RCC), production
   overhead cost centers, and general and administrative cost centers.
   2.8.6. Each ALC must assure that RCCs to the ‘Cost Center Shop’ format are entered
   correctly. The Cost Center is also the shop in DIFMS, and is referred to the RCC outside of
   DIFMS (e.g., MBAAB). Shop Maintenance is an important function in JOCO. The DIFMS
   Screen MS158P “Authorized Shops Update”, allows the user to input or change the
   Authorized Shops for Direct or Indirect Job Order Numbers (JONs). Setting an authorized
   shop or range of shops effectively restricts charges from unauthorized shops. All valid shops
   must be tied to a cost center record. The user may not delete a cost center that is tied to a
   valid shop.

   2.8.7. Maintain documentation for the indirect JONs by using the spreadsheet to track
   descriptions and establishment/deletion dates. This is very important documentation since
   indirect JONs documentation is not in DIFMS.
   2.8.8. The Cost Production and Budget Module (CPBM-H033) system is mapped to the
   AFMC controlled positions of the indirect JONs and can only be changed with AFMC
   coordination. If an ALC chooses to create Indirect JONs other than the AFMC approved
   Indirect JONs, the costs and hours associated with those local use JONs are not captured in
   H033. This would negatively affect the overhead application rates, as well as, the
   distribution of costs to the RCCs via the Cost Transfer Module (CTM) of H033.
2.9. DIFMS Direct and Indirect JON Restriction Codes
   2.9.1. The restriction code is a three-position numeric element on both the Direct and
   Indirect JON records in DIFMS. The restriction code is used to define the types of valid
   costs that may be charged to the JON. Each position defines the level of restriction as
   follows:
   2.9.2. Position 3 defines valid contractual and business operations cost (i.e., ‘1’ = open to
   contractual and business operations cost, ‘2’ = contractual cost only, ‘3’ = business
   operations (other) cost only, ‘9’ = blocked to contractual and business operations (other)
   cost).
   2.9.3. Both direct and indirect JON restriction codes default to a value of ‘111’ when the
   JON is established in DIFMS.
   2.9.4. Direct JON Restriction Codes may be modified in JOST (Job Order Status Tool),
   using the “Modify Restriction Codes” selection. Changes to restriction codes should be
   made prior to Q302/G004L JON closure. Once the JOST update is made and validated, the
   restriction code update is passed to DIFMS in the daily JON interface file.
   2.9.5. Indirect JON Restriction Codes may be modified by using the DIFMS Update Screen
   MS151P “Indirect Job Order Update”.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                       51

   2.9.6. A Shop Indicator value of ‘1’ indicates that JON is open to all RCCs. A value of ‘2’
   indicates the shop is restricted to only specific RCCs. If a value of ‘2’ is set, the user must
   enter the specific RCCs directly into DIFMS Update Screen MS158P “Authorized Shops
   Update”. For example, Production Overhead (POH) cannot be charged in a G&A Shop.
2.10. Cost Class IV Type Workload (‘S’ JONs)
   2.10.1. The nature of Cost Class ‘4’ (duty code ‘14’ or .14 time) workload is work
   performed by one organization (e.g. shop, cost center, or RCC) for another. This means that
   the cost once accumulated must be transferred from the “performing” organization to the
   “benefiting” (owning) organization. This transfer is handled automatically in DIFMS under
   the normal cost transfer process.
   2.10.2. The Maintenance and Control (recording of effort at the Task level) of S- JONs is in
   the D130-FEM system. Work orders are established therein and the individual mechanics
   record their time against individual tasks on the work orders. The user inputs to both D130-
   FEM and TAA.
   2.10.3. The user opens an ‘S’ prefix job in D130-FEM using the nine position JON. D130-
   FEM transmits data through the CONEN to TAA and DDS to allow the mechanic to record
   time against the JON. Once the Cost Class Type IV Workload (S-JON) reaches the CE, it is
   converted from the ‘S1234’ S-JON format to the TAA Indirect JON format
   (X511114S1234). For example, a work order is established in D130-FEM for S-JON S1234.
   The planned hours, performing RCC, and standard hours are sent to TAA and DDS via
 52                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


   CONEN in an overnight file. When CONEN reads the S-JON S1234, it automatically
   converts it to an X-JON X511114S1234 and forwards this along with the information
   mentioned above to TAA and DDS to allow collection of time and effort.
   2.10.4. Once the X-JON has been established in TAA, the mechanic is permitted to charge
   labor and order required material to this JON. All labor is transacted in TAA against the
   indirect X-JON. Labor is collected at the operation level transaction.
   2.10.5. TAA permits transacting when the indirect JON is valid. If TAA cannot get a valid
   JON, transactions cannot occur. Indirect JONs are first established in DIFMS.
   2.10.6. TAA collects time (actual hours) transactions for each operation and then sends the
   transactions to DIFMS where the related costs are distributed to the benefiting organizations.
   Once the operation is complete, TAA sends this data to DIFMS and DDS.
   2.10.7. D130-FEM feeds a nightly file to Q302/G004L via the CONEN wherein the daily
   and nightly files are combined.
   2.10.8. The X- JONs are established first in DIFMS, and any necessary financial structuring
   occur in DIFMS. In addition, X- JONs are considered Production Overhead.
   2.10.9. As labor and material costs are incurred against the indirect X-JON, they are being
   recorded in DIFMS as an indirect cost pool that needs to be absorbed by the direct JONs
   worked that month. It is preferable to transfer the costs from the performing RCC to the
   owning or benefiting RCC. To accomplish this requires the creation of a cost transfer table,
   which the Centers build and maintain on a monthly basis. It has been determined that since
   S-JON costs are minimal in comparison to total depot costs (less than 1%), any
   misapplication of costs is insignificant, since to capture these support costs would require
   extensive effort and cost. However, care should be taken in establishing and configuring the
   performing cost centers for this type of work. If the amount of S-JON work is a significant
   percentage of the performing cost center's workload, the prices and costs of the organization's
   direct workload may be noticeably overstated.
2.11. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Job Orders
   2.11.1. In the DIFMS System Information Record, Appropriation Code “E” (Other
   Unfunded Labor) is set at the standard rate per DoD guidance available on the DoD
   Comptroller web site (http://www.dod.mil/comptroller/rates/index.html), unless changed
   by AFMC/FMR.
   2.11.2. The Unfunded Civilian Retirement Rate percentage is changed each fiscal year
   through entry in the DIFMS Screen MS166P “Acceleration Rates Updates”. This is the only
   surcharge for FMS customers, which covers unfunded civilian retirement, postretirement
   health benefits, and postretirement life insurance. The ALCs set up jobs based on fixed price
   (i.e., DoD stabilized rates) plus the surcharge. AFMC/FM guidance may require additional
   items be billed to FMS customers, such as military labor in Combat Logistics Support
   Squadrons.
   2.11.3. Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) establishes the reimbursable custom
   commitment in Security Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS).
   2.11.4. ALC Funds Manager establishes the project order in APO-J025A using Path 1 or 2
   when the Line of Accounting (LOA) relates to the ALCs’ Operating Agency Code (OAC) /
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                       53


   Operating Budget Account Number (OBAN). APO Initiators can type over the document
   reference number in APO-J025A using the SAMIS document control number (DCN). For
   other OACs / OBANs, use Path 3 or 4 and use the customer’s funding document number
   (MIPR, AFMC185, etc.).
   2.11.5. In some instances (like for multi-funded software), the ALCs have multiple
   Document Control Numbers (DCN).
   2.11.6. The ALC ALO reviews the PO in APO-J025A on a daily basis, pulls Obligation
   Authority (OA) out of the Case Management Computer System (CMCS), commits and loads
   OA in the General Accounting and Finance System-Base Level (GAFS/BL), and certifies the
   PO in APO-J025A.
   2.11.7. The ALC funds acceptors accept the PO in APO-J025A.
   2.11.8. The DFAS Intergovernmental Branch (Obligation Section) or ALC obligates the PO
   daily in GAFS/BL based on APO-J025A, and then finalizes the PO in APO-J025A.
   2.11.9. FIT receives the PO in a feed from APO-J025A and the Line of Accounting from
   Q302/G004L. It feeds the information (i.e., SPON, LOA, and CON) to DIFMS. The FMS
   order is set up as Order Type Code (OTC) 1 for the fixed price bill calculation.
   2.11.10. The ALC Maintenance Group establishes the JON in Q302/G004L.                     The
   Conversion Engine feeds the JONs from Q302/G004L to DIFMS.
   2.11.11. Cost is collected against the JONs in DIFMS.
2.12. Direct JON Closure Process
   2.12.1. All funding documents remain in DIFMS and FIT until they are closed. The closure
   of completed financial documents is necessary so the system only keeps reporting active
   funding documents or those closed awaiting the end of fiscal year purge. This keeps the
   DIFMS database clean. To close the funding document funding stream in DIFMS, first all
   JONs related to a CON must be closed and final billed. Then all CONs related to a SPON
   must be final billed and closed. Then all SPONs related to a funding document must be
   closed.
      2.12.1.1. Once the funding document is closed, it is purged from the active database
      during the end of fiscal year purging. While all funding documents are opened via APO-
      J025A, they are all closed in DIFMS. The last JON on the funding document must be
      final billed 60 days prior to the end of the fiscal year for the purge to work properly. The
      closed status code on the funding document can occur any time after the final billing.
      Once APO-J025A receives an indication that DIFMS has closed the funding stream,
      APO-J025A will not let the Funds Initiator create any more adjustment Project Orders
      (POs) for that funding stream.
      2.12.1.2. After, all the JONs under the CON are closed and final billed; the unused
      funding must be de-obligated and returned to the customer as soon as possible.
   2.12.2. Upon the completion of workload, the scheduler should not take the final completion
   on a JON in Q302/G004L unless all the tasks in the Work Control Document (WCD) are
   finished and all Undelivered Orders (UDOs) have been cleared. JON closures will be fed
 54                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


   from Q302/G004L if the status code is greater than ‘2’ through JOST to DIFMS. Job Order
   Status Tool (JOST) may be used to force manually a financial closure of a JON.
      2.12.2.1. JONs cannot be reopened after closure in DIFMS without justification from the
      Maintenance Wing/FM, along with coordination and final approval determined by the
      ALC/FMR.
      2.12.2.2. The ALCs must establish JON closeout teams and checklists to review JONs
      prior to closure to account for all costs, in order to avoid funding, cost, and billing
      problems, which can occur when a JON is improperly closed. Organizations then sign
      off on the checklists after ensuring appropriate actions have been taken.
      2.12.2.3. The close out team ensures the following actions are worked and completed
      prior to JON closure:
          2.12.2.3.1. All tasks started have been completed, all backorders have been filled,
          cancelled, or moved to open JONs (no UDO’s exist for material, Doc-Job-Shop (DJS)
          Business Operations Contracts or Travel TDYs)
          2.12.2.3.2. Due in from Maintenance (DIFM) / Due Out To Maintenance (DOTM)
          have been processed correctly in ABOM/NIMMS
          2.12.2.3.3. All labor and material suspense errors have been corrected
          2.12.2.3.4. Ensure the End Item Sales Price (EISP) on temporary jobs is correct
          2.12.2.3.5. All costs have been properly recorded
2.13. JON to CON Changes
   2.13.1. The reassignment of JONs to new funding chains after JON induction is usually due
   to mistakes made when the JON was planned in Q302/G004L. The responsibility of
   changing the funding chain (usually the PON/PCN/FCRN) in Q302/G004L falls upon the
   planner/scheduler/workloader. The Q302/G004L personnel may be unaware that the
   particular JON has already been billed in DIFMS. Any attempt to reassign a billed JON to a
   new funding chain leads to a funding interface error on DIFMS Report 7310-142
   “DIFMS/SOS Errors”. Many, but not all, JON updates from Q302/G004L JON Master files
   to DIFMS data fields error until corrective action is taken.
   2.13.2. Prior to a PON/PCN/FCRN change, the Q302/G004L personnel should check the
   billing status of the JON in DIFMS. If a billed balance exists, a JON error appears on the
   DIFMS Report 7310-142 when there is a change in the Q302/G004L funding stream. The
   error code reads as follows: “3551 - CON CHANGE NOT ALLOWED WHEN ALL
   BILLED BALANCES NOT = 0”. The DIFMS 7310-142 is produced daily, and these errors
   can be reviewed in JOST. The new CON will be identified on the DIFMS Report 7310-142.
   2.13.3. The following steps must be performed to move a billed JON to a new funding chain:
      2.13.3.1. JONs cannot be reopened after closure in DIFMS without justification from the
      Maintenance Wing/FM, along with the coordination and final approval determined by the
      ALC/FMR. After coordination and approval, the planner/scheduler/workloader makes
      funding stream changes in Q302/G004L.
      2.13.3.2. Cost Accounting reverses the bills on the applicable JON(s) through DIFMS.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                         55


      2.13.3.3. After verifying that all bills have been reversed, Cost Accounting changes the
      CON on the JON to new funding chain using DIFMS Screen MS152P “Direct Job Order
      Update” or reprocess through JOST.
2.14. Funding Chain Closure
   2.14.1. To View Records Available for Closure & Processing Closures in FIT on a monthly
   basis:
      2.14.1.1. Select “Transaction Query & Maintenance Tab”
      2.14.1.2. Select “Close Funding” radio button and wait for query to run (could take up to
      5 minutes).
      2.14.1.3. Select Customer Order Transaction or Sponsor Order Transaction or Funding
      Document Transaction
      2.14.1.4. Select “Execute” button
      2.14.1.5. Records that may be closed will appear in GUI.
      2.14.1.6. To close transactions, mark the desired record via the checkbox(es) on left of
      screen and press “Close” button on far right.
   2.14.2. If there is an error in FIT GUI when attempting to close the CON, the following steps
   can be used:
      2.14.2.1. Validate that no Undelivered Order (UDO) balances exist on the CON using
      MS053P, “Customer Order Inquiry” Option ‘2’. UDO balances prevent closure of the
      funding chain. The UDO balance will need to be resolved before the CON can be closed.
   2.14.3. After the funding document final bills, the entire funding chain can be closed through
   the FIT GUI at the funding document level. Once the funding document is closed, it is
   purged from the active database during the fiscal year-end purging. The last JON on the
   funding document must final bill 60 days prior to the end of the fiscal year for the purge to
   work properly. The closed status code on the funding document can occur any time after the
   final billing.
      2.14.3.1. Prerequisite to Closure: The following criteria must first be met prior to the
      closure of the funding chain:
      2.14.3.2. All CONs under the Funding Document must have a final bill code of ‘Y’. If
      JONs under a CON have a final bill code of ‘Y’, but the CON has a final bill code of ‘N’,
      this indicates that a billing program failure or data problems exist. Additionally, this error
      must be corrected via SQL update.
      2.14.3.3. All CONs, under the Funding Document, must have a “Funds Available”
      balance of zero. If a “Funds Available” balance is present, the Funds Manager should
      remove this balance using APO-J025A. If fund available balance contains dollars and
      cents, the available dollar amount can be removed in APO-J025A, then the cents will be
      removed by FIT GUI on Rebalance Funding tab and it will feed into DIFMS to de-
      obligate cents.
      2.14.3.4. In some cases, a Funding chain may contain a CON with ‘0’ authorized
      funding, and no subordinate JONs. If such a CON exists, and it is known that this CON
 56                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      is not used in DIFMS, it can be deleted in FIT or by using the MS153P “Customer
      Identification Update” screen in DIFMS prior to closing the funding chain. If a CON is
      deleted and the funding chain is closed, the CON should never have further amendments
      processed in APO-J025A. If a CON is deleted, users must assure it will not be used
      again.
2.15. Miscellaneous Refunds/MORDS
   2.15.1. Miscellaneous refunds are transactions such as the collection of jury fees,
   overpayment of salaries, health insurance, etc. from employees. However, the frequency and
   exact amounts of these refunds are not known until the funds are received either by check or
   in a “by others” cycle.           To account for these transactions, a Miscellaneous
   Obligation/Reimbursement Document Form AF IMT 406, (frequently called a MORD) is
   established in DIFMS.
   2.15.2. “Miscellaneous Refunds” are very different from the collection of an accounts
   receivable. The collection of an accounts receivable results from the sale of supplies or
   services and is recorded as a reimbursement to the organic CSAG-Depot Maintenance
   (CSAG-DM) appropriation. A refund is just what it says it is-the “refunding” of money to
   the organic CSAG-DM appropriation due to an overpayment, etc. Refunds are recorded as a
   negative disbursement. In other words, refunds ultimately reduce the amount of the original
   disbursement.
   2.15.3. Each ALC requests MORDs to estimate the amounts of anticipated refunds to the
   organic CSAG-DM.         Each ALC determines the number of MORDs required for
   miscellaneous refunds to satisfy their business requirements. Forward each MORD to DFAS
   established “only” in DIFMS as a posting code ‘6’, with an indirect JON. This establishes a
   negative obligation in DIFMS for the amount of the MORD.
   2.15.4. When a “by other cycle” or check is received for miscellaneous refunds, DFAS
   processes the transaction with no money attached in H069/GAFS-BL/BQ. This process
   allows the transaction to pass through the DFASIE, and then post to DIFMS where it will be
   reflected on OLRV 7310-320/322 reports.
   2.15.5. The MORD in DIFMS allows the refund to be posted against the MORD with the
   indirect JON.

2.17. Closure Process for Awaiting Parts and Cancelled Job Orders
   2.17.1. CONEN sends JON Status originated in Q302/G004L (JON Status Code (JSC) 0, 1,
   2, or 3) to DIFMS.
       2.17.1.1. A Q302/G004L JSC of 0 is open without completions.          (in DIFMS, JSC
       remains open as 1)
       2.17.1.2. A Q302/G004L JSC of 1 is closed with completions, awaiting trailing costs for
       thirty days (in DIFMS, JSC remains open as 1)
58                                                          AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


     2.17.1.3. At the end of 30 days, the JSC in Q302/G004L is changed to 2 (financially
     closed). Once JOST finds there are no open tasks in TAA (all tasks are completed), the
     JON is closed in JOST and passed to DIFMS closed as JSC 3.
     2.17.1.4. A Q302/G004L JSC 3 identifies the JON as cancelled, which will become a
     DIFMS JSC 6 unless it has costs or billing. JONs cancelled in G004L with cost/billing
     incurred appear as errors in JOST. These errors also show on DIFMS OLRV Report
     7310-142 (2081, 2831, 3488 error messages). Customers will be billed for actual costs
     (rounded up to the nearest dollar) up to Extended End Item Sale Price (EEISP) on true
     cancelled workload. In DIFMS, change JSC to 3 and set EISP to actual cost to the
     nearest dollar.
  2.17.2. Reduced orders and cancelled JONs are often created due to Awaiting Parts (AWP).
  If a JON is cancelled due to awaiting parts, condemnation, or end items move to another
  JON, change the DIFMS status code to 7- Depot takes loss.
  2.17.3. The responsible person for the AWP and/or canceling a JON should check DIFMS
  Inquiry Screen MS052P Job Order, Option 2 for costs prior to canceling a JON. Cost
  accounting chief should review action taken on cancelled JONs.

3.1. Labor Systems
   3.1.1. The official System of record for processing Labor is DMAPS (Depot Maintenance
   and Production System). The DMAPS environment is shown in Figure 3.1 below. .
   Employees transact labor into the production systems and Time and Attendance System
   (TAA). TAA sends labor transactions to Defense Industrial Financial Management System
   (DIFMS) and to the Defense Civilian Payroll System (DCPS). DCPS provides rates to
   DIFMS through TAA. DCPS is the payroll processing system for civilian employees and is
   reconciled to DIFMS. DIFMS passes data to the DMAPS Data Store System (DDS), which
   is then viewed in the Cost and Production Performance Module (CPPM) of the Cost,
   Production, and Budget Module (CPBM/H033). The DMAPS Conversion Engine (CONEN)
   provides a means for data transfer.

Figure 3.1. DMAPS Labor Environment




   3.1.2. TAA is a production-oriented, operational information system whose purpose is to
   provide a standard, automated means of collecting and reporting labor data. TAA input data
   is received directly from user input, existing production systems, DCPS, and DIFMS.
   Collected labor data is reported through interfaces with DIFMS, DDS, and DCPS. Data is
60                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


  also fed back to some of the production systems. Data feeds to TAA are described in the
  following paragraphs.
     3.1.2.1. The Programmed Depot Maintenance Scheduling System (Q302/G097-PDMSS)
     is used for management of serialized repair items applicable to the Aircraft and Missiles
     divisions. PDMSS is used to construct an operational level network showing all tasks
     and their relationships to other tasks required to complete the depot modification and/or
     depot repair of an aircraft or missile. When operations are qualified in Q302/G097 and
     are properly funded, they are passed to TAA and become available for labor transactions.
     This same data is also passed to the DMAPS Data Store System (DDS) to collect and
     maintain historical data at the operational level.
     3.1.2.2. The Inventory Tracking System (Q302/G337-ITS) is used for management of
     depot programmed exchangeable items and routed consumable items repair. When assets
     are properly funded, inducted, and Work Control Documents (WCD) have been printed,
     tasks / operations / sub-operations / track points are passed to TAA and become available
     for labor transactions. This same data is passed to DDS to collect and maintain historical
     data at the task / operation / sub-operation / track point level.
     3.1.2.3. The Facilities Equipment Maintenance System (D130/FEM) is used for
     management of facilities and equipment maintenance for all services. Precision
     Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) workload is managed through FEM and
     linked to direct ‘C’ Job Order Numbers (JON) and indirect Cost Class IV ‘S’ JONs for
     the maintenance of Resource Control Center (RCC) equipment. Some Plant Management
     workloads are linked to ‘T’ JONs and transacted against using the TAA JON Labor
     screen not the D130/PMEL Labor screen.
     3.1.2.4. The Job Order Production Master System (Q302/G004L-JOPMS) is used for the
     management of temporary workloads. Workloads such as occasional overhaul or repair,
     level of effort, inspections, testing, manufacturing, and temporary duty (TDY) are typical
     temporary workloads planned only in Q302/G004L. These workloads create Work
     Control Documents (WCDs) in Q302/G337 and in Q302/G097. This information is also
     passed on to TAA and DSS. These workloads can also be transacted against by those
     track point or operation numbers in TAA, along with JON level transactions. The JON is
     initiated in a valid number sequence in Q302/G004L, passed to the CONEN, then to
     DIFMS for funding validation then returned to Q302/G004L. The valid JON is the only
     information fed to TAA from DIFMS; therefore, only JON-level transacting can be input
     in TAA.
     3.1.2.5. Earned hours for temporary JONs are accumulated by either JON level
     transactions or the accumulation of actual hours by task (track points / operations) up to
     the Q302/G004L labor plan rolled up to the Resource Control Center (RCC). Then after
     the JON reaches a Q302/G004L status code of 2, any remaining planned hours are
     automatically earned by that planned RCC.
  3.1.3. DIFMS provides valid indirect JONs, and Resource RCCs, to TAA and validates
  funding on new production JONs. When production JONs for Q302/G097, Q302/G337,
  Q302/G004L, and D130/FEM are validated in DIFMS, they are sent to TAA for labor
  transacting.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                    61


  3.1.4. Department of Defense (DoD) civilian employees are paid by the Defense Civilian
  Pay System (DCPS). After TAA has submitted payroll data to DCPS bi-weekly, DCPS
  computes pay and leave balances and sends updated leave balances (MER31 – P6722D01) to
  TAA. DCPS sends grade, series, and rate of pay information to TAA weekly (MER21 –
  P6631D01). This data is processed in TAA updating each civilian employee’s Master
  Employee Record (MER) Maintenance Table with grade, series, and rate of pay information
  and leave balances. When DCPS sends employee data changes to TAA, only the Master
  Employee Record table is updated. DCPS also provides a bi-weekly gross pay file to DIFMS
  for labor reconciliation (P3306D04 is sent as the MS236D30 (formerly the MS236D11)).
  3.1.5. DMAPS Data Store System (DDS) provides a persistent data store for historical data
  elements (including labor), which are either not held by the DMAPS suite of systems or not
  held on a long-term basis. DDS provides a relational database repository allowing a variety
  of functional end users to inquire and retrieve production information. The system is part of
  DMAPS Integration Engine (DMAPS-IE).
  3.1.6. DMAPS Conversion Engine (CONEN) facilitates the movement and translation of
  data between the DMAPS suite of systems and other Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC)
  and Air Force (AF) legacy systems. The system is part of the DMAPS-IE.
  3.1.7. DMAPS Cost, Production, and Budget Module (CPBM/H033) is a management
  information system that provides financial and production information as well as essential
  performance indicators to each Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) manager. H033
  supports these managers by providing online, day-to-day reports showing the visibility of
  their operating costs and production performance. This allows managers to compare actual
  results with the financial budget and production targets.
  3.1.8. During each daily TAA batch processing cycle, labor transactions are accumulated in
  the ZH140D02 file for DIFMS. Records from the ZH140D02 file that fail DIFMS validation
  are shown as un-allocated labor in Part I of the DIFMS Report 7310-541 “Outstanding
  Unallocated Labor”. During each DIFMS batch processing cycle, valid direct labor
  transactions (computed as actual direct hours and dollars) are fed to DDS on the MS234D10
  file and valid indirect labor transactions are passed to DDS on the MS234D09 file.
  Adjustment records are passed in separate files based on the type of adjustment and via
  DIFMS Program MS276P (Process Wage Rate for TAA). DDS processes labor records to
  the H033_dir_lab and the H033_indir_labor warehouse tables. H033 extracts labor data from
  the DDS on a daily basis via an Oracle-to-Oracle connection.
     3.1.8.1. At the end of each pay period, labor adjustments (i.e., missing time, un-
     reconciled time, etc.) in TAA are sent to DIFMS in the ZH440D02 file as part of payroll
     processing. Un-reconciled time in TAA passes as incomplete data and is held as un-
     reconciled labor in Part II of the DIFMS Report 7310-541 (i.e., 7G0EROR). 7G0EROR
     records are written to the ZE305D02 file for Robins and Tinker and sent to DIFMS;
     Ogden and Kadena 7G0EROR records are written to ZE352D07 and also sent to DIFMS.
     3.1.8.2. After each pay period is completed, TAA compiles a payroll file (ZE332D01) to
     send to DCPS for civilian pay. Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)
     Indianapolis determines the timeframe when each file must be received in DCPS to
     ensure payroll is computed and paid out timely. Whenever there is a holiday in the same
     week as a payday, DFAS requires organizations to send payroll files early. DCPS
62                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


     processing starts with an initial run to identify missing time. Missing time is then sent to
     Payroll clerks and timekeepers to correct the missing time errors followed by a final
     payroll run in DCPS. DCPS then provides a payroll file to DIFMS for reconciliation
     between labor and payroll costs. See local guidance for further details regarding the
     reconciliation process.
     3.1.8.3. As employees transact against Q302/G337, Q302/G097, and D130/FEM
     operations, the various start, logon, delay, logoff, and complete statuses are captured and
     then sent to DDS in the DDS-Stat file during each TAA batch processing cycle.
     3.1.8.4. As DIFMS and DDS receive files from their feeder systems, all records are
     validated. Those not meeting validation criteria are rejected. Rejected records must be
     reviewed and corrected via reprocessed data files. Figure 3.2 shows the labor rejected
     record tables for DIFMS, DDS, and CPBM/H033.
        3.1.8.4.1. TAA sends eligibility data to DIFMS via email in the ZE860D01 file when
        situations occur that require new eligibility rules or revision to current rules (i.e.,
        DCPS adds new type hour codes). Please note that DCPS is the source of the
        Eligibility Table.
        3.1.8.4.2. TAA Bulk Processing transactions are processed as any other labor
        transaction and sent to DIFMS via the ZH140D02 file.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                   63


Figure 3.2. Labor Data Flow




3.2. Labor Categories
   3.2.1. New employees, as well as those transitioning employees changing to/from a different
   Employee Type Code must be added into TAA within the current pay period to avoid
   improper allocation of costs. It is imperative that accurate and timely accounting of
   employee labor expenses be included in DIFMS. To accomplish this, the type of position in
   which an employee is hired and entered in TAA must be accurate and timely. The
   procedures for determining employee types are identified in the following paragraphs.
   Following is a list of the employee type codes in TAA.
 64                                                               AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014

   3.2.2. Supervisors and timekeepers have the responsibility of contacting the TAA functional
   OPRs to have an employee number created for their new employees. Adding new employees
   in TAA, as well as any other personnel changes, must be made in TAA within the current
   pay period. Any backdated transactions and/or schedule updates must occur within the
   current pay period process through the daily batch processing prior to adding any labor
   records through Daily Labor Correction Process (DLCP) for the new employee. After the
   batch processing has occurred, the responsible supervisor or timekeeper adds labor records
   through DLCP for each workday of the pay period that has passed. Any payroll/personnel
   adjustment transactions outside of the current pay period will error in DIFMS and require
   adjustment of funds (SF1081 – Voucher and Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits). DIFMS
   Error reports can be viewed in OLRV via 7310-525. See DIFMS Error Corrections for
   detail.
   3.2.3. Funded civilian employees are designated by employee type codes 1, 3, 4, and 6.
   TAA civilian labor hours worked in a cost center are to be recorded on a job order number or
   JON, as either a direct cost or indirect cost. Direct hours are to be recorded at the task level
   (e.g., operation or track point). DIFMS uses the current payroll rate and an acceleration
   factor for personnel benefits to price the labor hours. There are several categories of Funded
   Civilian employees as reflected in Table 3.1 above. The majorities of employees in TAA are
   in and funded by Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group/Depot Maintenance (CSAG-
   DM), and these employees are typically General GS/SES or WG/WL/WS positions. The
   criteria for determining whether to add an employee to TAA is contained within the AF 21-
   136.
       3.2.3.1. CSAG-DM funded employees have a Program Element Code (PEC) of 78211A
       in Block 36 of the Standard Form (SF) 50, Notification of Personnel Action. Employees
       with this PEC code must be added to TAA. All CSAG-DM funded employees, both
       civilian and military, must be added to TAA using the ‘TAA Employee Type Code’ field
       to identify the type of employee.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                       65


  3.2.4. Non ALC-Funded Labor
     3.2.4.1. Non-CSAG-DM Funded Supervisors and Timekeepers have occasion to access
     TAA to manage CSAG-DM-funded employee records under their supervision or
     timekeeping control. Establish a TAA Employee Master Record for these employees
     using an Employee Type Code ‘7’ and a Payroll Prefix of ‘000’ to ensure no labor is
     passed to DIFMS. Use a ‘P’ in the work schedule designating them as a part-time
     employee to allow their schedule to be zeroed out in the Employee Schedule screen.
     Note: Non-funded Government employees, such as Palace Acquire employees, must not
     be input into TAA. These employees are maintained only within DCPS.
     3.2.4.2. Depot Organic Contract Augmented Team (DOCAT) employees perform direct
     labor work such as shop floor production, production or material planner, scheduler, or
     expediter tasks. Add DOCAT employees to TAA using TAA Employee Type Code ‘8’,
     with a Payroll Prefix of ‘111’ in their Employee Master Record. The contract line item
     rate is used as their hourly wage rate in the Master Employee Record (MER)
     Maintenance Table. Review and update the wage rate monthly as needed.
     3.2.4.3. Review DIFMS Reports 7310-525 "Labor Detail Transaction Report" and 7310-
     694 (Part II) “Contractor Labor Transfers” within OLRV to determine contract
     transactions that did not process. The DIFMS labor module calculates, posts, and stores
     contractual labor costs. The labor posting for contractual labor is to memorandum
     accounts based upon the employee type code. DIFMS calculates and posts labor charges
     in the statistical accounts (other direct cost) using information entered into the MS724,
     "Contract Labor Transfer Table Update" screen by Cost Accounting. DIFMS transfers
     the hour and labor costs to the direct JONs worked by using the Contractual Labor Cost
     Transfer screen (MS694P) and the 7310-694 report. Hourly labor costs for Contractor
     Labor are provided to Cost Accounting by Budgeting
  3.2.5. Record all military hours worked as either a direct cost on a job order or as an indirect
  cost of a cost center. DIFMS charges military labor hours to the job order based on the
  military labor rate on the www.opm.gov website. There are two categories of military
  employees, (1) military employees working in CSAG-DM-funded positions, or (2) military
  employees completing work for CSAG-DM but not employed in CSAG-DM-funded
  positions. Within these categories, there is a distinction between officers and enlisted
  employees.
     3.2.5.1. Categorize funded military as funded officers or funded enlisted. Add funded
     officers to TAA using Employee type code ‘0’ in their Master Employee Record (MER).
     Add funded enlisted to TAA using Employee type code ‘9’ in their MER.
         3.2.5.1.1. AFSC Organic depot maintenance receives the annual military assessment
         letter from HQ AFSC/FMR. Based on the assessment amount, prepare a MIPR for
         the amount, with JON and Shop designated, and a Cost Code with position 1 and 2
         equal to ‘ST’.
         3.2.5.1.2. Each ALC inputs the commitment into DIFMS via the DIFMS Screen
         MS112P “Asset/ Liability Update” and inputs the commitment to General Accounting

          3.2.5.1.3. H069/GAFS-BL/BQ feeds the obligation to DIFMS via the DFAS
          Integration Engine (DFAS-IE). This is an outgoing funding document. When the
          obligation is received from the DFAS-IE, the ALC adjusts the record via DIFMS
          Screen MS112P and changes the posting code to ‘8’ so the amount is accrued.
      3.2.5.2. Categorize non-funded military as unfunded military officers or enlisted. Add
      military officers to TAA using Employee Type Code ‘2’ in their Master Employee
      Record (MER). Add military enlisted to TAA using Employee Type Code ‘5’ in their
      Master Employee Record.
      3.2.5.3. TAA requires that all hours of a Non-Funded Combat Logistics Support
      Squadron (CLSS) Military employee’s tour of duty work schedule be recorded. There
      are periods of time during their TAA tour of duty that CLSS military members are not
      working for the CSAG-DM.           Assign CLSS military squadron duties to the
      X53104200000 JON as their standing JON in TAA. When performing work for a
      CSAG-DM organization, charge employees’ time to a direct JON. Determine when
      CLSS costs should be charged to the customer, such as FMS.
      3.2.5.4. Leave for military employees should be input on the TAA JON Labor screen
      using the following indirect JONs:

   Production overhead (POH) is tracked on X JONs, while general and administrative (G&A)
   overhead is tracked on Y JONs. Positions 6 and 7 of the indirect labor JONs contain the duty
   codes as defined below.

   3.2.7. Other Indirect Labor JONs. Identified below are other labor JONs specifically
   identified for military and contractor (DOCAT) employees when not performing direct labor
   work for organic depot maintenance. The indirect JONs for DOCAT labor contains ‘X5111’
   in positions 1-5. The duty code in positions 6-7 vary depending on the breakout of charges.
   The indirect JONs for military labor contain ‘X5310’ or ‘Y6310’ in positions 1-5. The duty
   code in positions 6-7 vary depending on the breakout of charges. When not at work for any
   circumstance such as vacation or illness, DOCAT employees use ‘Leave Without Pay’ (KA)
   Z61633976000. The ‘KA’ type hour code should also be used when contractors are
   participating in contractor-directed training defined as training required and paid for by the
   contractor for their employees.
3.3. TAA Processing
   3.3.1. DoD           7000.14-R,          Vol.           11B,            Chapter           13,
   (http://comptroller.defense.gov/fmr/11b/index.html) requires that all civilian labor hours
   worked in a cost center are recorded on a job order as either a direct cost or as an indirect
   cost. For organic depot maintenance, this is accomplished through TAA. AFSCI 21-136,
   Depot Maintenance Production Labor Entry, Feb 03, provides policy and procedures for
   TAA-related             labor            processing.                          http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFSCI21-136.pdf
3.4. Military Labor Processing
   3.4.1. DIFMS Program MS234P “Process Current Cycle Labor Data” distributes the military
   labor hours reported by TAA. The Funded Military section of the DIFMS Report 7310-565
   “Labor Distribution Summary by Expense Account” shows the direct and indirect military
   labor costs. This report shows an expense update to United States Standard General Ledger
   (USSGL) Account 610000Dx (1, 2, 3, 4) and a liability to USSGL account 221041A1 for the
   amount of military labor worked.
   3.4.2. A Document-Job-Shop (DJS or Doc-Job-Shop) record is created in DIFMS for the
   Military Assessment. This would be based on a MORD that would be established as a
70                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


  commitment in DIFMS and H069/GAFS-BL/BQ; The obligation would be established in
  H069/GAFS-BL/BQ and sent to DIFMS via the DFAS-IE. Change the Posting Code to an
  ‘8’ versus the default posting code ‘5’. The use of the ‘ST’ cost code is appropriate for the
  military assessment, although the accrual calculation is different from the Posting Code ‘1’
  accrual process.
  3.4.3. Set the accrual amount to the assessment reflected in the EOY Memo received by HQ
  AFSC/FMR and the effective date to the beginning and ending of the fiscal year. During
  each accrual period, DIFMS compares the Year-To-Date (YTD) amount sent from TAA
  labor to the YTD accrual amount (e.g. MORD) calculated in Business Operations - Other
  Costs (See Chapter 5). The difference is posted to the JON (Y63100000000) cited on the
  assessment record. With the Posting Code ‘8’ process, the amount of the military assessment
  is charged based on accrual process adjustments.
     3.4.3.1. The accrual process in Business Operations (Other) Cost calculates YTD accrual
     value for military labor cycle based on the annual assessment recorded on the Doc-Job-
     Shop record. This process compares the calculated value to the extended military labor
     cost to the military assessment accrual, and posts the necessary adjustments (debit or
     credit) to the USSGL account 221041A1 liability account and the USSGL account
     610000D4 expense account.
     3.4.3.2. The comparison process should keep the accrued costs in line with the 1/12th
     accrual value each month. The amount for military labor is in the General Ledger
     Accounts per DIFMS Report 7310-935 “General Ledger Trial Balance”. DIFMS Report
     7310-915 “General Ledger Details Year-to-Date” shows the journal vouchers posted.
     DIFMS Report 7310-565 “Labor Distribution Summary by Expense Account” shows the
     labor Journal Voucher (JV). DIFMS Report 7310-605 “Schedule of Accruals” shows the
     in Business Operations (Other) Cost accrual ‘SA’ JV.
  3.4.4. Payment to the Military Appropriation: Cash transactions process via H069/GAFS-
  BL/BQ and the DFAS-IE for the payment to the military appropriation. DFAS-IE matches to
  the obligation record in DIFMS. The process does not require that an accrued amount be
  more than the payment amount.
     3.4.4.1. These records have a “normal” remaining balance due to the variance of the cost
     being incurred by the funded military labor transactions themselves. The objective of
     closing the record is to not write off or adjust any remaining balance in the USSGL
     account 221041A2. Instead, the DIFMS Program MS265P "Process Accruals" factors in
     the difference of the cost incurred by the funded military labor transactions (by pulling it
     from the “dummy” Doc-Job-Shop record that holds this cost) and make the determination
     of when to close the record automatically. Because the record being closed still holds a
     balance in the 221041A2 account, the closure action creates an offsetting posting to the
     221041A1 account.
     3.4.4.2. The DIFMS Program MS265P also increments the accrual amount on the
     Posting Code ‘8’ Document Job Shop record by the amount of the difference from the
     military labor worked when setting the Status Code to ‘3’ (Closed) on that record. In
     addition, the “dummy” Military Labor record for that fiscal year has its accrual amount
     reduced to zero, with the amount that had been there moved to the Authorized-Obligation
     field on that record for historical traceability. These updates serve two purposes. If the
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                        71


      Posting-Code ‘8’ record is ever manually re-opened, no balances for the USSGL account
      221041A2 appear on the DIFMS Report 7310-645 “Asset Liability Balances”.
      Additionally, if the record then “re-closes” a second time, no adjustment to the USSGL
      account 221041A1 is made unless additional labor cost had been incurred since the first
      closure.
3.5. Depot Organic Contract Augmentee Team (DOCAT) Process
   3.5.1. DOCAT employees perform direct labor work such as shop floor production,
   planning, scheduling, or expediter tasks.
   3.5.2. Set up the DOCAT contract with a Contractual Other Code (COC) of ‘05’, ‘credit’
   Indirect JON (X55310998000), Cost Code of ‘SU’, and one AOC or RCC for each Contract
   Line Item Number (CLIN) in each Division. If not direct, transactions should be on an
   indirect job order within the RCC so the DMAPS process automatically allocates the indirect
   charges. DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 11B, Chapter 13, paragraph 1309 states the costs for
   purchased services are treated as “other” and charged as direct unless the services are for
   indirect cost centers.
   3.5.3. Load information on DOCAT employees in TAA as Employee Type Code ‘8’and use
   the composite rate from the contract associated with the employee. It is recommended that
   this rate be used in TAA to ensure correct hourly rate is sent to DIFMS for labor transacted in
   TAA. Set up a Transfer Table in the DIFMS Screen MS724P “Contract Labor Transfer
   Table Update”. The screen includes the COC of ‘05’, the credit JON from the contract, and a
   composite rate for each RCC. Users must enter the two-digit COC, otherwise the entry
   rejects. The composite rate is calculated from contract skill code rates.
   3.5.4. DOCAT employees transact labor in TAA. TAA then sends labor to DIFMS daily.
   DIFMS Program MS694P uses the actual hours worked and hourly rate set in MS724P
   screen to credit the contract JON and charge the labor JONs where the actual hours were
   transacted. Through the labor distribution process (MS234P), DIFMS records statistical cost
   for the DOCAT labor by debiting JON/RCC from TAA and crediting indirect JON on
   contract/RCC from TAA. Due to the use of COC ‘05’ on DIFMS Update Screen MS724P,
   direct JON/RCC expense posts to Direct Other (USSGL account 610000P2) instead of Direct
   Labor (USSGL account 610000A2). When an Indirect Labor JON is transacted instead of a
   Direct Labor JON, the costs goes to Overhead Other (USSGL account 610000P3) instead of
   Direct Other (USSGL account 610000P2).
      3.5.4.1. Transaction-level errors coming from the source labor data are validated and
      rejected within the labor subsystem itself, thereby greatly reducing the instance and scope
      of handling errors within the DIFMS Program MS694P "Contract Labor Transfers".
      Validation within the labor subsystem for Employee Type Code ‘8’ (Non-ALC
      Employee) first checks for existence of a Contract-Labor-Transfer record
      (DIFMS_CNTR_LAB_TRNS). If none exists, the labor transaction errs with a 3908
      error message. If one does exist, then the program utilizes the Contractual/Other Code
      from that record to determine whether to validate the third position of the Restriction-
      Code of the ‘transaction’ JON as contractual (01-50) or other (51-99). Values of ‘1’ or
      ‘2’ are good for contractual; ‘1’, ‘3’, or ‘4’ are good for other. Validation of the ‘Charge’
      JON ensures that the source labor transaction is against a JON that is authorized to accept
      ’non labor’ charges.
72                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


     3.5.4.2. DIFMS Program MS694P, which produces the MS694D04 rejected transaction
     file, is able to reprocess rejected transactions. Errors appear on OLRV-7310-541 Report.
     The primary error condition (Error 3908 – Contract Labor Transfer Table Does Not
     Exist) is received when a transaction has been entered against an RCC that has not been
     established on the MS724P screen. Corrective action may require establishment of
     Contract Labor Transfer Table using the MS724P screen or correct the RCC on the
     rejected labor transaction by using the MS143P screen.
         3.5.4.2.1. Other errors associated with the Contract-Labor-Transfer record itself
         (DIFMS_CNTR_LAB_TRNS) such as a ‘no longer valid’ Credit JON (which would
         need to be fixed using the DIFMS Update Screen MS724P) or a bad Restriction-Code
         on the Credit JON (which would need to be fixed using the DIFMS Update Screen
         MS151P). DIFMS Program MS694P only allows Restriction-Code position 3 values
         of ‘1’, ‘3’ or ‘4’ for the Credit JON when the Contractual/Other Code is between ‘51’
         and ‘99’ (Other).
         3.5.4.2.2. The program ignores transactions against JON types of “Leave” (e.g.
         Indirect-Jon-Type ‘L’ that begins with a “Z” followed by the JON number for the
         appropriate leave account) or “GLA JON” (e.g. Indirect JON Type ‘A’ that begins
         with “W” followed by the GLAC).
         3.5.4.2.3. These transactions are not reported or retained as errors
  3.5.5. Contract payments processed in H069/GAFS-BL/BQ are interfaced to DIFMS through
  the DFASIE. The payments debit the indirect JON/AOC on the contract and credit cash.
  Reconcile the expense from the DIFMS Report 7310-732 “Indirect Costs By Shop Within
  Jon Year-To-Date” to the H069/GAFS-BL/BQ payments
  3.5.6. It is recommended Cost Accounting and Budget personnel monitor the mix of skill
  codes used in each RCC and adjust the composite rates as appropriate. A credit on the
  contract JON/Administrative Overhead Center (AOC) identifies the government’s liability to
  the contractor at a point in time or high rate on DIFMS Update Screen MS724P. A debit on
  the contract JON/AOC indicates a low rate, erring labor on the DIFMS Report 7310-694 (no
  transfer table set up), or DOCAT employees are not transacting correctly. DIFMS uses the
  DIFMS Program MS694P to expense DOCAT labor in DIFMS by debiting Direct JON /
  Direct RCC in Direct Other due to COC of ‘5’ and crediting Indirect JON on contract /
  Direct RCC The following figure is a basic DOCAT process flow chart.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                      73


Figure 3.3. DOCAT Process Flow




   3.5.7. The following areas need to be watched when processing DOCAT transactions and
   information.
      3.5.7.1. Composite rate by RCC needs to be monitored. When composite rates change,
      the local TAA OPR must be notified so that the Master Employee Record can be
      manually updated in TAA to ensure correct rate is applied to employee’s labor.
      3.5.7.2. Cost transfers need to be done monthly.
      3.5.7.3. Composite rate calculated from contract skill code rates (add 10% for overtime).
      3.5.7.4. The COC needs to be ‘05’ since this is what designates the expense to go to
      direct other instead of direct labor even though it is using the direct RCC and direct JON.
      3.5.7.5. Reconcile the expense from the DIFMS Report 7310-732 to the H069/GAFS-
      BL/BQ payments.
      3.5.7.6. A small credit in ‘X5531’, Prime Vendor Other at AOC level identifies the
      government’s liability to the contractor at a point.
      3.5.7.7. A debit in ‘X5531’ at AOC level indicates a problem with the rates in DIFMS,
      and/or erring labor on DIFMS Report 7310-694 (no transfer table set up), and/or DOCAT
      employees are not transacting correctly.
         3.5.7.7.1. DIFMS Report 7310-694 "Contract Labor Transfers" supports posting to
         the General Ledger and is a reference for cost center transfers. This report shows the
         charge to the JON being worked as well as the credit to the overhead DOCAT JON
 74                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


          (cited on the contract). The costs to the original JON is treated as contractual/other,
          not as labor charges. However, the actual labor hours stay on the labor JONs. The
          process redistributes the contract cost to the actual JONs that it benefits. This process
          posts a journal voucher type "CL" to the general ledger.
          3.5.7.7.2. The credits as processed in DIFMS Program MS694P are posted against
          the direct RCC; however, the DOCAT contracts are often written against an AOC
          (Accounting Organization Code) overhead shop. In these cases, a cost transfer using
          DIFMS MS144P Screen "Cost Adjustment Update" must be processed to move the
          credit from the direct shops to the AOC.
3.6. Cost Transfers.
   3.6.1. Cost transfers occasionally need to be performed to get labor hours and costs to the
   correct JON/Shop combination. Cost transfers are submitted to Cost Accounting for review,
   approval, and performance of the transaction.
   3.6.2. DOCAT Labor Cost Transfer. Perform cost transfers at the end of the month to
   move costs from the RCC in TAA to the RCC on the contract. Use AOC where the contract
   was written at the AOC level. A cost transfer is not necessary if the contracts are written in
   the shops where the labor is performed.
      3.6.2.1. The cost transfer needs to be a debit of total dollars to the TAA RCC and a credit
      to the RCC/AOC where the contract was written. The cost transfer request needs to
      include JON, Shop, Type charge code ‘P’, Contractual Other Code ‘05’, and Adjustment
      amount. Enter a debit entry for the TAA RCC and a credit entry to move the cost to the
      contract RCC/AOC. Once this information is provided to cost accounting, enter the cost
      transfers into the DIFMS Update Screen MS144P “Cost Adjustment”. The next day,
      verify the transfer occurred correctly on the DIFMS Report 7310-905 “Cost
      Adjustments”. Perform a manual cost transfer monthly to debit the indirect JON on
      contract for the direct RCC and credit indirect JON on contract / AOC. For verification,
      use the DIFMS Report 7310-732 “Indirect Costs by Shop within JON Year-To-Date”.
      When the payment comes through H069/GAFS-BL/BQ, there will occur a debit to the
      Indirect JON on Contract / AOC and Credits Cash.
      3.6.2.2. DIFMS Update Screen MS144P and related processes allow Contractor Hours to
      be input when using Type Charge Codes ‘P’ (Contractual) and ‘Q’ (Other). DIFMS
      Program MS267P “Apply Cost Adjustments” performs updates to Contractual/Other
      Hours-Current-Cycle fields on Direct and Indirect Contractual/Other Cost records.
      DIFMS Reports 7310-955 “Cost Adjustments by Direct Job Order” and 7310-960 “Cost
      Adjustments by Expense Account” display Contractual/Other Hours for Type-Charge-
      Codes ‘P’ and ‘Q’ when they are present on the cost adjustments. DIFMS output file
      MS609D02 contains Contractual/Other hours in the existing Contractual/Other Hour
      fields when they have been entered for Type-Charge-Codes ‘P’ and ‘Q’. This data is also
      passed to the DMAPS Data Store as a source of information for the Contractual/Other
      Hours associated with DOCAT labor. The program also populates the Direct and Indirect
      Contractual/Other Expenditure History records on the database with the
      Contractual/Other hours that have been entered for Type-Charge-Codes ‘P’ and ‘Q’.
3.7. DIFMS Labor Processing
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                       75


   3.7.1. Overview - Labor Flow. The basic flow of labor into DIFMS is shown below in
   Figure 3.4. Employees transact labor into production systems or directly into TAA. TAA
   collects and sends the labor transactions to DIFMS to record labor costs and hours. TAA
   feeds payroll information to DCPS, which is then reconciled to DIFMS. TAA and DIFMS
   pass data to the DDS that is then passed on to H033. TAA passes labor operations status and
   earned hours. DIFMS passes actual hours and cost.

Figure 3.4. DIFMS Processing of Labor Information




   3.7.2. Extension. DIFMS extends TAA labor transactions by multiplying labor hours by
   employee pay rates. For example, 8 hours times $20 per hour is $160. TAA provides
   DIFMS with the labor hours and pay rates. DIFMS processes labor extension in DIFMS
   Program MS227P. Labor extension applies to all employee types. For overtime, DIFMS
   calculates labor extension for exempt employees (military, contractors, and salaried civilians)
   at no less than their regular rate of basic pay for overtime work.
   3.7.3. Validation. DIFMS applies edit and validation criteria in DIFMS Program MS234P
   to incoming labor transactions from TAA. These criteria include, but are not limited to:
   JON, shop, employee type, and type hour code. Transactions failing these criteria are shown
   on Part I of DIFMS Report 7310-541 “Outstanding Unallocated Labor”.
   3.7.4. Acceleration. DIFMS accelerates the extended labor amount based on ALC-
   developed acceleration factors established in DIFMS Update Screen MS166P “Acceleration
   Rates”. For example, $160 extended labor amount with a 50% factor is $240 (($160 * .5) +
76                                                             AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


  $160 = $240). Labor acceleration is done to recover the Government’s cost for civilian leave
  and fringe benefits. DIFMS processes acceleration in DIFMS Program MS234P. Military
  labor and DOCAT is not accelerated.
     3.7.4.1. If a customer requests the use of overtime that is over and above normal depot
     maintenance overtime to expedite/accelerate a workload and improve the originally
     negotiated schedule, the customer must be charged the additional cost. Acceleration of
     the work schedule tends to hamper the normal flow of work and causes gaps in
     production such that follow-on work absorbs higher than planned overhead and causes
     depot maintenance losses. The customers who benefit from the use of additional
     overtime pay the cost of the additional overtime.
     3.7.4.2. Depot maintenance may not charge additional overtime to the customer when
     overtime is used at the convenience of depot maintenance to make up for schedule
     slippage or workload backlogs. To charge for additional overtime, the customer must
     request the additional overtime and be willing to pay for it. Renegotiation of the price
     must be done when the customer decides to accelerate the work. Funding for the
     additional cost must be provided at that time, before the acceleration begins. Additional
     costs that are a direct result of the customer's decision to accelerate the workload should
     also be charged to the customer. Documentation to support all additional costs due to the
     decision to accelerate the workload must be attached to the work order and retained.
  3.7.5. Overhead Application. DIFMS applies overhead daily as direct labor is performed.
  H033 Budget Target Module (BTM) can be used to determine Overhead Application Rates
  (OAR) for production and General and Administrative (G&A) overhead for each RCC and
  sends to DIFMS. Overhead is applied to all direct hours regardless of employee type.
  3.7.6. Distribution. The DIFMS Program MS234P distributes labor hours, costs and
  applied overhead to individual JON, Shop, and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
  combinations. This program also updates DIFMS general ledger with liability and expense
  account postings through a ‘LD’ Journal Voucher (JV) shown on the DIFMS Report 7310-
  565 “Labor Distribution Summary by Expense Account”. DIFMS Report 7310-565 is
  broken into sections for funded civilian, unfunded civilian, funded military and unfunded
  military.
  3.7.7. Payroll Processing. DCPS provides data to DIFMS through the gross pay file
  (MS236Add File Number). DCPS is the system of record for payroll, so process required
  adjustments in DIFMS as appropriate.
     3.7.7.1. DCPS provides Civilian Pay Accrual to H069/GAFS-BL/BQ via existing
     interface and inputs/stores accruals in GAFS. H069/GAFS-BL/BQ receives and records
     DCPS accruals via H069/GAFS-BL/BQ program NBQI00. From the DCPS interface,
     DIFMS reconciles the gross civilian pay, as well as adding, retention pay, cash awards,
     recruitment, and other items. The accrual amounts are relieved based on the payment in
     DCPS, through a manual journal voucher. The 7310-556 report shows the employee
     contributions for benefits.
     3.7.7.2. The DCPS disbursement is recorded into DIFMS with a manual journal voucher.
     The following is used to record the disbursement in DIFMS. The DFAS associate
     obtains the necessary data from the DCPS report, Employee directory listing (PCN:
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     77


      SH002LR6L), found in the DAYTON CPAIS-E4 folder.               The report is indexed as
      E4R6L-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY.
          3.7.7.2.1. Each payroll cycle, DCPS processes a payroll voucher to show the
          amounts paid to employees, and the various fringe benefit accounts. DCPS also
          provides a total amount disbursed against the appropriate appropriation, which funds
          that account. Although these cash disbursements are a Cash function, the manual
          journal voucher process is the current method used to record these actions.
          3.7.7.2.2. The lump sum payroll summary amount is recorded in H069/GAFS-
          BL/BQ as a BAL ID of “M”. This value is processed from H069/GAFS-BL/BQ to
          the DFASIE, but it is not passed to DIFMS. DFAS processes this journal voucher
          directly into the General Ledger portion of DIFMS to account for these transactions
          each payroll cycle. The journal voucher recorded is not reversed in the next month
          because the Override Code is made ‘Y’ to signal “no reversal”.
   3.7.8. Posting to the USSGL. The posting of all types of labor (Civilian, Military,
   Contractors, and Free Labor) on all types of JONs (Direct, Production Overhead (POH),
   G&A, or Leave) can be found in the DIFMS documentation under the physical model,
   section 2-Labor, 02ms234p.
3.8. DIFMS Labor Reconcillation
   3.8.1. DIFMS Labor Reconciliation is a comparison of the labor entered in TAA for the
   previous pay period, by employee (ZE332D01), compared to what was actually paid to the
   employee by DFAS (via DCPS) for the same pay period.
   3.8.2. OLRV7310-525 is the report showing all errors resulting from Payroll Reconciliation,
   but a specially written query may also be created in COGNOS to provide duplicate results in
   a manageable Excel format. See local FZRD guidance for further details regarding DIFMS
   Labor Reconciliation process.
   3.8.3. Errors resulting from Labor Reconciliation can usually be attributed to one or more of
   the following causes:
      3.8.3.1. Supervisor or Timekeeper making direct entry of labor in DCPS, after the TAA
      Payroll Cut-off date, bypassing TAA entirely will result in Labor Reconciliation Errors
      because TAA has no record of labor transactions to match labor hours paid to employee
      on the same date.
   3.8.3.2. Single Lump-Sum payments or receipts entered directly to DCPS by DFAS
   personnel for such things as Debt Repayment, Incentive Pay, Bonus Pay, Retirement, Leave
   Payouts etc. will result in Errors because TAA has no record of most lump-sum payments.
   3.8.3.3. Correcting Entries made directly to DCPS by DFAS personnel for missing payroll
   adjustments such as Shift Differential, Hourly Wage/Grade changes, Holiday/Sunday Pay,
   Leave, Overtime, Personnel additions/deletions, or other adjustments not properly entered in
   TAA also result in Reconciliation Errors. See local FZRD guidance for detailed correction
   instructions regarding DIFMS Labor Reconciliation procedures.

3.9. Correcting Labor Errors
   3.9.1. The application of DIFMS edit and validation criterion upon labor data from the TAA
   yields both un-allocated and un-reconciled transactions on a daily basis. Despite TAA
   capability to process and forward corrections through the DLCP, not all errors are corrected
   prior to DIFMS labor processing. The validation process is one of the ways DIFMS confirms
   incoming data. However, if the data cannot be confirmed or validated, DIFMS rejects the
   labor transactions as either un-allocated or un-reconciled (7310-541 report). Labor
   transactions must be charged to applicable and open job numbers and shops. When DIFMS
   labor transactions are un-allocated, charges are suspended because the job or shop does not
   meet the JON/Shop validation criteria. Correcting un-allocated errors ensures that all
   charges are assigned to applicable jobs and shops. Also, correction of un-reconciled, as well
   as un-allocated labor must be done in order to maintain accurate payroll records.
   Unallocated labor errors should be corrected within the current pay period. Once un-
   allocated errors have been corrected, verify the corrections initiated are not rejected by
   DIFMS (7310-531 report). (Introduce the Labor Errors here.)
       3.9.1.1. Unallocated labor transactions are corrected via mass by creating a ms645d02
       file or the MS143P. Individual corrections can be made on the DIFMS Update Screen
       MS143P “Labor Job Order Number Shop Error Correction Update”. Unallocated errors
       are those transactions that fail the job/shop validation process. These errors must be
       identified and corrected in order to assign the labor costs incurred to the correct JON and
       Shop. Correcting un-allocated errors is done regularly.
   3.9.2. The following are key reasons why transactions fail the job/shop validation in DIFMS
   processing:
       3.9.2.1. The shop is not valid or authorized
       3.9.2.2. The job has closed since the previous labor cycle (JOST keeps JONs open for 30
       days after G004L closure date)
3.9.2.3. Restriction codes are invalid
       3.9.2.4. JON does not exist on the database
       3.9.2.5. The transaction causes customer funds to be exceeded
       3.9.2.6. No bill level on JON
       3.9.2.7. The restriction code position 1 is invalid
   3.9.3. Using Section I of the DIFMS Report 7310-541, locate the un-allocated transaction by
   error serial number, or use the correct JON or Shop in order to make a mass un-allocated
   transaction. Mass un-allocated errors are generated when several transactions using the same
   faulty JON or Shop are rejected. Correction of these un-allocated transactions does not
   require a specific error serial number. It does however require the correct data to replace the
   invalid JON or Shop. Errors of the mass type are corrected using the first five lines of
   DIFMS Update Screen MS143P. Correction of un-allocated errors by specific error serial
   number utilizes only the last two lines of the screen.
   3.9.4. Section II of DIFMS Report 7310-541 shows information needed to identify and
   correct un-reconciled labor transactions. Use portions of this report to identify un-reconciled
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     79


  errors and correct them through the DIFMS Update Screen MS146P “Multi-Line Job/Shop
  Error Corrections”. Un-reconciled errors occur during the DIFMS automated labor
  reconciliation process and represent unaccounted for time. In other words, un-reconciled
  errors occur when the total labor hours do not match to the total hours paid as recorded by
  payroll (e.g., DCPS).
     3.9.4.1. Although the DIFMS reconciliation process automatically adjusts for labor
     dollar variances (up to $1 in value to an overhead adjustment JON), discrepancies in
     hours must be researched and corrected accordingly. During the reconciliation process,
     certain transactions are rejected when a JON cannot be assigned. Un-reconciled labor
     transactions are corrected fully or partially via DIFMS Update Screen MS146P.
     Determine whether full correction or partial correction is needed for each transaction.
     Identify the correct data from the source documentation provided by the Maintenance
     Group and/or RCC manager.
     3.9.4.2. It is sometimes necessary to make corrections with zero hours (and non-zero
     dollars) if the error occurred against a transaction which had been generated as a “rate
     adjustment” by the DIFMS Program MS236P “Labor/Payroll Reconciliation”. Zero
     hours corrections can be made using the DIFMS Update Screen MS146P.
  3.9.5. Errors may occur in the TAA, DIFMS, DCPS, and DDS processes. When DIFMS
  labor transactions are un-allocated, charges are suspended because the job or shop does not
  meet the JON/Shop validation criteria. Correcting un-allocated errors ensures that all
  charges are assigned to applicable jobs and shops.
     3.9.5.1. Errors showing 900154A in JON field are because the 30 pos JON field (DCPS)
     is not populated, not where CEC starts with 'U' (indicators below). SSN shows up in
     “Enumber” field and/or transaction date shows as last day of the pay period for PP
     reconciling or previous PP.
  3.9.6. Here are some preventive measures and other ideas:
     3.9.6.1. Keep everything in TAA current and accurate (i.e., new employees, deleted
     employees, promotions, downgrades, pay step increases, wage rates, invalid RCCs, and
     EMP XREF file). New employees should be added on their first day so they will receive
     employee numbers and not being tracked by their Social Security number (SSN).
     3.9.6.2. Manual inputs into DCPS need to have 30 position JON field (Process needs to
     be documented.
     3.9.6.3. The amounts for un-reconciled labor transactions can the corrected through the
     DIFMS Update Screen MS143P.
     3.9.6.4. When mass allocation of un-reconciled errors are to be processed, an excel
     spreadsheet format can be created with the JON, Shop, Error Number, WBS-Code to be
     compiled and ran into DIFMS as a batch error correction process utilizing the DIFMS
     Run Stream MS645J. (The MS645J will not allow the cost element code to be changed.)
     The batch process will allow multiple errors to be corrected especially if the transactions
     involve back pay and need to be corrected to a standing JON. Prior pay period
     adjustments need to have the coordination of Cost Accounting.3.9.2.6. The following
     table can be used for understanding and correcting the errors.

                                           correct JON using the 228.
   3.10.1. The MS227J run stream recycles the errors. Details can be found on DIFMS
   Programs MS227P “Cyclic Input of Labor Data” and MS347P “Labor Validation Errors”.
      3.10.1.1. The DIFMS Program MS227P "Process Cyclic Labor Data" reads the edited
      labor data and assigns premium codes, assigns indirect job order numbers based on
      current/permanent shops, computes labor amounts, and creates supplemental labor
      records. A total of the regular hours is calculated and compared to the computed total
      hours. The computed total hours are calculated using the number of days and number of
      employees. The difference between the actual hours and computed hours must be within
      the allowable variance. If the difference is more than the allowable variance (+/-,) then
      the processing of DIFMS Program MS227P stops. Hours for labor are totaled by type of
      labor and program type. The amounts are reported on the DIFMS Report 7310-516
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     81


     “Total Labor Controls”. The screen related to this report is DIFMS Update Screen
     MS193P “Variance Components Update”.
     3.10.1.2. If the hours are within the allowable variance, then an edit and validation is
     done on selected data. The labor records that pass edit and validation are written to files
     MS227D01 (Regular Labor) and MS227D04 (Allocated Standard Cost). The labor
     records with a transaction date greater than the labor end date are written to files
     MS227D02 (Regular Labor) and MS227D06 (Allocated Standard Cost) as rejections.
     After research has been completed and corrections made, these files then go into next run
     of MS227J for processing.
     3.10.1.3. Labor records that don't pass the edit criteria are written to the DIFMS Report
     7310-517 "DIFMS Labor Validation Errors Report", 7310-525 "DIFMS Labor Detail
     Transactions Report", 7310-541 "DIFMS Outstanding Unallocated Labor Report", and
     the 7310-543 "DIFMS Batch Unallocated Labor Report". Correction of errors on the
     DIFMS Report 7310-517 is through the TAA error correction process to include the
     DLCP. . The 7310-525 report will reflect the amount of labor hours and dollars
     involved. The 7310-541 report will reflect the labor error count (cumulative) needing
     correction. The 7310-543 report reflects the general overhead errors.
         3.10.1.3.1. To correct labor errors, rejected labor transactions are resolved
         individually using the MS143P or MS146P screens. Corrections can be processed in
         a bulk file drop of the MS645D01 file. The MS228D02 file is used to correct labor
         errors relating to leave, new hires, etc. The primary error conditioninclude ADD
         0591, 0834, 0835, 1304, 1706, 2033, 2551, 2578, 2592, 3351, 3354, 3558, 4275,
         1704, and 3829.
         3.10.1.3.2. If the error corrections need to be reviewed, the 7310-531 "DIFMS Labor
         Detail Posting Labor Distribution Report" will reflect the details. Errors that fail
         correction appear on the following day's error correction report (7310-525 as an
         example). This is similar to the DIFMS Report 7310-541 "DIFMS Outstanding
         Unallocated Labor Report" which retains the cumulative errors. Error records will
         remain on the reports until resolved.
  3.10.2. Supervisor/Timekeeper Procedures for Correcting Unallocated Labor Errors during
  the pay period can be found in the TAA Manual. Once the pay period has ended, errors can
  no longer be corrected in TAA and must be worked by the division labor analyst in DIFMS.
  The unallocated labor errors at this point are passed to DIFMS for correction. Unallocated
  labor cost cannot be accurately reflected in DIFMS until information is received from the
  supervisor or timekeeper to correct the error. To correct these unaccounted errors in DIFMS,
  supervisors or timekeepers must provide the necessary labor information to their division
  labor analyst for correction. If the production Job Order Number (JON), shop, and error
  details are not provided to the division labor analyst, actual expended time is not accurately
  reflected nor passed on to downstream systems.

4.1. Introduction
   4.1.1. NIMMS is the material management system within the DMAPS suite of software. It
   performs numerous functions including: validates requests passed through the Automated
   Bill of Material (ABOM) system; creates due-in to obligate the funds and to cost the material
   at the time of receipt; issues material on hand from inventory to the Job Order Number (JON)
   and Resource Control Center (RCC) and generates an issue document for DIFMS to process;
   values the depot maintenance inventory using the weighted average pricing method; and
   provides an independent inventory system for depot maintenance. NIMMS automatically
   updates DIFMS with current material information. Most DIFMS material errors are
   corrected in NIMMS. Consult the ABOM and NIMMS user manuals for procedures on
   making corrections and additional details on system capabilities. The current DFAS I&T
   Link is https://t6800.csd.disa.mil/index.php. Information from NIMMS is interfaced with
   legacy supply and maintenance systems.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                    83

   4.1.2. All screens and programs for DIFMS and NIMMS are identified with a six-digit code
   with ‘M’ as the first position, system designator as second position (‘S’-DIFMS, ‘N’-
   NIMMS), number of the screen or process as positions three through five, and ‘P’ as the last
   position. For DIFMS, screen numbers stating with ‘0’ are inquiries and with ‘1’ or ‘7’ are

   for update. Report numbering for DIFMS begins with ‘7310-’, followed by a three-digit
   number. Numbers in the‘400’ series are for material. Report numbering for NIMMS begins
   with ‘MN’ followed by the program number generating the report, then by ‘R’ and then a
   two-digit report number starting with ‘01’.
   4.1.3. Material control is covered under Air Force Materiel Command Instruction (AFMCI)
   21-130, Equipment Maintenance Material Control. This chapter covers policy and
   procedures related to financial processing for material and DLA. It is imperative that all
   transactions be validated before being processed. The financial well-being of depot
   maintenance, is dependent on the accuracy of these material transactions, therefore the
   importance of valid data cannot be over-emphasized.

4.2. Material Transactions
   4.2.1. Process for ordering depot supply material allows the user to enter the request in
   ABOM or other systems. After clearing edits, the order passes to NIMMS where a due
   record is established and reflected in DIFMS, and if no inventory is available in the NIMMS
   material Navy Industrial Fund (NIF) stores, the order passes to G402A for processing in the
   materiel systems. Requisition status passes from D035K to NIMMS and ABOM.
   4.2.2. DIFMS Program MS676P “Calculate Material Commitment and Obligation” stores
   the Transaction-Date (DT_TRANSTN) on Material-Due (NIMMS_MAT_DUE) records
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     85


   where the date is not present. This allows the DIFMS Report 7310-620 “Encumbrance
   Aging” to accurately age material commitments and obligations on all material due records.
   4.2.3. Physical receipt of material from depot supply necessitates a receipt transaction. For
   receipts from depot supply, enter a receipt transaction in NIMMS to clear the due in record
   and establish an accounts payable record in DIFMS. The payable record in DIFMS is
   matched at the transaction level when the bill is received.
   4.2.4. Physical receipt of material from depot supply requires a receipt transaction entry in
   NIMMS. Except for receipts of MSD material by the CSAG, receipt transactions entered
   into NIMMS will clear the due in record and will establish an accounts payable record in
   DIFMS. The payable record in DIFMS is matched at the transaction level when the bill is
   received. Receipt transactions entered into NIMMS for MSD material received by the CSAG
   will clear the due in record and will record a gain offset by a cost transaction.
   4.2.5. Issue of material whether from Specific Requirements Inventory (SRI) store or depot
   maintenance inventory (NIF store) creates an expense transaction on the JON related to the
   due. “Free issue” material is accounted for in NIMMS in a DMI store but is not an expense
   to the Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group (CSAG).
   4.2.6. The process for ordering Base Supply material (i.e., hazardous material, protective
   gear, etc.) is for the user to enter the request in AF Integrated Logistics System – Supply
   (ILS-S), which is passed through ABOM to NIMMS. After clearing edits, the order passes to
   NIMMS where a due record, receipt and issue is established and reflected in DIFMS.
   4.2.7. Other material transactions such as IPV, local manufacture, local purchase,
   commercial buys, and fuel are entered directly to NIMMS to receipt under the NIMMS
   Process MN412P or other “Batch Establishments”.

4.3. Material Distribution
   4.3.1. Direct material expensing occurs through material issues to or turn-ins from direct
   JONs on the production floor. Increases (debits) to direct material expense originate from
   issues of direct material from supply, issues from a NIMMS inventory store, or reversals of
   turn-ins. Decreases (credits) to direct material expense occur from turn-ins or reversals of
   issues. Direct material expense is recorded in United States Standard General Ledger
   (USSGL) Account 610000W2, Supplies, and Materials - Direct. Daily updates to this
   account are shown on the DIFMS Report 7310-424 “Weekly Material Expenditures
   Summary by Expense Count”. This report summarizes direct expense at the shop level.
   Details by shop and requisition are displayed on the DIFMS Report 7310-421 “Weekly
   Material Expenditures by Cost Center”.
   4.3.2. Production Overhead expensing occurs through material issues to or turn-ins from
   production overhead ‘X’ JONs. This includes bench stock, clothing, hazardous material,
   medical supplies, inventory adjustments, non-credit returns, and write-offs. Increases
   (debits) to indirect material expense originate from issues of indirect material from supply or
   reversals of turn-ins. Decreases (credits) to indirect material expense occur from turn-ins or
   reversals of issues. Indirect material expense is recorded in USSGL account 610000W3,
   Supplies and Materials - Production. Updates to this account are shown on DIFMS Report
   7310-424, “Weekly Material Expenditures Summary by Expense Count”. This report
   summarizes indirect expense at the JON level. Details by shop and requisition are displayed
   on DIFMS Report 7310-421, “Weekly Material Expenditures by Cost Center”. Materials
   ordered in support of Cost Class IV (PMEL / S-JONs) are recorded in DIFMS as production
   overhead expense in USSGL account 610000W3, Supplies and Materials - Production.
   4.3.3. General and Administrative (G&A) expensing occurs through issuing of material to
   overhead ‘Y’ JONs. This includes types of expenses in support of all shops, such as office
   supplies and equipment. Increases (debits) to indirect material expense originate from issues
   ofindirect material from supply or reversals of turn-ins. Decreases (credits) to indirect
   material expense occur from turn-ins or reversals of issues. Indirect material expense is
   recorded in USSGL account 610000W4, Supplies and Materials - General. Updates to this
   account are shown on DIFMS Report 7310-424 Add report name. This report summarizes
   indirect expense at the JON level. Details by shop and requisition are displayed on DIFMS
   Report 7310-421 “Weekly Material Expenditures by Cost Center”. Reference the action
   status code posting rules in the NIMMS user manual, Appendix L, Status Codes. The current
   DFAS I&T Link is
   4.3.4. Accounting for Fuel “BSME”
      4.3.4.1. ‘BSME’ is governed by Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). DLA is now
      providing DFAS with detailed IPAC billings for all ‘BSME’ billings. DFAS provides
      billing information to each ALC for input into DIFMS. The Accounts Payable (A/P)
      records are created based on receipting the fuel into NIMMS. If no detailed receipt has
      been input into NIMMS, the billing transactions will error out, as a MIT, and the error
      must be cleared.
      4.3.4.2. If needed, each ALC determines the number of MORD(s) to be created at the
      beginning of each FY. An anticipated annual fuel buy amount is determined for each
      JON and shop (e.g., RCC) stated on the MORDs.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     87


         4.3.4.2.1. If needed each ALC inputs the MORDs commitment and obligation into
         NIMMS MN012P “Establishment”, and MN021P ”Material Due Update”. The
         obligation is input into GAFS-BL/BQ with a separate Accounting Classification
         Reference Number (ACRN) for each line of accounting on the MORD.
         4.3.4.2.2. “BSME” sends an obligation interface file to GAFS/BL monthly with
         Balance      Identification  (Bal-ID)     of     ‘U’,    document        identifier
         ‘FP20xxXXXXXXXX(X)’, (with xx representing the ALC SRAN) under Processing
         Center (PC) ‘G’. “BSME” sends IPAC billings to GAFS/BL for recording the
         disbursement. The IPAC summary and detailed billing records are zero balanced in
         the NBQG00 program. When the IPAC bill is scheduled for processing, the
         disbursements liquidate the Bal-ID of ‘U’, and increase expenses in GAFS/BL.
         Expenses are recorded in GAFS/BL with an ‘I’ in record position 49, for the end of
         month reporting in the DD Form 1400, Statement of Inter-Fund Transactions, to the
         Treasury.
         4.3.4.2.3. When the IPAC bill has been processed, the DFAS General Ledger
         Account prepares a Journal Voucher (JV) for the amounts of the payments processed.
         This JV is posted in DTIM to GAFS/BL and on to DIFMS. Record a reversal in
         GAFS/BL under PC ‘G’ – a credit or debit amount as applicable. Record a
         disbursement/collection, as applicable, against the MORDs that were established in
         GAFS/BL. The JV for the disbursement/collection to GAFS/BL is at the JON and
         shop (RCC) applicable.
         4.3.4.2.4. When the obligation mod is in NIMMS, ALC records the receipt amount
         via NIMMS Update Screen MN113P “Purchase Receipts” for the payment amounts
         for each MORD. This receipting action in NIMMS generates an accounts payable in
         DIFMS.
         4.3.4.2.5. Each ALC monitors the remaining value of the obligation. If the payment
         amounts exceed the remaining value established for the MORD, then the MORD
         must be increased in ABSS.
  4.3.5. Industrial Prime Vendor
     4.3.5.1. Air Force is currently receiving a summary billing line. DLA is now sending
     "detailed" IPAC billings for spot buys. As with 'BSME', DFAS must process the detailed
     billings into the accountable system; also, if the due record is not established in NIMMS,
     the billings reject when processed into DIFMS and cost accounting must correct the
     transactions. Note: Reference AFMCI 21-130, Section 2J, Indirect and Bench Stock
     Material Control and Support.
     4.3.5.2. Detail-level recording of transactions for bench stock is cost prohibitive, record
     transactions in NIMMS at summary level. This requires no change in process by either
     DLA or the IPV contractor. Material MORDs for IPV should be recorded in NIMMS
     rather than DIFMS. By recording IPV in NIMMS, rather than DIFMS, the cost is
     identified as material rather than business operations. This also results in material costs
     being reported to DDS as material rather than “contractual other”.
     4.3.5.3. The following process can be used to record either summary IPV transactions or
     detailed IPV spot-buy transactions. Currently, spot buys are included in the summary
 88                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      IPV transactions and should be cost transferred to the appropriate direct JON/Shop in
      DIFMS using DIFMS Update Screen MS144P “Cost Adjustment Update”. For all IPV
      transactions, users manually enter transactions in NIMMS Screens MN012P
      “Establishment”, MN021P “Material Due”, and MN113P “Purchase Receipts”. The sites
      determine organizations and skills responsible for coordinating with the IPV and making
      required inputs to NIMMS.
      4.3.5.4. To record the commitment/obligation, the user transacts a material due record
      establishment transaction using NIMMS Screen MN012P and MN021P. This transaction
      creates or updates the database’s Material Due Record that is used by both NIMMS and
      DIFMS. Additionally, credit bills must be manually adjusted on the MN021P.
      4.3.5.5. To record the receipt, the user transacts a receipt using NIMMS Screen
      MN113P. This transaction creates financial material information records for the receipt,
      which is updated into DIFMS. Receipts may be posted when the invoices are received.
      4.3.5.6. As a result of transacting the NIMMS receipt, a requisition status database
      record is created to record the A/P transaction. This requisition status record is linked to
      the material due record. Required minimal information within the A/P detail record
      includes document number (in prescribed format), unit of issue, quantity issued, and
      receipted price. This is minimal information required to accomplish document matching
      and compatibility with the billing process.
   4.3.6. Government-Wide Purchase Card for Material can be used. Each AF IMT 4009 must
   have an unique Line of Accounting cost code. The AFI 64-117 documents the GPC use
   requirements.
      4.3.6.1. The GPC is primarily used for indirect material. When the GPC is used for
      direct material, Cost Accounting needs to do a manual “cost transfer”. The cost transfer
      process is used to charge the purchases on the bankcard statement and payment to a direct
      or other indirect JON. If there are items that should be direct charges within the invoiced
      amount, the card holder or certifying official should prepare a cost transfer document to
      be input to DIFMS Update Screen MS144P “Cost Adjustment” for the amount of the
      charges. This transfer document would show the direct and/or indirect JON and amount
      for each purchase, and a credit to the JON, which is stated on the bankcard obligation
      document.
          4.3.6.1.1. Record material GPC buys in NIMMS and GAFS/BL. The cost code on
          the material summary record should be coded with an ‘MU’ rather than a ‘SU’, which
          is used for the service purchases. Separate cards are required for material and
          services purchases. The commitment and obligation for cost codes coded with ‘MU’
          must be directly input into the NIMMS screens. The ‘MU’ commitment and
          obligations transactions are not passed from GAFS/BL to DIFMS, but are manually
          input to NIMMS. Each ALC is responsible for recording these receipts (equal to the
          summary monthly payment) in NIMMS via the MN113P. The receipt creates an A/P
          in DIFMS, which is liquidated by the cash payment.
4.4. Material Inventory
   4.4.1. Physical inventory quantities and store price are maintained in NIMMS and financial
   values of inventory in DIFMS. Inventory Adjustments can increase or decrease the physical
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                       89


  inventory value. NIMMS inventory valuation is based on weighted moving average for each
  NIIN      (see     NIMMS       user     guide,    Appendix      W      at     this    site:
  https://t6800.csd.disa.mil/index.php ) DIFMS accounts for inventory used by the Air Force:
  Material and Supplies – Active (NIF Stores), Direct Material (SRI Store), and Government
  Furnished Material (unfunded) (DMI Store). Reference AFMCI 21-130 for material
  management of these inventory types.
     4.4.2.1. Air Force: Material and Supplies – Active (NIF Stores). Material is placed
     in CSAG owned NIF stores when required for production. Inventories should be kept to
     the minimum required for production. General ledger account 151100A1, Material and
     Supplies-Active, is used to track the inventory values in DIFMS. The value of the
     account reflects the aggregate of all the NIF, Awaiting Parts (AWP), Local
     Manufacturing, Floating Stock and Spares, and Reconciliation stores.
     4.4.2.2. Direct Material (SRI Store). USSGL account 151100A2, Operating Material
     and Supplies Held for Use - Direct Materials, is used to track the inventory values in
     DIFMS. At any point in time, the value of this account must be zero because inventory is
     not stored in this category. Any inventory received is simultaneously issued (e.g., direct-
     line issue or turn-in). This material can be issued to any type of material JON, direct or
     indirect. DIFMS Reports 7310-421 “Weekly Material Expenditures by Cost Center” and
     7310-424 “Weekly Material Expenditures Summary by Expense Account” provide a list
     of issues and turn-ins to the store. DIFMS Report 7310-430 “Detail Material Receipt
     Transactions” provides a list of receipts into NIMMS inventory and turn-ins to supply out
     of the NIMMS inventory by NIMMS code, inventory type, and requisition sequence.
     4.4.2.3. Government Furnished Material. USSGL accounts 902200, Government
     Furnished Material, and 942200, Direct Material Government Furnished Material, are
     used to track the inventory values in DIFMS. GFM items are not paid for by depot
     maintenance, such as kits, and are tracked as unfunded material in DIFMS.
  4.4.3. Inventory adjustments or balance changes are generated due to NIMMS physical
  inventory counts, price revisions and non-credit turn-ins. DIFMS Program MS281P, Prepare
  Inventory Adjustment Distribution, updates the material requisition status file and incurs
  allowances resulting from inventory adjustments. DIFMS Report 7310-431 “Detail Inventory
  Adjustments” reflects various transactions generated by the NIMMS to affect adjustments or
  balance changes to inventory. If difference is positive, posting is Debit (DR); if difference is
  negative, posting is a Credit (CR).
     4.4.3.1. Inventory adjustments generate gains and losses to USSGL account 610000W3,
     Production Overhead, under JON ‘X56940414000’. The value of these adjustments is
     based on the number of items adjusted multiplied by the current store unit prices.
     Associated NIMMS codes are ‘D2’/’M2’, ‘D4’/’M4’, and ‘D8’/’M8’.
     4.4.3.2. Price revisions generate financial gains and losses to USSGL account
     610000W3, Production Overhead, under JON ‘X56950414000’. The value of these
     adjustments is based on the difference in price multiplied by the number of assets in the
     inventory for a given NIIN. Associated NIMMS codes are ‘E1’/’N1’ and ‘E2’/’N2’.
     4.4.3.3. Non-credit turn-ins generate losses to USSGL account 610000W3, Production
     Overhead, under JON ‘X56510414000’. Associated NIMMS codes are ‘L1’/’L2’/’L3’.
90                                                               AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


  4.4.4. Materials received after the JON has closed or unacceptable items (such as invalid
  substitute NIIN) are retained in the recon store pending action. In most cases, the asset is
  physically issued but has not been properly accounted for financially. Therefore, the
  corrective action is generally to process an issue to a valid JON. If material in the recon store
  cannot be issued to an open JON, an inventory loss should be processed using the NIMMS
  Inquiry Screen MN054P. DIFMS Report 7310-433 “Financial Inventory Control Ledger” is
  the financial status of the NIMMS store records. Each transaction that increased or
  decreased the inventory balances during the week appears on this report. The same
  transactions appear on DIFMS Reports 7310-421 “Weekly Material Expenditures by Job
  Order”, 7310-430 “Detail Material Receipt Transaction Report” and 7310-431 “Detail
  Inventory Adjustments”. The 7310-433 report is a subsidiary ledger for USSGL accounts
  151100A1 (Materials and Supplies - Active), 151100A2 (Direct Material), 902100
  (Customer Furnished Material) and 902200 (Government Furnished Material). This
  information can also be viewed on the NIMMS Screen MN099P “Store Balances by Store”.
  4.4.5. Financial procedures for AWP
     4.4.5.1. When the asset goes into AWP, there’s initially no financial impact.
     Wholesale/Retail Receiving/Shipping (WRRS-D035K) is the accountable system for the
     management of AWP. ABOM is used as the input system for parts ordering. D035K
     links the end item and component piece parts under program control (electronically) and
     passes AWP updates to NIMMS/ABOM. This allows for automatic AWP reporting and
     management in the D035K and NIMMS/ABOM. Production shops must provide the end
     item document number (EIDN), Standard Reporting Designator (SRD), and Required
     Delivery Date (RDD) with all requests made through ABOM so that the D035K can link
     the end item and component/piece-parts internally. When ordering parts for end items in
     work, the user inputs all initial orders through ABOM using the ‘6N’ advice code and
     appropriate priority. These orders automatically declare an AWP condition, create a
     backorder if the part is not available from base stock, and ensure visibility of all depot
     AWP items.
     4.4.5.2. When items in organic depot maintenance awaiting parts are determined to be
     fully supportable (i.e., all parts have been received), production control personnel
     determine whether repair of the item continues to be required. If repair continues to be
     required, production control re-inducts the item on the in-work JON from which the item
     was moved to AWP status. If that JON has been closed, production control re-inducts the
     item on a new, funded JON.
     4.4.5.3. If the original JON has been closed, re-induct the item on a new, funded JON
     using a new End Item Document Number (EIDN) and Work Control Document (WCD)
     from the Inventory Tracking System (ITS-G337). This action causes flow day tracking to
     be split between the old and new JON for the AWP items re-inducted on a new JON.
     Overall, the impact should be minimal since AWP occurs for less than 10% of the
     repaired items and items needing to be re-inducted on a new JON are a portion of that
     total. In addition, a change has been proposed for G337 to link the old EIDN/WCD to
     the new EIDN/WCD for AWP items. The cost and schedule for this redesign and related
     changes to TAA and DDS will likely results in a lengthy time for the changes can be
     implemented. Thus, in the interim, close the EIDN/WCD against the old JON and move
     on.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                      91


   4.4.6. Items Found on Base (FOB) should be accounted for as indirect G&A and either
   turned in for credit or issued to the floor.
   4.4.7. Credit returns are done at current Air Force catalog prices. This is the current market
   value of the asset. Most returns are processed within a few weeks of purchase and market
   price fluctuations have a minimum impact on variable costs.
   4.4.8. Maintenance responsibilities for Non-Equipment Authorization Inventory Data
   (EAID) Mockup Equipment at each ALC includes being responsible for the overhaul of
   communication, radar, and similar systems has a normal requirement to assemble and
   maintain mockups. These non-EAID mockups are authorized by the responsible Item
   Manager/System Manager (IM/SM) for use by the ALC to simulate field conditions under
   which the total system operates. Black box components repaired under Management of
   Items Subject to Repair (MISTR) on a project directive for the system are plugged into their
   normal place in the system to determine their serviceability. When the ALC needs to
   perform maintenance on the mockup components, the following criteria apply to costing for
   this service.
      4.4.8.1. Organic depot maintenance absorbs repair requirements as a cost class IV charge
      (reference Chapter 2 of the financial policies and procedures). These components were
      received for use as a serviceable item and depot maintenance has responsibility to
      maintain this status.
      4.4.8.2. Modification and development of technical data when directed by the IM/SM
      and accomplished by the TRC on mockup components are authorized and costed as direct
      product work. The responsible IM/SM must provide an AFMC IMT 206 funded on a
      Type ‘6’ Purchase Order (PO) to cover the costs of the modification. These costs are
      authorized separately from any repair done in conjunction with a modification.
   4.4.9. Procedures for Scrap. During the depot maintenance production process, scrap is
   generated from material purchased by organic depot maintenance. This scrap is turned in to
   the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO). A DD Form 1348-1A, DoD
   Single Line Item Release/Receipt Document is prepared by personnel in organic depot
   maintenance and accompanies the scrap. AFMCI 21-130 has procedures for handling scrap.
4.5. Material Error Processing
   4.5.1. Typically, un-allocated transactions are sent back to NIMMS for correction.
   Occasionally, transactions may appear on reports indicating jobs and/or shops are invalid.
   Also, requisition numbers may be entered incorrectly, and need to be corrected. These can
   affect four USSGL accounts: 1990.0A Unallocated Material Expenditures; 9621.00
   Unfunded Unallocated Costs – Customer Furnished Material; 9622.00 Unfunded Unallocated
   Costs – Government Furnished Material; 1511.00B1 Operating Material and Supplies Held
   for Use - Material In-Transit Government. DIFMS Report 7310-413 is for unallocated
   material expenditures.
   4.5.2. Unallocated material errors. Unallocated material errors occur when material is
   expensed against an invalid JON and/or shop. Since NIMMS uses the same JON/shop
   validation as DIFMS, these errors are very rare.
92                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


     4.5.2.1. DIFMS Report 7310-413 “Unallocated Material Expenditures” identifies
     corrective action needed on Job Order Number/Shop errors presently pending corrective
     action.
     4.5.2.2. DIFMS Report 7310-415 “Weekly Unallocated Material Expenditures” covers
     un-allocated material expenditures and is a subsidiary for USSGL accounts 1990.00B
     (Unallocated Material Expenditures), 9621.00 (Unidentified Costs – Customer Furnished
     Material) and 9622.00 (Unidentified Costs – Government Furnished Material). This
     report provides a subsidiary ledger for the Unallocated Material Accounts and must be
     zero balance at the end of a fiscal year.
     4.5.2.3. Unallocated material errors are corrected using DIFMS Update Screen MS141P
     “Material Jon Shop Error Correction”. Use this screen both to relieve USSGL accounts
     1990.00B, 9621.00, and 9622.00 and to assign a valid Job Order Number/Shop to the
     material expenditure transaction.
     4.5.2.4. DIFMS Report 7310-416 “Material Job/Shop Error Correction Failures” lists
     material records still un-allocated after an attempt to correct a Job Order Number/Shop
     error shown on 7310-413 or 7310-415.
  4.5.3. There may be situations where bills and receipts do not match. DIFMS screens allow
  write-off and override of mismatches, applying the charges to overhead. This should only be
  done after thorough research is completed and it is determined that the bill and receipt cannot
  be matched. Write-off should be the exception, and the user must obtain approval from the
  Chief of Cost Accounting before entering such transactions. Additionally, the Chief of Cost
  Accounting maintains a history of the quantity and dollar value of write-offs. Refer to the
  materiality criteria Chapter 1.
  4.5.4. Override screens write off to the USSGL account 6100.00W3, which is Production
  Overhead (POH). DIFMS Program MS280P “Material Data” and associated NIMMS Code
  Posting Table allow for inventory adjustment transactions to post to production indirect job
  numbers when the associated system information record job numbers are designated as
  “Production” (Indirect JON Type is ‘P’). Similarly, the DIFMS Program MS270P “Maintain
  and Report Requisition Status” and associated Requisition Status Posting Table allow for
  write-offs, overrides and purchase variances to post to production indirect job numbers when
  the associated System Information Record Job Numbers are designated as “Production”.
     4.5.4.1. Set all material JON(s) on DIFMS Update Screen MS192P to the designated
     POH JONs. This ensures that the user cannot create an incompatibility between these
     JONs and the two standard posting tables used by DIFMS Programs MS270P and
     MS280P. This process assures the General Ledger (USSGL account 6100.00W3) is in
     line with the subsidiary cost summary data.
     4.5.4.2. All open receipt return records are set to a “Completed” (3) status when the
     Accounts Receivable balance reaches zero through a DIFMS Program MS280P
     transaction event. Since the DIFMS Program MS270P does not match credit bills to
     individual receipt returns, and closes the bill record only (unless the entire balance is
     relieved), the remaining receipt return that partially or fully supported the balance that
     was relieved, must be closed. The DIFMS Program MS280P closes all Category ‘B’
     (Receivable) records when a reversal is processed to bring the requisition level balance to
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                    93


     zero. This program not only closes the record that is being reversed, but also closes any
     other “open” receipt return transactions as long as the overall requisition level Accounts
     Receivable balance has reached zero.
     4.5.4.3. The instances/occurrences of material “out of balances” due to internal
     processing of DIFMS program MS280P have been significantly reduced. This not only
     includes general ledger versus subsidiary out of balances, but also Debit/Credit
     imbalances as well. DIFMS Program 280P continues to process when encountering a bad
     combination of NIMMS Codes and Financial Inventory Type Codes and ensures
     compatible NIMMS Codes and Financial Inventory Type Codes are created each time
     either a Daily Valid Material Information (DIFMS_DAILY_VLD_MAT_INFO) or an
     Unallocated Material Expenditure record (DIFMS_UNALCTD_MAT_EXPND) is
     created. This process also ensures that any updates done for these two types of records
     have a compatible NIMMS Code and Financial Inventory Type Code relationship.
     Processing for the DIFMS Material Requisition Status record ensures that ‘Unit Price’,
     ‘Material Info’, and ‘Material Expended’ fields for the bill and material (receipt, etc.)
     contain a positive value.
     4.5.4.4. Write offs and adjustments go to the specific Shop/Cost Center associated with
     the requisition. DIFMS Program MS270P takes material write-offs and overrides to the
     shop associated with the Material-Due record, rather than using the shops from the
     DIFMS_SYS_INFO, under limited conditions. When the write-off or adjustment is to a
     “Production” shop (Cost Center associated with the Shop is a Type ‘P’), the program
     attempts to take the adjustment to the shop from the Material-Due itself. If the shop (or
     associated Cost Center from that Shop) from the Material-Due is not valid, then the
     adjustment is taken to the shop from the DIFMS_SYS_INFO. This condition most
     commonly occurs if an Unmatched Government Bill is being written off (at that point,
     the Shop for the requisition is usually not identified). If the shop from the
     DIFMS_SYS_INFO is a “General” shop, the program continues to use that shop.
     DIFMS Report 7310-461 “Transactions Clearing Requisition Status” totals and displays
     the various combinations of Job/Shop/Contractual Other Code.
  4.5.5. If bills and receipts do not match, the ALC financial, cost accounting, and depot
  supply offices must research and correct. Process Billed Not Received (BNR) corrections
  within the same month as the error was identified and Received Not Billed (RNB) must be
  researched and corrected within 60 days.           Each ALC sets up material JONs
  (‘X56940414000’, ‘X56950414000’, ‘X56510414000’) to capture the costs for mismatched
  transactions, which cannot be corrected. Charge such transactions to this JON so the amount
  and number of un-reconciled items can be tracked. See procedures below for an explanation
  of the process for these unmatched charges.
  4.5.6. DIFMS Report 7310-484 “Aged Unmatched Bills” is capable of sending “zero”
  records to the DIFMS Report 7310-965 for all accounts it is responsible for reporting on
  (including those accounts that would seldom ever reach a zero balance). All material
  subsidiary report programs provide the same capability, including the DIFMS Programs
  MS364P “Report Aged Material Accounts Receivable”, MS384P “Report Work-in-Process
  Other Government Plant”, and MS416P “Report Work-in-Process Contractors”. User sees
  actual out of balances reflected on the DIFMS Report 7310-965 and not “false” errors when
  accounts migrate to a zero subsidiary balance.
94                                                           AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


  4.5.7. Material in Transit (MIT)
     4.5.7.1. Per AFMCI 21-130, the division resource advisor reconciles material issue
     requests/receipts to billing records to ensure all material has been received for which
     maintenance has been billed (WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel provide assistance, as
     needed). This process occurs once a month, and the reconciliation is accomplished by
     reviewing the DIFMS financial material error reports. Center Financial Management
     (FM) organizations shall be notified where it is necessary to correct financial records.
     Records of the monthly review are maintained by the applicable division resource
     advisor.
     4.5.7.2. MIT errors are displayed on DIFMS Report 7310-469 “Aged Material-In-Transit
     – Government” which ages and displays amounts in MIT – Government category. This
     report is a subsidiary ledger for USSGL account 151100B1, OM&S Held for Use -
     Material in Transit - Government.
     4.5.7.3. MIT debit bills generate when a due has been recorded in NIMMS, a bill has
     been received from supply, and no receipt has been processed. Research of MIT debit
     errors begins with use of the DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS061P “Material Requisition
     Status”.     The person researching must determine if material was received.
     Documentation for research includes DD1348-1A (DoD Single Line Item Requisition
     System Document), D035J, Automated Material Tracking System (AMTS-D364), and
     Distribution Standard System (DSS). If research indicates material was received, process
     the receipt using NIMMS Screen MN031P “Receipts”. If research indicates material has
     not been received, request credit is issued from supply through established procedures.
     4.5.7.4. MIT credit bills generate when a due has been recorded in NIMMS, a credit bill
     has been received from supply, and a credit turn-in has not been processed. Use the
     DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS061P “Material Requisition Status” to identify the JON
     associated with the credit. Use DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS036P “Obligation Inquiry by
     Job Order” Option 9 to determine if a turn-in was processed. If a no-credit turn in
     transaction is found on DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS036P, reverse the turn-in and re-
     process as a credit expected turn-in on NIMMS MN045P. If no turn-in transaction is
     found, enter one.
     4.5.7.5. If a MIT error cannot be resolved, request the item be written off through
     DIFMS MS188P “MIT Write-Off Update”.
  4.5.8. Unmatched Government Bill (UGB)
     4.5.8.1. UGB errors are displayed on DIFMS Report 7310-484 “Aged Unmatched Bills”.
     This report is a subsidiary ledger for USSGL account 1511.00C1, OM&S Held for Use -
     Unmatched - Government Material Bills.
     4.5.8.2. Debit UGB errors generate when a bill is received from supply and no due is
     established in NIMMS. Research of UGB errors includes history in FIABS (only shows
     production number, no JON suffix) and G402A (shows complete JON for errors less than
     90 days old). If research indicates the bill is valid, process a due and receipt using
     NIMMS Screen MN012P “Due Establishment”. If research indicates the bill is not valid,
     request credit is issued from supply through established procedures.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     95


     4.5.8.3. Credit UGB errors generate when a credit bill is received from supply and no
     due is established in NIMMS and a credit turn-in has not been processed. Research of
     UGB errors includes history in FIABS (only shows production number, no JON suffix)
     and G402A (shows complete JON for errors less than 90 days old). Once the JON has
     been identified, use DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS036P “Obligation Inquiry by Job Order”
     Option 9 to determine if a turn-in was processed. If a no-credit turn in transaction is
     found on DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS036P, reverse the turn-in and re-process as a credit
     expected turn-in on NIMMS Screen MN045P “Turn-In to Supply”. If no turn-in
     transaction is found, enter one. AFMCI 21-130, Section 65, provides procedures for
     turn-in of material items using NIMMS and ABOM.
     4.5.8.4. If a UGB error cannot be resolved, request the item be written off through
     DIFMS MS102P, Unmatched Material Bill Write-Off.
  4.5.9. Duplicate Bills
     4.5.9.1. Duplicate bills are displayed on DIFMS Report 7310-484 “Aged Unmatched
     Bills”. USSGL account 151100C3, Unmatched Duplicate Bills” is the unmatched
     account to be relieved. If credit is requested for a duplicate bill, USSGL account
     131040A2, Accounts Receivable - Credits Pending from Government Sources, is
     established for the receivable.
     4.5.9.2. Research must determine if the duplicate bill is actually a partial bill missing a
     suffix code or if the bill is truly a duplicate second bill.
     4.5.9.3. If the bill is determined to be valid, receipt the item using NIMMS Screen
     MN031P.
     4.5.9.4. If the bill is determined to be a true duplicate, credit from supply should be
     requested. Use DIFMS Update Screen MS101P “Anticipated Credit” to move the
     duplicate bill when it has been determined that credit is allowed and to establish accounts
     receivable for duplicate bills. Results of the update are shown in DIFMS Report 7310-
     461, Transactions Clearing Requisition Status.
     4.5.9.5. When supply does not allow credit for a duplicate bill, use DIFMS Update
     Screen MS102P “Unmatched Bill Write-Off” to perform the write-off.
  4.5.10. Aged Accounts Payable (receipts no bill)
     4.5.10.1. In general, receipts from NIMMS precede bills from supply because NIMMS
     processes each day and supply bills monthly. When a receipt is aged greater than 30 days
     and no bill from supply has been received, research is required. Aged Accounts DIFMS
     Report 7310-472 “Aged Accounts Payable” displays payable errors and ages and displays
     amounts in accounts payable for government and commercial. This report is a subsidiary
     ledger for USSGL account 211041A, Accounts Payable - Government Agencies
     Material. Errors can be researched through DD1348-1A, DIFMS Inquiry Screen
     MS061P “Material Requisition Status”, and D035J.
     4.5.10.2. If research indicates that the receipt is valid, depot supply needs to be
     contacted.
     4.5.10.3. If research indicates the receipt is not valid, reverse the receipt using NIMMS
     Inquiry Screen MN031P “Receipts”.
96                                                                AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


     4.5.10.4. If research indicates a funded receipt was processed for unfunded material,
     reverse the receipt using NIMMS Screen MN031P, correct the due using NIMMS Screen
     MN012P “Establishment” or change the NIMMS material record, and re-receipt the item
     as unfunded.
     4.5.10.5. If an aged-accounts-payable error cannot be resolved, request the item be
     written off through DIFMS Update Screen MS183P “Material Accounts Payable Write-
     Off”.
  4.5.11. Aged Accounts Receivable (turn-in)
     4.5.11.1. In general, turn-ins from NIMMS to supply precede credit bills from supply
     because NIMMS processes each day and supply bills monthly. When a receipt is aged
     greater than 30 days and no credit bill from supply has been received, research can begin.
     Aged Accounts Receivable errors are displayed on DIFMS Report 7310-478 “Aged
     Material Accounts Receivable” which displays the aged transactions and amounts in
     USSGL account 131041B (AR - Credits Pending from Government Sources). Errors can
     be researched through D035J, DSS, and AMTS.
     4.5.11.2. If research indicates the turn-in is valid, and credit is due, contact depot supply
     for corrective action.
     4.5.11.3. If research indicates the turn-in is valid, but no credit is due, reverse the credit
     turn-in through NIMMS Screen MN045P “Turn-In to Supply” and re-enter as a no-credit
     turn in.
     4.5.11.4. If research indicates the turn-in is invalid, then reverse the turn-in.
     4.5.11.5. If an aged-accounts-receivable error cannot be resolved, request the item be
     written off through DIFMS Update Screen MS182P “Material Accounts Receivable
     Write-Off”.
  4.5.12. Purchase Variances
     4.5.12.1. These errors generate when a bill and a receipt match by quantity but mismatch
     by an amount greater than the allowable purchase variance as established on the DIFMS
     Update Screen MS193P “Variance Components”. Purchase variance errors are displayed
     on DIFMS Report 7310-495 “Material Mismatched”. Note: also the bill appears on
     DIFMS Report 7310-469 “Aged Material-in-Transit - Government” and the receipt on
     DIFMS Report 7310-472 “Aged Accounts Payable” with a requisition status of ‘5’.
     Errors can be researched through DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS061P “Material Requisition
     Status”.
     4.5.12.2. If research indicates the bill is correct, reverse the receipt with the incorrect
     price and reprocess the receipt with the correct price. It may be necessary to update
     NIMMS cataloging information with correct prices.
     4.5.12.3. If research indicates the bill is incorrect, depot supply needs to be contacted.
     4.5.12.4. If the excessive purchase variance cannot be resolved, request the item be
     written off through DIFMS Update Screen MS185P “Excessive Purchase Variance
     Update” with Override (OVR) option. The variance between the bill and receipt is
     charged to production overhead.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                       97


  4.5.13. Mismatches by Quantity
     4.5.13.1. These errors generate when the bill and receipt match by dollar amount but do
     not match by item quantity. The error happens due to incorrect receipt or cataloging
     information, such as U/I changes. Quantity mismatches are displayed on DIFMS 7310-
     495 “Material Mismatched Report”. Also the bill appears on 7310-469 “Aged Material-
     in-Transit - Government” and the receipt on 7310-472 “Aged Accounts Payable” with a
     requisition status of ‘4’. Errors can be researched by determining whether the shop
     received the quantity required through DD1348-1A, AMTS, and DSS.
     4.5.13.2. If research determines the mismatch is a U/I change, update cataloging
     information. If the receipt is in error, use DIFMS Update Screen MS181P “Mismatched”
     to override the mismatch condition. Note: there is no financial impact.
  4.5.14. Mismatches for Number of Receipts and Bills
     4.5.14.1. If there are multiple receipts with one bill, reverse receipts in NIMMS and
     process one receipt to match the bill from supply. It is also possible to use DIFMS
     Update Screen MS189P “Material Requisition Number Correction” to split the bill to
     match the receipts. This screen can also be used to move an “Accounts Receivable” bill
     from one requisition to another. Use of DIFMS Update Screen MS189P for this purpose
     increases the Accounts Receivable balance on the new requisition number and decreases
     the Accounts Receivable balance on the old requisition number. “Receivable” bills occur
     in DIFMS in one of two ways: either a credit bill that partially or fully matches a receipt
     return or a debit bill that has been moved to Accounts Receivable using DIFMS Update
     Screen MS101P “Anticipated Credit”. This screen also allows a single material bill to be
     corrected to more than one new requisition for up to three new requisitions to be
     referenced, as well as allowing for a portion of the bill to remain on the original
     requisition. Capability is also available to perform requisition number corrections on
     bills that are in an “Excessive Purchase Variance” (‘5’) or “Mismatched by Quantity”
     (‘4’) status by having the program not only move the bill to the new requisition, but also
     break it apart from the receipt that it had erroneously been matched with. DIFMS
     Program MS366P “Requisition Number Correction” and associated DIFMS Report 7310-
     416 “Requisition Number Correction” address the multiple Requisition Numbers and
     diverse Quantities and Amounts. All “old” bills are displayed on the left and “new” bills
     on the right.
     4.5.14.2. If there are multiple bills with one receipt, reverse receipt in NIMMS and
     process multiple receipts to match the bills from supply. It is also possible to use DIFMS
     Update Screen MS106P “Supply Warehouse Refusal/ Over-Issue Adjustment” to
     combine the bills to one net bill or to combine a debit and a credit bill or two debit bills,
     which are the result of a supply warehouse refusal. When an issue request for ‘X’-
     quantity of an item is processed and a base movement is generated, D035J sends a bill to
     DIFMS for the entire quantity of the base movement. However, because the quantity
     actually on hand is less than that shown on the item record, a warehouse denial for the
     quantity equal to the shortage is processed. Users should have receipted for what is
     physically received. D035J sends a credit bill for the denied quantity. If the denied
     quantity and the ordered quantity are the same, the records clear one another in DIFMS.
     However, if the quantity denied is less than the quantity ordered (partial denial), use
98                                                                AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


     DIFMS Update Screen MS106P to combine debit and credit bill to net bill, matching the
     receipt. Users can also use this screen to match commercial bills to commercial receipts
     by netting multiple bills together in order to match a single receipt. This eliminates the
     need to input additional “zero batch” cash transactions or do multiple material write-off
     transactions. Users should not process turn-in transactions in NIMMS to reverse the
     shorted quantity from the bill in DIFMS. This processing is illogical in that it is forcing
     the users to process a turn in of stock for material never received. Denial (Supply
     Warehouse Refusal) should not be mimicking D035J transactions.
  4.5.15. Commercial material mismatches include charges being added for freight, excise
  taxes or other sources. These commercial mismatches are sent back to cash. The DIFMS
  MS136P screen is used for this type of transaction. The commercial bills are unmatched
  because there is not a compatible receipt or undelivered order. Applicable USSGL accounts
  are 1310.42B “A/R – Commercial Material”, 151100C3 “OM&S Held for Use – Unmatched
  – Duplicate Government Material Bills” and 211042A1 “Accounts Payable - Unmatched
  Other - Commercial Material Bills”. DIFMS Program MS270P “Maintain and Report
  Material Requisition Status” matches commercial material bills and receipts at the requisition
  level, rather than forcing the items to match exactly at the individual level. This program
  facilitates reconciliation and closure of commercial material requisitions. There is a need to
  do multiple write-offs and overrides, because with the netting process; records are permitted
  to more cleanly close and match off through normal transactions. The process of doing
  write-offs, when necessary, can be narrowed down to a single final write-off transaction
  through DIFMS Update Screen MS741P “Net Accounts Payable/Unmatched Commercial
  Bill Write-Off” for the entire requisition. In addition, the balances carried in the USSGL
  account 211042A1 “Unmatched Commercial Material Bills” should be minimized. Since
  this account is viewed in the Unmatched Disbursement category, this results in
  improvements in the levels being reported by the sites and DFAS.
     4.5.15.1. The DIFMS Program MS270P updates the requisition level “net balance” fields
     for detail level postings it does associated with Debit Unmatched Commercial Bills and
     Debit Commercial Accounts Payable and maintains aging dates at that level. Credit
     Unmatched Commercial Bill balances and Reverse Receipt payable balances (for Receipt
     reversals that do not match with Receipts) remain at the detail line item level. Credit
     Commercial Bills only match Debit Unmatched Commercial Bills at the detail level or
     Accounts Receivable at the requisition level. For all other cases (i.e. exact matches) the
     program matches individual debit bills/receipts, debit bills/credit bills, and
     receipts/receipt reversals at the detail level. The program also updates the corresponding
     requisition level “net balance” fields as it posts. At the end of the processing, the
     program performs a “netting” process, which net balances of “Open” records for the first
     time or “reverse net” items that had previously been netted and have had detail level
     matches occur within the current cycle. The “Netting” and “Reverse Netting” events are
     sent to the DIFMS Report 7310-461 “Transactions Clearing Requisition Status” and are
     included within the summary “MU” Journal Voucher.
     4.5.15.2. The overall result of the netting in DIFMS Process MS270P is that Debit
     Commercial Bills and positive Commercial Receipts that do not get a clean detail match
     remain in an “Open” status and the account balances are “netted together” at the
     requisition level. If there is a dollar surplus of receipts, the requisition balance is carried
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                        99


     in USSGL account 211042B1 “Accounts Payable Commercial Material”; if there is a
     dollar surplus of bills, the requisition balance is carried in USSGL account 211042A1. In
     cases where there are not clean detail matches, but the net balances are zero (for example,
     two bills totaling $20 and one receipt equaling $20) at the requisition level, the remaining
     “open” records is set a to “Completed” status. Although the program is not consciously
     matching multiple bills/receipts together, the net result appears as if it is when the overall
     net requisition balance goes to zero. The two “net Aging” fields are also updated, and the
     requisition carries the earliest date that a record appeared in the particular category.
     4.5.15.3. DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS061P “Material Requisition Status Inquiry” includes
     requisition-level Commercial Accounts Payable Net Balance to Type Response ‘2’
     (Receipts), the requisition-level Unmatched Commercial Bills Net Balance to Type
     Response ‘3’ (Bills), and both “net balance” fields to Type Response ‘5’ (All Records)
     including the accounts receivable balance. Type Response ‘1’ (Undelivered Orders) also
     has a number of Material Due and Purchase Order level fields in the top portion of the
     screen. This includes the Record-Name (‘U’ series), CON, Store-Code, Shop, Financial-
     Inventory-Type, Purge-Key and (PON related) Call-Order, ACRN, CLIN and SLIN. In
     addition, the “actual” Quantity-Due and Quantity-Received fields are on the screen and
     the existing “End of Cycle” values for these fields are labeled as such. This information
     makes the Option ‘1’ comprehensive and eliminates the need for the user to run ad-hoc
     database queries (such as COGNOS or SQL Plus) to view the fields.
     4.5.15.4. Entries through the DIFMS Update Screen MS101P “Anticipated Credit”
     decrement the requisition-level Debit Unmatched Commercial Bill Net Balance when
     moving an Unmatched Commercial Bill into Accounts Receivable. If the program zeroes
     out this balance, the requisition level Date Aged value is also removed. This is consistent
     with changes to the category of the detail bill record from a ‘C’ (Unmatched) to ‘B’
     (Accounts Receivable).         Entries through the DIFMS Update Screen MS102P
     “Unmatched Material Bill Write-Off” decrement the new requisition level Debit
     Unmatched Commercial Bill Net Balance amount whenever a Debit Unmatched
     Commercial Bill is written off. The program rejects the transactions if they were
     attempted against write-offs on requisitions entered through DIFMS Update Screen
     MS741P.
     4.5.15.5. Entries through the DIFMS Update Screen MS106P “Supply Warehouse
     Refusal/Over Issue Adjustment” increment the requisition level Debit Unmatched
     Commercial Bill Net Balance by the amount of the Credit Bill being combined (i.e.
     actually decrementing it) when combining a Debit and Credit bill. If the action causes
     the net balance for the requisition to reach zero, the requisition level Date Aged is also
     removed.
     4.5.15.6. Entries through the DIFMS Update Screen MS183P “Material Accounts
     Payable Write-Off” decrement the new requisition level Debit Commercial Accounts
     Payable Net Balance amount whenever a Debit (positive) Commercial Accounts Payable
     (NIMMS-Code ‘A1’) is written off. In addition, attempted write-offs of (positive)
     Commercial Accounts Payable are rejected if attempted against write-offs on requisitions
     entered through the DIFMS Update Screen MS741P.
100                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      4.5.15.7. Entries through the DIFMS Update Screen MS189P “Requisition Number
      Correction” increment the requisition level Debit Unmatched Commercial Bill Net
      Balance Amount on the “New” Requisition and decrement that field on the “Old”
      Requisition when the bill being moved was a Commercial Debit Bill (Record-Name ‘B6’
      or ‘BB’). The process also does maintenance on the Date-Aged-Debit-UCB for both
      requisition numbers. If the Debit bill being moved is the first one against the new
      requisition, or is earlier than any existing one, then the Transaction-Date of that bill
      becomes the Date-Aged for the “New” requisition. Similarly, if the requisition being
      moved is the last one for the “Old” Requisition, the Date-Aged for the “Old” requisition
      is removed. If it is not, the Date-Aged for the “Old” requisition is reset to the earliest of
      the remaining bills.
      4.5.15.8. The DIFMS Program MS280P “Process Material Data” increments the
      requisition level Debit Commercial Accounts Payable Net Balance Amount when
      processing “positive” Commercial Receipts (NIMMS-Code ‘A1’). The program also sets
      the requisition level Date-Aged for Debit-Commercial-Accounts-Payable if one had not
      previously been set.
      4.5.15.9. DIFMS Report 7310-472 “Aged Material Accounts Payable” displays the
      requisition level Net Balance and Date-Aged for Commercial Accounts Payable along
      with the detail line items (both positive Receipts and “offsetting” Debit Unmatched
      Commercial Bills) that support that balance. In addition, “negative” (credit) receipts are
      displayed with their individual amount populating the Net Balance column in order to aid
      in the subsidiary totaling. Similarly, the DIFMS 7310-484 Report “Aged Unmatched
      Bills” displays the requisition level Net Balance and Date-Aged for Unmatched
      Commercial Bills along with the detail line items (both Debit Bills and “offsetting”
      positive Commercial Receipts) that support that balance. In addition, Credit Unmatched
      Commercial Bills are displayed with their individual amount populating the Net Balance
      column in order to aid in the subsidiary totaling.
      4.5.15.10. DIFMS Report 7310-498 “Commercial Material Unmatched” contains all
      detail bills and receipts (Unmatched Bills and Accounts Payable), including those that
      have successfully matched, for each commercial material requisition that is not
      financially complete (Material-Due Status is not ‘3’). The report is easier to use as a
      research tool than the standard aging reports for DIFMS Reports 7310-472 “Commercial
      Accounts Payable” and 7310-484 “Unmatched Commercial Bills” as it gives a more
      complete picture of the entire requisition.
      4.5.15.11. DIFMS Report 7310-461 “Transactions Clearing Material Requisition Status”
      includes four new sections because of this change. Sections for the “Accounts
      Payable/Unmatched Commercial Bill Netting” and “Reversal of Previous Accounts
      Payable/Unmatched Commercial Bill Netting” report the “netting” and “reverse netting”
      posting events performed by DIFMS Process MS270P. In addition, sections for Net
      Unmatched Commercial Bill Write Offs and Net Accounts Payable Write-Offs have been
      added to display the results of DIFMS Screen MS741P.
      4.5.15.12. DIFMS Report MS741P allows for write-offs of requisition level net balances
      for Debit Unmatched Commercial Bills and Debit (Positive) Commercial Accounts
      Payable. The screen contains the two previously mentioned fields and an Action-Code
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                       101


       field. There are two Action-Code values: ‘I’ (Inquire) and ‘W’ (Write-Off). The user
       first inquires and the response screen populates the appropriate amount field. Then the
       user enters an Action-Code of ‘W’ to initiate the net write-off. The resultant write-off
       creates an addition Material Requisition Status record with a Record-Name of ‘AN’
       (Netted Write-Off) and flag it as a “Current Cycle Adjustment” (Status ‘W’) along with
       new Posting Conditions and Adjustment-Flags which allow the write-offs to be reported
       in new sections of the 7310-461 report. In addition, all affected detail records that
       support the netted balance is also set to a status of “closed” (3) and updated with the same
       Adjustment-Flag value as the summary net write-off record itself. Net Write-Offs are not
       allowed if other “Current Cycle Adjustment” (Status ‘W’) records exist for the input
       Requisition Number.
   4.5.16. Batch Write-Off is available through the DIFMS Update Screens MS103P “Batched
   MIT Write-Off”. MS104P “Batched Material Accounts Payable (A/P) Write-Off”, MS105P
   “Batched Unmatched Material Bill Write-Off” and MS109P “Batched Material Write-Off
   Parameters”. These screens must have very limited access and must be tightly controlled
   (see paragraph 1.7.4).
   4.5.17. Use DIFMS Update Screen MS192P “System JON Shop” to update the system
   information record with a standard Job Order Number/Shop.
4.6. Material Review, Analysis, and Balancing
   4.6.1. The sources for material information are DIFMS inquiry screens, reports, and queries;
   DDS standard and ad-hoc reports; and H033-CPPM on-line reports. ABOM and NIMMS
   also provide screens, processes, and reports for the day-to-day material processing.
   Reference ABOM, NIMMS user manuals, and AFMCI 21-130.
4.6.2. Cumulative cost information
       4.6.2.1. CPPM Direct Material screen can be used to analyze expense, exchange, and
       non-exchange material by RCC and above.
       4.6.2.2. CPPM Indirect Material screen can be used to analyze material expenses by
       shop, RCC, ‘U’ Account, and JON.
       4.6.2.3. DIFMS Inquiry Screens MS052P “Job Order” and MS056P “Indirect Job Order”
       can be used to inquire on cumulative JON cost.
       4.6.2.4. DIFMS Inquiry Screens MS031P “Cost and Expense Material/Other” and
       MS035P “Cost Adjustment Research” can be used to inquire on cumulative cost at the
       JON and shop level.
       4.6.2.5. DIFMS Reports 7310-783 “Direct Costs by Cost Center Year to Date” and 7310-
       785 “Indirect Cost Summary Year-To-Date” show year to date cost by JON and shop.
       4.6.2.6. Queries can also be run against the DIFMS, DDS, and H033 databases for
       cumulative cost information.
   4.6.3. Current cycle cost
       4.6.3.1. DIFMS Report 7310-412 “Daily Material Expenditures by Job Number” reflects
       material expenditures by job order number/shop. It includes valid, invalid, and corrected
102                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      records. It provides a record count and summary amounts for incoming records, errors
      suspended, errors corrected and total records processed.
      4.6.3.2. DIFMS Report 7310-421 “Material Expenditures by Cost Center” is a material
      expenditure report in Shop sequence. It allows for tracking costs by Cost Center as
      opposed to Job Order Number. The data on this report is the summarized costs for the
      week on DIFMS Report 7310-412 and agree with DIFMS Report 7310-424. Note: this
      report runs daily.
      4.6.3.3. DIFMS Report 7310-424 “Material Expenditures Summary by Expense Count”
      displays material expenditures summarized by expense account. The same costs on
      DIFMS Report 7310-412 are summarized by expense account for this report. The
      TOTAL DIR, TOTAL PROD, TOTAL GEN, TOTAL SERV equals the postings to
      USSGL accounts 610000W2 Direct Cost-Material, 610000W3 Production Expense-
      Material, 610000W4 General Expense-Material, and 6100.00W1 Service Costs-Material
      respectively. USSGL Account 610000W1 is not used at the present. It also reflects the
      net change to USSGL account 199000B Other Assets - Unallocated Material
      Expenditures. Note: report runs daily.
      4.6.3.4. DIFMS Report 7310-427 “Material Expenditures Distribution by Direct Job
      Order” is a quick reference for direct job order number material costs. Note: report runs
      daily.
      4.6.3.5. Transaction history and research
      4.6.3.6. DIFMS Inquiry MS036P “Obligation Inquiry by Job Order” allows inquiry on
      Material Due, Travel Accrual, Doc-Job-Shop, or Major Maintenance Project records
      associated with a job order number.
      4.6.3.7. DIFMS Inquiry MS061P “Material Requisition Status” allows the user to query
      the database for either specific information or on all records for a requisition number.
      4.6.3.8. DIFMS Inquiry MS062P “Commitment/Obligation by Project Order Number
      (PON)/Document” allows the user to query the database for specific information on
      Material Dues.
  4.6.3.9. DIFMS Report 7310-431 “Detail Inventory Adjustments” displays miscellaneous
  increases or decreases to inventory. Daily material receipts from CSAG Supply, post CAM,
  are displayed as a NIMMS-CD ‘D6’ transaction, and turn-ins (receipt returns) to CSAG
  Supply are displayed as a NIMMS-CD ‘M6’ transactions.
      4.6.3.10. DIFMS Report 7310-461 “Transactions Clearing Requisition Status” displays
      requisition numbers entered via DIFMS Update Screen MS189P “Material Requisition
      Number Correction” which allows users to move a government bill from one requisition
      number to another. Use this report by the when determining status of requisitions. The
      report shows the effect of updates to the Material Requisition Status file. A Journal
      Voucher updates the applicable General Ledger Accounts.
      4.6.3.11. DIFMS Report 7310-462 “Processed Material Bills” assists in researching
      Material-in-Transit and displays transactions made in DIFMS Update Screen MS136P

     4.6.3.12. DIFMS Report 7310-487 “Requisition Number Correction” displays requisition
     numbers entered on DIFMS Update Screen MS189P “Material Requisition Number
     Correction”. Use this report as a reference when researching Material-in-Transit. This
     report displays requisition number corrections input on DIFMS Update Screen MS189P.
     4.6.3.12.1. Queries can also be run against the DIFMS and DDS databases for
     transaction history.
  4.6.4. Responsibilities in this paragraph are shared by ABOM/NIMMS users and the DIFMS
  financial analysts. Material balancing requires the users responsible for inputting material
  transactions affecting inventory/cost review the following reports for accuracy of input. The
  financial impact of material in organic depot maintenance depends on the accuracy of
  transactions reflected on these reports. Transaction input accuracy is the responsibility of the
  Production Support Technician (PST). In most cases, if the PST finds an error on input of
  the transaction it also shows up on the NIMMS Report MN507R01 “Daily Suspense
  Listing”. This report reflects errors in the transactions. Once the NIMMS user corrects the
  error, the correction also fixes the Due-In From Maintenance (DIFM) errors that have been
  generated.
  4.6.5. DIFMS Report 7310-412 “Daily Material Expenditures by Job Number” reflects valid,
  invalid and corrected records.
  4.6.6. DIFMS Report 7310-415 “Weekly Unallocated Material Expenditures” is a subsidiary
  for USSGL accounts 1990.00B, Unallocated Material Expenditures; 962100, Unidentified
  Costs-Customer Furnished Material; and 962200, Unidentified Costs-Government Furnished
  Material. Ending Balance of USSGL accounts 199000B, 662200, and 662100 on the report
  should be equal with General Ledger accounts. Net change amount should equal by expense
  account number at miscellaneous totals section on DIFMS Report 7310-424 “Expenditures
  Expenses Account”.
     4.6.6.1. Beginning Balance = Total of Prior Cycle Unallocated Material + Total
     Corrected Unallocated Material.
     4.6.6.2. Net Change = Total of Current Cycle Unallocated Material - Corrected
     Unallocated Material.
     4.6.6.3. Ending Balance = Total of Current Cycle Unallocated Material + Total Prior
     Cycle Unallocated Material.
  4.6.7. DIFMS Report 7310-421 “Weekly Material Expenditures by Cost Center”. Total for
  each category should equal DIFMS Report 7310-424 “Weekly Material Expenditures
  Summary by Expense Account”. Subtract miscellaneous totals as applicable.
  4.6.8. DIFMS Report 7310-427 “Weekly Material Expenditures Distribution”. Total for
  each category should equal DIFMS Report 7310-424 “Weekly Material Expenditures

  balances for which all-subsidiary ledger account balances agree at the end of the processing
  cycle. The report displays mechanized Journal Vouchers for the processing cycle. The
  report can be used as a research tool to track postings in Out-Of-Balance conditions. Reports
  that generate mechanized JVs can also be used to identify transactions that may have created
  an out-of-balance condition. Research that is more thorough can be performed if initiated
  during the same period the out-of-balance has occurred. The accounts that are posted can be
  traced through the Journal Voucher number to DIFMS Reports 7310-945 and 7310-915

                                           Chapter 5

            COLLECT/TRACK COST/EXPENSE-BUSINESS OPERATIONS

5.1. Introduction
   5.1.1. All costs of working capital fund operations must be collected and recorded. These
   costs include all resources consumed by depot maintenance including labor and material as
   covered in other chapters as well as the business operation costs covered in this chapter.
   Resources include services and goods consumed by organizations supporting depot
   maintenance as well as consumed directly. The costs of resources furnished at no charge to
   depot maintenance are referred to as unfunded costs. The costs of resources charged to depot
   maintenance are funded costs.
   5.1.2. Costs of depot maintenance are classified as direct or indirect (overhead) depending
   on whether increments of a particular cost can be directly and economically identified to a
   specific depot maintenance direct job order. Costs meeting this criterion are direct costs. All
   other costs are indirect costs. Indirect costs are further classified depending on whether a
   cost can be directly and economically identified to a specific area of direct production effort.
   Costs meeting this criterion are production overhead costs. All other indirect costs are
   general and administrative costs.
   5.1.3. Defense Industrial Financial Management System (DIFMS) in the Other Cost
   subsystem establishes, updates, changes, or deletes and reports asset/liability records for
   business operations other than labor, material, and fixed assets. The policy and procedures in
   this Air Force Materiel Command Instruction refers to “Other” as “Business Operations”
   because the latter term is more descriptive. The function processes accrual costs, final
   accruals, discounts, setup charges, deposits, freight, and deductions; amortizes prepaid
   expenses, write-offs of account balances, and accrual liquidations; calculates contingent
   liabilities; and journalizes the Schedule of Accruals. The Business Operations Cost
   subsystem reports business operations cost by expense account and by job order number.
   The Business Operations (Other) Cost subsystem processes all obligation type transactions
   that are not labor and material. This includes services contracts, Military Inter-departmental
   Purchase Request (MIPR), Miscellaneous Obligation Requirements Document (MORD),
   Government-Wide Purchase Card (GPC), and travel transactions. For Capital Investment
   Program (CIP) and depreciation - see Chapter 10.

5.2. Line of Accounting
   5.2.1. The Line of Accounting (LOA) must be included on all documents generated for fund
   codes ‘6L’ (Tinker AFB), ‘6M’ (Hill AFB), and ‘6Z’ (Robins AFB). Examples can include
   purchase requests, purchase orders, Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursement Documents
   (MORD), Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR), etc. Note: The LOA for the
   Capital Investment Program (CIP) is covered in Chapter 10.
      5.2.1.1. The following data elements are required in the hard copy document LOA.
      These fields are crucial for proper depot maintenance accounting using DIFMS.

      5.2.1.2. Additional fields of the LOA, include appropriation, Operating Agency Code
      (OAC), Operating Budget Assignment Number (OBAN), Fund Code (FC), Fiscal Year
      (FY), Element of Expense/Investment Code (EEIC), and Accounting Disbursing Station
      Number (ADSN). AFMC/FM provides the Center FM offices a Standard Indirect JON
      List and AFMC Standard Contractual Other Code (COC) List. AFMC/FM maintains
      these lists and provides updates, as required.
   5.2.2. The cost code within each Line of Accounting must be unique. Each commitment
   should have only one obligation number. In exceptional cases where a commitment
   document is required to fund multiple contracts, unique cost code assignments must be made
   for each contract accounting line.
      5.2.2.1. Each ALC must institute a disciplined process to assign a cost code manually for
      entry into the long Line of Accounting (LOA) on the physical (original) document and
      entry on DIFMS Update Screen MS112P “Asset Liability”. For commercial material
      buys, use the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Industrial Material Management
      System (NIMMS) Screen MN012P (Requisitioning Establishment) (See Chapter 4 for
      further details). The ALC must maintain a Cost Code Log, which contains a table to
      connect the cost code to the line of accounting to the document number. The log must
      contain, at a minimum, the Cost Code, Document Number, each LOA (if more than one
      line is on a document), Date of Assignment, and the Assignor’s Initials.
      5.2.2.2. The cost code is the major systemic transaction identifier in DMAPS. The 8-
      position cost code links GAFS-BL/BQ, DFAS-IE, and DIFMS for all business operations
      transactions. If the cost code entered in DIFMS does not match the cost code that was
 114                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


       entered into other systems, the obligation and cash action generated by GAFS-BL/BQ
       will not match and will be rejected. Cost code control and reconciliation is vital to
       assuring accurate processing.
       5.2.2.3. The composition of the eight-position cost code is as follows: Positions 1-2
       describe the item: Use (MU) for Material Items Commercially Procured Un-accrued ,
       (SU) for Services Item Un-accrued , (SA) for Services Item Accrued by Amount , and
       (ST) for Services Item Accrued by Time. Cost codes starting with ‘C’ are for CIP, which
       is covered in Chapter 10. Positions 3-4 represent the two-digit fiscal year and positions
       5-8 contain a uniquely assigned, serialized number.
   5.2.3. The Contractual Other Code (COC) is a two-position element, which further defines
   business operations expenses within DIFMS. There is a unique linkage among indirect JON,
   COC, and United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL). COCs ‘01’-‘50’, excluding ‘45’
   (Military Labor), are considered contractual costs. COCs ‘51’-‘99’ (excluding depreciation
   COCs of ‘54’, ‘59’, and ‘60’), are considered ‘business operations’ on the cost summary
   reports.
   5.2.4. The Shop Code is the five-position element representing the organization (AOC or
   RCC) where costs are collected.
   5.2.5. The JON is a 12-position element, and considered “direct” or “indirect. If “indirect”,
   the JON must be linked to the COC. If “direct”, travel (A-JON) COC ‘87’ is used. If other
   direct, choose the COC based on the services provided. Note: The COC for CIP (F-JON) is
   ‘38’ and is covered in detail in Chapter 10.
5.3. Goods and Services Commitment
   5.3.1. Center personnel use the following commitment process. Center personnel must enter
   transactions in both DIFMS and other systems (such as GAFS-BL/BQ) until automated
   interfaces or other process changes are implemented.
   5.3.2. The requesting organization’s Resource Advisor (RA) verifies availability of funding
   for requested goods or services. The line of accounting (LOA) is assigned, including the
   JON, Shop, cost code, and COC; and forwarded for approval to the appropriate office(s).
   The certifying office enters the commitment information in DIFMS on Update Screen
   MS112P “Asset Liability Update” to validate the LOA, including JON and shop. Once the
   LOA is validated, the commitment is certified in Automated Base Services System (ABSS)
   and entered in GAFS-BL/BQ. Once certified, ABSS electronically routes the information to
   appropriate offices, such as the initiator or contracting. ABSS routes disapprovals to the
   initiator.
   5.3.3. For the purposes of establishing a commitment, DIFMS Update Screen MS112P
   allows the users to add, inquire, and change the commitment or contingent liability. All
   commitments are initially established as posting code ‘5’ with the exception of the
   miscellaneous civilian pay MORDs, collections or credits (posting code ‘6’) and the military
   labor accrual (posting code ‘8’). Based on the source and type of services being procured,
   the service acquisition code and Working Capital Fund (WCF) indicator must also be
   entered.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                       115


   5.3.3.1. MORDS in regards to Labor, (i.e. Miscellaneous Civilian Pay, Collections or credits
   posting code “6”, and the Military Labor Accrual posting code “8”) are covered in detail in
   Chapter 3 – Labor.
   5.3.4. Accounting entries in DIFMS at the commitment stage are a debit to allotments
   (USSGL account 461040A) and a credit to commitments (USSGL account 470040A). The
   associated entry 7can be seen on DIFMS Report 7310-604 “Schedule of
   Commitments/Obligations”.
5.4. Goods and Services Obligations
   5.4.1. An obligation is based on notification of contract award and entered into GAFS-
   BL/BQ. GAFS-BL/BQ interfaces the obligations to the DFAS-IE daily. DFAS-IE sends the
   change transactions to DIFMS for changing the commitments to obligations. These
   transactions are validated by the DIFMS Program MS210P “Asset Liability Batch
   Validation” and valid transactions are shown on the DIFMS Report 7310-642 “Doc-Job-
   Shop Update (Part 1)”. Invalid transactions are on Part 2 of this report. Manually correct
   these invalid transactions on the DIFMS Update Screen MS112P.
   5.4.2. Accounting entries in DIFMS, at the obligation stage, are a debit to commitments
   (USSGL account 470040A) and a credit to obligations (USSGL account 4801-series). The
   fifth and sixth positions of the obligation USSGL is ‘41’ for government service acquisition
   codes within the WCF (‘W’), DoD (‘D’) and Other Government (‘O’) and ‘42’ for public
   (‘P’). The seventh position is operations (‘Y’) and eighth position is determined by the
   COC). The associated entry can be seen on DIFMS Report 7310-604 “Schedule of
   Commitments/Obligations”. DIFMS Screen MS112P and the DIFMS Program MS210P
   “Batch Asset Liability Update” allow the authorized obligation to be set to zero on a posting
   code ‘3’ record when there is a Purchase Order Number (PON) associated with the record
   (“net to zero”). This provides a means for closing these records as well as properly reflecting
   the reduction in the budgetary obligation. Posting code ‘3’ records, which are intended to be
   utilized as Deferred Charges, are used within DIFMS to hold the summary payment data on
   bankcards. These records are liquidated by the summary payment. The initial obligation has
   to be established to allow the summary liquidation to process through cash. The liquidation
   ultimately is reduced by the “zero batch” summary payment credit when the charges are
   redistributed to individual requisitions. Once the liquidation is reduced, the initial summary
   obligation amount needs to be reduced so that the overall obligated authority is not overstated
   (not counted on both the bankcard summary record and the detail requisitions). DIFMS
   Update Screen MS111P “Asset/Liability Structure Correction” ensures that records cannot be
   modified when costs have been incurred. This validation includes Account Payable Balance
   Amount Liquidated in all such validation checks. In addition, the ability to change Job
   Number and/or Shop only disallows changes when the “net balance” is not zero (i.e. Accrual
   Amount minus Accrual Amount Liquidated or Accounts Payable Balance Amount minus
   Accounts Payable Balance Amount Liquidated). The validation in DIFMS Update Screen
   MS111P should prevent inappropriate transactions from occurring in the system.
5.5. Other Expense Distribution
   5.5.1. Accrual records are identified in the obligating documents by the first two digits of the
   cost code. Cost codes beginning with ‘SA’ or ‘ST’ are to be accrued. Cost codes beginning
   with ‘SU’ and ‘MU’ are not to be accrued, along with CIP.
116                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      5.5.1.1. Use DIFMS Update Screen MS112P to establish an accrual in DIFMS. The
      screen allows the user to inquire, establish, change, finalize, or re-open Accrual,
      Contingent Liability, and Direct Cite data for non-travel accrued and un-accrued costs
      such as contracts. The actual accrual amount is recorded based on the DIFMS Program
      MS265P “Validate Accrual Data” which increases the balance in the accrual amount on
      the record. The results show on DIFMS Report 7310-605 “Schedule of Accruals”.
      Accrual errors show on DIFMS Report 7310-610 “Accrual Rejects”. The user cannot
      change a document number or task number if there are liquidations against it.
      5.5.1.2. Cost codes beginning with ‘SA’ are to be accrued based on an authorized accrual
      amount provided by the ALC. These accruals are based on an irregular, non-straight-line
      series of amounts (e.g., Utilities, DOCAT, etc). The posting code is changed to ‘7’ on
      DIFMS MS112P immediately after the obligation is recorded. The authorized accrual
      amount is manually changed periodically to the cumulative authorized accrual value for
      the life of the expense. More information on DOCATs can be found in Chapter 3 –
      Labor.
      5.5.1.3. Cost codes beginning with ‘ST’ are to be accrued based on the obligation and
      period of performance on the contract. These accruals are based on a straight-line series
      of amounts. The posting code is changed to ‘1’ on DIFMS Update Screen MS112P
      immediately after the obligation is recorded. The system automatically accrues the
      proper amount of the authorized accrual over the entered period of performance.
      5.5.1.4. Accrual transactions post a credit to USSGL account 211041 (Government) or
      USSGL account 211042 (Public) with an offsetting debit to business operations expense
      USSGL accounts 610000 I through V and X through Z, based on COC. The
      corresponding budgetary entry is a credit to the USSGL account 4801-series and a debit
      to accrued expenditures unpaid in the USSGL account 4901-series. For budgetary
      accounts, positions 5-8 are as covered above. These transactions can be found on DIFMS
      Report 7310-605 “Schedule of Accruals”. If DIFMS cannot process the accrual (closed
      JON, shop not valid, etc.), the transaction is rejected to the DIFMS Report 7310-610
      “Accrual Rejects”. To correct rejected accruals, use the DIFMS Update Screens MS112P
      “Asset Liability Update” and/or MS111P “Asset Liability Structure Correction”.
  5.5.2. The Accounts Payable process is described by the steps necessary to establish and
  record an Accounts Payable against the job order and shop that is designated on the
  procurement document. The Accounts Payable is based on the receipt action for the goods or
  services.
      5.5.2.1. Valid payable transactions are shown on DIFMS Report 7310-642, “Doc-Job-
      Shop Update (Part 1)”. The invalid accounts payable transactions are shown in Part 2 of
      this report. This report must be monitored daily because the information is not
      cumulative. Correct the errors through input in DIFMS Update Screen MS112P. If not
      corrected, the cash disbursement suspends on DIFMS Report 7310-322 “Weekly
      Unallocated Details” and be corrected at that time.
      5.5.2.2. Payable transactions post a credit to USSGL account 211041B (Government) or
      USSGL account 211042B3 (Public) with an offsetting debit to business operations
      expense in USSGL account 610000 I through V and X through Z, based on COC. The
      corresponding budgetary entry is a credit to the USSGL 4801 series and a debit to
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                   117


     accrued expenditures unpaid in the USSGL 4901 series. For budgetary accounts,
     positions 5-8 are as covered above. These transactions can be found on DIFMS report
     7310-605 “Schedule of Accruals”. If DIFMS cannot process the payable (closed JON,
     shop not valid, etc.), the transaction is rejected to the DIFMS report 7310-610 “Accrual
     Rejects”. To correct rejected payables, use the DIFMS Screens MS112P and/or MS111P.
  5.5.3. Government-Wide Purchase Card (GPC) for Services
     5.5.3.1. Service buys are accounted for at the cardholder level, much as described for the
     material buys. The only differences are that the summary obligation data is passed from
     GAFS-BL/BQ to DIFMS via the DFAS-IE.
     5.5.3.2. Cost transfers are implemented for GPC purchases that should be charged to
     direct or other indirect JONs. The cardholder determines the cost transfers required when
     reviewing the monthly summary payment received from the GPC vendor or when the
     initial card is issued.
     5.5.3.3. Summary records are established in the Business Operations (Other) Cost
     subsystem of DIFMS for the service GPC purchases.
     5.5.3.4. The procedures below describe how to record the GPC summary payments, and
     then distribute the charges to the appropriate JON level for services buys. This process
     assumes that service buys are recorded and liquidated at the cardholder level. It assumes
     that cost transfers are made, as required, for the proper JON charges.
        5.5.3.4.1. The GPC payments are made at a summary level. Each cardholder and
        certifying official certifies the invoice for payment, and the payment is at the
        certifying official level. The summary payment at the cardholder level liquidates the
        accounts payable at the summary level. DIFMS requires a match between the
        originally recorded obligation/receipt and the subsequent disbursement transaction.
        5.5.3.4.2. Nearly all service GPC buys are to indirect JONs. The monthly bankcard
        payment is allowed to process and liquidate at the summary level the obligation and
        expense amounts recorded at the time the invoice amount was certified by the
        cardholder and/or certifying official.
        5.5.3.4.3. Service GPC buys are recorded in DIFMS and GAFS-BL/BQ. The cost
        code on the service summary record should be coded with an ‘SU’ rather than a
        ‘MU’, which is used for the material purchases. The obligation for the ‘SU’ service
        purchases come to DIFMS via the IE from GAFS-BL/BQ. The commitment for cost
        codes coded with ‘SU’ must be directly input into the DIFMS Update Screen
        MS112P. The commitment record must also be input into GAFS-BL/BQ. The ‘SU’
        transactions are not passed from GAFS-BL/BQ to DIFMS.
        5.5.3.4.4. An accounts payable value equal to the summary invoice amounts must be
        input into DIFMS as a change transaction via DIFMS Update Screen MS112P at the
        time the invoice is certified for payment. Records with ‘SU’ cost codes are not
        accrued. The expense generated by the input of the authorized accounts payable
        amount are liquidated by the cash payment made to the bankcard company. The GPC
        payment occurs each month based on the certified invoice. At the end of the fiscal
        year, a 13th cycle is run.
118                                                           AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


         5.5.3.4.5. Where appropriate, use the DIFMS cost transfer process to move the GPC
         expense on a pseudo-JON to a direct or indirect JON. The cardholder or certifying
         official must prepare a cost transfer document to be input to DIFMS Update Screen
         MS144P “Cost Adjustment” for the charges. This transfer document would show the
         direct and/or indirect JON and amount for each purchase, and a credit to the pseudo-
         JON, which is stated on the GPC obligation document. Cost Accounting inputs the
         cost transfer transaction.
      5.5.3.5. The following procedures are in support of AFI 64-117. If the user desires
      detailed knowledge of GPC processes, please reference this Instruction.
         5.5.3.5.1. Use a separate AF IMT 4009, Government Purchase Card Fund Cite
         Authorization, for each billing account. Each AF IMT 4009 must have a unique LOA
         cost code.
         5.5.3.5.2. All services purchases (obligations) are recorded in DIFMS via GAFS-
         BL/BQ by the Center at the time the payment is made. This means that service
         purchases are recorded monthly at the summary rather than the detail level.
      5.5.3.6. GPC for services
         5.5.3.6.1. The cardholder obtains a credit card and processes AF IMT 4009 in
         accordance with the procedures found in AFI 64-117.
         5.5.3.6.2. The cardholder cannot make a purchase until the AF IMT 4009 is
         coordinated, certified, and approved. The amount of the AF IMT 4009 is recorded as
         a commitment in DIFMS. Once accepted as a valid record in DIFMS, the Center
         inputs AF IMT 4009 into GAFS-BL/BQ to establish a commitment with a single
         depot maintenance Line of Accounting. The cost code will contain ‘SU’ or ‘MU’ in
         positions 1 and 2.
         5.5.3.6.3. Cardholder enters purchase into GPC purchase log as described in AFI 64-
         117.
         5.5.3.6.4. Once the GPC payment has been made for the purchases of the month, the
         summary payment amounts are posted to the AF IMT 4009 level. This is done based
         on the GPC statement showing the total purchases for each AF IMT 4009. The total
         purchases for the month for the AF IMT 4009 are posted as the obligation/receipt
         amount. The obligation amount is posted in GAFS-BL/BQ and passed to DIFMS via
         the DFAS-IE.
         5.5.3.6.5. In posting the obligation, the obligation must be made against the
         document number established by the commitment. The payment amount on the GPC
         statement for the AF IMT 4009 is established as an obligation amount. After the first
         month, the GPC payment amount is recorded in GAFS-BL/BQ as an amendment to
         the obligation value, and passed to DIFMS via the DFAS-IE. This is passed to
         DIFMS through the MS210D01 Interface, Asset Liability Batch, as an increase to the
         authorized obligation amount.
         5.5.3.6.6. Statements are received and reconciliation is accomplished as described in
         AFI 64-117.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                   119


        5.5.3.6.7. The payment record for the GPC purchases is recorded in GAFS-BL/BQ
        and passed to DIFMS via the DFAS-IE. The payment at a summary level for the AF
        IMT 4009 is recorded in GAFS-BL/BQ at the same time the obligation/receipt is
        made for the GPC purchases of the month. This payment must have the same number
        on the transaction as on the obligation to match in DIFMS. The payment transaction
        shows the document number, which is the AF IMT 4009 document number.
  5.5.4. Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory Items
     5.5.4.1. These procedures describe the steps to process contract Precision Measurement
     Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) transactions. Processes include the establishment of
     commitments and obligations, recording payables (or accruals) and cash liquidations, and
     cost transfers to customer JONs to affect the proper charges for the services provided.
     The procedures are explained below. Note: Organic (in-house) PMEL procedures are
     discussed in Chapter 3, Labor.
     5.5.4.2. All PMEL transactions concerning payment of the vendor performing the work
     are made at a summary (contract line) level. It is neither necessary nor desirable to have
     separate contract lines for each supported customer’s workload. The certifying official
     certifies invoices for payment, and payments are posted at the contract level. These
     summary payments liquidate the Accounts Payable (A/P) or Accrual at the summary
     level.
     5.5.4.3. Establish Accounts Payable or accrue costs via the DIFMS Update Screen
     MS112P “Asset Liability Update” for the total amount of the summary invoice
     authorized. Costs will be charged to the JON and shop on the PMEL obligation.
     5.5.4.4. Generally, there is a need to charge most of the contract PMEL costs to direct
     JONs (customer) or other indirect JONs and Shops. Use the cost transfer process to
     allocate charges for those amounts.
     5.5.4.5. Use the following steps for the PMEL process.
        5.5.4.5.1. As with any other contract, a commitment is first established in DIFMS for
        the annual anticipated PMEL buy amount. The commitment is posted via the DIFMS
        Update Screen MS112P before it is input into GAFS-BL/BQ. Record the
        commitment in DIFMS against the overhead JON and Shop cited on the AF IMT 9
        (Air Force Information Management Tool 9, Request for Purchase).
        5.5.4.5.2. The procurement system obtains a contract for the PMEL services. DFAS
        inputs the PMEL obligation into GAFS-BL/BQ, which passes the obligation amount
        to DIFMS via the DFAS-IE on a MS210D01 file. Rejected interface transactions are
        shown on report 7310-340 (DIFMS Cash Disbursement Register) and 7310-642
        (DIFMS Batch Doc-Job-Shop-Rec Update Valid), and must be corrected manually on
        MS112P.
        5.5.4.5.3. The vendor submits PMEL invoices to a certifying official. These invoices
        contain a listing of services provided by customer during the invoice period. The
        certifying official certifies the invoice, and forwards it to DFAS for payment.
        5.5.4.5.4. At the same time the certifying official certifies the invoice, the ALC
        records an A/P amount (or accrual) for the total invoice amount via DIFMS Update
120                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


         Screen MS112P. Increase the authorized A/P amount by the amount of the invoice,
         and the USSGL 211042C1 account number, if not present, needs to be added to
         record an A/P balance. The cash transaction generated by the payment requires that
         an A/P balance be present to liquidate.
         5.5.4.5.5. At the beginning of the fiscal year, the ALC receives funding documents
         from its customers, including those who are provided PMEL services under the
         PMEL contract. Those funding documents are input into DIFMS under the normal
         funding process, if the customer will be billed by DIFMS. “T” and “K” JONs are
         established for the PMEL charges. Ensure that the restriction codes on the JONs will
         allow the cost adjustments to be used for contract PMEL charges (i.e., third position
         is not a “9”).
         5.5.4.5.6. The Facility Equipment Management System (FEM) tracks the work done
         by the contractors (C-JONs) and CSAG employees (S-JONs) in the PME Lab by
         customer. Non- CSAG government customers whose equipment is repaired by the
         PMEL contractors reimburse the contract cost by providing a MORD to maintenance.
         Then a Post Code 6 MORD is prepared to establish a receivable in DIFMS to be
         liquidated by a 1080 prepared by Cost Accounting. The PC6 MORD accrual reduces
         the PMEL maintenance expense.
  5.5.5. Base Support Cost
      5.5.5.1. Includes all costs of support to the appropriate ALC provided by base
      organizations not accounted for as borrowed labor or contractual service cost and not
      identified as production overhead costs. The ALC Budget Program Review identifies the
      base support functions normally charged to the depot maintenance.
      5.5.5.2. A Support Agreement is required for each base support function reimbursed by
      depot maintenance. The agreement sets forth the services to be provided, the amount and
      method of payment, and the period covered. The agreement is valid only when signed at
      the ALC/CC level and the organization furnishing the support.
      5.5.5.3. Charge depot maintenance for only those funded costs incurred by the support
      organization.
      5.5.5.4. Personnel costs include the additional percentage amount of the base salary of
      the employees charged as base support cost to cover personnel benefits. Figure this
      percentage annually by dividing the cost of personnel benefits by the cost of base salary.
      5.5.5.5. Support organizations provide auditable detail to support the amount of service
      provided to organic depot maintenance. Appropriate personnel of ALC, the Comptroller,
      and the supporting organizations identify the number of positions that support organic
      depot maintenance and figure the annual cost. This is done in conjunction with
      preparation of the annual operating budget and results in the signed Support Agreement.
      5.5.5.6. Quarterly reviews are authorized during the year to adjust for significant
      increases or decreases for required services.
      5.5.5.7. The billing office summarizes funded base support costs based on the amount
      and method of payment contained in the Support Agreement (usually 1/12 of the annual
      cost is charged each month). Personnel on reimbursable positions are reimbursed at
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                       121


      actual cost. The summary is sent to the Commercial Services organization for
      preparation and processing of applicable SF 1080, Voucher for Transfer between
      Appropriation and/or Funds. The SF 1080 shows the bill number, the names of the
      billing offices and the office billed, descriptive information (with backup data attached),
      and the amounts by accounting classifications of both the billed and the billing offices.
      Note: The following may be found in Chapter 3 – Labor: Labor Costing, Cost Transfers
      for Labor, Military Labor Processing, Workers Compensation Processing, Civilian Pay
      MORDs, Miscellaneous Cash Transactions, Cash Awards, Reimbursements, DOCAT
      Employees, and Defense Civilian Payroll System (DCPS)
5.6. Travel (Manual Entry into DIFMS)
   5.6.1. Charge travel and per diem expenses (including regular labor hours spent in travel) as
   direct costs only if the labor hours worked while traveling are charged as direct labor. If
   more than a single job order is worked on, prorate the travel and per diem expenses based on
   the related direct labor. Otherwise, charge all travel and per diem expenses as an indirect
   expense of the employees’ cost center. Note: For more details regarding Direct Labor see
   Chapter 3 – Labor.
   5.6.2. Blanket Travel Orders cannot be used for depot maintenance. In DIFMS, there can be
   only one traveler per travel order. There can be only one JON used per travel order. DIFMS
   establishes a unique travel order for each traveler.
   5.6.3. Orders include fund cite, USSGL account, JON, shop, and object class in block 19 on
   DD Form 1610 or Defense Travel System (DTS) equivalent. A designated certifying officer
   in the travel office must authenticate and certify the travel orders. Travel orders that are not
   prepared in accordance with DoD Component Management guidance and administrative
   instructions (including AFI 65-103, JFTR/JTR, and DoD Financial Management Regulation
   Volume 9, Chapter 5), are returned by the travel office to the organization’s travel monitor
   for correction. The travel office validates the accounting line to include the JON and Shop
   combination.
   5.6.4. Requesters in the product divisions submit an approved original DD Form 1610,
   Request and Authorization for TDY Travel of DoD Personnel, assuring that all required
   information is included, to the travel office for review/certification of funds. The DD Form
   1610 has either the prefix of ‘TA’ to denote TDY Travel of DoD personnel for Continental
   United States (CONUS) travel, ‘TB’ for CONUS travel, or ‘Y’ for formal civilian training.
      5.6.4.1. A copy of the AF IMT 938, Request and Authorization for Active Duty
      Training/Active Duty Tour, generated by Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)
      Automated Orders Program with a prefix of ‘D’ and manually prepared AF IMT 938 with
      a prefix of ‘DA’, is also provided.
      5.6.4.2. An original AF IMT 938 with a prefix of ‘R’ for reserve duty is forwarded to the
      travel office for certification. Contingency, Exercise, and Deployment (CED) orders with
      a prefix of ‘TE’ are provided by the local PRF to FMFS for certification. A copy of
      AFRC Reserve Mobilization orders with a prefix of ‘A’ is also provided.
      5.6.4.3. A copy of all funded certified travel orders must be provided to the travel claims
      processor for input into DIFMS.
 122                                                             AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


   5.6.5. The travel computation system is processed in the Reserve Travel System (RTS).
   Upon completion of travel, DIFMS retrieves the order number and settlement data from
   GAFS-BL/BQ and settles the claim for accounting purposes.
   5.6.6. DIFMS requires a 15-position travel order number. The diagram below describes the
   format of the DIFMS travel order number.

Figure 5.1. Travel Order Number (15 positions)




       5.6.6.1. The travel advance is recorded against the travel obligation based upon the cash
       transaction processed in the cash subsystem. Once the advance comes through, the users
       are able to inquire about the transaction with DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS013P “Travel
       Order Number Inquiry” and view the information on DIFMS Reports 7310-645
       “Asset/Liability Balances” or 7310-615 “Outstanding Travel Advances”. DIFMS
       processes travel advances through the cash Subsystem as a ‘1K’ transaction type code.
       Upon settlement of the travel voucher and the advance in GAFS-BL/BQ, the travel
       advance is reversed and liquidated.
       5.6.6.2. The LOA for travel orders in DIFMS should be constructed as follows:
       5.6.6.3. An example of an Indirect Travel ‘fund cite’ that can be used for a manual travel

       000000 503000 F0330L X54120308000 MAFPBA. (The PSR and FSR must be included
       along with the ‘fund cite’ to assure that correct payment is made.) The _ after 6Z is to be
       filled with the Numeric for Fiscal Year. The F after the 55412 is for the current 6th
       position of the GLAC – account signifying the Maintenance Organization that the travel
       expense is charged to. At the end of the LOA is the DIFMS Indirect JON that

       corresponds to USSGL account 610000I3. The last field is the Shop/RCC (MAFPBA is
       just an example) that is performing the Temporary Duty (TDY) and incurs the travel
       expenses.
       5.6.6.4. Below is a list of Indirect JONs to be used for travel purposes.

   entered into DIFMS: 97X4930.FA29 6Z_ 47E8 52412_ 000000 00000 000000 503000
   F0330L A2815N22A MAFPBA. (The PSR and FSR must be included along with the ‘fund
   cite’ to assure that correct payment is made.) As above, the _ after ‘6Z’ is to be null since
   there is no Year funds involved. The F after the ‘52412’ is for the current 6th position of the
   AF GLAC account. At the end of the LOA is the "complete" Direct JON that the Direct
   Travel is charged to. The last field is the Shop/RCC (‘MAFPBA’ is just an example) that
   incurs the Travel Expenses.
       5.6.7.1. The Shop/RCC is critical to DIFMS in that the travel costs are charged or
       expensed to the shop designated in the LOA. This is a peculiar situation when direct
       travel is performed. For example, the 653 Combat Logistics Support Squadron (CLSS)
       performs direct travel using ‘6Z’ funds. For example: Traveler: SSgt. Brown,
       Organizational Element: 653 CLSS/LGXY TDY Purpose: F-15 Burn Damage LOA:
       97X4930.FA29 6Z2 47E8 52412F 000000 00000 000000 503000 F0330L A2815N.
       Traveler is assigned to 653 CLSS/LGXY but travel costs are expensed to the F-15
       maintenance organization of (example: MAFPBA) for F-15 work performed.
       5.6.7.2. The travel order is entered into the H069 System - GAFS-BL/BQ by the travel
       office or a system printout is sent out for approval and entered into GAFS-BL/BQ under
       the Defense Travel System (DTS) or other local systems. Reserve Orders are established
       in AROWS-R (Air Force Reserve Order Writing system). The manual travel orders
       (PCS, Reserves, Special) are entered into DIFMS. This is a dual process until automation
       occurs.
   5.6.8. The following sub-paragraphs describe the DIFMS processing for DTS using DIFMS
   Program MS668P “Batch DTS Travel Accrual Record Validation”.
 124                                                             AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


       5.6.8.1. The program reads an input file from DTS and performs the appropriate edit and
       validation checks on each record. The program automatically posts valid transactions
       against the DIFMS database. The program returns invalid transactions to DTS along with
       appropriate error message. The program automatically restarts itself once it successfully
       processes a file. Input files can be processed as frequently as every 30 seconds.
       5.6.8.2. DIFMS also has the capability to send positive and negative acknowledgement
       information back to DTS. DIFMS Report 7310-662 report contains negative (invalid
       record) and positive (valid record) acknowledgements. The report includes a cross
       reference showing the DIFMS error number, DTS error number, and the DIFMS error
       message.
   5.6.9. The program handles supplemental travel claims when the record has been finalized.
   The supplemental claim transactions are treated as an Action Code ‘C’ (Change) and the
   program automatically reopens the Travel Accrual record by changing the Status-Code from
   ‘3’ to ‘2’. These transactions process through DIFMS after reopening the orders.
       5.6.9.1. The program includes a seven-position field for the MS668D04 output file. This
       field contains the site UIC and two positions that are uniquely assigned as follows for Air
       Force sites: Hill =’HL’, Warner Robins = ‘WR’, and Tinker = ‘TI’. The site
       identification for the Air Force aids the GAFS-BL/BQ/DTS middleware in distributing
       the DIFMS output to the appropriate DTS site. For control purposes, a Sequence Control
       Number is being added to the trailer record on the MS668D04 file. The Sequence
       Number is a four position numeric field. A new internal file, MS668D07 maintains the
       Sequence Control Number.
       5.6.9.2. Internal processing for DIFMS in the area of Process Recovery and Funds
       Availability match the identical business rules that already existed in DIFMS Update
       Screen MS113P and DIFMS Program MS268P “Batch Travel Interface”.
       5.6.9.3. The program can process an Accounts Receivable transaction coming from the
       GAFS-BL/BQ/DTS interface process. This capability is provided by accepting an
       Accounts Receivable amount and a Transaction-Set-Purpose-Code on the incoming
       MS668D01 file. The functionality for processing the Accounts Receivable mirrors the
       Action Code ‘P’ (Post Overpayment) capability that currently exists in the Asset/Liability
       Update – Travel (MS113P). This change provides basic Debt Management capability
       within DIFMS in the DTS environment, and this change should not require manual
       intervention by the user to establish an Accounts Receivable within DIFMS.
5.7. Manual Travel Changes
   5.7.1. Users establish, amend, cancel, finalize or reopen a travel record in DIFMS Update
   Screen MS113P “Asset/Liability – Travel”. When travel amendment data is entered into
   DIFMS, the amended data overlays the original data records. Any inquiry performed after
   the update of this record only reflects the record as it was changed by the last amendment
   processed. DIFMS validates Travel Order upon entry into the DIFMS Update Screen
   MS113P. Data that needs to be finalized can be identified by reviewing the DIFMS Reports
   7310-680 “Asset Liability Transaction History” or 7310-645 “Asset/Liability Balances”.
   Users are able to traverse between the DIFMS Update Screen MS113P and the DIFMS
   Inquiry Screen MS013P “Travel Order Number Inquiry” without having to re-enter the
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                    125


  document number. Reference the DIFMS User Manual, Section H, Other Cost Function, for
  a user guide on the DIFMS Screen MS013P.
  5.7.2. Use action code ‘F’ to finalize a travel record and for problem records that have not
  cleared through the normal settlement process. Most settlements that come through cash
  automatically clear the accrual and ticket balances, even if they do not cleanly match. The
  primary exception of this would be ‘under-liquidations’ against a Permanent Change of
  Station (PCS) document or under-liquidations against documents with over 30 days of travel.
  The action code of ‘F’ can be used to write-off any individual balance or all balances.
  5.7.3. The action code of ‘C’ on DIFMS Update Screen MS113P is used to cancel and/or
  change the makeup of the order. In order to cancel a travel record using the ‘C’ function,
  there must be no expenses posted against the accruals. Cancellation sets the Authorized-
  Accrual field to zero including the “pieces” of the Authorized Accrual (Per Diem, POV,
  Other).
  5.7.4. The action code of ‘R’ on the MS113P screen is used to reopen an order to process
  additional charges or refunds on a Travel Accrual Record that has been settled and closed.
  5.7.5. Correction of duplicate document numbers for travel orders with different JONs and
  Shops must be done manually. Reference DIFMS report 7310-645 “Asset Liability Records”
  (Posting Code ‘2’ Section). It is important that these duplicates are corrected properly,
  because it has a financial impact between organizations. Travel expenses could be
  understated in one organization and overstated in another. Additionally, costs could be
  incurred and paid, but cannot be posted. This would affect the revenue recognized and
  payment received through billing.
  5.7.6. Travel Corrections
     5.7.6.1. The AFSC/FZR personnel enters corrections on the 7310-320 “Unallocated,
     Unmatched Details” and 7310-322 “Weekly Unallocated Details” using the DIFMS
     Update Screen MS132P “Unallocated Detail Error Correction”. Communication is
     important to prevent and clear these errors. Types of errors are listed below.
         5.7.6.1.1. Document number (DOC NBR) needs to be corrected. Common problems
         are fiscal year is incorrect, the order number is not set up in DIFMS, document
         number is not recognizable in cases of airline ticket, military flights (Air Mobility
         Command), Government Bill of Lading (GBL) is incorrect, and straight payments
         was incorrectly made.
         5.7.6.1.2. Disbursing Station Symbol Number (DSSN) or Accounting Station is not
         correct. Example is Robins ‘503000’.
         5.7.6.1.3. Property Accounting Activity (PAA) should be ‘7B’ for travel and ‘1K’ for
         advances issued or settled.
         5.7.6.1.4. Object Class (OBJ CLASS) must equal ‘210’.
         5.7.6.1.5. Transaction Type Code (TTC) is ‘2D’ for travel and ‘1K’ for advances.
         5.7.6.1.6. For document numbers that are set up twice, the DIFMS user adds the
         correct JON for settlement in the cost code field on the DIFMS Update Screen
         MS132P.
126                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


  5.7.7. An error message received may be “0591 Job Closed-TXN Date Cannot Be > close
  date or final billed”. If the ‘A’ JON is not final billed and the travel document is not closed
  then reopen the ‘A’ JON and clear the error. If the JON is final billed, and the travel
  document is in open status code ‘1’, then change the ‘A’ JON to the ‘X’ JON for it to
  process. If the travel document is closed, status code ‘3’ and the ‘A’ JON is final billed, then
  set the travel document up again under the ”X” JON and clear the error with the JON in the
  cost code field.
      5.7.7.1. Correct those document numbers that are set up twice under two different JONs.
      An example is the ‘X’ JON settled correctly (status code ‘3’) and an ‘A’ JON set up
      incorrectly in open status code ‘1’. The ‘A’ JON is closed and final billed. Two
      processes are available:
      5.7.7.2. Do a reverse billing and reopen the ‘A’ JON, then cancel or take the dollars
      down to zero and finalize.
      5.7.7.3. Change the ‘A’ JON to the ‘Y’ JON because DIFMS does not allow use of the
      ‘X’ JON again. Then cancel or take the dollars down to zero and finalize. A cost transfer
      would then need to be accomplished moving the credit from the ‘Y’ JON to the ‘X’ JON.
      5.7.7.4. For those documents that are set up under an ‘A’ JON that is closed and final
      billed (status code ‘3’) and need to be closed because it was cancelled, then the second
      process is used except the JON is changed to the ‘X’ JON and no transfer needs to be
      accomplished.
      5.7.7.5. For those orders where the expenditures are applied to the incorrect order, a zero
      batch transfer process should be used to move the costs from one order to another using
      the DIFMS Update Screen MS131P “Cash And Reject Correction”. This screen
      processes a negative cash posting to one record and a positive record (or multiple
      records) that add to $0 in total. Verify expenditures using Commander’s Resource
      Integration System (CRIS), Central Travel History Record (CTHR), Reserve Travel
      System (RTS), DIFMS Reports 7310-640 and 7310-C11.

   5.8.1. DIFMS Report 7310-605 “Schedule of Accruals” lists other (travel) costs accruals and
   creates the Accounts Payable in detail for the week and provides details for posting to the
   general ledger.
   5.8.2. DIFMS Report 7310-610 “Accrual Rejects” lists other (travel) accrual rejects due to a
   closed JON or an invalid JON/Shop combination.
   5.8.3. DIFMS Report 7310-615 “Outstanding Travel Advance” provides detail data
   concerning the aging of travel advances. It is broken down by permanent change of station
   (PCS) orders, as well as current ones. Report displays aging in 1-30, 31-90, 91-180, 181-
   360, and over 360 days increments.
   5.8.4. DIFMS Report 7310-640 “Asset/Liability Update” lists expenditures and changes to
   the Travel Asset/Liability Records in the section.
   5.8.5. DIFMS Report 7310-645 “Asset/Liability Records” provides a subsidiary ledger for
   Posting Code 2 - Travel.
   5.8.6. DIFMS Report 7310-C11 “Audit Trail” displays an audit trail for all DIFMS screens.
5.9. Balancing Procedures for Business Operations (Other) Cost
   5.9.1. Accounts Affected By Cash and Business Operations (Other) Cost. For comparison,
   use DIFMS Report 7310-645 “Asset Liability Balances” and the specified Journal Voucher
   Types from the DIFMS Report 7310-945 “Processed Journal Vouchers”. In lieu of using the
   current and prior DIFMS Report 7310-645 the current and prior DIFMS Report 7310-965
   “Automated Balancing” containing the DIFMS Report 7310-645 ‘subsidiary report totals’
   may be used.
   5.9.2. Balancing Of Accruals. Use the DIFMS Report 7310-605 “Schedule of Accruals” to
   ensure that the postings between the Cost and Asset/Liability Accounts are in synch. Verify
   that Debits equal Credits on DIFMS Report 7310-605 “Schedule of Accruals” ('SA' Journal
   Voucher). Verify that sum of cost postings (USSGL 4000-series accounts) is offset by sum
   of Asset/Liability postings (USSGL 1000 & 2000-series accounts).
   5.9.3. Direct Cost. Use DIFMS Report 7310-781 “Direct Costs by Shop within JON Current
   Cycle” and 7310-945 “Processed Journal Vouchers” for comparison and research.

                                        Chapter 6

                        ACCOUNT FOR FUNDS/MANAGE CASH

6.1. The Department of Defense has no cash but authority from the Department of the
Treasury to spend funds for the Air Force’s operations. This authority and all “cash”
accounts (GLACs 101040XX) in the Chart of Accounts are called Fund Balance with Treasury
(FBWT). However, for the purpose of simplicity, this chapter will refer to the FBWT as cash.
   6.1.1. Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) Financial Management (FM) and the Air
   Logistics Complexs (ALCs) organizations assist Defense Finance and Accounting Service
   (DFAS) to process transactions for cash and fund accountability. A matching commitment
   and obligation must be in the system, before disbursements can be posted to General
   Accounting and Finance System (GAFS-BL/BQ). For those commitments and obligations
   that are not available, DFAS must develop a follow-up process with the AFSC. During batch
   processing Defense Industrial Financial Management System (DIFMS) receives, edits,
   balances, validates, and stores cash data for processing. Records that do not pass edit,
   validation, and balancing are rejected for subsequent correction by DFAS with assistance
   from the AFSC.
   6.1.2. GAFS-BL/BQ is the AF cash accounting system for Treasury reporting. DIFMS
   receives cash transactions (receipts and disbursements) from GAFS-BL/BQ via the DFAS
   Integration Engine (DFAS-IE).6.1.2.1.         Air Force Intra-Government Payment and
   Collections (IPAC) detail billings come from AF systems: Financial Inventory Accounting
   and Billing System (FIABS-D035J), AF Integrated Logistics System – Supply (ILS-S), and
   Standard Material Accounting System (SMAS-H118). These detailed billings are compared
   to summary disbursements recorded in GAFS-BL/BQ. The DFAS-IE creates the summary
   and detail IPAC billings based on this reconciled data. DIFMS can process an entire month
   of IPAC billing data into a single run of the DIFMS Run Stream/Program MS200J/MS202P
   “Daily Disbursing Officer Voucher Cash Input” without waiting additional cycles for the
   “wraparound” process to bring through additional cash batches.
       6.1.2.1. Non-IPAC disbursements and miscellaneous collections come via the DFAS-IE
       from GAFS-BL/BQ, and then they are posted to DIFMS based on commitments,
       obligations, and receipts that are in DIFMS and GAFS-BL/BQ.

       R, Volume 4, Chapter 2
6.2. Collections
   6.2.1. All collections are recorded via cash receipts (CR) Journal Vouchers (JV) as shown on
   DIFMS Report 7310-335 “Cash Receipts Register”. This report is consistent in format to the
   DIFMS Report 7310-340 “Cash Disbursements Register”.
   6.2.2. DIFMS provides an Accounts Receivable (A/R) file to GAFS-BL/BQ each time a
   billing cycle is run. This record must be in GAFS-BL/BQ before the collection can be made.
   The DFAS Integration Engine (DFAS-IE) has an 18-position document number that begins
   with the DIFMS Type Transaction Code (TTC) of ‘8T’. The last seven digits are the bill
   number from the DIFMS accounts receivable. DIFMS interprets this 18-digit document
   number as a six-digit Property Accounting Activity (PAA) and a 12-digit cost code. For a
   collection transaction to liquidate a receivable in DIFMS, the TTC, bill number, and amount
   must match an un-liquidated bill as shown on DIFMS Report 7310-865 “Unliquidated Bills”.
   The presence of the Sponsor Order Number on this report makes it easier for the user to
   research outstanding and overage receivables. DIFMS Program MS355P uses the type
   customer code from the bill number record in determining whether to report a receivable as
   “Government” or “Public”. Successful bill liquidations are shown on the DIFMS Report
   7310-630 “Liquidated Bills/Customers Order Updates”. Unsuccessful bill liquidations are
   suspended to the DIFMS Report 7310-322 “Weekly Unallocated Details”.
   6.2.3. These collections are made based on the receipt of checks. These cash collections can
   include vendor overpayments, employee indebtedness, etc.
       6.2.3.1. When the indebtedness is first known, the accounts receivable record should be
       established to allow the AFSC to monitor the collection of the indebtedness. If the
       indebtedness is not known until the check is received, the A/R should be established at
       that time via the DIFMS Screen MS112P “Asset Liability Update” as a posting code ‘6’
       record so the cash collection transaction that is received from the DFAS-IE has a record
       to match against. Preferably, establish the Accounts Receivable (A/R) record at the same
       time the collection voucher is prepared. If the A/R record is not established or the cash
       collection cannot find a matching A/R record, the transaction is suspended to DIFMS
       Report 7310-322.
       6.2.3.2. The following process is used to liquidate the A/R record established above.
       The liquidation is caused by the cash collection transaction received. The AFSC
       forwards the check it has received to DFAS with a collection voucher. Included in the
       data received is the Job Order Number (JON) and shop to be credited. The collection
       action takes place in GAFS-BL/BQ. DFAS assigns a collection voucher number. The
       cash transaction comes to DIFMS from GAFS-BL/BQ via the DFAS-IE. DIFMS
       validates that the batch is balanced and that basic DIFMS edit criteria are met. Once the
       basic DIFMS validations are met, the cash transaction looks for a match on the DOC-
       JOB-SHOP records.
   6.2.4. Private party (partnering) advances are collected prior to induction of workload.
       6.2.4.1. A DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, is prepared to collect the advance
       citing the Customer Order Number (CON) associated with the advance. If there is a
 132                                                           AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


       delay in establishing the CON, the collection will error in the DFAS-IE and will appear
       on the Unallocated Cash report.
       6.2.4.2. When funding from partners is moved from CON to CON, Cost Accounting uses
       the DIFMS Screen MS131P “Cash and Reject Correction Update” to realign the funds.
       This moves the “Available to Bill” to the “Advance from Customer” on each CON. This
       is a “zero batch” transaction.
6.3. On-Line Intra-Governmental Payment & Collection (IPAC) Billing
   6.3.1. IPAC is no-check-drawn payments made by one activity for another activity. One of
   the big players in the IPAC system is supply management activities, such as Defense
   Logistics Agency, who sells weapon system parts, supplies, and other materials and goods to
   organic depot maintenance and other customers. The big advantage of the IPAC system is
   that selling activities get reimbursed and buying activities get charged sooner for the
   materials. IPAC buys for material used in organic depot maintenance are through both Air
   Force and other government sources. The material due for government material buys are
   input to Naval Air Systems Command Industrial Material Management System (NIMMS) or
   Automated Bill of Material (ABOM) by the AFSC.
       6.3.1.1. AF IPAC billings can come from three AF sources: FIABS (purchased from
       WRRS-D035K), ILS-S (common supply items), and SMAS (medical-dental).
       6.3.1.2. These three sources send detailed billings to the DFAS-IE that in turn converts
       to detailed IPAC billings as stated in paragraph 0. These disbursements are posted in
       DIFMS via ‘CD’ JV as shown on DIFMS Report 7310-340 “Cash Disbursements
       Register”. Additional details for these transactions can be found on DIFMS Reports
       7310-310 “DSA/GSA Summary Bills-Register 6”, 7310-311 “Statement of Inter-
       Departmental Billing Transactions Charges” and 7310-462 “Processed Material Bills”.
       These detailed billings attempt to match Accounts Payable (A/P) (receipts) or A/R (turn-
       ins) records in DIFMS that were created in NIMMS. Those that match quantity, price,
       and document number liquidate the A/P or A/R. Those that do not match create a
       Material In Transit (MIT) or unmatched government material bill.
   6.3.2. Supply agencies within DoD can provide summary and detail IPAC billings through
   the Defense Automated Addressing System (DAAS). GAFS-BL/BQ receives these billings
   and based on the fund code distributes to the applicable system. DFAS balances the
   summary and detailed bills and FTP the file to DIFMS.
   6.3.3. (OC-ALC Only) Navy material buys are input directly into the Navy supply system
   by the Navy Liaison Office at the Oklahoma City AFSC site at the requisition level. The
   payment is made at the summary level based on the detail and summary IPAC billings
   received.
       6.3.3.1. The summary payment is made in GAFS-BL/BQ to an ‘OY’ Miscellaneous
       Obligation Reimbursement Document (MORD) established in GAFS-BL/BQ by the
       AFSC. This payment is interfaced to DIFMS via the DFAS-IE.
       6.3.3.2. The amount of the summary payment is distributed to the appropriate JONs by
       personnel in the AFSC Cost Accounting, and the summary payment is at the detail
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     133


      requisition level by a Cost Adjustment input via DIFMS Screen MS144P “Cost
      Adjustment Update”.
6.4. Commercial Material
   6.4.1. Each AFSC is responsible for retrieving the commercial material commitments
   document from the Automated Business Service System (ABSS-H021) and input of
   commitment into GAFS-BL/BQ and Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Industrial
   Material Management System (NIMMS).
   6.4.2. Material obligation records with ‘MU’ in the first two positions of the Cost Code field
   must be manually input into NIMMS by the designated office in the AFSC.
   6.4.3. Industrial Prime Vendor (IPV) and Business System Modernization – Energy (BSME)
   (Fuel). These disbursements originate at summary level in GAFS-BL/BQ against multiple
   MORDs and the payment is sent to DIFMS via the DFAS-IE. If a matching accounts
   payable is found, the bill liquidates the A/P. If no matching record is found, the transaction
   suspends to the DIFMS Reports 7310-322 “DIFMS Weekly Unallocated Details” or 7310-
   484 “DIFMS Aged Unmatched Bills”.
   6.4.4. The solution for receipting IPV Commercial, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA),
   schedule/non-schedule of items and infrastructure and task-order labor, as well as the DLA
   surcharge is listed below. This method allows the AFSC to post expenses (receipts) as the
   material is received instead of when DFAS pays the bill.
      6.4.4.1. AFSC Cost Accountant gets invoice information three times per month
      (approximately on the 5th, 12th, and 20th of the month) and provides a copy of the GAFS-
      BL/BQ Bill with the DIFMS/NIMMS document number (e.g., MORD number).
      6.4.4.2. AFSC Cost Accountant inputs a receipt into NIMMS for each invoice, causing a
      General and Administrative (G&A) expense and an accounts payable in DIFMS.
      6.4.4.3. Prior to end of month, the AFSC Cost Accountant develops information to cost
      transfer the G&A expense to production overhead by organization, as is shown elsewhere
      in this Chapter.
      6.4.4.4. DFAS can then disburse the MORDs. DFAS processes vouchers that send
      billings to DIFMS.
   6.4.5. Other commercial material disbursements originate at summary level in GAFS-
   BL/BQ against a Government-Wide Purchase Card (GPC). If a matching accounts payable is
   found, the bill liquidates the A/P. If no matching record is found the transaction suspends to
   the DIFMS Reports 7310-322 “DIFMS Weekly Unallocated Details” or 7310-484 “DIFMS
   Aged Unmatched Bills”.
6.5. Business Operations (Other)
   6.5.1. A commitment is established in DIFMS, which is the initial accounting for the
   contingent liability.   The commitment eventually becomes an obligation, accrued
   expenditure-unpaid and then paid for that document. The commitment should be input into
   DIFMS before it is input to other systems, such as GAFS-BL/BQ. This validates the Job
   Order Number (JON) and shop cited on the document and ensures the uniqueness of the
   document number and cost code relationship.
 134                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


   6.5.2. Service Contracts
       6.5.2.1. The AFSC is responsible for retrieving the documents from ABSS and input of
       commitment into GAFS-BL/BQ and DIFMS.
       6.5.2.2. The responsible AFSC office provides the documents to DFAS who inputs into
       GAFS-BQ/BL. The DFAS-IE sends the obligation through an interface from GAFS-
       BL/BQ to DIFMS
       6.5.2.3. AFSC cost accounting is responsible for accruing costs in DIFMS on all
       documents, except “ST” which will be systematically accrued once established
       6.5.2.4. Cash transactions fed to DIFMS via the DFAS-IE must match to an accrual or
       accounts payable value in DIFMS equal to or greater than the payment. DIFMS edits and
       validates cash transactions based on Purchase Order Number (PON), task, Accounting
       Classification Reference Number (ACRN), cost code, and dollar amount. The cash
       transactions are posted by ‘CD’ JV as shown on DIFMS Report 7310-340 “DIFMS Cash
       Disbursement Register”. Transactions that pass DIFMS edits and validations are shown
       on DIFMS Report 7310-680 “Asset Liability Transaction History”. Transactions that do
       not pass DIFMS edits and validations are shown on DIFMS Report 7310-320 daily
       “DIFMS Unallocated and Unmatched Details” and if not worked, it will appear on the
       7310-322 weekly “DIFMS Weekly Unallocated Details”.
       6.5.2.5. Processing for the Capital Investment Program (CIP) includes the same steps
       above with an additional requirement that the cumulative payments do not exceed the
       allocated budget authority.
       6.5.2.6. The AFSC is issued an annual military assessment, and an outgoing funding
       document is issued for the assessment. The payment is recorded in GAFS-BL/BQ and
       sent to DIFMS via the DFAS-IE.
       6.5.2.7. The payment for worker’s compensation is initiated by the supervisor (see
       AFMCI 21-136), paid in GAFS-BL/BQ, and sent to DIFMS via DFAS-IE.
   6.5.3. GAFS-BL/BQ Travel orders are interfaced from DTS into GAFS-BL/BQ and then
   from GAFS-BL/BQ to DIFMS via the IE.
6.6. Unallocated Cash Processing
   6.6.1. Use DIFMS Screen MS132P “Unallocated DTL Error Correction Update” to correct
   single transactions. This may also require the use of “zero batches” to clear the records
   correctly. Use the DIFMS Screen MS135P “Multiple Unallocated Disbursing Officer
   Voucher (DOV) Detail Error Correction Update” for processing corrections to Doc-Job-Shop
   transactions. Users have the flexibility to split a correction up into pieces that could include
   an ‘8P’ transaction.
       6.6.1.1. Using the DIFMS Reports 7310-320 “DIFMS Unallocated and Unmatched
       Details” or 7310-322 “DIFMS Weekly Unallocated Details”, AFSC cost accounting
       personnel identify and take the necessary actions to correct the unallocated and
       unmatched transactions, using the DIFMS Screen MS132P “Unallocated Detail Error
       Correction Update”.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                      135


     6.6.1.2. If a services type or capital purchase record is not in the DIFMS database, AFSC
     cost accounting personnel research and retrieve the necessary information in the related
     legacy system or GAFS-BL/BQ to validate the appropriate commitment and obligation
     balances. Once validated, the proper adjustments are made via DIFMS Screen MS112P
     “Asset Liability Update”. Then the necessary adjustments are made via the DIFMS
     Screen MS132P “Unallocated Detail Error Correction Update”, if required, i.e.
     discrepancy in the document number, JON, cost code, ACRN, etc. Corrected records
     appear the next day on the DIFMS Report 7310-321 “Corrected Unallocated/Unmatched
     Details” with a full display of the results of “material cash return” transactions allowing
     identification of the transactions.
        6.6.1.2.1. For the DOV these include: Correction Attempt Successful - Not Posted,
        Multiple Unallocated Correction Attempt Successful – Not Posted, Correction
        Attempt Successful – Posted, and Multiple Unallocated Correction Attempt
        Successful – Posted for each bill type. Transactions in the correction attempt
        successful - posted section are reflected on the JV at the end of this report. These are
        transactions in which cash has been posted in a previous cycle (the successful
        correction attempt; successful is relieving the 'unallocated' cash accounts).
        Transactions in the Correction Attempt Successful - Not Posted section are reflected
        on either cash receipt or disbursement registers, because they represent 'current cycle'
        cash transactions and not part of the JV on this report.
     6.6.1.3. Some transactions that come from the cash files into the IE are error corrections
     done at DFAS or other organizations. These transactions are normally called “Net To
     Zero” transactions and they have no financial impact. The AFSC receives the error
     correction as part of the cash file. The net to zero transactions are both a debit and credit
     of equal amounts. These transactions must be grouped for easy audit and tracking
     purposes. These transactions must be processed so they have no impact on the monthly
     financial statements. Procedures to clean up Net to Zero transactions must be scheduled
     so that all transactions are processed and internal controls are implemented prior to end of
     month, so that financial errors are minimized. (Examples of problems include: One
     legged transactions that just process a debit or credit, or wrong dollar values that create
     variances.) Internal controls on monitoring must be designed at each AFSC so that Net to
     Zero transactions will have no financial impact. These transactions normally will show
     up on the 7310-322 report “DIFMS Weekly Unallocated Details”. A suggested method
     of how to process these transactions follows:
        6.6.1.3.1. Use DIFMS Screen MS132P “Unallocated Detail Error Correction
        Update” to clear DIFMS transactions listed on the “Net0 QLP” tab in the DIFMS
        Report 7310-322 “DIFMS Weekly Unallocated Details” worksheet. A person with
        DIFMS Screen MS112P “Asset Liability Update” must set up a record using posting
        code ‘5’ and setting the authorized amount higher than what is cleared (DOC NBR =
        NETZEROWRITEOFF, JON = Y65690998000, SHOP = MXXXX). Then, using
        DIFMS Screen MS132P, inquire for the error serial number from the DIFMS Report
        7310-322. Enter the data elements necessary to process the correction:
            6.6.1.3.1.1. DOC NBR: always type NETZEROWRITEOFF
            6.6.1.3.1.2. ACRN: always type AA
136                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


             6.6.1.3.1.3. PAA: blanked out if have data
             6.6.1.3.1.4. COST CODE: always type SU??XXXX0000 (Note: ?? = fiscal
             year)
             6.6.1.3.1.5. TASK/PROJ NBR must be blanked out
             6.6.1.3.1.6. ACTION CD: change from I to C (for change)
             6.6.1.3.1.7. CLICK ON ENTER (after completing above)
         6.6.1.3.2. After posting the NETZEROWRITEOFF to DIFMS Screen MS132P and
         after the next weekly run of DIFMS Program MS260P “Process Disbursing Officer
         Vouchers”, use the DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS015P “Asset Liability Doc Job Shop
         Data Inquiry” to verify the amounts equal zero. To find the transactions enter the
         document number, JON, and RCC. If there’s a variance, then use the DIFMS Report
         7310-680 “Transaction History” to find the transactions that did not zero. Use the
         DIFMS Screen MS131P “DIFMS Cash and Reject Correction Update” to
         reverse/correct erroneous posting to NETZEROWRITEOFF. Data for the correction
         is on the DIFMS Report 7310-322 “DIFMS Weekly Unallocated Details” used
         previously.
      6.6.1.4. DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS017P “Asset/Liability Liquidations History” provides
      much easier access to the liquidation history data currently only visible on the 7310-680
      “DIFMS Asset/Liability Transaction History” report. With the variety of access options
      (data element combinations for data access) available, the users should be able to locate
      quickly the information they need.
         6.6.1.4.1. DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS017P provides access and visibility to
         liquidation data associated with Document-Job-Shop (Contractual Services) and
         Travel records to view on-line. The data viewed is similar to what is displayed on the
         DIFMS Report 7310-680 in the ‘Liquidations’ section. The user has alternate search
         capability by Document-Number, PON, Task, ACRN, CLIN, Cost Code, JON, DOV
         Number, and Batch Control Number. The Document Number and PON are indexed
         to provide a more efficient search. If the search criteria yield more than 100 records,
         a message is shown to ask the user to redefine the search.
         6.6.1.4.2. A database table, DIFMS_LIQD_HSTY, stores the data that is being
         inquired on. This table is initialized using the one-time DIFMS Program MS912P
         “Initialize Cash Liquidation History Information” which takes the MS258D03 file
         and translates the data into the DIFMS Oracle database. For sites wishing to
         maximize the volume of historical data, use guidance in the DIFMS users’ manual for
         monthly, quarterly, and year-end procedures. Also annual direction published by
         AFMC Financial Management Directorate (AFMC/FM) and DFAS Columbus Center
         (DFAS-CO) for any specific processing procedures prior to the fiscal year end purge.
  6.6.2. Basic Research for the Other Cost/Cash Process:
      6.6.2.1. There is a requirement for a match to the correct document number.
      6.6.2.2. For Business Operations (Other) Cost transactions, the requirement is for
      document number, task, ACRN, Contractual Other Code (COC), and Cost Code to match
      to a DOC-JOB-SHOP record.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     137


     6.6.2.3. For commercial material buys, the approach is covered in the Technical Service
     Organization's website: https://t6800.csd.disa.mil/DifmsPortal/index.php. Please click
     on the appropriate tab for NIMMS, and then on the current production release.
     Additional information can also be obtained from the AFMCI 21-130, Depot
     Maintenance                Materiel               Control:               http://www.e-
     publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMCI21-130.pdf
  6.6.3. The detailed IPAC billings that find no due (or Obligation) report as unmatched
  government bills on DIFMS Report 7310-340 “Cash Disbursement Register”. AFSC cost
  accounting records the due and/or receipt on the material due record in NIMMS for the
  Material In-Transit (MIT) and Unmatched Government Bills transactions that have no
  accounts payable and/or obligation.
     6.6.3.1. Most corrections are made via NIMMS screens. Obligations are established
     using NIMMS Screen MN012P “Establishment for Military Standard Requisitioning and
     Issue Procedure (MILSTRIP) Requisitions”. Receipts are recorded using the NIMMS
     screen MN031P “Receipts”. After the next material and cash updates, the MIT and
     Unmatched Billing transactions should match to the Material Dues and liquidate the
     Accounts Payables that were established.
     6.6.3.2. The results of processing delayed receipt/obligations that successfully match off
     would appear on the DIFMS Report 7310-461 “Transactions Clearing Requisition Status”
     under the ‘MU’ JV type.
  6.6.4. Cash liquidations for material transactions containing Contract Line Item Numbers
  (CLIN) and Sub Line Item Numbers (SLIN) or ACRNs should successfully process
  automatically in DIFMS through matching for material transactions in the same manner that
  it is done for liquidations of Document Job Shop transactions. This matching is handled by
  using several DIFMS Update Screens and related DIFMS Programs: MS131P “Cash and
  Reject Correction”, MS132P “Unallocated Detail Error Correction”, MS135P “Multiple
  Unallocated Error Correction”, MS200P “Daily DOV Cash Input”, MS214P “Finalize and
  Re-cycle Cash Data”, and MS260P “Process Disbursing Office Vouchers”.
  6.6.5. DIFMS Program MS260P relieves the Public Receivables 131042A USSGL account.
  The budgetary postings for Receivables (4251 and 4252 USSGL series) migrate to Public
  (‘42’). DIFMS Report 7310-865 “Un-liquidated Bills” reflects FMS Bill Numbers as Public
  (131042A) receivables.
  6.6.6. Acceptable variance parameters are established in the DIFMS System Info Record that
  allows the cash and payable transactions to match within acceptable criteria. If the difference
  exceeds that value, the cash transaction for correction is included in DIFMS Report 7310-495
  “Material Mismatched”. Those items on DIFMS Report 7310-495 have either purchase or
  quantity differences in excess of the acceptable criteria. To correct this error, AFSC cost
  accounting adjusts the A/P in NIMMS Screen MN031P “Receipts”. This would normally be
  worked by “reversing” the original receipt using MN031P and reprocessing the corrected
  receipt also using NIMMS Screen MN031P. Another option exists to use the DIFMS Update
  Screen MS185P “Excessive Purchase Variance” for cases where quantities match and
  amounts are excessive. In cases where amounts match and quantities differ, use DIFMS
  Update Screen MS181P “Mismatched”. See Chapter 4 for additional information.
 138                                                             AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


   6.6.7. Each AFSC reviews weekly cash balance and detail from GAFS-BQ, the DIFMS trial
   balance (7310-935 or 7310-325) reports to determine (1) if the summary (trial balance
   account) agrees to GAFS-BQ total and detail, and (2) unallocated cash transactions (7310-
   320, 7310-322) reports). Any discrepancies that are not in the DFAS-IE are researched by
   the cost accounting office. Once the necessary correction is determined, cost accounting
   personnel use applicable update screens to correct cash errors.
       6.6.7.1. DIFMS balances, edits, and validates the DOV summary and details. DIFMS
       also balances, edits, and validates interdepartmental (IPAC) bills. Rejects from these edit
       routines are listed on the DIFMS Report 7310-305 “Rejected Details and Summary
       Records”. DFAS makes corrections via the DIFMS Screen MS131P “Cash and Reject
       Correction Update” using Part I and Part II of this report, correcting the field in error,
       indicated by (*). Those records corrected successfully do not appear on the next day’s
       DIFMS Report 7310-305 “DIFMS Rejected Details and Summary Records”.
   6.6.8. The cash subsystem prevents unallocated general ledger accounts from shifting
   between the two ‘Unallocated Cash’ USSGL accounts for collections (131041D and
   131042G) when the Property Accounting Activity (PAA) field is changed on a correction
   action. The original Unallocated Cash USSGL account is stored on the Unallocated DOV
   Detail record in the existing record stream, and when the unallocated transaction first enters
   the system is the record is posted by the DIFMS Program MS283P “Post Unallocated Cash”.
       6.6.8.1. After a correction has occurred on either the Unallocated Detail Error Correction
       Update (MS132P) or the Multiple Unallocated Detail Error Correction Update
       (MS135P), this USSGL account number is carried forward on the correction records.
       Whenever the PAA field on a correction action has been changed between a ‘Billing’
       (Unallocated Cash USSGL account 131041D) and ‘Non Billing’ (Unallocated Cash
       USSGL account 131042G) cash disbursement, retention of the original USSGL account
       number allows the DIFMS Program MS260P “Process Disbursing Office Vouchers” to
       reverse the original Unallocated USSGL account correctly. In addition, if the record is
       again rejected in the DIFMS Program MS260P, it posts out of the “old” and into the
       “new” unallocated USSGL account based on the latest PAA value. The DIFMS Program
       MS385P “Report Corrected Unallocated Cash” displays records that take this course of
       action through the DIFMS Report 7310-321 “Corrected Unallocated and Unmatched
       Details”.
6.7. Cash postings to the United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL)
   6.7.1. There are three update reports in the Cash processing which contain the details for the
   cash updates. The manual JV is also used in the cash liquidation processing.
   6.7.2. DIFMS Report 7310-340 “Cash Disbursement Register (Journal Voucher Type =
   CD)” contains the updates received from the disbursements and collections made in GAFS-
   BL/BQ and passed to DIFMS via the DFAS-IE. Transactions for ‘material and other’ based
   on payment for IPAC and commercial material and other purchases:
       6.7.2.1. Debit 4901xx Expended Authority Unpaid
       6.7.2.2. Credit 4902xx Expended Authority Paid
       6.7.2.3. Debit 2110xx Accounts Payable
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                   139


      6.7.2.4. Credit 101040Bx Funds Disbursed
   6.7.3. DIFMS Report 7310-335 “Cash Receipts Register (Journal Voucher Type = CR)”
   contains the updates made from collections for DIFMS income billings and other collection
   actions. Transactions for DIFMS billings based on A/R recorded in GAFS-BL/BQ:
      6.7.3.1. Debit 4901xx Expended Authority Unpaid
      6.7.3.2. Credit 4902xx Expended Authority Paid
      6.7.3.3. Debit 42524x Reimbursements and Other Income Earned - Collected
      6.7.3.4. Credit 42514x Reimbursements and Other Income Earned Receivables
      6.7.3.5. Debit 101040Ax Funds Collected
      6.7.3.6. Credit 1310xxx Accounts Receivable
   6.7.4. Other collections are documented in DIFMS Report 7310-321 “Corrected Unallocated
   and Unmatched Details (Journal voucher type = CU)”. When transactions go to Unallocated
   or Unmatched, cash is posted with an offset to either A/P or A/R. The entries would be as
   stated above for disbursements versus collections, with entries to the unallocated accounts.
   When the transactions clear the unallocated or unmatched status, the transaction amounts
   move from unallocated A/R and A/P.
6.8. Research Procedures for Cash Imbalance
   6.8.1. Step 1: Verify all transactions entered in DIFMS. Obtain the total dollar value of
   cash transactions from the DFAS field site. Using the DIFMS Report 7310-325 “DIFMS
   Valid Cash Vouchers”, compare the total cash to the subtotals in the Valid Cash Vouchers
   Section, and the Unallocated Cash Vouchers Section. Research differences, in coordination
   with the DFAS field site, to determine causes and take corrective action (see subsequent
   steps).
   6.8.2. Step 2: Use the DIFMS Reports 7310-335 “Cash Receipts Register” and 7310-340
   “Cash Disbursement Register” to verify valid cash postings are correct by comparing the
   total debits and credits for Receivables, Payables, Liabilities, and Operating Expenses.
   Compare the total debits and credits to the total of valid cash vouchers from the DIFMS
   Report 7310-325.

Table 6.1. Verifying Valid Cash Postings
 Debits (USSGL accounts)                        Credits (USSGL accounts)
   - Account Receivable                            - Account Receivable
   - Advances                                      - Advances
   - Account Payable                               - Account Payable
   - Other Accrued Liability                       - Other Accrued Liability
   - Operating Expenses                            - Operating Expenses
   6.8.3. Step 3: Use the DIFMS Report 7310-320 “Unallocated and Unmatched Details” (new
   processing section), to verify unallocated postings are correct. Calculate the total of the
   following USSGL accounts:          Unallocated Disbursements, (211042xx); Unallocated
   Collections, Government (131041xx); and Unallocated Collections, Commercial (131042xx).

   Compare this total to the total of unallocated cash vouchers from the DIFMS Report 7310-
   325 “DIFMS Valid Cash Vouchers”.
   6.8.4. For reference, below are the DIFMS cash reports and postings to respective USSGL
   accounts.                    Go             to        the        following          link:

6.9. Monthly Manual Journal Vouchers Posted to Balance DIFMS and Treasury Cash
   6.9.1. GAFS-BL/BQ is the Treasury “checkbook” for cash in AF. Reconciliation is required
   each month to bring the DIFMS and Treasury balances into line.
   6.9.2. The GAFS-BL/BQ HAF-ACF (M) 7113, Report of Disbursement and Collection,
   requires that a journal voucher be posted in DIFMS to bring the cash balances in GAFS-
   BL/BQ and DIFMS into agreement. The items adjusted in this JV are generally those items
   that are suspended in the DFAS-IE, pending correction. DFAS posts the JV as a reversing
   manual JV at month end. Refer to Chapter 9 for additional information.
   6.9.3. The GAFS-BL/BQ HAF-ACF (M) 7136, Air Force Working Capital Funds Cash Data
   Report, requires that a journal voucher be posted in DIFMS to bring the GAFS-BL/BQ and
   Treasury balances into agreement. DFAS-CO prepares a cash worksheet that the General
   Ledger Accounts use to produce the 7136 report. Refer to Chapter 9 for additional
   information.

                                             Chapter 7

                               TRANSFER COST AND ADJUST

7.1. Introduction
   7.1.1. Cost transfers in Defense Industrial Financial Management System (DIFMS) are
   performed in multiple sub-systems. The Labor subsystem processes detailed labor transfers
   at the employee level. The Business Operations (Other) Cost subsystem processes contract
   labor (DOCAT) transfers. The Cost Summary subsystem processes cost transfers between
   performing and benefiting/owning cost centers by Job Order Number (JON) and percentage
   (pro-rate) cost transfers. This subsystem also merges, summarizes, and reports on labor,
   material, contractual, depreciation, and other miscellaneous costs by shop, job order number,
   and type of cost.
   7.1.2. DIFMS Report 7310-221 “Indirect JON Transfer Status” reflects the transfer status of
   indirect job order numbers. Part I lists those jobs with a transfer indicator of ‘1’ that
   designates straight transfers. Part II lists those jobs with transfer indicators of ‘3’, ‘4’, ‘5’, or
   ‘7’; which designates prorated transfers. The transfer job listed in this section of the report
   has a corresponding PRORATE-TRANSFER-RECORD established; while those jobs listed
   in Part IV of the report do not. Part III lists all non-transfer jobs.

7.2. Manual Cost Transfers
   7.2.1. Cost transfers occasionally need to be performed to get labor, material, and other costs
   to the correct JON/Shop combination. Adjustments can be made for labor hours, labor costs,
   material costs, contractual and business operations costs, or applied overhead when
   extenuating circumstances arise. Manual transfers of costs should be kept to a minimum by
   shop floor discipline. Cost transfers may only be done when documentation confirms the
   need to perform a transfer in order to charge costs (such as material and labor) to the proper
   JON and shop. Cost transfers are submitted to the AFSC Cost Accounting office for final
   review and approval as well as input of the transaction on the DIFMS MS144P “Cost
   Adjustment Update” screen.
7.2.2. Specific types of manual cost transfers include, but not limited to: Government-wide
Purchase Card (GPC), Industrial Prime Vendor (IPV), in-house Capital Investment Program
(CIP), Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) credit transfers between direct
Resource Control Center (RCC) to the Administrative Overhead Center (AOC), Foreign Military
Sales (FMS) cost share on ‘B’ JONs, partnering JONs (Reimbursement Code W), and travel
performed on multiple direct JONs.
   7.2.3. A cost transfer is allowable when the following conditions are present: (1) JON is
   open; (2) RCC is valid and active; (3) transfer of direct cost is no more than incurred cost
 142                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


   (does not create negative position); (4) the JON is not restricted to the type of cost attempting
   to be transferred; (5) Type Charge Code (TCC) is the same for transfer out and transfer in
   (such as labor to labor); (6) for each TCC the net transfer amount nets to zero, except retro
   hours and applied overhead (see list of TCC exceptions below); and (7) if transferring
   contractual or business operations cost (TCC = ’P’ or ‘Q’) the Contractual Other Code
   (COC) must match (such as travel to travel).

Table 7.1. Type Charge Code (TCC)
TCC      Description
H        Civilian Holiday Retro Labor Hours/Costs Funded
L        Civilian Regular Retro Labor Hours
N        Night Differential
O        Civilian Overtime Retro Labor hours/Costs Funded
W        Production Expense Applied Funded
X        Production Expense Applied Unfunded Civilian
Y        Production Expense Applied Unfunded Officer
Z        Production Expense Applied Unfunded Enlisted
1        General Expense Applied Funded
2        General Expense Applied Unfunded Civilian
3        General Expense Applied Unfunded Officer
4        General Expense Applied Unfunded Enlisted
   7.2.4. Sometimes it is necessary to create a manual JV between Expense Accounts and Asset
   or Liability Accounts. Since the JV affects General Ledger accounts, the transactions do not
   change the subsidiary balances in DIFMS, and the details are not provided to DDS for
   historical purposes. The alternative to processing a manual JV is to do a manual cost
   adjustment to keep the subsidiary ledger(s) in balance with the corresponding General Ledger
   account(s). One side of the cost adjustment is to an expense account, which creates the
   appropriate history records for DDS. The other side is to a pseudo "USSGL"-JON (a W
   followed by the USSGL account number), which allows the proper postings via a ‘CX’ JV as
   shown on the DIFMS Reports 7310-960 “Cost Adjustments by Expense Account” and 7310-
   905 “Cost Adjustments”. Careful analysis must be done before deciding which type of
   adjustment is to be done.
       7.2.4.1. Use DIFMS Screen MS151P, “Indirect Job Order Update”, to create a "GLA"
       JON linked to Asset or Liability GLA account. This screen allows users to input or
       update indirect job order data for production expense, general expense, or for leave job
       orders. Note: System sets Status Code to 1 (Open) and Job Open Date to the current
       date.
   7.2.5. Automated JVs are generated when adjustments transfer costs between direct and
   indirect or from production to general. No JV is generated when costs are transferred within
   direct, production, or general expense accounts. The JV created by this program is identified
   as ‘CX’ on DIFMS Report 7310-960. DIFMS Report 7310-905 shows the details of each
   cost adjustment processed the previous day.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                       143


7.3. Automated Straight Transfers (PMEL)
   7.3.1. DIFMS Program MS272P “Straight Transfers” allows indirect costs to be passed from
   one shop to another. The system-generated straight transfers result in the appropriate
   USSGL accounts being posted. A journal voucher type ‘CT’ is generated as identified on the
   DIFMS Report 7310-705 “Cost Transfers”.
   7.3.2. A transfer indicator of ‘1’ designates straight transfers. Also, fill out the ‘Benefiting
   Shop/Cost Center Transfer To’ (BEN-SHOP-CC-XREF-TO) with the owning shop. Costs
   incurred transfer 100% from the performing to the benefiting (owning) shop.
   7.3.3. It may also be desirable to restrict the PMEL JON to a specific performing shop or a
   range of shops by using DIFMS Screen MS158P “Authorized Shops Update”. If MS158P is
   used, also set the shop indicator on MS151P to a ‘2’. Authorized shops can be inquired on
   DIFMS Screen MS058P “Authorized Shop Inquiry”.
7.4. Percentage Transfers
   7.4.1. These transfers are based on CPBM rates and transfer percentages.
   7.4.2. For all costs captured in G&A and production overhead shops, it is necessary that
   costs be transferred to the benefiting direct shops on a percentage basis. In DIFMS, this task
   is accomplished through its percentage transfer process.
   7.4.3. The process involves establishing overhead cost pools and determining the proper
   allocation of the costs to the benefiting Resource Control Centers (RCC). After the shop
   relationship is determined, an appropriate percentage must be determined to transfer
   overhead costs to the appropriate direct cost center.
   7.4.3.1. Percentage cost transfers are calculated in the CPBM Budget Target Module (BTM).
   CPBM system administrator transmits the transfer percentages via FTP to DIFMS through
   the MS683D01 file. The DIFMS scheduler must have MS683P “Customer Order Number
   Update Interface” executed to process this file into DIFMS. Once the file has processed
   correctly, DIFMS Report 7310-260, "Transfer Percentage Update" and 7310-261, "Shop Cost
   Center Rates Update" reflects the transferred data on the following day. These reports will
   be produced when a change has been made. If there were an error in processing, it would be
   reflected as an error in Part II, Invalid.
      7.4.3.2. In special cases, the authorized user may also directly establish transfer
      percentages by manually entering transfer percent input into DIFMS Screen MS174P
      “Transfer Percentage Update”. Users may verify manual transactions using the MS037P
      “Transfer Percentage Inquiry” screen. This screen establishes, updates, or displays the
      prorate transfer records and their associated transfer percentages.
      7.4.3.3. The AFSC Cost Accounting and ALC/FM coordinate the documentation and use
      of this screen to adjust these percentages rather than using the automated process.
      CPBM-BTM outputs a spreadsheet format detailing the overhead cost transfer
      percentages by RCC. The CPBM-BTM interface could overwrite transfer percentages
      that have been made directly to the DIFMS Screen MS174P “Transfer Percentage
      Update” screen; therefore, the AFSC should use this option cautiously.
   7.4.4. Prior to the end of month, run the DIFMS Program MS296P “Prorate Cost Transfers
   Process”. This process uses the prorate transfer records from BTM to determine the amount
 144                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


   of cost to be percentage transferred from the G&A and Production Overhead (POH) shops to
   the benefiting direct shops. This batch process creates a JV Type ‘Cost Transfer-CT’ as
   shown on DIFMS Report 7310-706 “Percentage Cost Transfer Transactions”. When cost is
   transferred from G&A to POH, there is a posting in the USSGL accounts 61000043,
   Transfers - Production and 61000044, Transfers - General.
   7.4.5. After percentage transfers have occurred, residual costs may exist. The reason(s)
   could be attributed to: (1) transfer percentage table does not add to 100%; (2) cost is
   attempting to be transferred to a closed or invalid shop; (3) transfer indicator on the JON(s)
   charged may not be set to ‘3’; or (4) original cost may have been recorded with a
   mismatching job and job type (such as G&A JON on a production organization).
7.5. Overhead Application
   7.5.1. Costs collected by POH JONs are in direct support of the production cost center.
   Costs collected by G&A JONs are costs that indirectly benefit all production cost centers. It
   must be determined how the costs from these indirect JONs are applied to direct work to
   ensure a fair distribution of overhead expense.
   7.5.2. Using CPBM-BTM or other approved method, Overhead Application Rates (OAR)
   are established, for each direct shop by FY and quarter, based on the approved budgeted
   direct hours and total planned overhead costs. The H033-BTM system administrator
   transmits these rates to DIFMS through the MS684D01 file. The DIFMS scheduler must
   have DIFMS Program MS684P “DIFMS Shop Cost Center Rates Update” executed to
   process this file into DIFMS. Users may refer to DIFMS Report 7310-261 “Shop Cost
   Center Rates Update” for these rates. CPBM also generates a report detailing the Overhead
   Application Rates (OAR) by RCC.
       7.5.2.1. Authorized users may manually enter overhead application rates in DIFMS
       Screen MS165P “Shop/Cost Center Rates Updates”. Enter these predetermined overhead
       rates at the direct shop level for each fiscal year and quarter. Users can add, change, or
       delete a rate for a direct shop. The CPBM-BTM interface could overwrite rates that have
       been made directly to the DIFMS MS165P “Shop/Cost Center Rates Update” screen;
       therefore, the AFSC should use this option cautiously.
       7.5.2.2. DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS034P “Shop/Cost Center Rates” displays
       corresponding Overhead Rates record when shop is entered. The end of DIFMS Report
       7310-565 “Labor Distribution Summary by Expense Account” also provides the rates
       currently in use for all shops.
   7.5.3. Once DIFMS receives the rates, as direct hours are transacted, the labor distribution
   program applies overhead cost on a planned dollar rate per direct labor hour basis. The ‘LD’
   JV as shown on DIFMS Report 7310-565 “Labor Distribution Summary by Expense
   Account” includes a credit to applied overhead in USSGL accounts 660000A (POH) and
   660000B (G&A) with an offsetting debit to USSGL account 152600A1 Work In Process
   (WIP).
   7.5.4. The goal is to have minimal over or under applied overhead at the end of the fiscal
   year.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                   145


       7.5.4.1. DIFMS Report 7310-729 “Actual Versus Applied Overhead Year-To-Date”
       summarizes and lists indirect Year-to-Date cost and applied overhead at the shop level.
       If additional information is needed, use DIFMS Report 7310-731 “Indirect Cost
       Summary Year-to-Date” which provides a summary of Year-to-Date indirect hours and
       costs at the shop level both before and after transfers.
       7.5.4.2. An optional tool to analyze over and under applied overhead at RCC level is to
       create a ‘Maintain Overhead Application Rate Model’ in CPBM-BTM. The designated
       office in the AFSC creates and analyzes proposed OAR changes for possible update in
       DIFMS. Additional information can be found in the H033 User Manual.
7.6. Processing, Inquiries, and Reports for DIFMS Cost Summary
   7.6.1. The purpose of this section is to show the DIFMS users the functions of the Cost
   Summary Subsystem. DIFMS Cost Summary Processing summarizes data from internal and
   external interfaces of DIFMS such as Labor Subsystem, Material Subsystem, Feeder Systems
   (such as DFAS-IE), Business Operations (Other) Cost Subsystem, and Fixed Assets
   Subsystem.
       7.6.1.1. The purpose of the Cost Summary function is to accomplish the following:
          7.6.1.1.1. Report quarter-to-date, year-to-date and inception-to-date direct and
          indirect job order hours and costs
          7.6.1.1.2. Report business operations cost by expense account, direct Job Order
          Number, and cost category
          7.6.1.1.3. Report open and closed job status
7.6.2. The most current information can be obtained from the Technical Service Organization’s
website: https://t6800.csd.disa.mil/DifmsPortal/index.php. Please click on the appropriate tab
and then on the current production release.

                                           Chapter 8

                                           BILLING

8.1. Introduction
   8.1.1. The purpose of the Defense Industrial Financial Management System (DIFMS) billing
   function is to replenish (receive cash) the Working Capital Fund for costs accumulated while
   performing work for customers. The billing function consists of DIFMS Programs
   MS273P“Produce Billing Audit” to calculate the bills and a MS274P “Produce Customer
   Bills” actually to produce the bills.
   8.1.1.1. Not all customers will be billed for revenue purposes. Because of the Centralized
   Asset Management (CAM) Billing Suppression, the Consolidated Sustainment Activity
   Group – Maintenance (CSAG-M) has discontinued the practice of billing the Consolidated
   Sustainment Activity Group – Supply (CSAG-S) for all maintenance and manufacturing
   services at the start of FY08. CSAG-S provides Working Authority (WA) for these services;
   WA is used to ensure CSAG-S’ Contract Authority is not exceeded. No billings will occur
   and no cash will be exchanged. CSAG will not record revenue for these services.
   8.1.2. References:
       8.1.2.1. DIFMS User Manual
       8.1.2.2. DIFMS Physical Model 07, Billing
       8.1.2.3. DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 11B, Chapter 11, and Volume 4, Chapter 3
8.2. Customer Billing
   8.2.1. Customers are billed as costs are incurred up to the extended End Item Sales Price
   (EEISP) and/or upon completion of the workload. CSAG-M can fully bill revenue up to the
   extent of available funds for all order types. This allows revenue to be maximized and work-
   in-process to be minimized.
   8.2.2. Cost Accounting produces billing adjustments through the reverse billing process
   using DIFMS Screen MS123P “Reverse Bill Update”. The reverse billing system allows the
   user to reverse a bill that has already been produced in a prior billing cycle at the CON level
   or JON level, including Bill Type ‘7’ (Private Party Unfunded Surcharge Accounts Payable)
   bills. The system assigns a current-month bill number for reverse bills.
   8.2.2.1. The user cannot reverse a single bill for a JON or CON and then set the JON or
   CON to have all bills reversed. If this happens within the same billing cycle, the first
   transaction must be deleted before the second can be processed. If this happens in
   subsequent billing cycles, an error is shown on the DIFMS Report 7310-820 “DIFMS End
   Use Billing Audit”. A JON or CON may not be reversed more than once per bill number.
       8.2.2.2. If the last JON on the funding document has been final billed, that bill must be
       reversed prior to reversing other bills. A user may determine the last JON final billed on
       a funding document by using DIFMS Screen MS054P “Funding Document Inquiry”.
   8.2.3. Manual bills can be entered directly into DIFMS using the DIFMS Screen MS124P
   “Manual Billing Update”. Use this procedure judiciously for bills that cannot be processed
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     147


  mechanically. A bill number is assigned by Cost Accounting for tracking billing through the
  collection process.
  8.2.4. Prior to doing a billing, the DIFMS Program MS271P “Distribute Direct Cost” or the
  Cost Summary run needs to be on the run schedule. Cost Summary calculates direct costs,
  which are the source of billings.
     8.2.4.1. If billing fixed price JONs on a cost per unit or services basis, the user must run
     MS656P “Compute Incremental Revenue Recognition” for open JONs before the
     MS273P.
     8.2.4.2. DIFMS Program MS626P “Stabilized Cost Update” to calculate and store
     unfunded administrative surcharges for Foreign Military Sales (FMS), private party, and
     non-Department of Defense (DoD) should be in the schedule before the MS273P.
     8.2.4.3. ALC terminated JONs (status code ‘7’) do not bill the customer and are treated
     as a “total loss” to the performing activity. Status Code 7 has to be put on the JON
     manually.
  8.2.5. The Billing Audit Run is produced through the DIFMS Program MS273P “Produce
  Billing Audit”. This batch process calculates income bills at the JON level for the activity’s
  customers, computes variances, actual cost, stabilized costs, and unfunded costs to be billed
  to FMS, private party, and DOD customers. It also re-computes the funds available at the
  CON level based on the potential billings but shows no update at the JON level.
     8.2.5.1. If a bill (at the JON or CON level) needs to be overridden, the user needs to use
     DIFMS Screen MS121P “Billing Audit Override Update”.
  8.2.5.2. If the ‘audit run’ needs overridden in mass, the user needs to use DIFMS Screen
  MS164P “Billing Income/Progress Override Code”, between the audit and final billing run.
  Only designated Cost Accounting personnel will be able to use these screens.
     8.2.5.2.1. Cost Accounting has three options. First, Cost Accounting can allow all bills
     to process by using the default code of ‘N’. Second, Cost Accounting can override all
     bills by using the code of ‘A’. Third, Cost Accounting can process only manual bills
     (override system-generated bills including bill reversals) by use of code ‘M’. MS164P
     screen is used to make this selection. The default code of N is systematically set and
     does not require action.
     8.2.5.2.2. If the MS164P (Billing Income/Progress Override Update) screen is used after
     the MS273P (Produce Billing Audit) program is run, and before the MS274P (Produce
     Customer Bills) program is run, then the MS275P (Override Customer Bills Batch
     Process) program must be run with the MS274P program when it is run.
  8.2.5.3. Prior to the final billing run (DIFMS Program MS274P), Cost Accounting reviews
  the audit reports produced from DIFMS Program MS273P including DIFMS Reports 7310-
  115 “Customer Funds Status Audit Copy”, 7310-815 “Manual and Reverse Billing”, 7310-
  820 “End Use Billing Audit”, and 7310-825 “Progress / Advance Billing Audit”.
         8.2.5.3.1. DIFMS Report 7310-820 “DIFMS End Use Billing Audit” reflects
         computations of revenue, bill reversals and manual bills for current billing cycle.
         AFSC Cost Accounting uses this report to determine if all of the billing for income
         should be released to the 'Produce Bills' cycle.
 148                                                               AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


          8.2.5.3.2. The “Final Bills Available for Billing” section of the report reflects the
          JONs meeting the ALC criteria for the funding document to final bill. The JON
          override code on the MS121P “Billing Audit Override Update” must be changed from
          “Y” (yes, override the billing) to an “N” (no, do not override the billing), to create a
          bill.
          8.2.5.3.3. JONs on the “Available for Billing” section will bill, unless overridden. by
          changing the override code on MS121P screen from N (no, do not override the
          billing) to Y (yes, override the billing).
   8.2.6. Using the DIFMS Program MS274P “Produce Customer Bills”, a revenue bill is
   produced based on information passed from the production reporting systems and costs
   summarized in the cost summary sub-system. This is the final batch process for billing,
   which creates the actual bills. This process also creates the billing files, identifies variances,
   overrides for CONs and JONs, and updates the General Ledger. The program assigns the
   Current Process Date to the “Month” of the Bill-Number and to the Bill-Date. This assures a
   more accurate aging of Accounts Receivable on the DIFMS Report 7310-865 “Unliquidated
   Bills”. MS274P creates the Sales Register (OLRV 7310-870) and posts to USSGL account
   131041A “Accounts Receivable – Government Agency”, 152600A1 Work in Process,
   231042A “Advances from Others – Other- Public” and applicable revenue and cost of goods
   sold accounts.. Sales Register lists the individual accounts.
       8.2.6.1. After the final billing process has run the following steps occur: (1) Defense
       Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) receives the billing file when DIFMS Program
       MS467P “Produce Customer Billing File” has been run; (2) ALC reviews JONs
       appearing on DIFMS Report 7310-820 “End Use Billing Audit” Unavailable for Billing
       section and the Error Description section prior to the next billing cycle and notifies
       appropriate personnel to make corrections prior to the next billing.
8.3. Advanced Billing
   8.3.1. Advanced billing process is used to maintain cash solvency and is used only with
   written approval of the AFMC Director of Financial Management or Deputy. The Financial
   Management Directorate (AFMC/FM) is the AFMC office responsible for: (1) determining
   when advance billing is required; (2) coordinating with the involved organizations to include
   the AFSC/FZR and ALC/FM, customers to be billed, DFAS, and the Director of Revolving
   Funds in the DoD Comptroller organization; and (3) instructing the ALCs on the timing,
   amount, and procedures for the advance. Requirements from the DoD Comptroller
   Revolving Funds Directorate must be followed such as that issued in the Annual Operating
   Budget (AOB) prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.
   8.3.2. DIFMS allows advanced billings when the Advance From Customer Code (ADV FR
   CUST CD) is set to ‘Y’ at the Funding Document Number level. This code must be set using
   the Transaction Query & Maintenance tab in the Funding Initiation Tool System (FIT).
   8.3.3. Advance Billing occurs at the CON level by entering a Manual Bill in the MS124P
   “Manual Billing Update” screen. The amount of the Advance Bill is entered in “Prog
   Pay/Adv” as Bill Type 6 (last position in the assigned bill number). After the next Audit Bill
   Run (MS273P), “Advan Fr Cust Pend” as shown on MS053P Option 2 will increase and
   “Fndd Aval to Bld” on MS053P Option 3 will decrease by the amount of the advance bill.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                    149


   Total Billed will remain unchanged until future billings when the ALC is entitled to
   recognize the revenue on the JONs under the CON. DIFMS report 7310-815 “DIFMS
   Manual and Reverse Billing” and 7310-825 “DIFMS Progress/Advance Billing Audit” list
   details of the individual bills.
      8.3.3.1. The Customer Bill Run (MS274P) will complete the billing cycle and produce
      OLRV 7310-830 “DIFMS Customer Billing”. The total amount of the Advance Bills
      does not appear in the general ledger until the advance bills are liquidated.
      8.3.3.2. As the advance bills are liquidated, amounts are posted as debit to USSGL
      101041A, Fund Bal with Treasury, and credit 231041B Advances from Others – Cash
      Advances – Inside DoD.
   8.3.3.3. MS695P must be included in subsequent schedules every time before the Audit Bill
   Run (MS273P). MS695P adjusts Work in Process (WIP).The cash collection of the Advance
   Bills will move the amounts from “Advan Fr Cust Pend” to “Advan Fr Cust Bal” as shown
   on MS053P Option 2 “Customer Order Inquiry Screen
      8.3.3.4. After the advance billing, as costs are incurred on the JON, DIFMS will process
      bills during normal billing runs. The amount of these bills will be deducted from Advan
      Fr Cust Bal and added to Total Billed as shown on the MS053P screens Option 2 and 3.
      General Ledger postings are debit to 231041B and credit to Revenue accounts (520000x).
   8.3.4. During testing of Advance Billing, it was discovered that a JON tied to an Advance
   Billed CON will not bill when it is closed or completions changed after the advance billing.
   It will bill only when there is a change in cost. This can leave a balance in “Advan Fr Cust
   Bal” and total revenue will not be recognized.
      8.3.4.1. A cumbersome workaround would be to monitor completions and closures on
      each JON under an advance billed CON. As completions increase or JONs close,
      manually enter a credit “advance” bill for the unbilled amount due. During the next
      billing cycle, the credit bill will decrease the Advan Fr Cust Bal and increase Fndd Avail
      to Bld. The risk of this workaround is when the original advance billing occurred the
      customer’s obligation was decreased in BQ. Posting of the manual credit bill in BQ will
      return the obligation to the customer. If this workaround is used, a billing should be
      scheduled immediately following the completion of the credit bill run to ensure that the
      funds remain available in obligation status in BQ. During this run, the JON should bill
      the amount due based on the closure or completions, decrease the Fndd Avail to Bld,
      increase Total Billed, and recognize revenue.
   8.3.5. Further testing and possible rewrite of the required software before Advance Billing
   would be advisable.
8.4. Billing for FMS, Private Party, and Other Non-DoD Customers
   8.4.1. TYPE CUSTOMER CODES:
   8.4.1.1. FMS - 1
   8.4.1.2. PRIVATE PARTY - 2
   8.4.1.3. NONDOD - 3
   8.4.1.4. DOD - 4
 150                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


   8.4.2. Private Party (Type Customer Code 2): DIFMS Programs MS273P “Produce
   Billing Audit” and MS274P “Produce Customer Bills” allow for fixed price order type codes
   to be used for private party billings. This includes Order Type ‘1’ (Fixed Price Units), Order
   Type ‘7’ (Fixed Price Non-Navy Components) and Order Type ‘9’ (Fixed Price Non-
   Components). In addition, stabilized rate billing for Order Type Code ‘4’ (Cost
   Reimbursement Services) and Order Type ‘3’ (Cost Reimbursable Units) is also allowed for
   private party customers.
       8.4.2.1. This capability meets the requirement in the Depot Maintenance community to
       do fixed price partnering work with private companies. The capability provides the
       flexibility to “charge” or “not charge” unfunded surcharges. The private party documents
       under these Order Type Codes can be assessed surcharges unless designated otherwise
       through use of an exclusion indicator on the individual funding document.
   8.4.3. The FMS billing process (Type Customer Code ‘1’) allows for billing at a fixed
   price in a manner similar to what is done for private parties.
       8.4.3.1. DIFMS Screen MS162P “Unfunded Billing Rates Updates” permits the user to
       establish applicable rates to allow DIFMS to bill unfunded costs mechanically for FMS,
       private parties, and other non-DoD customers, which includes administrative surcharges
       for the rates and applicable appropriation codes as instructed by AFMC/FM. DIFMS
       Screen MS754P “Edit Surcharge Exclusions Updates” allows specific administrative
       surcharges to be excluded from bills to certain FMS, private party, or non-DoD
       customers, when appropriate. The capital reserve and any other surcharges dictated by
       HQ-AFMC are entered via DIFMS Screen MS161P “Bill Level Billing Rate Update”.
       8.4.3.2. The Unfunded Civilian Fringe Benefit factor as provided by AFMC/FM is
       applied to the regular pay portion of the labor on the JON. The most current rate can be
       found at: http://comptroller.defense.gov/rates. FMS bills must be authorized by the
       Security Assistance Accounting Center through the Security Assistance Management
       Information System (SAMIS).
       8.4.3.3. FMS is treated as Government Accounts Receivable (A/R). DIFMS Program
       MS274P “Produce Customer Bills” post FMS billings to USSGL account 131041A
       (Government Receivables). Budgetary postings for Unfilled Customer Orders (422141)
       and Budgetary Receivables (425141 and 425241) are posted systematically.
8.5. Work In Process (WIP). DIFMS applies direct expenses and applied overhead (POH and
G&A) to WIP. DIFMS also uses a Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) account to record the amount of
WIP sold to the customers based on billing.
   8.5.1. DIFMS Program MS271P “Distribute Direct Costs” process updates JON cost data
   records, computes work-in-process balances at the Job Order Number (JON) level, rolls the
   costs up to the Customer Order Number (CON) level, and rolls all current cycle costs for
   direct and indirect shops, Contractual/Other, and Object Class into Month-to-date (MTD),
   Quarter-To-Date (QTD), Year-To-Date (YTD), and Inception-To-Date (ITD - Direct Only).
   This information is fed to downstream systems such as DDS and CPBM-H033. Reports are
   also fed to OLRV and available for query. DIFMS Report 7310-125 “Unbillable Work In
   Process Report” lists customer orders with costs that have exceeded the funded amount.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                    151


   8.5.2. USSGL account 1526, Inventory-Work in Process, is the control account for all
   unbilled job orders. The amount of Work in Process consists of all costs applied to unbilled
   job orders including direct labor, direct materials, applied indirect overhead, and G&A
   expenses. AFSC FZR reviews and resolves the WIP balance on unbilled job orders in
   coordination with the ALC/FM as each billing cycle is produced.
   8.5.3. The costs incurred on a customer order may be more or less than the revenue earned,
   depending upon whether costs incurred exceed the funded amount on the customer order or
   whether costs incurred are less than the funded amount on the customer order. Therefore, a
   gain or loss (variance) may occur on the work performed on a customer order. Variances are
   recognized as the JONs under the CON are billed.
   8.5.4. The ALC/FM and AFSC FZR jointly establish procedures for the routine review of
   WIP account balances so that appropriate actions may be taken, if necessary, to reduce
   significant balances in the WIP account. The review must focus on completed customer
   orders where costs incurred exceed the funding provided on the existing customer order.
   Ultimately, these costs should be transferred from the WIP account to operating
   expenses/program costs or to COGS. The review should evaluate the compliance with the
   percentage of completion method for revenue recognition and accounts receivable policy
   (DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 11B, Chapters 11 and 4 respectively).
   8.5.5. Quarterly, the ALC/FM and AFSC FZR review the uncollected Accounts Receivable
   (A/R) on the DIFMS Report 7310-865 “DIFMS Unliquidated Bills”. With approval of
   ALC/FM, AFMC/FM, and DFAS, write-off account receivable accounts that are no longer
   expected to be collected.
8.6. Revenue Recognition
   8.6.1. Revenue is identified and billed on the JON level. DIFMS calculates revenue based
   on funding, costs incurred, completed units, and sales prices established by the user. Using
   historical workload and expenses data, along with AFMC direction, the ALC uses
   Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group-Maintenance (CSAG-M) systems to develop sales
   rates. Using the Sales Price Generator (SPG) System, budget analysts use sales rates, direct
   material and direct labor cost history, along with standard hours to calculate End Item Sales
   Prices (EISP) for non-serialized workloads.
   8.6.2. Revenue recognition and billings are based on cost incurred and units completed for
   all fixed price JONs. DIFMS recognizes revenue based on the following formula:
      8.6.2.1. Fixed Price JON(s) Revenue Formula
          8.6.2.1.1. Revenue = (Units Complete x EISP), or
          8.6.2.1.2. When no units are completed, Revenue = Cost Incurred to Date (Material,
          Labor and Overhead not to exceed the EISP x Units Inducted)
          8.6.2.1.3. Cost Reimbursable JONs Revenue is recognized based on the actual cost
          recorded on the JONs
 152                                                                AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014

8.7. Billing Reports
   8.7.1. DIFMS Program MS273P “Billing Audit” is run prior to the DIFMS Final Run
   (MS274P). Billing is usually run twice a month, but can be run as often as required. This
   batch process calculates the ALC income bills at the JON level based on type customer code,
   order type code, status code, stabilized rates, and CON funds authorized. There are four
   reports associated with DIFMS Program MS273P.
        8.7.1.1. DIFMS Report 7310-115 “Customer Funds Status Report – Audit Copy”
        provides a billing status and summarizes information on cost, billing, and variances at the
        Funding Document level at the time the Audit Run is produced
        8.7.1.2. DIFMS Report 7310-815 “Manual and Reverse Billing” provides data regarding
        manual or reverse bills entered into the system by the user.
        8.7.1.3. DIFMS Report 7310-820 “End Use Billing Audit” provides income bill
        calculations at the JON level summarized to the CON. Calculations are based on the
        Order Type Code, Type Customer Code, Status Code of the JON, and the stabilized or
        fixed price rates. Bills will be “calculated” regardless of funds available.
        8.7.1.3.1. “Available for Billing” is the first section and lists JONs that will bill when the
        MS274P is run unless the user makes the decision to override the bill by using MS12lP
        screen by changing the Override Code from N to Y.
        8.7.1.3.2. The second section is “Final Bills Available for Billing” that lists the JONs
        that are the last JONs on a Funding Document. If these JONs bill, the Funding Document
        will be final billed. If the user elects for these JONs to bill, the MS121P screen can be
        used changing the Override Code from Y to N.
        8.7.1.3.3. The third section is “Unavailable for Billing Due to Insufficient Funds or
        Minimum Bill Amt” and lists the JONs that cannot bill due to funding shortage. This
        section will not bill and should be reviewed by Cost Accounting and the Maintenance
        Wing to resolve the funding shortage before the next billing.
        8.7.1.3.4. The last section is “Error Description” and lists CONs that are out of balance
        with the JONs attached to them and JONs that cannot bill for a variety of reasons. The
        section should be reviewed by Cost Accounting and the Maintenance Wing to resolve the
        issues before the next billing if possible.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                        153


       8.7.1.4. DIFMS Report 7310-825 “Progress Pay/Advance Billing Audit”.
           8.7.1.4.1. Part I reflects the status of Payments for the Billing Cycle. Payments are
           calculated at the CON level.
           8.7.1.4.2. Part II reflects manual advance bills for DoD customers created via the
           DIFMS Screen MS124P “Manual Billing Update”. Advance bills are created at the
           CON level.
8.7.2. DIFMS Report 7310-105 “Customer Order Status” provides inception-to-date (ITD)
status of accounting data, cost incurred, billings, and variances for each customer.The report is
produced through DIFMS Program MS379P.
       8.7.2.1. Part I ‘By Sponsor’ provides funding document data.
       8.7.2.2. Part II ‘By CON’ provides information by Customer Order Number.
       8.7.2.3. Part III summarizes the CON information by program and report totals. This
       report is also used as the subsidiary for the following accounts.

   8.7.3. Reconciliation and corrective action needs to occur at the ALC to keep the Subsidiary
   Ledger and the General Ledger in agreement. DIFMS Report 7310-105, Part III, provides
   separate subtotal identity of ‘Reimbursable Funds Authorized’, ‘Reimbursable Funds
   Available’, ‘Surcharges Billed YTD’, and ‘Progress Pay/Advances Pending’.
       8.7.3.1. The criteria for ‘Reimbursable’ is based on a Manufacturing-Type-Code of ‘0’,
       ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘6’ or ‘9’. This excludes all Unfunded Manufacturing Type Codes such as ‘1’
       (In-House Manufacturing), ‘4’ (CIP), ‘5’ (In-House MRPMA), ‘7’ (Multi-Funded
       Collection) and ‘8’ (Direct Cite). This provides traceability and comparability to the
       DIFMS Report 7310-130 “Summary Source of Revenue” that includes only amounts
       from reimbursable funding documents.
154                                                          AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      8.7.3.2. The subtotal for ‘Surcharges Billed’ helps to reconcile comparisons to ‘Orders
      Received’ on the DIFMS Report 7310-130 since the ‘Orders Received’ column includes
      funding for surcharge for the current fiscal year.           Similarly, the ability to
      compare/reconcile ‘Funds Available’ to the overall USSGL 4220 series account balances
      is aided by inclusion of the ‘Progress Pay/Advances Pending’, since these numbers have
      to be added back into the Funds Available to get a true ‘Unfilled Customer Order’
      (USSGL account 4220 series) balance.
  8.7.4. DIFMS Report 7310-130 can be used for financial statement reporting purposes, when
  the report is produced at the same time as the 7310-105 report. Running both reports at the
  same time is imperative at End of Year closeout.
  8.7.5. DIFMS Report 7310-830 “Customer Billing” provides a summary of all bills that
  were produced for the cycle as well as all bill calculations that were overridden. All
  JONs/CON(s) from the DIFMS Reports 7310-820 (DIFMS End Use Billing Audit) and
  7310-825 (DIFMS Progress/Advance Billing Audit)” should appear in one of the sections on
  this report.
  8.7.6. DIFMS Report 7310-835 “Unfunded Amounts Billed” provides detail information on
  unfunded surcharges that were billed during the current cycle.
  8.7.7. DIFMS Report 7310-870 “Sales Register” provides the details for the postings to the
  General Ledger for the Billing Cycle.
  8.7.8. DIFMS Report 7310-875 “Schedule of Variances” provides a breakout of the
  variances taken for the cycle by JON summarized to the CON.
  8.7.9. DIFMS Report 7310-880 “Variance Ledger Summary” provides Month-to-Date
  (MTD), Quarter-to-Date (QTD), and Year-to-Date (YTD) variances by CON and is the
  Subsidiary to the General Ledger for the Billing Variances.
  8.7.10. DIFMS Report 7310-885 “Status of Funds” may be used to send to the customers
  when a Status of Funds for the order is required.
  8.7.11. DIFMS Report 7310-890 “Voucher for Disbursements and/or Collection” shows the
  ALC’s side of the bill with reference to “2035” for the customer’s Line of Accounting.
  8.7.12. DIFMS Report 7310-850 “Summary of Accounting Data Navcompt 2035” shows the
  customer’s Line of Accounting and supports 7310-890.

9.1. Introduction
   9.1.1. The Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group (CSAG) Maintenance Division uses the
   Defense Industrial Financial Management System (DIFMS) system to record both systemic
   and manual cost accounting transactions. DIFMS uses journals to post these data to the
   general ledger from which CSAG reports are created. DIFMS maintains the chart of
   accounts as outlined in the United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL).

   9.2.2. The following DIFMS reports will be referred to throughout this chapter.
       9.2.2.1. DIFMS Direct Costs by Cost Center, Year-to-Date (7310-721) provides a
       summary of year-to-date direct hours and costs at the Cost Center Level by types of
       Manufacturing.
       9.2.2.2. DIFMS General Ledger Details Year To Date (7310-915) is, essentially, the
       year-to-date general ledger. It contains the detailed systemic and manual transactional
       history by general ledger account. Use as a research tool to trace back historical postings
       to each account throughout the current fiscal year.
       9.2.2.3. General Ledger Summary (7310-920) provides summary balances by USSGL
       account number for the current month, quarter, previous months or quarters, prior year,
       and Inception to Date. Accounting uses this report as a quick reference for USSGL
       account balances for the various periods.
       9.2.2.4. General Ledger Worksheet (7310-925) provides an accountant's worksheet to
       be used at the end of the reporting period to determine what adjusting and closing entries
       are necessary to accurately disclose financial information. Accounting reviews the trial
       balance column to obtain pre-closeout figures for end-of-year reporting.
       9.2.2.5. Financial Statement Feeder (7310-930) lists USSGL account balances for
       preparing the Financial and Cost statements. Accounting uses this report to prepare the
       exhibits in the Financial and Cost Statements.
       9.2.2.6. DIFMS General Ledger Trial Balance (7310-935) is a cumulative (produced
       daily) trial balance report that is formatted classified by proprietary, budgetary, and
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     157


     statistical accounts. The report also flags whether or not the total database is in balance
     (total debts equal total credits). (See paragraph 9.8.1.2. for further information)
     9.2.2.7. DIFMS Processed Journal Vouchers, Year-to-Date (7310-940) reflects copies
     of all JVs, both systemic and manual, for the full year.
     9.2.2.8. DIFMS Processed Journal Vouchers (7310-945) is the same as the 7310-940
     except it is produced daily. Only the previous day’s JVs will be published. This report is
     part of the audit trail and is used to validate correct transaction posting by showing the
     source and summarized amounts of each systemic and manual journal voucher. For each
     manual JV posted, print the matching JV and attach to the JV package.
     9.2.2.9. DIFMS General Ledger Account Non-Navy Transmission Listing (7310-
     951) provides trial balance information. It is formatted in three column groups: GLAC,
     debit or credit code, and amounts with no summary or overall totals.
     9.2.2.10. DIFMS Prior Period Trial Balance (7310-954) was designed to allow
     backdated trial balance creation within the current fiscal year. It is to be used primarily
     to create a trial balance that has a backdated adjustment that was posted after the normal
     last month end was run. (This report should only be produced in coordination with the
     local AFSC Cost Accounting and DFAS.) It can also be used as a failsafe report and can
     be requested as needed. If the 7310-951 or 7310-935 reports were not published, this
     report can be run (run stream MS432R01) and back dated to the necessary date. This
     report is formatted the same as the 7310-935 report.
     9.2.2.11. Automated Balancing (7310-965) provides a comparison of general ledger
     and subsidiary accounts. This report is used to compare and investigate discrepancies
     between subsidiary accounts and the general ledger.
     9.2.2.12. Statement of Financial Condition (7310-970) produces the automated
     financial statement. Accounting may use this report for balancing reports. This report is
     the same as the DIFMS Report 7310-971 except that it compares data for the end of the
     current quarter and the end of the previous quarter. New GLACs will need to be
     coordinated with Defense Finance and Accounting Service Information and Technology
     (DFAS I&T) to be added to this report.
     9.2.2.13. Comparative Financial Statement (Statement of Financial Condition)
     (7310-971) is the balance sheet. It provides a comparison of the current month, year to
     date, and the prior month year-to-date ending balance giving an increase or decrease
     between the two periods. It is used to report and reconcile assets with liabilities plus
     equity. Line item details for each category of Assets and Liabilities, as well as totals are
     displayed as described above for the end of the current period, the end of the previous
     month, and the amount of increase or decrease. Details for equity are shown on the
     DIFMS Report 7310-976. These reports should be reviewed at End of Month (EOM)
     prior to trial balance submission. The variance between assets and liabilities plus equity
     should be Net Operating Results (NOR) plus transfers in/out of fixed assets. Note: in the
     following discussion, the Funds Balances with Treasury accounts, GLACs 101040XX, are
     often referred to as cash accounts.
158                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      9.2.2.14. Analysis of Capital of Funds (7310-975) produces an automated financial
      statement. This report is the same as the DIFMS Report 7310-976 except that it
      compares prior FY amounts with current FY amounts.
      9.2.2.15. Comparative Financial Statement - Analysis of Capital Funds (7310-976)
      provides a monthly comparison of current month to prior month and gives the increase or
      decrease between the two periods. The report displays and compares supporting details
      for the equity amount reported on DIFMS Report 7310-975. Details are displayed for the
      end of the current month, end of the previous month, and the amount of
      increase/decrease. Under normal conditions, there should be no amount of increase or
      decrease during a given year as equity postings are only allowed during fiscal year
      closeout. Review this report in conjunction with 7310-971 at EOM prior to trial balance
      submission.
      9.2.2.16. DIFMS Income Statement (7310-977) produces financial data for automated
      generation of an Income Statement similar to the Air Force 7118 Report (Statement of
      Revenue and Expense Report). However, since the report may not contain all month end
      adjustments, the report should be used with caution. New GLACs will need to be
      coordinated with DFAS I&T to be added to this report.
      9.2.2.17. Civilian Pay Accounting Interface System (CPAIS E4R6L) Employee
      Directory Listing report is a Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS) report. This report
      is also referred to as the R60 and is the data source for the civilian pay disbursement
      journal entries.
  9.2.3. Programs
      9.2.3.1. Build Closing Journal Entries (Monthly) (MS221P) is the program to
      monthly close-out direct cost accounts to work-in-process-in-house at the end of the
      month through a “XC” closing journal voucher.
      9.2.3.2. Process Reverse Manual Journal Vouchers (MS222P) is the program that
      reverses the auto-reversing manual journal vouchers posted in the previous month. The
      actual reversals are recorded in the first report run of General Ledger Account (e.g.,
      DIFMS 7310-945 ‘DIFMS Processed Journal Vouchers’ report) for the following month
      and identified in the general ledger by 'VR' followed by four numbers to assign the month
      and sequence number.
      9.2.3.3. Distribute Direct Costs (MS271J) is the process that rolls all current cycle
      costs into Month-to-Date, Quarter-to-Date, and Year-to-Date for both Direct and Indirect-
      Shop-Cost and Contractual-Other-Cost records and Inception-to-Date fields for 'Direct
      Only'.
      9.2.3.4. General Ledger Summary and Financial Statement Feeder (MS352J) run
      stream occurs every evening. However, it can be run whenever a new trial balance is
      needed, (e.g., DIFMS General Ledger Account Non Navy Transmission Listing (7310-
      951) and DIFMS General Ledger Trial Balance (7310-935)).
  9.2.4. Accounting Book Structure
      9.2.4.1. The General Journal is a book (or database table) where accounting
      transactions are first recorded. Transactions are recorded in chronological order. In
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     159


     essence, DIFMS has one journal where all data is recorded. See Online Report View
     (OLRV) reports DIFMS Processed Journal Voucher Report (7310-945) for a specific day
     or DIFMS Processed Journal Vouchers, Year-to-Date (7310-940).
     9.2.4.2. General Ledger. All systemic and manual transactions are chronologically
     posted in the general journal. The data passes to the general ledger. The general ledger
     accumulates and summarizes all transactions by general ledger account. This ledger is the
     source for all periodic trial balances and other reports. Account segregation and
     summarization also allows CSAG managers to review specific account detail.
     9.2.4.3. General Ledger Control Accounts contains summary level information. The
     balance in a control account is the total of many individual transactions. It is linked to a
     subsidiary account that contains the detail of a given type of transaction. The total of the
     control account should equal the total of all the records in its related subsidiary account.
     For example, control accounts 131041A and 131042A report the control totals of
     outstanding accounts receivable bills found in the DIFMS Unliquidated Bills (7310-865)
     subsidiary report. Not all general ledger accounts are control accounts because subsidiary
     detail is not required.
     9.2.4.4. Subsidiary Ledger is a collection of second-level detail accounts used to
     maintain detailed data and tied to a control general ledger control account. These detail
     accounts are called subsidiary accounts.
     9.2.4.5. Subsidiary Account is a secondary level account that contains detail data that
     supports control account balances. For example, the accounts receivable subsidiary
     account would be the outstanding unpaid bills. The total of the bills in the subsidiary
     accounts must equal the total of the control account. Likewise, any adjustments in either
     ledger must have matching adjustments in the other.

       9.2.4.6. United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) contains the chart of
       accounts that is the foundation of the DIFMS accounting process. Depot Maintenance
       Accounting and Production System (DMAPS) uses the USSGL account code structure
       which is a uniform Chart of Accounts. It was created to standardize general ledger
       account codes (GLAC) in order to eliminate reporting disconnects between all Federal
       Government entities. Technical guidance and the chart of accounts can be reviewed on
       the Department of Treasury web site listed in paragraph 9.1.1 above.
   9.2.5. Chart of Accounts
       9.2.5.1. USSGL Chart of Accounts lists all available account names and numbers
       arranged in the order in which they appear in the trial balance. The full construct of the
       USSGL is eight positions. DIFMS may use up to all eight USSGL positions for its
       various accounts. The first four digits are controlled by the Treasury Department while
       the final four are designated by the using/reporting entity. The chart of accounts used
       should be identical from base to base. Differences due to unique base missions should be
       minimized. New GLACs will need to be coordinated with DFAS I&T to be added to this
       report.

       9.2.5.4. New GLACs need to be added occasionally. The new GLAC should be the
       same for each base, and when a new GLAC is added, all three bases must add it to their
       respective systems. If the GLAC is to be tied to a subsidiary ledger, DFAS I&T must add
       it because the subsidiary ledger will need to be created and linked to the new GLAC. If
       the GLAC will not be linked to a subsidiary ledger, the base cost accounting office will
       use the General Ledger Account Update (MS173P) and the General Ledger Budget
       Tracking Update (MS753P) screens to create the account. (Note: DFAS associates
       cannot add new accounts.) The MS753P screen shows fields for each month of the fiscal
       year.    These new accounts must be coordinated with DFAS-CO Accounting
       Requirements and Departmental Reporting so they can be added to the Working Capital

Note: All JVs are posted systemically except for VM and VP that are posted manually. All
journal entries can be found in the 7310-915, 7310-940, and the 7310-945 reports.
   9.3.2. Systemic vs. Manual Entries
       9.3.2.1. Systemic entries are coded into the DIFMS program and post automatically with
       little or no human intervention. The action may be triggered by a mechanic “wanding in”
       on a project or a computer scheduler kicking off the run schedule. Additionally,
       transactions from other DIFMS feeder or sub-systems create automated JVs.
       9.3.2.2. Manual entries are created and then posted to the general ledger through the
       Manual Journal Voucher Update screen (MS172P). Manual JVs are created by DFAS
       associates or AFSC Air Force Cost Accounting office. All manual journal voucher
       posting is to be done by DFAS associates only.
       9.3.2.3. Manual JVs are done for two reasons: source entry and correcting adjustment
       errors. These entries can be permanent or auto-reverse.
166                                                               AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


         9.3.2.3.1. Manual source-entry JVs are for adjustments that, due to system
         limitations, have not been recorded. Timing differences, no automated interface, or
         account reconciliation may require manual entries. Source-entry JVs may also
         include data call transactions, such as those required to record the civilian pay
         disbursement JV. Source-entry accounting transactions are generally used for month-
         end processing and year-end closing purposes.
         9.3.2.3.2. Correcting entries adjust for errors identified during the review process. In
         some cases, correcting entries are required to adjust for errors on previously prepared
         JVs. In this instance, correcting entries should both reverse the effect of incorrect
         entries and record the correct amount. In some cases, both entries can be made with
         one journal voucher and a single set of supporting documentation. Use good
         judgment when correcting a previous posting and make the correction as low a risk as
         possible. The number of JVs and their complexity increases the risk of more errors.
         Regardless of whether a single JV is prepared, or multiple journal vouchers are
         prepared, the correcting JVs should include a copy of the original JV first page
         (include original supporting documents only needed to clarify the correction), with
         COPY stamped on it, and narrative explaining how it is known that the original entry
         is incorrect.
         9.3.2.3.3. Manual postings can be permanent or auto-reverse. A permanent JV is
         posted when the result of the transaction is to remain in the records. If the adjustment
         change is to be temporary, it should be reversed. Use the “OVRD CD” (upper right
         corner) field on the MS172P screen to request whether or not to reverse. If the JV is
         to be permanent, enter Y; if it is to be reversed, leave the field blank. If left blank, the
         transaction will reverse systemically after the final month-end trial balance (run
         stream MS352J) is run. The system will publish the reversing entry in the OLRV
         DIFMS Processed Journal Vouchers – Current (7310-945) and the DIFMS Processed
         Journal Vouchers – Year-To-Date (7310-940) reports.
         9.3.2.3.4. An individual manual budgetary JV may be required to correct
         discrepancies in the budgetary accounts typically updated by purely budgetary events
         such as Commitments, Obligations, and Unfilled Customer Orders.
  9.3.3. In some cases, adjustments for certain proprietary accounts as in Table 9.5 need a
  matching budget adjustment. DIFMS is programmed to add many budget adjustments
  automatically. This process helps reduce the manual effort required for corresponding
  budgetary manual journal voucher entries. The automatic production of budgetary entries is
  limited to ‘current period’ JVs. The seldom-used Prior Period JVs (Action Code ‘P’)
  proprietary JV still requires a separate manual budgetary journal voucher. The user is able to
  immediately call up and view the results of a successful journal voucher (including the
  automated budgetary entries) by either using the DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS044P “Journal
  Voucher” or the DIFMS Update Screen MS172P with Action Code ‘I’ (Inquiry).
  Additionally, the 7310-945 report copy of the JV will include the budget adjustment.
      9.3.3.1. The “behind the scenes” budgetary postings are built on posting logic coded into
      DIFMS that relate budgetary to proprietary accounts. The system then attaches the
      budget adjustment to the journal entry. The adjustment is based on the first six digits of
      the budget GLAC. Below is Table 9.5, which shows relationships; however, understand
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                    167


      that this table is not all-inclusive and, because changes may be made in the future, it is
      dynamic.

      9.3.3.2. To accurately produce the appropriate automated budgetary entries, the posting
      screen requires that equal offsetting entries occur on each line of the journal voucher
      whenever a proprietary line is entered. For certain proprietary GLACs, there must be
      matching and equal credit to the offsetting GLAC. For example, post the disbursement of
      $20,000.00 to two liability accounts like this:

          9.3.3.2.2. The system will respond with the error message; “Each line must be
          balanced Debit/Credit to produce budgetary JV”.
   9.3.4. Journal Voucher Package
       9.3.4.1. A properly compiled JV package must have all necessary supporting
       documentation for a reasonably informed person to understand the transaction and
       determine validity. As stated in the DoD FMR 7000.14-R, VOL 6A CH 2 paragraph
       020208.D.1 thru 10, the general rules for a proper JV package include:
       9.3.4.2. The JV should be formatted and typed in an easy to read and understandable
       way.
       9.3.4.3. The heading should contain the words in large font JOURNAL VOUCHER with
       the base and fund code below it. On the right hand side should be two lines, one for the
       JV number and the other for the “As of Date”. The systemic produced JV number is to
       be written on the JV number line. The “As of Date” entered should be the effective date
       of the JV, not the date it was created. For example, the civilian pay disbursement JV is to
       be dated the disbursement day. If the payday is 14 May, but the JV is created on 18 May,
       the date of the JV should be 14 May. For month-end processing, the date of the JV
       should be the last day of the month being closed even though the JV is actually being
       created in the following month.
       9.3.4.4. The General Ledger Accounts need to match the transaction being recorded and
       the GLAC description must match the GLAC number. Even though the GLAC is correct
       and the amount was posted correctly according to the GLAC, if the incorrect description
       is used the transaction may be questioned.
       9.3.4.5. The total of the debits and credits must equal.
       9.3.4.6. The data source is the listings, data queries, reports, worksheets, Excel file
       names, emails, etc. These should be acknowledged including the date time group. A
       person, office, or similar reference is not a source. If a previous JV is part of the
       supporting documents, the JV number must be included. A copy of the first page of the
       JV must be included with “COPY” stamped or written on it. Unless necessary for
       understanding, do not include this JV’s supporting documents. If the supporting report
       has any Privacy Act information such as names and Social Security Numbers, this
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                   169


     information must be obscured in some manner. In no way should this information be
     discernable. All supporting information should be clear enough to allow duplication of
     the data and verify the conclusions.
     9.3.4.7. Include the DIFMS Action Code. See Figure 9.2, Manual Journal Voucher
     Update Screen (MS172P) Fields Defined.
     9.3.4.8. Indicate with large font, a statement noting whether the JV must be
     automatically reversed.
     9.3.4.9. The correct JV Category Code (Cat Code) and title that corresponds to the
     transaction being recorded must be entered in the JV CAT CODE field. Currently, this
     code is not posted into DIFMS, but is still required. Following are the Category Codes
     and definitions as defined by DOD FMR VOL 6A CH 2 paragraph 020208.D.1 thru 10.
        9.3.4.9.1. Category A (Reversing Entries for Prior Reporting Period) – Journal
        vouchers shall include documentation regarding the original accrual entry and an
        explicit statement that the journal voucher is a reversing entry.
        9.3.4.9.2. Category B (Data Call Entry) – Source entry information may be
        provided by data calls where the data are not recorded on a detailed transaction basis.
        Journal vouchers shall be prepared to record the summarized data call amounts in
        these situations so the amounts can be recorded in the general ledger trial balance.
        The ‘data call’ entry shall be supported by documentation for the summarized
        amount, and the entry shall identify the source or location of the transaction-level
        supporting detail and/or information for the entry. Examples of data call entries
        include property, plant, and equipment; operating materials and supplies;
        environmental liabilities; contingent liabilities; and employee benefit data.
        9.3.4.9.3. Category C (Balancing Entries for Eliminations) – When the duly
        authorized official has determined that entries are necessary to balance buyer side
        data with the seller side data, a correcting journal voucher shall be prepared prior to
        eliminating selected intra-governmental accounts. The documentation shall include
        the appropriate worksheets that show in detail the seller side data that were received,
        the buyer side control values that are being adjusted, and the calculation of the
        adjustment amount. The supporting documentation for these journal vouchers shall
        also include a narrative that summarizes the procedures that were used to make buyer
        side adjustments and include the following information:
        9.3.4.9.3.1. Eliminations are necessary so as not to overstate or understate the
        performance or financial position of a reporting entity by including the effects of
        transactions within a reporting entity. As stated in the notes to the financial
        statements and DoD FMR Volume 6B, Chapter 13 , DoD uses intra-DoD summary
        seller side balances for revenue, accounts receivable, and unearned revenue to adjust
        the intra-DoD departmental buyer side records for costs, accounts payable, and
        advances, respectively. Balancing entries for eliminating entries include amounts to
        ensure that the corresponding transfer in and transfer out accounts are equal for
        trading partners. A failure to balance the buyer and seller side data could result in
        significant distortions in consolidated financial statements.
            9.3.4.9.3.2. The procedures to use information provided by the seller for fiscal
170                                                         AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


         year reporting were developed due to systems limitations that prevent the
         identification of buyer side transactions by specific trading partners.
         9.3.4.9.3.3. All supporting documentation is attached, including the detailed
         information from the seller that was used to adjust the buyer side records and the
         resulting accounting entries.
      9.3.4.9.4. Category D (Recognition of Undistributed Disbursements and
      Collections) – Entries shall be made to adjust Fund Balance with Treasury, as
      reported, for the amount of supported undistributed disbursements and collections
      reported in the departmental expenditure system.            The proper supporting
      documentation for this type of journal voucher consists of identifiable amounts that
      are in transit from other sources (such as DFAS or Federal agencies). Many amounts
      at the detailed transaction level are not available due to timing differences, and
      support consists solely of transmitted sums. In such a case, evidence available to
      support the journal voucher adjustments consists of summarized transmittal amounts.
      However, for audit trail purposes, the detailed transaction level amounts shall be
      obtained from the transmittal source when the amounts become available. Further
      evidence includes documentation of procedures and the allocation process used to
      apply undistributed disbursements and collections to accounts payable and accounts
      receivable, respectively.
      9.3.4.9.5. Category E (Reconciliation of Trial Balance and Budget Execution
      Reports) – Journal voucher entries in this category are made to match trial balances
      or other source data reported by field accounting sites and/or accounting stations to
      the DoD Component’s budget execution reports. Trial balances or other source data
      should be considered correct and should only be adjusted to budget execution data in
      instances where budget execution data are determined to be more accurate. The
      journal voucher shall document why a discrepancy exists in the data, the reason the
      budget execution data or other data are considered to be more accurate, the evidence
      to support this reason, and how it was determined that the entries on the journal
      voucher are correct.
      9.3.4.9.6. Category F (Supply Management Inventory) – A correcting journal
      voucher shall be prepared when the duly authorized official has determined that
      inventory values for supply management activities need to be adjusted from standard
      price to approximate historical cost. The supporting documentation shall include
      appropriate references to DoD FMR Volume 4, Chapter 4 and a clear explanation of
      the method that was used to comply with the policy to value inventory and cost of
      goods sold.
      9.3.4.9.7. Category G (Reclassification of Accounts) – A correcting journal
      voucher shall be prepared to crosswalk data from installation level accounts to the
      USSGL when the duly authorized official has determined that the accounting systems
      are unable to provide data at the required level of detail for financial statement and
      footnote presentation. The supporting documentation shall include a narrative that
      explains the reason the reclassification is necessary and the reason the systems are
      unable to provide the data at the required level of detail.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     171


        9.3.4.9.8. Category H (Identified Errors and Reasonableness Checks) – Evidence
        to support either an authorized official or auditor identified correcting journal voucher
        shall include a detailed listing of identified errors, a narrative explaining how it is
        known that the original entry is incorrect, a related analysis documenting the
        calculation of the correct amount, and the sources of the data that were used in the
        analysis.
        9.3.4.9.9. Category I (Adjustment to Balance Reports Internally) – A correcting
        journal voucher may be necessary when the duly authorized official has determined
        that a reconciliation of data supporting two different reports cannot be performed.
        Evidence to support this type of journal voucher shall include documentation of the
        reconciliation efforts made before determining that the reports cannot be reconciled.
        9.3.4.9.10. Category J (Other Accruals) – The supporting documentation for other
        accrual journal vouchers shall include a narrative explaining the basis for the accrual
        and any subsequent reversal (if required). This category includes fiscal year-end
        closing entries.
     9.3.4.10. A JV purpose statement need not be very long as long as the approving
     authority can understand the purpose of the transaction. If further explanation is needed,
     additional detail can be included on the computational worksheet.
     9.3.4.11. Some source document listings may be too large to print; therefore, a computer
     source file name should be included (e.g., the Excel file name) and, if used, the
     Commander's Resource Integration System (CRIS) query name and date ran. Bear in
     mind that this data listing must be reproducible or recorded on a CD Rom that is filed
     with the trial balance documents.
        9.3.4.11.1. At a minimum, the documents cited on the face of the JV should be
        attached, and any others that will enhance understanding and validation. If that
        supporting information is voluminous, electronic filing is allowed. The location of
        the transaction-level detail must be noted on the JV form, and should be easily
        reproduced. A specific list of supporting documentation for all JVs cannot be
        comprehensively created.
     9.3.4.12. All computations, if any, must be attached to the JV on a separate sheet. A
     more detailed explanation can also be included on the worksheets. The worksheet must
     be designed to enable easy validation and understanding of the computations. All source
     dollar values should be supported by an OLRV report: CRIS query data report, or other
     authoritative documentation. Bear in mind that the computational source data must be
     reproducible, that is, retrievable or found by another person at another time. OLRV
     reports are to have the date/time group clearly shown. CRIS query titles and column
     headings/line titles must be included along with the query date and an explanation
     description (if necessary).
     9.3.4.13. The JV must indicate where the JV and supporting documents are filed within
     the DFAS Columbus office. Copies of these final reports should also be filed at base
     level location. It is to be understood that the Cost Accounting Office has immediate and
     complete access to the JVs. The JV and supporting documents must be stored on site for
     at least six years.
 172                                                             AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


       9.3.4.14. Two signatures (preparer and approving official) are required for each JV.
       Digital signatures are permitted and need to be returned within 48 hours; however, JVs
       can be posted in the meantime so the process will not hold up trial balance processing
       and delivery.
          9.3.4.14.1. The person who prepares the JV must sign it before presenting it to the
          approving official. The JV preparer does not have the authority to approve their JV.
          However, this person can post the JV into the accounting system. The preparer’s
          signature block must be on the bottom left and include at least the signer’s name, title,
          office symbol, base, and email address. Example: Gene Poole, CDFM, General
          Ledger Accountant, AFMC                DFAS-JLLN/COHL, Hill                AFB      UT.
          Gene.poole@hill.af.mil
          9.3.4.14.2. Only approved and designated persons can review and approve the
          journal voucher according to the thresholds exhibited on Table 9.8 below. The
          approving official cannot be the JV preparer, but if necessary, can post the JV into the
          accounting system. Whether or not the JV is proper and valid is for the
          approving official to determine, not the preparer. The approving official will
          review the JV and attached documentation to make sure the proper GLAs are used,
          the debits and credits balance, the purpose of the JV is valid, all computations are
          clear and understandable, all necessary documents are attached and understandable,
          and the action, override, and category codes are included and correct. (This
          paragraph is not meant to be comprehensive. The approving official should
          understand that further information might be necessary before signing the JV
          document.) The approver’s signature block should be on the bottom right and include
          at least the signer’s name, title, office symbol, base, and email address. The approver
          cannot prepare the JV. Example: Anne Teak, CPA, General Ledger Accountant,
          AFMC DFAS-JLLN/COHL, Hill AFB UT. Anne.teak@hill.af.mil

          the JV number.

9.4. Required Monthly Manual JVs
   9.4.1. Following is a list of manual journal entries that the DFAS associate should post each
   month. This is not an all-inclusive list. New adjustments may be required, as well as
   currently required ones may no longer be needed.
      9.4.1.1. CIVPAY Disbursement. Civilian Pay Accounting Interface System (CPAIS)
      disburses bi-weekly payroll to all civilian employees. However, CPAIS does not
      interface into DIFMS so the disbursement cannot be automatically recorded which
      requires this manual JV. The data source is the EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY LISTING
      REPORT (CPAIS E4R6L) found in the Dayton CPAIS-E4 folder. This report is often
      verbally referred to as the R60. The needed report is usually published in OLRV (2 or 3
      days before payday). This is a permanent JV.
      9.4.1.2. CIVPAY Budgetary Correction. This entry is to correct mapping problems in
      DIFMS. The data source is the EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY LISTING REPORT (CPAIS
      E4R6L) found in the Dayton CPAIS-E4 folder and the CIVPAY DISBURSEMENT JV
      (see 9.4.1.1 above). This report is often verbally referred to as the R60. The needed
      report is usually published in OLRV (2 or 3 days before payday) and the CIVPAY
      Disbursement JV described in 9.4.1.1. This is a permanent JV.
      9.4.1.3. Funds Transfer-In or Out Proprietary Entry. This entry is to record the
      transfer of funds from or to another fund. The data source is a Non-expenditure Transfer
      Authorization for the Air Force Working Capital Funds (Standard Form 1151) from
      DFAS-CO Air Force Working Capital Funds Reporting Division. This is a permanent
      JV.
      9.4.1.4. Funds Transfer-In or Out Budgetary Entry. The budget side of the Funds
      Transfer In entry described in 9.4.1.3. The data source is a Non-expenditure Transfer
      Authorization for the Air Force Working Capital Funds (Standard Form 1151) from
      DFAS-CO Air Force Working Capital Funds Reporting Division. This is a permanent
      JV.
      9.4.1.5. CIVPAY Variance. During the accounting period, two or three payroll
      disbursement vouchers (see 9.4.1.1 above) are posted. However, the CIVPAY office
      may make some manual adjustments to the DCPS payroll record that DIFMS or the
      EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY LISTING REPORT (CPAIS E4R6L often referred to as the
      R60) will not have. These adjustments need to be added to DIFMS. This adjustment
      affects cash reconciliation. If the variance amount is not posted, then cash disbursements
      – operations will be wrong by the adjustment amount. Data source is the current month’s
      CIVPAY disbursement JVs and CRIS query with criteria of Source Name = STH
      Cumulative, Status Code = c or e, FC = the base’s fund code (e.g., 6L, 6M, and 6Z),
      MAFR Cd = B, DLT = M, and date range, first to the last date of the reporting month.
      This is a permanent JV.
      9.4.1.6. Rehired Civilian Annuitant. A rehired annuitant is a person who has retired,
      but was subsequently rehired. This person still receives his retirement annuity but also
      receives working pay (as if he had not retired). However, some of this person’s pay is
      covered by other funding. The objective of this adjustment is to reflect properly the
      Rehired Annuitant liability on the trial balance. Even though any month will have two or
176                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      three payroll disbursements, this adjustment is to be made only at the end of the month
      based on the last EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY LISTING REPORT (CPAIS E4R6L). This
      is a permanent JV.
      9.4.1.7. Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS)
      Reclassification. For better visibility of MOCAS obligations, this entry realigns an
      obligation amount from Accounts Payable Public – Contract Services – Public Estimated
      (GLAC 211042C1) to Accounts Payable Public – Major Maintenance Cost – Public
      Estimated (GLAC 211042C2) and Contract Holdbacks (GLAC 213000). The amounts
      moved to GLACs 211042C2 and 213000 are the outstanding MOCAS obligations. Data
      source is DFAS-CO supplied “MOCAS Accounts Payable Amounts To Be Recorded” for
      the Air Force (Incl TI97). The letter from Patrick T. Shine, Deputy Director, Operations,
      DFAS Arlington, and dated August 10, 2007; (Paragraph 9.13) provides additional
      information. This is a temporary JV.
      9.4.1.8. Monthly Debt Management Report (MDMR) Adj. This entry is to record
      contractor or vendor accounts receivable amounts that do not interface to DIFMS. Data
      source is a monthly spreadsheet provided from the Debt Management Office at DFAS-
      CO. This is a temporary JV.
      9.4.1.9. Employee Accounts Receivable. CSAG has civilian pay related accounts
      receivable recorded in Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS) and Defense Debt
      Management System (DDMS). DCPS collects debts owed by current DoD employees,
      while DDMS manages debts owed by separated employees. DIFMS does not currently
      have an interface with either of these systems for recording these accounts receivable
      debt. Data source is monthly Defense Debt Management System (DDMS) and DCPS
      reports provided by DFAS-CO. This is a temporary JV.
      9.4.1.10. Direct Labor Hours Memo. To facilitate dashboard reporting, this entry of
      direct labor hours (not dollars) is posted to the statistical section of the general ledger.
      Data source is the DIR TOT lines approximately midway through the DIFMS Direct
      Costs by Cost Center, Year-to-Date (7310-721) report. This is a permanent JV.
      9.4.1.11. In House Activity Retention Work. Any direct work performed by organic
      maintenance employees is loaded with overhead costs based upon the direct labor hours
      charged to the JON. The rate varies among the different shops or RCC’s. Part of the
      base’s workload is for internal customers. When direct labor employees charge their time
      to internal customer JONs, those hours are not reimbursable to the base by our external
      customers
         9.4.1.11.1. It is not appropriate accounting treatment to allocate the already allocated
         overhead to this in-house work. Because DIFMS does not generally segregate
         reporting by type of workload, those in-house JON’s accumulate this allocated
         overhead in the normal process. To enable departmental accounting to communicate
         the nature of this expense correctly, the YTD amount of activity retention is
         reclassifying entry between the “Applied Overhead – Production Expense” accounts.
         Data source is the 7310-977 report, below the line “ACTIVITY RETENTION”. This
         entry is input as a temporary JV, with the exception of fiscal year end.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                   177


     9.4.1.12. Unallocated Collections and Undistributed Disbursements (often referred
     to as the DIFMS/7113 Variance Adjustment). DIFMS cash balances are compared to
     the Monthly Package Report of Disbursement and Collection Transactions, RCS HAF-
     ACF (M) 7113 (7113). Because of monthly cutoff timing, some needed end-of-month
     collections and disbursements are still in transit and do not get posted into DIFMS. This
     entry is to record the impact of collection and disbursement transactions interfaced from
     GAFS that have not posted in the DIFMS database. Generally, these transactions are
     found in the transactional DFAS Integration Engine (DFIE) database. The DFIE is the
     intermediary system that translates GAFS data into DIFMS recognizable data. The
     rejected transactions are placed into a special file to allow manual editing and
     reprocessing. The journal entry data sources are the relevant general ledger accounts
     after the last cash run and the reporting month-end GAFS 7113 report.
     9.4.1.13. 1307 Report PART VI - Capital Investment Program Worksheet. This JV is
     to adjust DIFMS to reflect the capital asset transactions recorded in GAFS and in-house
     transactions within DIFMS. The data source for the 1307 Report PART VI – worksheet
     comes from H069/GAFS-BL/BQ provided by the base cost accounting office. This is a
     permanent JV.
     9.4.1.14. Capital Investment Program ADJ. It is assumed that of each dollar
     collected, a certain amount or percentage is to reimburse CSAG for use of its capital
     assets. This entry is to recognize collection of those funds. The data source is primarily
     the 1307 Part VI report used for the adjustment described above and the balances found
     in GLACs 101040A2 (normal Debit balance) and 101040B2 (normal Credit balance)
     after the Part VI adjustment (paragraph 9.4.1.13) has been posted. Essentially, 101040A2
     is forced to be the mirror amount of the balance in 101040B2. For example, if the
     balance in 101040B2 is a credit $10,000 and the balance in 101040A2 is a debit $8,000,
     then we adjust 101040A2 up by $2,000 by moving that amount from 101040A1. After
     the adjustment, 101040A2 will be a debit $10,000 and 101040B2 will be a credit
     $10,000. This is a permanent entry.
     9.4.1.15. Part VI Budget Realignment; this adjustment is the third adjustment based on
     the Part VI report. In this case, the adjustment is posted so that the total of budget
     accounts 490241Z (Expended Authority Paid Government Capital) and 490242Z
     (Expended Authority Paid Public Capital) equal the Part VI outlays for the current fiscal
     year (which should be the same number as found in GLAC 101040B2). The adjustment
     is made to 490242Z with the offset against 490242YX (Expended Authority Paid Public
     Operations Equipment). For example, if the Part VI report shows outlays of $20,000 then
     GLAC 101040A2 should be a debit balance of $20,000, GLAC 101040B2 should be a
     credit balance of $20,000 and the total credit balances of GLACs 490241Z and 490242Z
     should equal $20,000. This is a permanent entry.
     9.4.1.16. Automated Civil Engineer System (ACES)/Real Property is the system of
     record for tracking and maintaining individual real property asset records. An adjusting
     JV will be recorded in DIFMS by each ALC at the close of each month to bring the
     general ledger account balances in DIFMS into balance with the corresponding general
     ledger account balances in ACES-RP. (Adapted from instructions from HQ US Air
     Force Financial Reporting Guidelines for Air Force Working Capital Fund Real Property,
     Version 3, dated February 2009.) Data source is “Match DIFMS to ACES-RP”

       worksheet from HQ AFMC/FMP and RP – GLA Validation (PCN SF022-2090-
       V.2.0.0.0) report from the Automated Civil Engineer System at Gunter. This is a
       permanent JV.
       9.4.1.17. Non-Recoverable Depreciation. This journal voucher is to record
       depreciation for assets not factored into the sales rates that are charged to customers.
       These depreciable assets are known as unfunded costs because those assets are often
       transferred in at no cost from other organizations. However, the asset still has an
       economic value and this entry is to allocate this value in order to make the production
       better mirror real world costs. Data sources are “Match DIFMS to ACES-RP”
       worksheet, RP – GLA Validation (PCN SF022-2090-V.2.0.0.0) report from the
       Automated Civil Engineer System at Gunter, the DIFMS 7310-905, and the DIFMS
       7310-945 reports. This is a permanent JV.
       9.4.1.18. Undistributed Collections and Distributions of Treasury Transactions
       (often referred to as the 7136 Adjustment). The CSAG Fund Balances with Treasury
       (cash) accounts must match those reported in the Treasury reports. During the
       accounting period, all collection and disbursement transactions must be recorded with the
       Department of the Treasury before they pass to the H069/GAFS-BL/BQ system that then
       passes to DIFMS. However, due to the period end cutoff, not all transactions arrive in
       time to be recorded in H069/GAFS-BL/BQ or DIFMS. This journal voucher is to adjust
       the collection and disbursement fund balances for those transactions in transit.
           9.4.1.18.1. Infrequently, the 7136 Report does not arrive in time to post to DIFMS
           before the creation of the final DIFMS monthly trial balance. Consequently, the
           adjustment is recorded on the trial balance worksheet, but must be posted to DIFMS
           at the beginning of the following month. Data sources are the monthly Air Force
           Working Fund Cash Data Report, RCS: HAF-ACF (M) 7136 and 7113 reports. In the
           end, the total of GLAs 101040A1, 101040A2, and 101040A3 must equal the 7136
           total collections and GLAs 101040B1, 101040B2, and 101040B3 must equal the
           7136 total disbursements. Although not required, this is best accomplished if this
           manual entry is posted last. This is a permanent JV.
       9.4.1.18.2. Undistributed Collections and Distributions of Treasury Transactions
       7136 Budget Adjustment. The system is mapped to post the undistributed adjustment
       (Paragraph 9.4.1.18) to budget accounts automatically; however, budget-reporting
       requirements recently changed requiring the posting of this budget impact to new budget
       accounts. Until the DIFMS mapping can be corrected, this entry is to move the budget
       adjustment amounts from the incorrect to the correct budget accounts. This is a
       permanent entry.
9.5. Fiscal Year-End Manual Entries. At the end of each fiscal year, the books are closed in
preparation for the next year. Many closing entries are systemic; (see Paragraph 9.12) however,
the following are still manually accomplished. Most of the GLAs are revenue and expense
accounts but there are some closing entries for some asset or liability accounts. Theoretically,
normal debit balance accounts are closed to a normal credit balance closing account and vice
versa. In reality, some accounts will be negative; that is, a normal debit balance account will
have a credit balance, or a normal credit balance account will have a debit balance.
Consequently, the actual closing will depend on whether or not the account being closed is
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                    179


positive or negative. Also, when some entries are posted is critical. The manual closing entries
need to be posted before the systemic closing entry run stream is completed. Many of the
systemic closing entries are coded to meet the Navy's needs. Consequently, some of the manual
closing entries need to be posted before the systemic ones are recorded. All closing entries are
assigned Category Code J (Other Adjustments).
   9.5.1. Activity Retention. This JV is one of the monthly adjustment entries. For each
   month end, it is posted as auto-reversing. For September’s month end closing, the entry is to
   not auto-reverse. Later, when the closing entries are done, manually post the reversal.

9.7. Trial Balance Process. The trial balance and supporting reports are owned by the Air
Force, and these reports reflect the CSAG financial status as of the last day of the reporting
month. The Air Force is primarily responsible for the financial position on the reports.
However, the DFAS-CO associate must exert every effort to make sure the report is accurate,
relevant, and reliable. The following instructions can change because of system enhancement
and new methods. See paragraph 9.7.4. Reports.
   9.7.1. Monthly Reports. The trial balance, the footnotes, and the trading partners report are
   to be submitted after each month end. The trial balance is to be submitted no later than close
   of business of the fifth business day following the reporting month end. For example,
   December’s trial balance is due no later than 5 January. The footnotes and the trading
   partners report are to be submitted no later than end of business the sixth business day
   following the reporting month end.
   9.7.2. DIFMS updates the General Ledger (GL) with the transactions from other sub-
   systems and with manual JVs. The Air Logistics Complex (ALC) site scheduler runs the
   DIFMS Run Stream MS352J after every daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly
   processing. This job updates the general ledger and produces trial balance reports. MS495P
   can be scheduled at the same time that produces the DIFMS income statement.
       9.7.2.1. To assure the DIFMS financial database is correct and in balance, ALC Base
       Cost Accounting validates and reconciles DIFMS USSGL account information to assure
       all feeder transactions are/were processed to/from those systems correctly. This activity
       occurs on an on-going basis. Timely and thorough validation and reconciliation by the
       ALCs and DFAS assures accurate trial balance data is forwarded monthly to higher
       management levels.
       9.7.2.2. Analysis of the general ledger reports consists of the review of each individual
       General Ledger Account balance. The review determines whether there are abnormal
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                    187


     balances, out of balances between Subsidiary and General Ledger Control Accounts, out
     of balances between debits and credits, improperly processed adjustments during the
     month, and unusual changes in accounts from one month to the next. All problems are
     referred to the appropriate activity for resolution.
  9.7.3. DIFMS Month-End Processing. Month end processing starts with the schedule run
  on the last day of the month and continue for six business days at the base level.
     9.7.3.1. No later than the last calendar day of the month, AFSC cost accounting assures
     month-end audit billing is run through DIFMS Program MS273P “Produce Billing
     Audit”. The last calendar day of the month is the cut-off for labor and material cost
     interfacing from Time and Attendance (TAA) System and Naval Air Systems Command
     Industrial Material Management System (NIMMS).
     9.7.3.2. Once the last day of the month’s trial balance (MS352P) process has completed,
     DFAS personnel can begin posting the month-end adjusting JVs (see paragraph 9.4).
     Any cash JVs must wait until after the final cash interface for the trial balance currently
     being processed. Any needed adjustments not posted must be posted on the adjustment
     worksheet of the trial balance template.
     9.7.3.3. No later than the second calendar day of the subsequent month, AFSC cost
     accounting assures month-end final billing is run through DIFMS Program MS274P
     “Produce Customer Bills”.
     9.7.3.4. No later than the second calendar day of the subsequent month, AFSC cost
     accounting assures DIFMS ‘weekly prior to end-of-month’ schedule is run. The second
     calendar day of the subsequent month is also the cut-off for business operations, other
     expenses, and corrections in DIFMS.
     9.7.3.5. The trial balance run stream (MS352J) is scheduled each day to post the JVs
     formally to the database. No later than the evening of the third calendar day after the end
     of month, the final daily/monthly trial balance is to be run. Afterward, the database is
     rolled over to the new month. This final trial balance is used to ensure all correcting
     entries have been made and users detect no problems related to the general ledger account
     information. If no problems are found, this final trial balance is to be submitted as the
     official report. However, at times, data is not available for posting into DIFMS prior to
     the final month-end run. These adjustments should be added to the adjustment worksheet
     of the trial balance template and posted into GAFS-R as an auto-reverse entry. If the
     adjustment is to be permanent, it must be posted as a permanent JV in DIFMS
     immediately after the end of month. If the adjustment would have automatically
     reversed, the adjustment need not be posted to DIFMS.
  9.7.4. Reports
     9.7.4.1. The foundation of the trial balance is the DIFMS General Ledger Trial
     Balance(7310-935) found in OLRV. As explained in 9.7.2 above, this report is published
     at least daily, but can be produced several times a day to facilitate accuracy. It is
     downloaded into a trial balance template that is used to as a starting point for
     adjustments, validate balances, and report submission. Once the base finalizes its report,
     it is submitted by email to DFAS-CO, Air Force cost accounting, and other authorized
     offices. The report submitted to DFAS-CO is merged with other CSAG trial balances
188                                                             AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      into the Working Capital Fund Consolidated Depot Maintenance Statement of Financial
      Position (1307 report).
      9.7.4.2. The Trial Balance Template has at least two tabs (Excel file). The first tab is
      called the PROOF tab. There is a block at the bottom of this worksheet that shows
      whether or not the report is in balance. It is in three sections: overall, proprietary, and
      budgetary accounts. If the debts and credits are not equal, this block will show in which
      section the imbalance resides. The most common reason for an imbalance is a new
      account has been added to DIFMS but has not been added to the template.
      9.7.4.3. Proof Tab Described
         9.7.4.3.1. GLA. This column lists all the General Ledger Account Codes (GLAC) in
         ascending order starting with assets.
         9.7.4.3.2. DEBIT AND CREDIT. These columns contain debit or credit balances for
         each GLAC. The report shows all GLACs even if the amount is zero.
         9.7.4.3.3. IND. This column indicates whether the balance is a debit or credit
         balance. ‘1’ equals debit and ‘2’ equals credit.
         9.7.4.3.4. AMOUNT. This column shows the balance of the account. Combined
         with the “IND” code, this amount is either a debit or a credit amount. (The balances
         in this column must always be positive balances.)
         9.7.4.3.5. ABNORMAL BALANCES. The template is programmed to flag
         abnormal balanced accounts automatically.
         9.7.4.3.6. OK AT 6 POS. Computational column, do not make any changes.
         9.7.4.3.7. CUR BAL. Shows what the current balance is. D= Debit, C = Credit.
         This column is automatically compared to Column I “NORM BAL”.
         9.7.4.3.8. NORM BAL. This is the normal balance for the account. If the CUR BAL
         by GLA does not match, the ABNORMAL BALANCES COLUMN will flag the
         status.
         9.7.4.3.9. 7113 to 7136 proof balancing. DFAS is responsible for making sure the
         Fund Balance with Treasury accounts (GLACs 101040Ax and 101040Bx) in DIFMS
         agree with the 7136 Treasury report. On the Proof Sheet columns L and M to the
         right of the cash accounts is used for reconciliation. The GLAC amounts
         automatically appear in their respective cells but the 7136 amounts must be typed in.
         If the DIFF cell on the Proof Sheet is zero, the accounts are in balance.
             9.7.4.3.9.1. The CIP Proof fields just below the 7113 to 7136 reconciliation are to
             show if the CIP fund cash accounts (101040A2 and 101040B2) equal each other.
             If the DIFF cell on the Proof Sheet is zero, the accounts are in balance.
      9.7.4.4. Worksheet tab (WKSHT TAB) described.
         9.7.4.4.1. This worksheet is to facilitate report mechanics. First, the OLRV Excel
         formatted data is downloaded/copied to this tab that in turn, creates the Proof Trial
         balance. The formulas in the Proof Tab worksheet automatically copy over the GLA
         data from the 7310-951 report and align them in the proper place with correct
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                   189


        balances. Second, any JVs that need to be posted to the trial balance, but for some
        reason, did not get into DIFMS prior to the final trial balance run are posted on this
        worksheet. The worksheet has three sets of three related columns.
        9.7.4.4.2. GLA (1, 2, or 3) refers to General Ledger Account. This alphanumeric
        code represents a particular account. Note: the account numbers go from left to right
        rather than down. For example, GLA1 is 101040A1, GLA 2 is 101040A2, and GLA 3
        is 101040A3.
        9.7.4.4.3. SIGN (1 or 2) indicates whether the current balance is a debit “1” or credit
        “2” balance. (However, the amounts all show as positive).
        9.7.4.4.4. AMT (1 or 2) is the current dollar value in the account. Note: that the
        values are expressed without commas, but changing the number format to include the
        commas does not affect the workbook calculations.
        9.7.4.4.5. COLUMNS J, etc. Starting with Column J and going right, any manual
        JVs that were not previously posted into DIFMS are entered in these columns.
        However, the adjustment amounts do not automatically post to the relevant cells on
        the left. The amount cells must be arithmetically modified to accept the adjustment.
        In addition, the General Ledger Account is to post these journal entries to GAFS-R.
        This will allow better processing for DFAS-CO. Regardless, posting to the worksheet
        tab trial balance should still be done before posting the GAFS-R. This will ensure the
        report will be accurate.
     9.7.4.5. The Footnote Report has explanatory data that relate and further explain the
     fiscal information of the trial balance. Footnotes augment full disclosure by providing
     further information regarding accounting policies, problems, and other disclosures
     required by higher-level users.
        9.7.4.5.1. HEADING. The heading should be:
            9.7.4.5.1.1. FOOTNOTES FOR XX-ALC
            9.7.4.5.1.2. CONSOLIDATED SUSTAINMENT ACTIVITY GROUP
            9.7.4.5.1.3. GENERAL LEDGER TRIAL BALANCE
            9.7.4.5.1.4. AS OF (DATE)
        9.7.4.5.2. ABNORMAL BALANCES. Accounts with abnormal balances are listed
        in this section. The GLAC, GLAC Title, abnormal balance (shown as positive),
        Normal Balance (if the normal balance is debit, then the amount listed is actually a
        credit balance), a causal explanation, and what action, if needed, will be taken to
        correct the problem.
        9.7.4.5.3. FUND BALANCES WITH TREASURY. Two items are to be reported in
        this section. Each is to show a twelve-month running history. Delete the oldest line
        at the top, and then add a new line at the bottom for the reporting month.
            9.7.4.5.3.1. Undistributed Collection and Disbursement Transactions.
            Reconciliation between Defense Industrial Financial Management System
            (DIFMS) to Monthly Package of Disbursements and Collections Transactions
            (RCS: HAF-ACF (M) 7113 (7113). After the month-end cutoff, collection and
190                                                           AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


            disbursement Fund Balances with Treasury (FBWT) are compared between the
            DIFMS and the General Accounting and Finance System (H069/GAFS-BL/BQ).
            Any difference is generally due to GAFS-BL/BQ transactions that have not
            interfaced into DIFMS. These transactions are in the Integration Engine because
            of data element problems. For proper reporting, a manual journal voucher is
            posted for the difference. (see para. 9.4.1.12)
            9.7.4.5.3.2. Fund Balance Collection and Disbursement Transactions in Transit.
            The cash collections & disbursements balances of the Air Force Working Capital
            Fund Cash Data Report (RCS: HAF-ACF (M) 7136) and the Monthly Package of
            Disbursements and Collections Transactions (RCS: HAF-ACF (M) 7113) are
            compared to the CSAG Trial Balance cash balances to ensure all three systems
            match. (see para. 9.4.1.18)
         9.7.4.5.4. PROBLEMS WITH PROCESSING FOR THE MONTH. Use this area to
         explain any significant processing problems that may have occurred that affected the
         report’s accuracy or timeliness, or any other problems.
         9.7.4.5.5. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES.                  Explain in concise but
         sufficient detail the change and its impact.
         9.7.4.5.6. TRANSFERS IN AND OUT. Bases and base organizations will
         occasionally give an asset to another base or organization. (For example, the item is
         no longer needed by one organization while another can use it). Transfers-out to one
         organization should be recorded as a transfer-in to another. These transfers affect
         Trading Partners reporting because the transferring organization’s assets have
         decreased while the recipient organization’s assets have increased. DFAS-CO needs
         to make an elimination entry to adjust the report balances for proper consolidation.
         Unless sufficient information is provided, the consolidating accountant cannot make a
         proper and accurate elimination entry. The sales code, asset description, amount,
         losing and gaining organization, and other information should be included. This
         report may become rather large. Therefore, it is allowable to submit it as a separate
         Excel spreadsheet.
         9.7.4.5.7. OTHER DISCLOSURES. DIFMS has several “Other” or miscellaneous
         types of accounts. DFAS-CO needs information for Advances from Customers by
         Sales Code (GLACs 231041A/B), Progress Billings by Sales Codes (GLAC
         152600A2), Other Structures and Facilities (GLAC 1740XX), Other Assets (GLAC
         1990XX), and Other Financing Sources (GLAC 5790XX). There may be additional
         “Other” accounts that may require explanation. If the account has a balance in it,
         provide the amount and explanation.
         9.7.4.5.8. POINT OF CONTACT. The last item should be the Point of Contact
         (POC) that is the producer of the report, the General Ledger Accountant.
  9.7.5. Trading Partners Report. This report is to facilitate the consolidation elimination
  process done by DFAS-CO. The report lists the base’s government and public accounts
  receivables and revenue by sales code. The accounts receivable overall total must equal the
  total of Accounts Receivable - Government Agencies - Summary Billings (GLAC 131041A).
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     191


   The revenue column must equal the total of all trial balance revenue accounts (GLACs
   5200XXX).
9.8. Internal General Ledger Balancing
   9.8.1. Each month ensure that the trial balance is in balance in total for all USSGL accounts:
   budgetary (4000 series), memorandum (8000 and 9000 series), and operating (all other
   series).
      9.8.1.1. Verify the account balances reported on the trial balance (from DIFMS File
      MS381C02) are equal to those reported on DIFMS Report 7310-915 “General Ledger
      Details Year to Date” and 7310-935 “General Ledger Trial Balance Report”. Use
      DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS044P “General Ledger Journal Voucher” for further research
      into individual JV(s).
      9.8.1.2. On some occasions, the DIFMS Report 7310-935 is out of balance due to new
      accounts not being hard-coded. This can easily be determined by viewing DIFMS Report
      7310-925 “General Ledger Worksheet”. If the DIFMS Report 7310-925 is balanced,
      certain accounts on the DIFMS Report 7310-935 need to be hard-coded so they appear on
      the report. If an account does not appear, Defense Finance and Accounting Service
      Information and Technology (DFAS I&T) must be contacted for any correction via a
      Remedy ticket or a Software Change Request (SCR), as appropriate.
      9.8.1.3. DIFMS Report 7310-935 can be used to ensure that total debits equal total
      credits. It is systemically totaled by proprietary account total, budgetary account total,
      statistical account total, and overall total. In the variance column, the report will show
      the out-of-balance amount. The totals for each subsection will reflect where the out-of-
      balance is occurring. Since the 7310-935 report is produced daily, the out-of-balance
      condition will remain until it is corrected.
          9.8.1.3.1. To find the out-of-balance, first check the older reports to determine when
          the out-of-balance first occurred. Secondly, check the 7310-945 "DIFMS Processed
          Journal Vouchers Current Cycle" for that day to determine if any JV is out-of-
          balance. Third, go to the subsidiary ledger report for the out-of-balance JV type and
          review the data. An SQL correction may have to be processed against the database.
          All SQLs should be documented as a Remedy ticket and coordinated with DFAS
          I&T.
   9.8.2. Subsidiary to General Ledger Balancing. To confirm all data is correct and reported
   the proper way, perform the following balancing procedures as needed.
      9.8.2.1. Use DIFMS Report 7310-965 “Automated Balancing” to review the subsidiary
      balance and general ledger balance for each USSGL account number. This report
      provides the general ledger account number, balance, debit/credit indicator, reference
      report number, subsidiary balance, and amount of variance. General ledger users must
      review the 7310-965 report after a weekly run with a Cost Summary process to obtain a
      true picture of any potential out of balance. Keeping up with the report allows for a much
      easier investigation when variances do appear.
      9.8.2.2. Variances found on DIFMS Report 7310-965 are attributed to problems between
      the general and the subsidiary ledgers. The first step to investigate a variance on DIFMS
 192                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


       Report 7310-965 involves identifying the DIFMS subsystem that generated the subsidiary
       amount. The general ledger user should look at the report that produced the journal
       voucher that posted to the general ledger accounts. Note: Some variances will exist due
       to manual processes (e.g., ACES to DIFMS reconciliation) and these variances should
       not be corrected. To correct variances in the DIFMS subsystem subsidiary amount, the
       appropriate system POC must be contacted.
            9.8.2.2.1. For example, when balancing expense accounts, the user first compares all
            current cycle subsystem reports that contain updates to the respective cost columns on
            DIFMS Reports 7310-780 “Indirect Current Cycle Cost” and 7310-781 “Direct
            Current Cycle Cost”.
       9.8.2.3. The following DIFMS reports may contain updates to cost:

Table 9.30. Cost Detail Reports
 Report                 Title
 7310-321               Corrected Unallocated and Unmatched Details
 7310-335               Cash Receipts Register
 7310-340               Cash Disbursement Register
 7310-424               Weekly Material Expenditures Summary by Expense Count
 7310-461               Transactions Clearing Requisition Status
 7310-506               Manage Facilities Additions, Changes, Deletions
 7310-514               Monthly Depreciation
                        Labor Distribution Summary by Expense Account Report
 7310-558
                        Reconciliation
 7310-565               Labor Distribution Summary by Expense Account
 7310-605               Schedule of Accruals
 7310-694               Contract Labor Transfers
 7310-960               Cost Adjustments by Expense Account
       9.8.2.4. After determining the causes of subsidiary to general ledger imbalances,
       corrections to be made depend where the error is.
       9.8.2.5. If the problem exists in the subsidiary ledger, it may be possible to reverse the
       incorrect entry, and to re-enter the correct information.
            9.8.2.5.1. A manual JV can be done to adjust the general ledger only. A manual entry
            cannot correct the subsidiary ledgers.
            9.8.2.5.2. System Query Language (SQL) updates are mainly used to adjust the
            subsidiary ledger only. (See Chapter 1, Paragraph 1.8.10 through 1.8.10.4.) SQLs
            must be coordinated with the local AFSC/FZR and entered as a Remedy ticket for
            DFAS I&T to work. This should be done as a last resort. After the SQL is posted,
            review the general ledger for any possible impact and create a Manual JV (if
            appropriate).
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                      193


          9.8.2.5.3. If a write-off must occur, a General Ledger Account (GLA)-type Job Order
          Number (JON) can be created using the DIFMS Update Screen MS151P linked to the
          USSGL account that is out of balance. Then a cost transfer via DIFMS Update
          Screen MS144P can be processed from the GLA-type JON to an expense JON.
   9.8.3. End of year balancing between Funding Initiation Tool (FIT) System and DIFMS.
      9.8.3.1. DIFMS currently runs a year-end process to move all Customer Order Number
      (CON) funding dollars to a prior year balance field. The dollar amounts stored in the
      funds authorized total of the customer order record reflect only the dollars for the present
      year. Note: That the amounts stored on the funding document and the sponsor order
      reflects the total for all years. DIFMS and FIT roll current year to prior year funding
      during the year-end process.
      9.8.3.2. DIFMS is the official financial record for CSAG and thus the financial data in
      DMAPS Data Store System (DDS) must be made to agree with DIFMS. Balancing DDS
      with DIFMS is important to assure the users of DDS data refer to the correct, up-to-date
      information and systems using DDS data, such as Cost and Production Budget Module
      (H033/CPBM) and Sales Price Generator System (SPG) have the correct information to
      support their processes. H033 provides consistent formats for the financial and
      production tracking reports in the CPBM. SPG uses tables in the DDS database for
      generation of sales prices. For the most part, reconciliation should be automated as the
      business rules assure data synchronization. However, manual JVs processed to change
      account balances or SQL changes to DIFMS data will not flow to DDS. These changes
      will need to be reconciled manually.
9.9. Policy For Prior-Period Adjustments For a Previous Fiscal Year
   9.9.1. A prior-period adjustment to a previous fiscal year can only be recorded with the
   approval of the Secretary of Air Force (SAF). Appropriate documentation must be submitted
   in a package to SAF for their consideration.
   9.9.2. Do not make prior-period adjustments for material accounting principle changes;
   unless adjustments are otherwise specified in the implementing instructions, or if the changes
   are from an unacceptable to an acceptable accounting method. Report the cumulative effect
   of the change in prior periods as a change in accounting principle in the trial balance's
   footnotes. Adjust the beginning balance of cumulative results of operations in the Statement
   of Changes in Net Position for the period in which the change is posted (e.g., current year
   transaction). Present the prior-year financials without the change.
   9.9.3. If an ALC discovers any material error or misstatement after the financial statements
   have been issued, the ALC must seek approval from AFMC/FM to post prior-period
   adjustments. AFMC/FM in turn seeks approval from the Defense Finance and Accounting
   Service (DFAS) through Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management and
   Comptroller (SAF/FM). Coordination must also occur with the local Air Force Audit
   Agency office. The following documentation must accompany the request:
      9.9.3.1. Sufficient documentation to support an audit.
      9.9.3.2. An explanation of how the amount was determined to be material.
      9.9.3.3. An explanation of what caused the omission or misstatement.
 194                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


       9.9.3.4. A statement of what the original entries were, what the original entries should
       have been, and the proposed correcting entries.
       9.9.3.5. Documentation showing coordination with the Air Force Audit Agency.
       9.9.3.6. Upon approval, the adjustment package goes to DFAS-CO for posting. The final
       arbiter of disputes is the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense, Comptroller, Director
       of Accounting and Finance Policy and Analysis (AFPA).
       9.9.3.7. AFSC/FM       and AFMC/FM assure sufficient display and disclosure of
       information regarding prior period adjustments in the footnotes to the financial
       statements. These offices also assure the prior-year financial statements are restated at
       the next issuance of statements. If an account balance changes because a valuation
       method has changed, footnote the change in valuation method but do not restate prior
       period financial statements.
   9.9.4. Table 9.31 shows type expense data elements for DIFMS expense accounts. The
   reference list of object classes follows. Object class is a category in the line of accounting to
   specify how the funds are being expended in order to report to the Office of Management and
   Budget (OMB) and to Congress. It is input per the defined purpose of the expenditure.
9.10. Quality Assurance. For quality assurance and to ensure accurate and dependable
financial statements, manual journal entries will be reviewed semiannually by a management
appointee. Data from the review is to be analyzed and reported to the person responsible for
daily operations (PRDO), DFAS-Columbus Account Maintenance & Control, Acquisition and
Depot Maintenance Working Capital Funds accountant at HQ AFMC/FMR.
   9.10.1. One third of all manual journal entries are to be reviewed. The JVs to be review are
   to be selected randomly from the full universe of all manual JVs by base. If the base has 100
   manual journal entries, then 33 of them are to be reviewed.
   9.10.2. Any discrepancies are to be investigated and corrected. Training is to be provided to
   ensure the errors are not repeated. Training is the responsibility of the PRDO.
   9.10.3. Following is the checklist of characteristics to be reviewed and the manual JV should
   be corrected:
       9.10.3.1. Is the Official DIFMS produced JV number sequential and annotated in lower
       right corner of the document?
       9.10.3.2. Do the GLAC titles match the GLA codes?
       9.10.3.3. Do the JV debit and credit totals equal?
       9.10.3.4. If the transaction is to be automatically systemically reversed does the JV have
       a statement indicating so?
       9.10.3.5. Does the JV include the appropriate category (or reason) code?
       9.10.3.6. Is the JV's file location included?
       9.10.3.7. Has the person who prepared the JV document included in his/her signature
       block sufficient contact information, minimally his/her name, title, office symbol, and
       email address?
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     195


      9.10.3.8. Has the approving official included his/her signature block that includes his/her
      name, title, office symbol, and email address?
      9.10.3.9. Did the appropriate official approve the JV according to published thresholds?
      (See Table 9.8)
      9.10.3.10. Was the approving official not the preparer?
      9.10.3.11. Was the JV posting done by a DFAS associate?
      9.10.3.12. Following the JV posting, was the JV reviewed to make sure it was posted
      correctly?
      9.10.3.13. Is all-pertinent data entered into the JV log?
      9.10.3.14. Has Privacy Act Information been properly dealt with?
      9.10.3.15. Is the data source (reports, worksheets, etc.) written on the JV with
      appropriate titles and dates?
      9.10.3.16. Is the purpose statement clear and concise?
      9.10.3.17. Are the adjustment amounts correct and supportable?
      9.10.3.18. Is sufficient supporting documentation attached to the JV, or if prohibitively
      large, easily accessible? (If the supporting data is voluminous, a summary of the data
      should be attached to the JV.)
   9.10.4. Review documentation should be maintained for six years at each base with the

                                        Chapter 10

            MANAGEMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT

10.1. Introduction
   10.1.1. Policies and procedures that control the Capital Investment Program (CIP) are
   contained in AFMCI 21-109, Air Force Depot Maintenance Activity Group Facilities and
   Equipment, and DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter 6.
      10.1.1.1. The depot maintenance portion of the Working Capital Fund (WCF) is
      authorized to fund the acquisition of certain capital purchases through the CIP and
      operating budget. Capital purchase acquisitions differ significantly from other depot
      maintenance expenditures in the methods used for accounting, budgeting, and processing
      requests. The impact of capital investment acquisitions also causes a different effect on
      the financial statements, and on the execution of annual operating plans. Differences
      between capital investment and other expenditures are explained in the following
      paragraphs.
      10.1.1.2. The normal accounting procedures for expenditures require the recording of
      expenses, as services or products are received. Accounting procedures for capital
      expenditure requires spreading (depreciating) the actual cost of asset over the months of
      prescribed useful life. This accounting process provides basis for matching revenues
      generated through use of capital assets with an associated expense. On the budget side,
      DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 3, Chapter 19 sets the expense/investment threshold for
      Capital Purchase at $250,000. While the budgetary capitalization threshold was raised,
      Comptroller OSD requires assets between $100,000 and $250,000 be recorded in the
      Department’s financial reports as fixed assets and depreciated in accordance with the
      DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 9.
      10.1.1.3. The budget process normally requires an estimate of the cost of services or
      products to be received and consumed during given Fiscal Years (FY). With capital
      assets, the budget process requires an estimate of requirements for each year, and the
      annual depreciation expense associated with capital assets. Funds are obligated when a
      legal binding contract or agreement is established, which requires the expenditure of
      depot maintenance funds when products or services are received. The budget for
      expenses requires the computation of depreciation of assets based on acquisition costs
      and designated useful life of at least two years. (DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 9,
      June 2010)
      10.1.1.4. The processing of requirements for capital assets differs from expenses because
      of accounting and budgeting requirements. For expenses, the financial concern is to
      record the transaction at the time the product or service was received. With capital
      assets, the primary concerns are when the obligation occurs, payment is made and the
      asset is put into service.
      10.1.1.5. The immediate impact from a financial statement viewpoint upon a capital
      asset acquisition is a conversion of one asset (cash) into another asset (capital asset).
      This conversion only affects the balance sheet creating a requirement to reserve cash (an
 204                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


       asset) to satisfy payment for item received. The expense transaction converts cash asset
       to an expense affecting both balance sheet and the income statement.
   10.1.2. CIP funded fixed assets fall within six categories: (1) Equipment-Weapon System
   Sustainment (WSS), (2) Equipment Test, (3) Minor Construction, (4) Software Development,
   and (5) ADPE/Hardware.
10.1.3. An additional category of assets includes Facilities built with Military Construction
(MILCON) dollars and contributed to the CSAG organization for their use. Resource
requirements for these categories are rolled up at the ALC and Headquarters (HQ) Air Force
Materiel Command (AFMC) level to facilitate Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and
budget exercises, as well as to provide a reporting mechanism. DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume
2B, Chapter 9 states investments of $1,000,000 or greater require economic analysis (EA).
Requirements for conducting an Economic Analysis (EA) are specifically covered over $1M in
AFI 65-501 and AFMAN 65-506, Economic Analysis. Additionally, in the case of the Capital
Investment Program, a Cost Analysis (CA), or EA is required for projects less than $1M (see
AFMCI 21-109).
       10.1.3.1. Recognize capital assets in both the property (accountability) and financial
       records (accounting). The Automated Civil Engineering System - Real Property (F023 -
       ACES-RP) records accountability for real property items and the Air Force Equipment
       Management System (C001-AFEMS) is the property accountability system for other
       capital investments. ACES is the system of record for real property. DIFMS is the
       financial system for establishing fixed asset job orders and maintaining financial data.
   10.1.4. The DIFMS Fixed Asset function collects fixed assets costs for procurement,
   installation, and modification through uniquely structured job order numbers. Fixed Assets
   also updates plant account records, creates journal vouchers and posts to general ledger
   accounts, computes and processes monthly depreciation expense, and provides reports of
   financial data and status of fixed assets. The DIFMS Fixed Asset function accomplishes the
   following:
       10.1.4.1. Collect Fixed Assets costs for procurement, installation, and modification
       through uniquely structured Job Order Number (JON).
       10.1.4.2. Update Plant Account Records.
       10.1.4.3. Correct Suspense Records using Fixed Asset screens.
       10.1.4.4. Create Journal Vouchers and post to General Ledger Accounts.
       10.1.4.5. Compute and process Monthly Depreciation Expense.
       10.1.4.6. Provide reports of financial data (costs) and status of Fixed Assets, including
       information passed to the DMAPS Data Store System (DDS).

10.2. Accounting for Capital Investments
   10.2.1. Classify as capital investments; the development, manufacture, transfer, and
   acquisition of all capital assets for the primary use or benefit of depot maintenance. This
   includes data processing and telecommunications equipment as well as minor construction
   not exceeding the dollar threshold for funding in the Military Construction program.
   10.2.2. Classify software as capital investments including system programs, application
   programs, Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software, independent subroutines, databases,
   and software documentation. This includes software development or acquisition for the
   general benefit of depot maintenance but does not include software developed or acquired for
   a specific customer. Software developed or acquired for a specific customer should be
   charged to and reimbursed by the requesting customer.
   10.2.3. Capitalize and report in financial records all assets developed, manufactured,
   transferred, or acquired by depot maintenance including computer software purchased or
   developed, when the following criteria are met:
   10.2.4. Acquisition cost, book value, or, when applicable, the estimated fair market value
   equals, or exceeds, the expense/investment accounting threshold ($100,000 for
   Equipment/ADPE; $20,000 for Minor Construction). The budgeting threshold for CIP is
   $250,000 for Equipment/ADPE..
      10.2.4.1. Estimated benefit period or useful life to depot maintenance of 2 years or more.
      Note: the required depreciation schedule for capital assets is 5, 10, or 20 years.
      10.2.4.2. Acquisition cost is the original purchase or development cost including
      transportation, design, installation, implementation, and other related costs necessary to
      put the asset in the place and form in which it shall be used. Capital investment costs
      financed in the minor construction portion of the capital budget include project planning
      and design costs associated with minor construction projects. Planning and design costs
      are not included as part of the statutory threshold for minor construction projects.
      10.2.4.3. Software costs must be clearly identifiable with new software projects
      distinguishable from recurring maintenance-type activities. Include costs incurred after
      technological feasibility has been established. Include direct costs of developing major
      new software, initial training material, and documentation manuals incurred after
      technological feasibility has been established.
      10.2.4.4. Capital assets transferred to depot maintenance from another DoD activity shall
      be capitalized at original acquisition cost, or reasonable estimate, plus any associated
      costs for transportation, installation, and other related costs necessary to put the asset in
      the place and in the form in which it shall be used. If such assets have been previously
      depreciated, use the book value as the acquisition cost according to DoD FMR 7000.14-
      R, Volume 4, Chapter 6.
   10.2.5. Each ALC establishes or changes asset records in DIFMS and performs ongoing
   maintenance for CIP purchases in the Fixed Asset Job Order Numbers (F-JON) and the Plant

   Property records. These actions occur in the DIFMS Fixed Asset module. The AFSC
   FZR/FM) and Maintenance Wing Financial Managers organizations assure assets are
   properly capitalized or expensed based on policy in this document as well as the DoD FMR
   7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter 6.
10.2.6. Capital Investment Program Authority is recorded in GAFS-R per the Air Force
Working Capital Fund Annual Operating Budget (AOB). The total CSAG-Maintenance amount
must agree to the AOB total. Beginning in FY12, this will be recorded directly in DIFMS. The
United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Accounts used for the capital program
authority are 403200- Anticipated Contract Authority (debit entry) and 461040B - Allotments -
Realized Resources - Capital (credit entry). The Capital Investment Program Authority is added
to the budgetary accounts in DIFMS Job Order / Customer Order (JOCO) subsystem via DIFMS
Screen MS755P “Fiscal Year Budget Authorization Update”. Users enter budget authority in the
Projected-Budget-Amount field based on Budget Authority (BA) received from AFMC/FM.
Enter revised budget authority in the “Approved-Budget-Amount” field, if needed. Note: In
DIFMS, the MS755P screen does not currently produce any journal vouchers in the subsystem.
The work-a-round is for the General Ledger Accounts Administrator at each base to prepare a
Manual Journal Voucher to enter the AOB to add to the General Ledger Accounts.
       10.2.6.1. Establish a Sponsor Order Number (SPON) for the yearly Budget Authority
       (BA) for each of the CIP Programs (ADP Equipment, Software, Minor Construction, Test
       Equipment, and WSS Equipment. Establish the SPON records via DIFMS Screen
       MS154P “Funding Document Update”. The DIFMS Screen MS154P is the initial point
       of entry into DIFMS for all CIP funding. The document number, funds authorized, and
       various codes are entered in DIFMS Screen MS154P. Use of Order Type Code (OTC)
       ‘A’ prevents the Billing Subsystem from generating a bill. DIFMS automatically
       generates a “dummy” line of accounting using ACRN ‘XX’ for each SPON.
       10.2.6.2. A Customer Order Number (CON) is established as Control Symbol Number
       (CSN) for each funded project. Establish the CON records via DIFMS Screen MS153P
       “Customer Identification Update”. After the SPON is set up using the DIFMS Screen
       MS154P “Funding Document Update” for the year, applicable CONs for that program
       can be established using DIFMS Screen MS153P screen. The DIFMS Screen MS153P
       establishes or updates customer order identification data.
       10.2.6.3. When modifying the CIP CON, use DIFMS Screens MS154P or MS153P to
       change/modify all information except funds authorized. Use DIFMS Screen MS156P
       “Funds Authorized Update” to adjust, correct, or move initially established funds
       authorized information entered on DIFMS Update Screens MS154P and MS153P.
       DIFMS requires at least one CON be established in each capability prior to use of
       DIFMS Screen MS156P “Funds Authorized Update”. Use the top of the DIFMS Update
       Screen MS156P for updating individual CON processing within a SPON.

       10.2.6.4. The SPON(s) and CONs provide the DIFMS funding chain for establishing
       Fixed Assets Job Order Number (F-JON) for each project. Use DIFMS Screen MS114P
       “Fixed Assets (FA) Job Order Number (JON) Update” to establish the F-JONs in the
       Fixed Asset subsystem. Establish an F-JON for each project under a CSN within each
       CIP program. F-JONs have three job types: 1 = Procurement, 2 = Installation, and 3 =
       Modification to Existing Equipment. While F-JON is open, one may charge labor,
       material, overhead, and/or contractual business operations costs, as appropriate. These
       records are used to reconcile DIFMS fixed assets under development account with
       General Accounting and Finance System/Base Level (GAFS/BL) and the CIP folders.
       Users can also use DIFMS Update Screen MS114P to move F-JONs from one CON to
       another, if costs do not exist.

           10.2.6.5. DIFMS Update Screen MS114P allows additions of new F-JONs, changes to
           the data elements of existing fixed asset job order records, and closure of an F-JONs. F-
           JONs do not exist in the Job Order Production Master System (JOPMS-G004L) and are
           strictly internal to DIFMS. Additionally, this screen and DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS071P
           “FA Job Order Number” allow the user to inquire on existing F-JONs. DIFMS Screen
           MS114P allows reopening of F-JONs to process trailing costs and credits as long as F-
           JONs have not been purged from the database.
           10.2.6.6. DIFMS Screen MS114P also allows use of an ‘Installation F-JON’ (FA-JON-
           Type ‘2’) to collect Installation cost on Class ‘6’ (Software Account Codes ‘46’ and ‘56’)
           items separately. DIFMS Update Screen MS115P “Fixed Asset Land Building Software
           Plant Account Record (PAR)” also allows an ‘Installation F-JON’ to be entered for those
           Account Codes. DIFMS Program MS217P “Transfer Under Development Cost to Fixed
           Asset Accounts” looks for and processes ‘Installation F-JONs’ and associated costs for
           those Account Codes as well as related ‘Installation Costs’ within the General Ledger
           Posting Condition. DIFMS Process MS224P “Fixed Asset Plant Account Update” sends
           ‘Installation’ cost for these items forward to the DIFMS Report 7310-501 “Fixed Assets”.
           Use of DIFMS Screens MS114P and M115P allows the user to separately track and
           collect installation costs on these items rather than having the costs combined under the
           procurement F-JON.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                   209


   10.2.7. The initial costs under the F-JON are treated as direct cost but moved via DIFMS
   Program MS215P “Transfer Direct Costs To Under Development” from direct expense to
   Construction in Process (CIP) periodically to await the asset becoming operational.
      10.2.7.1. Commitments established for CIP cost for non in-house work is captured by
      posting contractual other related cost via DIFMS Update Screen MS112P “Asset
      Liability”. See Chapter 5 for more information. Obligations and disbursements are
      interfaced through H069/GAFS-BL/BQ.

          Symbol Number (CSN) is positions 2-7 of the cost code. The cost code is in JON
          field. Use a Contractual Other Code (COC) of “38” (3rd and 4th positions of CSN
          field) for all CIP work. Following the LOA, record the F-JON.

          to differentiate different contracts on the same CIP CSN.
          10.2.7.1.3. Cost for In-House Work. Labor is recorded daily through Time and
          Attendance (TAA) System to the CIP F-JON. DIFMS calculates the hours times the
          pay rate for recording labor costs; these costs are accelerated for leave and fringe
          benefits. Overhead (Production and General) is applied based on an applied rate per
          shop in relation to hours worked that day (regular and overtime, if applicable).
          Applied overhead is posted to the USSGL WIP and Applied Overhead based on these
          labor calculations.
             10.2.7.1.3.1. The ‘LD’ Journal Voucher (JV) does these postings supported by
             the DIFMS Report 7310-565 “Labor Distribution Summary by Expense
             Account”. This report is by shop.
             10.2.7.1.3.2. DIFMS Report 7310-560 “Direct Labor Distribution Summary by
             Job Order” for the same period, shows the same data by F-JON. The FA process
             moves the applied overhead amount recorded in Work in Process (WIP) in
             USSGL account 152600A1, Inventory - Work in Process - In House, to the CIP

             accounts (172000B, C or D) weekly, and at month end. The ‘FU’ Journal
             Voucher posts these amounts. The ‘FU’ JV also moves any CIP labor, material,
             contractual and business operations costs from the USSGL account 610000X2,
             Equipment - Direct.      DIFMS Report 7310-510 “Direct Cost to Under
             Development”, 610000/172000, shows the details for the ‘FU’ JV. To determine
             the amount of overhead applied to the in house CIP work, the sum of the ‘FU’
             JVs posted to 152600A1 can be used.
             10.2.7.1.3.3. CIP work performed in house is not included in the WIP or 6100
             series accounts. The overhead applied is in the USSGL accounts 660000A,
             Applied Overhead - Production Expense, and 660000B, Applied Overhead -
             General Expense. Applied Overhead – CIP In House Projects is transferred from
             660000A and 660000B to 660000C, “Activity Retention for NOR Calculation”.
          10.2.7.1.4. DIFMS Report 7310-512 “Assets under Development” shows the costs
          held in account. ADP Software (In House) and ADP Equipment (Hardware/CDA)
          post to USSGL account 172000C, Construction in Progress - Assets under
          Development - Software Systems. Minor Construction posts to USSGL account
          172000D, Construction in Progress - Assets under Development - Minor
          Construction. Other Equipment posts to USSGL account 172000B, Construction in
          Progress - Assets under Development - Purchased Assets. Management Initiatives
          and In-House post to USSGL accounts based on the type of initiative.

   modification, or installation of a fixed asset. Once the asset is linked to the F-JON, the Plant
   Account Number (PAN) begins appearing on DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS071P, FA Job Order
   Number Inquiry, DIFMS Update Screen MS114P “FA Job Order Number Update” and
   DIFMS Report 7310-512 “Assets under Development”. Establish the custody shop as the
   shop where depreciation is recorded. Set the estimated useful life per DoD FMR 7000.14-R
   in the ‘Original Estimated Life’ field. Use the same account code from the F-JON and enter
   an ‘operational date’ on or before the current date. To inquire on PARs, use DIFMS Inquiry
   Screen MS072P “FA Plant Account Record”.

   10.2.9. Modification of existing assets
      10.2.9.1. Costs which either extend the useful life of existing general Property Plant and
      Equipment (PP&E), or enlarge or improve its capacity shall be capitalized and
      depreciated/amortized over the remaining useful life of the associated general PP&E.
      Improvements shall be depreciated over the standard recovery periods provided per the
      DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter 6. Improvements that do not increase an
      asset's capacity, size, efficiency, or useful life, shall be expensed.
      10.2.9.2. For purchased assets, create a modification F-JON (FA job type ‘3’) using
      DIFMS Update Screen MS114P “FA Job Order Number”. To modified F-JON to the
      existing asset, use DIFMS Update Screens MS115P “FA Land, Buildings, Software
      PAR” or MS116P “FA Equipment Other PAR”. Upon closing the modified F-JON, the
      assets value is increased by the cost incurred. Consequently, the user also modifies the
      life cycle by updating the revised-original-life field on the MS115P or MS116P screens.
      10.2.9.3. For contributed assets, depreciate applicable improvements separately from the
      original asset.
   10.2.10. To capitalize the asset, enter the ‘operational date’ on DIFMS Update Screens
   MS115P or MS116P. After establishing the operational date, use DIFMS Update Screen
   MS114P to close the F-JON by changing the status code to ‘3’. The F-JON must be closed
   and the PAR must contain an operational date to establish the CIP item as a depreciable item
   within DIFMS. DIFMS automatically moves the asset from CIP to in-use. Should a user
   attempt to delete records, which have yet to achieve Installed Status (Install-Code ‘N’) and
   where procurement job order number retains a cost, an error message will be displayed.
      10.2.10.1. For verification of updates, use DIFMS Report 7310-508 “Fixed Assets
      Update”. This report lists all updates in the current cycle to the Plant Account Records
      made using the Fixed Asset Plant Account Record update screens (MS115P, MS116P,
      MS118P and MS119P), and the resulting Journal Voucher entry (JV type 'FC'). The

       “Assets under Development” and the PAR is on DIFMS Report 7310-501 “Fixed
       Assets”.
       10.2.10.2. Monthly depreciation expense starts at month-end following operational date.
       The assets depreciation expense begins appearing on DIFMS Report 7310-514 “Monthly
       Depreciation”.
   10.2.11. For changes to PAN on the PAR, use DIFMS Update Screens MS118P “FA Land,
   Buildings, Software Plan Account Number” and MS119P “FA Manage Facilities Plant
   Account Number”. Once data is transacted, the old PAN is displayed in the old-PAN field
   on inquiry and update screens associated with these assets.
   10.2.12. When an asset is ready for disposal, the non-operational date is recorded on DIFMS
   Update Screens MS115P or MS116P. This essentially moves an asset from one general
   ledger account to another. The item is not taken off the DIFMS books until it is actually
   shipped out the door. To turn in “Formerly Purchased Equipment, Software, etc” with
   ACCOUNT CODEs beginning with ‘1’,’4’,or ‘6’, use DIFMS Update Screens MS115P or
   MS116P utilizing ACTION CODE ‘D’. This records the loss, if any, to the USSGL account
   721000, Losses on Disposition of Assets. To turn in Contributed Fixed Assets with
   ACCOUNT CODE beginning with ‘2’, select DIFMS Update Screens MS115P or MS116P
   with ACTION CODE ‘C’; TRANS-OUT-IND ‘OD’ and 1690-FLAG ‘Y’, DISP-DATE
   ‘YYMMDD’ (date of disposal). This records the remaining book value to the USSGL
   account 573000D.
   10.2.13. Use the following source documents to support input and modification data within
   DIFMS Fixed Asset module:
       10.2.13.1. Contract (e.g., DD Form 1155)
       10.2.13.2. Depot Maintenance Inter-service Support Agreement (DMISA)
       10.2.13.3. Support Agreement

      10.2.13.12. For change, source documents received by equipment monitor include:
      Audit Documents, e-mail, Reorganizations, Stock Number Changes from Supply. For
      process deletes, source documents received by equipment monitor include: Report of
      Survey, DD Form1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document, and showing turn in. An
      AF IMT 601, Equipment Action Request; DD1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping
      Document; or AF IMT 2005, Issue/Turn-In Request; results in production of DD1348-1A
      from ILS-S. Equipment deletion may occur for a number of reasons such as replacement
      of non-serviceable items and equipment no longer required or missing. Loss generated
      from such disposal will record as overhead expense within DIFMS that ultimately
      influences overhead rates.
      10.2.13.13. Retain documentation for the life of the asset and then per the data retention
      rules identified in DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter 6.
   10.2.14. Fixed Asset JON(s) (MS114P) are to be closed when the asset reaches full
   operational capability (FOC), and the Plant Account Record (PAR) (MS115P / MS116P) is
   established and all data elements are entered including the FOC date. All costs on the JON
   must be captured before the JON is closed and the weekly reports are run. The costs are
   transferred to the PAR for the monthly depreciation to start.
10.3. Depreciation
   10.3.1. The period used for depreciation must follow the provisions of the DoD FMR
   7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter 6.

*Recovery period of less than 5 years is permitted when the acquiring DoD Component is
certain that the useful life of an asset is at least 2 years but less than 5 years. In such
circumstances, the recovery period shall be the known useful life (2-4 years, as appropriate).

**Depending on the nature of the software, it may be depreciated over a period of less than 5
years, 5 years or 10 years. The determining factor should be the actual estimated useful life of
the software consistent with that used for planning the software’s acquisition.
   10.3.2. Financial records for assets capitalized in a Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF)
   activity must: be supported by formal depreciation schedules, have all depreciation expenses
   recorded, and include depreciation expenses in rates charged, except for depreciation of
   facilities acquired through military construction appropriations or other exclusions covered in
   the DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter 6.
   10.3.3. Each AFSC Cost Accounting Office assures depreciation for capital assets is set up
   properly within DIFMS. The AFSC FZR/FM and Maintenance organizations assure
   depreciation for capital assets is expensed properly based on policy in this document as well
   as the DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter 6.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                      215


   10.3.4. DIFMS is the system of record for depreciation of capital assets. DIFMS calculates
   and accumulates monthly depreciation using the straight-line method. DIFMS Report 7310-
   514 “Monthly Depreciation” is run monthly and the report shows the depreciation by asset.
   This report is used monthly to record the depreciation to the appropriate expense accounts
   and the GLAC’s accumulated depreciation account. For accounting entries, see the DIFMS
   7310-514 “Automated Journal Voucher” at the end of the report. The JV format is
   FDMMNN, (with MM representing the month, and NN representing the number of the JV).
   10.3.5. The shop that incurs the depreciation is the custody shop for the asset. The following
   table includes the expense JONs where depreciation is charged based on type of asset.

Note: For Management Initiatives, the JON is based on the type of initiative.
10.4. Transfers In and Out
   10.4.1. Transfers in and out include capital assets that are contributed to the ALC by non-
   organic depot maintenance entity, depot-to-depot transfers, and major development efforts
   capitalized at one ALC and later transferred to all ALCs. This includes items transferred to
   depots through workload realignment or base closures.
   10.4.2. Assets can be physically transferred into or out of the ALC. Both transactions are
   recorded by AFSC Cost Accounting via DIFMS Update Screens MS115P or MS116P. To
   verify transfer actions use DIFMS Report 7310-508 “Fixed Assets Update”. For accounting
   entries, see the DIFMS 7310-514 “Automated Journal Voucher” at the end of the report.
       10.4.2.1. To “transfer in” an asset, establish a PAR and use the original cost and any
       accumulated depreciation incurred. For transfer in of “Contributed Fixed Assets” there
       are two transfer-in options: Transfer in Indicator (TRANS-IN-IND) ‘IA’ - is not replaced
       with WCF CIP monies and ‘IB’ - is replaced with WCF CIP monies.
       10.4.2.2. To “transfer out” an asset, inquire on the PAN using action code “C”; the
       Transfer Out Indicator (TRANS-OUT-IND) is set to ‘OA’ if to another government
       agency or ‘OC’ or ‘OD’ (OC represents transfer out to others without reimbursement
       (DWCF). OD represents transfers out to others without reimbursement (Capital DWCF).
       Set the 1690 flag to ‘Y’, and set a disposal date equal to the current or future date. This
       stops the depreciation and post the transfer out.
       10.4.2.3. A sponsor owned asset is an asset that has been acquired by the ALC without
       the use of depot maintenance WCF. Use DIFMS Update Screens MS115P or MS116P to
       record assets owned by customers and/or parent commands (e.g., Sponsor Owned
       Assets). A Sponsor Owned Asset does not have an F-JON and the asset can be entered
       directly into the DIFMS Update Screens MS115P or MS116P (follow above procedures),
 216                                                             AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


       without tying an F-JON to the plant account number. These items are not owned by
       CSAG but used on site. A first digit of “8 or 9” denotes sponsor owned, in use, or not in
       use. The sponsor owned items are depreciated as funded costs within the DIFMS
       depreciation cycle.
   10.4.3. Capitalizing Major Development Costs at the ALCs. The major development items
   are normally directed by AFMC to be managed at one site until operational and then the costs
   for the project are shared among the ALCs. The managing ALC records the costs in CIP
   under one F-JON until the asset is operational.
       10.4.3.1. When the asset becomes operational, the managing Cost Accountant establishes
       a new JON on the MS114P and PAR (MS115P / MS116P) for each ALC. The total costs
       will be allocated and the costs will be transferred (MS144P) to each ALC’s JON; this
       allocation is based on HQ AFMC direction for full operational capability (FOC) date and
       directions to how costs are to be shared. Each ALC’s JON is closed after reports have
       been run and costs transferred to each ALC’s PAR. The PAR of the other ALCs is
       transferred out (using the MS115P / MS116P) prior to month end to avoid the monthly
       depreciation process. See DIFMS 7310-508 report for information.
       10.4.3.2. The other ALCs receive from the managing ALC documentation to ‘transfer in’
       their share of the major development project. (See paragraph 10.4.2.1. and the DIFMS
       Report 7310-508 “Fixed Assets Update” to verify transfer actions.)
10.5. Fixed Assets Balancing and Reconciliation
   10.5.1. Each AFSC FZR Office implements balancing procedures to validate that all
   additions, changes, and deletions to fixed assets records have been accounted for and that
   they have been accurately recorded in the general ledger. This ensures that correct postings
   have been made to all ledger accounts relating to the fixed assets subsystem and the general
   ledger accurately represents the financial position of each fixed assets record.
   10.5.2. Use the following reports for research and reconciliation.
       10.5.2.1. DIFMS Report 7310-501 “Fixed Assets” is the supporting detail for the Fixed
       Assets USSGL accounts 170000, Fixed Assets, and 910000, Fixed Assets Book Value.
       This report reflects all of the activities installed assets. It shows the book value of all
       fixed assets placed in service by Account Code. It is used to verify DIFMS Report 7310-
       514 “Monthly Depreciation”. It also reflects assets not in use under the section Fixed
       Assets – Not in Use, and reflects Assets Awaiting Transfer in a separate section.
       10.5.2.2. DIFMS Report 7310-506 “Manage Facilities Additions, Changes, Deletions”
       reflects all information gained through the “Manage Facilities” interface during the
       current cycle which passed validation, and all suspense records deleted or corrected
       during the current cycle through DIFMS Update Screen MS117P “Suspense Correction
       Par”. This report is produced weekly and includes the JV entry (type 'FM') resulting
       from these updates to the PAR. This screen and the DIFMS Program MS216P “Plant
       Property Bridge File Data” do not allow the user to perform a “Delete” and “Change”
       transaction simultaneously on the same record. This is because the “undelete”
       transaction is able to reverse the effects of the “delete” transaction but had no way to
       reverse the effect of the “change” transaction.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                 217


     10.5.2.3. DIFMS Report 7310-508 “Fixed Assets Update” lists all updates in the current
     cycle to the Plant Account Records made using the Fixed Asset Plant Account Record
     update screens (MS115P, MS116P and MS118P), and the resulting JV entry (type 'FC').
     10.5.2.4. DIFMS Report 7310-511 “USSGL accounts 1590/1600” reflects all costs
     transferred during the current cycle from USSGL account 1590, Assets under
     Development, to USSGL account 1600, Fixed Assets, and the related JV entry (type
     'FA').
     10.5.2.5. DIFMS Report 7310-712 “Fixed Assets-Assets under Development” lists the
     supporting detail for the USSGL accounts in the 172000-series, Construction in Progress.
     If the asset has not yet been assigned a plant account number, the job order is listed
     without the corresponding plant account number. If a job has been reopened, the residual
     value between the cost on the job number and the cost resident on the plant account
     record is reflected.
     10.5.2.6. DIFMS Report 7310-915 “General Ledger Details Year to Date” provides a
     mechanized general ledger for research and reconciliation with subsidiary ledgers.
  10.5.3. Compare the ledger account balances for fixed assets in DIFMS Report 7310-501,
  Fixed Assets, to the 7310-915.
  10.5.4. Compare the ledger account balances for fixed assets in the current DIFMS Report
  7310-501 to the total of the prior 7310-501 report and the DIFMS Reports 7310-506 7310-
  511, and 7310-514.
  10.5.5. Compare the ledger account balances for assets under development in DIFMS Report
  7310-512 to DIFMS Report 7310-915.
  10.5.6. Compare the ledger account balances for assets under development in the current
  DIFMS Report 7310-512 to the total of the prior 7310-512 report and DIFMS Reports 7310-
  506, 7310-508, 7310-510, and 7310-511.
  10.5.7. Additional reconciliation guidance can be found within the “Financial Reporting
  Guidelines for Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) Real Property”, Version 3, dated
  February 2009.

                     ANALYZE/RECONCILE/REPORT-REPORTING

11.1. Introduction
   11.1.1. Designated personnel (i.e., cost accounting, analysis branch, and budget) review
   reports to assure values recorded are reasonable as compared to targets. Actual costs can be
   compared to targets at various levels of detail, general ledger, division, shop, Job Order
   Number (JON), etc. When significant variances with targets are discovered, research must
   identify the transactions causing the differences so their accuracy and appropriateness can be
   determined and corrective action taken, if necessary. Frequent analysis is important to
   enhance data quality and to understand trends.

       11.1.2.4. Interface Control Documents (ICDs) are documented within the Corporate Data
       Repository System (CDRS) (https://cdrs-pro.wpafb.af.mil/) which reflect where
       DIFMS data is interfaced.
11.2. Performance Measurement
   11.2.1. Variance analysis between actual and established budgets including costs and hours
   is mandatory on a monthly and yearly basis. Analysis can be performed to ensure that the
   data reported through system products, published reports, and other related documents are
   accurate and complete in regards to financial position of the depot maintenance organization.
   The ALC budget personnel and the AFSC FZR may obtain and analyze data from the various
   DIFMS screens, DIFMS On-Line Report Viewer (OLRV) on-line reports, DMAPS Data
   Store (DDS) tables, H033/Cost, Production and Budget Module (CPBM) - Cost and
   Production Performance Module (CPPM) as well as the Budget Target Module (BTM), and
   other system products in performing the analysis at various levels. The analysis should
   include specific causes, remedies, and detail management actions to address concerns.
   11.2.2. To obtain financial performance information, use DIFMS Program MS495P
   “Produce Income Statement” and associated DIFMS Report 7310-977 “Income Statement”.
   This report provides the capability for the user to see views of their financial position
   throughout the reporting month.
       11.2.2.1. DIFMS Report 7310-977, DIFMS Report 7310-935 “DIFMS General Ledger
       Trial Balance”, and the DD Comp AR 1307, Report of Operations, provide both a
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                    219


     monthly and a cumulative (year-to-date) status of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses,
     and operating results for depot maintenance. The DD Comp AF 1307 is designed as a
     consolidated statement which reflects the merger of all trial balances from each ALC and
     AMARG. These monthly reports are provided to evaluate the overall financial status of
     depot maintenance operations.
         11.2.2.1.1. These reports can be analyzed and interpreted in terms of how the ALC
         operations are progressing from a financial point of view, and presented in a manner
         useful to management in identifying problems, making decisions, and controlling
         operations. Revenue is reported by Repair Group Category (RGC). Expenses are
         reported by type of expense. Operating results reflect either a profit realized or loss
         sustained from matching the cost of goods sold to the respective revenues.
     11.2.2.2. Another way to measure performance is to compare the current trial balance
     with the previous month's trial balance in DIFMS Report 7310-935 “General Ledger
     Trial Balance” to determine changes in the accounts. Any unusual changes in asset or
     liability account balances are analyzed by AFSC cost accounting and ALC budget offices
     with assistance of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) to determine the
     impact on the depot maintenance financial status and to identify potential problem areas.
     Special attention should be given to unusual changes in such accounts as Work in Process
     (WIP), material inventories, unallocated costs, and budgetary balances. This report can
     be used to determine if there are any out-of-balances in the trial balance. Information on
     transactions that resulted in the current balances can be found in the DIFMS Journal
     Vouchers (JV) (reference Chapter 9). These vouchers may identify sources that can be
     examined to determine causes.
  11.2.3. Compare actual revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating results to planned
  amounts from DIFMS Update Screen MS753P “General Ledger Budget Tracking” to
  determine variances. This information is also shown on MS083P, “General Ledger Budget
  Tracking Inquiry”. Any significant variance from the operating plan requires a more detailed
  analysis. The cause of the variance is determined, and then actions are recommended in
  order to attain objectives or to adjust the operating plan. This information is indicative of
  local management effectiveness in accomplishing planned workloads and achieving assigned
  goals and overall command progress in realizing the goals of organic depot maintenance as
  set by Headquarters AFMC Financial Management Directorate (AFMC/FM). Analysis
  results obtained from this report is provided to Headquarters AFMC management.
     11.2.3.1. Labor, material, and business operations costs should be considered against
     budgeted values. These budgeted values can be found in H033/CPBM by Resource
     Control Center (RCC) by Month. Research on the detailed transactions, which make up
     those values, may be required. Research can be done by category (labor, material, etc.),
     RCC, timeframe, etc.
     11.2.3.2. DIFMS Report 7310-965 “Automated Balancing” shows any imbalance
     between the trial balance and the subsidiary balance. The trial balance is used to display
     the operating results. Use the 7310-965, produced after a full Cost Summary and the
     General Ledger update, for research and correction of any variances between the trial
     balance and subsidiary balances.
 220                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


       11.2.3.3. DIFMS Report 7310-915 “General Ledger Details Year-to-Date” shows
       posting history of all United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) accounts.
       11.2.3.4. DIFMS Report 7310-715 “Direct Costs by Program and Fund Source” lists
       direct hours and costs for each program and fund source. This report agrees with costs on
       DIFMS Reports 7310-710 “Direct Costs by Job Number Quarter to Date” and 7310-720
       “Direct Cost by Cost Center Quarter-to-Date”. Use this report to support preparation of
       the production performance reports and annual budget.
       11.2.3.5. If there are variances in the labor area, the leave and fringe benefit accounts can
       be reviewed to see if the acceleration factors are correctly defined. USSGL accounts in
       the 2210 series show the accrued values for leave and fringe benefits. USSGL account
       221042Ax-series shows the values used for leave, and 221042Cx-series show the value
       used for benefits. If these values are significantly different from the norm, determine if
       acceleration rate adjustments are needed.
   11.2.4. DFAS assists the AFSC cost accounting office to produce the status on the budgetary
   and proprietary accounts. The AFSC/FM Director and DFAS share responsibility for the
   accuracy of the financial data while the AFSC/FM Director is responsible for the accuracy
   and completeness of the analysis.
       11.2.4.1. The financial trial balance is due to AFMC/FM and DFAS-CO by the fifth
       business day of each month. DFAS prepares supplementary data section of the report
       analysis for AFMC/FM to include accounts receivable by customer, aging of unsupported
       accounts receivable, accounts receivable written off during the Fiscal Year (FY), and
       payments from customers. The AFSC Cost Accounting and DFAS jointly produce the
       financial footnotes and budget analysis sheets that explain the status based on criteria
       directed by AFMC/FM. The analysis portion, which will match the DD Comp AR 1307,
       Report of Operations report, is due to AFMC/FM on the 10th workday of each month.
11.3. Controlling Over/Under Applied Overhead Costs
   11.3.1. Over/under applied overhead variances result from differences between applied costs
   and actual overhead costs. Overhead costs are applied to Direct Production Actual Hours
   (DPAH) hours posted in DIFMS based on established RCC overhead rates for both
   production and general overhead costs. Actual overhead costs are based upon overhead costs
   incurred or distributed by DIFMS transfer processes. DIFMS Report 7310-729 “Actual
   Versus Applied Overhead Year-To-Date (YTD)” shows YTD values for applied, actual
   costs, and over/under applied variances by RCC and by ALC total.
       11.3.1.1. The creation of an H033/CPBM-BTM Overhead Application Rate (OAR)
       Model provides an on-line “Maintain OAR” report by RCC that displays Production
       Overhead (POH) and General and Administrative (G&A) YTD values for Annual Target,
       Actual Costs, Actual Rate, Actual Applied Costs, Current Month Projected Applied
       Costs, and a variance between YTD Actual Costs and Actual Applied Costs by RCC.
       The report also includes Annual Target, YTD Actual, and Current Month Projected
       Direct Production Actual Hours (DPAHs) by RCC.
       11.3.1.2. New POH and G&A Recommended Rates are provided for analysis and
       determination as to whether a modified H033 OAR interface should be sent to DIFMS.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                      221


     OARs are usually reviewed on a monthly basis, but the OARs are only adjusted quarterly,
     or twice a year, at ALC discretion.
     11.3.1.3. After month-end processing, all overhead costs are transferred to production
     RCCs. However, some costs might not transfer, and these costs can be found on the
     DIFMS Report 7310-729 “DIFMS Actual Versus Applied Overhead YTD”. Each cost
     not transferred will be researched and corrected. Some of the problems that have been
     identified are:
         11.3.1.3.1. Transfer percentages at the indirect shop level as shown on DIFMS
         Screen MS174P “Transfer Percentage Update” or on DIFMS Report 7310-260
         “DIFMS Transfer Percentage Update Report” do not equal 100%.
         11.3.1.3.2. Indirect JON does not have a JON Transfer indicator 3 (using the
         Transfer Percentages from the H033 OAR file), which can be seen on DIFMS Screen
         MS056P “Indirect Job Order Inquiry”.
         11.3.1.3.3. A mismatch of indirect JONs starting with an X (Production Overhead
         JON) going to a G&A Shop, or an indirect JON starting with a Y (General and
         Administrative JON) going to an overhead shop. The user can determine what type
         of indirect shop it is by going to the DIFMS Screen MS051P “Cost Center Table
         Inquiry”, and the value in the type column shows that P = Prod OH Shop and G =
         G&A Shop.
         11.3.1.3.4. Indirect material is not being transferred. Indirect material against the
         ‘MDPXX’ shop (for example) does not transfer because shop is G&A and the indirect
         JONs start with an ‘X’ (Production Overhead JON). The assignment of the JON is
         within the AF Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S) and NAVAIR Industrial
         Material Management System (NIMMS) interface.
         11.3.1.3.5. When the user fixes a problem like 100% transfer from DIFMS Report
         7310-260 “DIFMS Transfer Percentage Update Report” and a mismatch of the
         indirect JON and indirect shop (overhead versus G&A), only the current month costs
         transfer. Since prior months costs do not transfer, a request for an SQL must be
         submitted to the Cost Accountant for approval and then processed by the DIFMS
         supplier.
  11.3.2. There can be valid reasons why the applied versus actual costs may reflect a variance
  at a given time. Accrual accounting is done for other costs, but not for labor or material that
  may create “spikes” during certain periods.
     11.3.2.1. Management decisions can impact costs – write-off transactions often impact
     overhead costs.
     11.3.2.2. Workload can be slower than anticipated; thus, hours are short at this time.
     11.3.2.3. Delayed actions can place costs in current rather than prior FY costs.
     11.3.2.4. Unallocated costs in either labor or material can have impact. USSGL accounts
     199000A, Other Assets - Unallocated Labor Expenditures, and 199000B, Other Assets -
     Unallocated Material Expenditures, show these values.
222                                                             AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      11.3.2.5. Suspended transactions (such as Material In Transit (MIT) or unmatched
      material bills) and missing data (such as data held in the DFAS-IE, unaccounted-for time,
      delays in process obligations, etc.) can have impact.
      11.3.2.6. Confirm there were no schedule “run” problems involving a certain file or
      process.
  11.3.3. After excluding the above explanations for variances, use the following tools with
  the DIFMS Report 7310-729 “DIFMS Actual Versus Applied Overhead YTD”: to determine
  if overhead application rate (OAR) changes are necessary.
      11.3.3.1. DIFMS Report 7310-731 “Indirect Cost Summary Year- To-Date” shows the
      YTD overhead costs by RCC and category - labor, material, contractual, other,
      depreciation and unfunded civilian fringe benefit. These values are shown both before
      and after transfers. The transfers are shown in detail on DIFMS Reports 7310-705
      “DIFMS Cost Transfer Transactions” and 7310-706 “DIFMS Percentage Cost Transfer
      Transactions”. These totals are for both funded and unfunded costs and for POH and
      G&A costs. These values can help explain why the overhead costs are or are not in line
      with anticipated overhead costs YTD.
      11.3.3.2. DIFMS Report 7310-785 “Indirect Cost Summary Year-To-Date Object Class”
      shows funded overhead costs by RCC, USSGL account, object class, and categories of
      costs. DIFMS Report 7310-783 “Direct Costs by Cost Center YTD Object Class” shows
      direct costs by RCC, USSGL account, object class, and categories of costs. Both reports
      list the hours by type – regular, overtime, and civilian and military. This data is helpful
      in evaluating budgeted direct hours versus actual direct hours YTD. These reports also
      show material, contractual and business operations costs by RCC, but not by JON.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                   223




Table 11.1. Material and Business Operations (Other) Costs
Material             Material costs, including inventory types W (receipted to the MIC
                     instead of the line) and E reported from NIMMS. Note: COC entries
                     from Business Operations (Other) Costs, if coded to Object Class W or
                     E show in Business Operations (Other) Cost in some reports. USSGL
                     account 610000W2 shows the material costs. Object Class functionality
                     is built into the DIFMS processes for the 7310-783 and 7310-785
                     reports.
Contractual          Expenses recorded through Business Operations (Other) Cost process
                     with COC equal 1 - 50 excluding 45.
Contractual          Accrual adjustment for the annual military assessment recorded in
Military             Business Operations (Other) Cost as a Posting Code record with COC =
                     45. This accrual maintains a cost balance equal to the cost appropriate
                     to YTD time period and military costs recorded YTD for hours worked
                     by military.
Other                Expenses recorded through Business Operations (Other) Cost process
                     with COC equal 51 - 99 but not 54, 59 or 60.
Direct               Transactions that contain COCs outside range of 01-99, (i.e. alpha not
Transportation       used by AF)
Unfunded             This is no longer recorded by the Air Force due to the “Financial
Depreciation         Reporting Guidelines for Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF)
                     Real Property”, Version 3, dated February 2009.
Funded               Depreciation expenses recorded from monthly depreciation cycle based
Depreciation         on RCC and Account. Code assigned to asset, which is not ‘unfunded’.
Funded Costs         The sum of the funded costs shown for that RCC or total on the report.
        11.3.3.3. DIFMS Report 7310-735 “Open Direct Job Status” shows cost by open JON.
        Report 7310-745 “Closed Direct Job Status” shows costs by closed JON. Use DIFMS
        Report 7310-732 “Indirect Costs by Shop within JON Year-To-Date” to research indirect
        costs. This report lists all Year-to-Date indirect costs by Job Number and Shop.
11.4. End-of-Period Processing
   11.4.1. Use guidance in the DIFMS users’ manual for monthly, quarterly, and year-end
   procedures. Also annual direction published by AFMC Financial Management Directorate
   (AFMC/FM) and DFAS Columbus Center (DFAS-CO) for any specific processing
   procedures.
   11.4.2. Part of end-of-period processing is to assure an adequate audit trail and sufficient
   archiving of information. Use the following reports for audit trail. Run the DIFMS purge
   processes, which produce these reports, on an as-needed basis.
        11.4.2.1. Labor does not have a separate purge process, and instead labor is
        automatically updated each payroll cycle. Refer to DIFMS Report 7310-565 “DIFMS
        Labor Distribution Summary by Expense Account” to balance the labor distribution
        process. This report provides the labor expenditures from the regular labor process by
        expense account. The report provides a subtotal for direct, production, general, and
224                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      service center cost for civilian and military employees. The report also has a leave
      section which summarizes the hours and cost to each leave type. Finally, the report
      displays the journal voucher (JV Type 'LD') and the overhead rates used to apply funded
      and unfunded overhead cost.
      11.4.2.2. DIFMS Report 7310-C01 “Plant Account Record Purge” reports all Plant
      Account Records (PAR) purged from the DIFMS database. These records have been
      flagged for deletion in excess of 90 days.
      11.4.2.3. DIFMS Report 7310-C02 “Non-Billing Purged Customer” lists all customer
      orders for fixed assets and manufacturing for the depot, which have been purged from the
      DIFMS database. These customers order records have been flagged for deletion in
      excess of 90 days.
      11.4.2.4. DIFMS Report 7310-C03 “Non-Billing Purged Job Orders” lists all job order
      numbers for fixed assets customer orders purged from the DIFMS database.
      11.4.2.5. DIFMS Report 7310-C04 “Non-Billing Purged Customer Order Transaction
      History” lists the transaction history for all fixed assets and manufacturing for depot
      customer orders, which have been purged from the DIFMS database.
      11.4.2.6. DIFMS Report 7310-C05 “Purged Customer Orders” provides the user with an
      audit trail of sponsor records purged from the database in DIFMS Program MS251P
      “Annual Sponsor Purges”. Part II provides the user with an audit trail of customer order
      records purged from the database in DIFMS Program MS251P.
      11.4.2.7. DIFMS Report 7310-C10 “Purged Customer Order Transaction History”
      provides a hardcopy of all Sponsor Records processed in DIFMS Program MS251P and
      moved to a history file for an audit trail.
      11.4.2.8. DIFMS Report 7310-C15 “Purged Job Orders” provides an audit trail of
      updates to the job order records processed in DIFMS Program MS254P “Annual Indirect
      Purges”. PART I reflects the direct job order records; PART II reflects the Indirect Job
      Order Records. DIFMS Program MS254P deletes all Indirect Job Order Records when
      the job order has been closed for a minimum of 90 days, and automatically deletes
      transfer percentage records whenever the transfer percentages have been uniquely
      established at the individual Job Order Number (JON) level. This relieves the user of the
      responsibility to delete these records manually using the DIFMS Screen MS174P
      “Transfer Percentage Update”. This also eliminates the problems encountered when the
      users attempted to delete the data after the indirect job number had already been purged.
      11.4.2.9. DIFMS Report 7310-C20 “Purged Asset/Liability File” provides a hardcopy of
      the balances of the asset liability records processed in DIFMS Program MS252P “Annual
      Other Purges”.
      11.4.2.10. DIFMS Report 7310-C25 “Purged Billing History” lists the billing history file
      by job order number or customer order number processed in DIFMS Program MS251P.
      11.4.2.11. DIFMS Report 7310-C30 “Material Requisition Status Purge” lists all
      completed Material Requisition Records being moved to the Material Requisition Status
      History File processed in DIFMS Program MS255P, “Monthly Material Due Purges”.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                 225


      11.4.2.12. DIFMS Report 7310-C50 “Material Requisition Status History Purge” lists all
      purged Material Requisition Records that have been deleted from the Material
      Requisition Status History File processed in MS253P “Annual Other Purges”.
11.5. Depot Maintenance Reporting
   11.5.1. The Keystone Decision Support System (KDSS-H303) Depot Maintenance Cost
   (DMC) folder provides the collection, summarization, and reporting for both organic and
   contract depot maintenance costs, in accordance with the DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 6A,
   Chapter 14. For the three Air Logistic Commands (ALCs: Hill, Tinker, and Robins) organic
   data is from DIFMS through DDS. Data is reported through other systems for the Aerospace
   Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) and contract depot maintenance.
   11.5.2. Interface Information:
      11.5.2.1. DDS interface provides ALC organic cost and production data by transaction to
      KDSS-H303 monthly. H303 users identify the Weapon System Support Code (WSSC)
      from the DDS applicable weapon system information.
      11.5.2.2. The AMARG Business System (ABS) interface provides AMARG organic cost
      and production data by JON transactions to KDSS-H303 monthly.
      11.5.2.3. The Commercial Asset Visibility – Air Force (CAVAF) System provides
      monthly cost data for contract depot maintenance.
      11.5.2.4. Contract and Government Entity (CAGE) Code. Monthly updates are received
      from the Federal Logistics Data System (FEDLOG) to validate CAGE codes are current
      for contracted work.
      11.5.2.5. End Item Identification Number (EIIN) Code. The Master Item Identification
      Control System (MIICS/D043) is used to provide EIIN data elements monthly.
      11.5.2.6. No systems provide the Weapon or Support system Code (WSSC) or the Work
      Breakdown Structure (WBS) codes directly. For each JON and Contract/CLIN, these
      data elements are initially input directly into KDSS-H303. KDSS users often use DIFMS
      data screens to determine organic information. Since CAVAF does not provide the
      CAGE code, KDSS users must initially input the CAGE, which is validated as current by
      the KDSS system.
      11.5.2.7. Weapon System Cost Retrieval System (WSCRS), contained in the Air Force
      Total Cost Data (AFTOC) Data Warehouse, collects operating and support costs of
      weapon systems and provides repair and condemnation costs for those weapon systems
      and their components to satisfy user requirements. This information is sent yearly by
      FTP from KDSS to AFTOC.
   11.5.3. Depot Maintenance Cost System (DMCS) AP-MP (A) 1397 Annual Process:
      11.5.3.1. The annual DMCS data submissions shall be provided to the Deputy Assistant
      Secretary of Defense for Maintenance Policy and Programs (DASD (MP&P), Office of
      the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology & Logistics) or its designated
      agent no later than 31 December following the end of the fiscal year. Each data
      submission shall be accompanied by a transmittal memorandum that includes a brief
 226                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


       discussion of any anomalies in the data and significant changes from the previous
       submissions, or other pertinent information to aid in processing the data.
       11.5.3.2. Within 90 days of the initial data submission, a brief narrative analysis
       explaining trends in the data is submitted. The focus of the narrative analysis shall be on
       factors driving year-to-year changes in cost and direct labor hours. Reporting
       requirement symbol AP-MP (A) 1397 is assigned to the annual Deport Maintenance
       submissions to DASD (MP&P).
       11.5.3.3. The DASD (MP&P) or its designated agent prepares and publishes summary
       tables and the “DoD Depot Data Highlights Report”. The DASD (MP&P) maintains
       lookup tables of pertinent data elements and codes for use by the Military Departments
       by compiling the data from all DoD Components (Air Force, Army, Navy, etc.).
11.6. Use of DIFMS Reporting Tools
   11.6.1. DIFMS and Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Industrial Material
   Management System (NIMMS) standard reports can be accessed through On-Line Report
   Viewing (OLRV), FTP, and DEPCON. On-line queries can be used to access data within the
   database with appropriate access through the site Report Working Group.
   11.6.2. Refer to the DIFMS Users’ Manual for a complete description of all DIFMS reports.
   The most current information can be obtained from the Technical Service Organization’s
   website: https://t6800.csd.disa.mil/DifmsPortal/index.php.
11.7. DDS Reports
   11.7.1. DDS also supports management information and analysis functions with a variety of
   reports. Each ALC also provides site unique custom reporting using the DDS, DDSRI
   (Reporting Instance), and their own local data repository as data sources using the
   IBM/Cognos Business Intelligence Reporting tool. Primary focus of data is to provide a
   historical repository at the task and transaction level currently not supported by DIFMS for
   the period specified by the AF. For example, DDS also has the ability to capture associated
   transactions at the task level from the originating JON to the consuming JON for all tasks
   against an Inventory Tracking Number (ITN) ‘1’, where ITN ‘1’ and ITN ‘2’ has not been
   completed and actual hours have accumulated when the originating JON was financially
   closed. Standard Corporate Reporting is limited to information available from the
   DDS/DDSRI databases at the ALC where the users are located. Users have the option of
   saving any report to their personal desktop system. The IBM/Cognos Business Intelligence
   Reporting tool provides users the capability to save the file in Comma Separated Value
   (CSV) format for use with Excel or as a text file to use in a Word document. There are no
   restrictions regarding file-naming conventions when the user is prompted for a file name.
       11.7.1.1. The IBM/Cognos Business Intelligence Reporting tool provides the ability for
       users to view published reports executed against the data stored in the DDS/DDSRI and
       local data repository databases. The reports are developed in list, grouped list, summary,
       or cross-tab forms. Reports can be defined for the user to start at a general level so that
       the user may narrow down the selections and ‘drill-down’ to the specific information
       needed. After the report is displayed to the user, the user may print the report, provided a
       local or network printer is connected to the user’s desktop computer. Refer to the
       DMAPS-IE user manual for a listing of Standard reports and options. Contact each
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                      227


      ALCs IBM/Cognos Business Intelligence reporting organization for comprehensive list
      of locally developed site unique reports and capabilities.
      11.7.1.2. H033/CPBM-Cost and Production Performance Module (CPPM) extracts data
      from DDS on a daily and monthly basis. CPPM provides on-line daily and monthly
      standard reports for CSAG comparison of actual results compared with the financial and
      production targets by RCC, Branch, Division, or ALC. Two years of on-line monthly
      data is maintained for all reports; daily reports are purged based on local ALC direction.
      11.7.1.3. Each ALC must appoint a DDS monitor to keep DDS and DIFMS reconciled.
      Differences can cause many variances in a range of reports between DIFMS and DDS.
11.8. External Reporting
   11.8.1. The Air Force is required to report to other organization (such as DoD, OMB, and
   Treasury) on financial results in a wide range of topics. Requirements and instructions for
   this external reporting are covered in the DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR)
   7000.14-R. For depot maintenance, the main external reports are listed in the below exhibit.

   11.8.2. DFAS prepares these reports, in coordination with the ALCs, using information from
   DIFMS and other sources. The reports include information for depot maintenance and other
   activities, such as supply management. The references in DoD FMR 7000.14-R may provide
   specific content and procedures related to these reports.
   11.8.3. A main source for these reports is the DIFMS Report 7310-935 “General Ledger
   Trial Balance”. Under DIFMS processing, DFAS must have the trial balance by the 5th
   workday. DFAS-CO loads the DIFMS trial balance information into the departmental
   system for processing. Trial balances for other activities are also loaded into the
   departmental system. Supplemental information required by departmental, but not contained
   in the Trial Balance is also entered. This supplemental information includes non-financial
   information and footnotes, which DFAS works with the AFSC to obtain. Where necessary,
   the trial balance information is systematically cross-walked to the USSGL. The
   Departmental system uses the cross walked USSGL trial balance information to perform
   various proofs and balancing routines to insure the trial balance is accurate before proceeding
   to the next step in the departmental reporting process. Problems identified in the depot

  maintenance information may be referred to the AFSC for review and resolution. The
  departmental system then assigns the cross-walked USSGL accounts to applicable report
  lines. Then reports are submitted to the required organizations by the required due dates.

                               ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES

12.1. Introduction
   12.1.1. This chapter provides direction and information on subjects not covered elsewhere in
   the financial policies and procedures document.
   12.1.2. References:
      12.1.2.1. Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management and
      Comptroller (SAF/FM) 03-04, Interim Guidance for Miscellaneous Obligation

12.2. Trading Partner Transactions
   12.2.1. Work may be performed between the three CSAG ALC and AMARG. Accounting
   standards do allow recognition of revenue for work between CSAG ALC, therefore the
   revenue transactions must be eliminated in the Air Force consolidated financial statements.
   However, the bases can record and track accounts receivable between each other. Do not
   confuse this terminology with intra-ALC support, which pertains to work between two
   divisions within a ALC, which cannot be reported as revenue. For example, Hill cannot
   recognize revenue for work done at Hill.
   12.2.2. Use the following procedures if the customer funds are cited by the requesting ALC.
   Requesting ALC sends AFMC IMT 181, Project Order, with customer line of accounting.
   When DFAS does the billing, the originating customers’ funds are disbursed. No eliminating
   entries are needed for these transactions.
   12.2.3. Use the following procedures if the ALC funds are cited by the requesting ALC.
   Whenever one ALC does business with another ALC, a Military Interdepartmental Purchase
   Request (MIPR) that has been stamped “per United States Code (U.S.C.) 23” when accepted
   or an AF IMT 185, Project Order, is used and entered as a path 3 in J025A. This process is
   necessary, because of the DFAS-DE document numbering requirements and to establish a
   complete audit trail. All inter-ALC support is billed at fixed price using a Reimbursement
   Code of ‘K’. By following these procedures, the ALC reports all of its revenues, expenses,
   accounts receivable, liabilities, and advances received as if it were operating independently,
   but the financials at Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC)-level show duplicative revenue
   and cost of goods sold.
   12.2.4. The Trading Partner Report sums the detailed revenue, advances, and accounts
   receivable transactions by sales code. The report includes data for each ALC CSAG
   organization as well as the Army, Navy, Marines, other DOD organizations (such as DLA,
   DISA, DFAS) and organizations outside of the DOD (e.g., Homeland Security, State
   Department, and NASA). This report supports elimination entries in the trial balance
   consolidation process done by DFAS Departmental Reporting. Sales codes are established
   and maintained by DFAS. Sales codes are not in DIFMS consequently, when the base

   General Ledger Account creates the Trading Partner Report, the MSA must manually tie the
   sales code to the transaction by way of the transaction’s fund cite. See Chapter 9 for more
   information.
   12.2.5. For analysis of operating results, Headquarters AFMC Financial Management
   Directorate (AFMC/FM) requires visibility of the inter-ALC obligations, Work in Process
   (WIP), revenue and cost of goods sold on a monthly basis. Therefore, include information on
   inter-ALC support in the monthly report narrative.
12.3. System Implications for Reorganization/Realignment
   12.3.1. Reorganizations include changes in mission responsibilities from one organizational
   element to another. Realignments adjust authorized personnel equivalents to accommodate
   workload. To accommodate system changes and budget requirements, it is essential that
   reorganization and realignment processes are coordinated so system information changes are
   updated in the right sequence. Reference specific ALC reorganization procedures if
   pertinent.
   12.3.2. Below are considerations for system and related implications for the Depot
   Maintenance Accounting and Production System (DMAPS).
   12.3.2.1. No financial history is changed because of reorganization.
       12.3.2.2. Resource Control Center (RCC) changes due to reorganization normally
       involve a one-to-one relationship where the functions of the old RCC are moved to the
       new RCC. These changes require data base administration support and coordination with
       all the systems involved. Timing of the changes is an important aspect of management,
       both the frequency of allowed changes during the year and the length of time to complete
       the reorganization.
       12.3.2.3. ALCs developing budgets in CPBM-H033. The requesting organization, in
       coordination with other organizations within the ALC and Maintenance Wing, will build
       a new organization structure/budget in H033 that includes the new RCCs. The budget
       will include Production Overhead and General & Administrative (G&A) Overhead
       Application Rates and transfer percentages. When a supporting budget for the new RCC
       or changes to an existing RCC has been created in BTM, the RCC may now be loaded in
       DIFMS.
       12.3.2.4. Open Doc-Job-Shop records under the old RCC must have a Line of
       Accounting (LOA) change to the new RCC. The Open Document Listing (ODL) must be
       reviewed in both GAFS/BL and DIFMS. The DIFMS ODL can be obtained by using
       DIFMS Report 7310-645 “Asset/Liability Balances” or Cognos query. GAFS/BL
       requires an ODL query. Modifications may need to be submitted for certain contracts
       and MORDs. DIFMS has programs MS632P and MS633P to assist in mass
       reorganizations.     Document can be found at the DFAS I&T Website:
       https://t6800.csd.disa.mil/DifmsPortal
       12.3.2.5. Material records under the old RCC must have a line of accounting (LOA)
       change to a new RCC for open commercial material records in the Naval Air Systems
       Command (NAVAIR) Industrial Material Management System (NIMMS Changes to
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                 231


     RCCs on commercial material records can be posted by using NIMMS Screen MN021P,
     “Material Due Update”.
     12.3.2.6. All Fixed Assets (FA) associated with the old RCC must be changed to the new
     RCC. FA ownership in DIFMS can be determined by using DIFMS Report 7310-501,
     Fixed Assets, or Cognos query. Changes to fixed asset owning RCCs in DIFMS may be
     processed on DIFMS Update Screens MS115P “FA Land, Buildings, Software Plant
     Account Record (PAR)” and MS116P “FA Equipment Other PAR”.
     12.3.2.7. All Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) transfer tables
     having the old RCC as the Benefiting Shop/Cost Center (CC) to Owning RCC must be
     reviewed. DIFMS Screen MS151P, Indirect Job Order, may be used to update the field
     for each PMEL JON.
     12.3.2.8. All Depot Organic Contractor Augmentee Team (DOCAT) transfer tables for
     the old RCC must be deleted. New DOCAT transfer tables for the new RCC must be
     added. Deletions and additions of DOCAT transfer tables are input into DIFMS Update
     Screen MS724P, Transfer Percentage.
     12.3.2.9. All RCCs that have been replaced, or which are no longer valid must be
     marked for deletion using DIFMS Update Screen MS168P “Valid Shop Cost Center”.
     Marking the RCC for deletion prevents any new costs from posting in DIFMS. Compare
     DIFMS valid shops to H033 before deletion. Do not delete PSSDs that are tied to a RCC,
     even if the RCC is being marked for deletion.
     12.3.2.10. NIMMS store record changes may also be required. Identify all of the data
     elements so it can be determined in advance what data can be changed. One option for
     manually transferring material from the old RCC to new RCC is to use NIMMS Screen
     MN013P “Store to Store Material Transfer”. Users also need to update material due
     records through NIMMS Screen MN021P “Material Due Update”. These are very labor-
     intensive processes. NIMMS creates an inventory change to DIFMS using store-to-store
     transfer through use of existing NIMMS Programs MN413P “Batch Transfer” and
     MN421P “Batch JON/Shop Material Due Record Update”.
     12.3.2.11. Reorganizations must be performed in the Time and Attendance System
     (TAA) and must be coordinated with DIFMS POC. New RCCs must be valid in TAA
     before moves can be made. TAA provides the capability to perform mass moves of
     employees from one RCC to another using the Employee Mass Change – Permanent
     RCC screen. This screen updates the “Permanent RCC” in the ‘ta_todd_tbl’ for the
     affected employees. TAA also provides the capability to perform Workload Mass
     Changes, which allows changes by JON to new RCC and new skill. This screen updates
     the selected fields in the ta_wo_opn_tbl. Access to these capabilities is limited to the
     TAA POC at each site.
        12.3.2.12. Depending on the established date of the new RCCs, deletion dates of all
        RCCs during reorganizations also need to be discussed with the DIFMS POC to allow
        time to get any labor processed during the current pay period to be changed to the
        new RCC via the DLCP screens in TAA.
        12.3.2.13. Several DMAPS feeder or other systems also need to be updated for the
        changed organization and/or realignment. The DIFMS Interface File MS204D09,
 232                                                             AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


          Valid Shops, includes a deletion date, which is used by the RCC Skill Code System
          (RSCS) to determine RCCS that need to be deleted from RSCS. The RSCS then
          updates the legacy systems based on that effective date. The RSCS extract software
          can control which systems get the complete list and which get only the active list by
          using the activation date provided by DIFMS. This could limit the amount of manual
          modifications to legacy systems. Also, need to maintain the skill code relationships
          within the RSCS for newly established or modified organizations.
12.4. Mass Change Capability in DIFMS
   12.4.1. DIFMS provides a mass change capability for shop (RCC) information. To
   accomplish this and interface/integrate into other DMAPS and Air Force systems, DIFMS
   has a data element, ‘Effective-Date’, in the Valid-Shops table. This element is updatable
   through the DIFMS Update Screens MS168P “Valid Shop/Cost Center” and MS671P “Batch
   Valid Shop/Cost Center”. The capability exists to pass this date to other systems on file
   DIFMS File MS204D09 “Valid Shops Interface”. Users should be able to execute their own
   mass changes independently of DIFMS data due to Shop reorganizations within the activity.
   This should provide a substantially more mechanized solution for the Air Force sites. Prior
   to this change, users had to execute a series of manual steps and screen input as well as query
   language updates to achieve the desired results. These processes should save time and
   resources at the activity level as well as reduce or eliminate the need for Defense Finance and
   Accounting Service Information and Technology (DFAS I&T) to provide assistance.
   12.4.2. When addition of many shops (RCC) is required, DIFMS has a capability to load
   them via a batch feed were provided with DIFMS Programs MS660P “Batch Cost Center
   Update” and MS496P “Report Batch Cost Center Updates”. Since there is a one-to-one
   relationship between Shop and Cost Center, this provides a valuable labor saving tool when
   major reorganizations occur. In addition, this process is applied within the DIFMS Program
   MS304P “Job/Shop Validation” to prevent premature use of Valid-Shops that are being
   planned for the future. This is the case for all new Valid-Shops established, even if “mass
   changes” are not being planned.
   12.4.3. Internally, DIFMS has a ‘From/To’ DIFMS Shop Conversion Table
   (DIFMS_SHOP_CNV) that allows for a series of From/To Shop changes via multiple
   mechanized batch processes. The table is updateable using the DIFMS Update Screen
   MS702P “Shop Conversion” and can be viewed using the DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS042P
   “Shop Conversion”. Records/data covered by this mass change capability are detailed in the
   descriptions below for each of the “mass change” mechanized batch processes. The user has
   the option of running all of the “mass change” processes or just a portion of them, based on
   their local need.
       12.4.3.1. DIFMS Program MS304P “Job/Shop Validation Procedure” rejects
       transactions where the Transaction-Date is earlier than the Shop Effective Date (on the
       Valid Shops record). This validation applies to any new Valid Shop, regardless of
       whether mass change capabilities are being exercised. In addition, a number of programs
       within the DIFMS Fixed Asset subsystem (reference Chapter 10) reject transactions that
       were earlier than the Shop Effective Date in relation to the “Custody” and “Sub-Custody”
       Shops being entered on the Plant Account record as well as the Valid-Shops Delete-Date.
       These include transactions entered from DIFMS Update Screens MS115P “Fixed Asset
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     233


     Land, Buildings/Software Plant Account Record (PAR)”, MS116P “Fixed Asset
     Equipment/Other PAR”, MS117P “Fixed Asset Suspense Correction PAR” and MS216P
     “Process Plant Property Interface Data”. DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS033P “Valid Shops”
     displays the Effective-Date existing Deletion-Date from the Valid-Shops record.
     12.4.3.2. Use DIFMS Update Screen MS168P “Valid Shops” for updating the Effective-
     Date on the Valid-Shops record. If the field is left blank on an ‘Add’ transaction, it
     defaults to the Current-System date (current calendar day). Cross-validation with the
     Deletion-Date ensures that the Deletion-Date had to be greater than or equal to the
     Effective-Date. DIFMS Program MS671P “Batch Valid Shops Update” processes the
     transactions. DIFMS Report 7310-241 “Valid Shop/Cost Center Update” displays results
     of the DIFMS Program MS671P with the ‘Effective-Date’ is on the in both the “Valid”
     and “Error” sections.
     12.4.3.3. Entries to DIFMS Update Screen MS151P “Indirect Job Number” are validated
     in the ‘Benefiting Shop/Cost Center Transfer’ field to ensure that if the benefiting shop
     was a “Shop” (not a rolled up Cost Center), then the update to that field could not occur
     until the Valid Shop was effective (could not occur earlier than the Effective-Date). In a
     similar manner, if the Shop was in a Delete status (Deletion-Code equal ‘D’), then the
     update would still be allowed if it were being attempted earlier than the Deletion-Date.
     DIFMS Program MS640P “Batch Indirect Job Number Update” processes the
     transactions.
     12.4.3.4. Entries to MS167P (Cost Center Update) are validated to ensure none of the
     Cost Center level “default” Job Order Numbers could already exist as Direct JONs. In
     addition, if any Responsible Shop associated with those JONs had been “deleted”
     (Delete-Code of ‘D’ with prior Deletion-Date, the reference to that “default” Job Number
     would force the Cost Center Update to err. DIFMS Program MS660P “Batch Cost
     Center Update” provides a vehicle for establishing new Cost Centers in a more efficient
     and less labor-intensive manner. Since the establishment of new Cost Centers is often the
     first step in a re-organization, the ability to create a high volume of Cost Centers without
     manual screen input is desirable. This program parallels the business rules and
     functionality resident in the on-line DIFMS Update Screen. This is particularly
     beneficial since there is a one-to-one relationship between Cost Centers and Valid Shops.
     DIFMS Report 7310-712 “Cost Center Updates” displays both valid updates (successful)
     and invalid update attempts (unsuccessful) resulting from DMAPS Program MS660P.
     12.4.3.5. DIFMS Update Screen MS702P “Shop Conversion” provides capability to
     establish a series of ‘From/To’ shop relationships that are used by a series of batch mass
     change processes to alter the shop values on various DIFMS tables. The database record
     used to store the ‘From/To’ relationships and keep a record of which mass change
     processes have been run is the DIFMS Shop Conversion record (DIFMS_SHOP_CNV).
     The program supporting the screen requires that both the ‘From’ and ‘To’ Shop values
     entered must already exist on the DIFMS Valid Shops record, which is updated using the
     on-line DIFMS Update Screen MS168P and the DIFMS Program MS671P. The screen
     also accepts “wild card” ranges of shops (depicted by asterisks) to establish mass change
     relationships for authorized shops. The ranges can contain either full Shop values or a
     mixture of beginning values followed by asterisks. For the “wild card” ranges entered, at
     least one ‘Valid-Shop’ must exist in the range entered. The “wild card” ranges are only
234                                                             AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      entered for the purpose of establishing ‘From/To’ relationships for the mass adds of
      authorized shops via DIFMS Program MS662P “Mass Change for Adding New
      Authorized Shops” and deletes of authorized shops via DIFMS Program MS663P, “Mass
      Change for Deleting Old Authorized Shops”. For any other ‘From/To’ mass change to
      occur, the full Shop values must be entered. Changes to the ‘To’ shop value are not
      allowed until at least one of the Mass Change processes has run (one of the Conversion
      Indicators on the record is a ‘Y’). Only one instance of the ‘From’ shop can exist on the
      table at any point in time. These records are ultimately purged by the DIFMS Program
      MS658P “Shop Conversion Record Purge” when that job is scheduled and the
      appropriate data purging conditions have been met. DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS042P
      “Shop Conversion” displays the shop conversion table data that was established using the
      DIFMS Update Screen MS702P. The screen displays the “From Shop”, “To Shop”,
      Effective-Date and each of the Conversion Indicators that are flagged to a value of ‘Y’ by
      each batch Mass Change process.
      12.4.3.6. DIFMS Program MS627P “Labor Job Shop Error Mass Change” does mass
      changes to Shop fields on the Labor Job Shop Errors record based on the ‘From’ (Old)
      and ‘To’ (New) shop values on the new DIFMS Shop Conversion record and produces
      the DIFMS Report 7310-546 “Labor Job/Shop Error Record Shop Conversion”. The
      report displays for each changed record the Error Serial Number, Job Number, From
      (Old) and To (New) Shops and the Shop-Effective-Date. The report is capable of
      displaying data changed from the Shop, Benefiting Shop and Unallocated Shop fields
      (the Benefiting Shop and Unallocated Shop are not currently being used in DIFMS). The
      program only changes data if the Date-Shop-Effective from the Shop Conversion record
      is less than or equal to the Current System Date. The program also updates the Labor-
      Conversion-Indicator on the Shop Conversion record to signify that this particular mass
      change process has occurred. The purpose of performing mass changes on Labor Job
      Shop Errors is to allow for future corrections made to the “Job Number only” to process
      more cleanly through the system.
      12.4.3.7. DIFMS Program MS632P “Travel Accrual Mass Change” does mass changes
      to shop fields on the Travel Accrual records based on the ‘From’ (Old) and ‘To’ (New)
      shop values on the new DIFMS Shop Conversion record and produces the DIFMS Report
      7310-632 “Travel Record Shop Conversion”. The new report displays for each changed
      record the Document Number, Job Number, From (Old) and To (New) Shops and the
      Shop-Effective-Date. The program only changes data if the Date-Shop-Effective from
      the Shop Conversion record is less than or equal to the Current System Date. It also only
      succeeds if the Fiscal Year of the Current-Process-Date (from the System-Info record) is
      not less than the Fiscal Year of the Date-Effective. This ensures that the process does not
      run too early and change records prior to the end of fiscal year processing. Only Travel
      records not in a ‘3’ (Completed) status are modified. The program also updates the
      Travel-Conversion-Indicator on the Shop Conversion record to signify that this particular
      mass change process has occurred.
      12.4.3.8. DIFMS Program MS633P “Doc-Job-Shop Mass Change” does mass changes to
      shop fields on the Doc-Job-Shop records based on the ‘From’ (Old) and ‘To’ (New) Shop
      values on the new DIFMS Shop Conversion record and produces the DIFMS Report
      7310-633 “Doc-Job-Shop Record Shop Conversion”. The report displays for each
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     235


     changed record the Document Number, Job Number, From (Old) and To (New) Shops
     and the Shop-Effective-Date. The program only changes data if the Date-Shop-Effective
     from the Shop Conversion record is less than or equal to the Current System Date. It also
     only succeeds if the Fiscal Year of the Current-Process-Date (from the System-Info
     record) is not less than the Fiscal Year of the Date-Effective. This ensures that the
     process does not run too early and change records prior to the end of fiscal year
     processing. Only Doc-Job-Shop records not in a ‘3’ (Completed) status are modified.
     The program also updates the Doc-Job-Shop-Conversion-Indicator on the Shop
     Conversion record to signify that this particular mass change process has occurred.
     12.4.3.9. DIFMS Program MS654P “Plant Account Mass Change” does mass changes to
     shop fields on the Doc-Job-Shop records based on the ‘From’ (Old) and ‘To’ (New) Shop
     values on the new DIFMS Shop Conversion record and produces the DIFMS Report
     7310-523 “Doc-Job-Shop Record Shop Conversion”. The report displays for each
     changed record the Plant Account Number, From (Old) and To (New) Custody Shops and
     From (Old) and To (New) Sub-Custody Shops and the Shop-Effective-Date. The
     program only changes data if the Date-Shop-Effective from the Shop Conversion record
     is less than or equal to the Current System Date. It also only succeeds if the Fiscal Year
     of the Current-Process-Date (from the System-Info record) is not less than the Fiscal
     Year of the Date-Effective. This ensures that the process does not run too early and
     change records prior to the end of fiscal year processing. The program also updates the
     Doc-Job-Shop-Conversion-Indicator on the Shop Conversion record to signify that this
     particular mass change process has occurred.
     12.4.3.10. DIFMS Program MS661P “Mass Change for Indirect JON Benefiting Shop”
     does mass changes to the Indirect JON Benefiting Shop field on the Indirect-JON Data
     records based on the ‘From’ (Old) and ‘To’ (New) Shop values on the new DIFMS Shop
     Conversion record and produces the DIFMS Report 7310-110 “Benefiting Shop Cost
     Center Conversion”. The new report displays for each changed record the Job Number,
     From (Old) Benefiting Shop, To (New) Benefiting Shop and the Shop-Effective-Date.
     The program only changes data if the Date-Shop-Effective from the Shop Conversion
     record is less than or equal to the Current System Date. It also only succeeds if the Fiscal
     Year of the Current-Process-Date (from the System-Info record) is not less than the
     Fiscal Year of the Date-Effective. This ensures that the process does not run too early
     and change records prior to the end of fiscal year processing. The program also updates
     the Benefiting Shop Conversion-Indicator on the Shop Conversion record to signify that
     this particular mass change process has occurred.
     12.4.3.11. DIFMS Program MS662P “Mass Change for Adding New Authorized Shops”
     does mass changes to create new Direct and Indirect Authorized Shops (for the ‘To’
     Shop) based on the ‘From’ (Old) and ‘To’ (New) Shop values on the new DIFMS Shop
     Conversion record and produces the DIFMS Report 7310-111 “New Authorized Shop”.
     The report displays for each changed record the Job Number, From (Old) Authorized
     Shop, To (New) Authorized Shop and the Shop-Effective-Date. Unlike some of the other
     programs, this program does no check to ensure the Date-Shop-Effective is less than or
     equal to the Current System Date. This is because the “new” Authorized Shops may need
     to be “pre-established” and actually co-exist with the “old” Authorized Shops for a period
     of time before the DIFMS Program MS663P “Mass Change for Deleting Authorized

       Shops” runs. The program also updates the New Authorized Shop Conversion-Indicator
       on the Shop Conversion record to signify that this particular mass change process has
       occurred.
       12.4.3.12. DIFMS Program MS663P “Mass Change for Deleting Old Authorized Shops”
       does mass changes to delete old Direct and Indirect Authorized Shops (for the ‘From’
       shop) based on the ‘From’ (Old) shop values on the new DIFMS Shop Conversion record
       and produces the DIFMS Report 7310-112 “Old Authorized Shop”. The report displays
       for each changed record the Job Number, From (Old) Authorized Shop, To (New)
       Authorized Shop and the Shop-Effective-Date. The program only deletes data if the
       Date-Shop-Effective from the Shop Conversion record is less than or equal to the Current
       System Date. It also only succeeds if the Fiscal Year of the Current-Process-Date (from
       the System-Info record) is not less than the Fiscal Year of the Date-Effective. This
       ensures that the process does not run too early and delete records prior to the end of fiscal
       year processing. The program also updates the Deleted Authorized Shop Conversion-
       Indicator on the Shop Conversion record to signify that this particular mass change
       process has occurred.
       12.4.3.13. DIFMS Program MS658P “Shop Conversion Record Purge” deletes the new
       Shop Conversion record based on one of the following two criteria. If all the mass
       change processes have run (signified by a value of ‘Y’ in each of the Travel, Doc-Job-
       Shop, FAA, Labor, Benefiting Shop, New Authorized Shop and Deleted Authorized
       Shop Indicator fields), the Shop Conversion records are purged, with no additional date
       check. If at least one of the mass change processes have run (signified by a value of ‘Y’
       in at least one of the aforementioned Indicator fields) and the Shop-Effective-Date on the
       Shop Conversion Record is more than 45 days earlier than the current date, the Shop
       Conversion record is also purged. The program also produces the DIFMS Report 7310-
       C40 “Shop Conversion Purge”. The report displays the From Shop, To Shop, Effective-
       Date and each of the aforementioned “Indicator” fields (with the value of ‘Y’ indicating
       that particular mass change process had run).
12.5. End of Year Processing and Closeout
   12.5.1. Fiscal Year End (FYE) activities start mid August and continue through the first
   week of October. Telecons start out weekly and change to daily on 28 September.
   Participants are the AFSC Cost Accounting and DFAS Columbus representatives,
   HQ/AFMC/A4N/DMAPS, HQ/AFMC/FM, and ABW/SC attached to each base.

    WORKING CAPITAL FUND MANAGEMENT FOR DEPOT MAINTENANCE

13.1. Working Capital Fund Responsibilities
   13.1.1. The AF established a WCF, CSAG-M, to perform Depot Maintenance for workload
   assigned to the organic activities at WR-ALC, OC-ALC, and OO-ALC. This does not
   preclude direct funded activities from performing depot maintenance as directed by
   competent authority. Financial aspects of depot maintenance are through the Air Force (AF)
   Working Capital Fund (WCF). Use of the WCF is a method of financing the cost of depot
   level maintenance operations by providing initial working capital and allowing recovery of
   operating costs through the sale of products or services. This process is similar to private
   industry by providing for effective and economical use of resources. Management control of
   CSAG-M is assigned to the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). CSAG-M provides for:
      13.1.1.1. Depot Maintenance is the overhaul, conversion, progressive maintenance,
      modernization, modernization-conversion, interim rework, modification, repair,
      regeneration, storage, and disposal of aircraft, missiles, target drones, engines,
      accessories, components, and equipment. Local manufacture, engineering, PMEL,
      software, and Software Consulting (OO-ALC) are also authorized workloads. HQ
      AFMC may authorize additional products or services. If any unauthorized work is
      performed, the revenue is deposited into the US Treasury (Miscellaneous Receipts).
      13.1.1.2. CSAG-M is authorized to provide authorized services or products to the AF
      and other agencies of the Department of Defense (DoD), Foreign Military Sales, other
      Government agencies, and Private parties as authorized by law.
   13.1.2. The WCF provides a business management structure under which both customers
   (mission forces) and providers (support activities) can be made aware of the total funded
   costs of goods and services. Cost visibility not only enables customers to seek the best
   service at the lowest price, but also encourages providers to offer services at the lowest costs
   to remain competitive and viable. As a revolving fund, the following points represent the
   fundamentals:
      13.1.2.1. The depot maintenance portion of the WCF is a method of financing the
      operations of an activity by: (1) providing working capital; (2) allowing for the recovery
      of operating costs through the sale of products or services; and (3) establishing a buyer-
      seller relationship to facilitate the above sales.
      13.1.2.2. The customer (buyer) develops depot maintenance requirements and obtains
      financial authority to pay for the work ordered from the seller.
      13.1.2.3. The seller negotiates with the buyer to fully workload depot maintenance
      capability.
      13.1.2.4. The seller prepares an operating budget showing the projected capability and
      operating expenses for the negotiated workload, and offsetting revenues. Working
      capital (cash) is provided to pay for operations until payments are made by customers.
238                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      13.1.2.5. The customer orders work from depot maintenance. Funded Project Orders
      (PO) are used for all work ordered and accomplished. MIPRS (economy act) are used for
      non DoD US Government customers. When the US government customers’ orders are
      accepted, their funds are obligated, which creates Budgetary Resources for the CSAG-M
      and authorizes the incurrence of obligations for the performance of the customer order.
      13.1.2.6. The product divisions at the Air Logistics Complexes (ALC) negotiate
      workloads and perform the work funded in the POs. As work is done, depot maintenance
      resources are consumed and costs incurred. The WCF pays for these expenses from its
      working capital. Periodic billings are processed to the customer to recover cash paid out
      by the WCF for expenses incurred. Revenue is recognized for cost incurred up to the
      funding level. The payments from customers as the result of billings are used to
      replenish the WCF. As work is completed, depot maintenance final bills the customer.
      Revenue is recognized as work is performed and billed. Any variance between cost and
      funded dollars is acknowledged in the final billing.
      13.1.2.7. The WCF for depot maintenance continues to function as long as orders are
      received from the customer. The end of the FY has no financial significance to the WCF
      as far as the operating cash is concerned. The customer, however, does have the
      challenge of FY limitations since they receive appropriated funds. Once the PO is
      accepted, the customer's appropriation is obligated. Customer’s obligated funds remain
      available for billing until the appropriation cancels.
      13.1.2.8. In addition, the WCF does not have to deal with year-end limitations on the use
      of operating resources as long as it operates within the approved cost authority or obtain
      authorization to increase the cost authority. Cost authority, or the amount "earned,"
      equals the actual workload times the individual cost goals. For depot maintenance, costs
      are authorized only after receiving a customer order. The Annual Operating Budget
      (AOB) document provides the overall cost goal. The total costs allowed depend on the
      cost goals applied to the actual customer-funded workload. The operating cash available
      in the WCF may be used to pay for any resource required for the execution of the CSAG-
      M mission, within legal and regulation limitations. However, administrative limitations
      are placed on the Capital Investment Program (CIP) and may be placed on certain
      resources such as manpower.
      13.1.2.9. The long-range financial objective of depot maintenance is a zero accumulated
      operating result (AOR). AOR is the cumulative sum of the Net Operating Results (NOR)
      from each year.
  13.1.3. Depot maintenance is controlled through AFMC workload planning, programming
  and budgeting systems, and the analysis of key business area financial documents. Customer
  requirements are contained in the production systems, to include: Facility and Equipment
  Maintenance (FEM-D130), Programmed Depot Maintenance Scheduling System (PDMSS-
  G097), and Inventory Tracking System (ITS-G337). (PDMSS and ITS are part of the Depot
  Maintenance System Integration (DMSI) Suite.) The objective of depot maintenance
  management is to efficiently workload and fund capability. This could be accomplished, if
  needed, through adjustments to capability to match requirements. The remaining depot
  maintenance workloads are done by inter-service support. All orders written by depot
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                   239


  maintenance customers must conform to their approved operating program and direct cite
  authority. A budget and execution plan is prepared for each FY.
     13.1.3.1. An operating budget for depot maintenance, which identifies planned expenses
     and revenues related to the sale of products and services, is prepared for each activity.
     The plan is prepared based on estimated customer funding levels, negotiated levels of
     workload, projected expenses, inflation factors, and other financial considerations. This
     process involves the distribution of the capability to specific customer workloads through
     the development of an ALC budget for depot maintenance, and the subsequent
     submission of all required data (including sales prices) to AFMC Directorate of Financial
     Management (AFMC/FM) for inclusion in the consolidated Defense Budget Review
     (DBR) submission. The DBR and the projected sales prices are submitted through the
     Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the
     Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval. This process begins
     approximately two years before the beginning of the applicable FY budget.
     13.1.3.2. The budget serves as the baseline for determining that depot maintenance sales
     rates and prices are adequate to offset expenses, the correct type and volume of sales are
     being planned, and planned expenses for each cost element are consistent with current
     management policy. Targets are developed along budget guidelines for evaluating actual
     operating results during the execution phase.
     13.1.3.3. The billing process is accomplished through the Defense Industrial Financial
     Management System (DIFMS) per Chapter 8 of this instruction. Each depot maintenance
     customer is billed for costs charged to the open job order numbers (JON) that are
     partially complete. The non-serialized workloads are billed at a unit price times the
     quantity of completed units. Serialized workloads are billed at the approved sales rate
     times the number of hours reported as being completed. Revenue is recognized and the
     cost of goods sold is computed as work is performed and billed.
     13.1.3.4. As each JON is completed and closed, final billing is made to the customer
     where any variances between Extended End Item Sales Price (EEISP) and expenses are
     recognized. Prior to JON completion, the JON costs are collected in work-in-process
     (WIP). The Job Order Production Master System (JOPMS-G004L) updates DIFMS
     through the Job Order Status Tool (JOST) to reflect the completed JON. DIFMS
     produces various reports identifying each customer, PO, JON, Program Control Number
     (PCN), Funds Control Reference Number (FCRN), and other information.
     13.1.3.5. As required, ALC personnel provide briefings to AFMC/FM concerning the
     status of depot maintenance execution. AFMC/FM informs the ALCs of formats to use
     and data to present.

13.2. Organization Responsibilities
   13.2.1. The AFMC Commander is the manager of the WCF, including depot maintenance.
   This management responsibility is carried out by the Directorate of Financial Management
   (AFMC/FM) and the Directorate of Logistics and Sustainment (AFMC/A4). AFMC/FM is
   responsible for the budget and financial processes. AFMC/A4 is responsible for the logistics
   functional processes. The official accounting and finance records for depot maintenance are
   maintained in the Defense Industrial Financial Management System (DIFMS). The Defense
   Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) owns this system and the Air Force Sustainment
   Center and Air Logistics Complexes (ALC) in coordination with DFAS provide day-to-day
   management. This day-to-day management includes accounting services for depot
   maintenance, auditing the accounts, preparing reports to reflect the financial status
   accurately, and performing quality reviews of the labor, material and other accounts. The
   ALC product division maintenance activities are responsible for accomplishing workload
   within the approved operating budget using approved prices in conjunction with approved
   customer funding, which requires control of operating costs.
   13.2.2. The following specific responsibilities represent defined tasks but are not the total
   responsibilities to maintain the depot maintenance operation. The detailed mission and
   functional statements of the organizations involved in the management of depot maintenance
   are contained in the AFMC 21-series instructions. The details of how each ALC
   accomplishes the tasks are to be outlined in ALC-specific operating instructions. Other
   chapters in these financial policies and procedures cover related responsibilities.
   13.2.3. AFMC/FM, in conjunction with AFMC/A4, manages the depot maintenance
   program, which includes policy, control, direction, approval, computation analysis, and rate
   establishment. AFMC/FM plans and approves policy and direction for the AFSC/ALC to be
   used in the development of the depot maintenance budget estimates (BE) and annual
   operating targets. AFMC/FM issues requests for the BE and amendments, including formats
   and specific procedures. Additional responsibilities of AFMC/FM are: (1) conducts periodic
   reviews of the operating results and financial status; (2) establishes cost performance goals
   for depot maintenance operations; (3) accomplishes a review and summarization of AFMC
   operating budget and BEs; and (4) establishes policy to ensure that depot maintenance funds
   are used only in the performance of depot maintenance services.
   13.2.4. AFMC/A4 develops, directs, and manages depot maintenance workload programs for
   the operating year and the ensuing budget period. AFMC/A4 also determines the distribution
   of and maintains management control of all depot maintenance manpower resources by
   AFMC activities. AFMC/A4 develops maintenance management information concepts,
   policies and procedures as well as develops and manages programs to measure and monitor
   depot maintenance productivity.

          13.2.5.4.10. Approve any Work Authorization Document (WAD), including
          renegotiation/drive adjustments, POs, or other instruments, to ensure requirements are
          valid and funded.
          13.2.5.4.11. Ensure all workload is funded by a PO and funds are increased or
          decreased if there is a change in the scope of work or quantities.
          13.2.5.4.12. Provide tool crib and Precision Measurement Equipment (PME) support.
13.3. Budgets
   13.3.1. The development of a depot maintenance budget is a complex, lengthy process
   requiring many staff, system, and program interfaces at organization levels from a resource
   control center through the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Comptroller. Since
   the budget is developed within very demanding time constraints, each activity involved must
   carefully plan its role in the development process. This planning effort should provide an
   organized approach, including a schedule for the accomplishment of each action that enables
   completion of the total task within the imposed time constraints. The overall ALC plan
   should be approved by the AFSC commander.
   13.3.2. Productivity initiatives are pursued to improve labor performance, conserve
   resources, devise better work methods and new technologies and are measured with the ratio
   of inputs to outputs for economic and efficiency benefits. Productivity planning entails
   projection of initiative benefits during a budget period in terms of what changes the
   initiatives produce in depot maintenance labor production factors and the dollar savings
   resulting from the planned initiatives. AFMC/A4 furnishes direction on productivity
   planning.
   13.3.3. All resources required to accomplish the planned workload program must be
   included in the budget. The budget for depot maintenance relates expenses to planned
   workload performance, and the budget is designed for internal management of depot
   maintenance.
      13.3.3.1. The ALC/FM prepares the budget and computes the various rates. The
      budgeted costs, when converted to budgeted rates by product, are used by customers to
      budget for the funds required to finance the depot maintenance workload. The budget
      also provides the cost data and activity estimates for evaluating the internal depot
      maintenance operations. These estimates also form the basis for sales rates to be applied
      to production data for determining amounts to be collected from the customers.
      13.3.3.2. The budget is developed at the organizational (RCC) level and summarized by
      line item at the product division level. The budget presents detailed information for
      budgeted RCC personnel equivalents and activity hours, direct/indirect labor,
      direct/indirect material, other direct/indirect cost, Production Overhead (POH), and
      General and Administrative (G&A) overhead.
      13.3.3.3. The H033 BTM supports the organizational budget development from the
      lowest level, Resource Cost Centers (RCC) to the Directorate of Maintenance. This
244                                                           AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      module is used to develop the ALC Directorate of Maintenance Budget that is submitted
      to AFMC for the current BE. Once budget development is complete and approved by the
      ALC, this data is incorporated into the H033 Cost and Production Performance Module
      (CPPM) for monthly actual versus target variance analysis. This allows financial
      managers the ability on a monthly basis to provide detailed analysis on the execution of
      the budget to AFMC. H033 provides information for budget exhibits to the PLA to
      G004C. The system also provides rates to the DMAPS Data Store System (DDS) and
      OARs and Transfer Percentages to DIFMS. BTM functionality is described in the
      following sub-paragraphs.
         13.3.3.3.1. Productivity factors are calculated in BTM and interfaced into CPPM for
         an actual to target comparison of productivity factors for analysis purposes.
         13.3.3.3.2. BTM is used to create planned Overhead Application Rates (OAR).
         DIFMS requires planned OARs to apply overhead expenses to the direct JONs. The
         overhead is applied to the Direct Production JONs based on the OAR rates. BTM
         calculates these rates and automatically passes the rates to DIFMS at the beginning of
         each fiscal year, or as needed.
         13.3.3.3.3. BTM is used in the calculation of the cost transfer percentages so actual
         overhead expenses can be allocated to direct organizations.
         13.3.3.3.4. BTM is the only system in which RCC expense rates are calculated at the
         various cost elements which allows detailed analysis to be conducted. The rates are
         input into G004C and used to develop EISPs and temporary workload prices.
         13.3.3.3.5. BTM provides the output data required to complete the budget statements
         that must be forwarded to AFMC in the required format (IF-3).
         13.3.3.3.6. BTM has the ability to process “What If” scenarios, which allows
         management to build a budget with different option.
         13.3.3.3.7. BTM has the ability to copy historical data from CPPM. This feature
         allows all the historical information for each RCC to be copied into an estimated
         budget (referred to as a model) providing data accuracy and the foundation to begin
         detailed budget development.
         13.3.3.3.8. BTM breaks the yearly budget into monthly targets. The targets reflect
         the budgeted costs per the number of work hours in a month.
         13.3.3.3.9. BTM is able to perform true rollup of RCC data based on the proper
         management chain, allowing accurate cost targets to be developed.
         13.3.3.3.10. BTM has merge model capability allows the directorate models to be
         merged into a final ALC model.
      13.3.3.4. The budget for the current year of the BE is prepared for each out year of the
      BE. Data input to the budget is developed at RCC level. When actual history is at
      section or higher level, identical rates for each RCC within that organization are
      authorized.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                    245


        13.3.3.4.1. The account structure used in the budget and the actual data in the
        operating cost report must be directly related to the organizational structure of depot
        maintenance.
        13.3.3.4.2. Indirect labor factors (ILF) are the ratio of non-direct time to direct time
        in RCCs. These factors must be developed according to procedures outlined in
        AFMCI 21-105, Depot Maintenance Work Measurement.
        13.3.3.4.3. The budget submission must include documentation that identifies,
        explains, and supports the planned productivity changes.
        13.3.3.4.4. The planned labor is developed after workload requirements have been
        determined. This process balances available manpower to workload requirements
        and expresses manpower requirements in terms of personnel equivalents.
           13.3.3.4.4.1. Workload projections are based on the latest available data from
           G097 and adjusted for such factors as customer funding levels, historical non-
           generation of assets, inventory reductions, system errors, process improvement,
           and workload shifts. Since these workload projections form the basis for budget
           development, the workload must be approved by AFMC/A4 prior to development
           of the planned labor. Workload requirements are expressed in standard hours.
           13.3.3.4.4.2. Options to increase capability must be reflected according to
           AFMC/A4 budget direction.
           13.3.3.4.4.3. The Maintenance Groups are responsible for providing planned
           labor data to the ALC/FM for budget consolidation within AFMC & AFSC and
           locally established periods.
               13.3.3.4.4.3.1. After determining production capability, the following
               overhead end strength data is required. These procedures apply to both
               civilian and military personnel. The ALC distributes military end strengths to
               each maintenance group. Each maintenance group identifies civilian
               manpower authorization by organization.
               13.3.3.4.4.3.2. All depot maintenance costs must be projected and correctly
               classified in one of the expense categories as shown in the below table. The
               ALC consolidates all expenses for inclusion in the budget. Expenses
               chargeable to depot maintenance are per the direction in the paragraphs
               following the table.
 246                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014




Table 13.1. Expense Categories
Expense Category          Explanation
Direct production         Includes direct labor, direct material, and other direct costs
                          (direct contractual services and operational TDY costs)
                          required to accomplish specific depot maintenance
                          workloads.
Production Overhead       Costs incurred by or allocated from the directorate to an RCC
                          that cannot be economically identified to job orders. These
                          costs include RCC indirect labor, indirect material, indirect
                          other costs (Cost Class IV) incurred by the RCC, and shop
                          support expense (section, branch, division, and directorate
                          management; scheduling and planning; engineering and
                          quality) allocated to the RCC.
G&A Overhead              All depot maintenance costs outside the maintenance groups
                          or not classified as production overhead.
          13.3.3.4.5. The labor cost for both civilian and military personnel is computed as part
          of the budget procedure. The distribution of labor costs within depot maintenance
          must be compatible with established planned labor and overhead manpower
          procedures.
             13.3.3.4.5.1. Cost of cash awards should be budgeted based on a predetermined
             percentage of base pay for incentive awards. Is calculated by using past
             experience for suggestion awards.
             13.3.3.4.5.2. Workmen’s compensation information is provided by AFMC/FMR.
             13.3.3.4.5.3. Depot maintenance plans for a limited amount of overtime to offset
             irregularities in work schedules. This overtime is part of normal depot
             maintenance operations to ensure a smooth flow in repair processes.
          13.3.3.4.6. Material costs:
          13.3.3.4.6.1. RCC historical rates are compiled for direct and indirect expense and
          investment material. Projected material rates are adjusted based on projected
          workloads and any known variable factors. The product directors review and approve
          these material rates.
             13.3.3.4.6.2. Maintenance group budget team members prepare the material
             budget for their overhead organizations.
          13.3.3.4.7. Business operations costs must be prepared per locally-published
          direction and schedules. They are reflected by individual expense elements as
          follows, and as further defined in Chapter 5 of the financial policies and procedures.
             13.3.3.4.7.1. Temporary duty travel, per-diem, and vehicle rental costs must be
             separately identified for each category (e.g., direct, production overhead and
             G&A). Direct travel should be related to off-base workloads. Administrative
             travel should be based on experience, adjusted as required, by known program
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                   247


           changes. This item must include travel associated with off-base training.
           13.3.3.4.7.2. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) expenses (travel/per diem,
           shipment of household goods, real estate, and miscellaneous) for civilian
           employee PCS moves should be based on experience and anticipated
           requirements.
           13.3.3.4.7.3. Estimates for contractual services for repair of depot maintenance
           owned equipment, shop rearrangements, and any other contracts written solely for
           depot maintenance direct citation of depot maintenance funds are based on
           projected requirements.
           13.3.3.4.7.4. Contractor Support for Field Services and (DOCAT). The cost of
           contractor personnel who perform field service contracts or on-site support (such
           as DOCAT) is allocated in the budget process to the production RCC, to the
           maintenance group to retain the cost against specific workloads. DOCAT has to
           be direct labor and assigned to direct RCCs.
           13.3.3.4.7.5. Budget for the cost of training attendance for depot maintenance
           employees in technical and management courses. This provides for the cost of
           tuition for job-related courses taken by depot maintenance employees, and a pro
           rata share for instructors brought on base. This excludes Air Education and
           Training Command (AETC) funded schools. Estimate costs in coordination with
           the ALC training office.
           13.3.3.4.7.6. Utility costs for billing purposes are obtained by metered services or
           engineering estimates subject to annual review. Projected costs should be
           obtained in coordination with the local civil engineer. Depot maintenance and the
           base civil engineer approve a written Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
           providing the utility rates and services. This MOA is reviewed and updated each
           year. In the MOA, show separate estimates for purchased utilities and
           maintenance.
           13.3.3.4.7.7. All printing and reproduction services ordered by depot
           maintenance are included except the printing of technical data such as technical
           orders (TO). Estimates of cost should be obtained through coordination with the
           local printing manager.
           13.3.3.4.7.8. Communications services covers commercial telephone, long
           distance tolls, and all communications equipment and services rendered
           exclusively for the use of depot maintenance. Leasing, rentals, and purchase of
           equipment (less than the CIP threshold) are acceptable for inclusion in this
           category.
           13.3.3.4.7.9. Estimates for equipment rented for the exclusive use of depot
           maintenance should be based on historical data, adjusted by requirements.
           13.3.3.4.7.10. Vehicle maintenance is covered for those vehicles assigned to
           depot maintenance.
           13.3.3.4.7.11. Custodial Services support is based on depot maintenance and civil
           engineer estimates by type of service.
248                                                      AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      13.3.3.4.7.12. Base Operating Support (BOS) covers the depot maintenance share
      of services provided by the base where the depot is located based upon a signed
      support agreement. BOS includes reimbursable costs of support by such activities
      as chaplain services, libraries, fitness support, civilian personnel clubs,
      food/health/lodging facilities, data automation, fire protection, base
      administration, security services, environmental management, financial
      management, and services provided by DFAS. The preceding list is only a
      sample and not to be interpreted as complete. Costs are estimated according to
      local needs. Sufficient documentation should be available to support and explain
      each of the costs included in the budget. For each budget, appropriate personnel
      from the ALC/FM, AFSC/FM, and the supporting organizations identify those
      positions dedicated to support of depot maintenance for inclusion in the signed
      support agreement. Agreements are valid only when signed at the directorate
      level in ALC/FM, AFSC/FM, and the organization furnishing the support. In the
      ALC budget submission to AFMC/FM, separately identify each of the BOS costs,
      provide a copy of the signed support agreement as justification, and show the
      United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) account codes where costs are
      accumulated during the execution year.
      13.3.3.4.7.13. Defense Information Services Agency (DISA) Support covers
      computer-processing services for the depot maintenance operations.
      13.3.3.4.7.14. Facility maintenance, repair, alterations, and architectural and
      engineering (A&E) includes facility alterations (less than the CIP threshold),
      repair (cost limited to budgeted totals), facility maintenance to buildings
      belonging to depot maintenance, and A&E. Estimated costs are developed in
      coordination with civil engineering and the depot maintenance facility and
      equipment programming function. Projects are classified as maintenance, repair,
      or alteration, per AFMCI 21-109. The following applies:
      13.3.3.4.7.15. Maintenance is the recurrent, day-to-day, periodic, or scheduled
      work required to preserve real property facilities.
      13.3.3.4.7.16. Repair is the restoration of real property facilities, or constituent
      components, to such a condition that the property may be effectively used for its
      designated purpose. Repair may include replacement of constituent parts,
      material, and real property installed equipment.
      13.3.3.4.7.17. Alteration projects funded are limited to those clearly defined as
      adjustments of the interior arrangements, reconfiguration, repositioning,
      relocation, or altering other physical characteristics of an existing facility so it
      may be more effectively used for its designated purpose. Additions, expansions,
      and extensions qualify as alterations if the cost is less than the CIP threshold.
      Alteration projects for a facility are not subdivided to avoid exceeding the
      threshold.
      13.3.3.4.7.18. Architectural & Engineering (A&E) costs for depot maintenance
      facility projects (whether prepared by civil engineering or contractor) may be
      budgeted. A&E design costs are not considered as part of the total cost of facility
      alteration projects for purposes of project funding limitations. This category
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                       249


              should only be used for A&E charges for expensed projects. A&E charges for
              capitalized projects (i.e., minor construction projects greater than the CIP
              threshold and less than military construction program) should be capitalized and
              depreciated.
              13.3.3.4.7.19. Automated data processing management system development
              includes costs directly associated with accomplishment of data automation
              development requirements for depot maintenance. Depot maintenance pays for
              projects that are less than the CIP threshold and have a useful life of less than two
              years. These costs are expensed in the year that costs occur. Depot maintenance
              pays for the continued operating costs of current systems that are the
              responsibility of the depot maintenance community.
              13.3.3.4.7.20. The ALCs are responsible to budget for personnel and associated
              costs for headquarters depot maintenance support organizations. Each ALC is
              notified by AFMC/FM of their share for reimbursement of these costs.
              13.3.3.4.7.21. Under the CIP, depreciation/amortization is an expense and
              includes equipment depreciation, minor construction depreciation, and
              management information systems amortization.
      13.3.3.5. At the conclusion of the budget development process, the completed budget is
      reviewed, consolidated, and approved by the ALC financial management office and
      submitted to the AFSC/FM for approval.
   13.3.4. The depot maintenance Defense Budget Review (DBR) is based on budgeted cost
   and planned labor information developed as previously explained in paragraph 13.3.3.
   Information and instruction for budget submissions are explained in AFI 65-601, Volume 3,
   the AF Budget Corporate Process, and budget direction published yearly by AFSC and
   AFMC/FM. The narrative furnished for budget formats must explain, as a minimum, reasons
   for changes addressed between all years.
   13.3.5. Each ALC establishes monthly operating targets that are based on direction provided
   by AFSC/FM and AFMC/FM.
13.4. Rates and Prices
   13.4.1. Rates and prices are constructed to recover the funded depot maintenance costs of
   producing goods and services and incorporate RMDs (iterative pricing is how—not what is
   in the rates--the rates are set for CSAG-S. Application of rates and prices is by category of
   repair work (RGC). This section covers the development and application of those rates and
   prices. The only exceptions authorized are additional costs to recover non-WCF expenses
   (unfunded) from non-DoD customers (FMS excluded) and special rates and prices.
   Customers of depot maintenance require advance knowledge of rates and prices to budget for
   their requirements.
      13.4.1.1. Depot maintenance rates and prices are subject to the DoD rate stabilization
      program per DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 11B, Chapter 11. Rate stabilization is to ensure
      the customer's program is accomplished within the customer's approved funding and to
      aid the customer in developing their budget. Fixed prices are used for planned workload
250                                                            AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


      and Fixed Rates are used for unplanned workload (FMS accepted). Only significant
      gains and losses meeting specific ground rules are basis for changing rates and prices.
      13.4.1.2. The ALC is responsible for the development of depot maintenance rates and
      prices. These are initially developed for the FY in conjunction with the development of
      the BE for that year. Adjustments to rates and prices are based on RMDs and iterative
      pricing (iterative pricing only applies to CSAG-S)
      13.4.1.3. A modification installation sales rate should not include direct material costs
      associated with a modification kit. The direct material associated with Aircraft
      Modification workload will be purchased and furnished by the program office in the form
      of modification kits, and as such, it would not be appropriate to charge the Programmed
      Depot Maintenance sales rate that includes a direct material expense that is included
      within the modification kit. Any miscellaneous direct material cost over and above the
      material provided with the modification kit should be included in the modification sales
      rate. Any material used for repairs will be charged to the customer and not the
      modification.
      13.4.1.4. When a modification is performed in conjunction with a PDM or other planned
      maintenance, the PDM or other planned maintenance will fund common tasks. The
      modification will fund only the additional costs. For example, if a panel needs to be
      removed for both the PDM and the modification, the PDM will fund both the removal
      and replacement.
  13.4.2. Hourly rates used in the depot maintenance community are made up of various
  elements, themselves sometimes called rates. Typically, those elements are: (1) direct labor;
  (2) direct material; (3) direct other (i.e., TDY, DOCAT, direct contracts); (4) POH; and (5)
  G&A overhead. While expressing these terms as rates has valid applications, the rates
  referred to within this policy and procedures are the totals of all these elements. The
  following paragraphs identify the various rates and prices and their uses.
  13.4.3. Sales Rates and Prices
      13.4.3.1. Sales rates are applied to Repair Group Categories (RGC) of work. They are
      generally comprised of a combination of several RCC rates, since seldom does only one
      RCC perform all the maintenance on an entire category of work. Sales rates may contain
      more than just RCC cost elements if directed by higher headquarters. Once established,
      RCC rates are used as the basis for negotiation of all non-programmed work. Note: Sales
      rates are fixed if planned and fixed rate per hour if unplanned.
      13.4.3.2. The concept of fixed pricing applies to serialized (programmed - RGC A, C,
      and G) workload, such as aircraft, missiles, and Other Major End Items (OMEI). For
      each major end item, a basic price is published for repair. The tasks and number of
      DPSH are determined by the appropriate planning/workload activity, but must be directly
      traceable to Aircraft and Missiles Requirements Database (AMRD) tasks and hours.
      13.4.3.3. RCC rates are those costs incurred by a direct labor organization. An RCC rate
      includes all elements of labor, material, production overhead, and G&A overhead. RCC
      rates are used in the development of End Item Sales Prices (EISP). RCC rates may also
      be used as sales rates for non-programmed work.
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                      251


     13.4.3.4. The use of EISPs applies to engines and Management if Items Subject to
     Repair (MISTR) workload. EISPs are those prices charged the customer for programmed
     repair of single items, such as an indicator or a fuel pump. The same price is charged for
     depot maintenance of all items of the same National Stock Number (NSN) inducted
     under a specific production number, regardless of quantity or condition.
     13.4.3.5. The rates and prices are subject to the DoD rate stabilization policy. This
     policy states that prices charged to customers reflect the financial projections contained in
     the approved budget estimate. Further, the policy is that overall prices are stabilized in
     such a manner that individual price changes do not create an adverse impact on any
     individual customer, and are accomplished within the operating profits and losses in the
     approved operating budget. AFMC/FM & AFSC/FM evaluates all change proposals
     against total business area operations to ensure strict compliance with the basic policy.
     Policy currently allows for changes to sales rates and EISP changes for reduced prices
     because of new methods, processes, equipment, or management actions that significantly
     reduce maintenance costs. DMAPS provides a capability for supporting rates and prices
     updates per this policy.
     13.4.3.6. RCC rates are established and loaded into G004C. SPG uses those rates to
     calculate End Item Sales Prices (EISP) for all programmed NSNs. EISPs are computed
     by multiplying the labor standard Direct Product Standard Hours (DPSH) for each
     operation by the labor, POH, and G&A budgeted rates for the RCC in which the
     operation is performed and then adding direct material costs and any other direct costs as
     applicable. Construction of EISPs is dependent on information from four sources:
     G004C-Depot Maintenance Workload Planning & Control System (DMWPCS), G005M-
     Depot Maintenance Material Support System (DMMSS), E046B-Labor Standard
     Mechanized System - Maintenance (LSMSM), and a file maintenance action to SPG.

Table 13.2. Explanation of Process Steps for Calculating Rates and Prices
 #    Explanation
 1    In Q302/G005M, planners update material standards, verify replacement factors, and
      remove excess material. DMAPS provides source of task-based data to assess standards
      and factors. In Q302/E046B, planners update labor standards and verify occurrence
      factors. These standards are interfaced to the SPG (within DDS) for building sales price
      for permanent, non-serialized end items (commodities and engines).
 2    Q302/G005M pushes updated Material Standards to the SPG. SPG uses the information
      for building direct material sales prices for permanent, non-serialized end items
      (commodities and engines).
 3    Q302/E046B pushes labor standards to the SPG for building sales price for permanent,
      non-serialized end items (commodities and engines).
 4    Budget analysts convert the budgeted expense amounts to the RCC rates.
 5    Budget Analysts follow local ALC guidelines to enter the RCC rates into G004C. These
      rates are segregated by the cost elements of direct labor, direct expense material, direct
      exchange material, direct non-exchange material, other direct costs, production overhead,
      and G&A.
 6    Aircraft Repair Enhancement Program (AREP) Planners establish labor hours based on
      the batch quantity to facilitate batch processing. The Planners use G097 to plan and
      control the modification/repair of aircraft and other project type workloads. This
      includes developing and inputting labor standards and base hours. When the Planner
      selects operation to be included in a given overhaul, G097 uses base hours for detail
      planning. Tasks are transmitted to the DDS and TAA when the scheduler changes status
      code to ‘0’.
 7    SPG Calculates End Item Sales Rates/Prices for Temporary Workload. G004C sends
      approved RCC rates to G004L to be used to build temporary workload sales prices.
      G004L passes planned standard hours and/or planned material costs by RCC to DDS for
      each temporary JON opening or amendment to a temporary JON. G004L also provides a
      daily feed of the permanent JON masters from G004L to DDS to support the JOST and
      various reporting requirements. DDS multiplies planned hours by RCC by the: approved
      labor rate, material rate, other direct cost rate, production overhead rate, and general and
      administrative rate. This process yields the end item rates/prices for temporary
      workload. These data are maintained in DDS. Planned material costs may be used in
      lieu of material rates for temporary JONs.
 8    Review and Set RGC and Mission, Design, Series (MDS) Rates. After G004C calculates
      RGC and MDS rates, Budget Analysts review them for accuracy and known engineering
      and/or workload changes. These calculations result in the rates and dollars by cost
      element and by RGC. Aircraft rates by MDS are also available. The material rates may
      be adjusted using COGS history as a guide. The Aircraft MDS rates are used for pricing
      each PDM package. The RGC rates are for planning purposes only as they represent
      only one workload mix.
 9    Run G004C for MDS and RGC Planning Rates.
254                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


 #     Explanation
10     Calculate the permanent, non-serialized end item prices in RGC E (engines) and RGC J
       (commodities), also known as MISTR. The prices are generated in the SPG after it
       receives the following data: material cost from the G005M after adjustments for
       replacement and occurrence factors, occurrence labor standard from E046B, and
       RCC/Shop rates from G004C. RCC rates and occurrence labor standards are multiplied
       together to produce labor and overhead dollars.
11     Calculate RGC Engine Rates (OC-ALC only). Engine rates are needed at OC-ALC only.
       Process is similar to other workload types.
12     After the SPG calculates EISP, the prices are reviewed by the Budget Analyst for
       accuracy and known engineering/workload changes. If adjustment is required the EISP
       is recalculated in the SPG. Once prices have been set, they are passed to G004L, G019C
       and Q310.
13     EISP is fed to the DDS by the SPG to facilitate profit and loss variance analysis by RCC
       by cost element.
14     The SPG Sends EISPs to G004L.
15     Budget analysts manually load MDS and other serialized workload rates approved by
       HQ-AFMC into the DDS. Adjustments to hourly sales rates may be required on
       individual aircraft in order to stay within fixed price for billing.
     13.4.4. At the beginning of each FY, the approved RCC sales rates are overlaid from G004C
     to G004L. When the planning for each temporary job is completed, G004L computes the
     unit price by extending each RCCs planned DPSH by the RCC approved rate. At this point,
     material costs are added either from the JON Bill of Materials or by using the RCC direct
     material rate, depending on how the JON is coded. Other direct costs (operational TDY,
     contractor support) identified on the JON are also included. To obtain the Unit Sale Price
     (USP), divide total computation by the Job Order Quantity (JOQ). If the total planned cost
     exceeds the customer's estimated costs, a notification of this condition is forwarded to the
     customer. The customer must respond within 10 days by raising the estimated total job cost,
     reducing the JOQ, or canceling the job. If no response is received, the job may be canceled.
     Addendums to the JON that change any of the conditions used to compute the original price
     trigger a re-computation of the price during the FY in which it was opened. Changes made
     after the end of the FY do not cause a new price to be computed. The exception to this
     policy is on local manufacture jobs for a stock fund. These prices are computed only once,
     when the planning is completed. Software is sold in the same manner as non-programmed
     workload. The sales price is determined by multiplying RCC rates times hours.
     13.4.5. Engine prices are comprised of job and non-job routed accessories. Non-job routed
     items are purchased from the supply portion of the WCF and are captured as exchange
     material. Job routed accessories are removed from the engine and repaired in the
     exchangeable line under a production number distinct from the engine. To complete the total
     engine price, the value of the job-routed repair must be computed. Using the exchangeable
     sales prices and a matrix of engine production numbers related to exchangeable production
     numbers, the sales prices for all the job and non-job routed items are summarized for a
     specific engine production number. A review of the matrix, particularly the standard
     replacement percents, should be conducted to ensure that both the exchange material portion
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                    255


  and the job and non-job routed portion accurately reflect the proper engine price. Normally
  the planning function within the responsible maintenance group performs this review.
  13.4.6. Sales rates are submitted to AFSC/FM and AFMC/FM as planning rates and
  proposed sales rates. All the rates may need to be adjusted later to reflect budget changes
  approved by Program Budget Decisions (PBD) and/or iterative pricing. The original G004C
  RCC rates, G005M material standards and E046B labor standards for use in the re-
  computations of prices, are stored to incorporate future PBD adjustments. All FY sales
  prices are approved by AFSC/FM and then submitted to AFMC/FM for finalization. After
  approval, AFMC/FM notifies the AFSC & ALCs of approval and publishes the FY planning
  rates. Approved sales rates and EISPs are provided to the customer prior to the beginning of
  the year of execution. When sales rate and EISP changes are approved during the year of
  execution, the revised sales rates and EISPs are also furnished to the customer immediately.
  In all cases, they are distributed no later than 15 days preceding the effective date of the
  change.
  13.4.7. Changes to Sales Rates and EISPs
     13.4.7.1. Sales rate and EISP changes should be proposed for three primary reasons: (1)
     to adjust for work scope changes; (2) to reduce prices as a result of new methods,
     processes, equipment, or management actions that significantly reduce maintenance
     costs; (3) errors in pricing.
     13.4.7.2. To request a change complete the following:
         13.4.7.2.1. The requesting maintenance group forwards a change request to the
         ALC/FM.
         13.4.7.2.2. The ALC/FM reviews the submission and forward to the AFSC/FM and
         AFMC/FM for further processing and submits to AFMC/FM. Note: That while
         approval is not within the authority of the ALC, those submissions not meeting
         criteria as specified above may be disapproved.
         13.4.7.2.3. AFMC/FM reviews and forwards to SAF/FM as necessary.
  13.4.8. Aircraft, missile, and OMEI fixed prices are those prices charged the customer for
  programmed depot maintenance, and are computed before the beginning of the FY. The
  exact date for completion of these prices will be established yearly by HQ AFMC/FM.
     13.4.8.1. Programmed aircraft, missile, and OMEI work must have a quantifiable,
     specific requirement. These tasks are based on specific hours that have a non-engineered
     or engineered standard. The standard PDM, Analytic Condition Inspection (ACI), or
     upgrade work package will be established with a fixed price. Significant workloads that
     fall out of the standard PDM/ACI package will be considered options. The number of
     options that can accompany a basic package is unlimited, but all options must be fixed
     priced.
     13.4.8.2. Fixed prices are developed for each MDS and are comprised of three elements:
     basic, options, and over and above.
         13.4.8.2.1. The basic portion of a fixed price is that price charged for each and every
         like aircraft, missile, or item undergoing PDM, regardless of condition, for a
         predetermined series of common depot maintenance tasks. The basic charge is
256                                                              AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


         computed by multiplying the number of DPSH by the approved sales rates. The tasks
         and number of DPSH are determined by the appropriate planning/workload activity,
         but must be directly traceable to Aircraft and Missiles Requirements Database
         (AMRD) tasks and hours. Generally, tasks with 100 percent occurrence factors are
         included in the basic package.
         13.4.8.2.2. Options are those tasks that are not common to every induction. This
         element allows the customer and the depot to determine each price according to the
         needs of the end item. For example, a modification may not be required for all
         inductions. Likewise, not all aircraft may require painting. By identifying such tasks
         as options and computing a price for each, the customer is provided a shopping list,
         and the depot is given a more finite work specification. In most cases, the price for
         each option is determined by multiplying the task hours (from AMRD or Time
         Compliance Technical Order (TCTO)) by the rates.
         13.4.8.2.3. Over and Above consists of those tasks that cannot be reasonably
         identified prior to induction and are not within the scope of the basic or option
         packages. The price is obtained by multiplying negotiated hours by the rates. Over
         and above is worked on a separate JON from that of the basic and options. It is
         recorded as ‘unplanned’ and as it is a cost line, the amount obligated at the end of the
         fiscal year the funds expire becomes the cost ceiling All over and above must be
         approved by the Project Administration Officer (PAO) and funds manager (reference
         AFMCI 21-133). Work may not be accomplished before the customer provides the
         required funds.
      13.4.8.3. Fixed pricing as a concept is used in depot maintenance data systems. It
      applies to the basic portion of the fixed price and options, including TCTOs. The fixed
      pricing system procedures do not apply to over and above, however, as this is charged at
      normal hourly rates on a separate JON. Exercise caution to "back out" any over and
      above JON hours included in the basic price. Typically, the AMRD brochure includes a
      small block of over and above hours. Fixed prices are documented on fixed price
      worksheets in formats required by AFMC/FM guidance. Necessary coordination and
      approval of completed worksheets and amendments will vary according to organization.
      13.4.8.4. The hours for tasks must be directly traceable to Aircraft and Missiles
      Requirements Database (AMRD) brochure task hours. Additionally, hours (consequently
      prices) for options must be traceable to either AMRD or TCTO hours. Traceable does
      not mean identical, as all duplicate or redundant tasks must be removed when a task is
      performed in conjunction with PDM. Any differences between planned hours and hours
      as stated in the AMRD brochure or TCTOs must be reconciled. However, the depot
      maintenance standards are the authoritative documents regarding the number of hours per
      task. If incorrect hours are stated in either of these, then appropriate approval for changes
      in hours must be received first by the AMRD, followed by a request and subsequent
      approval for a fixed price change before the customer can be charged a different price.
      13.4.8.5. Changes to fixed prices fall into three categories:
         13.4.8.5.1. A Category 1 change is one that affects all MDS worked for a FY and
         usually involves a change of scope. For example, the addition of 100 hours to an F-
         15C basic package for inspection and increased test requirements. These changes
AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014                                                                     257


         may affect either basic hours or option hours. Unless disapproved locally, the
         ALC/FM will forward all requests for changes to fixed prices to AFSC/FM and HQ
         AFMC/FM for approval using the format required by AFMC/FM guidance. Requests
         will be in narrative form and identify specifics as to tasks and hours accomplished.
         13.4.8.5.2. A Category 2 change is the addition or deletion of complete option tasks,
         such as the issuance or rescission of a TCTO. These changes may be approved by the
         AFSC/FM, and HQ AFMC/FM will be provided copies of updated fixed price
         worksheets.
         13.4.8.5.3. A Category 3 change is a change to the initial fixed price of an individual
         aircraft, by either the addition or deletion of an option, or an increase in over and
         above hours due to discovery of out-of-scope work. These changes cannot affect the
         prices of individual options or the basic package price, and the changes are
         documented on fixed price worksheets by processing an amendment to the initial
         worksheet.
         13.4.8.5.4. Approval authority will vary due to ALC organizational structure and
         source of funds. At a minimum, however, approval requires the signature of the
         funds manager empowered with the obligation authority for customer funds, whether
         local or at command level, with concurrence of the project manager.
  13.4.9. Special Sales Rates and EISPs
     13.4.9.1. Some job orders are outside the normal range, and provisions have been made
     for special rates and prices for these JONs.
         13.4.9.1.1. Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) customers are
         billed for all items of work based on the number of DPSH reported during a month
         times the RCC rate. DPSHs are accumulated against a "C" prefix production number
         that identifies the customer. All DPSHs reported are sold at the end of each month,
         and a new monthly JON is automatically created in G004L for the next month's work.
         13.4.9.1.2. Aircraft Battle Damage Repair special rate involves a workload that is
         generally a long flow extending over a period of 2 or more years. AFMC/FM must
         approve special rates for this type of work. Development is as follows:
            13.4.9.1.2.1. Use the current approved MDS rate to determine the cost to the
            customer for the Examination and Inventory (E&I) of the damaged aircraft. After
            determining the extent of the damage and material requirements, a special rate
            may be requested for the repair using a new temporary production number.
            13.4.9.1.2.2. Determine the number of FYs required to repair the aircraft.
            13.4.9.1.2.3. Determine the DPSHs to be earned by each RCC.
            13.4.9.1.2.4. Develop the direct labor and overhead costs using the RCC DPSHs
            and current approved RCC rates.
            13.4.9.1.2.5. Obtain material costs from the material and parts list developed
            during the E&I.
            13.4.9.1.2.6. Inflate the labor and material costs to cover anticipated increases for
            subsequent FYs.
258                                                         AFMCI65-101 17 JUNE 2014


         13.4.9.1.2.7. If inflation guidance is not available, contact AFMC/FM.
         13.4.9.1.2.8. Depending on the flow time anticipated to repair the damaged
         aircraft, develop a rate for each FY. Develop a composite/weighted average rate
         from these anticipated costs. Use this composite rate to price out the entire repair
         package to the customer.
         13.4.9.1.2.9. Submit the detailed method used in developing the special rate
         along with the request for special rate approval.
         13.4.9.1.2.10. Upon approval, notify the workload and PO functional offices of
         the sales rate to be used for the repair.
      13.4.9.1.3. It is not the intent of the stabilized rate policy for depot maintenance to
      perform work at a loss. This would automatically occur if multiple year workload
      projects were priced at the price in effect when the workload was inducted.
      Workloads that fit this category include, but are not limited to, long-term software
      projects, aircraft crash battle damage repair, local manufacture requirements with
      long lead-times for material, and some OMEI workloads. When these workloads are
      negotiated, pricing should be developed based on the projected amount of work that is
      accomplished in each year and the projected cost for the work that is performed in
      each year.

A2.1. Documentation regarding interfaces with the DMAPS Suite of Systems: Including
ABOM, NIMMS, DIFMS, TAA, and DMAPS Integration Engine is available with appropriate
access to the following CDRS website: Corporate Data Repository System: https://cdrs-
pro.wpafb.af.mil/index.html
   A2.1.1. The DMAPS ICD charts are located on the DMAPS SharePoint EIM site:
   https://cs.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/dmapspmo/DMAPS%20Program%20Support%20Librar
   y/Technical/ICDs/ICD%20Charts (SharePoint access required)
A2.2. ABOM – Automated Bill of Materials – is the primary system utilized in material
requisitioning and ordering within DMAPS. ABOM provides the ability to query Bill of
Materials (BOMs), order material (batch, single, pick list), and request verification and
query/report functions. ABOM is a front-end system to NIMMS which performs validation and
compares the requested material with the Q302/G005M and Q302/G004L BOMs, generates
order/requisition/history records, and maintains an audit trail of activity.
A2.3. NIMMS – NAVAIR Industrial Material Management System is the primary system
utilized in material management within DMAPS. Personnel who order parts for the repair
process will use the ABOM front end to initiate the request. ABOM will interface with NIMMS
and update the material records. If the requested part is not in NIMMS stock, a backorder will be
created and passed through Q302/G402A to D035K.
A2.4. DIFMS – Defense Industrial Financial Management System consists of several
subsystems: Cash, Labor, Other Cost, Material, Cost Summary, Job Order/Customer Order
(JO/CO), Billing, General Ledger Accounts (GLA), Purge and History, system parameters, fixed
asset accounting (FAA), cost completions, and budget tracking. These subsystems work in
concert to provide field level and Headquarters level activities with funds control, accounting for
budget execution, and management information.
A2.5. TAA – Time and Attendance provides the capability to capture and report employee labor
data to financial, payroll, and production processing, for all DMAG (Depot Maintenance
Activity Group) employees through a single source of input at either the Job Order Number
(JON) and/or the operation/sub-operation level.
A2.6. DMAPS Integration Engine – The DMAPS Integration Engine has nine components:
User Access Tool (UAT)
   A2.6.1. The UAT provides the Integration Engine administrator with the ability to establish
   and maintain user access to the various tools offered by the IE. The UAT allows the user to
   grant access to the following tools: UAT, Funding Initiation Tool (FIT), RCC/Skill Codes
   (RSC), Employee ID Generator (EIG), Job Order Status Tool (JOST), and Sales Price
   Generator (SPG).
A2.7. Employee ID Generator (EIG). The EIG assigns a unique 6-position number for each
employee via the EIG Graphical User Interface (GUI) to create and maintain Employee ID data
and associated reports.

A2.8. Conversion Engine (CE or CONEN The CE is Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC)
developed middle-ware used to translate information between AF legacies and
DIFMS/NIMMS/TAA (Defense Industrial Financial Management System / NAVAIR Industrial
Material Management System / Time and Attendance System) other than those that pass through
the Integration Engine.
A2.8.1. The CE will service the data extraction, data posting, data conversion (as required),
scheduling and event processing associated with each data transfer. The CE populates an audit
database of processed conversions and the transaction files used for the conversions.
A2.9. DMAPS Data Store (DDS). The DDS is a system used to warehouse and research
transactions from DMAPS suite of systems. The DDS is a relational database repository
allowing a variety of functional end users to inquire and retrieve production information.
A2.10. RCC/Skill Codes (RSC). RSC is used to provide a relational database repository
allowing designated users to establish and maintain relationships between Resource Control
Centers (RCCs), the financial organization, and Skill Codes, the work qualifications.
A2.11. Job Order Status Tool (JOST). JOST is a middle-ware tool that allows for trailing
costs to be collected in Q302/G004L before financially closing and final billing a JON in
DIFMS.
A2.12. Cost Performance and Budget Module (CPBM). CPBM consists of two parts: Cost
and Production Performance Module (CPPM) and Budget Target Module (BTM). BTM also
includes functionality of the Cost Transfer Module (CTM).
   A2.12.1. CPPM is a management tool to enhance cost and production ‘visibility’ within each
   ALC, so line and staff managers can view their current cost and production performance
   against targeted values.
   A2.12.2. BTM is an automated Organic CSAG budgeting tool that, when used in
   conjunction with the actual historical data captured in CPPM, permits multiple iterations of
   the budget/target development process.
A2.13. Funding Initiation Tool (FIT). FIT is a middle-ware tool that translates J025A and
G004L funding and Line of Accounting (LOA) information into the DIFMS elements of Funding
Document, Sponsor Order Number (SPON), and Customer Order Number (CON). FIT provides
an on-line, interactive tool that allows selected users to review, expand, and record customer
funding into DIFMS.
A2.14. Sales Price Generator (SPG). SPG allows the user to generate monthly and annual
frozen End Item Sales Prices (EISP).

RESEARCH AND CORRECTION OF COMMERCIAL MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS
  USING THE DIFMS REPORT 7310-322 “WEEKLY UNALLOCATED DETAILS”

A4.1. Check DIFMS record against GAFS/BL.
A4.2. Determine that it is a commercial material buy.
A4.3. Inquiring and transacting via the DIFMS Update Screen MS132P “Unallocated Detail
Error Correction Update” processes the cash transaction once corrected.
A4.4. Determine correct data elements needed – Contract number, Cost Code, ACRN, Task and
amount.
A4.5. Compare document number/contract number, ACRN, cost code and Task number on the
DIFMS Update Screen MS132P to the NIMMS Screen MN021P “Material Due”. These data
elements must match exactly.
A4.6. Correct the data elements on the NIMMS Screen MN021P and follow steps 1-5 above.
A4.7. If not in GAFS/BL, determine why, and follow steps 1 – 5 above.
A4.8. Cash action should clear when matching record is available. Note: Cash action would
have cleared cash process if Due and PON were recorded in NIMMS/DIFMS. A missing or
unequal receipt transaction, which is necessary for the transaction to clear, would happen in the
Unmatched Material reports. Working unmatched material using DIFMS Reports 7310-484
“Aged Unmatched Bills” and 7310-495 “Material Mismatched”: DIFMS Report 7310-484:
   A4.8.1. Check NIMMS record for Accounts Payable, on the DIFMS Inquiry Screen
   MS061P “Material Requisition Status”. The bill is listed.
   A4.8.2. Check the DIFMS record against GAFS/BL to ensure a valid receipt.
   A4.8.3. To process the receipt, access the NIMMS Screen MN113P “Purchase Receipts”.
   A4.8.4. Cash action processes match the receipt to the bill which then clears off of the
   DIFMS Report 7310-484. This is a weekly process.
       A4.8.4.1. DIFMS Report 7310-495:
           A4.8.4.1.1. Check NIMMS record for accounts payable and the receipt on the
           DIFMS Inquiry Screen MS061P. The Status code should be a ‘5’, which prevents the
           record to close out because of variance in the amounts.
           A4.8.4.1.2. Reverse out the incorrect NIMMS receipt on the NIMMS Screen
           MN031P and receipt the correct amount.
           A4.8.4.1.3. The daily cash action process now is able to process the transaction and
           clears off of the DIFMS Report 7310-495.
   A4.8.5. For problems with bill number:
       A4.8.5.1. DIFMS Update Screen MS189P “Material Requisition Number Correction”
       can be used to change the requisition number on a bill to another requisition number.
       Use of MS189P increases the Accounts Receivable balance on the new requisition

A11.1. The list of DIFMS General Ledger Accounts can be obtained from the link to the
USSGL website at http://www.fms.treas.gov/ussgl/index.html.
A11.2. New USSGL Account Number Code Structure. The new USSGL account number
code structure will include six digits and will be implemented by adding two zeros, “00,” to the
end of all USSGL account numbers. For example, USSGL account number 1010 will become
USSGL account number code 101000. Agencies must not modify these six-digit USSGL
account number codes. For agency-specific reporting needs, individual agencies may add a two-
digit USSGL account extension code that will not be standardized in the USSGL. Use of the
two-digit USSGL account extension code is at the discretion of the agency. By fiscal 2013,
agencies must provide Treasury central reporting data using the new USSGL account number
code structure. The change in the USSGL account number code structure applies throughout the
entire TFM. In fiscal 2012, the new USSGL account number codes will be published in the
TFM.
