dietitians to Personnel Administration chapter; also added Diet Counseling Authorization Guide
as an attachment to indicate diets that diet technicians can be certified on. Removed chapter
(chapter 4 in 2004 version) on Health Promotion Nutrition; this topic is thoroughly covered in
AFI 40-101 and the rewrite of AFI 40-104, which will be entitled Health Promotion Nutrition.
Terminology throughout the Nutrition Care chapter was updated and the use of the American
Dietetic Association (ADA) Nutrition Care Process (NCP) was added to include documentation
in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) using the Assessment, Diagnosis, Intervention,
Monitoring, Evaluation (A.D.I.M.E) format. Terminology and procedures in the Food
Production and Service chapter were updated to reflect the change from Nutrition Management
Information System (NMIS) to Computrition, a commercial off-the-shelf product. The changes
from NMIS to Computrition were also made in the Financial Management and Workload
Reporting chapter to include the use of an AF Accounting Spreadsheet to complete NM
accounting (no accounting module in Computrition). Wounded warrior meal procedures were
also added. An attachment was added to chapter on NM operations supported by Base Food
Service to show an example of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between NM and Services.
Consultant Services chapter was completely reorganized and rewritten to reflect the various
types/levels of NM consultants and their duties. Two attachments were obsolete and deleted and
two new attachments were added. Nutritional Medicine Subsistence Report Attachment was
modified to match the information required in AFI 41-120.

                       MISSION, VISION, AND ORGANIZATION

1.1. Mission and Vision. The mission of NM is to optimize health through nutrition. The NM
vision is to be the global leaders in nutrition, fueling performance.
1.2. Organization. If a separate NM Element/Flight/Squadron is feasible, then all NM
personnel are assigned to the NM unit under Functional Account Code (FAC) 5520 and matrixed
to the Health and Wellness Center (HAWC) as appropriate to complete health promotion
nutrition interventions, provide MNT when indicated, and to support the Air Force Fitness
Program. In clinics, the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) Commander decides the best location
in the organization for NM personnel. Two desirable locations include the Primary Care Clinic
or the HAWC (FAC 5315). Regardless of location, NM personnel will simultaneously provide
health promotion nutrition education programs, as well as complete referrals for MNT IAW AFI
44-102, Medical Care Management. Organizational structure for NM flights and elements is
more fully described in Chapter 3, Personnel Administration.
   1.2.1. In Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units, NM personnel may be assigned to the
   Medical Squadron or Aeromedical Staging Squadron (ASTS) where they may provide
   nutrition education programs and support the Air Force Fitness Program. AFRC NM
   personnel are also assigned to active duty NM units.

                                           Chapter 2

                               PLANNING AND EVALUATION

2.1. NM Management Plan. The purpose of long and short term planning is to ensure NM
operations and planning activities are aligned with strategic plans of the MTF, the command, the
Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) and the line of the Air Force. Individual NM management
plans should also be aligned with current, overall strategic plans for the career field.
Management planning provides NM an opportunity to establish instruction and policies that
focuses and allocates NM resources. Management planning should encompass both planning to
operate the current system, as well as planning efforts to make improvements. Management
planning sessions will include representation from airmen, civilians, contractors, NCOs, and
senior NM leaders. The NM Management Plan should be consistent with the MTF Mission
Support Plan, and outline management objectives, improvement efforts, and resources.
     2.1.1. Action Plans. Action plans are developed from NM goals and include specific
     information about activities or processes to be completed, personnel responsible, timeframes
     for completion and outcomes to be measured.
     2.1.2. Continuous communication with NM personnel and MTF senior leaders should take
     place throughout the planning process and implementation of the NM action plans.
     2.1.3. NM Management Plan Index. The purpose of the NM Management Plan Index is to
     organize important documents in one place for easy access and review. Each NM will
     maintain a department management plan which includes mission statements, organizational
     charts, AFMS and MTF strategic plan, departmental task analysis, goals and objectives, plan
     for the provision of patient care, scope of care, NM Medical Group Instruction, periodic
     taskings for NM personnel, annual in-service training plan, performance reports and
     feedback schedule, equipment replacement plan, budget, manpower information, monetary
     status information, appointment letters, NM meetings schedule, performance indicators,
     Consultant Dietitian reports and self-inspection information and any other facility specific
     information. The management plan index should be reviewed and updated, as needed, but at
     a minimum annually.
2.2. Self Inspections. New section chiefs (officer and enlisted) need to accomplish self-
inspections of their areas of oversight IAW AFI 44-119, Medical Quality Operations, which
specifies within 60 calendar days of assuming duty utilizing the mandated automated self-
inspection tool Medical Facility Assessment and Compliance Tracking System (MedFACTS) to
score all applicable elements of the current AD Health Services Inspection (HSI) guide.
Ambulatory MTFs will use the MedFACTS to score the applicable national patient safety goals
and current Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) standards.
     2.2.1. When an element or standard is in compliance, a brief statement to indicate evidence
     of compliance will be entered into MedFACTS. The statement should reference the location
     where further evidence of compliance can be viewed, such as shared drives, meeting minutes,
     or binders.
     2.2.2. When an element or standard is not in compliance, an action plan will be documented
     in MedFACTS and updated at least 60 days after the date the standard was determined non-
     compliant as well as regularly until the element or standard is in compliance.
AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011                                                                          7


   2.2.3. MedFACTS will contain the current and previous three years of self-inspection
   documentation. All other self-inspection documentation will be maintained in accordance
   with AFRIMS.
2.3. Performance Improvement (PI). Performance Improvement is a continuous activity that
involves measuring the function of important processes and services and when indicated,
identifies changes that enhance performance. These changes are incorporated into new and
existing processes, products, or services and are monitored to ensure improvements are
sustained. PI focuses on clinical, administrative and cost-of-care issues as well as patient
outcomes (results of care). The fundamental components of PI include staff education,
measuring performance through data collection, assessing current performance, utilizing the data
collected to improve organizational processes, services, and overall performance and re-
education. PI includes evaluating the following attributes: efficacy, appropriateness, availability,
timeliness, effectiveness, continuity, safety, efficiency, respect, and care.         Performance
measures should focus on critical processes in nutrition care, food production and management
of personnel and financial resources.
   2.3.1. PI activities, based on facility scope of practice and capability, are focused on high-
   risk, problem prone, high volume and high cost areas but are not limited to those areas.
       2.3.1.1. Examples of high-risk patient process include: patient tray food temperatures;
       nutrition clinic no-show rates; NPO/clear liquid tracking; nutrient-drug interaction
       counseling documentation; inpatient screening timeframes; and patient tray and menu
       accuracy.
       2.3.1.2. Examples of problem prone processes include: nutrition clinic no-show rates;
       kardex accuracy; absenteeism per time period; and number of work injuries per hours
       worked.
       2.3.1.3. Examples of high volume and high cost areas include: outcomes of MNT for
       management of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and weight control; cost per dining room meal;
       cost per patient meal; and cost per unit.
   2.3.2. NM will have Performance Improvement Teams consisting of a team leader,
   facilitator, recorder and team members as appropriate. Meeting minutes will be recorded and
   maintained.
2.4. Disaster and Contingency Planning. NM must have a plan that establishes
responsibilities and basic procedures for feeding patients and staff during both wartime and
peacetime contingency and disaster operations. This plan is an annex in the MTF's Medical
Contingency Response Plan (MCRP), typically known as Annex K. A local instruction must be
developed that addresses support of any alternate facilities, training, recall procedures, duty
schedules, communications, contingency menus, subsistence and supply procurement, food
preparation, equipment and supply requirements, disruption of utilities, water purification,
sanitation, and fire evacuation to include events with Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
Nuclear (CBRN) aspects. Key telephone numbers, copies of MCRP annexes, pre-planned menus
and any contingency checklists should be included. Consult the Expeditionary Medical Support
(EMEDS) Manual for additional information on disaster and contingency planning. NM disaster
and contingency plans should be reviewed and updated, as needed, annually.

2.5. Menu Planning. The Flight Commander/Element Chief is responsible for planning the
regular selective cycle and any special menus. The Chief, Clinical Dietetics is responsible for
writing the therapeutic menus. All regular and therapeutic menus will be approved by the NM
Flight Commander/Element Chief. At facilities with no dietitian assigned, regular and
therapeutic menus will be written by the NCOIC, NM and approved by the MAJCOM Dietitian.
     2.5.1. Cycle Menu Planning. Menu planning considerations should include subsistence
     ordering and delivery schedules, subsistence storage capacity, available equipment,
     subsistence budget, subsistence seasonal availability, personnel skills and abilities, seasonal
     and religious holidays, patron preferences, average inpatient length of stay, disease
     prevalence of patient population, patient age group considerations, cultural nutritional needs,
     type of inpatient food service operation and facility menu style (room service, a la carte,
     SCAMS, electronic menus, etc).
        2.5.1.1. All menus are designed to achieve or maintain optimal nutritional status.
        Regular/general menus will adhere to the Joint Subsistence Policy Board, Department of
        Defense menu Standards, which promote the United States Department of Agriculture
        (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS) Dietary Guidelines for
        Americans. Therapeutic menus will follow current recommendations for the MNT
        treatment of such acute and chronic disease states. Consult the ADA Nutrition Care
        Manual (NCM) and Pediatric Nutrition Care Manual (PNCM), Dietary Guidelines for
        Americans, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service’s Menu Magic for Children and/or
        other professional sources for additional information on planning healthy menus.
        2.5.1.2. Evaluate all menus for nutritional adequacy. At a minimum, assess compliance
        to Joint Subsistence Policy Board, Department of Defense Menu Standards and compare
        nutrient content to the USDA My Pyramid suggested servings for each food group.
        Computrition and/or other commercial nutrient analysis programs may be used for more
        detailed nutritional analysis as needed.
        2.5.1.3. Develop the therapeutic cycle menu using items from the regular menu and in
        the same sequence, as much as possible.
        2.5.1.4. Establish the type of inpatient food service operation as appropriate for the
        facility. Examples may include but are not limited to non-select menus, select menus,
        Burlodge buffet-style selection, hotel or room service, or any combination. Create a
        hospital master menu in a format most appropriate to easily transfer to the style of menu
        for the facility, i.e., AF Forms 1737 or 1739, Selective Menu, Hotel/Room Service menu,
        Computrition, etc. Reproduce menus as necessary.
        2.5.1.5. Develop standard daily/weekly rotations for nutritional supplements and
        food/snack items, as necessary, to ensure appropriate variety.
        2.5.1.6. At a minimum, update and modify menus annually.
        2.5.1.7. Develop a patient/customer feedback process to evaluate patient satisfaction
        with menu items and NM service. Results of patient satisfaction surveys and customer
        feedback can be valuable when updating and modifying menus and food production and
        service processes.

                                           Chapter 4

                                     NUTRITION CARE

4.1. Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT).
   4.1.1. MNT is the development and provision of specific nutrition procedures in the
   treatment of an illness or condition, or as a means to prevent or delay disease or
   complications from disease. MNT defines the level, content and frequency of nutrition
   services that are appropriate for optimal care and nutrition outcomes based on a detailed
   assessment of a person’s medical history, psychosocial history, physical examination, and
   dietary history.
   4.1.2. Evidence-Based Dietetics Practice and Standards. MNT is provided based on an
   integration of the best available and up-to-date scientific evidence, professional expertise and
   client values to improve outcomes. The ADA’s NCM and PNCM are the preferred source for
   evidence-based dietetics practice and patient education; however, other professional sources
   may include, but are not limited to, the ADA’s Evidence Analysis Library, Veteran’s
   Administration (VA)/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines, National Kidney Foundation,
   American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN), American Heart
   Association, American Diabetes Association, the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
   TRICARE Online, Medline Plus, Military One Source, and the U.S. National Library of
   Medicine.
      4.1.2.1. The NCM and PNCM are comprehensive online resources that cover all aspects
      of nutrition management, and each MTF is encouraged to purchase one or both manuals
      in the volume of subscriptions adequate for their facility. Prior to purchasing, coordinate
      with ADA and the local Information Technology (IT)/Systems department to ensure the
      MTF’s range of computer URLs can access the manual(s) at any one time up to the limit
      of subscriptions purchased and without a log-in/password requirement. Ensure the link to
      the NCM and/or PNCM are centrally located, i.e., Medical Group (MDG) Intranet, for all
      MTF personnel and providers to access, and market the availability and use of these
      resources.
      4.1.2.2. Reproducible patient education materials from sources other than those listed
      above or as a product of the MNT Working Group must be approved by the MAJCOM
      Consultant Dietitian in writing and coordinated through the MTF’s Patient Education
      Working Group or Population Health Committee, as applicable.
   4.1.3. Providing MNT. Credentialed RDs and/or authorized diet therapy personnel (under
   the supervision of a credentialed RD) provide MNT. MNT is an intrinsic part of clinical
   practice and at a minimum must be offered for patients with the following medical
   conditions: diabetes, pediatric failure to thrive, dyslipidemia, hypertension, malnutrition,
   high-risk pregnancy, renal disease, complicated inflammatory bowel disease, enteral
   nutrition, and parenteral nutrition.
      4.1.3.1. The scope of practice for HAWC nutrition specialists (e.g., health promotion
      dietitians and diet therapy craftsman) is to assess base population and environmental
      nutrition needs, plan, collaborate, implement and evaluate community nutrition strategies,
      interventions and programs and use multiple, evidence-based strategies and interventions
16                                                            AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011


     with the largest reach to impact population eating behaviors and outcomes. The primary
     target population is active duty.
     4.1.3.2. Registered dietitians and other providers such as physicians, dentists, certified
     nurse-midwives (CNM), physician assistants (PA), nurse practitioners, and pharmacists
     may provide MNT IAW their MTF clinical privileges and AFI 44-119.
     4.1.3.3. Diet therapy craftsmen provide MNT as authorized by AF Form 628 and can be
     authorized to provide MNT IAW Attachment 2, Diet Counseling Authorization Guide.
     Using this guide, the authorizing/credentialed RD determines what diets a diet therapy
     craftsman may be certified on based on their assessment of the diet therapy craftsman’s
     knowledge, ability, and skills. In addition, the authorizing/credentialed RD defines the
     diet therapy craftsman’s scope of practice and required level of supervision for each diet
     authorization.
     4.1.3.4. MNT for inpatients may be provided without consult based on the patient’s
     assessed nutrition risk per the MTF’s inpatient nutrition screening procedures. Medical
     staff can also consult for inpatient NM services using SF 513, Medical Record –
     Consultation Sheet, or electronic/MTF equivalent.
         4.1.3.4.1. Inpatient diet orders, to include nourishments and nutritional supplements,
         are ordered on AF Form 3066, Doctor’s Orders, or the electronic/MTF equivalent.
         Any non-standardized diet orders will be clarified by NM staff with the provider.
         Nursing service will ensure prompt delivery of inpatient MNT consultation requests
         and diet orders.
     4.1.3.5. MNT for outpatients is provided based on provider referral using SF 513 or
     electronic/MTF equivalent. Clients may also self-refer IAW MTF/Outpatient Nutrition
     Clinic guidance.
     4.1.3.6. The MTF Commander will consider options to ensure that all patients receive
     high quality nutrition services when the MTF does not have a RD or diet therapy
     personnel assigned. Possible options include hiring a full-time or part-time civilian RD,
     contracting for nutrition services, refer to RD or diet technician at the HAWC (if referral
     within their scope of practice/privileges/certifications), refer to off-base provider if
     benefit covered by TRICARE, or telemedicine when feasible. The MAJCOM Consultant
     Dietitian is also a resource for coordinating MNT.
  4.1.4. MNT Outcomes and Outcomes Management. MNT outcomes are a measureable,
  positive change in patients’ clinical, functional/behavioral, quality of life/satisfaction, or
  financial status as a direct result of MNT. Tracking and documenting MNT outcomes is
  important because: in managed care, medical services are reimbursable insurance benefits
  only if they produce positive outcomes in a cost-effective manner; it provides patients a
  reason for and an expected outcome by seeking nutritional services; and, outcomes prove the
  effectiveness of MNT.
     4.1.4.1. Each MTF will identify, prioritize and track MNT outcomes significant for their
     patient population and relevant to the AF and/or the MTF’s interdisciplinary teams, case
     managers, and disease and condition management programs. Committees such as the
     Integrated Delivery System (IDS), Population Health Working Group, and Environment
     of Care, may be resourceful avenues for tracking and marketing MNT outcomes.

4.2. Patient Rights and Privacy.
   4.2.1. All patients have the right to be informed about and participate in their nutrition care.
   Reasonable efforts should be made to ensure patients’ food preferences are noted, menus
   individualized, learning needs accommodated and special needs are met when applicable.
   NM personnel will comply with all privacy act guidance and instructions such as AFI 33-
   332, Air Force Privacy Act Program, and the Health Insurance Portability and
   Accountability Act (HIPPA).
4.3. Nutrition Screening.
   4.3.1. MTF/NM will develop a nutrition screening process to determine the nutritional risk
   for both inpatients and outpatients. Use an integrated, interdisciplinary approach whenever
   possible.
      4.3.1.1. MTF policies and operating instructions will detail both inpatient and outpatient
      populations to be screened, screening criteria and local processes and documentation
      techniques. MTF staff is educated on nutrition screening policies and procedures as
      applicable.
   4.3.2. The MNT Working Group is the career field point of contact for developing and
   maintaining standardized nutrition screening questionnaires for adults, pediatrics, and pre-
   /post-partum populations. With MAJCOM Consultant Dietitian approval, MTFs may deviate
   from standard screening questionnaires based on specific requirements of the MTF.
   Suggested references for use in developing the nutrition screening questionnaire include, but
   are not limited to, the current editions of: ADA Pocket Guide to Nutrition Assessment;
   ASPEN Nutrition Support Core Curriculum; CNM Nutrition Screening Practices in Health
   Care Organizations; and the International Dietetics & Nutrition Terminology (IDNT)
   Reference Manual.
   4.3.3. Inpatient nutrition screening is completed within 24 hours of admission to the MTF.
   At a minimum, adult inpatients are screened for the following criteria: involuntary weight
   loss to include time frame and amount; decreased appetite; special dietary needs; and food
   allergies.
      4.3.3.1. Patient preferences, allergies, nourishment requests, and other diet-related
      information are recorded in the patient Kardex on AF Form 1741, Diet Record, or
      electronic/MTF equivalent.
      4.3.3.2. Dietitians will initiate the Nutrition Care Process (NCP) for inpatients identified
      at moderate to high nutritional risk.
      4.3.3.3. Additional considerations for specific inpatient populations such as obstetrics or
      pediatrics are considered as appropriate.
      4.3.3.4. Pre-admission screening procedures are developed depending upon NM
      resources and facility needs.
   4.3.4. Outpatient clinics develop guidance and procedures to screen outpatient populations
   determined to be at high nutritional risk, i.e., oncology, prenatal, HIV, etc.
      4.3.4.1. Clinics refer outpatients to the Outpatient Nutrition Clinic or other nutrition care
      provider per local guidance.

4.4. Nutrition Care Process (NCP).
   4.4.1. MNT is provided using the ADA’s NCP and standardized terminology. The NCP is a
   systematic approach to providing high quality nutrition care and consists of four distinct and
   interrelated steps: nutrition assessment; diagnosis; intervention; and, monitoring/evaluation.
      4.4.1.1. RDs conduct and attend inpatient dietary patient rounds, medical patient rounds,
      nutrition support committee rounds, and discharge planning whenever possible. Pertinent
      patient data is recorded on AF Form 1741 or electronic/MTF-equivalent.
      4.4.1.2. Participation in such interdisciplinary, patient-centered activities enhances
      communication between care providers and allows the RD to obtain additional patient
      information for assessments and re-assessments, menu selection assistance, information
      regarding food preferences or intolerances, food allergies, educational needs, etc. In
      addition, nutrition needs after discharge can be coordinated as needed.
   4.4.2. MNT is documented in the outpatient electronic health record (EHR), AHLTA, the
   inpatient EHR, Essentris, or other MTF equivalent using the Assessment, Diagnosis,
   Intervention, Monitoring, Evaluation (A.D.I.M.E.) format, as applicable.
      4.4.2.1. Additional hard-copy document forms include SF 513, SF 509, Medical Record
      Progress Note, and SF 600, Chronological Record of Medical Care.

   4.4.3. Assessment data is found on the following forms or electronic/MTF equivalent: AF
   Form 2572, Nutritional Assessment of Dietary Intake; AF Form 2508, Calorie Count; DD
   Form 792, Twenty-four Hour Patient Intake and Output Worksheet; and AF Form 3067,
   Intravenous Record.
   4.4.4. Nutrition Diagnoses are written in the Problem-Etiology-Signs/Symptoms (PES)
   format.
      4.4.4.1. When applicable, prioritize the Nutrition Diagnosis by selecting terminology
      from the Intake domain first.
      4.4.4.2. All nutrition diagnoses are carried forward to follow-up assessments until
      diagnosis has resolved.
      4.4.4.3. If a patient does not have a nutrition problem at the time of assessment, the
      statement ―No nutritional diagnosis at this time‖ will be written and Monitoring and
      Evaluation (follow-up) determined based on the patient’s status.

AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011                                                                      25


      4.13.5.1. Additional hard-copy document forms include SF 513, SF 509, and SF 600.
   4.13.6. Nutrition education and MNT for patients/families commonly offered should be
   IAW 44-102 and/or based on the needs of the MTF/base patient population and NM staffing
   and resources.
   4.13.7. NM/MTF will develop operating guidance for an outpatient nutrition clinic to
   include patient referral, scheduling, class preparation, patient/family check-in procedures,
   lesson plans, education evaluation tools, communication with other health care professionals,
   and documentation.
4.14. Health Promotion Nutrition
   4.14.1. Nutrition plays an important role in the AF Health Promotion Program (HPP).
   Dietitians and diet technicians should be aware of and, as much as feasible/possible, involved
   in nutrition strategies across the Intervention Pyramid. Nutrition and health promotion is
   completely addressed in AFI 40-101 and AFI 40-104. Refer to those AFI’s for all nutrition
   and health promotion information.

                                          Chapter 5

                           FOOD PRODUCTION AND SERVICE

5.1. Production Planning
   5.1.1. (Automated) Production Planning. In 2009, the legacy government off-the-shelf
   product, Nutritional Management Information System (NMIS), was replaced with a
   commercial off-the-shelf product, Computrition. As a result of this change in information
   management software, NM personnel will utilize Computrition to automate their production
   planning processes IAW the current instructions outlined in the Computrition Training &
   Reference Guide, Food Operations Management (FOM) User’s Reference Guide.
      5.1.1.1. Menu Maintenance.
          5.1.1.1.1. All meal changes and assignment of meals to cycle days is performed
          under the Menu Maintenance function in Computrition.
          5.1.1.1.2. All recipes and food items are verified as being on the menu either by
          crosschecking the screen or by using the View at Glance Report.
          5.1.1.1.3. Once the recipes and food items are verified, run the Menu Item Cost
          Report. This report must be run at least monthly, however, running the report weekly
          to update the food costs in the system is recommended.
          5.1.1.1.4. Next, run the Recipe Price Report to obtain the updated costs. Note: The
          Menu Cost Report MUST be run PRIOR TO running the Recipe Price Report.
      5.1.1.2. Forecasting.
          5.1.1.2.1. Forecasting is available when the menu is corrected and verified.
          5.1.1.2.2. Forecast only for those items that the produced quantity needs to be
          controlled. Items like PC condiments, fountain soda, fresh fruit and other similar
          items do not need to be forecasted.
          5.1.1.2.3. The Menu Maintenance function of Computrition is where the site
          manager identifies what courses are to be forecasted (soup, entree, vegetable, etc.).
          5.1.1.2.4. In Computrition go to Menus Post Meal Count function and enter the
          number of meals served into the actual count fields. Click calculated prepared button,
          this will automatically populate amounts in the Prepared field. There are three
          options for forecasting to choose from: 1. Do not apply batching, Forecast equals
          Prepared (selected by default). This option sets all prepared amounts to forecasts
          amounts. 2. Batch (each menu meal separately). Check this option if you want
          batching included for Prepared amounts. 3. Overwrite existing prepared figures.
          Check this option to overwrite any numbers that have been entered in the Prepared
          fields. Once you have chosen an option click in the Served field of each recipe and
          type the amounts served. When amounts are placed in this field, figures are
          automatically entered into the Leftover and Next Time fields. The Percent Count
          field is active if the Served amount is less than the Prepared amount. Click the
          Review Counts button to show counts and have the ability to copy them forward to
AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011                                                                        27


          the next time the menu is served. A number must be in the Served and Next Time
          fields of each recipe in order for counts to be copy forward.
      5.1.1.3. Calculate Yield Adjust. Using the post meal count function of Computrition to
      forecast must be done at least five days out from the day that the user would like to yield
      adjust. This is necessary for the pulling of food items three days prior to use (early
      withdrawal; frozen meats, etc.) and prepping of items two days prior to actual meal
      service (pre-preparation; gelatins, etc.).
      5.1.1.4. Run Production Reports. Once the Post Meal Counts have been completed and
      copied forward run the Production Worksheet Report. This report provides a list of
      recipes and amounts required for producing the selected menus and meals for the selected
      dates. Also, print the Menu Scaled Recipes Report this will print recipes for the date and
      meal selected scaled to the amount required in the menus.
   5.1.2. (Manual) Production Planning. The Production Worksheet Report (Computrition) is
   normally used to perform production planning. If Computrition or computer systems are
   down, temporarily perform manual production planning (forecast food production needs for
   the meals in the cycle menu, establish a food use monitoring system, and communicate
   instructions to food production personnel in the planning, preparing, cooking and serving of
   meals) according to local procedures. Facilities with inpatient feeding only, should establish
   an alternate method of creating an audit trail for food use, AF Form 543, Food Issue Record,
   menus and tally sheets. If the NM cash register does not have the capability of inputting
   patient meal counts, menu items served to patients and the total number of servings provided
   to patients must be documented according to local procedures. The tally sheet for patient
   meals and late trays, to include therapeutic menus, should also be tracked/recorded according
   to local procedures. be attached to this manual report/log.
5.2. Purchasing Non-Food Supplies
   5.2.1. Items for Patient Tray Service. Establish local operating procedures to request and
   purchase nonfood supplies needed for patient tray service, dining room operations, food
   production, and sanitation. These procedures must reflect types of items needed, amounts
   used, replacement factors, stock levels, and delivery times. Prepackaged flatware sets and
   dining packets containing straw, napkin and condiments (sugar, salt, pepper and sugar
   substitute) are allowed and are requested from Medical Logistics as supply items.
   5.2.2. Enteral Formulas and other Medical Foods, and Infant Formulas. See Chapter 4,
   Section 4.10 for information on purchasing these items.
5.3. Food Portion and Waste Control
   5.3.1. Standardized recipes, serving utensils, and dishes are used to control portions, quality,
   and cost of food served. Foods should be cooked progressively, in small amounts as needed
   to help ensure a fresher, more acceptable product. This practice also results in less waste by
   cooking only what is needed as it is needed. NM production managers should periodically
   observe plate waste in the dish room from dining room service and patient trays. This helps
   in discovering and solving problems related to food quality, taste, portion control, quantity
   prepared and acceptability.
 28                                                             AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011


5.4. Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP). HACCP is the prevention-based
food service safety system that must be used in NM. HACCP systems are designed to prevent
the occurrence of potential food safety problems. HACCP involves seven principles.
   5.4.1. Analyze hazards. Potential food-related hazards and measures to control potential
   hazards are identified. The hazard could be biological, such as a microbe; chemical, such as a
   toxin; or physical, such as ground glass or metal fragments.
   5.4.2. Identify critical control points. These are points in a food's production, from its raw
   state through processing and shipping to consumption by the consumer, at which the
   potential hazard can be controlled or eliminated. Examples are cooking, cooling, and
   packaging.
   5.4.3. Establish preventive measures with critical limits for each control point. For example,
   for a cooked food this might include setting the minimum cooking temperature and time
   required to ensure the elimination of any harmful microbes.
   5.4.4. Establish procedures to monitor the critical control points. Such procedures might
   include determining how and by whom cooking time and temperature should be monitored.
   5.4.5. Establish corrective actions to take when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not
   been met. For example, reprocessing or disposing of food if the minimum cooking
   temperature is not met.
   5.4.6. Establish procedures to verify that the system is working properly--for example,
   testing time-and-temperature recording devices to verify that a cooking unit is working
   properly.
   5.4.7. Establish effective record keeping to document the HACCP system. This would
   include records of hazards and their control methods, the monitoring of safety requirements
   and action taken to correct potential problems.
   5.4.8. Food Temperatures. NM personnel complete AF Form 2582, Food Temperature
   Chart, or local equivalent, before and during each meal to ensure foods are served at
   appropriate temperatures IAW the FDA Food Code. Foods at other than optimal
   temperatures must be reheated or chilled as appropriate.
   5.4.9. Storing Subsistence Items. Subsistence storage rooms and refrigerators/freezers
   MUST remain locked at all times when not in use. Entry for all but authorized personnel
   must be prohibited. NM refrigerators should have the following: an accurate thermometer
   inside the unit which can be viewed from outside the refrigerator/freezer, a temperature chart
   to record readings taken at specific times IAW local guidance unless centrally monitored by
   Facilities Management, a warning sign such as ―Determine No One is Inside Before
   Locking,‖ a safety lock release that lets the door open from inside when externally locked, an
   electric light preferably mounted overhead with a glass-dome bulb protector and a grid-type
   metal cover, and lastly a sign indicating the type of food(s) stored within and the required
   temperature range IAW the FDA Food Code.
5.5. Sanitation and Infection Control. Refer to AFI 48-116, the current Air Force edition of
the FDA Food Code, and AFI 44-108 for NM sanitation and infection control policies. Limit
access to food preparation and service areas by unauthorized personnel. NM personnel
AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011                                                                       29


performing dishwashing duties must always wear gloves as a protective device against possible
infections or contamination.
5.6. Patient Tray Assembly. Patient trays are assembled using a centralized food service,
which places all food service workers under the supervision of the NM officer or diet therapy
supervisor. Using the right patient tray service system aids in the appropriate use of employees
assigned. The size of the medical treatment facility determines the type of patient tray assembly
system used.
   5.6.1. Heated Base With Enclosed Pellet System. Larger MTFs use the heated base with
   enclosed pellet system. This system can also be used to augment the hot and cold cart system
   used in smaller facilities, if the tray carts cannot maintain a high enough temperature for hot
   foods.
   5.6.2. Hot and Cold Tray Cart System. The hot and cold tray cart systems are typically used
   at smaller facilities due to reduced labor requirements. One person can prepare all trays and
   additional personnel are needed only to deliver trays to patient inpatient units. If an MTF's
   number of operational beds would normally dictate using a hot/cold food cart system, but the
   contingency plan calls for an expansion capacity making the heated base with pellet system
   desirable, retain and use the heated base with enclosed pellets system and conveyor belt.
   5.6.3. Insulated Stacking Trays System. The Insulated Stacking Tray System is generally
   used at small facilities that are supported by base food service.

                                            Chapter 6

            FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND WORKLOAD REPORTING

6.1. Prime Vendor. Prime Vendor is a concept of support whereby a single commercial
distributor serves as the major provider of products to various federal customers within a
geographical region or zone. The vendor supplies commercially available subsistence items
under a contractual agreement established by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) or
Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA).
   6.1.1. NM personnel must have a thorough knowledge of their Prime Vendor contract,
   especially renewal timeframes. Prime Vendor contracts are developed by DSCP in a number
   of steps called the acquisition process. NM communication throughout this process for
   generating new or renewing existing contracts is essential to make sure specific NM
   subsistence purchasing needs are met. Further information on establishing Prime Vendor
   contracts can be found in the DSCP Prime Vendor Manual available on the DSCP website.
       6.1.2. NM must communicate to DSCP specific subsistence needs such as low-fat dairy
       products, special bread items, ice cream novelties and any dietetic items (low sodium,
       low-fat, sugar-free). NM must detail what is unique to its operation and the support
       needed. Any special requests or unusually large orders must be communicated to the
       vendor. Problems with vendors should be reported to DSCP for resolution, after
       reasonable attempts to arrive at settlement have occurred with the vendor.
       Communication in writing with DSCP on vendor’s performance, both good and bad, is
       essential in determining continuing contracts or future awards. Vendors must
       communicate with NM and DSCP representatives during all phases of the contract award
       process. It is the prime vendor’s responsibility to communicate his terms not only to
       DSCP but also to NM. The Contractor Representative must be accessible to NM and the
       vendor’s customer service must be available and easily reached by phone. Vendor
       communication and the level of service should be the same with government customers
       as it is with all others. DSCP is responsible for explaining the contract and identifying the
       customer’s requirements. DSCP is responsible for communications with all parties during
       the acquisition process. DSCP must act as the customers’ advocate in communicating
       with the vendors and must require vendors to adhere to the conditions and terms of the
       contract.
6.2. Financial Accountability. The duties of personnel purchasing subsistence will be
separated from the duties of personnel completing ration accounting so that no one individual is
responsible for both originating data (source records) and inputting/processing data. Therefore,
individuals who issue food will not be authorized to close, verify or issue/return documents to
the official inventory.
6.3. Subsistence Purchasing. NM will purchase subsistence through DSCP or DVA prime
vendor contracts and local direct delivery contracts. Small facilities with limited NM operations
may use Government Purchase Card (GPC) accounts to purchase subsistence items needed for
patient feeding. The cost of food purchased is charged to the medical sub-account of 04(X),
Essential Station Messing (ESM), Military Personnel Appropriation. (Example: 5703500 320 48
562 525725). The correct ESM accounting classification number is updated annually and is
AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011                                                                        31


effective 1 October. A letter from the Air Force Services Agency (AFSVA), coordinated through
the AF SG Chief Consultant/BSC Associate Chief for Dietetics, and distributed to MAJCOMs
and MTFs indicates the updated ESM account classification number.
   6.3.1. Subsistence orders are submitted according to locally established procedures.
   6.3.2. Subsistence acceptance authority is assigned to NM. NM must designate individuals
   authorized to accept or reject subsistence or supplies delivered under prime vendor programs
   or other DSCP contracts.
       6.3.2.1. Designated personnel should verify the hard copy purchase order with the
       vendor invoice from the driver. Ensure that products received match those ordered at time
       of receipt so that the vendor’s delivery ticket may be annotated with any discrepancies.
       When discrepancies are detected upon receipt, the vendor’s invoice will be annotated to
       indicate actual quantities received by striking through the listed quantity and entering the
       received quantity and reasons for the differences (i.e., damaged, short quantity, missing,
       substitution, high temperature, etc.). If the vendor substitutes more expensive food items,
       NM personnel should follow procedures outlined in the prime vendor contract for
       resolution. The individual making the change should initial all corrections to the
       distributor’s invoice. The carrier’s representative should sign the invoice when such
       corrections are made. Any invoice changes must be verified with prime vendor. When
       discrepancies are detected after receipt confirmation, NM personnel should phone the
       distributor’s customer representative to request a one for one replacement for the
       discrepant quantity.
          6.3.2.1.1. Invoices must reflect only items/quantities accepted and signed for by the
          NM receiving official.
          6.3.2.1.2. Check each function in the billing chain: NM storeroom personnel, DSCP
          or VA Account Manager and Contract Specialist, and Prime Vendor Billing
          Department, to make sure all codes, and billing/accounting information is correct.
              6.3.2.1.2.1. Billing errors can result from many causes: invalid Department of
              Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC), incorrect Military Standard
              Requisitioning and Issue Procedure (MILSTRIP) profile, TAC 3 billing address,
              and/or ESM accounting classification.
              6.3.2.1.2.2. The DODAAC is the unique code that identifies the NM activity. All
              NM activities must have a DODAAC beginning with ―FT‖ and followed by a
              four-digit number. Codes with other two-letter prefixes, such as ―FB‖ or ―FM‖ are
              incorrect. Questions or concerns about this code should be referred to the
              appropriate MAJCOM Functional Manager or Consultant Dietitian.
              6.3.2.1.2.3. MILSTRIP PROFILES are the ―ship to‖ address for delivering food.
              The NM MILSTRIP profile must be current in the DSCP system for proper
              billing and payment.
   6.3.3. The subsistence GPC card in NM activities will be used for the purchase of
   subsistence items only. This card is not authorized for any other purchases. Items other than
   subsistence to support the preparation or serving of foods may not be purchased with this
   card. The government purchase card can only be used to purchase items from DeCA for
 32                                                            AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011


   emergency purposes. The GPC cannot be used to purchase subsistence from any other local
   sources unless approved by HQ AFSVA/SVOHF with coordination with SAF/FMP.
       6.3.3.1. Contact the base contracting office and request the GPC Procurement Program
       Cardholder and Approving Official Account Set-Up Information application forms. Each
       cardholder and each approving official must complete an application form. For address,
       use the duty section address. Submit a letter of request for GPC card listing all
       individuals responsible for subsistence procurement. Identify the primary approving
       official as well as all designated alternates. All cardholders will receive monthly
       statements of their account activity. The approving officials can view a monthly summary
       statement on line.
       6.3.3.2. Each cardholder must maintain a GPC account documentation binder IAW AFI
       64-117, Air Force Government-Wide Purchase Card Program.
6.4. Unauthorized Uses of Subsistence Items. MTF staff and visitors are not authorized to
consume unused trays, leftover food, or nourishments on inpatient care units. Food items
purchased for use by NM activities will not be issued or given to the Pharmacy or nursing
service for making medications or coloring tube feedings. Pharmacy, nursing service and any
other departments may purchase necessary subsistence items, such as sugar, baking soda,
cornstarch, or food coloring from DeCA or other vendors via their own GPC accounts. Nonfood
items such as charcoal and lighter fluid for NM theme meals should be purchased with NM
supply funds. Subsistence funds and food items purchased with subsistence funds are not used
for guest meals, snacks, coffee breaks, cooking demonstrations, parties of any type, blood donor
or health promotion programs. Food items for Health Promotion activities are purchased via
separate Health Promotion GPC accounts. If food items for blood donor or health promotion
programs are purchased by other departments and are stored in NM, they will not be posted or
included in the NM subsistence inventory, or physically located with other subsistence. These
items will be controlled, specially marked, and used only in support of the programs for which
they were purchased.
6.5. Perpetual Inventory. The Storeroom Manager is responsible for keeping the perpetual
inventory system of subsistence stock records, source documents for subsistence purchases and
issues. Entries include vendor receipts and purchase invoices, GPC statements and receipts, or
AF Forms 543, Food Issue Record.
   6.5.1. (Automated) . Access the Computrition online user manual for appropriate
   procedures by pressing F1 while logged into Computrition.
   6.5.2. (Manual) . AF Form 542, Subsistence Stock Record, is used to maintain a perpetual
   inventory of all food items in the storeroom.
6.6. Physical Inventory.
   6.6.1. A physical inventory is performed each month (except September) on one of the last
   three normal duty days and is representative as of the date of the inventory (with the
   exception of FY close-out). Pre-pulled subsistence to be used for the weekend through the
   last calendar day must be issued on the actual day used. Any inventory adjustment is to be
   posted to AF Form 546, Food Cost Record, as of the date of inventory. Post the remaining
   days of the month and close out the AF Form 546 on the last day of the month. The FY
   close-out in September should be conducted on the last day of the fiscal year when possible;
AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011                                                                       33


  otherwise, it is taken on the last duty day and the above procedures followed for closing out
  the account.
  6.6.2. The MTF Commander appoints a disinterested person (officer or noncommissioned
  officer in grades E-7 or above) to perform a physical inventory of all food items. The
  inventory officer must be trained on their responsibilities and inventory procedures. This
  training should include directions on using the wall-to-wall inventory method (shelf-by-shelf,
  top to bottom) to count and record the total quantity of each item on hand. A NM
  representative assists the inventory officer. The storeroom is closed and no food issues made
  until the inventory is completed. Any food issues made after the inventory are dated for the
  following day. A physical count is taken of each unissued food item on the inventory listing
  obtained from Computrition. The inventory officer delivers the completed and signed
  inventory listing to the MSA Officer and NM Officer/NCOIC.
  6.6.3. Inventory Certification. After the inventory is done, the inventory officer and NM
  inventory representative sign the following statement on the last page of the inventory listing:
  "I certify this physical count of inventory is correct."
  6.6.4. If the physical count and the inventory records do not agree, attempt to recount the
  item(s) and reconcile the differences using purchase invoices, issue logs, GPC receipts,
  and/or Computrition reports. When differences cannot be reconciled, an Inventory
  Adjustment Report is prepared.
     6.6.4.1. Inventory Adjustment Report. When approved, this report is a valid accounting
     document used to adjust discrepancies found during a regularly scheduled inventory. NM
     will keep a copy of the approved report.
         6.6.4.1.1. The MSA officer/NM Accountant prepares the Inventory Adjustment
         Report from the costed inventory listing to show actual overages and shortages by
         item and the net total monetary adjustment. It must also show the total value of all
         subsistence issued since the last inventory and the value of one half of one percent
         (0.005) of that total. NM Storeroom personnel are not authorized to prepare this
         report.
         6.6.4.1.2. NM submits the report to the squadron commander, who is authorized to
         approve net dollar discrepancies of not more than one-half of one percent (0.005) of
         the total dollar value of food used since the last inventory. Food items that are not
         approved for adjustment by the squadron commander as well as losses or damages
         due to other than normal NM operations (fire or theft) have a Report of Survey action
         done.
  6.6.5. Inventory Control. At the end of each quarter and the fiscal year, the dollar value of
  the closing inventory, as reported on AF Form 541, Nutritional Medicine Service Subsistence
  Cost Report, will be between 15 and 30 percent of the cumulative average monthly cost of
  food used for the fiscal year to date. MTFs using Prime Vendor for subsistence will reduce
  inventory levels to 2-3 days’ supply, or not more than 15 to 30 percent of the cumulative
  average monthly cost of food used for the fiscal year to date. Optimal inventory levels must
  be determined locally to ensure that adequate food is on hand/available in case of disaster or
  emergency situations when deliveries are likely to be disrupted.
 34                                                               AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011


6.7. Closing a NM Activity. At least four months prior to closing, start dropping the inventory
level to below the 25 percent level. Adapt menus to use food in stock instead of purchasing more
food. Gradually drop the inventory level so that two months prior to closure, the inventory level
is approximately 15 percent. At closure, transfer the last bit of inventory to other base dining
facilities. Follow the guidance established by the base closure committee for the disposition of
equipment and supplies.
6.8. Issuing Subsistence.
   6.8.1. (Automated) Items are issued in Computrition Access the Computrition online user
   manual for appropriate procedures by pressing F1 while logged into Computrition.
   6.8.2. (Manual) AF Form 543 is used to issue food supplies manually. Once able to access
   Computrition transcribe all information. AF Form 543 is a source document used by the
   MSA officer/NM storeroom personnel to maintain the official perpetual inventory of food
   items. Storeroom personnel complete AF Form 543 for each day of the week and issue direct
   delivery items on the day they are received. Perishable fresh fruits and vegetables may be
   issued the day of purchase and receipt. High volume, low-cost items may be issued as
   needed each day, or for a longer use period. Food items being issued should be listed by
   food groups or some other internal order on the form to expedite issuing, posting, pricing,
   and receiving.
       6.8.2.1. The person receiving the food items from the storeroom counts and verifies food
       received and signs the form tin the ―received‖ block. If more food items are issued than
       needed, return to inventory under ―returned‖ column of form.
       6.8.2.2. No later than the day following issue of food, post issues to AF Form 542
       writing the balance of the item issued in column 1 as the item is posted, and the signed
       forms are reviewed and checked by NM management. MSA office gets original and a
       copy; NM keeps a copy.
       6.8.2.3. The MSA office cost-extends the two copies of AF Form 543 marking column 2
       of the form as each item is posted. One copy of the cost-extended form is returned to
       NM for review and filing.
       6.8.2.4. The MSA office retains on file the original cost-extended form and returns the
       duplicate to NM for filing. NM retains the file for three years for audit purposes.
6.9. Costing Subsistence Items. All MTFs use the Last-In First-Out (LIFO) costing method for
recording purchases and costing items. With this method, the value of the inventory is based on
the last purchase price of each line item and as food items are purchased, the new unit price, if
applicable, is used to re-value the entire balance of that line item in the inventory. This practice
is designed into the automated system.
6.10. Excess Cost. Excess Costs are feeding costs that exceed the monetary allowance
authorized for individual food components or needs. Examples of situations where
reimbursements are authorized include: use of operational rations (the cost of the operational
ration that exceeds actual earnings), substituted food items, unsatisfactory subsistence (spoilage
upon delivery), beverages for medical readiness exercises, and lost meals due to disaster or
exercise situations. These credits are not added to earnings, but rather subtracted from issues.
The resulting dollar amount, Food Served, is used to calculate monetary status. Monetary credit
AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011                                                                          35


is taken and annotated on the AF Accounting Spreadsheet in the excess cost column; this is
calculated into the earnings minus issues. The dollar value of issues will not reflect any costs that
were credited.
   6.10.1. The NM officer or diet therapy supervisor prepares a statement to support the other
   income (credit), including the date and hour of the disaster, combat mission or field, alert or
   medical readiness exercise. Certification of this statement is required by the MTF
   Commander.
6.11. Cashier Operations. Separation of financial duties and responsibilities in authorizing,
processing, recording and receiving cash transactions is essential to prevent loss of funds. NM
must develop a local instruction to detail how cashiering and accounting duties are separated so
as to establish adequate internal controls to prevent theft and abuse.
   6.11.1. Change Fund. DoD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Vol 5, Disbursing
   Policy and Procedures, Chapter 3, Keeping and Safeguarding Public Funds, authorizes and
   states how the NM Officer requests a change fund.
   6.11.2. Cash Control. For A la Carte (ALACS) operations, a cash control supervisor must be
   designated in writing. An adequate funds storage safe must be available to hold the change
   fund, cash sales, and guarded forms..
       6.11.2.1. AF Form 2570, Nutritional Medicine Service Cash and Forms Receipt, is used
       to issue the cash drawer, and AF IMT 79, Headcount Record, to the cashier as required.
       The same AF Form 2570 is used by the cashier to return the cash drawer, cash collected,
       and AF IMT 79 to the cash control officer after the meal. Discrepancies are also noted on
       AF IMT 79.
   6.11.3. Control of signature and cash collection forms and cash. The cash control supervisor
   indicates funds and guarded forms (AF IMT 79) for turn in to MSA using AF Form 1305,
   Receipt for Transfer of Cash and Vouchers, for cash collected and AF Form 1254, Register
   of Cash Collection Sheets, for guarded forms used to document the transfer of responsibility
   from NM to MSA.
       6.11.3.1. The AF IMT 79 is a guarded form used to obtain the signatures of all persons
       who eat in NM dining facilities at government expense (i.e., ESM), except inpatients.
       The AF IMT 79 is also used to collect and record all funds of cash paying customers.
       The designated NM representative (must be a government employee) keeps a separate
       file of completed AF IMT 79 forms in numerical order by serial number. This file must
       be physically checked at least once each month to see that all forms are accounted for by
       number. No two AF IMT 79 forms bear the same number in the same fiscal year. All
       numbered and unused forms must be kept in a locked safe. The MSA clerk furnishes the
       NM representative as many numbered AF IMT 79 forms as may be required. The AF
       IMT 79 forms issued to NM are recorded on AF Form 1254. Completed AF IMT 79
       forms are turned in by the NM cash control supervisor by listing the serial numbers on
       the same AF Form 1305 used to turn in AF IMT 79 forms and cash to MSA.
   6.11.4. Cash and Forms turn in to MSA. All cash collected and AF IMT 79 forms used must
   be turned in to the MSA office daily, excluding weekends. However, if the storage limit on
   the safe/funds storage container is inadequate to support the amount of cash collected over a
   2 or 3 day weekend, make arrangements with the MSA office to turn in excess cash to the
36                                                             AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011


  MSA office during the weekend period, or request an increase, through Finance, in the
  amount of funds the safe/funds storage container can store.
     6.11.4.1. Cash deposit paperwork (AF Form 544, Nutritional Medicine Daily Facility
     Summary Report, AF Form 1305, and AF Form 2570) must be done on a daily basis,
     even if the money must be held over the weekend.
  6.11.5. ALACS Cash Register Operations. Cash registers are used with the capacity to
  identify ESM diners by their entire social security number; record meal charges; produce
  daily cumulative reports of total charges to each social security number; calculate discount
  and full meal prices; receive cash; record diner head count by category, including transient
  patients, inpatients eating in the dining room, and second servings from ESM customers;
  produce both patient and dining room food consumption reports; and record totals for Food
  Service Operating Expenses collected. Care must be taken that the cash registers are correctly
  programmed to both calculate and charge cash patrons the DoD-directed surcharge and
  correctly total the surcharges from each meal period.
     6.11.5.1. The DoD subsistence surcharge (operating expense) is proportionately divided
     between the AF Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) and the Defense Health
     Program (DHP) O&M appropriation based on the percentage of the MTF dining hall’s
     military and civilian manpower authorizations (per the Unit Manning Document). MTF
     military personnel are funded by the AF MPA and civilians are funded by the DHP O&M
     appropriation. MTF MSA officers will proportionately divide the surcharge accordingly
     with the start of each FY. For example, if the FY surcharge collected is $100 and the
     MTF dining hall manpower authorizations are three military and seven civilian personnel,
     then the proportionate amount to deposit to MPA is $30 and the amount to deposit to the
     DHP O&M is $70 (e.g., out of 10 employees, 30 percent are military and 70 percent are
     civilian, therefore $100 would be divided respectively).
     6.11.5.2. Cash register maintenance contracts are established and adequate supplies of
     tapes and ribbons are procured locally through Medical Logistics.
     6.11.5.3. Cashiers must offer all customers a receipt for their purchases.
  6.11.6. Subsistence Credit Allowance Management System (SCAMS) Cashier Operations.
  In SCAMS operations, all diners in a government dining facility, except ambulatory and
  transient patients, sign for meals. The cashier verifies the diner's identification. Customers
  pay for meals in according to local guidance. In overseas areas, authorized medical facility
  local national employees will pay for meals according to the Status of Forces Agreement
  (SOFA) for that country. Local disaster plans may address use of personal checks and/or lost
  meals due to disaster situations.
     6.11.6.1. All non-ESM persons entering the dining room must pay the posted price of the
     meal being served, regardless of the type of meal items or quantity selected. Some small
     volume feeding overseas facilities do not have cash registers and use the AF IMT 79,
     Headcount Record, to record patron meals.
     6.11.6.2. The cashier(s) ensure(s) the AF IMT 79 forms are completed daily for each
     meal period. A separate AF IMT 79 is used for non-U.S. citizen civilian employees
     overseas who are allowed to eat in the dining room. Use a separate AF IMT 79 for
     breakfast, lunch, and dinner. These forms will not be "carried over" from one meal to
AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011                                                                          37


       another. Therefore, in facilities where an authorized change fund is allotted for both
       dollars and the local currency, three AF IMT 79 forms are issued per meal (one for meal
       card holders, one for dollars, and one for local currency).
       6.11.6.3. Air Force Reserve members must present verification of eligibility for ESM
       meals (reserve active duty orders or AF Form 40a, Record of Individual Inactive Duty
       Training) while on active duty training or inactive duty for training, sign AF IMT 79 as
       required, and write their names and social security numbers legibly on the forms.
       6.11.6.4. After the meal, the NM supervisor verifies entries on the AF IMT 79 signs the
       form, and then transfer the number of meals for each different category onto the
       appropriate entries in the AF Accounting Spreadsheet (Automated) and/or on AF Form
       544 (Manual).
       6.11.6.5. When the amount of cash collected varies from the number of signatures and
       total amount due, the supervisor investigates and states the explanation for overages or
       shortages. Include the name(s) of the cashier(s) during the meal. If no reason for the cash
       variance is apparent, state that there is no apparent reason for the cash variance.
       6.11.6.6. The completed AF IMT 79 forms and collected cash are delivered to the MSA
       officer at least once each normal duty day. The MSA officer will, upon receipt of
       completed AF IMT 79 forms, and the cash from the NM cash control supervisor, verify
       the cash receipts against the total amount of cash received.
       6.11.6.7. Small volume feeding facilities will use the Computrition system to track
       inventory, as well as all purchases and requisitions. The AF Accounting Spreadsheet
       (automated) is used to record daily earnings, issues, and purchases, as well as all relevant
       patient feeding activities (APV/SDS) and patient bed days.
           6.11.6.7.1. In the event the computer systems were down for an extended period of
           time. The SCAMS facility would utilize standardized AF Form processes (i.e., AF
           Form 542, AF Form 543, AF Form 544, and AF Form 541) to track earnings and
           issues until appropriate entries could be made in the AF Accounting Spreadsheet or
           Computrition once automated operations resumed.
6.12. Eligibility and Identification of Diners. DOD 1338.10-M, Manual for the Department of
Defense Food Service Program, AFI 41-115, Authorized Health Care and Health Care Benefits
in the Military Health Services System, and AFH 41-114, Military Health Services System
Matrix, state who is eligible for medical care in AF medical facilities, prescribe the extent of care
allowed, provide guidance for care, and delineate who pays full and discount meal rates (see
Attachment 3). Meal rates are published annually in a message released by HQ USAF/SGMC to
resource management officers in October. Post full meal rate prices at the dining room entrance
or serving areas. All MTF staff members must pay for all food consumed.
   6.12.1. Transient patient. Transient patients in the aeromedical evacuation system do not pay
   or sign for meals. They are identified by the patient identification wristband or IAW local
   procedures. A patient ceases to be a transient patient when admitted to a MTF. The number
   of transient patients at each meal is recorded as a Remain Over Night (RON) patient on the
   AF Accounting Spreadsheet (automated) or AF Form 544, Nutritional Medicine Daily
   Facility Summary Report (manual). Breakfast meals are calculated to receive .20 meal credit;
   lunch and dinner .40 meal credit.
38                                                            AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011


  6.12.2. . Nonmedical attendant (NMA). The nonmedical attendant of a hospitalized patient
  pays the appropriate charges for all meals consumed.
  6.12.3. Essential Station Messing (ESM). ESM diners are enlisted members authorized to eat
  at government expense. Medical enlisted personnel and airmen assigned to the MTF present
  their DoD Common Access Card (CAC) Identification Card. Enlisted personnel who are in
  TDY status show valid orders and their DoD CAC Identification Card.
     6.12.3.1. The OIC/NCOIC of NM validate ESM diners using Social Security Numbers
     for identification and spot check signature/cashier records to ensure that only authorized
     personnel are subsisting at government expense. A currently listing of ESM diners from
     the base Force Support Squadron should be received and reviewed at least monthly.
  6.12.4. Inpatients and ambulatory procedures visit (APV)/same day surgery (SDS).
  Inpatients and APV/SDS patients are identified by nursing staff using AF Form 1094.
     6.12.5. Outpatients. Outpatients in the MTF for treatment can purchase meals from
     vending machines or directly from NM as guests. Outpatients who are not in a status as
     APV or SDS may be required to stay in a treatment area (i.e. clinic or emergency room)
     for an extended period of time through meal periods. Local guidance should be developed
     to identify which treatments or procedures would justify the patient receiving a meal as
     part of their procedure or medical management and when NM could claim meal day
     credit versus the patient paying cash for meals as a guest. Meal credit is computed using
     established APV/SDS procedures.
  6.12.6. Wounded Warrior (WW) Meals. In accordance with the National Defense
  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, section 602, MTFs provide meals at no cost (and no
  surcharge) to certain injured members of the Armed Forces while receiving health care
  services for an injury, illness, or disease incurred in support of OPERATION IRAQI
  FREEDOM, OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM, or any other operation or area
  designated by the Secretary of Defense. Health Care services include medical recuperation
  or therapy or other continuous care as an inpatient or outpatient.
     6.12.6.1. Wounded Warriors (WW) will present DoD Form 714, Meal Card, indicating
     that member is a WW entitled to a meal free of charge. In addition, WW’s must present
     CAC Military Identification Card.
         6.12.6.1.1. For bases that do not have a local WW Liaison Office or Coordinator to
         issue WW meal card (DoD Form 714, Meal Card), NM will establish a local
         guidance to properly identify eligible WWs to help prevent fraud, waste and abuse of
         this privilege.
     6.12.6.2. The NM cashier will process the WW’s meal at no cost and input meal
     purchase into the cash register system IAW local procedures.
     6.12.6.3. WW will sign a separate AF IMT 79 entitled, ―Wounded Warrior‖. AF IMT 79
     will include at a minimum WW name, rank, unit of assignment, and contact information.
     6.12.6.4. The number of WW meals served will be entered daily as a wounded warrior
     into the AF Accounting Spreadsheet.
AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011                                                                         39


       6.12.6.5. A tally of total WW meals will be tracked on the AF Accounting Spreadsheet
       and NM will provide monthly cost and service summaries per local guidance obtained
       from AFSVA.
       6.12.6.6. NM will advertise the WW meal program by posting the Assistance Secretary
       of Defense for Health Affairs Memorandum dated 4 February 2009 on bulletin board(s)
       in the NM department visible to patrons.
   6.12.7. Guests and duty personnel. Guests and duty personnel will normally obtain, pay for,
   and consume meals in the dining room. ―Take out‖ provision for meals will be established
   according to local guidance. Parents (nonpatients) who are required by the physician to stay
   on the pediatric inpatient unit to be with their child (the patient) may be served meals on the
   unit. These meals must be paid for prior to delivery, except when local guidance allows for
   the provision of parental meals. When the infant is readmitted and the parent (nonpatient) is
   required to stay with the infant as a parental bonder, the parent may receive a tray in place of
   the infant. Local guidance that identifies situations where the parent is considered part of the
   treatment must be established if NM determines it is appropriate to provide parental meals.
6.13. ALACS Recipe Pricing Operations. In ALACS each recipe item is priced and sold on
an individual item basis. Computerized menu pricing reports such as the Computrition Recipe
Price Report must be available. Each recipe cost that is not available from these programs must
be manually calculated. Menu item pricing must include surcharges from DoD.
6.14. Special Feeding Circumstances. Responsibilities for control measures, when feeding
under disaster and combat conditions or during field, alert, and medical readiness exercises, are
the same as those under normal circumstances. Personnel who receive monetary allowance for
subsistence must pay for their meals. In as much as possible, normal NM management
procedures apply during disasters, in combat areas, and during field, alert or medical readiness
exercises. Sometimes special cashier procedures during disaster or emergency conditions may
have to be instituted. The installation commander provides the MTF Commander with a
statement (verbal, followed in writing) that emergency or disaster conditions prevail and that it is
essential to furnish food to persons other than those normally allowed. Those persons able to pay
for meals sign AF IMT 79 if required, and pay according to Attachment 3 of this Manual. Those
persons unable to pay for meals sign a separate AF IMT 79. The diet therapy supervisor or other
specified person writes the name of the group of persons being fed on the AF IMT 79 above the
title. If it is not feasible to obtain signatures, as in the case where food support is provided to
another civilian hospital, the NM officer certifies the number of meals furnished on a separate
AF IMT 79 and includes the statement: ―I certify that (number of meals) were provided to (the
name hospital) in (location) due to (situation, such as hurricane) for (the meal period, meal
date).‖ The number of meals is included on AF Form 544 or AF Accounting Spreadsheet. Credit
is taken for all meals. The MSA officer/NM accountant maintains documentation to prove entries
on AF IMT 79 and 544 or AF Accounting Spreadsheet. If feasible, the MSA officer bills for the
costs of meals provided.
6.15. NM Ration Accounting. For accurate NM financial reports, NM accounting parameters
must be accurate and up to date, whether calculated on the AF Accounting Spreadsheet or
manually.
   6.15.1. A ration is the quantity of nutritionally adequate food required to subsist or feed one
   person for one day.
40                                                             AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011


  6.15.2. The Food Cost Index is a DoD prescribed list of food components and quantities that
  represent the allowance for 100 standard rations, which is used to compute the Basic Daily
  Food Allowance (BDFA).
  6.15.3. The BDFA is a prescribed quantity of food, as defined by components and monetary
  value, required to provide a nutritionally adequate diet for one person for one day.
     6.15.3.1. (Automated) . The MTF BDFA is calculated monthly on the AF Accounting
     Spreadsheet using the most current monthly Food Cost Index. The template built into the
     AF Accounting Spreadsheet must follow the Food Cost Index obtained from Defense
     Logistics Agency. For correct computation of this allowance, using a prime vendor
     contracts or DeCA the exact subsistence items referred to by the National Stock Number
     (NSN) need to be verified and substituted with a comparable item offered by the local
     prime vendor.
  6.15.4. Patient Basic Daily Food Allowance (Patient BDFA) is the MTF BDFA with an
  added 15 percent supplemental allowance (Patient Supplemental Percentage) to help defray
  the cost of bulk nourishments. The Patient BDFA is only used to calculate patient meal day
  earnings. Only one Patient BDFA applies for the full calendar month.
     6.15.4.1. (Automated) Use AF Accounting Spreadsheet to compute Patient BDFA for
     patient meal days served each day.
  6.15.5. Small Volume Feeding Allowance/Percentage. NM activities using SCAMS and
  serving less than 100 average daily meal days for both patient and dining room patron rations
  are authorized an additional supplemental allowance of 15 percent of the MTF BDFA in
  order to adjust for the increased costs of feeding a smaller number of people. This eligibility
  is determined at the end of each month and is applied to ESM and SCAMS dining room
  patrons only. It is not authorized for ALACS cash sales. If allowed, the 15 percent
  supplemental allowance is used to figure the next month’s MTF BDFA.
  6.15.6. Therapeutic Inflight Meal (TIM) Allowance. A special monetary allowance equal to
  80 percent of the MTF BDFA is authorized for each TIM furnished by the NM activity for
  aeromedical evacuation patients to be consumed in flight. Additional guidance may be found
  in AFI 41-301, Worldwide Aeromedical Evacuation System, and AFI 41-307, Aeromedical
  Evacuation Patient Considerations and Standards of Care.
  6.15.7. Holiday and Special Meal Percentages/Allowances. An additional meal allowance is
  permitted for all federal holidays, the Air Force birthday, Easter, and Airmen appreciation
  meals. The extra earnings allowed for holidays and special meals are designed to recoup
  additional costs incurred, to include serving items in the dining room to ESM patrons at all
  facilities and cash patrons at SCAMS facilities (e.g., nut cups, ice cream, cake, candy, etc.).
  For federal holidays, the Air Force birthday and Easter, an additional 25% meal allowance is
  permitted. For airman appreciation meals, an additional 15% is allowed. To claim the
  additional percentage, holiday meals must be served only on the actual day designated as the
  holiday. Christmas and Thanksgiving holiday meals must be served at the lunch meal. There
  must be a special menu planned and served to qualify for the additional allowance. A la Carte
  facilities do not receive an additional 25% on cash customers or patients during these meals.
     6.15.7.1. (Automated) AF Accounting Spreadsheet automatically calculates the
     additional 25 percent holiday lunch percentage for Thanksgiving and Christmas. To
AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011                                                                      41


      calculate extra earnings for other holidays and special meals in SCAMS facilities, the
      number of ESM lunch meals served is added to the number of cash patron lunch meals
      served and this is then multiplied by 25 percent (or 15 percent for airman appreciation
      meals) to equal the additional number of meal days. This additional number of meal days
      multiplied by the current MTF BDFA will equal the amount of additional earnings for the
      holiday lunch meal. For ALACS facilities the same procedure is followed, only the
      additional meal day earnings for other federal holidays is determined only by the number
      of ESM customers served.
   6.15.8. Occupied Bed Day refers to the number of inpatients subsisting in the MTF and
   equals beds occupied minus bassinets from the Admission and Disposition Recapitulation
   Report.
   6.15.9. A Meal Day is a value in which the number of meals is weighted by a predetermined
   percentage (IAW DOD 1338.10-M) to balance the cost and attendance variances between the
   meals. The number of meal days for a given day is figured by multiplying the number of
   breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals served by the factored percentages of 20, 40, and 40
   percent, respectively, and totaling the results. TIMs are valued at 80 percent, APV/SDS
   meals at 40 percent, holiday meals at 65 percent, and, if served, midnight meal at 20 percent.
   6.15.10. Patient Meal Days are obtained by multiplying the occupied bed days times the
   appropriate meal factors.
   6.15.11. ESM Meal Days are obtained by multiplying the number of ESM patrons multiplied
   by the appropriate meal factors.
   6.15.12. Cash Patron Meal Days are obtained by multiplying the number of cash customers
   times the appropriate meal factors.
6.16. Subsistence Account Reporting and Management.
   6.16.1. The AF Accounting Spreadsheet and Computrition are used to assist NM managers
   in overseeing their subsistence account, inventory value, earnings and collections.
      6.16.1.1. (Automated) . The AF Accounting Spreadsheet has all of the information
      needed to monitor key financial indicators in NM.
          6.16.1.1.1. The Inventory Movement Summary Report provides detailed information
          pertaining to food purchases. The report can be sorted by food categories or dollar
          value. The verified total from this report should be compared to the cost of food
          purchased for the day from invoices received.
          6.16.1.1.2. The Inventory Value Report lists inventory items by category, NSN,
          vendor issue unit, issue cost, quantity on hand, and value of current inventory. This
          value is entered on the AF Accounting Spreadsheet.
      6.16.1.2. (Manual) . The following three manual cost data records and financial reports
      may be used in NM and the MSA office to determine financial status. Follow specific
      instructions on forms for completion.
          6.16.1.2.1. AF Form 544 is used to record the number of meals served in MTFs. The
          information on AF Form 544 is used as a guide for determining the number of meals
          to prepare, deciding on quantities of food to purchase, store and issue, helping to
42                                                              AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011


        control food costs, and providing cumulative daily, monthly, quarterly, and yearly
        cost data. The form covers two categories of inpatients, four categories of diners in
        the dining room, and TIMs. A separate form is used daily and then taken to the MSA
        office where the rest of the rations earnings record is completed.
        6.16.1.2.2. AF Form 541 provides quarterly and cumulative fiscal year summary data
        on food purchased in NM. It shows the financial status operating under the SCAMS
        management system.
        6.16.1.2.3. AF Form 546 provides an overview of daily financial transactions and
        current monthly cumulative totals.
     6.16.1.3. Inpatient Diet Census. Workload figures for the number of trays served to
     patients on the nursing units and the number and types of therapeutic diets served will be
     documented on AF Form 2573, Diet Census, once daily, following procedures printed on
     the reverse side of the form. NM gives the workload figures and weighted diet census
     from AF Form 2573 to the MSA Office per local guidance.
     6.16.1.4. Air Force Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA) Reporting. On a monthly
     basis, MTF’s with food service operations will submit a spreadsheet including the
     information/data in Attachment 4 to their MTF MSA Office and MAJCOM Consultant
     RD and Functional Manager. The MAJCOM Functional Manager will submit a
     consolidated report (Excel spreadsheet), for their MAJCOM, by MTF, to the AFMOA
     Uniform Business Office IAW AFI 41-120 and Attachment 4.
  6.16.2. Subsistence Account Management. Primary indicators which evaluate the financial
  status of the NM operation are: earnings less food served, earnings minus purchases,
  inventory level, and periodic inventory adjustment.
     6.16.2.1. Financial Parameters. The financial status of the NM subsistence account is
     measured using food issues adjusted for spoilage and supplemental/other income, which
     then becomes food served. The status of earnings minus issues must not exceed (plus or
     minus) 5 percent of the average monthly ration earnings at the end of each of the first
     three quarters of the fiscal year as annotated on the AF Accounting Spreadsheet. At the
     end of the fiscal year, earnings minus issues must not be more than $100.00 or (plus or
     minus) 2 percent of the average monthly credit earnings, whichever is greater.
     6.16.2.2. Fiscal Year Close-out. If, at the end of the fiscal year, the earnings minus
     issues on The AF Accounting Spreadsheet or line 57 of AF Form 544 exceeds (plus or
     minus) 2 percent of the average monthly earnings (line 55, fiscal year column, divided by
     12), the MTF Commander can consider Report of Survey Action.
     6.16.2.3. Transferring a Subsistence Account when Food Served Exceeds Credit
     Earnings. A report of survey is initiated when a new NM officer or NCOIC (when no
     dietitian is assigned), accepts a subsistence account where the authorized parameters for
     the current quarter have not been met. The officer who writes the report of survey
     determines if there is an excessive loss, the cause of the loss, and any pecuniary liability,
     and then makes recommendations. If pecuniary liability is found, the commander takes
     disciplinary action. If the investigation shows an excessive loss, the MTF commander
     may request MAJCOM/SG authority to over purchase at the end of the subsequent fiscal
     quarters and at the end of the fiscal year, that portion of the loss that exceeds 2 percent of
AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011                                                                         43


       the monthly monetary credit earnings. The request must show that the MTF cannot
       absorb the loss over a period of 3 months or by the end of the fiscal year unless it reduces
       food services or menu quality to the point where it would harm the morale and welfare of
       the subsisting patients and enlisted personnel.
6.17. Expense, Personnel Utilization and Workload Reporting. MEPRS is an accounting
system used by the AF Medical Service that provides NM managers with manpower, cost
distribution, expense and workload reporting data. NM expense, personnel utilization and
workload data are collected for this system through manual and automated processes. Since
MEPRS data are used to determine manpower requirements, expense allocation and productivity,
NM input needs to be current, accurate and complete.
   6.17.1. Functional Cost Codes (FCCs) and Usage. FCCs are used for all DoD Nutritional
   Medicine organizations. FCCs are used to record NM expenditures, personnel time, and
   workload. Specific written guidance governs MEPRS procedures and FCC usage: DoD 6010-
   13-M, Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System for Fixed Military Medical and
   Dental Treatment Facilities Manual, and AFI 41-102, AF Medical Expense and Performance
   Reporting System (MEPRS) for Fixed Military Medical and Dental Treatment Facilities. The
   FCCs that are used most frequently in NM are as follows:
       6.17.1.1. (EIA) Patient Food Operations. Provides meal service to inpatients and
       transient patients. It includes activities such as routine inpatient rounds, therapeutic menu
       development, patient tray assembly, and any activities related to patient feeding. Supply
       expenditures include the following examples: enteral nutrition formulas, diet kits, paper
       products for patient tray use only, insulated mugs and bowls used for the patient tray line,
       selective menus, tray mats, office supplies used solely for inpatient feeding.
       6.17.1.2. (EIB) Combined Food Operations. Includes subsistence, food preparation, and
       services that are used for inpatient or non-patient feeding in the dining room. This may
       include menu and recipe development for regular menu items, sanitation of combined
       areas, and subsistence accounting. Supply expenditures include the following examples:
       cleaning supplies, plastic wrap, cooks’ knives, flatware, china, glassware, general office
       supplies, and paper products used for both patient tray assembly and the dining room.
       6.17.1.3. (EIC) Inpatient Clinical Dietetics. Includes basic and comprehensive
       nutritional care for patients. Activities include coordination of changes in diet
       requirements; developing nutrition care plans; nutritional assessment and counseling, and
       clinical nutrition management activities. Supply expenditures include pocket computers
       for inpatient dietitians.
       6.17.1.4. (FDC) Nonpatient Food Operations. Includes nutrition management expenses
       unrelated to patient care, but in support of staff and visitors. Supply expenses include
       dining room trays, supplies for cafeteria serving line, cash register tape, and napkins for
       dining room use.
       6.17.1.5. (BAL) Outpatient Nutrition Clinic. Includes comprehensive nutritional care to
       outpatients including appointment scheduling, assessing and planning nutrition care,
       individual and group instruction, and publication management of instruction materials
       and handouts. Supply expenses include nutrient analysis programs used for weight
 44                                                             AFMAN44-144 29 JUNE 2011


       management, nutrition clinic office supplies, instructional materials used for outpatient
       counseling.
   6.17.1.6. (FAZ) Health and Wellness Center. Includes administering the HEAR (Health
   Evaluation Assessment Review), awareness, education and interventions (including
   screenings) for tobacco prevention/cessation, fitness health assessment and enhancement
   exercise prescription, stress management, substance abuse, cardiovascular disease
   prevention, cancer prevention, injury prevention, and medical self-care. These activities can
   be conducted at work sites, through outreach programs, in the health and wellness center.
   Non-MNT awareness prevention nutrition education that is not individualized care should be
   counted as FAZ versus BALA (BE WELL, the AF Fitness Program intervention program, is
   one example).
   6.17.2. Personnel Time/Utilization. The timely and accurate control of personnel data is
   essential for the total success of the MEPRS as personnel costs are the largest expense in the
   MTF budget. Time (hours) worked is reported through manual entry into the Defense
   Medical Human Resources System-internet (DMRSHi). Each individual is responsible for
   accurately reporting hours worked to the correct FCC. A work center monitor should be
   appointed whose job it is to review DMRSHi for accuracy, consistency, and appropriate
   FCCs, before they are submitted to the DMRSHi Program Manager.
       6.17.2.1. Contract Services/Sharing Agreements. For contracts in any area within
       dietetics services, the cost should be allocated in the appropriate MEPRS account codes
       based on the type of work accomplished. This allocation may done based on contractor’s
       estimates or any method that NM management deems appropriate to reflect the percent of
       cost allocated in each code based on the cost of labor and supplies used.
   6.17.3. Inpatient weighted nutrition procedures are provided to RMO monthly for inclusion
   in MEPRS.
6.18. Budgets. The purpose of an operations and maintenance budget is to plan for the
expenditure of funds in a manner that meets mission objectives within financial limitations. The
budget planning process requires time and effort to do well in order to make sure sufficient funds
are available for NM operations. The MTF budget cycle usually begins a few months before the
start of the fiscal year. NM operating budgets are developed to include projections for supplies,
equipment purchases and maintenance costs, and required travel. To develop an operating budget
the following steps are followed:
   6.18.1. Collect data, to include the previous year’s budget, actual expenses for the last year,
   projections for new programs or services, inflation rate, and workload trends.
   6.18.2. Compare data: Analyze last year’s budget versus expenditures, and reasons for
   variation.
   6.18.3. Compile data: Obtain current cost data for equipment and supplies, projected supply
   usage, anticipating needs in all NM areas, including educational materials. Obtain input from
   key NM personnel.
   6.18.4. Draft the budget: Determine annual and quarterly costs.
