1. Mission: The 919 SOW, a classic association with the Air Force Special Operations Air
Warfare Center (AFSOAWC), provides Combat Aviation Advisors and operations and
maintenance personnel to support the Aviation Foreign Internal Defense (AvFID) and Non-
Standard Aviation (NSAv) programs for the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC)
through the use of the C-145A and C-146A aircraft. The wing conducts U-28, C-145A, C-146A,
and AC-130U Formal Training Unit (FTU) flight instruction. It also employs the MQ-9 Predator
remotely piloted aircraft. The wing provides personnel to support AFSOC taskings and AFRC
Air Expeditionary Force taskings relating to security forces, civil engineering, communications,
logistics, supply, transportation, services and personnel functions.
2. Command. The 919 SOW Commander (CC):
     2.1. Reports to the Tenth Air Force CC.
     2.2. Exercises administrative control over assigned personnel.
3. Responsibilities.
     3.1. Execute commander’s responsibilities as outlined in AFI 1-2, Commanders
     Responsibilities.
     3.2. Provides oversight and execution of the special operations mission.
4. Mobilization. AFRC forces are under the administrative control (ADCON) of AFRC/CC.
When activated or mobilized (e.g. under 10 U.S.C. §§ 12301(a), 12302, 12304, 12304a, or
12304b), combatant command authority (COCOM) transfers to the combatant commander to
which the forces are assigned/attached and operational control (OPCON) transfers to the
operational chain of command established by that commander.
