1. The Air Force will construct and advocate budgets which provide the warfighting Commanders in
Chief the resources required to execute USAF program and mission responsibilities derived from the
National Military Strategy and Defense Planning Guidance. Air Force budgets should be credible, defen-
sible to the Congress, executable, and should contribute to cost-effective performance of the Air Force’s
mission. In achieving this end, the Air Force needs budget policies to safeguard its commitment to law-
ful, effective, and efficient use of appropriated funds. This directive establishes policies for complying
with applicable laws and Department of Defense (DoD) funding guidance in all phases of the budget
cycle, and which govern the formal process of prioritizing and applying appropriated funds to support Air
Force missions. A | (bar) indicates revisions from the previous edition.

2. The Air Force will ensure appropriated funds, including expired funds and Air Force Working Capital
Fund (AFWCF) [formerly Defense Business Operations Fund ] accounts, are used only for authorized
purposes, as enacted by Congress and implemented under DoD and Air Force directives and instructions.
Also, the Air Force will ensure appropriated funds are used only in the amounts and for the time periods
authorized by the applicable budget authorization, allocation, and allotment.

3. The Air Force will make sure that AF Form 401, Budget Authority (BA)/Allotment (A) and AF
Form 1449, Operating Budget Authority (OBA) and the AFWCF’s Annual Operating Budget (AOB)
documents issued to subordinate activities will not exceed the authority received by the issuing activity.
BAs, OBAs, and AOBs issued must be consistent with budget and obligation authority received with
respect to classifications, authorities, and constraints.

4. The Air Force will take timely and aggressive action to identify, investigate, report, and process
Antideficiency Act (ADA) violations.

5. Subject to limitations and restrictions established by the legislative and executive branches of the Gov-
ernment and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Air Force will provide optimum funding flexibil-
ity at all levels.

6. In case of conflicts with other Air Force directives, the funding propriety rules stated herein and in Air
Force Instruction (AFI) 65-601, volume 1, US Air Force Budget Policies and Procedures [formerly AFR
172-1, volume 1], take precedence.

7. This directive establishes the following responsibilities and authorities:

       the Operating Budget Review Committee. AFPD 90-6. The Air Force Corporate Structure, and
       AFI 16-501, Control and Documentation of Air Force Programs, provide overall Air Force Board
       responsibilities and membership.
    7.2. The Deputy Assistant Secretary, Financial Operations (SAF/FMP) establishes policy for and
    executes the Air Force’s program for identifying, investigating, reporting, and processing ADA viola-
    tions.
    7.3. Air Force commanders and managers use their organizations' appropriated funds legally, effec-
    tively, and efficiently.
    7.4. Commanders at all levels establish and maintain financial management structures to determine
    funding priorities, to approve financial plans, and to ensure that funding resources are allocated and
    executed legally, effectively, and efficiently.
    7.5. Major Command, Direct Reporting Unit, and Field Operating Agency financial management
    organizations will have primary responsibility for training, developing, and maintaining a roster of
    trained ADA investigating officers; ensuring investigating officer independence; providing expert
    technical assistance, as necessary, to investigating officers; advising the Commander on the financial

Terms
Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) [formerly Defense Business—O p e r a t i o n s          Fund
(DBOF)] The AFWCF was established on 11 Dec 1996 through the restructure of the DBOF into
individual component working capital funds. AFWCF activities sell goods and services to a wide range
of customers, including DoD operating forces, Air Force activities, other US government activities and
foreign military sales customers. The AFWCF activity groups include Depot Maintenance, Supply
Management, and Information Services. Effective in FY 1998, USTRANSCOM’S Transportation
Working Capital Fund (TWCF), previously known as DBOF-Transportation, will report to the AFWCF
for cash management.
Antideficiency Act (ADA)—Legislation enacted by Congress to prevent the incurring of obligations or
the making of expenditures (outlays) in excess of amounts available in appropriations or funds; to fix
responsibility within an agency for the creation of any obligation or the making of any expenditure in
excess of an apportionment or reapportionment or in excess of other subdivisions of funds; and to assist in
bringing about the most effective and economical use of appropriations and funds. (See Department of
Defense Financial Management Regulation, Volume 14, Administrative Control of Funds and
Antideficiency Act Violations, August 1, 1995).
Budget Authorization, Allocation and Allotment—Budget authorizations represent the approved
financial program with which the recipient can plan to accomplish the mission in an orderly manner. An
allocation is a funding document issued by SAF/FMB to a major command or field operating agency
which represents cash for commitment or obligation. An allotment is similar to an allocation except that
it is issued by a major command or field operating agency to subordinate units.
Budget Authority (BA), Operating Budget Authority (OBA) Document—BA and OBA documents
are the official documents that convey obligation and expense authority for a given fiscal year.
Limitations and or restrictions are identified on this document. The OBA document (AF Form 1449 or
mechanized equivalent) is used for the Operation and Maintenance appropriations (USAF and AF
Reserve). The Budget Authority document (AF Form 401) is used for other appropriations.
Canceled Accounts—An appropriation or fund which is no longer available for obligation adjustments
or payments. Appropriations are closed or canceled at the end of the five year expired period. A canceled
obligation is one that was not paid (check drawn) at the time the appropriation was canceled.
Expired Funds—Appropriations which are no longer available for new obligations, but have not been
canceled. Appropriations are in an expired status for five years. During the expired period, an
appropriation retains its original identification and is available for adjusting and liquidating obligations,
including within-scope contract changes. (See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Chapter 6, Expired And Canceled
Appropriations.)
Retail Supply—Consists of parts of the Supply Management Activity Group of AFWCF. Specifically,
this includes the resources and costs of the General Support Division, Fuels Division, Medical-Dental
Division, Troop Support Division, and Air Force Academy Cadet Store.
Wholesale Supply—Consists of parts of the Supply Management Activity Group of AFWCF.
Specifically, this includes resources and costs of the Material Support Divisions which consolidated the
Reparable Support Division, the System Support Division and the Cost of Operations Division.

Obligation—Amounts of orders placed, contracts awarded, services received, and similar transactions
during a given period requiring future payment of money. (See AFR 170-8, Accounting for Obligations.)
Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS)—The DOD resource management system
used to establish, maintain, and update the Future Years Defense Program and DOD portion of the
President’s Budget. It is a biennial, process containing three interrelated phases: planning,
programming, and budgeting. Sometimes referred to as the Biennial Planning, Programming and
Budgeting System (BPPBS).
Unit Cost Per Output—The unit cost, or cost per output, concept has been established by the DoD
Comptroller for business areas in the AFWCF, as well as certain other areas not yet in the AFWCF. For
these business areas, high level goals and fixed prices make it possible to measure changes in cost based
on financial operating results. Unit cost per output is the relationship of total resource expenditure for a
given output. It requires output identification and uses managerial accounting techniques to rationally
attribute direct and indirect cost to that output. Unit cost per output is a the measure of efficiency, and the
resourcing and financing tool for DoD working Capital Fund activities.

                          MEASURING COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY

A2.1. SAF/FM will assess compliance with policy regarding the proper use of appropriated funds by
measuring reported violations. Analysis will consider both open- and closed-violation reports, and will
focus on overall trends and the types of violations that are reported. (See Figure A2.1., Figure A2.2. and
Figure A2.3.) An open case exists when a possible violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act has been dis-
closed, but no determination has yet been made whether a violation actually occurred. Cases are closed
when it has been determined either that a reportable violation did not occur, or that it did occur and the
investigation and legal review were completed. We will track violations in four categories:
   A2.1.1. Obligating more than the available funds in an appropriation, allocation, allotment or other
   administrative subdivision of funds.
   A2.1.2. Improperly applying funds with regard to the purposes for which the funds were authorized
   and appropriated.
   A2.1.3. Improperly applying funds with regard to the fiscal year (FY) charged for the expense.
   A2.1.4. Violating other special limitations imposed in funding documents, statutes, or other applica-
   ble directives (e.g., minor construction ceilings, expense or investment thresholds, reprogramming
   limits, AFWCF capital budget limitations, 1-percent rule for funding canceled obligations from cur-
   rent year accounts, etc.).

A2.2. SAF/FMP will assess compliance with the policy that the AF take timely and aggressive action to
identify, investigate, report, and process ADA violations by measuring timely investigation performance.
The time taken to complete and submit all formal ADA investigations to the Under Secretary of Defense
(Comptroller) will be measured in order to insure the facts and circumstances are reported within nine
months of the investigation start. (See figure A2.7.)

A2.3. SAF/FMB will assess compliance with the policy that AF funds are allocated and executed in an
effective and efficient manner by measuring the achievement of unit-cost-per-output goals and effective-
ness performance goals in operating budgets. When applicable, these measurements will be used on BA
and OA documents and in justifying and presenting the budget, as determined by the DoD Comptroller.
Initially, the focus will be on AFWCF and unit costed activities. (See Figure A2.4. and Figure A2.5.)

A2.4. SAF/FMB will also assess the goal of executing appropriated funds in an effective and efficient
manner by comparing current to prior-year obligation rates. This comparison will be made for the four
procurement accounts (Aircraft, Missile, Munitions and Other) and Research, Development, Test and
Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriation. End-of-year actual obligations expressed as a percentage of avail-
able funding will be compared to the prior 3-year average for each account. All applicable unexpired
accounts will be included in both the current- and prior-year computations. For example, FY 1993 Air-
craft Procurement obligations will include cumulative obligations for the FY 91/3, FY 92/4 and FY 93/5
appropriations. (See Figure A2.6.)
