SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. AFI 13-213, Airfield
Management, 29 Jan 2008; Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5 thru 7 were rescinded and incorporated into AFI
13-204, Airfield Operations Volumes 1 and 3, dated 1 Sep 2010. Major changes include
changing the AFI title from Airfield Management to Airfield Driving, updating airfield driving
procedures, training standards and program management. This AFI also incorporates runway
incursion prevention methods outlined in the USAF/A/3/5 message Date Time Group: 062240
Zulu Feb 2009. A number of editorial/reference corrections were also made.

(TYNDALL) This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
The standards and directives on the following pages have been established for the control of all
motor vehicles on the Tyndall AFB (TAFB) airfield. Only trained personnel will be assigned
duties which involve driving on the airfield. The use of vehicles on the airfield will be limited to
the absolute minimum required to accomplish the mission. Motor vehicles present a clear and
obvious danger to aircraft and ground personnel. Carelessness, haste, and disregard for
established safety standards are the primary sources of aircraft/vehicle collisions, incidents, and
personnel injury involving motor vehicles on the airfield. Persons assigned to the airfield or to
AFI13-213_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 3 October 2012                                                                                                      3


activities related to the airfield are required to be familiar with the provisions of this supplement,
AFI 13-213, Airfield Driving and exercise good judgment when encountering situations not
addressed during training.

                                             Chapter 1

                                   GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope and Purpose.
     1.1.1. This AFI provides guidance for developing an Airfield Driving Program (ADP) to
     provide safe ground vehicle operations and pedestrian control on USAF owned and/or
     operated airfields. It outlines training requirements for all personnel (e.g. military, DoD
     Civilians, Contractors, etc.) who, as a part of their job, are required to drive unescorted on an
     airfield.
     1.1.2. Personnel required to drive on the airfield must be knowledgeable of and comply with
     the procedures outlined in this AFI and locally developed Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI).
     For the purpose of this AFI, the ADI is a wing or base level instruction.
     1.1.3. In today’s complex airfield environment, there are incidents involving aircraft,
     pedestrians, and ground vehicles at USAF airfields that lead to property damage and
     personnel injury. One of the most hazardous incidents for an airfield driver to be involved
     with is a runway incursion. A runway incursion occurs when an aircraft, vehicle or person
     enters the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-off of aircraft
     without approval from Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT). Runway incursions have the
     potential to result in aircraft endangerment and loss of life. While there are several factors
     involved in a runway incursion, the leading causes of these incidents result from a failure to
     follow procedures, inadequate vehicle operator training, and loss of situational awareness.
     Therefore, strict adherence to the procedures in this AFI is essential to preventing aircraft-
     vehicle mishaps and personnel injury on the airfield.
     1.1.4. Shared-Use Airfields. Airfield Management (AM) personnel at shared-use airfields
     (e.g. Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve units) must work with the civil airport manager
     to develop and implement local airfield driving procedures where applicable.
     1.1.5. Contingency Locations. At contingency locations, the Senior Airfield Authority
     (SAA) or equivalent, may authorize deviations to airfield driving procedures outlined in this
     AFI to support tactical or combat operations/situations. Authority must not be delegated.
        1.1.5.1. In the interest of safety to airfield and flight operations, deviations to this AFI
        should be by exception only and include a Risk Management assessment. Factors to
        consider for deviations include but are not limited to the length of time the operation has
        been in place and available resources.
        1.1.5.2. If time permits, or at the discretion of the SAA or equivalent, forward proposed
        deviations to the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, for an operational review.
        1.1.5.3. Provide the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, an informational copy of
        approved deviations to assist with establishing compliance priorities, providing oversight,
        and developing area of responsibility execution activities.
1.2. Waivers, Recommended Changes and Issuing New Airfield Driving Policy or
Procedures.
     1.2.1. Waivers.

     1.2.1.1. Waiver Authority. HQ AFFSA/A3A will provide waivers to this instruction
     only upon an official MAJCOM OPR for AO request when a requirement makes a waiver
     necessary or compliance with creates a hazard. HQ AFFSA/A3A grants waivers to this
     AFI for a period not to exceed two years.
     1.2.1.2. Waiver Process. AF IMT 4058, Airfield Operations Policy Waiver will be used

  individuals that have a requirement to drive a vehicle on the CMA are administered a color
  vision test. Note: Individuals that are required to have normal color vision as a part of their
  AFSC only require verification that they successfully completed a color vision test by a
  Hospital/Medical Treatment Facility Optometrist or off-base equivalent. See AFI 48-123,
  Medical Examinations and Standards for additional information.
  3.2.5. (TYNDALL) Color Vision Requirements. Personnel that require driving in the
  CMA must complete color vision testing or provide verification of previous color vision
  screening results to the Unit ADPM for validation. Personnel who do not have a requirement
  to drive in the CMA or fail the color vision test do not require a color vision test and will
  have ramp only access stamped “TYNDALL AFB Ramp Only” annotated on the AF IMT
  483.
     3.2.5.1. Contact the base hospital/medical treatment facility Optometrist for assistance in
     determining the best process for administering the color vision test to drivers that operate
     a vehicle on the CMA.
     3.2.5.1. (TYNDALL) 325th MDG/SGOPF optometry clinic personnel will sign and
     stamp Section IV of the TAFB IMT 174 (Attachment 5), under Medical Treatment
     Facility Certification. Tyndall Optometry clinic accepts walk-ins and is open Monday-
     Friday 0730-1630L. Personnel that have a mandatory requirement for color vision (entry
     or retention) in the Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) are exempt from color vision
     testing.
     3.2.5.2. Individuals that fail to pass the color vision test can be issued a "Limited
     Access" AF IMT 483. Note: Access to the CMA must not be granted.
     3.2.5.3. Refer to the Officer and Enlisted Classification Directory for AFSCs that have a
     mandatory requirement for normal color vision in their Air Force Specialty Code
     (AFSC). Both products are available for viewing and download on the AF Portal. Note:
     Unit ADPM must still validate individual has normal color vision and/or no waiver to the
     classification directory standards.

     the ILS critical area boundary. Two-way radio communication with the control tower is
     required before entering the critical areas. Tyndall AFB has three areas that penetrate
     these boundaries. Two are located along a perimeter road that penetrates the Runway
     13L glide slope critical area and the other is located on Taxiway Kilo (See Attachment
     9). Vehicles will penetrate these areas when transitioning on Perimeter Road north of
     13L and when operating on Taxiway Kilo in the vicinity of the non-destructive inspection
     (NDI) facility. The Kilo ILS critical area is protected with an instrument hold line. The
     perimeter road critical area north of 13L does not have an instrument hold line, but has
     signs denoting where the area begins. No vehicles are allowed in the critical area when
     an aircraft is on an instrument approach and the ceiling is below 800 feet and visibility is
     less than 2 miles.

        3.2.7.2.3. (TYNDALL) The control tower has authority over all traffic entering the
        CMA and will issue specific instructions to control the movement of aircraft,
        vehicles, equipment, or personnel in the movement area during published airfield
        operating hours. Published airfield operating hours are as follows: M-F, 0600-
        2200L, Sat/Sun, 0900-1700L, and closed federal holidays and weekends associated
        with federal holidays.
        3.2.7.2.4. Vehicle operators must use LED/rotating beacon lights and/or emergency
        flashers when driving in the CMA.
        3.2.7.2.5. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent
        radio mounted in the vehicle to communicate with the ATCT. A hand-held radio
        should only be used as a backup or when communication is required outside the
        vehicle. Note: Conduct an operational test of the radio before entering the airfield.
            3.2.7.2.5.1. (Added-TYNDALL) All vehicles will stop and ensure aircraft right-
            of-way is not hindered before entering a taxi lane. Before proceeding, the
            operator will determine visually that the way is clear. All vehicles entering the
            CMA must have approval from the control tower and maintain two-way radio
AFI13-213_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 3 October 2012                                                     27

           established before gaining access to, crossing, or working next to the CMA. Once
           the control tower approves access, radio contact will be maintained at all times
           while in the CMA.
        3.2.7.2.6. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians operating on the CMA must use a
        distinct call sign (e.g., Airfield 1, Chief 1, Sweeper 1, TA 1, etc.) coordinated by the
        Wing ADPM to avoid duplicating, confusing, or different agencies using similar
        names (e.g. Airfield 1, Airfield Lighting, Airfield Sweeper, etc.). Note: Do not use a
        call sign that is also a part of ATC phraseology such as ―Taxi‖.
           3.2.7.2.6.1. Include vehicle and/or pedestrian call signs in the ADI.
           3.2.7.2.6.2. For standardization, AM personnel will use the radio call signs listed
           below. Note: AM personnel at Joint/Shared-Use and host nation airfields may
           use different vehicle call signs to prevent duplication/similar call signs with local

            the runway and consist of four parallel yellow stripes perpendicular to the axis of
            taxiway centerline, extending across taxiway. The two stripes closest to the
            runway are dashed lines and the other two are solid lines. These lines mark the
            boundary of the CMA. Vehicles will not cross the runway hold position or
            proceed onto the runway without first obtaining permission from the Control
            Tower.
            3.2.7.5.2.4. (Added-TYNDALL) The Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ) is a
            volume of airspace above an area beginning at the runway threshold, at the
            threshold elevation, and centered on the extended runway centerline. The
            standard POFZ is 200 feet (60 meters) long and 800 feet (240 meters) wide. The
            POFZ must be kept clear when an aircraft on a vertically guided final approach is
            within 2 NM of the runway threshold and the reported ceiling is below 250 feet
            and/or visibility less than 3/4 SM (or runway visual range below 4,000 feet). See
            Attachment 6 and 7 for Tyndall AFB POFZ.

        3.2.8.1.2. (Added-TYNDALL) If the Wing ADPM revokes or suspends airfield
        driving rights, the Unit Commander, and Unit ADPM will receive written
        notification.
        3.2.8.1.3. (Added-TYNDALL) The first violation that is a non-CMA violation will
        incur normally a warning or a minimum up to a 30-day suspension of airfield driving
        privileges. For a CMA violation, the individual’s AF IMT 483 will be taken and an
        automatic 30-day suspension from airfield driving privileges will incur.
        3.2.8.1.4. (Added-TYNDALL) The second violation will result in a 60-day
        suspension of airfield driving privileges for non-CMA violations. If the second
        violation was a CMA violation by the same individual in a 12-month time period, a
        permanent revocation of airfield driving privileges will incur.
     3.2.8.2. Procedures for reissuance of an AF IMT 483 after a suspension (e.g. re-training,
     Unit/CC recommendation in writing, limited access, etc.). Include sample MFRs for
     suspension, revocation, and reinstatement of airfield driving privileges.
     3.2.8.2. (TYNDALL) Before and individual will be re-issued their AF IMT 483, Unit
     Commanders and Unit ADPMs will ensure the individual (s) with suspended airfield
     driving privileges are retrained and recertified IAW AFI 13-213 and this supplement.
        3.2.8.2.1. (Added-TYNDALL) Upon completion             of all training requirements, the
        Unit Commander will request reinstatement of           airfield driving privileges. See
        Attachment 10 for example memorandum. Note:            The Unit ADPM will keep the
        reinstatement letter on file for 12 months and will    send a copy of the reinstatement
        letter to the Wing ADPM.
     3.2.8.3. Procedures to report and document CMAV events. A CMAV event is an airfield
     violation caused by aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians entering the CMA without specific
     ATCT approval. This definition also includes runway incursions. A runway incursion is
     a CMAV event that involves the incorrect presence of an aircraft, vehicle or person on
     the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-off of aircraft. For the
     purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA. Runway
     Incursions are further classified into three operational categories (Operational Error, Pilot
     Deviation, and Vehicle/Pedestrian). (See Attachment 1)
     3.2.8.3. (TYNDALL) Procedures to report and document CMAV events will be IAW
     AFI 13-213, paragraphs 3.2.8.3.1. – 3.2.8.3.4.

  RADIO COMMUNICATIONS PHRASEOLOGY, DISCIPLINE AND TECHNIQUES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Radio communications are a critical link in the ATC system. The single, most
   important thought in communications with the ATCT is understanding. It is essential to
   acknowledge each radio communication with controllers by using the appropriate call sign.
   4.1.2. Brevity is important, therefore, radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   However, controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their
   control duties. Conversely, the vehicle operator, must know exactly what the controller
   wants them to do.
   4.1.3. Vehicle operators must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio
   communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating on an
   active runway.
4.2. Radio Techniques.
   4.2.1. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
   transmitter will be ineffective and will probably override/block out the other receiver causing
   the other vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
   4.2.2. Think before keying the transmitter. You must know exactly what you need to say
   before you say it.
   4.2.3. The microphone should be very close to your lips and, after pressing the ―microphone
   button‖, a slight pause may be necessary to be sure, the first word is transmitted clearly.
   Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
   4.2.4. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The
   controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or
   scanning the runway to enable your request.
   4.2.5. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
   recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
   position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
   unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
   ―stuck mike,‖ and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
   problem.
   4.2.6. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the
   ground station equipment. Refer to the airfield diagram to determine possible radio blind
   spots.
   4.2.7. Use caution when using a vehicle mounted/handheld radio and operating a vehicle at
   the same time. When possible, only use the radio when the vehicle is safely parked.
4.3. Phraseology. Vehicle operators must contact the ATCT controller each and every time
they proceed onto or leave the CMA. When proceeding onto a CMA, vehicle operators must
advise the controller of three things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your
 46                                       AFI13-213_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 3 October 2012


intentions are. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications so ground
control and other persons know that the message was received. Vehicle operators must always
give aircraft and ground control transmissions priority unless an emergency exists. VHF/UHF
transmissions are reserved for the primary use of aircraft and ATCT personnel.
   4.3.1. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:

Table 4.1. Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology.
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “JACKSONVILLE TOWER

or for you to hold at the Runway Hold line/VFR hold line prior to receiving approval into the
CMA.
Host Wing Commander—The individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
Hot Spot—A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Immediately—Used by ATC when such action compliance is required to avoid an imminent
situation.
Instrument Hold line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect. Instrument hold line is marked in
retro-reflective yellow paint.
Light Gun—A handheld directional light signaling device which emits a brilliant narrow beam
of white, green, or red light as selected by the tower controller. The color and type of light
transmitted can be used to approve or disapprove anticipated pilot actions where radio
communication is not available. The light gun is used for controlling traffic operating in the
vicinity of the airport and on the airport movement area.
Major Command (MAJCOM)—For the purpose of this instruction, includes all USAF Major
Commands plus the Air National Guard Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve Command, Direct
Reporting Units, and Field Operating Agencies. MAJCOM also refers to the OPR for Airfield
