                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose of Safety Investigations and Reports.
     1.1.1. Safety investigations and reports are conducted and written solely to prevent future
     mishaps. Safety investigations take priority over any accident investigation boards. If
     initiated, criminal investigations take precedence over safety investigations until criminal
     activity, natural causes, and suicide have been ruled out as possible causes of damage, injury,
     or death (for criminal investigations, see paragraph 4.11.2.). Conduct safety and legal
     investigations separately to protect privileged safety information in the safety report. If
     necessary and directed by the convening authority (CA), safety investigations can be done
     concurrently with other applicable investigations. Privileged safety information resulting
     from a safety investigation will be used solely for mishap prevention (See Chapter 3).
     1.1.2. Legal investigations provide a publicly releasable report of the facts and
     circumstances surrounding a mishap. The purpose of a legal investigation is to inquire into
     all the facts and circumstances surrounding mishaps as well as to obtain and preserve all
     available evidence for use in litigation, claims, disciplinary action, adverse administrative
     action, and for public disclosure in accordance with (IAW) DoD 5400.7-R, DoD Freedom of
     Information Act.
        1.1.2.1. An Accident Investigation Board (AIB) is one type of legal investigation and is
        convened for many space, aircraft, remotely piloted aircraft/unmanned aerial vehicle
        (RPA/UAV), and missile mishaps IAW AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations.
        Ground Accident Investigation Boards are convened for many ground accidents IAW
        AFI 51-507, Ground Accident Investigations. A Commander-Directed Investigation
        (CDI) is another type of legal investigation that may be convened. A CDI may not be
        used in lieu of a safety investigation. To ensure continued effectiveness of safety
        investigations, other investigations should not be done concurrently unless determined
        necessary IAW paragraph 1.1.1.
        1.1.2.1. (AFGSC) In the event a Commander-Directed Investigation (CDI) is convened,
        CDI Team Members will abide by the SAF/IGQ Commander-Directed Investigation
        (CDI) Guide and report only to the appointing official.
1.2. Waivers to this Instruction. Waivers to this instruction will be requested through the
MAJCOM/SE to AF/SE, and considered Tier-1, unless otherwise specified in this instruction.
Note: For purposes of this instruction, the term "MAJCOM" includes ANG, Direct Reporting
Units (DRUs), and Forward Operating Agencies (FOAs).
1.2. (AFGSC)Waivers to this Instruction. Forward waiver requests through applicable NAF
to AFGSC/SE.
     1.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Waivers to this Supplement. Waivers to this supplement will be
     requested though the applicable NAF to HQ AFGSC/SE, and considered Tier-2 unless
     otherwise specified in this instruction.
1.3. Mishaps and Events Requiring Safety Investigations and Reports.
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                           9


   1.3.1. A mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage
   or injury as described in paragraph 1.3.1.1. and/or meets Class A, B, C, or D mishap
   reporting criteria IAW paragraph 1.10.
      1.3.1.1. Damage or injury includes: damage to DoD property; occupational illness to
      DoD military or civilian personnel; injury to on- or off-duty DoD active military (e.g.
      Title 10 and all AGRs) status; injury to on-duty DoD civilian or inactive military (e.g.
      Title 32) personnel; damage to public or private property, or injury or illness to non-DoD
      personnel caused by Air Force operations. Volunteers (uncompensated staff working
      under the supervision of an agency) in the federal sector are considered employees and
      covered by Part 1960, including the injury and illness recordkeeping requirements from
      29 CFR 1904.
      1.3.1.2. Although motor vehicle mishaps often result from some form of misconduct
      (e.g., speeding, driving while intoxicated, and reckless driving) required data elements
      from these mishaps will be reported in accordance with this instruction.
   1.3.2. An event is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that does not meet
   mishap reporting criteria as defined in paragraph 1.3.1. Class E events require an
   investigation and report (see paragraph 1.10.5.). Reference AFMAN 91-22X for specifics on
   events that meet reporting requirements.
   1.3.3. Mishap Reporting. AF Form 978, Supervisor's Mishap Report, will be used to
   document a Ground mishap to the Unit Commander and Wing Safety. The installation
   Ground Safety Manager will review the form to determine reportability and ensure
   appropriate documentation. Exception: Tenant units with full-time safety staffs will review
   mishap data for their personnel. Aviation, Weapons, and Space disciplines have the option to
   use this form for mishap reporting.
      1.3.3.1. An AF Form 978 will be completed by the injured personnel's supervisor and
      returned to the appropriate safety office within five (5) workdays following the mishap or
      notification of the mishap, whichever is earlier.
1.4. Exceptions to mandatory reporting requirements for this AFI. The following
occurrences do not need to be reported under this instruction.
   1.4.1. Damage or injury by direct action of an enemy or hostile force. This does not include
   suspected cases of Friendly Fire, which will include a safety investigation and report in
   accordance with paragraph 4.11.1.
   1.4.2. Intentional, controlled, in-flight jettison of external stores or release of canopies,
   cargo, doors, drag chutes, hatches, life rafts, auxiliary fuel tanks, aerial refueling
   hoses/drogues, missiles, drones, rockets, payload fairings, explosive munitions, and
   externally carried equipment nonessential to flight unless ensuing reportable damage occurs.
   This includes intentional activation of flares, manually or by automatic countermeasure
   systems, with normal system function and no damage to property on the ground. Note:
   Report intentional jettison of missiles, drones, rockets, aerial refueling hoses/drogues, and
   munitions when the reason for jettison is their malfunction and the damage meets reporting
   criteria. Note: Emergency jettison of external stores does not need to be reported unless the
   resulting jettison causes property damage.
10                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


  1.4.3. Intentional or anticipated damage to DoD equipment or property incurred during
  authorized testing or combat training, including missile and ordnance firing or destruction of
  DoD property to prevent capture by an enemy or hostile force, to include the following:
     1.4.3.1. Intentional electro-explosive device activation when part of a normal missile test
     or launch sequence, the launch is aborted, and there is no other reportable damage.
     1.4.3.2. Expected damage or destruction of equipment, pallets, parachutes, etc., during
     airdrop operations.
     1.4.3.3. Damage to, or destruction of, DoD equipment or property during authorized
     testing, including missile and ordnance firing, and RPA/UAVs used as targets or on
     critical profile missions, provided all of the following conditions exist:
         1.4.3.3.1. The extent of the damage or destruction was an expected or desired result
         of the test.
         1.4.3.3.2. The damage or destruction occurred at planned times and for anticipated
         reasons.
     1.4.3.4. For mishaps involving unmanned Full Scale Aerial Targets (FSATs), the interim
     safety board will conduct a preliminary review of telemetry and/or control system data
     from the Gulf Range Drone Control System (GRDCS) or the Drone Formation Control
     System (DFCS). If the preliminary review indicates the event was related to target
     specific systems or drone modifications, the mishap may be investigated according to
     AFI 99-151, Air Launched Munition Analysis Group (ALMAG). In all other cases, the
     mishap will be investigated under this instruction and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety
     Investigations and Reports.
  1.4.4. Damage or destruction of an RPA resulting from a deliberative risk acceptance
  decision by an appropriate command authority to employ the vehicle in an environment or
  condition where the risk of loss of the vehicle is outweighed by operational requirements.
     1.4.4.1. Although not a reportable mishap, the accountable MAJCOM safety office will
     report this loss to HQ AF/SEI via e-mail. The report will contain the date, location (when
     available), object identifier, short narrative, and the approval authority who accepted the
     risk.
  1.4.5. Except when required to be reported as a Class E event, a safety report is not required
  when all of the following three conditions are true:
     1.4.5.1. The failed item is a component part or line-replaceable unit (LRU). Examples
     include flight line replaceable engine components, electronic boxes, air cycle machines,
     pumps, tires, and drag braces. The following are major assemblies and not component
     parts nor LRUs: aircraft subsystems such as engines, engine modules, landing gear, and
     gearboxes. Note: auxiliary power units are major assemblies unless identified by the
     mission design series (MDS) program manager as an LRU.
     1.4.5.2. All damage and/or wear is confined to that component part or LRU (if not
     confined, all associated damage costs must be added to determine if the occurrence is a
     reportable mishap).
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                           11


     1.4.5.3. The failed item is maintained as fly-to-fail (or normally used until they fail) or
     reached pre-determined wear limits due to normal wear and tear (as defined by the
     applicable technical order or program manager for aviation items).
  1.4.6. Engine foreign object damage (FOD), when discovered outside of base-level
  management (such as during depot-level engine system maintenance, not for known or
  suspected FOD), to aircraft, air-breathing missiles, or drone/UAV/UAS engines. See
  AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports, for detailed investigative
  guidance. Note: FOD may be reportable under TO 00-35D-54, USAF Materiel Deficiency
  Reporting and Investigating System.
  1.4.7. Property damage, death, or injury as a result of vandalism, riots, civil disorders,
  sabotage, terrorist activities, or criminal acts (e.g., arson). Note: Injury or death resulting
  from workplace violence or terrorist acts at work will be recorded (see paragraph 1.13.4.).
  1.4.8. Natural phenomena ground mishaps where adequate preparation, forecasting, and
  communication actions were taken and there were no injuries to DoD personnel. In order to
  determine if adequate actions were taken, an investigation must be initiated.
  1.4.9. Normal residual damage as a result of a missile launch.
  1.4.10. Pre-existing injuries or illnesses sustained before entry into military service or
  employment by the US Government, unless significantly aggravated by current tenure of
  service. See Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Recordkeeping
  Handbook, Section 1904.5 to determine work-relatedness and paragraph 1.5. as applicable.
  1.4.11. Injuries or fatalities to persons in the act of escaping from or eluding military or
  civilian custody or arrest.
  1.4.12. Pre-existing musculoskeletal disorders unless aggravated or accelerated by U.S.
  Government employment. See OSHA Recordkeeping Handbook, Section 1904.5 to
  determine work-relatedness.
  1.4.13. Injury or occupational illness to contractor personnel or damage to contractor
  property or equipment not under direct supervision of DoD personnel, unless caused by DoD
  operations.
  1.4.14. ANG state activated military and ANG state employees on- or off-duty injury or
  illness unless their injury or illness involved Air Force personnel, contractor operations, or
  property.
  1.4.15. Adverse bodily reactions resulting directly from the use of drugs under the direction
  of competent medical authority unless the drugs were prescribed for an injury or illness that
  is work-related.
  1.4.16. Hospitalization beyond the day of admission when:
     1.4.16.1. Hospitalization is for observation, counseling, diagnostic testing, or
     administrative reasons not related to the immediate injury or occupational illness.
     1.4.16.2. Observation and/or Diagnostic Procedures. Hospitalization or restriction from
     assigned work activities for observation or diagnosis is not a "lost time case," "no lost
     time case," or "first aid case" provided no treatment or medication is given for the
     suspected injury or occupational illness. If diagnostic equipment (i.e. X-rays, MRI,
 12                                               AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


       CATScan, etc.) is used, and competent medical authority determines the individual could
       have returned to his or her normal job without impairment or disability, do not consider
       this as a "greater than first aid case." This classification also applies where an individual
       is temporarily restricted from regularly assigned duties to prevent exceeding time-
       weighted exposure limits.
   1.4.17. Death due to natural causes unrelated to strenuous acts performed at work or to
   physical training associated with the requirement to pass physical standards. Note:
   However, the following deaths by natural causes must be reported under this AFI:
       1.4.17.1. An aircrew member during flight.
       1.4.17.2. A missile crewmember on alert.
       1.4.17.3. A combat support and training related death.
   1.4.18. Death or injury resulting directly from the illegal use of drugs or other substance
   abuse.
   1.4.19. Attempted or consummated suicide or intentionally self-inflicted injuries.
   1.4.20. Injuries resulting from minimum stress and strain (simple, natural, and nonviolent
   body positions or actions, as in dressing, sleeping, coughing, or sneezing). Those are injuries
   unrelated to mishap-producing agents or environments normally associated with active
   participation in daily work or recreation. Note: These injuries may be recordable IAW 29
   CFR 1904 and AFI 91-204, paragraph 1.13.4.
   1.4.21. Injury or illness to foreign nationals working for the AF as indirect hire personnel.
   1.4.22. Injuries associated with non-occupational diseases, when the disease, not the injury,
   is the proximate cause of the lost time, such as diabetes and its resultant complications like
   loss of vision; but not including complications of the injury (such as the infection of a cut
   aggravated by a work-related activity) that result in lost time.
   1.4.23. Injuries resulting from altercations, attack, or assault, unless injuries of this type were
   incurred in the performance of official duties. Injuries resulting from these events require
   recording on the OSHA Log 300 (see paragraph 1.13.4.)
1.5. Work-Relatedness. You must consider an injury or illness to be work-related if an event
or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition or
significantly aggravated a pre-existing injury or illness. Work-relatedness is presumed for
injuries and illnesses resulting from events or exposures occurring in the work environment,
unless an exception in 29 CFR 1904.5(b)(2) specifically applies.
   1.5.1. Injuries or illnesses will not be considered work-related if, at the time of the injury or
   illness, the employee was present in the work environment as a member of the general public
   rather than as an employee.
   1.5.2. Injuries or illnesses will not be considered work-related if they involve symptoms that
   surface at work but result solely from a non-work-related event or exposure that occurs
   outside the work environment.
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                              13


   1.5.3. Injuries and illnesses will not be considered work-related if they are solely the result
   of employees doing personal tasks (unrelated to their employment) at the work establishment
   outside of their assigned working hours.
   1.5.4. Injuries and illnesses will not be considered work-related if they are solely the result
   of personal grooming, self-medication for a non-work-related condition, or are intentionally
   self-inflicted.
   1.5.5. Common colds and flu will not be considered work-related even if contracted while
   the employee was at work. However, in the case of other infectious diseases such as
   tuberculosis, brucellosis, and hepatitis C, employers must evaluate reports of such illnesses
   for work relationship, just as they would any other type of injury or illness.
   1.5.6. Mental illness will not be considered work-related unless the employee voluntarily
   provides the employer with an opinion from a physician or other licensed health care
   professional with appropriate training and experience (psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric
   nurse practitioner, etc.) stating that the employee has a mental illness that is work-related.
   1.5.7. Injuries or illnesses will not be considered work-related if they are solely the result of
   an employee eating, drinking, or preparing food or drink for personal consumption (whether
   bought on the employer's premises or brought in). For example, if the employee is injured by
   choking on a sandwich while in the employer's establishment, the case would not be
   considered work-related. Note: 1. Injuries and illness of this nature that are experienced by
   military members will be reported as off-duty mishaps. 2. If the employee is made ill by
   ingesting food contaminated by workplace contaminants (such as lead), or gets food
   poisoning from food supplied by the employer, the case would be considered work-related.
1.6. Acting on Critical Safety Information. If safety personnel or investigators discover
information that seriously impacts the operations of a weapons system, the continuation of an
exercise, or other operations, they must immediately notify the CA by telephone and follow up
with a confirming e-mail, regardless of whether such information is associated with a mishap
currently under investigation. CA Safety Offices will take action IAW paragraph 2.6.7.
1.7. Accounting for Losses. The Air Force records each mishap to the MAJCOM that
experienced the loss or a majority of the loss of an owned asset (personnel or property). For
statistical purposes, the occurrence is recorded as a mishap in that command (or in the Air Force
at Large, when applicable) regardless of any determination as to the responsibility for the
mishap. Generally, the mishap is recorded in the command that has investigative responsibility
for the mishap (Chapter 4). Mishap accounting in no way implies blame or mishap
responsibility.
   1.7.1. For all engine-confined Domestic Object Damage (DOD) mishaps, the mishap
   accounting organization is assigned to the “Air Force at Large.”
   1.7.2. Record a military or civilian injury/loss to the command the individual is assigned to
   at the time of a mishap. Use military personnel data records and civilian payroll records to
   make determinations. Air Reserve Component (ARC) personnel who are activated under
   Title 10 of the U.S. Code are accounted to their parent unit.
 14                                               AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


   1.7.3. Record a mishap occurring to an individual in any permanent change of station (PCS)
   status to the losing command until the individual signs in at the new duty station. The
   “transfer effective date” is not criteria for determining the unit of assignment.
   1.7.4. Record a mishap involving an individual in PCS status with temporary duty pending
   further orders to the organization originating the initial orders until the individual signs in at
   the next permanent duty station.
   1.7.5. Record mishaps involving foreign exchange students and military members in non-
   pay status while awaiting an appellate review (appellate leave) or court martial to the Air
   Force at Large. For mishap reporting purposes, personnel in a non-pay status are returned to
   active duty when notified (written or verbal) to return to an Air Force installation.
   1.7.6. When a unit makes an Air Force Government Motor Vehicle (GMV) or Government
   Vehicle Other (GVO) available to another unit on a recurring or permanent dispatch, the
   using organization is the owning command. Vehicles assigned to non-appropriate units are
   not considered GMV or GVO.
Note: Vehicles on receipt to, and operated by, non-DoD persons or agencies and activities such
as the U.S. Postal Service or the American Red Cross are not GMVs.
   1.7.7. For all mishaps and incidents, ensure the unit’s/member’s home station safety office
   (and deployed safety representative, if applicable) is notified and receives all pertinent
   information as soon as possible.
1.8. Mishap Categories. The Air Force categorizes mishaps based upon the material involved
(e.g., space systems, weapons, aircraft, motor vehicles, etc.) and the state of the involved
material (e.g., launch, orbit, existence of intent for flight, on- or off-duty, etc.) when the mishap
occurs. Mishap categories and subcategories are defined below and diagramed in Figure 1.1.
For the purposes of reporting and data collection, select the one category and subcategory that
best defines the mishap under investigation using the order of precedence in paragraph 1.8.1.
Normally mishaps involve only one category and subcategory (see paragraph 1.8.3.).
1.8. (AFGSC)Mishap Categories. Categorization according to this instruction does not dictate
who investigates particular mishaps and under what specific guidance they are reported. For
instance, engine test cell mishaps are sub-categorized as industrial mishaps in the Ground and
Industrial mishap category; however, it may be more appropriate for a Jet Engine Mishap
Investigation Course (JEMIC) trained flight safety officer/NCO to investigate and report them
through the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS). Chief of Safety (CoS) discretion will
be utilized to ensure the proper personnel are used to investigate mishaps and events, however
the investigation will be conducted using the applicable AFMAN 91-22X guidance and
procedures. Sub-scale remotely piloted vehicle mishaps are categorized as aviation mishaps; and
should be normally investigated as such. However, if they do meet the mishap criteria for dollar
cost threshold or personnel injury in AFI 91-204 they should be investigated IAW AFI 99-151,
Air Launched Munition Analysis Group (ALMAG) guidelines.
   1.8.1. Specific Mishap Categories.

        reportable damage to the DoD aircraft itself, but the mishap involves a fatality,
        reportable injury, or reportable property damage. Parachuting injuries fall under this
        subcategory (refer to paragraph 4.4. and Attachment 8 for mishaps involving multiple
        services). A missile or RPA/UAV that is launched from a DoD aircraft, departs
        without damaging the aircraft, and is subsequently involved in a DoD mishap is
        reportable as a guided missile mishap or RPA/UAV mishap, respectively.
        1.8.1.3.3. Aviation Ground Operations (AGO) mishap. Any mishap that involves
        DoD aircraft with no intent for flight that results in reportable damage, injury, or
        fatality is an AGO mishap. All AGO mishaps will be investigated using AFMAN 91-
        223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports, guidance and procedures. These
        investigations will be cross-categorized as Ground, Industrial, and Occupational
        mishaps.
           1.8.1.3.3.1. Damage to a missile prior to the completion of weapons upload

        mishaps.
        1.8.1.5.2. Sports, Recreation, and Individual Fitness. An afloat mishap associated
        with an activity that requires physical exertion and skill that is governed by a set of
        rules or customs and often undertaken competitively and/or refreshes one’s mind or
        body through activity that amuses or stimulates. Involves the activity of exerting
        muscles in various ways to keep fit through the performance of exercise. This
        includes all fitness activities that do not meet the criteria for command-directed or
        organized fitness programs.
        1.8.1.5.3. Combat Support and Training. An afloat mishap associated with a non-
        combat military exercise or training activity designed to develop a military member's
        physical ability, maintain or increase individual or collective combat and
        peacekeeping skills, and is due to either a mishap or the result of natural causes when
        the medical event occurs during or within 1 hour after any training activity where the
        exercise or activity could be a contributing factor. This includes all training
        activities, including command-directed or compulsory physical fitness training, which
        do not meet the definition or are not included as values in sports, recreations, and
        individual fitness. The cause of death must be attributed to the mandatory physical
        exercise as determined by a competent medical authority
        1.8.1.5.4. Miscellaneous. An afloat mishap not assigned to another subcategory.
     1.8.1.6. Motor Vehicle. An Air Force mishap involving the operation of a motorized
     land vehicle operated by Air Force personnel. An Air Force mishap involving the
     operation of a DoD-owned or leased motorized land vehicle by Air Force personnel while
     operationally controlled by a DoD component. The above are all categorized as motor
     vehicle mishaps. Fatalities or injuries to pedestrians or bicyclists involving moving
     motor vehicles are included in this category. This category does not include ground
     industrial and occupational mishaps such as injuries occurring while loading or
     unloading, mounting or dismounting a non-moving vehicle; cargo damaged by weather;
     or damage to a properly parked DoD vehicle, unless caused by an operating DoD vehicle.

 20                                              AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


          1.8.1.7.4. Miscellaneous. A ground mishap not assigned to another subcategory.
          Also included in this subcategory are reportable mishaps occurring while using a
          commercial carrier such as a commercial bus, airplane, or taxicab.
Figure 1.1. USAF Mishap categories. The following figure illustrates the mishap categories
IAW DoDI 6055.07, Mishap Notification, Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping and
amplified to further describe USAF mishap categories.




   1.8.2. Multiple Occurrence Mishaps. Damaging occurrences that happen in logical
   succession are considered to be a single mishap and will result in a single safety
   investigation, unless there is clearly no possible initiating or sustaining relationship between
   occurrences. For example, an emergency vehicle responding to a mishap that collides with
   another motor vehicle is a separate mishap. MAJCOM/SE should contact AF/SE for
   resolution of questions regarding whether occurrences constitute a single or separate
   mishaps.
   1.8.3. USAF Mishaps Involving Multiple Categories.                Occasionally mishaps have
   characteristics that relate to two or more mishap categories.                For the primary
   category/subcategory, the mishap must meet the category definition in its entirety. For
   mishaps that completely meet more than one category definition, use the hierarchy in
   paragraph 1.8. and Figure 1.1. to select the primary category, and select the other categories
   as cross-categories. If a mishap relates to a category definition, but does not completely meet
   the definition, up to two related cross-categories/subcategories may be selected. For
   example, a government vehicle that hits and damages an aircraft on the flightline would be
   categorized as an AGO mishap with motor vehicle as a cross category.
1.9. Non-USAF Mishaps. Periodically the Air Force investigates mishaps that do not fit the
definition of an Air Force mishap. The Air Force generally investigates non-USAF mishaps
because of an existing agreement with the involved party or because it has unique expertise or
interest in the mishap, and has agreed to lead an investigation. For example, the Air Force, by
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                             21


way of an existing Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU), may have previously agreed to investigate any mishap involving the equipment of a
foreign nation occurring on US soil. Non-USAF mishap categories are defined below and
diagramed in Figure 1.2. For the purposes of reporting and data collection, select the one
category that best defines the mishap under investigation. Note: Non-USAF mishaps fall into
one of three categories while USAF mishaps fall into one of seven DoD categories previously
discussed in paragraph 1.8. and diagramed in Figure 1.1.
   1.9.1. Non-USAF Aviation. Aviation mishaps involving:
       1.9.1.1. A non-DoD aircraft or non-DoD RPA/UAS, regardless of the existence of intent
       for flight, which only results in damage to non-USAF equipment or injury to non-USAF
       personnel. An Air Force pilot who is uninjured during a successful ejection from a
       foreign-owned, single-seat fighter that is subsequently destroyed is categorized as a non-
       USAF aviation mishap since there was no damage to Air Force equipment or injury to
       Air Force personnel. However, if the foreign-owned aircraft is leased by the DoD and is
       operated by AF personnel, it would be a USAF Aviation Flight Mishap.
       1.9.1.2. A DoD aircraft or DoD RPA/UAS, regardless of the existence of intent for
       flight, resulting in damage or injury to the Air Force (paragraph 1.3.1.1.) and another
       DoD component is responsible for reporting. An Air Force person killed in an aircraft
       belonging to another DoD component typically would be investigated and reported by the
       DoD component owning the aircraft. However, if the Air Force wrote its own limited
       report, usually to document and report the loss of life, it would be categorized as a non-
       USAF aviation mishap.
   1.9.2. Contractor. Instances where contractor operations on government property during the
   execution of a government contract result in significant damage to contractor-owned
   equipment or injury to contract employees but not reportable damage to DoD property or
   injury to DoD personnel.
   1.9.3. Other. Mishaps that do not fit into the non-USAF aviation or contractor categories.

Figure 1.2. Non-USAF Mishap categories.




1.10. Mishap and Event Classifications. Classify mishaps by total direct mishap cost and the
severity of injury/occupational illness. Exception: Classify Class E events according to the
definitions below. Calculate direct cost of a mishap IAW paragraph 1.11. On initial response,
use the highest reasonably-expected cost estimate to determine the mishap class and downgrade
if additional cost information indicates a lower class is warranted. Note: Severity of
injury/occupational illness, not injury/occupational cost, is used to classify mishaps.
   1.10.1. Class A Mishap. A mishap resulting in one or more of the following:
       1.10.1.1. Direct mishap cost totaling $2,000,000 or more.
22                                               AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


     1.10.1.2. A fatality or permanent total disability.
     1.10.1.3. Destruction of a DoD aircraft (Attachment 1). Note: A destroyed Group 1, 2,
     or 3 RPA/UAS is not a Class A mishap unless the criteria in paragraphs 1.10.1.1. or
     1.10.1.2. are met.
     1.10.1.4. Permanent loss of primary mission capability of a space vehicle.
  1.10.2. Class B Mishap. A mishap resulting in one or more of the following:
     1.10.2.1. Direct mishap cost totaling $500,000 or more but less than $2,000,000.
     1.10.2.2. A permanent partial disability.
     1.10.2.3. Inpatient hospitalization of three or more personnel. Do not count or include
     individuals hospitalized for observation, diagnostic, or administrative purposes that were
     treated and released.
     1.10.2.4. Permanent degradation of primary or secondary mission capability of a space
     vehicle or the permanent loss of secondary mission capability of a space vehicle.
  1.10.3. Class C Mishap. A mishap resulting in one or more of the following:
     1.10.3.1. Direct mishap cost totaling $50,000 or more but less than $500,000.
     1.10.3.2. Any injury or occupational illness that causes loss of one or more days away
     from work not including the day or shift it occurred. When determining if the mishap is a
     Lost Time Case, you must count the number of days the employee was unable to work as
     a result of the injury or illness, regardless of whether the person was scheduled to work
     on those days. Weekend days, holidays, vacation days, or other days off are included in
     the total number of days, if the employee would not have been able to work on those
     days.
     1.10.3.3. An occupational injury or illness resulting in permanent change of job.
     1.10.3.4. Permanent loss or degradation of tertiary mission capability of a space vehicle.
  1.10.4. Class D Mishap. A mishap resulting in one or more of the following:
     1.10.4.1. Direct mishap cost totaling $20,000 or more but less than $50,000.
     1.10.4.2. Any mishap resulting in a recordable injury or illness not otherwise classified
     as a Class A, B, or C mishap. These are cases where, because of injury or occupational
     illness, the employee only works partial days, has restricted duties (does not include
     medical restriction from flying or special operational duties (DNIF) by AF Form 1042) or
     was transferred to another job, required medical treatment greater than first aid, or
     experienced loss of consciousness (does not include GLOC). In addition, a significant
     injury (e.g. fractured/cracked bone, punctured eardrum) or occupational illness (e.g.
     occupational cancer (mesothelioma), chronic irreversible disease (beryllium disease))
     diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care professional must be reported even
     if it does not result in death, days away from work, restricted work, job transfer, medical
     treatment greater than first aid, or loss of consciousness. Note: Occurrences that result
     from voluntary participation in wellness and fitness programs, or recreational activities
     such as exercise class, racquetball, or baseball will be reported to comply with DoDI
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                           23


       6055.07, Mishap Notification, Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping, Enclosure
       6, Tables 5 & 6, and Enclosure 8.
   1.10.5. Class E Events. Certain occurrences do not meet reportable mishap classification
   criteria, but are deemed important to investigate/report for hazard identification and mishap
   prevention. Class E reports provide an expeditious way to disseminate valuable mishap
   prevention information. Findings and recommendations for Class E events are optional.
   MAJCOMs and host installation chiefs of safety will determine depth of reporting in AFSAS.
   See specific AFMAN 91-22X for Class E categories.
1.11. Mishap Costs. It is DoD policy to determine the total direct mishap cost in order to
provide a factual basis for the allocation of resources in support of DoD mishap prevention
programs. Direct mishap costs ONLY include property damage costs (DoD and Non-DoD),
associated repair labor costs, and environmental cleanup costs. The direct cost does not include
the cost of implementing corrective actions. All other costs (e.g., investigation and
transportation costs) are indirect costs. Report costs that would have been charged to the
government if the Air Force was reimbursed or if the repair was accomplished under warranty.
   1.11.1. Determining DoD Property Damage Costs. This includes damage or loss of material
   and the cost of labor to repair material. See DoDI 6055.07, Mishap Notification,
   Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping, for detailed costing information.
   1.11.1. (AFGSC) Mishap Costs. Mishap units will document as much detailed damage
   information as possible to obtain an accurate and timely repair cost estimate, expedite
   identification and mishap classification, and facilitate meeting investigation/reporting
   requirements. For engine mishaps with suspected internal damage, units will conduct a
   borescope inspection and document damage to the maximum extent possible. The use of
   Failure Analysis Service Technology (FAST) testing is encouraged when warranted.
       1.11.1.1. Field Level Repair.
           1.11.1.1.1. Materiel Cost. If an item is repaired locally by unit personnel, calculate
           the cost of the materiel used to repair the item.
           1.11.1.1.2. DoD Labor Costs (DoD military and civilian personnel). Determine the
           number of hours of labor to repair the damaged materiel. Obtain the field level
           hourly rate from the AFSEC Portal Website or contact AFSEC technical support for
           assistance. To calculate the labor rates for safety reporting, multiply the number of
           hours of labor expended by DoD personnel by the hourly rate.
           1.11.1.1.3. Contractor Repairs. Use the actual cost charged to the government for
           repairs performed by contractors. If the contractor considers itemized costs to be
           proprietary information, request and report only the sum total. Contact the Program
           Manager (PM) for assistance in obtaining contractor repair costs.
           1.11.1.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) Modifications/Upgrades. Include the cost to repair
           damaged materiel even if the items are scheduled to be modified by an upgrade
           program in the future. Calculate the repair costs IAW appropriate repair level.
       1.11.1.2. Depot Level Repair.
           1.11.1.2.1. Materiel. Obtain the exchange cost for each stock listed item requiring
           depot level repair from the Air Force Master Item Identification Data Base (D043A).
24                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


         If the item is not stock listed, contact the PM. If the sum total of the exchange costs
         is equal to or greater than $500,000, obtain an estimated cost of repair based upon
         actual damage from the depot/repair facility. Report this estimated cost. If the
         depot/repair facility cannot provide an estimated cost of repair based upon actual
         damage, revert to using exchange cost from D043A. If the sum total of the exchange
         costs is less than $500,000 report this cost. The Logistics Readiness Squadron
         Material Management Customer Support Section has access to D043A. Exception:
         If the sum total of the exchange costs for FOD is equal to or greater than $500,000, a
         depot/repair facility estimated cost based on field damage description may be
         reported.
         1.11.1.2.2. Depot Labor Costs. Determine the number of hours of labor to repair the
         damaged materiel. Obtain the depot level hourly rate from the AFSEC portal website
         or contact AFSEC technical support for assistance. Multiply the number of hours of
         labor expended by depot personnel by the hourly rate.
         1.11.1.2.3. Contractor Repairs. Use the actual cost charged to the government for
         repairs performed by contractors. If the contractor considers itemized costs to be
         proprietary information, request and report only the sum total. Contact the PM for
         assistance in obtaining contractor repair costs.
         1.11.1.2.4. (Added-AFGSC) Modifications/Upgrades. Include the cost to repair
         damaged materiel even if the items are scheduled to be modified by an upgrade
         program in the future. Calculate the repair costs IAW appropriate repair level.
  1.11.2. Destroyed Assets.
     1.11.2.1. Determining destroyed conventional/aircraft RPA/UAS cost.            If the
     aircraft/RPA/UAS is destroyed, obtain flyaway cost from the Air Force Cost Analysis
     Agency (AFCAA/FMS) at DSN 986-5416 or Commercial 937-656-5416. Contact the
     PM to get the cost of all modifications done to the aircraft/RPA/UAS up to the mishap
     date. Note: An aircraft/RPA/UAS that is damaged but will not be repaired is not
     automatically a destroyed aircraft/RPA/UAS. In this case, calculate repair cost IAW
     paragraphs 1.11.1.1. and/or 1.11.1.2.
     1.11.2.2. Other destroyed or lost assets with no item to exchange. Use the standard
     (unit) cost from D043A or the PM. The Logistics Readiness Squadron Material
     Management Customer Support Section has access to D043A.
  1.11.3. Determining Costs to Non-DoD Property Damage. If Air Force operations result in
  damage of non-DoD property, calculate and report the damage cost. Determine non-DoD
  property damage costs using official estimates from agencies such as, but not limited to,
  logistics readiness offices or licensed/credentialed estimators.
  1.11.4. Determining Environmental Clean-Up Costs. Obtain these costs from the local civil
  engineering environmental section. The end cost of this type of clean up may not be
  available inside the normal 30-day investigation timeframe. Use the best estimate available
  at the time of the final message. Environmental clean-up costs include costs for:
     1.11.4.1. Clean up.
     1.11.4.2. Environmental decontamination.
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                             25


       1.11.4.3. Restoration of private and government property.
1.12. Mishap Injury, Occupational Illnesses, and Property Damage. Report the type of
person (paragraph 1.12.1.) and the severity of injury/occupational illness (paragraph 1.12.2.)
and/or the severity of property damage (paragraph 1.12.3.). MAJCOMs will ensure units use the
AF Form 978, Supervisors Mishap Report, for this documentation. Mishaps involving an Air
Force Foreign National (AFFN) employee who is a direct hire will be investigated and reported
via AFSAS. Indirect hire employee mishaps will normally be investigated by the host nation
safety office. However, the applicable Air Force safety office will work with the host nation
safety office to ensure violations or hazards that are identified as causal are corrected.
   1.12.1. Type of person. Rated officer, nonrated officer, enlisted, cadet, DoD civilian, DoD
   contractor, foreign national, or non-DoD civilian. Note: Foreign nationals include military
   (rated or non-rated) officer, military enlisted, or civilian.
   1.12.2. Severity of injury or occupational illnesses. Includes fatality, permanent total
   disability, permanent partial disability, lost time case, or no lost time case (see Attachment
   1). For lost time cases, also report the number of days hospitalized and the number of days
   of lost time beyond the days hospitalized. In cases when the actual number of days
   hospitalized or lost time is not known at the time the safety report is submitted, the best
   official estimates made by a competent medical authority will be used.
   1.12.3. Severity of property damage. Includes facilities, equipment, property, materiel, or
   resources. If the occurrence meets mishap reporting criteria, then the cost of environmental
   cleanup shall be included in property damage costs.
1.13. Recording Injuries and Occupational Illnesses. Use AFSAS to create the OSHA Form
300, Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses, for recording injuries and occupational illnesses
to civilian and military personnel meeting Class A, B, C, or D criteria. See AFMAN 91-224,
Ground Safety Investigations and Reports, Chapter 6, for specific guidance.
   1.13.1. Contractor employees hired by the Air Force via a non-personal services contract, as
   defined by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.101, are under the contractor’s day-to-
   day supervision. The contractor, not the Air Force, will be responsible for reporting
   contractor injuries and illnesses to OSHA, even if the contractor’s employees are co-located
   with an Air Force organization.
   1.13.2. Contractor employees hired under a personal services contract, as defined by FAR
   37.104, are under the day-to-day supervision of the government and its employees. The Air
   Force will be responsible for reporting injuries of these contractor employees.
   1.13.3. If uncertain as to the type of contract employee, contact the Contracting Officer.
   1.13.4. OSHA Recordable Event inputs in AFSAS are driven by 29 CFR 1904, OSHA
   Recording and Reporting Occupational Injuries. These are injuries incurred that are duty
   related and required by OSHA to be recorded, but are not required to be reported by DoD or
   USAF safety guidance. The following are examples: Workplace Violence, Terrorist Act,
   and Minimum Stress and Strain injuries. When all information is loaded into AFSAS, the
   system will automatically populate the OSHA 300 Log.
 26                                              AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


       1.13.4.1. Workplace Violence. Injuries and illness that resulted from any act of physical
       violence, (e.g., physical assaults, homicide, or disruptive behavior) that occurred at the
       work site.
       1.13.4.2. Terrorist Act. Injuries and illness that resulted from a terrorist event or
       exposure in the work environment (e.g. release of anthrax) are considered work-related
       for OSHA recordkeeping purposes.
1.14. Obtaining and Using Health Information.
   1.14.1. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). DoD
   Regulation 6025.18-R, DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation, implements Public Law
   104-191, HIPAA within the DoD. DoDI 6055.07, Mishap Notification, Investigation,
   Reporting, and Record Keeping, governs the protection, use, and release of safety records.
   Mishap investigation and reporting requires acquisition of protected health information from
   the medical community.
       1.14.1.1. Safety officials at all levels are responsible for establishing a liaison with
       installation medical agencies to ensure an information flow has been established (see
       paragraph 2.3.). DoD Regulation 6025.18-R permits a covered entity to make a use or
       disclosure of protected health information as required by law. Safety personnel should
       consult AFSEC/JA or AFSEC/SEH for questions on subsequent release.
       1.14.1.2. The safety investigation board (SIB) process and members, to include
       appointed medical members and human factors additional members, function under the
       auspices of this AFI and are not “covered entities” under HIPAA. As such, once the SIB
       receives health information from a covered entity the information ceases to be protected
       by HIPAA, but remains subject to the Privacy Act as personally identifiable information
       (PII). The SIB shall protect PII with prudent safeguards to prevent unauthorized release.
       Medical personnel assigned to the SIB shall inform interviewees HIPAA does not apply,
       but that safeguards are in place to protect PII.
   1.14.2. The requirement to comply with HIPAA applies only to individuals or organizations
   meeting the definition of a covered entity. A covered entity may use or disclose protected
   health information as authorized by the individual to whom the information pertains, or as
   otherwise permitted by DoD 6025.18-R. HIPAA does not preclude an employee from
   providing medical information to their supervisor, management, or the installation
   Compensation Program Administrator. For questions on medical information release,
   medical personnel should consult DoD Regulation 6025.18-R paragraph DL1.1.31 and the
   servicing Medical Law Consultant.
   1.14.3. The appropriate level Compensation Program Administrator, deemed by the AFPC
   Injury Compensation Office, will provide injury and illness information to the host
   installation safety offices in a prompt fashion using appropriate, secure electronic systems
   such as Safety and Fitness Electronic Records (SaFER).
1.15. Delegation. Unless specifically prohibited, all DoDI 6055.07, Mishap Notification,
Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping, safety responsibilities assigned to the Secretary of
the Air Force are delegated to the Air Force Chief of Safety.
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                           27

         2.4.6.1.4. A record of mishaps involving other DoD resources will be forwarded to
         the involved agencies with an information copy to AF/SE. This record includes all
         mishap information.
         2.4.6.1.5. When a mishap involves a contract managed by the Defense Contract
         Management Agency (DCMA), DCMA safety personnel will review the final
         message safety report and send their response back to AFSEC (paragraphs 7.3. and
         7.3.3.).
         2.4.6.1.6. The contractors and subcontractors will immediately comply with required
         toxicology testing and provide required medical information/records to the Medical
         Officer in the event of an Air Force mishap.
  2.4.7. Ensure contract/lease agreements for aerospace vehicles state: “The Air Force is
  responsible for the investigation of mishaps involving aerospace vehicles. The Air Force is
  authorized to investigate mishaps involving non-accepted Air Force aerospace vehicles.”

      2.6.7.4. Forward to AFSEC/SEF as quickly as practical all critical safety information
      related to military variants of civil aircraft and commercial off-the-shelf aircraft and
      equipment. AFSEC/SEF will ensure all such information contributing to the promotion
      of aviation safety is forwarded to the Administrator of the FAA and/or the Chairperson of
      the NTSB for appropriate action.
2.7. The Commander of the Active Duty Air Force installation to include Air Force led
Joint Bases nearest a mishap (or alternate organization as designated by the CA) will:
   2.7.1. Respond to a mishap involving DoD assets IAW AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency
   Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations and AFMAN 10-2504, Air Force
   Incident Management Guidance for Major Accidents and Natural Disasters.
   2.7.2. Provide logistical and investigative support as required. Air Reserve Component
   (ARC) installations, if nearest the mishap, will respond with available resources to the
   maximum extent possible, in coordination with the responding active duty installation. Note:
   When mishap response and SIB support MOAs/MOUs between active duty and ARC units
   are established, they will be initiated by the active duty installation and maintained by the
   MAJCOM/SE, HQ AFRC/SE, and NGB/SE. In cases where airfields are predominantly
   non-Air Force, logistical and investigative support would be applicable to the commander of
   an active duty Air Force Wing with an SE office nearest the mishap. Contingency funds may
   be available to reimburse the shipping agency that handles evidence for a mishap that
   occurred while supporting a contingency operation. To ensure reimbursement the shipping
   agency must use the appropriate emergency and special program code based on its
   MAJCOM and the area of responsibility (AOR).
   2.7.3. Appoint an Interim Safety Board (ISB) to preserve evidence and gather factual data
   related to the mishap until the CA appointed safety investigation board or single investigating
   officer can conduct an investigation. Depending on the mishap, an ISB may consist of one
   individual or several depending on the judgment of the installation commander.
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                          31


     2.7.3.1. In the event of fatalities, great care must be taken to ensure a positive chain of
     custody for all human remains. If any chain of custody issues arise, contact the CA
     immediately.
     2.7.3.2. Do not appoint personnel involved in the mishap to the ISB.
  2.7.4. Ensure toxicology testing is immediately accomplished following a mishap, if
  required or deemed necessary. Evidence gathering and toxicology testing should be balanced
  with operational requirements. For example, during RPA/UAS scenarios where one crew is
  controlling multiple vehicles, operational need may delay replacement of the crew and
  toxicology testing until remaining vehicles are safely recovered. A legally defensible chain
  of custody must be maintained. At a minimum, direct observation and documentation of the
  sample collection (i.e., name of observer, date/time of collection) should be maintained by
  the submitting base. Guidelines for the collection and shipment of specimens for
  toxicological analysis are available at http://www.afmes.mi l/. Toxicological analyses
  should be directed toward controlled substances, any medications as indicated by the medical
  history, and environmental substances (such as carbon monoxide) as indicated by the nature
  of the mishap or event. Samples should be sent to the Armed Forces Medical Examiner
  System (AFMES), Division of Forensic Toxicology (see Attachment 2) to the maximum
  extent possible. Blood testing is superior and the preferred method for all categories of
  safety investigations over urine testing since it provides an opportunity to determine the
  concentration of the substance and thus the expected performance decrement. Also, not all
  substances are excreted in the urine. Coordinate with the Civilian Personnel Office or
  Contracting Officer before requiring blood samples from DoD civilian or contractor
  employees, since they may only be required to complete a urinalysis.
     2.7.4.1. Military Members. For all Class A and B aviation mishaps, commanders must
     test all military crewmembers on the flight orders (see paragraph 2.7.4.1.1. for RPA
     exceptions). For all on-duty Class A and B mishaps, commanders must test all military
     members in primary control of the involved equipment or environment; including on-
     scene instructors if a student is involved. For all classes and categories of mishaps,
     commanders have the discretion to test any additional involved military members whose
     actions or inactions, in their judgment, may have been factors in the mishap sequence.
     Because the evidence is perishable, commanders should test all involved personnel (see
     paragraph 2.7.4.1.1. for RPA exceptions) for aviation mishaps that have the potential of
     meeting the Class B threshold. When ARC personnel are involved in a mishap,
     coordinate with the ARC unit commander and/or AFRC/NGB SE offices to resolve any
     issues that may arise due to duty status issues (i.e., ARC personnel flying in civilian or
     Inactive Duty for Training status). Blood will be used for toxicological testing of
     military members for aviation safety investigations and is the preferred method for all
     safety investigations.
         2.7.4.1.1. Toxicology testing of military crewmembers involved in a Class A or B
         RPA/UAS mishap is mandatory only for the crew or crews (including instructors or
         evaluators performing “over the shoulder” duties) which operated the aircraft during
         and immediately preceding the mishap sequence. This is defined as the last two
         crews to operate the aircraft. Additionally, toxicology testing is mandatory for any
         technician who performed maintenance on the ground control station or aircraft
         during this period.
32                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


         2.7.4.1.2. Directed medical examinations and 72-hour/7-day histories of
         crewmembers involved in a Class A or B RPA/UAS mishap are only mandatory for
         the RPA/UAS crew or crews (including instructors or evaluators performing “over
         the shoulder” duties) which operated the aircraft during and immediately preceding
         the mishap sequence. This is defined as the last two crews to operate the aircraft.
         Additionally, medical examinations and 72-hour/7-day histories are mandatory for
         any technician who performed maintenance on the ground control station during this
         period.
     2.7.4.2. DoD Civilians. DoD civilians will be subject to testing when their action or
     inaction may have contributed to the mishap. Coordinate with the Civilian Personnel
     Office to assist as needed.
     2.7.4.3. Government Contract Employees. Government Contract Employees (includes
     RPA/UAS crew) will be tested by consent or IAW the terms and conditions of the
     applicable contract, when their actions or inaction in the commander's judgment may
     have been a factor in the mishap sequence. Coordinate with the Contracting Office to
     assist as needed.
     2.7.4.4. (Added-AFGSC) For all Class A and B weapons mishaps, commanders must
     test all members in the mishap chain, who in the commander’s judgment may have been a
     factor in the mishap sequence. Because evidence is perishable, commanders should have
     toxicology tests performed on all involved personnel for weapons mishaps that have the
     potential of meeting the Class B threshold. When ARC personnel are involved in a
     mishap, coordinate with the ARC unit commander and/or AFRC/NGB SE offices to
     resolve any issues that may arise due to duty status issues (i.e., ARC personnel working
     in civilian or Inactive Duty for Training status). Blood will be used for toxicological
     testing of military members for weapons safety investigations and is the preferred method
     for all safety investigations. Whenever possible, coordinate all blood testing with HQ
     AFGSC/JA, prior to drawing blood.
  2.7.5. Ensure the appropriate military notifications are accomplished:
     2.7.5.1. When requested by public affairs (PA) office for mishap information, ensure
     only non-privileged information is released. Release safety information only as
     authorized by this instruction.
     2.7.5.2. Notify the home installation commander of all casualties, both military and
     civilian, and ensure the casualties are reported as outlined in AFI 36-3002, Casualty
     Services.
     2.7.5.3. Notify the departure and destination bases for aviation mishaps (or the departure
     base for missile mishaps) and the commander of the unit that had the mishap.
     2.7.5.4. Notify the home installation of the persons involved in a United States Army,
     United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, or United States Coast Guard mishap
     or, if the home installation is unknown, the nearest installation of the responsible service.

     2.7.5.6. Notify the Air Force Space Command’s Hammer Adaptive Communications
     Element (ACE) if communications support is deemed necessary. Hammer ACE is
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                               33


       funded to provide services to safety investigations at no cost to MAJCOMs or Air Force
       wings.
       2.7.5.7. Notify the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command’s Defense
       Transportation Tracking System (Attachment 2) when a mishap involves explosives or
       other dangerous articles being transported or handled by a commercial motor or rail
       carrier under Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations.
       2.7.5.8. Notify local Command Post (Command Post may have reporting requirements
       IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting). The responding Air Force installation safety
       office should coordinate with the Command Post on OPREPs generated as a result of a
       mishap to ensure no inaccurate or privileged information is released.
       2.7.5.9. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/SE notification. Safety staffs will make a
       notification to HQ AFGSC/SE via telephone and email for possible Class A mishaps and
       via email for possible Class B mishaps and exposure to toxic/caustic materials or
       propellants (Attachment 9). During non-duty hours contact HQ AFGSC/SE through the
       HQ AFGSC Command Post. Do not delay reporting for lack of complete information;
       provide an advisory that the information is not yet complete. A courtesy copy will be
       sent to the applicable NAF/SE.
   2.7.6. In the United States, ensure the appropriate civilian notifications are accomplished:
       2.7.6.1. Notify the nearest NTSB regional or field office or the nearest FAA Air Traffic
       facility if a civil aircraft is involved in a mishap on their installation (see contact
       information in AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports).
       2.7.6.2. Notify the FAA Office of Commercial Space Transportation (FAA/AST)
       Combined Operations Center (Attachment 2) if licensed commercial space systems are
       involved in the mishap. During launch of a commercial space vehicle from an Air Force
       facility, the on-site FAA/AST representative will fulfill this notification requirement and
       up-channel as required.
       2.7.6.3. Notify the nearest OSHA area or regional office within 8 hours of an on-duty
       mishap when the mishap results in an Air Force civilian employee fatality, to include
       heart attack victims, or involves the inpatient hospitalization of three or more people (one
       of which must be a DoD civilian employee). If unable to contact the nearest OSHA area
       or regional office within the required 8-hour time frame, contact the OSHA 24-hour toll-
       free hot line (Attachment 2). Although outside OSHA’s investigative jurisdiction,
       overseas locations are required to notify AFSEC/SEG of these types of incidents.
       2.7.6.4. Notify federal, state, and local environmental officials, as required, of
       environmental hazards and spills associated with the mishap.
       2.7.6.5. Notify appropriate medical or law enforcement authorities as soon as possible in
       case of non-Air Force injury or property damage.
   2.7.7. (Added-AFGSC) Assist the ISB to ensure all equipment associated with the mishap
   is impounded and turned over to the formal SIB.
2.8. The Interim Safety Board (ISB) President or Investigating Officer will:
   2.8.1. Preserve evidence.

   2.8.3. Gather factual data.
   2.8.4. Receive a briefing from the on-scene commander/incident commander/recovery
   operations chief (ROC) on all known hazards (including bloodborne pathogens) and
   personnel protective equipment requirements for the mishap site.
   2.8.5. Accept control of the wreckage and/or evidence, as applicable. The ISB President,
   Investigating Officer or Chief of Safety will not perform duties as ROC.
   2.8.6. Submit a non-privileged preliminary message within 24 hours in AFSAS.
2.9. The Commander of the mishap unit will: (applies when the mishap unit and the mishap
location are not co-located)
   2.9.1. Coordinate with the commander of the Air Force installation nearest to the mishap to
   ensure the appropriate notifications in paragraphs 2.7.5. and 2.7.6. are accomplished.
   2.9.2. Assist ISB as required/requested. For RPA/UAS mishaps, the commander of the
   mishap unit will appoint an ISB to complete initial data gathering and preserve evidence for
   the SIB.
   2.9.3. Ensure toxicology testing is performed IAW paragraph 2.7.4.
   2.9.4. (Added-AFGSC) Transition responsibility to the formal SIB or other investigating
   entity, if any is appointed. If no formal board or Single Investigation Officer (SIO) is
   activated, any accumulated evidence will ultimately be returned to the appropriate agency or
   disposed of.
2.10. Chiefs of Safety or Equivalent will:
   2.10.1. Ensure individuals with access to safety or mishap information, privileged or
   otherwise, know the limitations placed on their uses and are trained on the proper procedures
   for protecting such materials before receiving any safety or mishap information. Ensure
   individuals appointed to investigate mishaps are trained on the proper handling procedures of

       resolving any deficiencies falls on the Wing SE office. Wing SEs must coordinate to
       schedule individuals for the appropriate formal safety training courses (i.e., Board
       President Course (BPC), Aircraft Mishap Investigation Course (AMIC), JEMIC, Mishap
       Investigation Non-Aviation (MINA)) through the appropriate NAF/SE to AFGSC/SE
       unless otherwise noted. Unless otherwise noted, TDY funding for attendees is the
       responsibility of the individual’s unit.
2.11. The Deployed Unit Safety Officers (safety personnel deployed with DoD assets or an
established safety office overseas in an AOR) will:
   2.11.1. Gather evidence and initiate an AFSAS report. This office will coordinate with the
   appointed safety investigator to compile the mishap data that will be collected locally and
   forward it to the owning unit for mishap report completion.

                                             Chapter 3

                          PRIVILEGED SAFETY INFORMATION

3.1. General Information. Note: Safety privilege is based on a national defense need for
rapid and accurate assessment of the causes of mishaps to prevent a recurrence and
maintain mission readiness. This privilege creates restrictions on handling and releasing
information in safety investigation reports.
   3.1.1. Violations of the prohibitions in paragraph 3.3.1. of this instruction are punishable
   under Article 92, UCMJ and may be grounds for disciplinary actions according to civilian
   personnel regulations, or may lead to contract actions.
   3.1.2. Almost all safety reports contain privileged safety information, but not all information
   in a safety report is privileged. Preliminary messages, hazardous air traffic reports (HATRs),
   controlled movement area violation (CMAVs), wildlife strike Class E reports, and non-DoD
   aviation safety reports do not contain privileged safety information. In addition, ground
   category Industrial and Occupational, and weapons category Explosive and Chemical Agent
   safety reports for mishaps that occurred before 3 Oct 00 do not contain privileged safety
   information (paragraph 3.9.).
3.2. Identifying Privileged Safety Information. Privileged safety information refers to
information that is exempt by case law from disclosure outside the Air Force safety community.
The military safety privilege is judicially recognized and protects the investigative process. The
Air Force treats this information as limited use/limited access. Safety privilege assures
commanders obtain critical information expeditiously during a safety investigation and ensures
that completed final reports are protected, thereby proactively promoting safety, combat
readiness, and mission accomplishment.
   3.2.1. Privileged information includes:
       3.2.1.1. Findings, conclusions, causes, recommendations, other findings and
       recommendations of significance, analysis, and the deliberative process of safety
       investigators. Diagrams and exhibits are privileged if they contain information which
       depicts the analysis of safety investigators. This includes draft versions of the above
       material and notes taken by safety investigators in the course of their investigation,
       whether they are incorporated either directly or by reference, in the final safety report.
       (See paragraph 3.1.2. for exceptions).
       3.2.1.2. Information given to safety investigators pursuant to a promise of confidentiality
       and any information derived from that information to include direct or indirect references
       to that information (paragraph 3.4).
       3.2.1.3. Computer generated animations, simulations, or simulator reenactments in which
       safety investigator analysis or privileged testimony is incorporated. Animations made
       exclusively from recorder data (including Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance
       data) are not privileged. Note: Although not privileged, actual intra-cockpit voice
       communication has legal protection as private communication and any request for access
       must be coordinated through legal channels. Requests to any safety office for intra-
       cockpit voice communications should be directed to the AFSEC/JA.
 38                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


       3.2.1.4. Photographs, imagery, and animations that reveal the deliberative process of the
       board, including photographs with markings. However, photographs depicting a
       measuring device or object contracted against mishap evidence for the sole purpose of
       demonstrating the size or scale of the evidence are not considered privileged safety
       information.
       3.2.1.5. Life Sciences material that contain analysis by a safety or life sciences
       investigator. Note: 72-hour histories, 7-day histories and interview narratives are only
       privileged if a promise of confidentiality was granted.
3.3. Prohibited Uses of Privileged Safety Reports and Information. Privileged safety
information may only be released as provided elsewhere in this instruction or upon specific
authorization by the Secretary of Defense. The following prohibitions apply to Part 2 of formal
safety reports, status and final safety messages, and any other reports or documents containing
privileged safety information.
   3.3.1. Air Force civilian employees, military members, and government contractors will not
   wrongfully use, permit the use of, gain access to, or allow access to the privileged
   information in any safety report, or portions thereof, for other than officially authorized
   mishap prevention purposes.
   3.3.2. The Air Force does not use privileged safety information as evidence for punitive,
   disciplinary, or adverse administrative actions, for determining the misconduct or line-of-
   duty status of any person, in flying evaluation board hearings/reviews, to determine liability
   or liability in claims for or against the United States, or in any other manner as part of any
   action by or against the United States.
       3.3.2.1. Adverse administrative actions include, but are not limited to, letters of
       reprimand, counseling, or admonishment, referral EPRs/OPRs, promotion propriety
       actions (not qualified for promotion, delay and/or denial), administrative separations,
       selective reenlistment denials, or evidence before any evaluation board and other similar
       actions. Commanders and supervisors will use other sources of information which are
       not privileged to take punitive or adverse administrative actions.
       3.3.2.2. While privileged safety information may not be used as evidence for punitive,
       disciplinary, or adverse administrative actions, information from other sources may be
       used. Sources include information from AIB reports under AFI 51-503, Aerospace
       Accident Investigations and AFI 51-507, Ground Accident Investigations, safety mishap
       participant interviews when promises of confidentiality are not authorized (Article 31,
       UCMJ, rights advisement may be necessary), Security Forces and/or AFOSI information
       gathered for criminal matters. Consult your local JA for further guidance on the use of
       information from legal investigations.
       3.3.2.3. The Air Force does not release privileged safety information in response to:
          3.3.2.3.1. Requests pursuant to DoD 5400.7-R and Title 5, United States Code,
          section 552, DoD Freedom of Information Act (also known and hereinafter referred to
          as “FOIA”).
              3.3.2.3.1.1. Send FOIA requests for all safety reports to AFSEC/JA (Attachment
              2).
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                             39


   3.3.3. Controlling and Handling Safety Reports and Information. Personnel having access
   (both authorized and unauthorized access) to privileged safety reports and information have a
   duty to control the reports to prevent their use for anything other than mishap prevention.
   When these reports and information are no longer needed for mishap prevention purposes,
   dispose of IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).
       3.3.3.1. All requests for release of safety reports and information outside of Air Force
       safety channels should be immediately forwarded to AFSEC/JA. Exception: Transfer of
       information to a corresponding legal investigation upon completion of a safety
       investigation.
       3.3.3.2. All persons (except the CA, their staff, safety office staff, and AFSEC
       personnel) given or provided access to privileged safety information by the ISB or SIB
       prior to the CA briefing must have a Safety Investigation Non-Disclosure Agreement,
       Witness Promise of Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement, or Promise of
       Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement for Contractor Representatives Serving as
       Technical Experts to Safety Investigations (See Attachment 3 for examples) on file with
       the ISB or SIB.
3.4. Promise of Confidentiality.
   3.4.1. Purpose. The Air Force gives a promise of confidentiality to encourage frank and
   open communication with individuals who provide witness statements to a safety investigator
   and with government contractors who built, designed, or maintained the equipment and
   participate in the safety investigation. However, if an individual provides a false statement to
   a safety investigator under a promise of confidentiality, that statement (and any other
   information that witness gave to the safety investigator) loses its privileged status and can be
   used to support disciplinary and/or adverse administrative actions.
   3.4.2. Promises of Confidentiality Authorized. Promises of confidentiality are only
   authorized in investigations of Air Force nuclear, space, aviation, guided missile, directed
   energy, and friendly fire mishaps.
       3.4.2.1. Promises of Confidentiality Not Authorized. Promises of confidentiality are not
       authorized for explosives and chemical agents, afloat, motor vehicle, off-duty military, all
       ground mishaps, and HATRs.
       3.4.2.2. During the investigation of a mishap outside of the categories described in
       paragraph 3.4.2., there may be occasions when a witness or involved contractor will not
       provide a statement or information without a promise of confidentiality. An exception
       may be allowed in circumstances involving complex systems, military unique items, or
       military unique operations or exercises. All requests for exception should be forwarded
       through AFSEC/SEG and AFSEC/JA to AF/SE or AFSEC/CD for approval to grant
       confidentiality to those witnesses.
       3.4.2.2. (AFGSC) Forward requests for confidentiality through applicable NAF/SE to
       AFGSC/SE. If time is a critical factor, i.e., where witness information could be lost or
       compromised, direct the request to AF/SE with electronic information copies to the
       applicable NAF/SE, AFGSC/SE and AFSEC/SE.
 40                                            AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


   3.4.3. Persons Authorized to Make Promises of Confidentiality. Only the ISB President,
   ISB IO, SIB President, SIB IO, or an SIO may offer promises of confidentiality and only
   during safety investigations where promises of confidentiality are authorized. When
   conducting safety investigations in which promises of confidentiality are authorized, the SIB
   President/SIO has the discretion to decide who will be offered a promise of confidentiality.
   The decision should be based upon a witness or contractor’s reluctance to cooperate or
   apparent self-interest in not disclosing information. The SIB President may authorize other
   SIB members to offer the promise of confidentiality in the SIB President’s absence.
   3.4.4. Persons to Whom Promises of Confidentiality May be Offered. Promises of
   confidentiality will only be given as needed to ensure forthright cooperation of the witness
   and may not be given on a blanket basis to all witnesses.
   3.4.5. Non-privileged Witness Statements. If witnesses provide statements without a
   promise of confidentiality, ensure they are informed that their statement will be provided to
   the AIB (if applicable) and/or may be released to the public pursuant to a FOIA request.
   Non-privileged witness statements are placed in Part 1 of the safety report. Consult the Host
   Installation Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) or a labor relations officer for guidance before
   interviewing any federal civilian employees covered by a bargaining unit. Include a signed
   Non-privileged Witness Statement (Figure A3.3.) with the statement.
3.5. Marking and Documenting Safety Information.
   3.5.1. The cover and individual pages of documents containing privileged information will
   be clearly marked with the privileged warning statement (Figure A3.8.). All media
   containing privileged information (audiotapes, videotapes, animations, simulations, computer
   generated profiles, etc.) will be clearly marked with the warning statement (Figure A3.8.).
   See paragraph 3.6.1. for further information on email. Part 1 (Factual Information and
   Releasable Material) of a formal report will not be marked with the privileged warning
   statement.
   3.5.2. Safety reports are for official use only (FOUO), DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security
   Program. However, not each document in the report is FOUO. The factual documents in
   Part 1 of formal safety reports are not typically considered FOUO by this AFI, and should
   not be marked as such. However, documents from other sources included in Part 1 may
   already be marked FOUO. For instance, Part 1 documents may warrant protection based on
   Privacy Act, the Export Control Act, or because they contain proprietary information from a
   contractor. Only the OPR for the document may authorize removal of FOUO markings.
   3.5.3. Promises of Confidentiality (Witness and Contractor Personnel). If a promise of
   confidentiality is offered and accepted, it must be documented. Use the Witness Promise of
   Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (Figure A3.6.) or Memorandum for
   Contractor Representatives Serving as Technical Experts to Safety Investigations
   (Figure A3.9.) where applicable. Read, record, and transcribe the Privileged Witness
   Interview Script (Figure A3.5.) for recorded interviews of witnesses.
   3.5.4. Non-privileged Witness Statements. If witnesses provide statements (written or
   verbal) without a promise of confidentiality, it must be documented by using the Non-
   Privileged Witness Statement (Figure A3.3.). Read, record, and transcribe the Non-
   Privileged Witness Interview Script (Figure A3.2.) for recorded interviews of witnesses.
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                            41


3.6. Transmitting Safety Information.
   3.6.1. To protect the privileged status and to ensure the correct handling of safety reports,
   originating organizations will use the AFSAS reporting system to transmit messages.
   AFSAS is a CAC-enabled system that ensures the protection of privileged information.
   When transmitting or sharing privileged safety information outside of AFSAS follow the
   below procedures:
       3.6.1.1. Ensure no privileged information is included in the body of the email.
       3.6.1.2. Annotate safety reports and messages or portions of reports and messages as
       FOUO following paragraph 3.5.2. guidance, save as a password-protected document, and
       send encrypted.
       3.6.1.3. Send the applicable password in a separate message or by another mode of
       transmission.
       3.6.1.4. If neither AFSAS nor email are available for transmission, a facsimile machine
       (FAX) may be used. Follow the labeling procedures described above. Take precautions
       to ensure the recipient will receive the FAX immediately upon receipt and verify receipt
       once transmitted.
   3.6.2. Classified Mishap Reporting, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports. Submit all
   classified mishap reports (e.g. DULL SWORD, BROKEN ARROW, etc.) via SIPRNET or
   other appropriate classified transmission method for mishap reporting, tracking and
   prevention to the appropriate office for coordination and dissemination. Submit unclassified
   portions of the mishap report in AFSAS as appropriate.
3.7. Authorized Use and Release of Privileged Safety Reports and Information. In order to
help ensure courts honor the assertion of privilege, the rules described in this paragraph must be
followed. The Air Force ensures privileged safety reports and information are used only by
persons and agencies whose duties include relevant mishap prevention responsibilities
(paragraphs 3.7.2. and 3.7.3.). All personnel and agencies authorized access to privileged safety
reports and information will follow the policy in paragraph 3.3. Unique circumstances described
in paragraphs below allow designated individuals to release privileged information outside the
Air Force. Privileged safety information remains Air Force property. Questions regarding
access to privileged safety information should be referred to AFSEC/JA. If an agency outside
the Air Force needs a copy of any safety related documents for mishap prevention, corrective
actions or other purpose, regardless of whether they are privileged, coordinate through
AFSEC/JA and the AFSEC safety specific discipline (SEF/SEG/SEW/SES) by message or
telephone before releasing statements to the requestor. Access is limited to information that is
necessary for and consistent with mishap prevention. Whenever privileged safety information is
requested, first determine whether mishap prevention goals can be met by sanitizing the
information (paragraph 3.7.1.). If the answer is no, then provide only the necessary information
to the authorized persons or agencies with the restrictive markings affixed.
   3.7.1. Sanitizing Privileged Safety Reports. Sanitizing reports or extracts from reports
   means obscuring the relationship between the identity of a mishap and the findings,
   conclusions, causes, recommendations, deliberative processes resulting from the
   investigation, and statements made under a promise of confidentiality. Wing safety officers
   or their designated representatives (that are properly trained) may sanitize privileged safety
42                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


  reports and other media for unit use and for use by authorized contractor personnel. Some
  mishaps, because of widespread publicity or unique circumstances, cannot be fully sanitized.
  After a report has been sanitized, the remaining portions of the findings, causes,
  recommendations, conclusions, or opinions of the investigation are no longer privileged.
  Note: Sanitized reports are not necessarily releasable to the public since they may still
  contain contractor proprietary information or information protected by the Privacy Act, Arms
  Export Control Act, or Export Administration Act. Ensure sanitized reports are appropriately
  labeled. Sanitizing a report involves separating the following identifying information from
  related safety investigation findings, causes, recommendations, conclusions, or opinions:
     3.7.1.1. Date and place of the mishap.
     3.7.1.2. Aircraft, RPA/UAS, missile, vehicle, or weapon serial number.
     3.7.1.3. Names and social security numbers (SSN), if included, of participants,
     witnesses, and investigators.
     3.7.1.4. Any other detail that directly, indirectly, or in aggregate identifies the mishap or
     any individual who has given information pursuant to a promise of confidentiality.
     3.7.1.5. Remove identifying information and markings identifying the documents as
     privileged or FOUO before reproducing sanitized reports or extracts of reports.
     3.7.1.6. Do not release statements or contractor reports obtained with a promise of
     confidentiality.
  3.7.2. Limiting Release within the Air Force. Safety officers and their staffs, duly appointed
  safety investigators, AFSEC personnel and AF/SE and his/her staff, are authorized access to,
  and use of, privileged safety information based on their safety duties. Other Air Force
  officials, when their duties include mishap prevention and when it is necessary to develop,
  take, or review preventive actions, may obtain access to privileged safety information.
  AF/SE, AFSEC/CD and division chiefs, MAJCOM, NAF/Center or unit Chiefs of Safety,
  SIB Presidents or SIOs are authorized, when sanitized information is inadequate, to provide
  privileged safety information as lessons learned to Air Force members on a need-to-know
  basis and solely for mishap prevention. They will ensure members are instructed on properly
  protecting information, their responsibilities to prevent unauthorized release, and that they
  sign non-disclosure agreements. Lessons learned will not include confidential statements or
  contractor reports.
     3.7.2.1. Each organizational SE will be responsible for determining and granting AFSAS
     accounts for personnel within their own organization. SE's will ensure that those granted
     an AFSAS account fully understand the handling and protection of privileged
     information and maintain documentation of annual privileged training for each account
     holder (excluding those with MUSTT only accounts). Account access will be limited to
     mishap prevention purposes.
         3.7.2.1.1. Authorized medical personnel only needing access to the Occupational
         Illness module may gain an AFSAS account through their public health office.
     3.7.2.2. AIB investigators with a safety need to know (e.g., pilots, commanders,
     operations personnel) may have access to privileged safety information from the
     corresponding safety investigation only after final approval of the AIB report. AIB
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                          43


     investigators must first coordinate with the CA, JA, and SE if the AIB report has not been
     released to the public. The CA will determine if access is appropriate before next-of-kin
     are briefed following a fatal mishap.
     3.7.2.3. Part 1 of the two-part formal safety report and certain factual information is
     given to the AIB president (see paragraph 5.14. and the discipline specific safety manual
     AFMAN 91-22X).
     3.7.2.4. ANG and AF Reserve Personnel. Apply the test for releasing privileged safety
     information that is described in paragraph 3.7. Do not withhold privileged safety reports
     from ANG and AF Reserve personnel who have a need to know when sanitized
     information is not adequate to develop, take, or review corrective action. Persons having
     a need to know include, but are not limited to, those involved in mishap prevention;
     whose duties include the preparation, dispatch, or internal distribution of safety reports;
     and those who act in response to mishap prevention recommendations. Releasing
     information under this paragraph does not constitute release outside the Air Force.
     3.7.2.5. Other Air Force officials such as a Staff Judge Advocate (other than
     AFSEC/JA), Historians, Public Affairs, criminal investigative agencies such as the Air
     Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI), and Security Forces do not receive
     privileged safety information because of possible conflicts of interest and because use of
     such information by these officials would not be for mishap prevention purposes.
  3.7.3. Limiting Release Outside the Air Force. In certain cases, the Air Force has agreed to
  exchange privileged safety information with other DoD agencies solely for mishap
  prevention purposes. Also, the Air Force shares certain mishap prevention information with
  other entities in the interests of the general safety community. In all cases, contact HQ
  AFSEC/JA for approval to release.
     3.7.3.1. Responding to Subpoenas and Legal Process (discovery requests, subpoenas,
     court orders, depositions, or other legal processes except as provided in paragraph 3.12).
         3.7.3.1.1. Upon receipt of a legal process requiring participation in a court
         proceeding, including depositions and requests for production of documents, contact
         AFSEC/JA and the nearest Air Force base legal office. Fax a copy of the legal
         process to AFLOA/JACC (DSN 426-9009; commercial (703) 696-9009). Encourage
         requesters to ask the MAJCOM/JA for the AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident
         Investigations, accident investigation report if one has been prepared.
     3.7.3.2. Historical Safety Reports. AF/SE or AFSEC/CD may release the findings of a
     Safety Board, contained in historical safety reports prepared IAW DoDI 6055.07, Mishap
     Notification, Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping (or its predecessors),
     provided no national defense or safety interest exists. For the purpose of this provision,
     historical reports shall be defined as those concerning mishaps more than 30 years old.
     Note: Safety Reports on pre-1956 mishaps are not protected by the safety privilege and
     are stored at the Air Force Historical Research Agency, Maxwell AFB.
     3.7.3.3. Limiting Release to Contractors. Contractors may need access to privileged
     safety information when they are performing an Air Force function involving mishap
     prevention. Contractors may also need access to privileged safety information if they
     designed, built, maintained, or operated Air Force weapon systems, their components, or
44                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


     other Air Force equipment, in order to correct defects or other problems and help prevent
     future mishaps. When contractors need access to privileged safety information either the
     Safety Investigation Non-Disclosure Agreement (Figure A3.1.), or Memorandum for
     Contractor Representatives Serving as Technical Experts to Safety Investigations
     (Figure A3.9.) must be signed and stored at the safety office. Access will be limited to
     what is needed to prevent future mishaps. Contractors will not release the information to
     personnel who do not have safety responsibilities; for example, privileged safety
     information will not be released to the general counsel’s office or public relations
     personnel. The number of contractor employees who have access to the information shall
     be strictly limited to only those individuals who have a need to know the information in
     order to enhance the safety of the Air Force weapon systems. After a project is complete,
     contractors will not maintain the information in their files and will ensure all items are
     destroyed. Contractors must understand and agree to their responsibilities to treat such
     information as confidential (paragraphs 3.3., 3.3.3., and 3.7.). Under no circumstances
     shall an AF contractor not working in direct support of a safety investigation have access
     to information (the witness statement) given to a safety investigator pursuant to a promise
     of confidentiality or to any direct references to that information or to any information that
     could be used to identify the source who provided the information.
        3.7.3.3.1. Contractors who built, designed, or maintained equipment involved in
        mishaps send representatives to support Air Force SIBs at the request of the Air
        Force. SIB presidents and safety investigators will ensure those representatives
        understand that the Air Force may, at the contractor’s request, extend a claim of
        privilege over documents provided by the contractor representatives to the SIB when
        the Air Force maintains sole possession or control. A claim of privilege may not be
        sustained over notes, documents, and other matter produced during the SIB
        investigation by the contractor but retained by the contractor representatives. The
        SIB president grants these contractors access to privileged safety information only if
        it is essential to assist the SIB.
        3.7.3.3.2. Contractors providing weapon system maintenance support are performing
        an Air Force function. The wing Chief of Safety, NAF/SE, MAJCOM/SE, or AFSEC
        may provide the contractors safety information for AF safety purposes.
        3.7.3.3.3. Air Force operations conducted at contractors’ facilities require privileged
        safety information handling.
        3.7.3.3.4. Contractors providing weapon system crew training are performing an Air
        Force function, and need privilege safety information from safety reports, videos, and
        other similar media to build training scenarios. The wing Chief of Safety, NAF/SE,
        MAJCOM/SE, or AFSEC may provide the contractors privileged safety reports for
        this function.
        3.7.3.3.5. Contractors who instruct safety programs in mishap investigation or safety
        program management contracted by the Air Force or ARC require access to
        privileged safety information. The wing Chief of Safety, NAF/SE, MAJCOM/SE, or
        AFSEC may provide the contractors safety reports for this function.
        3.7.3.3.6. Contractors who build, design, maintain, or operate Air Force weapon
        systems, their components, or other Air Force equipment may need privileged safety
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                         45


        information to correct defects or other problems and prevent future mishaps. The
        wing Chief of Safety, NAF/SE, MAJCOM/SE, System Program Office safety officer
        or equivalent, or AF/SE or AFSEC/CD may provide contractors privileged safety
        information for this function. This includes Space System Contractors, Space
        Technical Support Contractors, Advisory & Assistance Services, and Federally
        Funded Research & Development Centers when they are performing an Air Force
        function.
        3.7.3.3.7. Contractors performing AF safety functions may require privileged safety
        information. Wing Chief of Safety, NAF/SE, MAJCOM/SE, or AFSEC/JA may
        authorize access to privileged safety information for this function.
        3.7.3.3.8. Any other release of privileged safety information to contractors must first
        be approved by AF/SE or AFSEC/CD.
     3.7.3.4. Limiting Release to Other Services and DoD Agencies. Approval authority for
     exchanging formal safety reports with other military services is AF/SE, AFSEC/CD or
     AFSEC/JA. Other US military services and DoD agencies responsible for flying,
     supporting or maintaining Air Force aircraft may request privileged safety information
     when needed for mishap prevention. Joint project or program offices may share
     privileged safety information with members of other DoD agencies working on the same
     project or program without prior approval.
     3.7.3.5. Limiting Release to Foreign Military Organizations. All agreements regarding
     the release of safety information to foreign military organizations are subject to the
     limitations and guidance found in DoDI 6055.07, Mishap Notification, Investigation,
     Reporting, and Record Keeping and DoDD 5530.3, International Agreements. Release
     of safety information to NATO military organizations is governed by NATO STANAGs
     3101, Exchange of Safety Information Concerning Aircraft and Missiles, and 3531, Safety
     Investigation and Reporting of Accident/Incidents Involving Military Aircraft, Missiles,
     And/Or UAVs.
        3.7.3.5.1. Foreign Nationals Flying USAF Aircraft or Participating in USAF
        Training. Release of safety information to foreign nationals is governed by DoDI
        6055.07, Mishap Notification, Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping. Note
        that foreign national military personnel assigned to the DoD Components are defined
        as DoD military personnel by DoDI 6055.07, Mishap Notification, Investigation,
        Reporting, and Record Keeping. Note: Foreign nationals in student status are not
        authorized access to privileged safety information.
        3.7.3.5.2. Comparable persons and offices within European Participating Air Forces
        countries may have access to privileged information pertaining to F-16 mishaps only.
        These countries are participants in the multinational fighter program of co-production
        of the F-16 with the United States. The release authority is the AF/SE. This
        information is for mishap prevention purposes only.
     3.7.3.6. Limiting Release of Nuclear Safety Reports to Agencies outside the Air Force.
     AF/SE may approve the release of extracts of nuclear safety reports to US governmental
     agencies with statutory jurisdiction, such as the DTRA; and operations offices or
     authorized contractors of the Department of Energy. The MAJCOM commander may
 46                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


       provide DULL SWORD reports about weapons and common equipment deficiencies to
       the unified commander as deemed appropriate and necessary for the theater commander
       to accomplish his or her role in nuclear surety. Send this information by inclusion of the
       appropriate unified command address in the message report as provided by the MAJCOM
       supplement to this instruction. The unified commander ensures the information is treated
       as privileged information and not released or distributed outside the respective
       headquarters without first obtaining permission from AF/SE. The Air Force releases this
       information only to reach its nuclear surety goals.
       3.7.3.7. Limiting Release to NTSB and FAA. AFI 91-206, Participation in a Military or
       Civil Aircraft Accident Safety Investigation, governs the release of safety information to
       the NTSB and FAA for aviation mishaps. For other mishaps, use AFI 91-206,
       Participation in a Military or Civil Aircraft Accident Safety Investigation, as a guide.
       3.7.3.8. Limiting Release to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
       and National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). Applicable space safety reports will be
       distributed to NASA and NRO upon completion.
       3.7.3.9. Sharing privileged safety information with non-DoD US Government Agencies.
       AF/SE may establish reciprocal formal agreements for sharing relevant safety
       information with other federal agencies regarding similar airframes or systems for mishap
       prevention purposes, but only where adequate protection of privileged safety information
       exists to maintain the safety privilege, and where the recipient agency agrees to provide
       similar safety information to the Air Force. All such reciprocal agreements must meet
       the requirements of DoDI 6055.07, Mishap Notification, Investigation, Reporting, and
       Record Keeping. Whenever appropriate the AF should share non-privileged safety
       information such as aggregate data or sanitized reports in lieu of privileged reports.
3.8. Authorized Use and Release of Non-Privileged Safety Reports and Information. Safety
Reports may contain non-privileged information (e.g., Part 1 of Class A and B Aviation Safety
Reports) and some reports are non-privileged in their entirety. The purpose of these reports is
mishap prevention. These reports can be released outside the Air Force safety community and
outside the Air Force once protected information, including Privacy Act information and Export
Control Act information, is removed.
   3.8.1. Do not disclose the identities of involved personnel in educational or promotional
   materials.
   3.8.2. When release will be made outside the AF, AFSEC/JA or their delegated
   representative is the release authority. AFSEC personnel or the installation chief of safety is
   the release authority for providing these reports to other Air Force personnel. The reports
   may not be used for any purpose other than mishap prevention.
   3.8.3. To control reports, do not retain copies at the local level. Access to non-privileged
   reports will be through AFSAS, and all copies will be destroyed when no longer needed for
   mishap prevention purposes.
3.9. Handling and Disclosing Reports on Ground and Industrial, and Explosives and
Chemical Agents Mishaps that occurred before 3 Oct 00.
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                             47


   3.9.1. The purpose of these reports is mishap prevention. The reports were normally
   considered general-use reports in that witnesses were not promised confidentiality, and the
   reports were not considered privileged. However, they are FOUO and are handled according
   to DoD Regulation 5400.7-R/AF Supplement, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program.
   3.9.2. Do not disclose the identities of involved personnel in educational or promotional
   materials.
   3.9.3. These reports can be released outside the Air Force safety community and outside the
   Air Force once protected information, including Privacy Act information, findings, and
   recommendations are removed. When release will be made outside the AF, AFSEC/JA is the
   release authority. The installation chief of safety is the release authority for providing these
   reports to other Air Force personnel. The reports may not be used for any purpose other than
   mishap prevention, with the exception that the complete report may be released to Air Force
   claims personnel to assist them in evaluating claims for damages filed against the Air Force.
   3.9.3. (AFGSC) Requests for release outside of the Air Force will be made through the
   local JA. Provide a courtesy copy to the appropriate NAF and HQ AFGSC/JA.
   3.9.4. To control reports retain only one copy of each safety report at wing or base,
   intermediate command, and MAJCOM safety offices. Air Force and unified command
   agencies may view these reports for official purposes, but they do not release copies without
   approval of the appropriate disclosure authority. Advise personnel viewing these reports that
   findings of cause, conclusions, recommendations, corrective actions, and witness statements
   taken by safety investigators in the course of the investigation are used primarily for mishap
   prevention purposes. Refer all requests for release to AFSEC/JA.
   3.9.5. Upon written request, AFSEC/JA provides the releasable portions of ground and
   explosive safety reports to the requester.
3.10. Technical Orders (TOs) and Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs). TOs and
TCTOs, including maintenance manuals and flights manuals, are usually limited release
documents. They are often protected by Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) (22
U.S.C. 2778); the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C app. 2401-2420); or the
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). Written approval (e-
mail is acceptable) must be obtained from the technical content manager prior to including these
documents in Part 1 SIB reports. Include a copy of the approval in the formal report.
3.11. Actual or Potential Compromise of Privileged Safety Information
   3.11.1. Policy.
       3.11.1.1. It is Air Force policy that unauthorized releases of privileged information will
       be thoroughly investigated to minimize any possible damage to national security and to
       continue to ensure safety privilege is protected. The investigation will identify
       appropriate corrective actions that will be immediately implemented to prevent future
       unauthorized releases.
       3.11.1.2. Suspected instances of unauthorized public disclosure of privileged safety
       information shall be reported promptly and investigated to determine the nature and
       circumstances of the unauthorized disclosure, the extent of the disclosure, and any
 48                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


      ramifications on protecting it from further release, and the corrective and disciplinary
      action to be taken.
      3.11.1.3. A compromise of privileged safety information occurs when unauthorized
      individuals are knowingly, willfully, or negligently given access to privileged safety
      information. Unauthorized individuals include those individuals who do not have a
      safety need-to-know. Refer to paragraph 3.7.
   3.11.2. Reporting and Notifications.
      3.11.2.1. Personnel who learn of an unauthorized release of privileged safety information
      should immediately report it to their MAJCOM Safety office, who will in-turn report the
      incident to AFSEC/JA.
3.12. Protection of Privileged Safety Information from Use in Court Proceedings.
   3.12.1. The procedures in this section are used to protect privileged safety information when
   parties to civil litigation or criminal trials attempt to compel its release.
   3.12.2. A copy of the releasable portions of the safety investigation report shall be provided
   to a party of a court proceeding upon request. Information that is protected from release to
   the public only by the Privacy Act is releasable for this purpose. All such requests must be
   forwarded to AFSEC/JA for action.
   3.12.3. Requests for privileged safety information will be processed in accordance with
   DoDI 6055.07, Mishap Notification, Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping and the
   delegation of authority provided in AF Mission Directive 1-45. Copies of any court orders
   seeking to compel release of privileged safety information should be immediately forwarded
   to AFSEC/JA.

                                           Chapter 4

                  DETERMINING INVESTIGATIVE RESPONSIBILITY

4.1. General Information. The Air Force generally assigns mishap investigative
responsibilities to the MAJCOM that experienced the loss of an assigned/owned asset (personnel
or property). The MAJCOM with investigative responsibility may or may not have Operation
Control over the asset (property). In some cases, mishaps may involve assets or individuals from
multiple agencies. Follow the guidance in this chapter and DoDI 6055.07 Mishap Notification,
Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping, Enclosure 8 to determine mishap notification,
investigation, and reporting procedures.
4.2. Convening Authority Determination. The CA is the individual who has the authority to
order a safety investigation. The MAJCOM/CC of the organization that owns the asset is
considered to be the CA unless: AF/SE assumes investigative responsibility, another
MAJCOM/CC assumes investigative responsibility (with the concurrence of the owning
organization and AF/SE), or investigative responsibility is delegated to a lower level of
command.
   4.2.1. For all on-duty Class A and all NUCFLASH, BROKEN ARROW, EMPTY QUIVER,
   or BENT SPEAR mishaps, the MAJCOM/CC is the CA. This authority will not be delegated
   to a subordinate commander. Exception: For ARC Class A mishaps see paragraph 4.5.
   4.2.2. For all other mishaps and events, the CA may be delegated to an appropriate level of
   command. This delegation will be made in writing within the MAJCOM supplement.
   4.2.2. (AFGSC) The NAF/CC is convening authority (CA) for all on-duty Class B mishaps.
   The Wing/CC is CA for all off-duty Ground mishaps and all Class C and D mishaps and
   Class E events unless otherwise directed by AFGSC/SE. The NAF/CC may delegate CA to
   the mishap Wing/CC for on-duty Class B Ground mishaps on a case-by-case basis.
   4.2.3. The Owning Unit is that unit which has permanent possession and mishap reporting
   accountability for the assets and personnel involved in the mishap. For mishaps involving
   multiple “owning” units within the same command, the units involved will mutually agree
   who will assume CA and mishap reporting responsibilities. In cases where agreement cannot
   be reached, the MAJCOM/CC will determine the accountable organization.
   4.2.4. For RPA mishaps where damage is confined to the RPA, the owning MAJCOM is the
   organization that owns the RPA, regardless of the controlling organization.
4.3. Mishaps Involving Multiple Commands. Involved MAJCOM/CCs will determine which
command will assume investigative responsibility and advise AF/SE within 24 hours. In
general, the command whose asset initiated the mishap will assume investigative responsibility.
If mishap initiation is initially unclear, the command sustaining the highest level of loss in the
mishap will assume investigative responsibility. The MAJCOM/CC may determine other
compelling reasons exist for assigning investigative responsibility differently. If MAJCOMs
cannot reach agreement, AF/SE will determine mishap investigation responsibility.
4.4. Mishaps Involving Multiple Services. For a multi-service or joint operational mishap,
follow most current MOU among the US Army, Air Force and Naval Safety Centers,
Headquarters Marine Corps (Safety Division) and the US Coast Guard Health and Safety
 50                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


Directorate for Safety Investigation and Reporting of Joint Service Mishaps (see Attachment 8).
The MAJCOM/SE should contact the applicable AFSEC safety discipline division to determine
investigative responsibility.
4.5. Mishaps Involving Air Reserve Component Assets. The CA for all ARC Class A
aviation mishaps is the gaining MAJCOM/CC. For all other mishaps and events, convening
authority is determined by the AFRC/CC or NGB/CF as applicable.
4.6. Mishaps Involving NATO Systems or Personnel. Investigate and report mishaps
involving Air Force aircraft, space vehicles, or missiles according to this instruction. Comply
with NATO STANAG 3102, Flight Safety Co-operation in Common Ground/Air Space, 3318,
Aeromedical Aspects of Aircraft Accident/Incident Investigation, 3531, Safety investigation and
Reporting of Accident/Incidents Involving Military Aircraft and/or Missiles, and AIR STD
85/02A, Investigation of Aircraft/Missile Accidents/Incidents (with US reservations). The
investigation required under STANAG 3531, Safety investigation and Reporting of
Accident/Incidents Involving Military Aircraft, Missiles, And/Or UAVs is in addition to, and
conducted separately from, the investigation required by this instruction.
   4.6.1. When a ground mishap/event involves only NATO military assets and/or personnel,
   the NATO nation military authorities are responsible for the investigation. The USAF
   generally reserves the right to participate as an observer on the NATO safety investigation or,
   if no investigation is conducted, the right to conduct its own safety investigation.
   4.6.2. When an on-duty ground mishap/event involves both USAF and NATO assets and/or
   personnel (military or civilian), the Air Force will conduct a safety investigation.
4.7. Mishaps Involving Non-NATO Foreign Military Equipment or Personnel in the
Continental United States (CONUS). It is desirable to conduct only one safety investigation
that has the full support and participation of all involved nations. However, separate
investigations are authorized if necessary due to law, agreement, or procedure.
   4.7.1. When a mishap/event involves only foreign military assets and/or personnel, the
   foreign nation military authorities are responsible for the investigation to include off-duty
   mishap/events. The USAF generally reserves the right to participate as an observer on the
   foreign safety investigation or, if no investigation is conducted, the right to conduct its own
   safety investigation.
   4.7.2. When a mishap/event involves a foreign military aircraft and a US civilian aircraft in
   the CONUS, the NTSB has priority over the investigation (paragraph 4.8.).
   4.7.3. When an on-duty mishap/event involves both USAF and foreign assets and/or
   personnel (military or civilian), the Air Force will conduct a safety investigation. Depending
   on the circumstances the NTSB may take priority over the investigation.
4.8. Mishaps Involving Civil Aviation, Commercial Spacelift, Civil Air Patrol and USAF
Aero Clubs, and USAF Flight Screening Students.
   4.8.1. The NTSB investigates mishaps involving both Air Force and civil aircraft that occur
   within US jurisdiction. The Air Force may send an observer to the NTSB investigation
   and/or may conduct a separate investigation. However, the NTSB has priority over all
   evidence. See AFI 91-206, Participation in a Military or Civil Aircraft Accident Safety
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                             51


   Investigations, for guidance on NTSB, FAA, and Air Force cooperation in these
   investigations.
   4.8.2. Air Force mishaps that occur within US jurisdiction involving commercial spacelift
   may be investigated by the NTSB, the FAA/AST, and the commercial vendor depending on
   the extent of the mishap. The Air Force may send an observer to any of these investigations
   and/or may conduct a separate investigation. If the NTSB leads the investigation, the NTSB
   has priority over all evidence. See AFMAN 91-222, Space Safety Investigations and
   Reports, for more information.
   4.8.3. For mishaps involving Civil Air Patrol (CAP), USAF active duty, or government
   civilians flying CAP-owned assets on approved AF missions, follow the procedures in
   paragraph 4.8.1. and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports. Mishaps
   involving CAP volunteers or CAP Corporation employees will be handled by the
   NTSB/FAA.
   4.8.4. USAF Aero Club Mishaps. For mishaps involving Air Force Aero Clubs, the NTSB
   is the lead investigating agency. If the NTSB or designated representative agency does not
   investigate, the host wing commander will direct the wing safety office to conduct an
   investigation. Exception: For mishaps occurring outside the United States, the host nation
   civil aviation authority may have jurisdiction and investigative authority.
      4.8.4.1. If an Aero Club aircraft is on a USAF-directed mission, investigate IAW this
      AFI and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports (i.e., Air Force
      personnel using an Aero Club aircraft to conduct an airfield assessment for certification
      purposes).
   4.8.5. Civil Aviation mishaps resulting in injury to Air Force students participating in Initial
   Flight Screening (IFS), Navigator Introductory Flight Training (NIFT), and other contracted
   flight training are considered Aircraft Flight mishaps and investigations of these mishaps will
   also be conducted IAW this AFI and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and
   Reports.
4.9. Mishaps Involving Contractors.
   4.9.1. Government contractor involvement. Mishaps considered “in the open” means the
   aircraft is outside the contractor’s facility while mishaps “under cover” means the aircraft is
   inside the contractor facility undergoing modification or is undergoing production. (See AFI
   10-220, Contractor’s Flight and Ground Operations).
      4.9.1.1. If the Air Force administers the contract and the mishap involves reportable
      damage or injury to the Air Force (paragraph 1.3.1.1.), the MAJCOM/CC administering
      the contract is the CA. CA may be transferred based on preponderance of loss,
      operational control, equity in the mishap, or IAW paragraph 4.2. The CA will ensure the
      mishap is investigated and reported IAW this instruction and the terms of the contract.
      4.9.1.2. If the Air Force administers the contract and the mishap involves reportable
      damage or injury to another DoD agency (paragraph 1.3.1.1.), the CA will ensure all
      mishap information is sent to the involved agency with an information copy to AFSEC.
      4.9.1.3. If another DoD agency administers the contract and the mishap involves
      reportable damage or injury to the Air Force (paragraph 1.3.1.1.), the MAJCOM who
 52                                              AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


      suffered the preponderance of loss will ensure the mishap is investigated and reported
      according to this instruction.
   4.9.2. Mishaps Involving Non-Accepted Air Force Aerospace Vehicles. The MAJCOM/CC
   who negotiates the contract for the aerospace vehicle is the CA. The CA may be delegated
   IAW paragraph 4.2. Non-accepted aerospace vehicle mishaps may be investigated at the
   discretion of the CA. These losses (non-DoD aircraft) are recorded as mishaps to the Air
   Force at Large.
   4.9.3. Mishaps involving aerospace vehicles leased to a Non-DoD organization for
   modification, maintenance, repair, test, contract training, or experimental project for a DoD
   Component, when the government has assumed ground and flight risk. The MAJCOM/CC
   who negotiates the contract for the aerospace vehicle is the convening CA. The CA may be
   delegated IAW paragraph 4.2. The CA is responsible for the safety investigation and
   reporting, although the aerospace vehicle may not be under the operational control of the Air
   Force. The aerospace vehicle loss is recorded as a mishap to the Air Force at Large.
      4.9.3.1. AFMC centers normally negotiate all aircraft and engine leases. If another
      agency negotiates a lease, the agency and HQ AFMC/SE shall determine who the CA
      will be prior to executing the lease.
   4.9.4. Other Aerospace Vehicle Contractor Mishaps. If a mishap involves government-
   furnished or leased aerospace vehicles, or new production aerospace vehicles (accepted by
   the Air Force on a DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, but not yet
   delivered), the MAJCOM/CC of the command negotiating the contract/lease is the CA unless
   otherwise specified in the contract/lease agreement. In cases where contract/lease
   agreements specify investigative jurisdiction, follow the terms of such agreements. In no
   case will a non-Air Force agency have safety investigation jurisdiction.
   4.9.5. Aerospace Vehicle Contractor Mishaps Involving Air Force Indemnification. For
   operations involving unusual hazardous safety risks that are indemnified by the Air Force,
   such as contractor provided launch services for Air Force or National Security Space
   payloads, the MAJCOM that acquired the operational service is the CA for the mishap.
4.10. Civilian Occupational Mishaps.
   4.10.1. OSHA will be notified of an on-duty mishap resulting in an Air Force civilian
   employee fatality, to include heart attack victims, or involving the inpatient hospitalization of
   three or more people (one of which must be a DoD civilian employee) within 8 hours of an
   on-duty mishap (paragraph 2.7.6.3.).
   4.10.1. (AFGSC) If the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) plans to
   visit or conduct a separate investigation, provide them a complete in-brief and immediately
   notify the NAF/SE and HQ AFGSC/SE. HQ AFGSC/SE will notify appropriate AFGSC
   staff agencies and HQ AFSEC/SEG.
   4.10.2. OSHA officials may accompany Air Force safety investigators as observers, or they
   may conduct a separate investigation of occupational mishaps involving either a DoD civilian
   fatality or the inpatient hospitalizations of three or more civilian personnel (one of which
   must be an on-duty DoD civilian employee). Ensure Air Force personnel accompany OSHA
   officials.
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                              53


4.11. Special Circumstances.
   4.11.1. Mishaps Involving Friendly Fire. Unless otherwise agreed, the Service whose forces
   suffer the preponderance of loss or injury will conduct a safety investigation at the discretion
   of the Combatant Commander and, after consultation and coordination with the Combatant
   Commander, through the Combatant Commander’s Service Component. For mishaps
   involving other friendly nations, the involved Service Safety Chief shall consult with the
   Deputy Under secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment (DUSD) and the
   Combatant Commander to determine what role the other involved nations will play in the
   investigation. In those circumstances where the only forces lost or injured are those of other
   friendly nations, the Service conducting the safety investigation will be determined at the
   discretion of the Combatant Commander. Refer to DoDI 6055.07, Mishap Notification,
   Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping, and the Joint Service MOU (Attachment 8)
   for specific guidance on command relationships and reporting requirements.
   4.11.2. Mishaps Involving Potential Criminal Acts. If safety investigators discover evidence
   of criminal acts causal to the mishap, they must immediately stop the investigation and notify
   the CA. The CA shall notify the responsible Military Criminal Investigative Organization or
   Federal or local law enforcement, depending on jurisdiction at the location of the mishap,
   IAW DoDI 6055.07, Mishap Notification, Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping,
   paragraphs E3.3 and E4.3.b(1), when they determine there is credible evidence of criminal
   activity. The CA will, after coordinating with AF/SE, determine whether the safety
   investigation should continue or be suspended pending the criminal investigation. In the
   investigation of a fatal mishap (if initiated), an OSI investigation will take precedence over
   the safety investigation until criminal activity, natural causes, and suicide have been ruled out
   as possible causes of damage, injury, or death.
      4.11.2.1. If the CA decides to suspend the safety investigation, investigators will give all
      non-privileged material to the legal investigators, provide them with the names of all
      known witnesses, and safeguard all privileged material. If the safety investigation is
      suspended, it may be resumed and completed after the criminal investigation or when
      determined by the CA, as appropriate.
   4.11.3. Mishaps Involving Fire Loss. For fire losses meeting the Class A or B mishap
   threshold involving real property, wildlands from wildland fires, or personal property
   (excluding military aircraft flight-related operations), provide an independent fire
   investigation and report. The fire investigation and report shall identify point of origin and
   cause of fire (the circumstances, conditions, or agencies that bring together a fuel, ignition
   source, and oxidizer, such as air or oxygen) for inclusion in subsequent legal or safety
   investigations. See AFI 32-2001, Fire Emergency Services Program, paragraph 5.1.7. for
   support provided by FES for mishap investigations and reports. Fire reports will be loaded in
   the appropriate tab when applicable.
 54                                              AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


                                           Chapter 5

                                SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS

5.1. General Information. The CA determines the depth of investigative effort required for
each mishap, subject to this instruction and the appropriate discipline specific safety manual
(AFMAN 91-22X). Several factors influence the depth of investigative effort required: severity
of injury or occupational illness, future mishap potential, and whether another agency’s
investigation will produce a report the Air Force can use for mishap prevention. Other agencies,
such as the local police or NTSB, may investigate mishaps that occur within their jurisdiction. A
separate Air Force investigation will be completed when required by this instruction. However,
the safety investigator may use the other agencies’ reports and information when applicable.
5.2. Investigation Timeline. The safety investigation should be completed within 30 days of
the mishap (See Table 6.1. for reporting timelines and exceptions). The investigation should
place a greater priority on a thorough, complete, and accurate safety report than on trying to
finish in the 30-day timeline. If the investigation cannot be completed within this 30-day period,
the SIB/SIO will request an extension from the CA. The SIB/SIO will annotate the extension
and approval by the CA in each status message. The SIB should remain convened until all
aspects of the investigation are completed (the SIB may temporarily de-convene while waiting to
outbrief the CA).
5.3. Investigation Funding.
   5.3.1. Local Support. The commander of the Air Force installation hosting the SIB funds all
   in-house support even if the host installation is not assigned to the investigating MAJCOM.
   (See paragraph 5.3.5. for expenses that exceed the resources of the host installation.)
   Occasionally, SIBs are required to work in areas where military support is not available.
   When civilian services are required, the Mission Support Group Commander at the
   installation supporting the SIB should assign loan and contracting officers. The loan officer
   will have authority and funds to pay for all support requirements (DoD Financial
   Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Volume 5, Disbursing Policy & Procedure, Chapter 2,
   Section 0204, Imprest Funds). The contracting officer must have a warrant (authority) to
   purchase equipment and services for the board.
   5.3.1. (AFGSC) Local Support. Host installation will appoint a local Government Purchase
   Card (GPC) cardholder (e.g. “contracting officer”) to support the SIB.
   5.3.2. Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel. Each MAJCOM, via their respective wings/units,
   funds TDY of its assigned personnel who are Air Force SIB members or technical experts.
   TDY SIB members should be placed on full per diem for the duration of the SIB (unless
   directed otherwise by MAJCOM guidance) since the schedule that SIB members may work
   won’t necessarily align with the schedule of the base dining facility. Exception: If the SIB
   convenes at a location under “field conditions” (i.e., AOR location with billeting and meals
   provided) they will receive the same per diem as other personnel deployed to that location.
   Variations and rental cars should be authorized, dual billeting at the discretion of the CA.
   For joint service boards, each service funds its own members’ TDY. The investigating
   MAJCOM funds travel costs of members from another service appointed to an Air Force
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                           55


   SIB. Observers to an Air Force SIB fund their own TDY. AFSEC SIB representatives also
   travel via their own funding.
   5.3.2. (AFGSC) Personnel appointed to HQ AFGSC-sponsored Class A safety
   investigations shall be placed on full per diem and have dual lodging, variations, and rental
   car authorized. Board members shall use government quarters when available and when the
   use of government quarters does not adversely affect mission accomplishment. Travelling
   board members will hold Government Travel Cards (GTCs).
       5.3.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/SE will coordinate with HQ AFGSC/FM to
       establish and make available an Emergency and Special Program (ESP) code and a line
       of accounting to reimburse Class A board member travel.
   5.3.3. Contractor support. Normally contractors travel via their own funding. To provide
   easier access to the base and its facilities required during the investigation, the contractor
   may request a Letter of Identification from the Contracting Officer. The CA will honor these
   requests. The Letter of Identification will not have a fund cite (i.e., no cost to the
   government). Joint Travel Regulations, Volume 2, Appendix E, Part I, paragraph D and E
   are applicable.
   5.3.4. Other Support. The CA funds leasing of special equipment/vehicles, leased
   communications, and other contractual services. For technical assistance and laboratory
   analysis (paragraph 5.5.) from non-Air Force specialists, the CA or PM may have to provide
   funding to obtain support.
   5.3.5. Cost Overruns. Request an operating budget authority (OBA) adjustment per AFI 65-
   601, Volume 2, Budget Management for Operations, if investigation costs cannot be
   financed through reprogramming within the OBA.
   5.3.6. (Added-AFGSC) Units should advise AFGSC/SE and notify the local FMA
   (Financial Analysis Division) office if unable to provide funds. The local FMA office will,
   in turn, contact HQ AFGSC Base Support (HQ AFGSC/FMAO).
5.4. Investigation Options. The size and membership of the investigation depends on the
category and complexity of the mishap being investigated. The investigation must have the
correct complement of members to properly complete the investigation. Investigations may be
made up of multiple members (SIB), or a single member (SIO). Refer to the discipline specific
safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X) for requirements. The SIB Board President (BP) will
coordinate with the CA regarding requests for additional SIB member, observers, and technical
experts.
   5.4.1. Safety Investigation Boards (SIB). SIBs are made up of multiple members assigned to
   investigate a mishap. Contractor representatives will not be primary members of a SIB.
   They are technical experts providing assistance to the SIB.
       5.4.1.1. At least one SIB member must be equal to or senior in rank to the senior person
       directly involved in the mishap. Normally, the SIB president is the senior SIB member.
       5.4.1.2. Select SIB members who do not have a personal interest in the investigation and
       who are able to act impartially. See AFMAN 91-22X for SIB personnel limitations and
       restrictions.
56                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


     5.4.1.3. Select a SIB member qualified in safety investigations (see AFMAN 91-22X for
     exceptions) for each safety discipline involved in the mishap. A system safety engineer
     should be included in all Class A and B mishap investigations involving material,
     weapons, or information systems.
     5.4.1.4. Do not assign foreign exchange officers or other foreign officers serving with the
     USAF as formal SIB members. This exclusion does not apply to AFSEC SIB
     representatives. Comply with provisions in standing international agreements.
     5.4.1.5. ARC participation in SIBs. The CA may appoint Reservists/Air National
     Guardsmen to SIBs with the concurrence of the AFRC/National Guard Bureau (NGB).
     Ensure SIB duties do not create a conflict of interest with the individual's civilian
     occupation or interests. MAJCOMs may execute MOAs/MOUs with AFRC and NGB to
     outline processes for nominating SIB members as needed on ARC-involved mishaps.
        5.4.1.5.1. AFRC. Air Reserve Technicians may elect to participate in either military
        or civilian status, as appropriate. Traditional reservists will be in a military status.
        5.4.1.5.2. ANG. ANG personnel may elect to participate in either military or
        technician status, as appropriate.
     5.4.1.6. AFSEC/SEG has the option to provide a representative to the SIB for on-duty
     Class A mishaps, unusual high interest off-duty Class A mishaps, and complex Class B
     mishaps, as determined by AFSEC/SEG and CA. AFSEC will fund the representative.
     AFSEC/SEG will offer telephonic support for all Class A mishaps.
     5.4.1.7. (Added-AFGSC) Nomination procedures for a Class A SIB without fatalities.
     Upon notification of a suspected or actual Class A mishap involving an HQ AFGSC
     asset, HQ AFGSC/SE will task the affected NAF/SE to provide two fully qualified
     nominees per solicited board position to HQ AFGSC/SE within 24 hours using AFGSC
     Form 205. HQ AFGSC/A1 shall provide a list of all HQ AFGSC staff assigned BP-
     qualified individuals to HQ AFGSC/SE within 12 hours upon request for consideration.
        5.4.1.7.1. (Added-AFGSC) Demographic and training data relevant to safety
        investigations will be provided for each nominee on the form. This demographic data
        shall include, but is not limited to, previous duty experience in a safety-related
        occupation (e.g., weapons safety officer, chief of safety), safety-specific training and
        date(s) accomplished, experience in the subject weapon system (e.g., total flight time,
        total maintenance experience), crew qualification(s), and previous investigation
        experience. NAF/CCs should review the nominees and provide a rank order
        recommendation to AFGSC/CC. The CA will use this data to select the most suitable
        board candidates for the investigation. Note: SIB medical members will be sourced
        independently by AFGSC/SG, and SIB recorders will be provided by the installation
        supporting the SIB.
     5.4.1.8. (Added-AFGSC) Nomination procedures for a Class A SIB with fatalities. The
     same procedures as in paragraph 5.4.1.7 shall be followed, except that HQ AFGSC shall
     source the board president (BP). In this case, AFGSC/A1 shall provide a list of all HQ
     AFGSC-assigned general officers and their availability to serve as a SIB BP to
     AFGSC/SE within 12 hours of request.
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                           57


       5.4.1.9. (Added-AFGSC) NAFs will ensure the following criteria are complied with
       when offering candidates for SIB consideration:
          5.4.1.9.1. (Added-AFGSC) Investigation Officer (IO). ICBM wings may substitute
          comparably experienced and trained GS-11 or greater government civilians as
          candidates for a Class A weapons mishap IO.
          5.4.1.9.2. (Added-AFGSC) Maintenance Member. The maintenance member must
          be an E-7 or above with current experience with the mishap weapons system (flight or
          weapons mishaps). ICBM wings may substitute comparably experienced and trained
          GS-9 or higher government civilians as candidates for aviation Class A SIB
          maintenance members.
       5.4.1.10. (Added-AFGSC) For Class A mishaps, AFGSC/SE will publish board
       appointment memoranda and/or board orders “For the Commander” after all SIB
       positions are filled with approved candidates. For Class B mishaps, the convening
       authority will publish as necessary.
   5.4.2. Single Investigating Officer (SIO). Depending on the circumstances of the mishap, an
   individual investigator may be appointed to conduct the investigation.
   5.4.3. Air Force Participation in Non-Air Force Investigations.          When Air Force
   representation to another Service’s or government agency's investigation is desired, AFSEC
   will contact the MAJCOM(s) that can best meet the requirement. The MAJCOM/SE will
   coordinate the selection with AFSEC. Once AF/SE approves the nominee, AFSEC will
   provide a fund site to the MAJCOM and establish direct communication with the individual.
   Air Force representatives to Joint Safety Investigations should be graduates of formal Air
   Force safety training courses.
   5.4.4. Participation in Air Force Investigations by Non-Air Force Personnel. Sometimes a
   mishap involves weapon systems or equipment common to another US military service or
   agency (FAA, NASA, etc.). In these cases personnel from the other service or agency may
   request to observe the Air Force investigation. AFSEC forwards these requests to the CA.
   Refer to AFI 91-206, Participation in a Military or Civil Aircraft Accident Safety
   Investigation, and applicable MOAs/MOUs for interagency involvement. If approved by the
   CA, observers are authorized to observe SIB activities and may participate to the extent
   authorized by the SIB president and published guidance. An observer is not a member of the
   Air Force SIB. Non-DoD observers may participate to the extent authorized by the SIB
   president. This should not include non-DoD observers’ participation in or access to direct
   confidential testimony. Exception: For NTSB and FAA observers, see AFI 91-206,
   Participation in a Military or Civil Aircraft Accident Safety Investigation.
   5.4.5. RPA/UAS operations often require the creation of two or more ISBs to preserve
   evidence especially when operating overseas. The primary ISB is located at the base with the
   aircrew controlling the mission of the aircraft. A second ISB will be located at the launch
   and recovery ground control station. Additional ISB’s will be added at other locations for the
   protection of evidence as deemed necessary by the CA. The primary ISB will collect all of
   the supporting evidence from all other ISB’s.
5.5. Obtaining and Using Technical Assistance and Laboratory Analysis. When the
investigation is beyond the expertise of the SIB/SIO, they will request technical assistance.
58                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


  5.5.1. For all Class A and B mishaps, technical assistance and laboratory analysis will be
  requested through AFSEC. For all other mishap classes, technical assistance and laboratory
  analysis may also be available through AFSEC. Note: See Attachment 2 for technical
  assistance contact information.
  5.5.2. Using Technical Experts.
     5.5.2.1. Technical experts supporting an investigation are bound to follow SIB
     president/SIO guidance while directly working and serving the SIB. This applies to DoD
     military and civilian personnel as well as contractor representatives. The SIB president
     or SIO should involve technical experts as early in the investigation as possible, ideally at
     the start of the investigation with the ISB hand-off brief. The SIB president/SIO should
     also include technical experts in deliberations to formulate valid findings and viable
     recommendations.
     5.5.2.2. Upon completion of their investigations, technical experts must provide a written
     report detailing results of their work (See Attachment 4).
     5.5.2.3. SIB presidents and SIOs must ensure a Safety Investigation Non-Disclosure
     Agreement (Figure A3.1.) on protection of privileged data is prepared and endorsed by
     all non-Air Force SIB members (e.g., contractors, NTSB, FAA, etc.) offered a promise of
     confidentiality or provided access to privileged information. Note: See paragraph 3.4.
     for safety investigations where a promise of confidentiality is authorized.
  5.5.3. Reports from Technical Experts.
     5.5.3.1. Reports from technical experts will be written for Part 1, Part 2, or both parts of
     the SIB report.
         5.5.3.1.1. A technical report written for Part 1 will contain observations, analysis,
         and conclusions based solely on physical evidence, other factual information, and
         statements provided without a promise of confidentiality. This includes factual
         information presented during SIB discussions where the technical expert is present.
         This also includes focus on key factual data, detailed system descriptions or
         background information when it supports a technical expert’s conclusion.
         Conclusions may address causes of the observed or documented conditions, but will
         NOT address the causes of the mishap. This does not preclude stating an opinion that
         a failure would likely create a certain condition, even if the mishap was inevitable
         under such a condition. Recommendations which relate to preventing the observed
         conditions may be included, but they will NOT address preventing the mishap. The
         SIB/SIO will thoroughly review all Part 1 reports from technical experts to ensure
         they do not contain privileged information. See Attachment 4 for the example
         Technical Expert Report Format, Part 1.
         5.5.3.1.2. A technical report written for Part 2 may contain analysis, conclusions and
         recommendations based on privileged information to include confidential statements,
         appointed SIB member deliberations, or proprietary company information. Part 2 of
         the technical report is not meant to duplicate information provided in Part 1, but to
         provide supplemental analysis and conclusions to assist the SIB in determining causes
         and recommendations. A Part 2 report is not required if technical expert analysis and
         conclusions can be based solely on physical evidence, other factual data, and
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                              59


           statements made without a promise of confidentiality. A signed Memorandum For
           Contractor Representatives Serving As Technical Experts To Safety
           Investigations (Figure A3.9.) will be placed in Tab W with any privileged technical
           reports.
           5.5.3.1.3. Contractor representatives requesting a claim of privilege/confidentiality of
           technical reports may submit a Part 2 only report, provided the Air Force maintains
           sole possession or control (paragraph 3.3.3.). In this case, see Attachment 4 and mark
           the entire document as a privileged report.
       5.5.3.2. If conflicting reports from different technical experts or laboratories are
       received, include both reports in the formal report. In the investigative narrative provide
       rationale explaining why one report is more applicable and why opposing views were
       discounted.
5.6. Controlling Information Collected by the SIB/SIO. SIB presidents/SIOs will ensure that
all information, privileged or not, collected by safety investigators is not released outside safety
channels except in accordance with this instruction.
   5.6.1. SIB presidents/SIOs will ensure that everyone working on their team is briefed on the
   restrictions. Every member of a safety investigation that produces a formal report will sign a
   Memorandum Documenting Guidance To Investigators On Controlling Information
   (Figure A3.11.) acknowledging the guidance and restrictions placed on information gathered
   during a safety investigation. The memorandum will be filed in Tab A of the formal report.
   5.6.2. The SIB/SIO is not prohibited from sharing information with technical experts who,
   although not members of a board, analyze information or wreckage on behalf of safety
   investigators.
   5.6.3. Part 1 information is releasable to the AIB. However, portions of Part 1 may not be
   releasable to the public since it may include information protected by the Privacy Act or
   Export Control Act contained in Part 1.
5.7. Investigative Evidence.
   5.7.1. Impounding Air Force Materiel/Wreckage. ISB/SIB/SIO activities have inherent
   priorities over other activities and investigations connected to the mishap (except criminal),
   including the right to impound Air Force property involved in the mishap. Group
   commanders or higher are required to act on their impoundment requests. However, safety
   of personnel (to include emergency response forces) and control of hazardous materials
   always take precedence over safety investigations, even at the risk of losing evidence. An
   installation commander in coordination with the ISB president, SIB president, or SIO may
   choose to remove wreckage interfering with essential mission activities or causing a hazard
   at the mishap scene. Wreckage may need to be removed or destroyed to prevent interference
   with operations or vital civil functions. If wreckage must be moved prior to the arrival of the
   SIB/SIO, thoroughly document the site (photographs, video) prior to moving.
       5.7.1.1. If there is potential for Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM) (ref AFI
       20-110, Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel Management) to be recovered as part of
       wreckage, the owning Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel Accountable Officer
       (NWRMAO) will notify the ISB/SIB/SIO and provide a list of NSNs, Nomenclatures,
60                                              AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


     and Serial Numbers.       The NWRMAO will assist with identifying any NWRM in
     wreckage.
     5.7.1.2. If impounding any material/wreckage, it is imperative to notify the local
     NWRMAO (ref AFI 20-110, Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel Management) of any
     NWRM assets identifiable in the material/wreckage. A listing of all NWRM assets
     recovered and in ISB/SIB/SIO custody must be provided to the NWRMAO detailing
     NSN, part number, location, and quantity of the assets identified.
     5.7.1.3. NWRM assets in custody of the ISB/SIB/SIO will not be shipped or transported
     to any other location unless coordinated through the NWRMAO.
     5.7.1.4. If transferring NWRM assets, the ISB/SIB/SIO must notify the NWRMAO
     when transferring NWRM assets to legal representatives. NWRM assets will be clearly
     identified and segregated while transferring custody.
  5.7.2. Life Sciences Evidence. The ISB/SIB/SIO will have access to many forms of Life
  Sciences evidence, including personal and protected health information. The ISB/SIB/SIO
  will comply with safety privilege and with the Privacy Act of 1974 to protect this
  information. Include only that medical and personal information that is relevant to the
  mishap or incident to avoid an unnecessary privacy violation of the individual(s). This
  includes physical exams, laboratory and radiological testing of survivors, personal
  equipment, aircrew flight equipment, medical/dental/mental health/substance abuse/family
  advocacy charts and past histories, initial medical interviews, and other information which
  points to the mental and physical capability of the personnel involved in the mishap. Human
  remains are also evidence. The SIB medical member should be aware of where all remains
  are and their status (i.e., awaiting autopsy, returned to family, etc.). Great care must be taken
  to ensure a positive chain of custody for all human remains. If any chain of custody issues
  arise, contact the CA immediately. Consult the mortuary officer of the supporting base to
  determine if civil authorities have jurisdiction over human remains. The mortuary officer
  should have an MOA/MOU with civil authorities according to AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs
  Program. Safety personnel, ISB and SIB medical members shall ensure AFMES is notified
  and given contact information for civil authorities exercising jurisdiction over human
  remains when a fatal mishap occurs.
  5.7.3. Shipping Investigative Evidence. Combat zones present unique challenges and, in
  certain cases such as RPA mishaps, evidence (e.g. data recorders, aircraft components,
  airframes or sections of airframes) may need to be shipped to a suitable location for analysis.
  The key to accomplishing this task is to treat all mishap evidence needing shipment for
  analysis as time-critical investigative evidence. Most investigative evidence will be shipped
  via the nearest (local) Traffic Management Office (TMO) or Distribution Flight, utilizing Air
  Force organizations and assets to the maximum extent possible. The shipping agency will set
  the priority of the cargo for channel flights IAW AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement of
  Air Force Cargo, Chapter 3. Investigative evidence will be priority coded TP-1. In some
  instances, the shipping agency may also need to provide a priority shipping letter to
  accompany the request. Time-critical investigative evidence, such as data recorders or
  suspect components, should be shipped via the most expedient method available, including
  the United States Postal Service or contractors such as FedEx, UPS, or DHL.
  5.7.4. Witnesses. Use the following guidelines for witnesses:
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                           61


     5.7.4.1. Ensure witness interviews and statements are conducted in a manner that is free
     of inappropriate influence or coercion and encourages disclosure of accurate information.
     Contact AFSEC/JA with questions regarding whether a particular interview technique is
     appropriate. If a witness provides a statement while under medication, add a notation of
     what medications they are taking to their statement.
     5.7.4.2. If a witness refuses to be interviewed, contact their commander, CA safety
     office, or AFSEC/JA.
     5.7.4.3. Do not have witnesses testify under oath. Ensure witnesses understand that they
     are obliged to give honest, good faith testimony. See paragraph 3.4. for a discussion on
     the promise of confidentiality.
     5.7.4.4. If a safety investigator believes Air Force personnel questioned in the
     investigation may be guilty of criminal misconduct, refer to paragraph 4.11.2.
     5.7.4.5. Interviewing witnesses suspected of criminal misconduct. If, after suspending a
     safety investigation because of potential criminal acts, the CA decides to continue the
     safety investigation, safety investigators may have to interview witnesses suspected of
     criminal misconduct. Contact AFSEC/JA if the SIB is required to interview suspected
     criminals.
     5.7.4.6. Retaining Access to Participants. Safety investigators may need frequent access
     to participants in a mishap. Commanders will make all participants available to the
     investigation upon request of the SIB president/SIO. The SIB president/SIO will advise
     the commander when participants are no longer needed.
     5.7.4.7. Returning Participants to Duty. Safety investigators make no determinations
     regarding the fitness of participants to be returned to normal duties. Commanders decide
     if and when participants are to be returned to duty.
     5.7.4.8. Commercial Space Launch Mishap. Refrain from interviewing witnesses until
     the NSTB investigator (or FAA investigator where the FAA is the lead) has arrived,
     unless there is a compelling reason to take the witness' statement(s) immediately (i.e.,
     transient witnesses).
     5.7.4.9. This instruction requires collecting and maintaining information protected by the
     Privacy Act of 1974 as amended at Title 5, United States Code, Section 552a.
         5.7.4.9.1. Safety investigators will request the SSN of military members and civilian
         employees involved in reportable mishaps. Inform individuals that the Privacy Act of
         1974 as amended at Title 5, United States Code, Section 552a, is the legal authority
         for requesting the SSN and that the SSN will only be used for safety mishap
         investigating and reporting.
  5.7.5. Disposing of Evidence.
     5.7.5.1. Operational assets. Once the investigation has recovered all necessary evidence
     from the asset involved in the mishap, the safety investigator will, at an appropriate time,
     advise the CA (after coordinating with the legal board if required) when the asset can be
     turned over to the owning unit. The legal board is responsible for operational assets
     given to them by the SIB. The CA is the final authority to release the asset to the owning
     unit. Exception: All wreckage from Class A space, aviation, and guided missile
 62                                              AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


       mishaps require a formal release from AFLOA/JACC before being released to the
       owning unit (paragraph 5.7.5.2.).
       5.7.5.2. Wreckage.
           5.7.5.2.1. After the SIB has gathered all necessary information from the wreckage,
           and there is a legal investigation, transfer custody of the wreckage to the legal board
           president in writing IAW AFMAN 91-22X.
           5.7.5.2.2. Release wreckage not needed in support of depot, laboratory, or the legal
           investigation to the host installation commander, in writing, for storage until the
           wreckage is released for disposal. AFLOA/JACC is the release authority for Class A
           space, aviation, and guided missile mishaps. The host legal office is the release
           authority for all other mishaps.
           5.7.5.2.3. All reasonable actions must be made to remove and properly dispose of
           wreckage. Special care must be given to the removal of all wreckage on private or
           state owned property.
       5.7.5.3. Other Evidence.
           5.7.5.3.1. For Class A mishaps, or when notified there will be a legal board for other
           mishaps, provide all non-privileged evidence (photographs, videotapes, data,
           documentation, and other evidence) to the legal board in writing IAW AFMAN 91-
           22X. The legal board will be responsible for final disposition of all material released
           to them by the SIB. For other than Class A mishaps, or when there is no legal board,
           contact the host installation staff judge advocate for guidance on disposing of
           materials that may be needed in potential claims or litigation. If there are no such
           requirements, reproduce enough copies for the safety report and then return the
           original documents and records used by the SIB to their proper custodian.
           5.7.5.3.2. In the case of fatalities, the disposition of human bodies and human tissue
           is dependent on who has legal jurisdiction over the remains; often this may be a local
           civilian coroner or medical examiner. Work with Mortuary Affairs and the local JA
           to clarify jurisdiction and disposition of human remains.
5.8. Hazard Analysis. Identify and document hazards that played a role in the mishap
sequence. Hazards are defined as "any real or potential condition that can cause injury or
occupational illness to personnel; damage to or loss of a system, equipment or property; or
damage to the environment". Determine whether individuals or management addressed these
hazards with the appropriate level of risk acceptance authority during preparation and execution
of the mishap sequence. The end result of a mishap investigation is the identification and
mitigation of hazards.
5.9. Determining and Documenting Factors.
   5.9.1. Factors. A factor is any deviation, out-of-the-ordinary, or deficient action or condition
   discovered in the course of a mishap investigation that in the board’s opinion contributed to
   the eventual outcome. Determining mishap factors (and eliminating non-factors) enables the
   investigators to focus the investigation from all the issues under examination to those specific
   areas that are significant in the mishap sequence. Factors explain why causes, such as pilot
   error, supervision, or equipment failure occurred. Factors are not mutually exclusive but are
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                            63


   often interrelated and in some cases influence each other. When applicable, include a
   discussion of related Human Factors using DoD Human Factors Analysis and Classification
   System (HFACS) (see Attachment 6). For example, in a spatial disorientation mishap
   include the human factors that contributed to the disorientation, such as channelized attention
   or distraction and how these were manifested. Note: The human factors codes in the Tab T,
   narrative, and AFSAS must all match.             Factors are the basis for findings and
   recommendations. Most mishaps involve multiple factors which may be causal or non-
   causal.
   5.9.2. Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion (NFWOD). NFWODs typically fall into one of
   three categories: areas uncovered during the investigation that did not cause the mishap or
   influence the outcome but should be fixed due to the potential to be a factor in a future
   mishap (e.g., incorrect information in a maintenance TO), areas that were thoroughly
   investigated and subsequently ruled out as factors (in order to provide context to the audience
   on why these areas are not factors), and areas that may be considered an interest item to the
   CA (e.g., risk management, crew resource management, etc.). NFWODs are the source for
   Other Findings and Recommendations of Significance.
   5.9.3. Non-Factors. Non-factors are a list of those areas/items the SIB considered, but
   determined not to be a factor in the mishap and not worthy of additional discussion. It is not
   an all-encompassing list, but rather a list of areas/items the SIB investigated and ruled out.
   5.9.4. For system-related mishaps, determine whether the SPO previously identified the
   hazards that played a role in the mishap sequence and had included those hazards in its
   OSS&E (Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness) risk management efforts. All
   system-related Class A and B mishaps should include a SPO analysis of hazards that
   contributed to the mishap and recommendations for materiel risk mitigation measures,
   especially those that minimize potential human errors.
   5.9.5. See Attachment 7 for factors, findings, and recommendations relationships.
5.10. Determining and Documenting Findings.
   5.10.1. Findings are based on the weight of evidence, professional knowledge, and good
   judgment. All mishaps will have findings. Exception: For those mishaps which fall
   exclusively under the descriptions outlined in paragraphs 1.10.3.2., 1.10.4.2., and 1.10.5.
   findings are optional.
   5.10.2. Each finding is a single event or condition. Each finding is an essential step in the
   mishap sequence, but each finding is not necessarily causal. Findings must be concise (one
   sentence) and will not include any more information than is necessary to explain the event.
   5.10.3. Each finding must have a logical connection to preceding findings. If no logical
   relationship exists, the sequence of the mishap has not been correctly described.
   5.10.4. Ensure critical events required to sustain the mishap sequence have not been omitted.
   Conversely, do not include events interesting to the reader, but not necessary to sustain the
   mishap sequence.
   5.10.5. In some cases the sequence begins long before the actual mishap sequence with such
   things as design problems, improperly written directives, or an inadequate training program.
64                                              AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


  5.10.6. Ensure the sequence continues to the point where all damage or injury has occurred
  and the initial rescue or recovery actions are completed.
  5.10.7. Include injuries occurring in the mishap at the appropriate chronological point in the
  event sequence. For example, insert ejection injury events occurring before the aircraft-
  ground impact finding at the proper chronological point. Injuries or fatalities suffered by
  persons on the ground following a crash would be at the end of the main sequence (e.g., "the
  Range Safety Officer successfully initiated the self-destruct sequence; debris from the launch
  booster crashed into a fishing boat, fatally injuring two people" or "the pilot ejected
  successfully; the aircraft crashed in a parking lot adjacent to the runway, fatally injuring two
  persons").
  5.10.8. Findings are arranged in chronological order. Number the findings consecutively.
  Precede each number with the word "Finding" (e.g., Finding 1, Finding 2, etc.).
  5.10.9. Write each finding as a full sentence, not bullet points. Use past tense, since the
  events occurred in the past. (Example: Incorrect – Crew chief clears pilot from chocks and
  the pilot taxis to runway. Correct – The crew chief cleared the pilot from the chocks and the
  pilot taxied to the runway.)
  5.10.10. When the safety investigator cannot pinpoint a correctable event in a sequence, list
  as much of the sequence as can be supported and insert a statement relating to the
  undetermined area. If there are supportable alternatives identify them as such and list them.
  Show them as subordinate to the applicable finding by using a format such as "event X most
  likely occurred due to one or more of the following reasons".
     5.10.10.1. The reasons should be listed from most probable to least probable.
     5.10.10.2. Do not list all of the possible alternatives that could have existed merely
     because they cannot be eliminated. Place this sort of conjecture in the analysis and
     narrative.
  5.10.11. Do not include people’s names, call signs, names of Air Force bases or companies
  in the findings. Use terms such as "the mishap aircraft," "the mishap flight lead," "the
  mishap wingman," "the mishap pilot," "the mishap crew," "the mishap instructor
  loadmaster," "the mishap evaluator boom operator," or "the mishap crew chief." Be specific,
  but do not include supporting evidence in the findings. The report narrative includes
  supporting evidence and conclusions.
  5.10.12. Findings shall not include new material not addressed in the narrative. If the
  finding is not identifiable in the narrative, the narrative was not written completely.
  5.10.13. After developing the findings, apply the following "Findings Test" for validation:
     5.10.13.1. Is the Finding necessary to sustain the mishap sequence?
     5.10.13.2. Is the Finding a single event or condition?
     5.10.13.3. Is the Finding specific enough without including supporting evidence?
     5.10.13.4. Does the Finding logically connect to the preceding finding? Read the last
     finding; ask "why?" then read the finding above, does it answer the "why?", continue for
     each finding.
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                             65


      5.10.13.5. Is the Finding relevant or simply interesting to the reader?
5.11. Determining and Documenting Causes.
   5.11.1. A cause is a deficiency, which if corrected, eliminated, or avoided, would likely have
   prevented or mitigated the mishap damage or injury. Cause does not imply blame. The
   intent is to identify the root cause(s) where corrective action is needed.
   5.11.2. Findings that sustained the mishap sequence, but were normal to the situation as it
   developed are not causal. In most instances a causal finding is correctable by commanders,
   supervisors, or individuals.
   5.11.3. Apply the reasonable person concept when determining a cause. If a person’s
   performance or judgment was reasonable considering the mishap circumstances, do not
   assign cause. It is not appropriate to expect extraordinary or unique superior performance in
   such cases. Human factors (physiological or psychological) may be causal even though they
   are reasonable. These are often the unavoidable effects of a preceding cause.
   5.11.4. Do not list a party as causal for not taking an action unless they should reasonably
   have been expected to take such action, but they did not. Similar rationale applies to lack of
   a system or procedure. Do not list failure to provide a system or procedure as causal unless a
   party should reasonably have been expected to do so given the information available prior to
   the mishap.
   5.11.5. Risk management is an expected function for all organizations, and improper risk
   management is considered a deficiency that can be causal in a mishap. (See guidance in AFI
   91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and AFI 90-802, Risk Management).
   In cases where a mishap has identified hazards there is a responsibility to assess the
   associated risks, evaluate risk mitigation options, implement risk management measures,
   evaluate the residual risks, document approval at the appropriate level (see AFI 91-202, The
   US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, Chapter 11) to accept the expected residual risks
   in terms of consequences and probability of occurrence, and monitor the effectiveness of the
   risk control measures implemented. Each recurrence of a mishap requires a reassessment of
   the prior risk management decisions. Do not cite risk acceptance as a causal finding when all
   risk management functions were properly accomplished and a quantified level of risk was
   accepted at the appropriate level.
   5.11.6. Not every finding is causal. Some are effects or the expected result of a previously
   identified cause even though their inclusion sustains the sequence leading to the mishap. An
   engine flameout precipitated by a fuel boost pump failure is the expected result of the boost
   pump failure and is not causal. The boost pump failure may have been a result of an even
   earlier cause such as a bearing failure. Likewise, the initiating event may not be causal if the
   SIB determines that a safe recovery with existing procedures was reasonable, but deficient
   follow-on decisions, actions, or events caused the damage/injury (i.e., an in-flight emergency
   the crew should have been reasonably expected to safely recover).
   5.11.7. Environmental conditions such as a bird strike, lightning, high wind, solar wind,
   meteorites, or flood may be causal only if all reasonable avoidance and damage/injury
   mitigation actions were taken.
66                                              AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


  5.11.8. The action that could have prevented a failure resides within the human realm and
  not on an object or publication. Publications or objects should almost never be found causal.
  Rather, the party responsible for ensuring the publications are correct or the party responsible
  for ensuring an object does not fail with catastrophic consequences is causal, unless the party
  took all reasonably expected actions. In such cases, there may be process or organizational
  failures, and appropriate parties may be identified as responsible for these failures.
     5.11.8.1. The intent of identifying causal parties in an investigation is to identify the
     point where corrective action is needed, not to place blame. As such, safety investigators
     need to ensure they identify the correct causal agent. This can be done by asking "why"
     something occurred until the investigator comes to a "dead end".
  5.11.9. Occasionally an investigator may not be able to conclusively determine a specific
  causal event. In these special cases, the investigator may choose to list two or three of the
  most probable causes for each option. In rare instances the causal event may be unknown.
  5.11.10. Causal findings should always be worded in active voice, clearly identifying the
  actor(s) and causal action (deficiency), along with any necessary explanation. Examples:
  Passive – No safety pins were installed in the widget. Active – The mishap crew chief failed
  to install safety pins in the widget as required by tech orders due to inattention. Passive –
  Mission planning did not cover en-route obstacles. Active – The mishap crew failed to
  address en-route obstacles in mission planning as required due to complacency.
  5.11.11. Identify causal findings by adding the word "Causal" to the beginning of the finding
  statement or by selecting the “Causal” button in AFSAS when entering findings. Do not list
  causes under a separate heading. Word a causal finding as a clear and simple statement of a
  single condition or event. Causal findings must have a supporting factor detailed in the
  analysis/formal report.
  5.11.12. Causal findings should identify the causal agent (who), the action taken (what), and
  (why) the reason for the deficiency. Why the action (or lack of action) occurred should be
  fully explained in the narrative and may be included in the causal finding. For example “Due
  to complacency, the mishap pilot failed to extend the landing gear prior to touchdown.”
     5.11.12.1. Only the overarching causal human factor should be included in the causal
     finding. Contributing human factors should be explained in the narrative and input to
     AFSAS.
  5.11.13. After determining the causal findings, apply the following "Cause Test" for
  validation:
     5.11.13.1. Is the causal finding correctable by commanders, supervisors or individuals?
     5.11.13.2. Is the causal finding a clear and simple statement of a single condition or
     event?
     5.11.13.3. Is the causal finding in the active voice and does it follow the format: Who
     did what to whom/what and why?
     5.11.13.4. Is the causal finding an effect or an expected result of a previously identified
     cause, even though its inclusion sustains the mishap sequence? If so, it is not causal.
  5.11.14. See Attachment 7 for factors, findings, and recommendations relationships.
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                               67


5.12. Determining and Documenting Recommendations.
   5.12.1. Recommendations are feasible and effective solutions to eliminate identified hazards,
   or if the hazard cannot be eliminated, to mitigate the hazard’s potential consequences. If no
   recommendations are made in an on-duty Class A or B investigation, investigators will
   explain their rationale in the report narrative. Ensure the investigation supports the
   recommendations. Do not make recommendations for the sole purpose of having
   recommendations.
   5.12.2. Developing feasible and effective recommendations is a methodical process, which
   seeks to identify risk mitigation alternatives. It is essential to know precisely what
   deficiency, or identified hazard, is being addressed and to stay focused on it.
   5.12.3. All recommendations should target one or more of the hazards identified and
   documented during the investigation. It is also sometimes prudent to make two or more
   recommendations against one hazard. Developing sound recommendations also requires
   recognition of the "order of precedence" concept, which recognizes that not all risk
   mitigation alternatives are equal. Design fixes is the most preferable solution because they
   can often completely eliminate the hazard, but these types of fixes often have the highest
   upfront costs. In all cases use the order of precedence to develop risk mitigation alternatives.
   As an example, to eliminate or mitigate the identified hazard of "pilot’s failure to command
   landing gear extension," which results in a gear-up landing of a training aircraft, one might
   consider the following:
      5.12.3.1. Design: Implement a fixed gear.
      5.12.3.2. Incorporate Safety Devices: Implement an auto-extend system.
      5.12.3.3. Provide Warning Devices: Implement cockpit warning lights, warning tone or
      voice.
      5.12.3.4. Develop Training and Procedures: Improve the written checklist, or its use via
      training with instructors and in simulators.
   5.12.4. Based upon the specific information discovered during the investigation, selected
   alternatives should be formulated into feasible and effective recommendations and other
   alternatives discarded. The purpose of using the “order of precedence” is to ensure
   investigators consider the entire range of available options and not just the cheap and easy
   ones – which usually have the least mishap prevention value.
   5.12.5. A great deal of debate usually surrounds what is feasible and effective. Sometimes a
   risk mitigation alternative is technically feasible and effective, but it is clearly not
   economically feasible or has unacceptable mission consequences. In this case, discard the
   alternative. In other cases it may not be clear that an alternative is either technically feasible
   or economically feasible. In these cases, include a recommendation for formal evaluation.
   5.12.6. Most recommendations will be associated with causal findings, but not all causal
   findings will have recommendations. For example, a causal finding may not have a
   recommendation if the deficiency is already prohibited in command guidance (AFI, TO,
   etc.). Likewise, findings that are not causal may also have recommendations written against
   them.
68                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


  5.12.7. Recommendations may also vary in scope. Some actions can be taken at unit level.
  Other recommendations require MAJCOM or other agency actions.
  5.12.8. If a recommendation depends on tests or analyses that are incomplete when the
  report is transmitted, explain this and provide a reference to the tests or analyses (e.g.
  deficiency report, study, or contract number).
  5.12.9. Recommendations should require the action agency to correct a deficiency rather
  than to implement a particular solution. The action agency normally has greater expertise
  than the investigators and should be given the opportunity to develop the optimal solution for
  a problem. The following examples illustrate this point: Poor – Move the right engine fire
  pushbutton to the right side of the cockpit. Better – Implement changes to the engine fire
  pushbuttons to help preclude engine shutdown errors.
  5.12.10. Avoid recommendations that only require a study or evaluation. Action should be
  required based upon results of any recommended study. In most cases it is not necessary to
  recommend a study or evaluation since studies or evaluations are implicit in the process. The
  recommendation can simply require corrective action. Examples: Poor – Evaluate the
  feasibility of changes to the anti-lock system. Better – Implement changes to the anti-lock
  system to prevent loss of feedback.
  5.12.11. General, vague, sweeping, or open-ended recommendations that cannot be closed
  by the action agency are not appropriate. Write recommendations that have a definitive
  closing action.
  5.12.12. Do not recommend briefing personnel on the mishap. Such a briefing is a basic
  commander responsibility and a normal function of safety offices at all levels of command.
  5.12.13. Do not recommend reminding (or commanders reminding/briefing/publishing an
  FCIF to remind) personnel of the importance of simply doing their jobs properly. However,
  recommendations to place CAUTIONS and WARNINGS in TO guidance relating the
  adverse consequences of not doing one’s job properly may be appropriate.
  Recommendations for specific action such as refresher training, implementing in-process
  inspections, etc., to ensure job duties are being properly performed may also be appropriate
  since they are specific and can be closed.
  5.12.14. Include only one statement for each recommendation. Rather than sub-grouping
  recommendations (e.g., 1a, 1b, 1c, etc.), use a new recommendation number. Do not create a
  recommendation in AFSAS to state that there are no recommendations.
  5.12.15. Recommendations to Change Publications.
     5.12.15.1. Recommendations may be made to change publications, technical orders,
     flight manuals, or checklists. Submit AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
     Publication (flight publications), according to AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program
     (FMP). Submit AFTO Form 22, Technical Manual Change Recommendation and Reply,
     according to TO 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order System. Use local base support
     personnel (Stan Eval and/or Quality Assurance (QA)) for assistance in completing the
     forms. If the proposed change is time sensitive, use the emergency critical safety hazard
     message format in AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program (FMP), or the emergency report
     format in TO 00-5-1.
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                        69


     5.12.15.1. (AFGSC) Send AFGSC/SE and NAF/SE a courtesy copy of AFTO 22,
     Technical Manual (TM) Change Recommendation and Reply, or AF Form 847,
     Recommendation for Change of Publication. Ensure the mishap number and releasable
     descriptions of the mishap are included on the applicable form.
     5.12.15.2. If applicable, obtain the tracking number from MAJCOM Stan Eval for AF
     Forms 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, and unit QA for AFTO Forms
     22, Technical Manual Change Recommendation and Reply. Place the tracking number
     and the mishap’s AFSAS number on the submitted forms to ensure these
     recommendations receive the appropriate levels of review. Also, place the tracking
     number after corresponding recommendation in the final message/report. Submit
     completed forms to the MAJCOM Stan Eval or LG Command Control Point (CCP), as
     applicable after the investigation is complete (paragraph 6.5.).
     5.12.15.3. In all cases, protect privileged safety information by sanitizing (paragraph
     3.7.1.) the "reason for recommended change" section of AFTO Form 22, Technical
     Manual Change Recommendation and Reply or AF Form 847, Recommendation for
     Change of Publication. The SIB/SIO will place copies of the submitted forms in the
     applicable formal report tab.
  5.12.16. Determining the appropriate action agencies for each recommendation.
     5.12.16.1. Assign action agencies for all recommendations. An OPR is required for
     every recommendation. Although an office of collateral responsibility (OCR) is not
     required, they are appropriate for many recommendations. List only one OPR per
     recommendation. More than one OCR may be listed for an individual recommendation.
     Limit OPR and OCR assignment to two or three-digit organizational levels to ensure
     proper management level attention.
     5.12.16.1. (AFGSC) Recommendations for action agencies above wing level for Class
     A, B, and C mishaps will be coordinated through the convening authority SE, via e-mail
     or telephone prior to report submission, to ensure proper agencies are appointed.
     5.12.16.2. Assign OPRs and OCRs based upon the lead command and user command
     philosophy. The Air Force assigns responsibility for overall management of each system
     to a "lead command" to ensure that all requirements associated with every system receive
     comprehensive and equitable consideration. This lead command provides primary input
     into the process of developing and maintaining a force structure with a balance of
     complementary capabilities, and it establishes a basis for rational allocation of scarce
     resources among competing requirements. See AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation
     and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems, for more information.
     5.12.16.3. Normally, if a recommendation requires funding to effect changes to a
     weapon system (e.g., performing risk analyses or engineering studies, developing aircraft
     or component modifications, obtaining new test or support equipment, etc.), assign the
     appropriate office for the mishap weapon system within the lead command as OPR. If
     the lead command only provides funds for the effort and another organization is
     responsible for performing or managing the work, assign these organizations as OCRs.
     For example: Implement changes to the B-1 to reduce the probability of encountering
     "hot brake" temperatures. OPR: ACC/A8A, OCR: AFLCMC/WWN. In this example
70                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


     ACC/A8A is assigned as OPR because, as the appropriate office in the lead command,
     they would be responsible to arrange for the funding required to effect changes to the
     aircraft. Assuming that funding is provided, the B-1 system program office at
     AFLCMC/WWN is assigned as OCR since they would either perform the required work
     in-house or manage the contracted effort.
     5.12.16.4. Not all funding comes from the lead command. Sometimes it is possible for a
     system program office, item management office, laboratory or other organization to fund
     efforts through separate budgets. If a recommendation does not require funding from the
     lead command to effect changes to a weapon system (e.g., performing risk analyses or
     engineering studies, developing and obtaining preferred spares, developing inspection
     techniques and procedures, simple modifications and testing of software in conjunction
     with scheduled updates, limited flight and ground testing, etc.), assign the appropriate
     office that has the funding as OPR. Assign OCRs as required. Should the OPR choose
     not to implement the recommendation, the recommendation will be transferred to the lead
     command for risk acceptance during the Mishap Review Panel (MRP).
     5.12.16.5. Although changes to training programs, training equipment, and publishing
     new or changed paper documents (e.g., Air Force Policy Directives, AFIs, flight manuals,
     TOs, etc.) require funding, assign the organization responsible for controlling the content
     of these products as OPR. Assign OCRs as required. For any change requested to AETC
     Technical Training courses, the appropriate Air Force Specialty Code Career Field
     Manager is the appropriate OPR.
     5.12.16.6. Sometimes the responsibility for a recommendation lies outside the Air Force
     (e.g., the FAA for various air traffic control issues). Since the Air Force may not have
     the authority to task such agencies to perform recommended actions, do not assign non-
     Air Force agencies as OPRs or OCRs. In these cases, write the recommendation as an
     Air Force action and assign the appropriate Air Force organization as OPR. This Air
     Force organization is typically responsible for interaction with or contractual oversight of
     the outside agency and will ensure proper recommendation evaluation and disposition.
     Assign OCRs as required.
     5.12.16.7. Field Operating Agencies (FOA) normally accomplish Air Force-level
     actions. For example, air traffic issues are managed by the Air Force Flight Standards
     Agency (AFFSA), not the Deputy Chief of Staff for Air and Space Operations
     (AF/A3/5). However, the Air Staff may be tasked as an OPR/OCR, where appropriate.
     5.12.16.8. SIB/SIO is responsible for coordinating all recommendations with their
     proposed action agencies (OPR and OCR). Ensure the correct OPR and OCR(s) are
     identified through positive contact (call or email them) prior to publishing the formal
     report or final message. Include the name, office symbol, telephone number, and email
     address of one OPR action officer for each recommendation. Place this information in
     the dedicated data field provided by AFSAS. The CA safety staff will ensure the
     SIB/SIO has made positive contact with the OPR and OCR(s).
  5.12.17. See Attachment 7 for factors, findings, and recommendations relationships.
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                           71


5.13. Determining and Documenting Other Findings and Recommendations of
Significance (OFS, ORS). Guidance for developing and documenting primary findings and
recommendations applies similarly to OFSs and ORSs.
   5.13.1. OFS are findings that the safety investigators believe could contribute to future
   mishaps and/or warrant command attention, but were not part of the mishap sequence. OFS
   should be listed following the mishap recommendations in message and formal reports.
   5.13.2. ORS are recommendations resulting from OFS. Each OFS will be followed by one
   or more corresponding ORS. Assign an OPR and OCR(s) to each ORS.
   5.13.2. (AFGSC) Other recommendations of significance (ORS) will be routed through
   AFGSC channels for informational purposes only. When required, HQ AFGSC OPRs for
   such recommendations assume responsibility for advocating corrective actions from agencies
   outside of AFGSC. Attach such recommendations to the memorandum of transmittal to all
   AFGSC addressees and each non-AFGSC recommendation OPR.
5.14. Releasing Investigative Information During an Active Safety Investigation. It is Air
Force policy to keep the public informed of Air Force mishaps and safety investigations and to
release non-privileged information, both favorable and unfavorable. Air Force policy complies
with the requirements of Title 10, United States Code, Section 2254(b) regarding the public
disclosure of certain non-privileged aircraft accident investigation information. The SIB
president approves the release of all information (including electronic/digital media,
photographs, etc.) from the SIB, but will not communicate directly with the media or other
members of the public. The release of non-privileged information to news media, relatives, and
other agencies is through the AIB president, Survivor Assistance Program point of contact,
Family Liaison Officer, or Public Affairs representative as appropriate.
   5.14.1. The CA or designated information officer releases factual information about a
   mishap, including photographs, only as directed in AFI 35-104, Media Operations, AFI 35-
   109, Visual Information, AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations, and AFI 51-507,
   Ground Accident Investigations. Officials involved in the safety investigation are not
   permitted to be the officials releasing the information to the media or other members of the
   public.
   5.14.2. The AIB, IAW AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations, or Ground AIB, in
   IAW AFI 51-507, Ground Accident Investigations, can release factual mishap information
   upon request. If an AIB is not formed, the local commander, through the public affairs or
   legal office, may release factual information. Information will not be released if it will
   jeopardize national defense, impede an ongoing or pending investigation (including the SIB
   or AIB), or if it is privileged safety information. The SIB president will coordinate with the
   AIB president as to whether the release of information will impede the SIB’s investigation.
   5.14.3. Following mishaps where AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations, does not
   apply (nuclear, explosives and chemical agents, and directed energy) the CA through the
   public affairs or legal office may release factual information. Information will not be
   released if it will jeopardize national defense, impede an ongoing or pending investigation
   (including the SIB or legal investigation) or if it is privileged safety information. The SIB
   president will coordinate with the legal release authority as to whether the release of
   information will impede the SIB's investigation.
 72                                               AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


5.15. Coordinating with the Legal Board.
   5.15.1. The SIB president provides Part 1 of the formal report and certain factual
   information to the AIB president as soon as possible (prior to completion of the
   investigation). See discipline specific safety manual for further guidance.
      5.15.1.1. Examples of information given to the legal board president include (this list
      contains examples only): a list of witnesses, cockpit and tower audio recordings, data
      recorders, coroner’s report, autopsy report, toxicology test results, police reports,
      personnel and medical records. Note: Transferred records should be the whole, original
      source record (hard copy) and not printouts from AFSAS or documents that have been
      screened, selected, edited, or marked by the SIB.
      5.15.1.1. (AFGSC) Examine photographs taken for investigations do not contain images
      of classified components. Ensure classified images are removed, sanitized or marked
      appropriately prior to releasing/transmitting.
   5.15.2. Persons occupying full-time safety positions routinely examine privileged
   documents. They are not permitted to serve on legal investigations as long as they are
   performing full-time safety duties. Legal investigators will not attend SIB/SIO proceedings,
   or meetings, or have access to or discuss any Part 2 privileged information with the SIB/SIO
   or Air Force safety officials. This prohibition also applies to the briefing given to the CA on
   the safety investigation results.
   5.15.3. ISB/SIB members, or SIO, will not be witnesses for other boards investigating the
   same mishap except to provide Part 1 factual information or to provide purely factual
   information within their knowledge that is not otherwise available.
   5.15.4. ISB/SIB members, or SIO, and technical advisors will not act as investigators or
   technical advisors for a legal investigation of the same mishap.
   5.15.5. Ensure the AIB president knows the disposition of all non-privileged evidence, to
   include wreckage and components shipped for analysis. The AIB must acknowledge their
   custodial responsibility in writing which is included in Tab Q of the formal report. Provide
   all non-privileged evidence (photographs, videotapes, data, documentation, and other
   evidence) to the legal board in writing IAW AFMAN 91-22X. The legal board will be
   responsible for final disposition of all material released to them by the SIB. If the AIB
   president is not available and the SIB is prepared to release the evidence, release it to the host
   installation SJA, who will maintain custody until the AIB president is able to accept.

                                       REPORTS AND BRIEFINGS

6.1. General Information. Safety reports include messages (preliminary, 10-day, status, final,
and final supplemental), formal reports, and injury and occupational illness forms and logs.
Safety reporting will be via the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS). Use the
following URL for AFSAS: https://afsas.kirtland.af.mil. If AFSAS is not available, see
paragraph 3.6. for transmission alternatives. Once the SIB/SIO completes the investigation and
finalizes the formal report and the final message, the SIB/SIO will normally provide a briefing to
the CA. Aviation mishaps involving fatalities, or other mishaps when requested, require a
briefing to the CSAF and SECAF. AF/SEI will be the focal point for scheduling all briefings to
the CSAF and SECAF.
   6.1.1. Make every effort to keep investigative reports and briefings unclassified to ensure the
   widest dissemination possible. Report the unclassified portion of the report (One
   liner/Date/Time/Location/Investigating Officer/Objects) using AFSAS. Do NOT input DoD
   Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (DCNI) into AFSAS. Report classified mishap
   information (narrative/recommendations/findings) via SIPRnet using discipline-specific
   formatting IAW applicable AFMAN 91-22X.

6 = This timeline includes 30 days to complete the investigation, up to 15 days to outbrief, and 3 days to
release the final message. In all mishaps, if the SIB outbriefs the CA earlier, then the final message is
due within 3 days of the brief. RPA timelines to release final messages are 63 days for CONUS
mishaps, 78 days for outside the continental United States mishaps.
7 = If a Space mishap involves personnel (i.e., manned spaceflight) or nuclear material, preliminary
reporting timeline will be 8 hours.

  6.2.1. Guidelines.
          6.2.1.1. Table 6.1 provides message reporting timelines.
      6.2.1.2. Do not include Privacy Act information in messages, to include but not limited
      to, names and social security numbers.
      6.2.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) Telephonic/email Reports. The following telephonic/email
      reports are also required for AFGSC units:
          6.2.1.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) The owning unit safety office will make a telephonic
          and email report NLT four hours after learning of a Class A mishap (Attachment 9).
          Contact the appropriate HQ AFGSC Safety office during duty hours. Contact HQ
          AFGSC/SE through the HQ AFGSC Command Post during non-duty hours.
          6.2.1.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) For Class A aviation, weapons or on - duty ground
          mishaps involving human factors, the director of wing/base medical services (or the
          designated representative) will make a telephonic report to the HQ AFGSC
          Aerospace Medicine Branch (AFGSC/SGPF) within twenty-four hours after learning
          of a mishap (Attachment 10). Make report directly to HQ AFGSC/SGPF during
          duty hours; make the report to the HQ AFGSC/SG Staff Alert Officer through the HQ
          AFGSC Command Post during non-duty hours.
          6.2.1.3.3. (Added-AFGSC) In addition to the above, the following message reports
          are required for Class A aviation, weapons, and on-duty ground mishaps. The
          owning unit wing safety staff will assist in the preparation of these reports:
              6.2.1.3.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3 will make a telephonic report to
              HQ AFGSC/SE within four hours on mishaps involving aircraft being ferried
              under HQ AFGSC/A3 movement control.
              6.2.1.3.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/SE and the owning NAF Safety
              office will notify their respective staff judge advocates upon determination that an
              aviation mishap might be a Class A.
          6.2.1.3.4. (Added-AFGSC) For Class B aviation, weapons and on-duty ground
          mishaps, the safety office of a mishap unit will make a telephonic and email
          notification to the owning NAF safety office using the procedures in paragraph
          6.2.1.3.1
  6.2.2. Preliminary Message. The first electronically transmitted safety message advising of
  a non-nuclear mishap or event is entitled Preliminary Message. Preliminary messages are
  fully releasable. They will contain factual information only and will not contain safety-
  protected or privileged information. A preliminary message requires a narrative which
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                            75


  includes enough detail so that the reader can get a grasp of the significant events of the
  mishap. Although OPREP-3 reports do not satisfy this requirement, safety personnel should
  coordinate with the Command Post on OPREPs generated as a result of a mishap to ensure
  no inaccurate or privileged information is released.
  6.2.3. 10-Day Message. For Class A and B mishaps, this is usually the first privileged report
  released by the appointed SIB. The intent is for the SIB to communicate the status of the
  investigation and to relay any pertinent information, privileged or not, the SIB deems
  necessary to report at this time.
  6.2.4. Status Messages. Status messages are sent to explain report delays/extensions, a SIB
  temporarily deconvening, relocating, or to relay new information discovered since the
  previous message. If the status message is explaining a safety report delay/extension, explain
  the reason for the delay, the expected completion date, and extension approval from the CA.
  Safety investigators may send status messages as they deem necessary. Required status
  messages are listed in Table 6.1.
     6.2.4.1. The CA’s safety staff will closely follow mishaps that have damage estimates
     close to the threshold limits or injuries/occupational illnesses that have the potential for
     improving or worsening.
     6.2.4.2. A status message is required as soon as a mishap class or category changes, e.g.,
     due to updated damage cost figures, a subsequent death from mishap injuries, or
     erroneous initial categorization.
     6.2.4.3. (Added-AFGSC) For all Class A, the SIB president will provide a
     telephone/email update to HQ AFGSC/SE on a weekly basis or whenever there are
     significant developments in the investigation. For selected Class B mishaps, the NAF/SE
     will provide a telephone/email update to AFGSC/SE on a weekly basis or whenever there
     are significant developments in the investigation.
  6.2.5. Final Message. The final message will be released in AFSAS within 3 duty days after
  the CA accepts the briefing. This message provides a narrative of the mishap/event
  sequence, states the mishap cause, and recommends preventive actions. It contains the
  investigation, analysis, and conclusions of the safety investigator. It is written so the reader
  clearly understands how the findings and causes were determined and clearly states the role
  of the individuals found causal in the mishap sequence. Include logic in how the
  recommendations were chosen as well as OPR/OCRs for the recommendations. The
  message may also include OFS and ORS, which do not relate directly to the causes of the
  mishap, but can be of value in risk management and mishap prevention. The final message is
  privileged. Complete the investigation and prepare the final message within the time limits
  specified in Table 6.1. The CA safety staff will release the final message after the
  investigation is complete (paragraph 6.6.). DO NOT delay release of the final message for
  staffing internal command comments or cost/injury analysis. DO NOT release the final
  message before completion of the formal report (tabs), unless the formal report is waived.
     6.2.5.1. If a final message needs to be changed after it is completed, all primary SIB
     members must coordinate on all changes, as only the primary SIB members are
     authorized to change the report. The discipline specific safety manuals (AFMAN 91-
     22X) provide guidance on primary SIB members.
 76                                              AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


   6.2.6. Final Supplemental Message. A final supplemental message is released whenever the
   SIB/SIO has to make changes to the final message (e.g. final message was returned, new
   information uncovered, identified errors, or tab errors). Include in the summary of changes a
   short description of what was altered in the report.
   6.2.7. Comments for Memorandum of Final Evaluation (MOFE) Message. Individuals or
   organizations will submit a Comments for MOFE message in AFSAS within 45 calendar
   days of Class A or B final message (or final supplemental message) release (paragraph 7.3.).
   See Attachment 5 for format requirements.
   6.2.8. MOFE Message. The MOFE message is released within 90 days of an on-duty Class
   A or select Class B final message (or final supplemental message). It contains the AF/SE’s
   final position on the mishap.
6.3. Formal Reports. Formal reports present detailed factual and analytical information about
mishaps. AFSAS is the only acceptable method for mishap reporting. Formal reports will be
uploaded as tabs into AFSAS. All Class A and B mishaps require a formal report unless
exempted by AFMAN 91-22X or waived by the Air Force Chief of Safety (AF/SE). The CA or
AF/SE may also require a formal report for any other mishap if determined necessary. Note:
Class A and B off-duty military mishaps normally do not require a formal report. See AFMAN
91-224, Ground Safety Investigations and Reports, for additional guidance.
6.3. (AFGSC)Formal Reports. Prior to final release of all Class A and B mishap reports in
AFSAS, the IO will add the owning MAJCOM (AFGSC/AFRC/ANG) as Optional Approval in
item 14 on the “create final message” screen. This action will allow a final review for accuracy
and completeness. This is a review only; the owning MAJCOM will not release the report.
After review, the report with any recommended changes will be returned to the owning
organization for final release. Barring any extenuating circumstance, this review will be
completed within no more than 2 duty days of receipt.
   6.3.1. Privileged formal reports contain three parts: Part 1, Factual Information and
   Releasable Material, Part 2, Board Conclusions and Non-releasable Material, and Part 3,
   Other Material. See discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X) for tab waiver
   procedures and authority.
        6.3.1.1. Part 1 contains factual information that may be disclosed outside the Air Force;
        Part 2 contains privileged safety information and will not be displayed/disclosed outside
        Air Force Safety channels (see Chapter 3), and Part 3 contains the final briefing in
        various formats (e.g. with and without privacy and privileged information included).
        Questions about handling and/or distribution of safety report information should be
        referred to AFSEC/JA.
        6.3.1.2. Tabs. Table 6.2. contains tab designations for Parts 1, 2, and 3. See discipline
        specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X) for specific guidance on tab usage and
        contents.

 1B     SIO/SIB Final Briefing with Privacy Information Removed
 78                                              AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


  1C        SIO/SIB Final Briefing with Privacy and Privileged Information Removed

   6.3.2. MAJCOMs or AF/SE may direct preparation of a formal report for any mishap, even
   under circumstances where this instruction does not specifically require one.
   6.3.3. Distributing the Formal Report.
       6.3.3.1. The CA will ensure all non-waivered formal reports are uploaded into AFSAS.
       All Air Force agencies with a need to know will be able to access the tabs or request tab
       access via AFSAS. Do not provide copies or extracts to agencies outside the Air Force.
       If an agency outside the Air Force needs a copy of the formal report for mishap
       prevention, corrective actions, or other purpose, notify AFSEC/JA. For the AIB
       handover, Part 1 of the formal report will be provided electronically (CD, DVD, secured
       shared drive, etc.).
       6.3.3.2. Do not produce "information only" copies of formal reports.
       6.3.3.3. The SIB president may keep a complete copy of the formal report until all
       briefings are completed.
       6.3.3.4. The uploading of formal report tab files into AFSAS will be as a single .pdf
       document. See discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X) for specific guidance
       on tab contents and exceptions.
6.4. Convening Authority Formal Report Quality Control. The CA safety staff will assess
the entire report, including AFSAS database field entries, final message, and completed tabs to
determine overall adequacy and to ensure the SIB/SIO followed formatting and investigative
guidance established in both AFI 91-204 and AFMAN 91-22X. Additionally, although AFSAS
has an error check capability, CA SEs will review AFSAS data fields prior to the release of the
final message for accuracy (i.e., mishap category, mishap class, mishap cost, one-liner, etc.).
The review will also include verifying the DoD HFACS codes entered into AFSAS are supported
by the SIB’s analysis in the Tab T and final message, which ensures the validity of the AFSAS
database and subsequent trend analysis. If any portion of the report, particularly the narrative,
findings, causes, recommendations, OPR/OCR assignments and Tab T, do not meet requirements
in this AFI and AFMAN 91-22X, the CA safety office will work with the SIB/SIO to return and
revise the report.
6.5. Briefing Investigation Results. For on-duty Class A, B, and other investigations requiring
a formal report, the CA briefing should be delivered not later than 15 days after completing the
investigation.
6.5. (AFGSC)Briefing Investigation Results. The SIB will conduct a pre-briefing for Class A
mishaps to AFGSC/SE NLT five business days prior to the convening authority briefing. The
purpose of this pre-briefing is for quality control purposes only. In addition, the SIB will ensure
an electronic copy of the final TAB T, TAB Y1 and the final message arrive at HQ AFGSC/SE
NLT two business days before the briefing to the convening authority.
   6.5.1. Board independence is critical to the integrity of the SIB process. Historically, SIB
   independence is a Congressional interest item, periodically reviewed by the Government
   Accountability Office and DoD/Inspector General. The CA will dictate and control briefing
   attendance, including any audio or video-teleconference (VTC) participation. Regardless of
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                         79


  assignment of CA, any MAJCOM owning assets (personnel or property) involved in that
  mishap and incurred damage or loss should be invited to the CA outbrief. Prior to this
  briefing, the MAJCOM/NAF Chief of Safety will ensure attendance is limited and will brief
  the CA on rules set forth in paragraphs 3.7., 6.5., and 6.6. No pre-briefing or informational
  slides will be distributed prior to the CA out-brief. However, a read-ahead copy of the
  briefing may be forwarded directly to the CA provided this copy is not coordinated or shared
  with staff members outside the safety staff. Extending attendance to those outside the
  mishap prevention chain is prohibited. Personnel identified in paragraph 3.7.2.5. will not
  attend the briefing.
     6.5.1.1. When the briefing is accomplished via VTC the MAJCOM/NAF Chief of Safety
     will ensure security of the privileged information by:
     6.5.1.2. Arranging for an appropriate safety professional to be present at each VTC
     location to ensure attendance is limited to those directed by the CA.
     6.5.1.3. Ensuring all attendees have been properly briefed on the limited-use nature of
     the information being provided and responsibilities and obligations of those personnel
     who receive privileged safety information.
  6.5.2. When the MAJCOM is the CA and with MAJCOM/CC approval, the SIB may brief
  the NAF/CC (or equivalent such as the USAF Warfare Center Commander) and the affected
  COMAFFOR for a contingency mishap, for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, prior
  to briefing the MAJCOM/CC. All other investigation outbriefs or disclosures of the report
  content to the affected squadron, group, or wing are prohibited and cannot be waived by the
  MAJCOM/CC. Prior to this briefing, the NAF Chief of Safety will brief the NAF/CC on
  rules set forth in paragraph 6.5. of this instruction. Under no circumstances will JA
  personnel be allowed to participate in the NAF informational briefing. Briefing slide
  templates are available through the CA SE or via the AFSEC SIB SUPPORT page on the AF
  portal (also see AFSAS Pubs & Refs tab).
     6.5.2.1. The NAF/CC (and COMAFFOR) and those invited per this instruction to the
     informational briefing will not direct changes to the SIB report or direct further
     investigation. The briefing must be free from the appearance of undue command
     influence that advice and directions can sometimes create.
     6.5.2.2. Except as noted below, the only personnel authorized to attend the informational
     NAF/CC briefing are the NAF/CC, NAF/CV, and with NAF/CC concurrence, the
     NAF/SE and the mishap Wing Commander. In the case of an ANG mishap, in addition
     to the above authorized attendees, the Director of the Air National Guard, and the mishap
     unit’s state Adjutant General may attend. For COMAFFOR information briefings,
     authorized attendees are the COMAFFOR, and with COMAFFOR concurrence, the
     AFFOR/SE, and the mishap air expeditionary wing commander.
     6.5.2.3. In instances where the CA has been delegated, there will be no intermediate or
     informational briefings prior to briefing the CA.
  6.5.3. Safety investigation briefings will be afforded the same protection given the formal
  report.
 80                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


   6.5.4. (Added-AFGSC) For Class A mishap briefings, all primary SIB members will attend
   the briefing to AFGSC/CC unless waived by AFGSC/SE. The SIB president will advise
   AFGSC/CC if minority positions exist upon completion of the briefing. Single projection
   electronic PowerPoint® presentations are required. Boards may use videos and exhibits to
   supplement the PowerPoint® briefing.
6.6. Convening Authority Actions. The CA has two options after receiving the results of a
safety investigation:
   6.6.1. Option 1. Accept the investigation as reported, publish the formal report (i.e. if a
   formal report was required, upload tabs to AFSAS) and release the final message. At this
   time, any causal letter notifications should be uploaded into Tab V. Do not staff the final
   message or formal report before release. It is important the SIB results remain free from any
   appearance of influence.
   6.6.2. Option 2. Direct the SIB president and its members to conduct additional safety
   investigation. The CA will provide additional guidance to the SIB to ensure the investigation
   fulfills the purpose, intent, and requirements of the Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.
       6.6.2.1. After the SIB re-examines the areas identified by the CA and completes their
       reinvestigation, the CA will have the same two options outlined above. Once this
       sequence is completed, the CA will release the final message. Do not delay release of the
       final message or formal report for internal command staffing or final costing/injury
       determination. DO NOT release the final message before completion (uploaded tabs) of
       the formal report, unless the formal report is waived.
   6.6.3. The investigation is considered complete when the final message, formal report (if
   required), and briefing to the CA (if required) are accomplished and the final message is
   released in AFSAS and subsequently accepted by the AFSEC administrator after a quality
   control review.
6.7. Notifying Person(s) Found Causal in Formal Reports. When a formal report mentions a
USAF individual (military member or civilian employee) as causal in the findings, that
individual (i.e., causal individual) will be given an opportunity to submit a statement
commenting on the findings (see paragraph 7.4.1. for causal individual procedures identified
during the MOFE). This statement is in addition to any other witness statements or testimony
provided by the individual. Both the notification and rebuttal statement are considered
privileged safety information and will be handled and protected IAW this instruction.
Notification letters will include non-disclosure agreements. Use the guidelines below to notify
causal individuals and forward their comments:
   6.7.1. The SIB president/SIO will provide the CA safety office with the notification
   memorandum for individuals found causal in their investigation. Once the CA accepts the
   formal report and releases the final message, the CA will send a copy of the memorandum to
   the mishap unit safety office. Individuals must not be notified until after the SIB outbriefs
   the CA and the final message is released. The mishap unit (wing or equivalent) Chief of
   Safety will notify the causal individual(s) and respective leadership. Use the memorandum
   on the AF Safety Portal page or in AFSAS, Pubs & Refs tab to notify the causal
   individual(s).
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                        81


  6.7.2. The causal individual(s) may use only the final message to make additional comments.
  The individual(s) will not be allowed access to the formal report (i.e. tabs in AFSAS). The
  individual(s) may not remove the final message from the safety office nor copy portions of
  any of the safety reports pertaining to the mishap naming that individual causal.
  6.7.3. The individual(s) has 15 calendar days to submit the statement to the AFSEC/SEFO
  mailbox. The individual(s) must submit a statement, though the statement may simply
  acknowledge the opportunity to comment and decline to do so.
  6.7.4. If the causal individual(s) is attached or assigned to another MAJCOM, the CA SE
  sends a copy of the completed memorandum to that MAJCOM/SE for action IAW para 6.7.1.
  Additionally, follow guidance in paragraphs 6.7.2. and 6.7.3. for notification process,
  timeline, and routing.
  6.7.5. Notifying Non-Air Force Military Personnel and Civilians Outside Air Force
  Jurisdiction. Non-Air Force personnel are not offered the opportunity to review Air Force
  safety investigation messages or formal reports, nor to submit witness statements in these
  cases. This includes Air Force personnel serving outside the Air Force, such as with the
  Defense Logistics Agency or NATO. Exception: Those Non-Air Force personnel assigned
  to fly Air Force aircraft and afforded safety privilege IAW paragraph 3.4. are authorized to
  submit a witness statement as long as they still meet the previously mentioned criteria.
 82                                              AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


                                           Chapter 7

                                   FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS

7.1. General Information. Follow-up actions conducted by reviewing authorities, convening
authorities, and AFSEC are required to ensure program compliance, hazard mitigation, and
trending validity. These three areas are core safety functions required at every level. Convening
authority safety staffs will review messages and formal reports prior to release in AFSAS for
AFI compliance, completeness, and accuracy. Although SIB/SIOs retain authority for all
substantive report changes, the report must be compliant with this AFI and AFMAN 91-22X
series manuals or be returned for corrections. Return criteria include logic trails to ensure that
actionable recommendations are supported by findings justified by sound factor analysis. Safety
offices will use AFSAS to monitor the status of open mishaps, recommendations, mishaps
requiring comments for the MOFE, and in preparation for mishap review panels (MRPs)
presented to MAJCOM commanders. The MOFE is the Air Force’s independent final evaluation
and position on causes, findings, and recommendations. The MOFE message is a distinct and
separate message from the SIB’s final message and released via AFSAS. The SIB/SIO’s final
message remains in AFSAS unaltered regardless of the final evaluation. AFSEC will normally
publish a MOFE on all on-duty Class A and select B safety reports within 90 days after release
and acceptance of the final or final supplemental message.
   7.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC Formal Report Review Process. HQ AFGSC/SE will
   send TAB T and TAB Y1 to the appropriate staff agencies upon completion of the formal
   outbrief. The normal “bottom line” suspense for each agency to evaluate and provide
   comments is five working days following the briefing. Providing comment at this time does
   not preclude agencies from commenting further upon receipt of the Air Force Safety Center’s
   request for comments and endorsements.
       7.1.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) NAF/SEFs, NAF/SEGs and NAF/SEWs will review final
       messages regarding Class C, D mishaps and Class E events at a frequency determined by
       the NAF/SE. AFGSC/SE mishap report reviews and quality checks will include review
       of human factors content and coding and will be accomplished per Attachment 11.
       Human factors will be investigated and reported in mishap reports according to AFGSC
       Human Factors Guide located on the AFGSC SharePoint® site.
7.2. AFSEC Review. In order to maintain SIB/SIO independence, AFSEC conducts a quality
review following final message release to ensure AFI/AFMAN compliance. Non-compliance
items (e.g. unsupported conclusions, incomplete investigation, tab content/format) will be
addressed by the SIB through the CA. The AFSEC review process will be accomplished within
10 business days of the final message release. This urgency is required to ensure SIB members
are still available for corrections and or clarifications IAW this AFI. The CA will ensure the SIB
addresses the results of the AFSEC review within 15 business days after AFSAS notification.
   7.2.1. The Tab T explains how the SIB determined the factors, findings, and
   recommendations of the investigation. The factors should be supported by the narrative, the
   findings should be supported by the factors, and the recommendations should be supported
   by the findings. A simple test for the Tab T is: recommendations are derived from findings,
   findings are derived from factors, and factors are supported in the narrative. AFSEC will
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                             83


   also review and compare the Tab T, narrative, and HFACS nanocodes to ensure concurrence
   of human factors/causal factors between each source.
7.3. MOFE Comment Messages. Follow-up review actions start when the final message (or
final supplemental message) is released and continue until the recommendations are acted upon
and closed. All comments for the MOFE should be accomplished using AFSAS (See
Attachment 5).
   7.3.1. The following individuals/organizations will review Class A and B final
   messages/formal reports and input their comments, if applicable, into AFSAS within 45
   calendar days after each final or final supplemental message release by the CA. If no
   comments are received, AFSEC will assume those eligible to comment concur with the
   results of the investigation. The CA staff should provide comments even if “concur as
   written” is the only applicable evaluation.
       7.3.1.1. CA.
       7.3.1.2. Lead command of weapons system (AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation
       and Responsibilities for Weapons Systems).
       7.3.1.3. Air component commanders of unified commands when the mishap occurred
       during contingency operations. Note: The unified command staff offices must agree to
       safeguard the information according to rules contained in this instruction.
       7.3.1.4. AFRC or ANG for all mishaps that involve their personnel, property, or
       equipment.
       7.3.1.5. Designated action agencies (OPR/OCRs).
       7.3.1.6. Commander of the mishap wing.
       7.3.1.7. Individual(s) found causal in the formal report may review the final message.
       7.3.1.8. Air Force agencies outside the investigating command if their functions were
       involved in the mishap (i.e. HQ AFFSA/A3A for air traffic services and airfield
       management, DCMA for mishaps involving contracts managed by DCMA).
       7.3.1.9. Unsolicited comments. Agencies and organizations reviewing the final message
       report may comment on the findings, human factors, and recommendations even though
       they are neither in the chain of command nor a designated action agency.
   7.3.2. If during the review process the CA, or higher authority, learns facts that were not
   available to safety investigators or that shed new light on the published findings, causes, and
   recommendations, he or she may do one of the following:
       7.3.2.1. Reopen the safety investigation.
       7.3.2.2. Include the new facts as a Comments for MOFE message submitted by SE staffs
       via AFSAS by selecting the “Provide Comments for MOFE” link on the mishap of
       interest. The comment period is open for 45 calendar days following the release of the
       final message or final supplemental message.
   7.3.3. Comments received after the 45 calendar day deadline cannot be input into AFSAS
   and may not be considered in the MOFE process. Request waivers through the appropriate
   AFSEC division or discipline (e.g. SEFO, SEGR).
 84                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


       7.3.3.1. The MOFE comments will only address findings, human factors, and
       recommendations.
       7.3.3.2. Provide comments about findings to address procedural errors (see Chapter 5),
       changes to causal/not causal, additions/deletions, or to add information not available to
       the SIB. Provide specific information to support the requested changes.
       7.3.3.3. Provide comments about recommendations to address procedural errors (see
       Chapter 5), changes to OPR/OCRs, or to make additions/deletions. Additionally,
       comments may address the recommendation narrative to clarify intent or correct errors.
       If the actions directed in the recommendation have already been accomplished, provide
       actions taken (paragraph 7.5.4.), and the MOFE team will close the recommendation
       during the MOFE process. Provide specific information to support the requested
       changes.
7.4. MOFE Message. The MOFE is AF/SE’s independent evaluation of the SIB’s report. This
is AF/SE’s direct communication to the CSAF on what happened in the mishap. It is published
in AFSAS with other messages related to the mishap and does not replace the SIB’s final
message or final supplemental message. The SIB’s final message (or final supplemental
message) and all tabs remain available in AFSAS as part of the official record.
   7.4.1. If the MOFE adds a person to a causal finding or significantly changes an individual’s
   role in the findings, the AFSEC division’s process owner (i.e. SEFO for Aviation and SEGR
   for Ground) will prepare a causal letter for the respective division chief’s signature. The
   division’s process owner will notify the CA safety office, who in turn will notify the mishap
   unit (wing or equivalent) Chief of Safety and must provide the individual an opportunity to
   submit comments, following the procedures in paragraphs 6.6. through 6.7. If the individuals
   are outside the CA’s command, follow procedures in paragraph 6.7.5. In addition to these
   procedures, a draft MOFE will also be provided solely for the individual to review (not for
   further comments by reviewing authorities). The MOFE will not be released by AFSEC until
   after the individual has had an opportunity to respond (usually 15 calendar days) but no later
   than 30 calendar days after the MAJCOM has been notified unless a delay is requested.
   7.4.2. AF/SE is the releasing authority of the MOFE. AFSEC will release the MOFE via
   AFSAS. When transmitted, the MOFE becomes the official Air Force position on findings,
   causes, and recommendations.
   7.4.3. A MOFE is not prepared for engine-confined FOD mishaps unless a formal report is
   required and/or significant human factors or procedural errors are involved.
7.5. Managing Recommendations.
   7.5.1. Release of the final message is an official tasking for agencies identified as OPRs and
   OCRs for corrective actions. Safety offices will use AFSAS to effectively manage updates
   and final disposition of recommendations and ORSs resulting from mishaps and events. For
   those mishaps that are selected for MOFE, provide comments/justification for adding,
   modifying, or deleting appropriate recommendations during the 45 calendar day comment
   period.
       7.5.1.1. The lead MAJCOM/A3 will brief and advocate SIB recommendations at the
       flight manual and technical order review boards. For Aviation Class A and B mishaps, if
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                         85


      recommended changes are disapproved by the flight manual or technical order review
      boards, the appropriate directorate will brief MAJCOM/CV on disapproval rationale at
      the mishap review panel (MRP) and the MAJCOM/CC or CV will accept the risk of not
      implementing the safety recommendation. However, the MAJCOM/CC or CV may
      direct the implementation of a safety recommendation regardless of the flight manual or
      technical order review board’s decision.
   7.5.2. The OPR must provide recommendation updates in AFSAS every six months until
   closed. Note: Some recommendation OPR(s), especially at or below the wing level, do not
   have AFSAS accounts to provide semi-annual updates or closure requests. In these cases, it
   is the responsibility of the accountable wing/NAF/MAJCOM SE to ensure these actions are
   taken. Elements of an acceptable recommendation update include:
      7.5.2.1. Actions planned or taken.
      7.5.2.2. Results of development or testing.
      7.5.2.3. Significant problems encountered.
      7.5.2.4. Delays experienced.
      7.5.2.5. Rationale and any supporting risk analysis to justify decisions made.
      7.5.2.6. Concurrence and non-concurrence by other agencies.
      7.5.2.7. Percentage of aircraft, equipment, etc., modified.
   7.5.3. To request closure of a recommendation the following must be accomplished:
      7.5.3.1. The OPR must request closure from the approval authority who determines if the
      closing action is acceptable. To determine closure approval authority for primary
      recommendations and other recommendations of significance, use Tables 7.1. and 7.2.
      For on-duty Class A and B recommendations, AFSEC is the approval authority for
      closure of primary recommendations.
      7.5.3.2. For Class A and B mishap recommendations, if the action taken is different from
      the proposed actions of the recommendation, the OPR’s MAJCOM CC/CV (or Materiel
      Safety Task Group Chair/System Safety Group Chair/Center Commander in AFMC)
      must approve the request for closure. For Class C and D mishaps, and Class E events, if
      action taken is different from the proposed actions of the recommendation, the OPR’s
      commander (or 2-letter director for recommendations at MAJCOM/NAF level) must
      approve the closing action. Example: If the OPR for a Class C recommendation is the
      MAJCOM/A4M and they choose an alternate method of mitigating the hazard, the
      MAJCOM/A4 must approve the closing action. If the OPR is in the Maintenance Group,
      the Wing/CC must approve the closing action.

   7.5.4. The following examples are acceptable closing actions with proper annotation:
                           7.5.4.1. Recommended changes to all applicable publications were issued/fielded.
                           Corrective action annotations must include, as a minimum, the name and/or designation
                           of the publication changed (i.e. 1B-2A-1), the date of the publication, and the affected
                           page numbers. Note: The AFSAS “Attach File” function may be used to upload files if
                           needed for clarity to further justify recommendation closure.
                           7.5.4.2. Recommended modifications to all applicable systems or items were completed.
                           Since effective mishap prevention requires identifying and tracking existing hazards,
                           recommendation closure should not be requested for open TCTO actions until the TCTO
                           is complete. In most cases, the design change must have been implemented on all
                           affected systems to warrant closure.
                           7.5.4.3. Recommended studies or evaluations were completed, conclusions were
                           validated, and actions on all validated requirements were completed. In these cases, the
                           OPR shall include detailed rationale, to include a risk analysis, to support their
                           conclusions.
                           7.5.4.4. Recommended changes to training were completed. If the training changes were
                           captured in a publication, see paragraph 7.5.4.1. Otherwise, corrective action annotations
                           must include, as a minimum, the implementation method of the new training, the date
                           implemented, and the currency requirement for the training.
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                         87


     7.5.4.5. For recommendations closed without action taken, risk acceptance is required
     (see paragraph 7.5.4.5.1.). Document the risk analysis and acceptance at the appropriate
     level in AFSAS. For example, “In lieu of a software update, the MAJCOM/CV accepted
     the risk associated with not implementing this recommendation during the MRP on 13
     Oct XX. See attached risk analysis under “attached files” for supporting details.”
         7.5.4.5.1. For Class A and B mishap recommendations, risk acceptance is normally
         obtained through the MRP staffing process. If the lead MAJCOM is not the OPR, the
         current OPR will coordinate and reassign the recommendation to the lead MAJCOM
         with an appropriate risk analysis and recommendation to allow the lead
         MAJCOM/SE office to brief the commander and gain risk acceptance.
     7.5.4.6. If the recommendation is not implemented due to a completed programmed
     removal/retirement of the system or item from service, then the completion date of the
     removal/retirement must be annotated. If the system is not completely removed from
     service at the time of the closure request then a risk analysis and risk acceptance
     statement is required.
  7.5.5. Other safety offices are afforded the opportunity in AFSAS to coordinate on a
  recommendation's closing action. Coordination must occur within 30 calendar days of the
  OPR requesting closure.
  7.5.6. The approval authority will approve closure only after all actions have been completed
  and properly annotated.
  7.5.7. Each MAJCOM/DRU/FOA/NGB will establish a MRP. MRPs will include all open
  Class A and B recommendations assigned to an OPR within the specific command, not just at
  the command level. The purpose of an MRP is to address Class A and B hazards throughout
  the command regardless of the organizational level of the OPR. AFSAS can be used by
  MAJCOM safety offices to find these open recommendations by including “subordinate
  units” in the recommendation search criteria data fields.
     7.5.7.1. The MRP will meet no less than once every six months. All recommendation
     updates approved at the MRP will be input into AFSAS within 30 calendar days.
     7.5.7.2. At a minimum, the MAJCOM/SE will provide the CC or CV the following
     information through the MRP process:
         7.5.7.2.1. All open Class A and B recommendations to include latest status updates
         and changes since previous MRP report to AFSEC. The MRP should also include
         recommendations from mishaps that have not yet been through the MOFE process.
         7.5.7.2.2. A risk analysis for recommendations requiring a risk acceptance.
         7.5.7.2.3. Identify recommendations open over two years with rationale.
         7.5.7.2.4. Closure actions since the last MRP report to AFSEC.
         7.5.7.2.5. Summary of recommendations closed without action per MDS where risk
         was accepted.
     7.5.7.3. MAJCOMs will forward a memorandum signed by the MAJCOM SE to the
     AFSEC on 15 April and 15 October every year. Regardless of the dates of the MRPs, the
88                                          AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


     report to AFSEC will cover the first and second half of the fiscal year, respectively.
     There is no requirement to send the actual MRP briefing. The memorandum will contain:
        7.5.7.3.1. Number of recommendations closed since last MRP report to AFSEC.
        7.5.7.3.2. Number of open recommendations.
        7.5.7.3.3. Number of recommendations open for longer than two years.
        7.5.7.3.4. Number of recommendations closed with accepted risk per MDS.
     7.5.7.4. AFMC is exempt from conducting an MRP at the MAJCOM level. Centers
     under AFMC shall provide results to AFMC/SE not later than 1 April and 1 October
     every year. AFMC/SE will comply with paragraph 7.5.7.3.

Terms
Aero Club Aircraft—These are all aircraft assigned to the respective Aero Club. The Aero
Club through purchase, lease, or loan from the government may have acquired these aircraft.
Aero Clubs are authorized excess DoD and General Service Administration (GSA) aircraft on a
loan basis.
Aerospace Vehicles—DoD aircraft, RPA/UASs, missiles, and space vehicles.
Afloat Mishap—An Air Force mishap occurring on board or resulting from or during the
operation of a DoD vessel, including mishaps during DoD diving or swimmer operations;
mishaps occurring while loading, off-loading, or receiving services at dockside; and mishaps
occurring up to the high water mark during amphibious or inshore warfare training operations. It
applies to all injuries to DoD personnel occurring on board, whether or not job related. A mishap
occurring on board that results from shipyard, repair facility, or private contractor operations is a
ground (industrial) mishap, not an afloat mishap.
Afloat Combat Support And Training Mishap—An afloat mishap associated with a non-
combat military exercise or training activity designed to develop a military member's physical
ability, maintain or increase individual or collective combat and peacekeeping skills, and is due
to either a mishap or the result of natural causes when the medical event occurs during or within
1 hour after any training activity where the exercise or activity could be a contributing factor.
This includes all training activities that do not meet the definition or are not included as values in
sports, recreation, and individual fitness.
Afloat Industrial And Occupational Mishap—An afloat mishap occurring on a vessel
involving operations similar to those performed in private industry (such as boiler maintenance).
Includes, but is not limited to, equipment maintenance, facility construction and maintenance,
health care provision, laboratory research, and administrative and clerical tasks. A mishap that
occurs on board that results from shipyard, repair facility, or private contractor operations are
ground (industrial) mishaps.
Afloat Miscellaneous Mishap—An afloat mishap not assigned to another subcategory.
Afloat Sports, Recreation, And Individual Fitness Mishap—An afloat mishap associated with
an activity that:
 98                                               AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


• Requires physical exertion and skill that is governed by a set of rules or customs and often
undertaken competitively.
• Refreshes one’s mind or body through activity that amuses or stimulates.
Involves the activity of exerting muscles in various ways to keep fit through the
performance of exercise. This includes all fitness activities that do not meet the criteria for
command—directed or organized fitness programs.
Aviation Flight Mishap—Any mishap in which there is intent for flight and reportable damage
to a DoD aircraft. Explosives and chemical agents or guided missile mishaps that cause damage
in excess of $20,000 to a DoD aircraft with intent for flight are categorized as aircraft flight
mishaps to avoid dual reporting. This is the only aviation mishap subcategory that contributes to
the flight mishap rate.
Aviation Flight—Related Mishap—Any mishap in which there is intent for flight and no
reportable damage to the DoD aircraft itself, but the mishap involves a fatality, reportable injury,
or reportable property damage. A missile or RPA/UAS that is launched from a DoD aircraft,
departs without damaging the aircraft, and is subsequently involved in a DoD mishap is
reportable as a guided missile mishap or RPA/UAS, respectively.
Aviation Ground Operations Mishap—Aviation Ground Operations are mishaps that involve
DoD aircraft with no intent for flight that result in reportable damage to DoD aircraft, injury, or
fatality. Damage to an aircraft when it is being handled as a commodity or cargo is not
reportable as an aircraft mishap.
Air Force At Large—Used for recording losses. Mishaps involving exchange students, military
members in a non-pay status while waiting for appellate review if they have no written or verbal
orders to return to an Air Force installation, prior service personnel on leave before reporting to

insecticides, and industrial chemicals, unless selected by the DoD Components for chemical
warfare purposes, are also excluded.
Chemical Agent Mishap—Any unintentional or uncontrolled release of a chemical agent when:
reportable damage to property results from contamination or costs are incurred for
decontamination; or individuals exhibit physiological symptoms of agent exposure; or the agent
quantity released to the atmosphere is such that a serious potential for exposure is created by
exceeding the applicable maximum allowable concentration-time levels for exposure of
unprotected workers or the general population or property.
Class A Mishap—The resulting total cost of damages to Government and other property is $2
million or more, a DoD aircraft is destroyed (excluding UAS Groups 1, 2, or 3), or an injury or
occupational illness results in a fatality or permanent total disability.
Class B Mishap—The resulting total cost of damages to Government and other property is
$500,000 or more, but less than $2 million. An injury or occupational illness results in permanent
partial disability, or when three or more personnel are hospitalized for inpatient care (which, for
mishap reporting purposes only, does not include just observation or diagnostic care) as a result
of a single mishap.
Class C Mishap—The resulting total cost of property damages to Government and other
property is $50,000 or more, but less than $500,000; or a nonfatal injury or illness that results in

Controlled Movement Area (Cma)—As defined in Airfield Operation Instructions, any portion
of the airfield requiring aircraft (including RPA/UAS), vehicles and pedestrians to obtain
specific Air Traffic Control approval for access (normally via two-way radio contact with the
control tower). Controlled Movement Areas include but are not limited to areas used for takeoff,
landing and as required taxiing of aircraft. Note: This definition is used in lieu of "movement
area" as defined in the FAA Pilot Controller Glossary, also called CMA.
Convening Authority (Ca)—The individual who has the authority to order a safety
investigation.
Critical Profile—A mission profile exceeding system limitations based on system specifications
or other program documentation.
Days Away From Work—Those days when a person loses 1 or more work days as a result of

including calendar days the person was unable to work, regardless of whether the person was
scheduled to work on those days. (See section 1904.7(b)(3) of Reference (h).) For military
personnel, days away from work for on- and off-duty injuries and occupational illnesses include
inpatient hospitalization, medical restrictions to quarters, and convalescent leave.
Days Of Restricted Work Or Transfer To Another Job—Days on which a person is working
but restricted from completing assigned tasks, works less than a full day or shift, or is transferred
to another task to accommodate the injury or illness. Calendar days not scheduled to work are
included in the count of days. Count of days is stopped when the person is either returned to their

status technicians, and non-appropriated fund employees. To avoid dual reporting this excludes
military personnel working part-time; Corps of Engineers Civil Works employees; Youth or
Student Assistance Program employees; foreign nationals employed by the DoD Components;
and Army-Air Force Exchange Service employees. Foreign national employees fall into two
categories: 1) Direct Hire – Under the direct hire system, the U.S. Forces are the legal employer
of the foreign national and assumes responsibility for all administrative and management
functions with foreign national employment; 2) Indirect Hire – The host government serves as
the legal employer of U. S. Forces’ foreign nationals. Although the host government is the
official employer for the foreign national personnel, it grants operational control to the U. S.
Forces for the day-to-day management of such personnel. See DoD 1400.25-M, Sub-Chapter
1231 for additional information.

members of other US military services serving on extended active duty with the Air Force or
foreign-national military personnel assigned to the Air Force.
Destroyed Aircraft/Rpa/Uas—A damaged aircraft/RPA/UAS not repaired is not automatically
a "destroyed" aircraft/RPA/UAS. The decision not to return a damaged aircraft/RPA/UAS to
service is independent of the mishap class. When the aircraft/RPA/UAS will not be returned to
service, classify the mishap damage according to the total estimated repair cost as if it had been
returned to service. Detailed procedures for obtaining disposition recommendations from the
program manager can be found in AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment,
Distribution, Accounting, and Termination.

machinery and any thrust augmentation systems. The term “engine” does not include reduction
gearboxes, propellers or propeller control devices.
Engine—Confined—Applies when an aircraft or RPA/UAS turbine engine experiences
reportable damage (Class C or higher) that is confined to the engine and integral engine
components. Damage is considered confined to the engine if there is less than Class C damage
external to the engine. If the total cost of all damage external to the engine is equal to or greater
than the Class C damage cost threshold, then the mishap is not engine-confined, regardless of the
comparative extent of engine damage cost.
Engine—Confined Fod Mishap—A mishap in which an aircraft or RPA/UAS turbine engine
experiences reportable foreign object damage (Class C or higher) that is confined to the engine
and integral engine components. Damage is considered FOD if it is caused by inanimate objects
external to the engine (i.e. rocks, tools, safety wire, ice, etc.). Damage is considered confined to
the engine if there is less than Class C damage external to the engine. If the total cost of all
damage external to the engine is equal to or greater than the Class C damage cost threshold, then
the mishap is not engine-confined, regardless of the comparative extent of engine damage cost.

barbershops, places of worship, cleaning establishments, bowling centers, officer and
enlisted clubs, gymnasiums, and similar on—base non-appropriated fund (NAF) facilities and
similar places required for the health or comfort of the member, are considered on-duty.
However, when personnel deviate from the normal incidents of the trip and become involved in
activities, personal or otherwise, that are not reasonably incidental to the duties of the temporary
assignment contemplated by the employer, the person ceases to be considered on-duty for
investigation and reporting purposes of injuries or occupational illnesses. Injuries or
occupational illnesses to personnel resulting from activities unrelated to the temporary duty
assignment or non-commander directed sports and recreation activities (e.g. jogging, golfing,
basketball) will be reported as off-duty mishaps.
Taking part in compulsory physical fitness training, sporting events, and physical fitness
evaluation activities (including cycle ergometric testing when permitted). On—duty
compulsory fitness training and activities include directed sports activities at professional

      (SIB President)
SUBJECT: Protection of USAF Privileged Safety Information

1. In response to my request for technical assistance, the Air Force and your employer have
agreed that you will serve as a technical expert for the Safety Investigation Board (SIB) over
which I preside. Unless you specifically identify information in any technical report you provide
to the SIB as proprietary data or confidential analysis or opinion, it will be included in the
releasable portion (Part 1) of the SIB’s final report. If you want us to treat any part of your report
as privileged information so we can protect it from disclosure outside the Department of
Defense, you must specifically request such protection. In such case it will be included in the
privileged portion (Part 2) of the formal safety report and will be used solely for mishap-
prevention purposes.

2. The military safety privilege protects information provided under a promise of confidentiality
and the deliberative process of the SIB. It enhances the SIB’s ability to identify potential causes
of mishaps quickly and accurately so we can prevent their recurrence. This process must have the
highest degree of reliability to maintain combat readiness, national security, and public safety.

3. In accepting your appointment to serve as technical expert, you must also agree to safeguard
our safety privilege. You may be given access to privileged information and you must not
disclose to anyone, including your employer, any privileged information derived from our
investigation. You will prepare only one copy of your technical report for the SIB. You will
destroy or surrender to me any notes, documents, computer files, or other materials, produced or
obtained during this investigation, if they contain privileged information. You must not make
copies of any privileged documents (including analytical computer products, confidential tape
recordings, and staged photographs) for use outside the proceedings of this board. You may not
have a copy of Part 2 of the Board’s final report or any part of a draft thereof. You must report to
me (or, after the SIB is dissolved, to HQ Air Force Safety Center) any attempt by anyone, other

                    EXAMPLE OF TECHNICAL EXPERT REPORTS

NON-PRIVILEGED REPORT

Mishap System: Equipment and serial number
Mishap Date:
Investigator: Name, organizational address, and phone numbers.
INTRODUCTION: Factual Report of (state the intent of the report or analysis; purpose).
BACKGROUND: Not always required. If used, a statement of the mishap scenario, limited to
facts.

OBSERVATIONS: Investigator observations of physical evidence, other factual data, and
statements made without a promise of confidentiality.

ANALYSIS: Investigator evaluation of physical evidence, other factual data and statements
made without a promise of confidentiality. Describe strong and weak points of analysis if
appropriate.

CONCLUSIONS: Investigator conclusions and opinions based on analysis of physical evidence,
other factual data and statements made without a promise of confidentiality. Do not include any
opinion as to whether a particular failure contributed to or caused the mishap. This does not
preclude stating an opinion that a failure would likely create a certain condition, even if the
mishap was inevitable under such a condition. For example, an opinion could be expressed that
a widget failure would have caused trim to move to the full nose up position, without making the
connecting statement that such a trim position would inevitably cause a crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Investigator recommendations, to include recommendations to
prevent the mishap, related to the investigator’s area of expertise.

Example 1

OBSERVATIONS: Three of the four right wing leading edge flap (LEF) actuators were
recovered intact but separated from the wing. Measurement of each actuator’s angular position
revealed the following: 19.2 degrees down, 20.3 degrees down, and 19.8 degrees down.

ANALYSIS: The right wing LEF actuator positions correlated well with the expected LEF
position of 19.6 degrees down based on the Mach, altitude, and AOA recorded by the CSFDR
system just prior to impact.

CONCLUSION: The LEF on the right wing was properly positioned.

Example 2

OBSERVATIONS: The radome was found separated from the fuselage with relatively minor
impact damage. The right AOA probe was bent; however, the slots appeared to be rotated up
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                           133


farther than normal, even taking into account impact damage. The left AOA probe sustained
only minor damage and rotated freely. The left probe mid-range positioning differed
significantly from what is expected of a correctly aligned probe. The pitot probe was not
recovered.

ANALYSIS: The left and right AOA transmitters were removed to determine the actual mid-
range (boresight) angle. The right AOA transmitter mid-range angle, as determined by
alignment ring location, was 25.5° up; this is approximately 45° higher than the required mid-
range value of 20° down. The right AOA alignment ring was incorrectly positioned. Removal
of the left transmitter revealed it was also improperly installed. Only one of the two dowel pins
was seated into the alignment ring. In addition, the left AOA alignment ring was also incorrectly
positioned. The mid-travel angle of the left probe, as boresighted, was determined to be
approximately 117° down, producing a positioning error of 97° down. The alignment and
installation errors combined to produce a mid-travel range of approximately 55° up or a total
position error of 75°.

CONCLUSIONS: Both AOA transmitters were incorrectly installed. The position of the right
AOA transmitter would cause an erroneously large AOA signal to be supplied to the flight
control computer. The position of the left AOA transmitter would also cause an erroneously
large AOA signal to be supplied to the flight control computer. Since a mid-value AOA
selection process is used by the flight control computer, an erroneously large AOA signal was
used by the flight control computer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Sample Recommendation 1: Redesign AOA transmitters, incorporating design features, to
ensure proper installation orientation.
Sample Recommendation 2: Update flight control computer logic to detect abnormal AOA
inputs during system initialization during ground operations and issue appropriate maintenance
faults and cockpit warnings.


PRIVILEGED REPORT

Mishap System: Equipment and serial number
Mishap Date:
Investigator: Name, organizational address, and phone numbers.
INTRODUCTION: Part 2 Supplement to Factual Report of (state the intent of the report or
analysis; purpose, identical to the Part 1 factual report statement).
OBSERVATIONS: Not required if the Part 2 report is a supplement to a Part 1 report that
contains observations. Otherwise, investigator observations of physical evidence, other factual
or privileged data, and statements made with or without a promise of confidentiality.
ANALYSIS: Investigator evaluation of physical evidence, other data, statements made with or
without a promise of confidentiality, proprietary company data, and appointed SIB member
deliberations. Describe strong and weak points of analysis if appropriate.

CONCLUSIONS: Investigator conclusions and opinions based on analysis of physical evidence,
other data, statements made with or without a promise of confidentiality, proprietary company
data, and appointed SIB member deliberations.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Investigator recommendations, to include recommendations to
prevent the mishap, related to the investigator’s area of expertise.

           DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HUMAN FACTORS ANALYSIS AND
                  CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (DOD HFACS)

A6.1. Introduction. This information applies to all safety disciplines. Department of Defense
Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (DoD HFACS) implements portions of DoDI
6055.07, Mishap Notification, Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping. The DoDI directs
DoD components to “Establish procedures to provide for the cross-feed of human error data
using a common human error categorization system that involves human factors taxonomy
accepted among the DoD Components and U.S. Coast Guard.” All investigators who report and
analyze DoD mishaps will use DoD HFACS and insert the applicable HFACS nanocodes into
the appropriate Tabs (usually T and Y) for all Findings in the mishap sequence. Human Factors
is not just about humans. It is about how features of people’s tools, tasks and working
environment systemically influence human performance. This model is designed to present a
systematic, multidimensional approach to error analysis.
A6.2. Purpose. A thorough mishap investigation is absolutely necessary to determine the
cascading events causal to a mishap, and to recommend corrective actions to prevent recurrence.
This guide provides the mishap investigator with a template that aids in organizing the
investigation. Mishaps are rarely attributed to a single cause, or in most instances, even a single
individual. The goal of a mishap or event investigation is to identify these failures and
conditions in order to understand why the mishap occurred and how it might be prevented from
happening again. This attachment is designed for use by all members of an investigation board
in order to accurately capture the complex layers of human error in context with the individual
and mishap or event.
A6.3. Description. As described by James Reason (1990), active failures are the actions or
inactions of operators that are believed to cause the mishap. Traditionally referred to as "error,"
they are the last "acts" committed by individuals, often with immediate and tragic consequences.
For example, an aviator forgetting to lower the landing gear before touch down will yield
relatively immediate, and potentially grave, consequences. In contrast, latent failures or
conditions are errors that exist within the organization or in the chain of command that affect the
sequence of events characteristic of a mishap. For example, it is not difficult to understand how
tasking Security Forces crews or teams at the expense of quality rest can lead to fatigue and
ultimately errors (active failures). Viewed from this perspective then, the actions of individuals
are the end result of a chain of factors originating in other parts (often the upper echelons) of the
organization. These latent failures or conditions may lie dormant or undetected for some period
of time prior to their manifestation as a mishap. The question for mishap investigators is how to
identify and mitigate these active and latent failures or conditions. Reason's "Swiss Cheese"
model describes the levels at which active failures and latent failures/conditions may occur
within complex operations (see Figure A6.1.). Organizations implement controls to mitigate
hazards. Dr. Reason philosophized four layers of controls in an organization. The holes in the
layers represent failed or absent controls. Working backward from the mishap, the first level of
Reason's model depicts those Unsafe Acts of Operators (operator, maintainers, facility personnel,
etc.) that ultimately lead to a mishap. Traditionally, this is where most mishap investigations
have focused their examination of human error, and consequently where most causal factors are
uncovered. After all, it is typically the actions or inactions of individuals that can be directly
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                              137


linked to the mishap. What makes Reason's model particularly useful in mishap investigation is
it forces investigators to address latent failures and conditions within the causal sequence of
events.     Latent failures or conditions such as fatigue, complacency, illness, and the
physical/technological environment all affect individual performance, but can be overlooked by
investigators with even the best of intentions. These particular latent failures and conditions are
described within the context of Reason's model as Preconditions for Unsafe Acts. Likewise,
Supervision can promote unsafe conditions of operators and ultimately unsafe acts will occur.
For example, if an Operations Officer were to pair a below average team leader with a very
junior/inexperienced crew, the result is increased risk of mission failure. Reason's model does
not stop at supervision; it also considers Organizational Influences that can impact performance
at all levels. For instance, in times of fiscal constraints, funding may be short and may lead to
limited training opportunities. The investigation process endeavors to detect and identify the
"holes (failed or absent defenses) in the cheese" (see Figure A6.1.). Each mishap is not unique
from its predecessors. In fact, most mishaps have very similar causes. If we know what the
failures or "holes" are, we can better identify their roles in mishaps -- or better yet, detect their
presence and develop a risk mitigation strategy correcting them before a mishap occurs.

Figure A6.1. The Swiss Cheese Model.




A6.4. Application. When we analyze a mishap with this framework we get a system that can
identify the acts of the mishap individual, but acts of others (wingman, team/crew member,
dispatcher, etc.) end up being Preconditions or Supervisory/Organizational factors. This can lead
to a poor analysis of individual failures outside those of the mishap individual. When we look at
real mishaps we find the dynamic looks more like a complex web of failures/errors and
contributing failures/errors of multiple individual as well as failures in the “system.” (See Figure
A6.2.). Chain of events models encourage notions of linear causality and do not account for the
 138                                             AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


indirect, non-linear, and feedback relationships common for accidents in complex systems.
When the mishap is investigated as an interdependent system, any person whose actions or
inactions impacted the outcome of the mishap should be investigated as a mishap person. Those
individuals will have their acts and preconditions identified. The context in which these acts and
preconditions occurred will be captured in the supervisory and organizational factors. The
supervisory and organizational factors will be identified against the mishap or event and not a
specific person. Mishap factors can cross all four tiers of the model and the investigator can
apply this model by entering at any tier. DoD HFACS is based on human error causation models
in systems and will be used to investigate Weapons, Ground, Space, and Aviation mishaps.

Figure A6.2. Diagram of Complex Factors within a Mishap.




   A6.4.1. Person Level. The Acts and Preconditions Tiers are defined as the Person Level
   within the AFSAS. If a person’s actions or inactions directly impacted the outcome of the
   mishap, capture this person’s Acts and Preconditions. These are the actions or inactions of
   operators that tend to be close in time and space to the mishap occurrence. Traditionally
   referred to as "error," they are the last "acts" committed by individuals, often with immediate
   and tragic consequences. Capture the Preconditions for each individual who led to that
   person’s actions or inactions.
   A6.4.2. Mishap Level. Supervision and Organization Tiers are captured at the Mishap
   Level within AFSAS and are not coded against a specific person; they are assigned against
   the mishap or event. Actions or inactions at these tiers are conditions that exist within the
   organization or elsewhere in the supervisory chain of command that affect the mishap. For
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                            139


  example, inadequate or non-existent technical order guidance which contributes to the
  mishap sequence is captured at the mishap level.
  A6.4.3. Rating. Each human factor code identified must be rated for its influence on the
  mishap as causal, contributory or outcome.
     A6.4.3.1. Causes are deficiencies which if corrected would likely have prevented or
     mitigated damage and/or injury. Cause does not imply blame. Events/conditions that are
     highly probable results of other events/conditions are not causes. They should be rated as
     either contributors or outcomes.
     A6.4.3.2. Contributors are single events/conditions that are essential to the mishap
     sequence. They offer an independent contribution or allow the progression of other
     events/conditions. If an event/condition is both contributory and causal, rate it only as
     causal.
     A6.4.3.3. Outcomes are single events or conditions that are present during the mishap
     and are highly probable results of one or more contributors/causes. All outcomes are not
     findings – some are present but have no material effect upon the progression of the
     mishap sequence. If an outcome is also a contributor or cause, rate it only as a
     contributor or cause.
  A6.4.4. Relationships. Within the context of this model, failed or absent controls at one
  level led to failed or absent controls at another level. For example, fatigue can lead to a
  procedural error. If the investigator identifies that one code contributed to another code, then
  that relationship will be identified in AFSAS. Usually a code at a higher tier will relate to the
  code at the lower tier. For instance, in the example above, the investigator would relate
  fatigue to the procedural error. The investigator does not need to identify a relationship both
  up and down the chain for two related codes. One relationship is all that is required.
  Relationships can exist between codes in the same tier and can skip tiers. For example, a
  code at the Supervision Tier can be related to a code at the Acts tiers.
  A6.4.5. Figure A6.3. shows a graphical overview of the DoD-HFACS model, with each
  nanocode shown in its position within the hierarchy.

ACTS

Acts are those factors that are most closely tied to the mishap, and can be described as active
failures or actions committed by the operator that result in human error or unsafe situation.

Errors are factors in a mishap when mental or physical activities of the operator fail to achieve
their intended outcome as a result of skill-based, perceptual, or judgment and decision making
errors leading to an unsafe situation. Errors are unintended.

Skill-Based Errors are factors in a mishap when errors occur in the operator’s execution of a
routine, highly practiced task relating to procedure, training or proficiency and result in an unsafe
situation.

AE101 Inadvertent Operation
Inadvertent Operation is a factor when individual’s movements inadvertently activate or
deactivate equipment, controls or switches when there is no intent to operate the control or
device. This action may be noticed or unnoticed by the individual.

AE102 Checklist Error
Checklist Error is a factor when the individual, either through an act of commission or omission
makes a checklist error or fails to run an appropriate checklist and this failure results in an unsafe
situation.

AE103 Procedural Error
Procedural Error is a factor when a procedure is accomplished in the wrong sequence or using
the wrong technique or when the wrong control or switch is used. This also captures errors in
navigation, calculation or operation of automated systems.

AE104 Overcontrol/Undercontrol
Overcontrol/Undercontrol is a factor when an individual responds inappropriately to conditions
by either overcontrolling or undercontrolling the aircraft/vehicle/system. The error may be a
result of preconditions or a temporary failure of coordination.

AE105 Breakdown in Visual Scan
Breakdown in Visual Scan is a factor when the individual fails to effectively execute learned /
practiced internal or external visual scan patterns leading to unsafe situation.

AE106 Inadequate Anti-G Straining Maneuver (AGSM)
Inadequate Anti-G Straining Maneuver is a factor when the individuals AGSM is improper,
inadequate, poorly timed or non-existent and this leads to adverse neurocirculatory effects.

Judgment and Decision-Making Errors are factors in a mishap when behavior or actions of the
individual proceed as intended yet the chosen plan proves inadequate to achieve the desired end-
state and results in an unsafe situation.
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                               143


AE201 Risk Assessment – During Operation
Risk Assessment – During Operation is a factor when the individual fails to adequately evaluate
the risks associated with a particular course of action and this faulty evaluation leads to
inappropriate decision and subsequent unsafe situation. This failure occurs in real-time when
formal risk-assessment procedures are not possible.

AE202 Task Misprioritization
Task Misprioritization is a factor when the individual does not organize, based on accepted
prioritization techniques, the tasks needed to manage the immediate situation.

AE203 Necessary Action – Rushed
Necessary Action – Rushed is a factor when the individual takes the necessary action as dictated
by the situation but performs these actions too quickly and the rush in taking action leads to an
unsafe situation.

AE204 Necessary Action – Delayed
Necessary Action – Delayed is a factor when the individual selects a course of action but elects
to delay execution of the actions and the delay leads to an unsafe situation.

AE205 Caution/Warning – Ignored
Caution/Warning – Ignored is a factor when a caution or warning is perceived and understood by
the individual but is ignored by the individual leading to an unsafe situation.

AE206 Decision-Making During Operation
Decision-Making During Operation is a factor when the individual through faulty logic selects
the wrong course of action in a time-constrained environment.

Perception Errors are factors in a mishap when misperception of an object, threat or situation,
(such as visual, auditory, proprioceptive, or vestibular illusions, cognitive or attention failures,
etc), results in human error.

AE301 Error due to Misperception
Error due to Misperception is a factor when an individual acts or fails to act based on an illusion;
misperception or disorientation state and this act or failure to act creates an unsafe situation.

Violations are factors in a mishap when the actions of the operator represent willful disregard for
rules and instructions and lead to an unsafe situation. Violations are deliberate.

AV001 Violation - Based on Risk Assessment
Violation- Based on Risk Assessment is a factor when the consequences/risk of violating
published procedures was recognized, consciously assessed and honestly determined by the
individual, crew or team to be the best course of action. Routine “work-arounds” and unofficial
procedures that are accepted by the community as necessary for operations are also captured
under this code.

AV002 Violation - Routine/Widespread
 144                                               AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


Violation - Routine/Widespread is a factor when a procedure or policy violation is systemic in a
unit/setting and not based on a risk assessment for a specific situation. It needlessly commits the
individual, team, or crew to an unsafe course-of-action. These violations may have leadership
sanction and may not routinely result in disciplinary/administrative action. Habitual violations
of a single individual or small group of individuals within a unit can constitute a
routine/widespread violation if the violation was not routinely disciplined or was condoned by
supervisors. These violations may also be referred to as “Routine Violations.”

AV003 Violation - Lack of Discipline
Violation - Lack of Discipline is a factor when an individual, crew or team intentionally violates
procedures or policies without cause or need. These violations are unusual or isolated to specific
individuals rather than larger groups. There is no evidence of these violations being condoned
by leadership. These violations may also be referred to as “exceptional violations.” (Note: These
violations may also carry UCMJ consequences. Boards should consult the Judge Advocate of
the CA.)

PRECONDITIONS

Preconditions are factors in a mishap if active and/or latent preconditions such as conditions of
the operators, environmental or personnel factors affect practices, conditions or actions of
individuals and result in human error or an unsafe situation.

Environmental Factors are factors in a mishap if physical or technological factors affect
practices, conditions and actions of individual and result in human error or an unsafe situation.

Physical Environment is a factor in a mishap if environmental phenomena such as weather,
climate, white-out or brown out conditions affect the actions of individuals and result in human
error or an unsafe situation.

cause injury, prevent or interfere with the performance of normal duties. Do not use this code to
capture G-induced loss of consciousness.

PE109 Lighting of Other Aircraft/Vehicle
Lighting of Other Aircraft/Vehicle is a factor when the absence, pattern, intensity or location of
the lighting of other aircraft/vehicle prevents or interferes with safe task accomplishment.

PE110 Noise Interference
Noise Interference is a factor when any sound not directly related to information needed for task
accomplishment interferes with the individual’s ability to perform that task.

PE111 Brownout/Whiteout
Brownout/Whiteout is a factor when dust, snow, water, ash or other particulates in the
environment are disturbed by the aircraft, vehicle or person and cause a restriction of vision to a
point where normal duties are affected

Technological Environment is a factor in a mishap when cockpit/vehicle/control
station/workspace design factors or automation affect the actions of individuals and result in
human error or an unsafe situation.

the perception or performance of individuals and result in human error or an unsafe situation.

PC101 Inattention
Inattention is a factor when the individual has a state of reduced conscious attention due to a
sense of security, self-confidence, boredom or a perceived absence of threat from the
environment which degrades crew performance. (This may often be a result of highly repetitive
tasks. Lack of a state of alertness or readiness to process immediately available information.)
AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                              147



PC102 Channelized Attention
Channelized Attention is a factor when the individual is focusing all conscious attention on a
limited number of environmental cues to the exclusion of others of a subjectively equal or higher
or more immediate priority, leading to an unsafe situation. May be described as a tight focus of
attention that leads to the exclusion of comprehensive situational information.

process exceeds their cognitive or mental resources in the amount of time available to process
the information.

PC104 Confusion
Confusion is a factor when the individual is unable to maintain a cohesive and orderly awareness
of events and required actions and experiences a state characterized by bewilderment, lack of
clear thinking, or (sometimes) perceptual disorientation.

PC105 Negative Transfer
Negative Transfer is a factor when the individual reverts to a highly learned behavior used in a
previous system or situation and that response is inappropriate or degrades mission performance.

PC106 Distraction
Distraction is a factor when the individual has an interruption of attention and/or inappropriate
redirection of attention by an environmental cue or mental process that degrades performance.

PC107 Geographic Misorientation (Lost)

Personality style is a factor when the individual’s personal interaction with others creates an
unsafe situation. Examples are authoritarian, over-conservative, impulsive, invulnerable,
submissive or other personality traits that result in degraded crew performance.

PC206 Overconfidence
Overconfidence is a factor when the individual overvalues or overestimates personal capability,
the capability of others or the capability of aircraft/vehicles or equipment and this creates an
unsafe situation.

PC207 Pressing
Pressing is a factor when the individual knowingly commits to a course of action that presses
them and/or their equipment beyond reasonable limits.

PC208 Complacency
Complacency is a factor when the individual’s state of reduced conscious attention due to an
attitude of overconfidence, undermotivation or the sense that others “have the situation under
control” leads to an unsafe situation.

PC209 Inadequate Motivation
Inadequate Motivation is a factor when the individual’s motivation to accomplish a task or
mission is weak or indecisive.

PC210 Misplaced Motivation

AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014                                                               149



PC213 “Get-Home-Itis/Get-There-Itis"
“Get-Home-Itis/Get-There-Itis" is a factor when an individual or crew is motivated to complete a
mission or reach a destination for personal reasons, thereby short cutting necessary procedures or
exercising poor judgment, leading to an unsafe situation.

PC214 Response Set
Response set is a factor when the individual has a cognitive or mental framework of expectations
that predispose them to a certain course of action regardless of other cues.

PC215 Motivational Exhaustion (Burnout)
Motivational Exhaustion (Burnout) is a factor when the individual has the type of exhaustion
associated with the wearing effects of high operations and personal tempo where their
operational requirements impinge on their ability to satisfy their personal requirements and leads
to degraded cognitive or operational capability.

Adverse Physiological States are factors when an individual experiences a physiologic event
that compromises human performance and this decreases performance and results in an unsafe
situation.

PC301 Effects of G Forces (G-LOC, etc)
Effects of G Forces (G-LOC, etc) is a factor when the individual experiences G-induced loss of

Operational Injury/Illness is a factor when an injury is sustained or illness develops from the
operational environment or during the mission and this injury or illness results in an unsafe
situation. This includes toxic exposure. Details of injury, illness or toxic exposure should be
captured in the medical investigation. Do not use this code to capture injury or illness that does
not cause an unsafe situation or contribute to the mishap sequence.

unsafe situation and situations where vision deficit or loss of prosthetic devices during the
 150                                               AFI91-204_AFGSCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2014


mission cause an unsafe situation. An individual must board the aircraft or begin the
mission/task with prior knowledge of illness/injury/deficit otherwise mark and rate PC303.
Details of injury, illness or deficit should be captured in the medical investigation. Do not use
this code to capture injury or illness that does not cause an unsafe situation or contribute to the
mishap sequence (i.e., medevac patient whose condition deteriorates during flight).

PC306 Physical Fatigue (Overexertion)
Physical Fatigue (Overexertion) is a factor when the individual’s diminished physical capability
is due to overuse (time/relative load) and it degrades task performance. It includes the effects of
prolonged physical activity, or the effects of brief but relatively extreme physical activity, either
of which taxes a person’s physical endurance or strength beyond the individual’s normal limits.

PC307 Fatigue - Physiological/Mental
Fatigue - Physiological/Mental is a factor when the individual’s diminished physical or mental
capability is due to an inadequate recovery, as a result of restricted or shortened sleep or physical
or mental activity during prolonged wakefulness. Fatigue may additionally be described as
acute, cumulative or chronic.

PC308 Circadian Rhythm Desynchrony
Circadian Rhythm Desynchrony is a factor when the individual’s normal, 24-hour rhythmic
biological cycle (circadian rhythm) is disturbed and it degrades task performance. This is caused
typically by night work or rapid movement (such as one time zone per hour) across several time
zones. Referred to as “shift lag” and “jet lag.” Time in the new time zone will lead to adaptation
and recovery; the amount of time depends on the number of time zones crossed and the direction
of travel. Recovery from shift lag may never occur.
