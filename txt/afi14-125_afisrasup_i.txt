                CRYPTOLOGIC MISSION CERTIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. Upon assignment to any line flying unit, Airborne Cryptologic Linguists will enter
Cryptologic Mission Certification Training. This training should be completed within 120 days
from the date of arrival to the line flying unit. (ANG will complete CMCT and initial CSPT at
the Senior Scout FTU in conjunction with MQT.)
2.2. CMCT. All Airborne Cryptologic Linguists, regardless of unit of assignment, will
complete area-specific CMCT before flying unsupervised on any operational sortie in a given
area. CMCT programs are developed for all Airborne Cryptologic Linguist crew positions by
designated lead units of primary responsibility and apply to all operators assigned in that position
regardless of assigned unit. Each CMCT plan will be coordinated with and approved by OG/CC
designated office of primary responsibility (OPR).
   2.2.1. CMCT for CTL linguist positions (see Paragraph 1.4.1.9), at a minimum, include the
   following: target/area knowledge (vocabulary/terminology, target knowledge/order of battle,
   geography), and aural exercises (transcription).
   2.2.2. CMCT for LCTL linguist positions (see Paragraph 1.4.1.9) will be determined by the
   squadron with the predominance of that particular LCTL asset and, at a minimum, include
   the following: target/area knowledge (vocabulary/terminology, target knowledge/order of
   battle, and geography), and when possible, aural exercises (transcription).
   2.2.3. CMCT for mission management (ie. AMS, AA, DLO) positions will, at a minimum,
   include the following: target academics (area specific order of battle/tactics, geo-political,
   analysis and reporting, threat warning and SIGINT mission management).
2.3. Completion of CMCT is required to attain CMC status for the applicable area. Successful
completion will be validated through the administration of a comprehensive CSPT which will
cover all areas of cryptologic training. Completion of CMCT will be documented, with inclusion
of CSPT score, on an AF Form 1381 USAF Certification of Aircrew Training, or equivalent, and
placed in the member’s training folder. The squadron operations officer will designate certifying
officials.
2.4. Once an Airborne Cryptologic Linguist has achieved CMC for a given area, he or she will
be required to complete CMCT continuation training IAW Attachment 2.
2.5. RC-135 MDS A irborne Cryptologic Linguists will fly operational sorties in area a
minimum of once every 180 days in order to maintain CMC status for a given area. Reserve
personnel may use simulated operational missions to comply with this requirement. The first
flight in area will occur within 180 days of certification. Waiver authority for this requirement is
AFISRA/A3 and will not be delegated lower than AFISRA/A3.
2.6. (Added-AFISRA) SME review of CSPT material will count as CMCT training code
(CXXXT) event for appointed SMEs.
AFI14-125_AFISRASUP_I 1 JUNE 2010                                                              11

                      CRYPTOLOGIC SKILLS PROFICIENCY TEST

3.1. All Airborne Cryptologic Linguists who successfully complete area-specific CMCT are
required to pass a CSPT at least once every 17 months to maintain CMC. Airborne Cryptologic
Linguists, who fail to successfully accomplish a CSPT event for any particular mission area, lose
CMC for that area. Commanders will direct additional training, as necessary to ensure all
Airborne Cryptologic Linguists attain and maintain a state of proficiency which will permit
immediate and successful completion of the unit’s assigned mission.
3.2. CSPT. The CSPT measures the results of the CMCT process. It provides a snapshot on
each area trained and is used for overall process improvement. Each CSPT will be designed to
measure the skills attained through CMCT and should equally cover all areas provided in CMCT
for that entity.
    3.2.1. Target knowledge tests will consist of any combination of target weapon system
    capability/tactics, subordination, location/areas, functional association, scenario
    identification, and general knowledge items.
        3.2.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) Target knowledge tests for CTL and LCTL positions will
        consist of 50-100 questions derived from applicable training materials covering identified
        core task list items. Minimum passing score is 85%.
        3.2.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) Target knowledge tests for Mission Management positions
        will consist of 50-300 questions derived from applicable training materials covering
        identified core task list items. If a member is testing for multiple areas, the test will
        contain no less than 25 questions per area tested. Minimum passing score is 85%.
    3.2.2. Aural skills evaluations methods may range from target specific transcription
    proficiency checks to aural recognition tests. Aural skills evaluation methods will be
    determined on specific unit mission requirements. Minimum passing scores for tests is 85%.
        3.2.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) Aural skills tests for CTL and LCTL positions will consist of
        50-100 questions derived from applicable training materials covering identified core task
        list items. CSPT content will test examinee’s ability to gist, and/or extract essential
        elements of information, and/or identify activity on a single pass.
3.3.   Units will administer the CSPT in accordance with the following guidelines:
    3.3.1. IAW the timelines/frequency specified in Attachment 2. ** Note: Depending on
    mission requirements, units may require more frequent testing, e.g., in conjunction with an
    individual’s qualification evaluation cycle to line up with area recertification requirements.
    3.3.2. A no-notice CSPT will be administered annually for a percentage of qualified
    Airborne Cryptologic Linguists as determined by Wings and subordinate Groups. A no-
    notice testing program provides commanders a sampling of daily airborne cryptologic
    linguist performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
    3.3.3. CSPT for CTL linguist positions (see Paragraph 1.4.1.9) will, at a minimum, include
    the following: academic examination (vocabulary/terminology, target knowledge/order of
    battle, and geography), and aural skills evaluation (transcription/aural recognition).
12                                                  AFI14-125_AFISRASUP_I 1 JUNE 2010


  3.3.4. CSPT for LCTL linguist positions (see Paragraph 1.4.1.9) will be determined by the
  squadron with the preponderance of the particular LCTL assets and, at a minimum, includes
  the following: academic examination (vocabulary/terminology, target knowledge/order of
  battle, and geography). If a complete CSPT battery exists for a LCTL, then the full test will
  be administered. If there is no CSPT for a specific language, the unit commander may waive
  any or all of the CSPT requirements for that language and appoint individuals as initial cadre,
  for CSPT purposes. Initial cadre individuals will be considered CMC until sufficient CSPT
  material is available. Document waivers on a Memorandum for Record (MFR), and place in
  the individual’s training folder.
     3.3.4.1. (Added-AFISRA) CSPT waivers for initial cadre must be reaccomplished until
     programs are approved. Once programs are approved, enroll members in CMCT.
  3.3.5. CSPT for 1A8X1 mission management (ie AMS, AA, DLO) positions will include an
  academic examination of the following material: area-specific order of battle/tactics,
  geo/political, analysis and reporting, threat warning, and SIGINT mission management
  (cryptanalysis, signals analysis, language analysis, and intelligence analysis). CSPT for these
  positions will also include an aural skills evaluation in the crewmember’s primary Resource
  Language Allocation (RLA) code. Aural skills evaluation requirements will be as directed
  by the OG.
  3.3.5. (AFISRA) Where approved tests exist, Mission Management position aural skills
  requirements will be met by completing the aural skills portion of CSPT in member’s
  primary RLA. If no approved test exists in primary RLA, use aural skills portion of CSPT in
  member’s secondary RLA where available.
  3.3.6. CMC operators who have completed certification in multiple areas may take
  combined academic tests when practical. However, a separate aural skills evaluation must be
  completed for each area of certification. In order to maintain CMC status, operators must be
  certified in at least one area. More specifically, an operator who is CSPT certified in more
  than one area need only take one CSPT, according to the frequency listed in Attachment 2, in
  order to maintain CMC status.
  3.3.7. Failure to pass a CSPT will result in loss of CMC status for that language/area
  certification. The affected individual will not participate as a crew member on operational
  missions in that language/area, unsupervised unless specifically waived. Place waiver in the
  individual’s training folder.
     3.3.7.1. (Added-AFISRA) Passing scores for CSPT will be 85% for both academic and
     aural skills portions. Test will be considered a failure if less than 85% is achieved on
     either portion.
     3.3.7.2. (Added-AFISRA) Member must repeat failed test portion if scoring below
     standards. Individuals are authorized to continue participating as unsupervised crew
     members for other language/areas in which they attain/maintain Combat Mission Capable
     (CMC) status.
  3.3.8. Restore CMC status by re-testing and successfully completing the CSPT.
     3.3.8.1. Re-testing will be accomplished no sooner than three duty days after the first
     failure. In the event of second failure, a third CSPT will be administered. In this
AFI14-125_AFISRASUP_I 1 JUNE 2010                                                             13


      situation the squadron commander will determine a sufficient period of time for study
      and additional training/preparation and will be documented in the member’s training
      folder.
      3.3.8.1. (AFISRA) A different version (or randomly generated version if computer-
      based testing is used) must be used for each re-test attempt.
      3.3.8.2. Document additional training/preparation time in the individual’s training folder.
      Detail what additional training was accomplished, time spent accomplishing the training,
      and the total number of hours spent completing additional training and study, and any
      extenuating circumstances.
      3.3.8.2. (AFISRA) Documentation of additional training must be certified by someone
      in the individual’s supervisory chain-of-command.
      3.3.8.3. Individuals failing to successfully complete the CSPT after three attempts are no
      longer certified to perform the cryptologic operational duties of an airborne cryptologic
      linguist. The unit will convene a special board chaired by the unit commander to review
      the case and: (1) make a recommendation to re-enter the individual into additional
      training; (2) seek a waiver, or (3) request a Flight Evaluation Board (FEB) in accordance
      with AFI 11-402 Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges,
      paragraph 4.3.5.
   3.3.9. Completion of the CSPT requirement will be documented in Aviation Resource
   Management System (ARMS), and individual training folders. ARMS documentation
   procedures and event code descriptions are located in Attachment 2.

Notes:
1. Instructors may dual-log this event.
2. RC-135 AMS/AA/DLO multiple-qualified operators will log for highest qualification.
3. External training may be logged if approved by squadron training office.
4. Non-experience (N)/Experienced (E) status for CMC is based on total hours as an Airborne
   Cryptologic Linguist in the applicable RLA, not total MDS specific hours.
5. CXXXT consists of any combination CMCT curriculum items for a total of 8 hours. No
   less than 6 hours of CMCT will be transcription-centric, either training or operational.
6. For AMS/AA/DLO positions holding a LCTL primary RLA, CXXXT consists of any
   combination CMCT for a total of 8 hours. Any transcription-centric training will be as
   determined or directed by OG.
7. Operational sorties are area-specific. Frequency is based on high threat (1/90) and low
   threat (1/180) areas. (Applies to RC-135 MDS ACLs only. See Para. 2.5.)

Prorating and look-back procedures apply as described in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS specific
Volume 1.
