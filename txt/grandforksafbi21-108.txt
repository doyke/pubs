        identified on the danger tag that manual operation is authorized shall be operated
        manually.
GRANDFORKSAFBI21-108 30 APRIL 2013                                                            5


      5.4.2. Personnel authorized to perform lock-out/tag-out procedures must ensure that the
      door motor clutch is disengaged as part of their lockout procedures before authorizing
      manual control.
      5.4.3. If a malfunctioning door is to be moved by tow vehicle or truck, a Maintenance
      Production Superintendent (ACC) or 319 OSS/QAE (T/A) must authorize and oversee
      the movement.
   5.5. When severe weather threatens (lightning within 5 miles or winds exceeding 35 knots),
   MOC personnel will notify production supervisors who will ensure their respective hangar
   doors are closed.
   5.6. All hangar doors should be kept closed whenever possible.        A minimum opening
   clearance of 10 feet is required if left open for any reason.
   5.7. Hangar doors will require lock-out/tag-out of controls to prevent operation if safety
   equipment (such as alarms, interlock switches, etc.) are non-operational. A two-man concept
   may be used for a work-around if safety equipment is non-operational until discrepancies are
   corrected.
6. Cold Weather Procedures:
   6.1. When the ambient air temperature is 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) or
   below, the following precautions apply in addition to those covered in the normal procedures.
   WARNING: DURING FREEZING WEATHER, HANGAR DOORS ARE NOT TO
   BE LEFT OPEN. EXPOSING HANGAR INFRASTRUCTURE TO FREEZING
   CONDITIONS WILL CAUSE EXTENSIVE HANGAR DAMAGE.
      6.1.1. Ensure increased emphasis and attention by flight line expediters, production
      supervisors, maintenance operations, facility managers and occupants.
      6.1.2. Hangar doors will be kept closed until the aircraft or equipment has reached the
      hangar and will only be opened when the aircraft or equipment is positioned for entry or
      exit, and closed immediately thereafter.
      6.1.3. Brief all appropriate personnel on use of proper hangar door procedures to
      safeguard hangar conditions during cold weather.
      6.1.4. Before opening or closing hangar doors, ensure the door tracks are clean and free
      of debris, ice, snow, and other objects that may hinder door movement.
      6.1.5. Ensure outside weather shields are not covered with ice or snow, or frozen to the
      ground, before moving doors.
   6.2. Because of the possibility of extensive hangar infrastructure damage in freezing
   weather, lock-out/tag-out procedures may be modified under these circumstances to
   accommodate the most expeditious closing of the doors.
      6.2.1. Maintenance Production Superintendent (ACC) or 319 OSS/QAE (T/A) must
      authorize and oversee the movement and verify that the door motor clutch is disengaged
      before proceeding.
      6.2.2. Once the doors are closed, and hangar infrastructure damage mitigated, lock-
      out/tag-out procedures must be immediately completed.
