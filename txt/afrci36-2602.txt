This instruction implements and extends Air Force Policy Directive 36-26, Total Force Development. It
explains how an individual may apply for undergraduate flying training leading to an aeronautical rating
and how applications are processed for individuals applying for pilot, combat systems officer, and air bat-
tle manager training through the Air Force Reserve. AFRCI 36-2602, Application Procedures For Under-
graduate Flying Training And Air Battle Manager, requires the maintenance of information protected by
the Privacy Act of 1974. The authorities to collect the prescribed records in this instruction are Title 10
U.S.C., Section 8013. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision is substantially changed and must be completely reviewed. This revision includes appli-
cation procedures for Air Battle Manager and clarifies policy for waiver and exception to policy requests
for age and commissioned service.


1. Eligibility Criteria. Applicants who meet the following criteria are eligible for Undergraduate Flying
Training (UFT) and Air Battle Manager (ABM) consideration:
   1.1. Eligible for Officer Training School (OTS) as prescribed by AFI 36-2013, Officer Training
   School (OTS) and Airman Commissioning Programs.
   1.2. Meet all medical standards specified in AFI 48-123, Medical Examination and Standards, for
   pilot, combat systems officer (navigator), and air battle manager training. Pilot candidates must suc-
   cessfully complete Medical Flight Screening and Flying Class 1 (MFS/FC1) at Brooks City AFB TX
   and include copy of HQ AETC/SG certified physical in UFT application.

    1.3. Must enter UFT/ABM before reaching 30 years of age.
    1.4. Commissioned officers must not exceed 5 years total federal commissioned service. Note: Age
    and commissioned service waiver consideration is given to applicants who can document that an Air
    Force administrative, counseling, or medical error occurred within the last 2 years that prevented the
    applicant from applying for UFT when otherwise eligible. See Attachment 2 for age and commis-
    sioned service waiver or exception to policy criteria and procedures. If the applicant meets this crite-
    rion, they must submit a complete copy of the UFT application with the request for an age or
    commissioned service waiver or exception to policy. All requests must be staffed through Air Force
    Reserve Command channels. Waivers are reviewed on an individual basis and, if approved, allow the
    applicant a one time opportunity to compete for UFT. Approval authority rests with CSAF.
    1.5. Attain minimum required Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) scores. Items 1, 2, and 3
    below apply to pilot and combat systems officer (navigator) applicants, only items 2 and 3 apply to air
    battle manager applicants. See AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System, for
    AFOQT procedures. For the purpose of this application, AFOQT scores do not expire. Requirements:
    1.6. Score in the 25th percentile or higher in the respective category (pilot or navigator technical)
    composite for which they are applying.
    1.7. The combined total score of the pilot and the navigator composites must be at least 50th percen-
    tile.
    1.8. At no time shall the pilot or navigator composite be less than the 10th percentile
    1.9. Complete Test of Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS), (pilot candidates only).
    1.10. The TBAS score combined with the pilot AFOQT score and private flying time produces the
    pilot candidate selection method (PCSM) score.

2. Ineligibility Factors. The following individuals are ineligible for UFT consideration:
    2.1. Persons permanently disqualified for aviation service at any time.
    2.2. Officers who have illegally, wrongfully, or improperly experimented with, used, possessed, sold,
    or transferred any narcotic substance, dangerous drug, intoxicating inhaled substance, or controlled
    substance as established by Title 21, U.S.C. Section 812 when supported by evidence.
    2.3. Applicants who have declined UFT after selection.
    2.4. Individuals eliminated from any flying training course conducted by or for the Armed Forces of
    the United States, with the following provisions:
    2.5. Those eliminated for military deficiency or self-initiated elimination (SIE) reasons.
    2.6. Individuals eliminated for reasons other than those mentioned above, unless specifically recom-
    mended for further pilot or navigator training at the time they were eliminated by AETC.

3. How To Apply. Applicants who are not unit assigned must schedule an appointment with the nearest
Reserve officer accessions recruiter. The Reserve officer accessions recruiter:
    3.1. Provides initial counseling on Reserve participation and UFT eligibility.
    3.2. Schedules the applicant for the AFOQT and obtains the results.

   3.3. If test scores are disqualifying, advises the individual of the results and the eligibility date for
   retesting; refer to AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System.
   3.4. Schedules the applicant for the Test of Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS)
   3.5. Schedules an appointment for appropriate physical examination for the flying training desired as
   specified in AFI 48-123, Medical Examination and Standards, then:

                    AGE OR COMMISSIONED SERVICE WAIVER REQUEST

A2.1. Include (in memo format): Appropriate letterhead; current address; and request for age or com-
missioned service waiver. (See AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official Communications)

A2.2. Applying for an Age or Commissioned Service Waiver:
    A2.2.1. If you can document an Air Force administrative, counseling, or medical error that occurred
    within the last 2 years that prevented you from applying for UFT while otherwise eligible, submit a
    complete copy of the UFT application with request for age or commissioned service waiver through
    your immediate Squadron commander, Wing/CC, NAF/CC, to HQ AFRC/A1BB for processing to
    CSAF for final disposition. The disapproval authority within the chain of command is vested in the
    MAJCOM/CC or delegated authority. Disapproved packages will be returned to the NAF/CC.
    A2.2.2. Administrative error: Committed by an Air Force agency otherwise beyond your control.
    Examples of administrative errors include:
       A2.2.2.1. An application package was not properly screened by the MPF or recruiter and returned
       without action; MPF or recruiting mailed application to wrong address or failed to forward to HQ
       AFRC/A1BB for board consideration.
       A2.2.2.2. An incomplete or incorrect medical form.
    A2.2.3. Counseling error: An Air Force agency gave you incorrect information and you could not
    verify the information on your own. For example, you were told you could not apply for UFT when
    you actually met the eligibility criteria.
    A2.2.4. Medical error: An incorrect diagnosis of your medical condition prevented you from applying
    when you were otherwise eligible. For example, you were diagnosed as having a disqualifying condi-
    tion, but a review showed you were medically qualified. Attach original medical form and the medical
    authorityâ€™s supporting comments when you submit and age or commissioned service waiver request
    based on a medical error.
    A2.2.5. Exceptions to policy (ETP): Applicants that do not meet the above criteria may request an
    exception to policy through their MAJCOM chain of command as directed in
    A2.2.6. Age and commissioned service limits exists to protect the interests of the total rated force and
    should not be taken lightly. Exceptions to policy will normally be granted only in rare circumstances
    when a commander can document sustained, exceptional performance and deviation from policy is
    minor. Further, commanders must specifically and explicitly justify why supporting an ETP for an
    individual, considering the pool of fully qualified applicants, is in the best interest of the Air Force
    Reserve. Each ETP imposes potential increased risk to operational safety and effectiveness. Only the
    rare, truly exceptional individual should be endorsed and forwarded through the chain of command
    for ETP consideration.
    A2.2.7. Include names, dates, and specific details to document your case. Submit your age or com-
    missioned service waiver request with your entire UFT application package. All requests must include
    written justification from the Squadron, Wing, and Numbered Air Force Commander. Send requests
    to: HQ AFRC/A1BB, 155 Richard Ray Blvd. Robins AFB GA 31098-1635.
