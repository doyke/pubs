This instruction implements AFPD 24-2. This instruction applies to 19th Airlift Wing, 189th
Airlift Wing, and commercial contract transportation companies involved in the movement and
staging of classified, explosives, and NBC on LRAFB. It establishes general procedures for the
processing and parking of DoD and DoD contract commercial vehicles carrying Arms,
Ammunition and Explosive (AA&E), Classified materials, and Biological Nuclear Radioactive
and Explosives (CBNRE). Local shipments of DoD classified and explosive materials and
Biological Nuclear Radioactive and Explosives (CBNRE). It assigns specific parking and secure
holding areas on Little Rock Air Force Base (LRAFB) for vehicles containing these materials.
Government and commercial contract vehicles containing Department of Defense (DoD)
shipments of classified and explosives. Procedures and checklists provided must be
implemented by the appropriate base agencies during applicable events. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained In Accordance With
(IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW

contingencies, and increased FPCON events. They may request access to LRAFB for loading,
offloading, or in response to Emergencies/Contingencies and FPCON BRAVO, CHARLIE, and
DELTA. Emergency/contingency and FPCON BRAVO, CHARLIE, and DELTA related
situations may arise that will require a motor vehicle transporting DOD-owned AA&E to gain
expedited secure holding at the nearest DOD installation or DOD contractor facility. Under
these conditions, the AA&E-laden motor vehicle will be allowed access, and SF will escort that
vehicle to the secure holding area for temporary parking. This will also apply to vehicles
transporting transuranic waste material, IAW AFMAN 32-4004, para 2.12. In the event that the
Hazard Class Division (HCD) and Net Explosive Weight (N.E.W) of the AA&E on the vehicle is
not commensurate with para 1.4., Quantity Distance (QD)-sited secure holding area, the
installation Commander or facility director will provide temporary parking accommodations at
an alternate location on the facility that affords maximum QD protection IAW the principle of
acceptable risk. If the vehicle contains CAT I or CAT II AA&E, a secure holding area with
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) will be required. If such
an area is not available, the installation Commander/facility director will make arrangements to
post a 24-hour guard in lieu of the IDS or CCTV. IAW DOD 4500.9R, Chapter 205, Chapter Q,
para 1.b.
     1.1. Secure Holding Area for Motor Vehicles is provided when a vehicle arrives and cannot
     be unloaded, or is awaiting a thru load. In this case, the driver or other carrier representative
     should contact the destination Cargo Movement Section in advance so the activity can make
     appropriate arrangements. A SECURE HOLDING AREA will prevent DOD munitions and
     other sensitive cargo shipments from being exposed at a local truck stop or motel parking lot
     (DoD 4500.9R). To obtain SECURE HOLDING a driver or other representative must
     contact the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command DTTS at 800 826-0794 to obtain
     secure holding or the LRAFB Command Post (501 987-3200) for emergency assistance.
        1.1.1. A protective area has been set aside on LRAFB for safe haven, refuge, and secure
        holding of government and commercial contract vehicles laden with DoD classified and
        explosive cargo. A SECURE HOLDING AREA has been established on LRAFB for
        SECURE HOLDING of Government or Commercial contract of CBNRE, AA&E or
        classified materials. This holding area is located on Marshall Road approximately 1,800
        feet inside the explosive route entrance to LRAFB and may be used to stage vehicles
        containing up to the explosive limits listed in Table 1.

     1.2.1. The protective holding area does not have bathroom/toilet, telephone, or eating
     facilities available.
     1.2.2. The driver must stay with the cargo and use on-board truck facilities.
     1.2.3. Granting of secure holding does not relieve the carrier of liability under the Bill of
     Lading (BL) contract of carriage.
     1.2.4. The US Government does not assume responsibility for the shipment or carrier
     equipment so long as terms and conditions of providing secure holding are not
     inconsistent with those of the BL contract of carriage.
     1.2.5. It is within the prerogative of the installation Commander/facility director to
     require carrier personnel to remain with the vehicle to fulfill Transportation Protective
     Services (TPS) requirements.
     1.2.6. The holding area is strictly temporary in nature and the vehicle(s) must be
     removed NLT 0545 or as soon as the Installation Commander or civil authority
     determines the shipment is no longer required to remain in the area.
     1.2.7. All personnel engaged directly, or indirectly, with the operations involving
     CBRNE items must be thoroughly briefed on safety operations including emergencies,
     firefighting procedures, and evacuation distances.
     1.2.8. Vehicles utilized for transporting DOD/DOE shipments will be equipped with
     appropriate safety items IAW DOD/DOT directives.
     1.2.9. Explosive-laden vehicles will not be left unattended while in the suspect vehicle
     site holding area with the exception of extreme emergencies. In the event of
     emergencies, vehicles will be chocked and the vehicle brake set before driver(s) depart.
     1.2.10. Regardless of category, all vehicles parked at the protective holding area will be
     moved no later than 0545 to allow for the opening of the Marshall Road gate for
     incoming base traffic at 0600. Personnel will be notified and respond in a timely manner
     for escorting and off-loading of material.
     1.2.11. If notified of Presidential support requirements while vehicles containing
     explosives are being held in the LRAFB protective area, the 19 LRS/LGR deputy will
     take whatever steps are necessary to off-load and remove those vehicles from the
     protective area before the President arrives.
  1.3. Consolidated Listing and Impact Assessment of Short-Falls and Limiting Factors.
     1.3.1. In the event the Net Explosive Weight (N.E.W) of the AA&E on the vehicle
     exceeds Quantity Distance (QD) limits listed in table 1, the installation commander will
     provide temporary parking accommodations at an alternate location that affords
     maximum QD protection IAW the principle of acceptable risk. If the vehicle contains
     CAT I or CAT II AA&E, a secure holding area with Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or
     Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) will be required. If such an area is not available, the
     installation commander will make arrangements to post a 24-hour guard in lieu of the
     IDS or CCTV. CBRN primary parking location will be Stub 7 (Christmas Tree area); the
     alternate area will be compass rose.

     contract vehicles laden with CBNRE, AA&E, or classified materials.
     1.5. Wing Weapons Safety Office will conduct periodic surveillance visits/spot inspections
     of the suspect vehicle site parking to ensure it is maintained IAW AFMAN 91-201 and the
     approved explosive site plan. When deficiencies are noted, contact the OPR for corrective
     actions. Provide follow-up to ensure timely actions are complete.
2. 189AW. The 189th utilizes the 19th Munitions Storage Area (MSA). The 19th MSA
receiving hours are 0700-1600 hours daily. When a shipment for the 189th occurs after duty
hours, the 19th LRS Cargo Movement Section inspects and places these vehicles with munitions
shipments for the 189th in the suspect vehicle area. Once notified, 189th Munitions Element
personnel will respond on the next official duty day along with a 19th SFS escort to move the
explosive laden vehicle to 19 MSA by NLT 0545L so Marshall Road can be opened for
incoming base traffic.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES. It is essential that all forces maintain a constant state of readiness to
respond to a request for SAFE HAVEN based on emergencies, contingencies, and increased
FPCON events. All LRAFB personnel subject to responding to a SAFE HAVEN request will
receive appropriate training IAW Emergency Management PLAN.
