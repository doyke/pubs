(AMW/SE), 375th Civil Engineer Squadron (CES) personnel, and IAW AFI 91-203, Air Force
Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction, for operation of hangar doors at Scott AFB.
A18.1.2. Squadron commanders and contractor-site supervisors have overall responsibility;
however, the individual must strive to maintain safe practices through common sense and good
judgment.
A18.1.3. All 375 AMW and 932 AW organizations owning hangars on Scott AFB will comply
with all procedures in this instruction. The 126 ARW will comply with 126 MXG MOI 32-1.
A18.2. Identification of Hazards.
A18.2.1. Reference AFI 91-203 Chapter 24 Section 24.14.
A18.3. Hangar Door Awareness Training.

Awareness Training requirements IAW AFI91-203 Chapter 24 Section 24.14. “Only qualified
personnel, approved by the squadron commander or designated representative, shall be
authorized to operate hangar doors. Operators shall be thoroughly familiar with operating
instructions and precautions necessary for safe operation. Written operating procedures outlining
all safety precautions to operate the doors shall be posted next to all operating controls.
Qualified personnel will be documented in writing by the squadron commander or designated
representative.” (AFI 91-203, 24.14.8.3.)
A18.3.2. On-the-Job Training (OJT) Program. All agencies shall use the standardized hands-on

unit specific approved training lesson plan. This approved plan will be used to train all
personnel who operate electric and/or manual hangar doors (maintenance, supply/equipment
deliveries, etc.). At a minimum, qualification training will include hangar door hazards,
emergency procedures, and hangar door operations.
A18.3.3. Documentation. Training will be documented with AF Form 2426, Training Request
and Completion, for automated database tracking (i.e., G081, CAMS, and AFORMS); if
unavailable, it will be documented on the AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard
Continuation/Command JQS. Training will also be documented on the individual’s AF Form 55,
Employee Safety and Health Record, if applicable.

                                     Attachment 19 (Added)
 CRASH DAMAGED OR DISABLED AIRCRAFT RECOVERY (CDDAR) PROGRAM

A19.1. This attachment provides a concise document that establishes procedures and
responsibilities for the assignment of duties related to CDDAR operations. Throughout this
instruction, office names have been included to reflect the partnership between the 375 AMW,
126 ARW, and the 932 AW.
A19.2. The 375 AMW/CC is responsible for implementing policy, plans, and agreements to
ensure compliance with established recovery programs. The 375 AMW/CC or designated
representative, as stated in AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program
Planning and Operations, will determine the degree of emergency and make the decision
regarding the speed with which the runway is cleared. Scott AFB will return to operational
status as soon as practical after a mishap.
A19.2.1. Host Base and Tenant Units. The CDDAR program applies to all host and tenant
flying organizations on Scott AFB. Tenant units shall publish a unit instruction containing
specific responsibilities and procedures for CDDAR. Programs shall be established to recover
crashed/damaged or disabled (assigned/transient) aircraft in minimum time and consistent with
the following actions:
A19.2.1.1. Open the runway for operational use.
A19.2.1.2. Prevent secondary damage to the aircraft.
A19.2.1.3. Preserve evidence for mishap or accident investigations.
A19.2.1.4. Safety of personnel involved with recovery operations.
A19.2.1.5. Minimize pollution and or damage to personal property and land, if mishap occurs on
private property.
A19.3. IAW AFI 91-204 when an aircraft is under investigation by the Interim Safety
Board (ISB) or the Safety Investigation Board (SIB), recovery operations will not proceed
until the board president releases the aircraft. Personnel who are not engaged in the
investigation will remain outside of the recovery area. The Crash Recovery Team (CRT) may be
called upon to perform tasks as required by the investigation team.
A19.4. The CDDAR program instruction is procedural and does not take precedence over
aircraft-specific technical data in recovering crashed, damaged, or disabled
aircraft. Warning: Incidents involving aircraft manufactured with composite material may
cause serious injury or death to individuals exposed to carbon fibers released from burning
composites. Technical Order (T.O.) 00-105E-9, Aerospace Emergency Rescue and Mishap
Response Information (Emergency Services), the 375 AMW CEMP 10-2, and the 375 AMW
SPLAN, and AFI 91-204 contain information regarding aircraft-specific composite component
locations, and should be consulted when responding to aircraft incidents. Transient aircraft’s
home base should be contacted to determine composite material risks and requirements for
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Caution: The aircraft and crash site will be disturbed
only to the extent required to eliminate any potentially dangerous situation to the aircraft, support
equipment, or personnel, and will remain in an undisturbed state until the aircraft is released to
maintenance by the Incident Commander (IC).
AFI21-101_AMCSUP_SCOTTAFBSUP 5 JULY 2013                                                         7


A19.5. Support for CDDAR after normal duty hours (0700-1700).
A19.6. If immediate response by the Host/Tenant unit CDDAR teams is required during
normal operating periods or duty hours, the Primary/Secondary Crash Net and/or the 375
AMW/932 AW/126 ARW Command Post (CP) will be used for notification. The respective
command post will contact the 932 AW/126 ARW MXG/MOC, to request approval for
assistance. All units will develop emergency recall or mobilization rosters to identify and notify
required recovery team members outside normal operating hours. Each unit will provide a recall
roster to their Command Post for use during emergency recall. Units must also account for team
members being deployed, temporary duty, and on leave.
A19.7. Scott AFB Wing and Tenant CDDAR Responsibilities.

A23.7.1. Accurate and timely reporting is essential. Use the FOD Damage and Mishap
Investigation Report or the FOD Damage Reporting/Notification Contact List (see Attachment
24, Attachment 25) to aid with reporting notifications. When FOD is discovered, maintenance
personnel will perform no maintenance actions or modify anything at the incident location. The
affected aircraft will not be released to aircrew until 375 AMW Safety and the FOD Monitors
have investigated the incident and released the aircraft. The 375 AMW Safety will determine if
