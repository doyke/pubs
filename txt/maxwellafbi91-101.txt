This instruction implements AFPD 91-1, Nuclear Weapons and Systems Surety. It defines
responsibilities and establishes local procedures to identify and monitor Nuclear Certified
Equipment (NCE) and establishes local procedures for reporting suspected NCE deficiencies
(flagword) “DULL SWORD” to the Wing Safety office. It applies to all military and civilian
personnel in units that handle or maintain NCE. It does not apply to AFRC or ANG units.
Submit an AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to the OPR to recommend
changes to this publication. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in
this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

1. General. Reinvigoration of the Air Force nuclear mission is a high priority. Reporting
malfunctions, failures, and abnormalities involving Nuclear Certified Equipment (NCE) in use at
non-nuclear units is one aspect of the nuclear reinvigoration effort. The DULL SWORD nuclear
deficiency report provides a means of trend analysis to identify issues that could affect the safety
and reliability of an NCE asset for use in nuclear operations. This instruction serves to define
responsibilities and establishes local procedures to identify and monitor NCE, as well as
procedures for reporting suspected NCE deficiencies to the Wing Safety office for investigation
and up-channel reporting as warranted. Furthermore, when a product quality deficiency report is
submitted involving a nuclear certified asset, the unit will also complete a Maxwell AFB Form
385, DULL SWORD Report Worksheet. The 42d Air Base Wing Safety office will determine if
the product quality deficiency also warrants DULL SWORD reporting.
2. Responsibilities:

       in section 3 to Wing Safety utilizing the Maxwell AFB Form ##, DULL SWORD Report
       Worksheet.
3. DULL SWORD Conditions:
    3.1. Refer to AFMAN 91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports, for complete
    criteria.
       3.1.1. Malfunction, failure, or anomaly during operations or testing, potentially resulting
       in a safety or coded device to arm or be left in an unsafe condition (e.g., Safe and Arm

     mounting structure, fifth wheels) that support the load or transmit the towing or braking
     force.
     3.1.4. Inadequate restraint of loads attributed to trailer tie down points or tie down
     patterns.
     3.1.5. Unsafe condition or improper operation of the hydraulic, mechanical, and
     structural components of lift vehicles (e.g., forklifts and K-loaders) resulting in
