                              FIRE PREVENTION PRACTICES

3.1. Inspection and Prevention. The primary responsibility for the Fire Prevention Element is
to monitor and evaluate unit commanders’ fire prevention programs to ensure compliance with
established guidelines. Fire inspectors will visit all facilities at least annually to ensure prompt
detection of deficiencies and elimination of fire hazards. These visits do not relieve the
commander or the facility manager of the responsibility of identifying deficiencies and hazards
in assigned work centers. At the end of each fire prevention visit, an AF Form 1487, Fire
Prevention Visit Report, will be issued if a fire safety deficiency or hazard is identified. If an AF
Form 1487 is issued to your organization, the following corrective actions shall be taken by the
facility manager:
   3.1.1. If hazards cannot be corrected on the spot, implement interim control measures to
   reduce the risk to an acceptable level.
   3.1.2. The AF Form 1487 will be sent through the unit’s chain-of-command for commanders
   signature.
   3.1.3. Fire Safety Deficiencies (FSD) will be identified on AF Form 1487, and if they cannot
   be corrected by the facility manager or unit, they will be programmed for correction using the
   AF Form 332.
   3.1.4. Facility managers will ensure the AF Form 1487 is signed and returned to the Fire
   Prevention Element by the established suspense date.
3.2. Fire Safety Deficiency. If a FSD is listed on the AF Form 1487, the associated FSD shall
be annotated on the AF Form 332 for proper ranking within the respective group. The FSD will
be assigned using guidance from AFI 32-10141. The following actions are required in addition
to AF Form 332 annotation:
   3.2.1. FSD 1’s if not corrected within 24 hours or provided with a CE Work Order number
   require an Operatrional Risk Management (ORM) plan to be developed. A template will be
   provide by the Fire Prevention Element but it is the organization responsiblility to route the
   ORM package for Wing Commander signature and approval.
   3.2.2. FSD 2’s if not corrected within 24 hours or provided with a CE Work Order number
   require an ORM to be developed. FSD II’s ORMs will only be routed to Group
   Commanders for signatures and implementation.
   3.2.3. All FSD 1 and 2 deficiencies will be briefed to the ESOH Council.
   3.2.4. FSD 3’s do not require an ORM.
3.3. Fire Reporting Procedures. Quick and accurate fire reporting is essential to minimize
damage and injuries. All fires, regardless of size (even if extinguished) must be reported to the
fire department. Should a fire occur, take the following actions:
   3.3.1. SOUND THE ALARM (verbal or mechanical) AND EVACUATE THE BUILDING!
   3.3.2. CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT by dialing 911 from any on-installation or family
   housing phone. NOTE: If you dial 911 from a cellular phone you will reach an off-

   installation emergency dispatch center. Tell the dispatcher that you are on either the Air
   Base or Weapons Station and they will transfer you to a JBC Fire Emergency Services
   dispatch center. You can also program 843-963-8082 into your cell phone as this is the JBC
   actual 911 phone number. Facility managers are responsible to ensure phone decals are in
   place. If the building’s fire alarm system has been activated, reporting by phone is still
   required.
   3.3.3. When the fire alarm communication center operator answers the phone, remain calm
   and provide the following information:
       3.3.3.1. Name and call back number.
       3.3.3.2. Building number or location involved; room number or area.
       3.3.3.3. Nature of the fire if known. Do not hang up until instructed to do so by the
       operator.
       3.3.3.4. Try to extinguish fires if evacuation is underway, you feel you are not
       endangering yourself, and the fire department has been contacted.
       3.3.3.5. If time permits, close the doors and windows in the fire area, but do not lock the
       doors. Post someone outside of the facility to direct the responding firefighters to the fire
       scene.
       3.3.3.6. Willful transmission, or reporting of a false fire or emergency alarm, is
       prohibited. This action may be punishable under federal law and the UCMJ.
3.4. Fire Evacuation Drills. Fire drills will be scheduled and conducted by responsible facility
managers or unit safety representatives at least once a year unless specified otherwise. Fire drills
shall be coordinated with the Fire Prevention Element (963-3121/794-7889). A fire department
representative may observe and evaluate the drill. The following frequencies shall be used for
conducting fire drills in specific facilities.
   3.4.1. Monthly. All installation schools, pre-schools, youth centers, school age program,
   home day care providers, and child development centers will hold evacuation drills monthly.
   3.4.2. Quarterly. Medical facilities
   3.4.3. Semi-Annually. Munitions storage areas (area evacuation drills).
   3.4.4. Annually. All remaining facilities.
3.5. Emergency Response of Fire Vehicles. Persons who are authorized to repair and/or block
streets, or fire lanes, will notify the fire alarm communication center operator at least 24 hours
before such restriction takes effect, and when removed. Fire lanes will not be less than 20 feet of
unobstructed width and will be marked with signs.
3.6. Assembly and Recreational Facilities. These facilities require special precautions to
prevent fires due to the potential for high loss of life and property.
   3.6.1. Managers or their assistants (designated in writing) of assembly facilities are
   responsible to ensure these facilities are left in a fire-safe condition at the close of business.
   Designated personnel will conduct daily closing inspections. This requirement will not be
   delegated to janitorial personnel.

  3.6.2. Managers of assembly occupancies shall provide a minimum of one facility
  supervisor, or a designated employee, when the occupant load is expected to exceed 250.
  This individual is responsible to direct personnel to exits in an orderly manner in the event of
  an emergency. Where the occupant load exceeds 250, additional designated personnel will
  be assigned at a ratio of one designated employee for every 250 occupants, unless otherwise
  permitted by the following:
     3.6.2.1. The ratio of designated employees to occupants will be permitted to be reduced
     when, the existence of an approved, supervised, automatic sprinkler system and the
     nature of the event warrant. Approval authority will be provided by the fire department.

  decorations are to be used, only fire retardant types will be permitted.

     every six months, or more frequently, to prevent grease accumulation. Documentation
     will be maintained in TAB E of the fire prevention folder.
     3.6.5.4. Cooking is not permitted under kitchen hoods without all filters installed. Filters
     must be of an approved baffle type meeting UL 1046 and be maintained in a good state of
     repair.
     3.6.5.5. The exhaust system must be in operation whenever cooking equipment is being
     used.
     3.6.5.6. If an exhaust fan motor is shut down or removed for repair or replacement,
     equipment served by that exhaust system will not be used until the fan is restored to
     service.
     3.6.5.7. Deep fryers will be equipped with a separate high-limit control in addition to the
     adjustable operating control (thermostat) to shut off fuel or energy when the cooking oil
     temperature reaches 475 degrees Fahrenheit. These devices shall be tested and
     documented annually.
