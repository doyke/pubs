This instruction formerly identified as Career Assistance Advisors (CAA) has been renamed. It
is substantially revised and incorporates requirements set forth in former Air Force Instruction
(AFI) 36-2252, First Term Airmen Center and AFI 36-2809, Career Assistance Advisor of the
Year Award. It adds significant new duty requirements for Career Assistance Advisors and
provides guidance on the implementation and operation of base-level enlisted professional
enhancement (EPE) programs and the First Term Airmen Center. The EPE programs are
designed to complement the leadership and professional development Airmen receive from Basic
Military Training School (BMTS) and Professional Military Education (PME), as well as
augment lessons learned from supervisory and leadership experiences in an effort to prepare
Airmen for greater supervisory and leadership roles as they progress through their AF careers.
EPE programs include the First Term Airmen Center (FTAC), the Informed Decision Seminar,
and Senior Noncommissioned Officer/Noncommissioned Officer professional enhancement
seminars (SNCOPE/NCOPE). This AFI outlines the responsibilities of each level of command.
This publication does not apply to Air National Guard (ANG), Air Force Reserve (AFR) units or

   available for CAA duty, MAJCOMs may request AFPC Airman Assignments Division,
   Support Assignments Branch, (HQ AFPC/DPAA2) to advertise requirements using EQUAL-
   Plus to identify a volunteer as an exception.
   2.2.2. HQ AFPC/DPAA, Airman Assignments Division is the final approval/disapproval

provides a unique opportunity to create an environment for Airmen to further develop their
warrior ethos and continued expeditionary mindset. All FTA must attend an FTAC and are not
required to attend Right Start. Supervisors’ support and involvement with individuals attending
FTAC are critical to the future success of Airmen.
   4.1.1. All Air Force bases will be required to establish an FTAC unless an exception is
   requested from the wing commander through the MAJCOM and AFPC to HQ USAF/A1PF.
   Exception to Policy (ETP) requests will include a description of how FTA assigned will

designed to augment and reinforce (not replace) information taught in Basic Military Training,
technical training, ancillary training, PME, and job experience.

4.4. Volunteer instructors teaching in FTAC, NCOPE, and SNCOPE must follow the Air Force
standardized lesson plans in order to ensure the content is delivered in manner consistent with
the target audience.
4.5. A consolidated Professional Development Center (PDCs): The creation of a
consolidated professional development facility serving the needs of the total force population of
a base is encouraged. Bases with innovative ideas, outstanding additional courses, and cutting-
edge consolidated centers are encouraged to forward this information to HQ AFPC/DPSIDA and
HQ AF/A1 through their MAJCOM for review.

5.1. CAAs at every installation will publicize and conduct an Informed Decision Seminar each
month (more often if necessary) to meet the needs of the installation’s populace regardless of
unit of assignment (including all tenant units). The seminar is an educational experience
specifically designed to enhance one’s knowledge of Air Force benefits, highlighted program
requirements, and processes. The goal is to ensure personnel obtain the needed information in
order to make the best decision for them and their family. FTA and STA 12-15 months prior to
their DOS are required to attend unless pending involuntary separation.
5.2. Unit commanders (including tenant commanders) are responsible to ensure active duty

6.1. AFPC/DPSIDA maintains the Air Force Knowledge Now Community of Practice (CoP)
titled ―CAA/FTAC/EPE.‖ This site will be used to disseminate information to CAAs, FTAC
NCOICs and others as deemed necessary by the site administrator (AFPC/DPSIDA) and will
serve as central repository for approved lesson plans related to professional enhancement.

129, Transmission of Information Via the Internet and applicable supplements.
6.3. Retrieval Applications Website (RAW): RAW provides CAAs reenlistment statistics by
Air Force, MAJCOM, base, unit, and AFSC. CAAs may utilize this information to prepare
briefings for base leadership and analyze potential trends. RAW is the only approved site for
CAAs to obtain reenlistment rates. The rules for calculating reenlistment rates are complex;
therefore, CAAs will not attempt to manually track reenlistment rates. Additionally, completion
of all professional enhancement courses will be updated via RAW to ensure historical attendance
data is available on all personnel.
6.4. CAA Annual Report: In order to assist the Air Staff in effectively gauging the success of
programs implemented to achieve balance in the areas of force health, retention, and professional
enhancement, CAAs are required to submit annual reports of activities and observations.
     6.4.1. Annual Reports will be processed as follows:
        6.4.1.1. HQ AFPC/DPSIDA will request information pertinent to the programs to all

        for report.
        6.4.1.2. Reports are based on fiscal year results and are due to HQ AFPC/DPSIDA NLT
        31 October each year. They will be routed through wing commander/command chief

        6.4.1.3. HQ AFPC/DPSIDA will provide HQ AF/A1PF copies of individual unit reports
        as well as a consolidated report NLT 1 December each year.
     6.4.2. At a minimum, the report must address the following categories:
        6.4.2.1. Major factors affecting retention at base level including unique circumstances
        (e.g. A-76 studies, privatization, etc.).
        6.4.2.2. A summary of local plans to positively impact force shaping objectives,
        including seminars, job fairs, etc.
