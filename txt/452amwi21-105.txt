This Instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space
Maintenance. This instruction extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction 21-101, Aircraft and
Equipment Maintenance Management. This instruction establishes responsibilities and
procedures for Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). The 452 AMW does not have any
ASIP aircraft assigned and will follow procedures in accordance with (IAW) Technical Order
(TO) 1C-135-38, Aircraft Structural Integrity Program USAF Series -135 Aircraft, TO 1C-17A-
6, Inspection Requirements Manual, TO 1C-17A-6WC-2, Home Station Check Workcards, TO
1C-17A-2-31JG-30-1, Indicating and Recording Systems Recorders, and this instruction for the
Individual Aircraft Tracking Program (IATP). This instruction applies to all personnel, military
and civilians, within the 452d Air Mobility Wing. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using AF IMT 847 from the
field through Major Command (MAJCOM) publications/forms managers. Ensure all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records     Disposition      Schedule     (RDS)     located    at    https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
f61a/afrims/afrims/ . The use of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial
product, commodity or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force.

1. Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) Project Officer.
   1.1. The 452 MXG/CC will appoint a primary and alternate ASIP/IATP project officer from
   within the 452d Maintenance Group (MXG).
 2                                                     452AMWI21-105 25 SEPTEMBER 2013


        1.1.1. The ASIP/IATP project officers will also serve as the ASIP/IATP monitors.
2. The ASIP/IATP Project Officer will: Develop and maintain a system to file notifications
from the Aircraft Structural Integrity Management Information System (ASIMIS) website
showing the files were uploaded to verify compliance.
3. Individual Aircraft Tracking Program (IATP).
     3.1. The KC-135 and C-17 IATP programs were developed to monitor the aircrafts’
     structural integrity. The computer programs calculate the safe life expectancy of different
     aircraft structural components. The end products of the IATP aid in evaluating airframe
     service life, as well as facilitating decisions concerning aircraft inspection and maintenance
     modification. The IATP is also used to calculate service usage on individual aircraft based on
     damage and accrued wear.
4. Storage Media.
     4.1. 452 AMW KC-135R aircraft storage media for ASIP data is the Flight Data Recorder
     and Cockpit Voice Recorder (FDR/CVR) records and stores individual aircraft usage data.
        4.1.1. Data is downloaded and transferred using Personal Computer Memory Card
        International Association (PCMCIA). PCMCIA cards will be controlled using TC-Max.
     4.2. 452 AMW C-17A aircraft storage media for ASIP data is the Standard Flight Data
     Recorder (SFDR).
5. Deployed Procedures.
     5.1. Units will comply with the same procedures in this instruction while deployed.
6. ASIP Training Requirements.
     6.1. Individual users of Aircraft Data Acquisition and Distribution System (ADADS) and
     ASIMIS will receive cascade training from individuals qualified to make inputs into the
     system. Training will consist of On the Job Training (OJT) and will be documented on an AF
     IMT 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation, or other appropriate means.
7. KC-135R Responsibilities.
     7.1. Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS):
        7.1.1. AMXS personnel shall be responsible to maintain and repair and will download
        FDR/CVR data after each flight and as otherwise required in TO 1C-135-6WC-1. They
        will also transfer the data into the ADADS.
     7.2. Engine Manager:
        7.2.1. The Engine manager shall be responsible for ensuring each flight has been loaded
        and that the data is valid for transfer to the Comprehensive Engine Trending and
        Diagnostic System (CETADS).
8. C-17 Responsibilities.
     8.1. The Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) will download data from the aircraft’s
     SFDR to a laptop computer that is configured with the ADADS Program. Data is then
     uploaded to the ASIMIS website that calculates the safe life expectancy of different aircraft
     structural components; it is therefore imperative that maintenance technicians accurately

  capture and upload the recorded data from the SFDR. The ASIP/IATP project officer is
  responsible to ensure data is uploaded to the ASIMIS website located at Tinker Air Force
  Base, Oklahoma, https://asimisweb.tinker.af.mil.
  8.2. Frequency of SFDR downloads.
     8.2.1. Accomplished every HSC.
     8.2.2. Accomplished within 10 flying hours of hard landing.
     8.2.3. Accomplished for severe turbulence inspection.
     8.2.4. Accomplished for over G maneuver outside of the design flight envelope.
     8.2.5. Accomplished when aircraft exceeds 195,000 pounds vertical load on landing or
     taxi.
     8.2.6. Accomplished when “FDR MEMORY 80% FULL” is displayed on the
     maintenance monitor panel.
     8.2.7. Accomplished when “FDR SPECIAL EVENT” is displayed on the maintenance
     monitor panel.
     8.2.8. Accomplished when “WCC-LFPFFDR80” is displayed on non-avionics fault list.
     8.2.9. Accomplished when “WCC-FDRSPEVT” is displayed on non-avionics fault list.
