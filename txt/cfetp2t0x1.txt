Part I

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and
training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support
resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide
personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.
NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position
qualification training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts; both parts of the plan are used by supervisors to plan,
manage, and control training within the career field.
2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A
explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information,
duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each
level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other); Section D indicates
resource constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, facilities; Section E
identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.
2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS)
and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training
Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, core task, and correspondence course
requirements; Section B is reserved in this CFETP; Section C identifies available support
materials. An example is a Qualification Training Package (QTPs which may be developed to
support proficiency training). These packages are identified in the Air Force Master Catalog;
Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to
support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses; Section E identifies
MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training
required for the associated qualification needs.

3. Guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and
efficient training at the appropriate point in their careers. This plan will enable us to train today's
work force for tomorrow's jobs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify,
plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

Section A - General Information

1. Purpose. This CFETP provides information necessary for Air Force Career Field Managers
(AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors
and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program. This
plan outlines the training individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress
throughout their careers. This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and
proficiency training. Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon
entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.
Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers. Upgrade
training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence
course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-skill levels. Qualification training is
actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty
position. This training occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to
provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job. Advanced training is formal
specialty training used for selected airmen. Proficiency training is additional training, either in-
residence or using exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to
personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The
CFETP has several uses, some are:
1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training
program. It is also used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an
individual's career.
1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and
recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.
1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training
delivery method.
1.4. Identifies major resource constraints which impact full implementation of the desired career
field training process.

2. Use of the CFEPT. MFMs and supervisors will use this plan at all levels to ensure
comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.
2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field and
exportable training courses based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part
II of the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for
obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.
2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial,
upgrade, and proficiency requirements. Identified requirements can be satisfied using OJT,
resident training, contract training, or exportable training courses. MAJCOM-developed training
to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into plan.
2.3. Each trainee will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The
list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference for additional training.

3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority. MAJCOM
representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field
training requirements. The AETC training manager for this specialty will initiate an annual review
of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure requirements are current and accurate. Using the
list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

Part II

Section A - Specialty Training Standard

1. Implementation.
1.1. Specialty Training Standard 2T031/2T051 Traffic Management Apprentice/Traffic
Management Journeyman will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes
beginning 051003 graduating 051220.
1.2. Specialty Training Standard 2T071 Traffic Management Craftsman will be used for technical
training provided by AETC for classes beginning February 2006.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, volume 5,this STS:
2.1. Lists in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical References) spell out the most common
tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airman to perform duties in the
3-, 5-, and 7-skill level of the Traffic Management ladder of the Transportation Career Field.
These tasks and knowledge items are based on an analysis of the duties and responsibilities
contained in AFMAN 36-2108. Wartime tasks are identified by an "*" in the far left of column 1.
2.2. Column 2 (Core Tasks) represent mandatory specialty-wide training requirements. Core
Tasks are identified by an "*" in the proper skill level column(A-3, B-5 or C- 7). Refer to AFI 36-
2201 vol. 3 for more details on core tasks. Completion of non-mandatory tasks, tasks not
identified which are pertinent to the unit, will be accomplished as tasks become available for
training.
2.3. Column 3 (Certification for OJT) provides certification for OJT, it is used to record the status
of tasks and knowledge training requirements. Use the Master Task List for the current unit to
circle the appropriate items. Tasks and knowledge items status documentation must show a start
date, completion date, trainee/trainer and certifier initials (when required). Use automated training
management systems to document technician qualifications, if available. Refer to AFI 36-2201
vol. 3 for more details on proper training documentation.
2.4. Column 4 (Proficiency codes....) shows formal training and correspondence course
requirements. It shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of
training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.
See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit training manager for current CDC listings.
2.5. Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate
the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.
2.6. This STS becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in
AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder, and used according to AFI 36-2201, Volume
3. When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:
2.6.1. Documentation. For documentation and transcribing procedures, see AFI 36-2201,
volume 3.
2.6.1.1. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available: the supervisor
identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, as a
minimum, that trainees cover the mandatory items in AFMAN 36-2108. For two-time CDC
course exam failures: supervisors identify all STS items corresponding to the areas covered by the
CDC. The trainee completes a study of STS references, undergoes evaluation by the task certifier,
and receives certification on the STS. NOTE: Career Knowledge must be documented prior to
submitting a CDC waiver.

ATTACHMENT 2, STS 2T031/2T051/2T071




2.6.1.2. Decertification and Recertification. When an airman is found to be unqualified on a
task previously certified for his or her position, the supervisor lines through the previous
certification or deletes previous certification when using automated system. Appropriate remarks
are entered on the AF Form 623A, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to the
reason for decertification. The individual is recertified (if required) either by erasing the old
entries and writing in the new or by using correction fluid (if the entries were made in ink) over the
previously certified entry.
2.6.2. Training Standard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. Go means the
individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy,
timeliness, and correct use of procedures.
2.7. Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion
System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF Occupational
Measurement Squadron by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.
The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team
members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study
references listed in the WAPS catalog. Individual responsibilities are in chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605,
Air Force Military Personnel Testing System. WAPS is not applicable to the Air Force Reserves
and Air National Guard.

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.
(Example: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a
subject common to several tasks.

- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.

X This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.

 NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items identified by "*" in column 1 are trained during war time.
