                                            Chapter 1

                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. Introduction. In an effort to meet the growing needs of today’s war fighter, great strides
are being made to improve the capabilities offered by the Air Force provisioned portion of the
Global Information Grid (GIG). Today’s Air Force is increasingly using these capabilities in
almost all activities of warfighting and operations support. This increased reliance on
technology and its integration requires each individual to take responsibility for ensuring
effective, efficient, and authorized use of these resources as they carry out their responsibilities.
1.2. Applicability. This publication applies to all Air Force Information Systems (ISs) and
devices, including stand-alone ISs, IS components of weapon systems where Platform
Information Technology (PIT) interconnections exist, ISs connected to external networks via
authorized Internet Service Providers, ISs that provide the management infrastructure, and
connections among other ISs and ISs used to process, store, display, transmit, or protect Air
Force information, regardless of classification or sensitivity.
   1.2.1. This publication is binding on all authorized users to include military, civilian,
   contractor, temporary employees, volunteers, and interns who are authorized to operate the
   ISs owned, maintained, and controlled by the Air Force.
   1.2.2. More restrictive Federal, DOD, and Office of the Director of National Intelligence
   directive requirements governing non-Air Force space, Special Access Programs
   (SAP)/Special Access Requirements (SAR), and Intelligence information take precedence
   over this publication.
1.3. Objective. The objective of this publication is to ensure users understand how to protect
and secure United States (US) government information processed by Air Force ISs with the
assistance of their applicable organizational IA workforce personnel (e.g., organizational
Information Assurance Officers [IAOs], Client System Technicians [CSTs]). This publication
identifies policies and procedures for the use of cyberspace support systems/services and
compliance requirements of Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of Warfighting Integration and
Chief Information Officer (SAF/CIO A6) managed programs.
1.4. Assistance. Users contact the organizational IAO for clarification on any Information
System requirements outlined within this publication.
1.5. Waiver Authority. AF/A3CP/A6CP is the waiver authority for the provisions in this
manual. Waiver requests shall contain compelling justification and must be submitted via
emailto AF/A3CP/A6CP.

                                            Chapter 2

                  INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND END USER DEVICES

2.1. Overview. Information systems are a set of information resources. End user devices
include ISs such as desktop PCs, laptops, notebooks, tablets, smartphones, executive mobile
devices, etc. as used by users. Access control is one of the measures taken to ensure ISs are
protected against threats and vulnerabilities. This chapter provides user responsibilities for ISs
including end user devices whereas AFMAN 33-282, Computer Security provides policies for all
Air Force ISs including IAO responsibilities for ISs.
2.2. Training Requirement. All IS users will complete DOD IA training prior to granting
access to an IS according to DOD 8570.01-M, IA Workforce Improvement Program.
     2.2.1. Users reaccomplish IA training annually using the Advanced Distributed Learning
     System (ADLS) computer based training which reports compliance to the IAO.
     2.2.2. When a user requires a new account or modification to an existing account (due to
     change of station or assignment, Temporary Duty [TDY], etc.), users are not required to
     retake the DOD IA training provided the user has a valid and current (within a year) course
     completion record.
2.3. Information System Access. Access to an Air Force IS is a privilege and continued access
is contingent on personal conduct, personnel actions, changes in need to know, or operational
necessity. Users request IS access and specific authorizations within the system through the
organization or system IAO using the DD Form 2875, System Authorization Access Request
(SAAR). DD Form 2875 signatures may be handwritten or digital. Contact the organization or
system IAO for identification and authentication guidance and see AFMAN 33-282, Computer
Security. See paragraph 2.14 for wireless mobile device requirements.
     2.3.1. All authorized IS users will sign the standardized AF Form 4394, Air Force User
     Agreement Statement-Notice and Consent Provision prior to initial IS access and submit to
     the organization IAO with a handwritten or digital signature. Only one AF Form 4394 is
     required per user as maintained by the organization IAO regardless of the number of system
     access requests inside or outside the organization.
     2.3.2. Access to classified ISs also requires a Standard Form 312, Nondisclosure Agreement,
     according to AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.
     2.3.3. Users may transport or email their user agreement (AF 4394) upon permanent change
     of station and present it to the gaining organization IAO at in-processing. Wireless Mobile
     Device user agreements must be reaccomplished due to new authorizing/issuing personnel.
     2.3.4. Each user is responsible and accountable for their password/Personal Identification
     Number (PIN).
     2.3.5. Users must protect all passwords and PINs based on the sensitivity of the information
     or critical operations they protect (e.g., a password used to gain access to a SECRET network
     is itself classified SECRET). Follow all CAC individual responsibilities according to AFI
     36-3026_IP, Volume 1, Identification Cards for Members of the Uniformed Services, Their
     Eligible Family Members, and Other Eligible Personnel.
AFMAN33-152 1 JUNE 2012                                                                            7


   2.3.6. Interim system access may be granted for less than 5 duty days if system access is
   required to complete electronic versions of DD Form 2875 and/or AF Form 4394.
   2.3.7. DoD Visitor access allows any user with a DoD Common Access Card (CAC)
   temporary access on any supported computer when they are away from their normal duty
   station. This allows for limited access to the basic capabilities of the computer to enable
   access to available enterprise capabilities. Full access and privileges to additional capabilities
   requires a request for IS access.
2.4. Loss of Access. User’s conduct that is inconsistent with IA policies and guidelines may
result in immediate suspension of access to unclassified and classified ISs.
   2.4.1. Supervisors follow the guidance in AFMAN 33-282, Computer Security for
   suspension actions once a violation is confirmed. Violations of IA policies and guidelines
   include, but are not limited to:
       2.4.1.1. Unauthorized use of the network.
       2.4.1.2. Failure to maintain annual DOD IA awareness training.
       2.4.1.3. Actions that threaten the security of a network or a governmental

      Comply with local policies, on or off-base.
   4.5.4. Personal Use of CT Service.
      4.5.4.1. The same rules that govern use of land line telephones apply to the use of Air
      Force CTs. Reference paragraph 4.9. for official and authorized purposes.
      4.5.4.2. Members making inappropriate CT calls, text messages, or emails are subject to
      disciplinary action even if the usage does not cause additional expense. Failure to
      observe the prohibitions and mandatory provisions of paragraph 4.5.4.2.1 by
      military personnel is a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ),
      Article 92, Failure to Obey Order or Regulation. Violations by civilian employees
      may result in administrative disciplinary action without regard to otherwise
      applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws. Violations by
      contactor personnel will be handled according to local laws and the terms of the
      contract.
AFMAN33-152 1 JUNE 2012                                                                         17


          4.5.4.2.1. Do not use Air Force issued CTs to conduct personal commercial
          activities. Some examples of inappropriate calls include those related to personal
          solicitation or sales matters and those of a harassing or obscene nature. If a caller has
          any questions concerning proper use of government cell phones, it is the caller’s
          responsibility to check with a supervisor before making the call.
       4.5.4.3. Dual line CTs. Individuals may elect at their option to activate the secondary
       line as a personal number and place personal calls on that line.
          4.5.4.3.1. Activation of a dual-number capability is not permitted on secure CTs.
          4.5.4.3.2. Authorized end user of a government-owned, dual-number capable CT:
              4.5.4.3.2.1. Shall sign an agreement, produced in accordance with Base Judge
              Advocate and Contracting office guidance, that contains appropriate ―hold
              harmless‖ and ―personal liability‖ clauses, prior to being issued a dual-number
              capable CT, without regard to whether or not the user elects to immediately
              activate the secondary number capability.
              4.5.4.3.2.2. Must ensure all bills associated with the personal account are mailed
              directly to the user’s home address or post office box if a secondary number is
              activated.
              4.5.4.3.2.3. Shall ensure that the personal account is closed and the secondary
              number zeroized by the vendor prior to returning the CT to the local Personal
              Wireless Communications System (PWCS) manager for reuse when a CT is no
              longer required for the performance of duties.
4.6. Official Telephone Service in Personal Quarters is permitted for certain officials when
necessary for national defense purposes. Contact your organizational TCO for more
information. Specific policy and procedures are contained in AFI 33-111, Voice Systems
Management.
4.7. Unofficial Commercial Telephone/Voice Service In Quarters.
   4.7.1. The individual subscriber must pay for renting, acquiring, and maintaining end-user
   instruments, as well as all usage charges for personal telephone service.
   4.7.2. If required by the housing manager, housing occupants must restore telephone wiring
   and outlets to the original configuration before clearing quarters.
4.8. Air Force Instruction on Defense Switched Network (DSN) On- or Off-Net Calling.
   4.8.1. Authorized Actions:
       4.8.1.1. Placing an official call to a DSN operator (base operator) from a commercial
       network and having the operator extend the call over DSN to a DSN number (on-netting).
       4.8.1.2. Placing an official call to a DSN operator from a DSN number and having the
       operator extend the call to a local commercial number (off-netting).
          4.8.1.2.1. The installation CSO determines local guidance on the off-netting of an
          official DSN call to an official long-distance toll number. The installation CSO is
          directly responsible for toll charges and determines billing procedures, recourse for
 18                                                               AFMAN33-152 1 JUNE 2012


          reimbursement, and/or acceptable appropriated fund support for off-netting official
          installation toll calls.
4.9. Health, Morale, and Welfare (HMW) Calls.
   4.9.1. HMW calls are authorized over the DSN as prescribed in Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
   of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6215.01C, Policy for Department of Defense Voice Networks
   with Real Time Services (RTS). HMW calls are not authorized on government-issued CT, or
   via the FTS-2001 (or its designated replacement) network. However, satellite phones may be
   approved for HMW calls by the Organizational Commander on a case-by-case basis. You
   can obtain copies of CJCS publications at http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/index.html.
      4.9.1.1. HMW calls are intended for military and Department of the Air Force civilians.
      HMW calls are authorized when:
          4.9.1.1.1. In an unaccompanied status at overseas or remote geographic locations.
          4.9.1.1.2. Single at overseas or remote geographic locations.
          4.9.1.1.3. Performing temporary duty (TDY).
      4.9.1.2. Immediate family members or the parents of single active duty personnel and/or
      the guardian of the child of a single parent or military/military couple, both of whom are
      deployed, may be permitted to participate in the HMW program under procedures
      established by the Airman and Family Readiness Center (i.e., as part of ―Hearts Apart‖ or
      similar programs) and the host commander. It is both the deployed commander and the
      host base commander’s responsibility to provide guidance on the limitations and
      opportunities made available by this program.
      4.9.1.3. The primary method for placing HMW calls is Automated Health and Morale
      System (AHAMS). AHAMS eliminates the need for base operator involvement and
      automatically controls time limits. If AHAMS is not available then place DSN HMW
      calls at routine precedence, normally not to exceed 15 minutes.
      4.9.1.4. DSN HMW calls should not exceed a reasonable frequency as designated by the
      installation commander in conjunction with the installation CSO. Reasonable frequency
      is based upon installation/theater policy and determined by system capabilities, mission
      needs and restrictions. EXCEPTION: Emergency calls may exceed the established
      threshold.
      4.9.1.5. Extending DSN HMW calls to a commercial number (off-netting) is authorized,
      provided it does not interfere with operational requirements. Off-net DSN HMW calls
      will not incur a toll charge to the government even if the intent is to reimburse the
      government. If the call incurs a toll charge, base operators may extend the call if the
      caller uses a credit/calling card to charge the call or the called party agrees to accept the
      charges (e.g., reversing of charges). See paragraph 4.8.1.2 for definition of off-netting.
      4.9.1.6. On-netting of DSN HMW calls is permissible when placed from within the
      Continental United States (CONUS) as part of Airman and Family Readiness ―Hearts
      Apart‖ or other similar programs. See paragraph 4.8.1.1. for definition of on-netting.
4.10. Official Government Issued Calling Card Use.
AFMAN33-152 1 JUNE 2012                                                                  19


  4.10.1. Government issued calling cards are issued for official use only. Cardholders must
  not use the calling card for any purpose other than official use. Failure to observe the
  prohibitions and mandatory provisions of this paragraph by military personnel is a
  violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), Article 92, Failure to Obey
  Order or Regulation. Violations by civilian employees may result in administrative
  disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions for
  violations of related laws. Violations by contactor personnel will be handled according
  to local laws and the terms of the contract.
  4.10.2. Cardholders must sign a statement acknowledging receiving the government issued
  calling card and that the card is for official use only.

                                           Chapter 5

                                RECORDS MANAGEMENT

5.1. Records Management. Records management will be established as applicable for Air
Force External Official Presence and for Air Force-wide, -operated, or –controlled publically
accessible Internet sites. All uses must comply with AFI 33-322, AFI 33-332, AFI 33-364, and
AFMAN 33-363. Records play a vital role in managing and operating Air Force activities. In
simple terms, records document official business, serve as the memory of the organization, a
record of past events, and are the basis for future actions. Every Air Force activity must manage
its records to comply with legal accountability requirements. The key to an effective records
management program is the integrity of the filing system--a system that ensures a standard
methodology for filing, storing, discovering, retrieving, and ultimately disposing of records
according to published retention and disposition schedules. Discovery of records must be
facilitated by the creator of the information asset by assuring that metadata describing the
information is captured or generated. AFMAN 33-363 establishes the requirement to use the Air
Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS); establishes guidelines for managing
all records (regardless of media); and defines methods and the format for record storage, file
procedures, converting paper records to other media or vice versa, and outlines the minimum to
comply with records management legal and policy requirements.
   5.1.1. All personnel:
       5.1.1.1. Will receive annual government records management and PII training.
       5.1.1.2. Must not conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate or destroy government records
       without proper authority. Unauthorized concealment, removal, mutilation, obliteration or
       destruction of records, or any attempt to do so, may be a violation of Title 18, U.S.C.,
       Section 2071 and may be punished by up to three years confinement and a fine.
       Violations by military personnel are a violation of the Uniform Code of Military
       Justice (UCMJ), Article 92, Failure to Obey Order or Regulation. Violations by
       civilian employees may result in administrative disciplinary action without regard to
       otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws.
       Violations by contactor personnel will be handled according to local laws and the
       terms of the contract.
       5.1.1.3. Must inform officials of any actual or potential unlawful removal, change, or
       destruction of Air Force records.
       5.1.1.4. Must distinguish government records from non-record materials and maintain
       personal papers separately. Contact your Records Custodian for assistance.
       5.1.1.5. Be aware of the periodic expiration of certificates if encryption is used or if
       encrypted electronic messages are received. Expiration is currently every 3 years or
       earlier based on expiration of individual employment. Recommend users store electronic
       messages in the unencrypted form or plan to de-encrypt encrypted electronic messages
       prior to expiration of encryption certificate. Otherwise, when the encryption certificate is
       needed the user has to go through the key recovery process (through the appropriate ESD
       or CST Help Desk) to gain the necessary keys to access encrypted electronic messages.
AFMAN33-152 1 JUNE 2012                                                                      21


5.2. Records Authentication. The process used to ascertain the identity of a person or the
integrity of specific record information. A record is authenticated when it contains an official
signature or seal indicating the document is genuine and official. A signature or seal may be
written, stamped, electronic or digital. Reference AFI 33-321.

                                            Chapter 6

                                ELECTRONIC MESSAGING

6.1. General. All government communications systems are subject to monitoring, interception,
search, and seizure for all authorized purposes, reference DOD Chief Information Officer (CIO)
Memorandum, Policy on Use of Department of Defense (DOD) Information Systems Standard
Consent Banner and User Agreement. Government-provided messaging systems are for official
use and limited authorized personal use only. (See Chapter 3.)
   6.1.1. AFMAN 33-363 defines official records and electronic records. DOD 5400.7-
   R_AFMAN 33-302, Freedom of Information Act Program; and AFI 33-332, Air Force
   Privacy Program, describe when electronic messages are subject to the requirements of the
   Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act of 1974.
   6.1.2. Barring absence of official communication channels, do not use personal accounts to
   conduct official AF communication. Conduct personal communication in compliance with
   DOD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER).
       6.1.2.1. Avoid the dissemination and discussion of non-public information and disclaim
       opinions as necessary in accordance with DOD 5500.7-R.
       6.1.2.2. Exercise vigilance to ensure that both sensitive and classified information are not
       inadvertently disclosed, and that the disclosure of unclassified information, in aggregate,
       does not reveal sensitive or classified information.
6.2. Air Force Messaging.
   6.2.1. Electronic messaging (including email and instant messaging) users will:
       6.2.1.1. Maintain responsibility for the content of their electronic messages and ensure
       that messages sent adhere to acceptable use of Internet-based capabilities (Chapter 3).
       6.2.1.2. Maintain sent and received information according to Air Force records
       management directives: AFMAN 33-363; AFI 33-322, Records Management Program;
       and AFRIMS RDS (https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm). Emails
       may be subject to requests under the FOIA, litigation, and court orders. If requested,
       individuals are responsible for reviewing messages in email accounts and all backups to
       locate responsive material.
       6.2.1.3. Adhere to local policy on sending electronic messages to a large number of
       recipients. Digital images, as well as mass distribution of smaller messages, may delay
       other traffic, overload the system, and subsequently cause system failure.
       6.2.1.4. Adhere to local policy when sending an electronic message to mail distribution
       lists. Use web pages or electronic public folders for unofficial electronic messages (i.e.,
       booster club activities, etc.).
       6.2.1.5. Only reply to electronic messages that absolutely require a response and
       minimize the use of the ―Reply to All‖ function.
       6.2.1.6. Bear sole responsibility for material sent.
       6.2.1.7. Properly coordinate and staff electronic messages according to local directives.
AFMAN33-152 1 JUNE 2012                                                                        23


       6.2.1.8. Take appropriate action on non-delivery notices or message rejects to ensure
       messages reach the intended recipient.
       6.2.1.9. Not auto-forward electronic messages from the ―.mil‖ domain to a commercial
       Internet Service Provider (ISP).
       6.2.1.10. Not indiscriminately release electronic messaging addresses to the public. For
       further information, reference the Air Force Freedom of Information Act ―Release of
       Email Addresses‖ (http://ww.foia.af.mil).
   6.2.2. Individual electronic messages are considered official when the sender is conducting
   mission-related or official business.
   6.2.3. Special delivery instructions should be included as part of the message text to identify
   the specific addressee to whom the message is to be delivered.
   6.2.4. Messages with special delivery instructions should not be distributed through normal
   delivery channels unless specifically requested by the recipient.
   6.2.5. Special Handling Requirements. Do not transmit controlled unclassified information
   (i.e. Privacy Act, FOUO) on or to systems not approved for that information. Reference AFI
   31-401.
       6.2.5.1. Transmitting unclassified information on classified networks is authorized unless
       specifically prohibited by the network operating instructions. Follow AFI 31-401,
       Information Security Program Management, marking guidance for unclassified electronic
       messages sent across a classified network.
       6.2.5.2. Identify all Privacy Act and For Official Use Only (FOUO) electronic messages
       in the subject line with FOUO.
6.3. Use of Subscription Services. Internet electronic messaging access grants users the ability
to subscribe to a variety of news, mail lists, and discussion groups. These services may include
professional groups sponsored by Air Force agencies and other newsgroups sponsored by non-
Air Force agencies, including the DOD, other Federal agencies, educational institutions, and
commercial activities (i.e., product information updates and technical newsletters).
   6.3.1. When an extended absence will not allow access to your electronic messaging
   account, unsubscribe or suspend mail from any mail lists or newsgroups. This alleviates
   large backlogs of received messages that consume server storage resources.
   6.3.2. Participation in newsgroups whose content is contrary to the standards set by DOD
   5500.7-R (i.e., obscene, offensive, etc.) is prohibited. (See Chapter 3.) Organizational
   commanders may direct electronic messaging administrators to set up permanent blocks on a
   specific site or newsgroup addresses to prevent subscription to such services.
6.4. Electronic Message Format.
   6.4.1. Electronic messages, to include official communications such as memorandums
   (letters), notes, messages, reports, etc., follow specific formats found in Air Force Handbook
   (AFH) 33-337, The Tongue and Quill, AFI 33-321, Authentication of Air Force Records, and
   AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official Communications.
 24                                                              AFMAN33-152 1 JUNE 2012

   individual or organizational accounts. Examples of appropriate signature blocks are in AFH
   33-337, The Tongue and Quill.
      6.4.2.1. Include ―//SIGNED//‖ in upper case before the signature block to signify official
      Air Force information (e.g., instructions, directions, or policies).
      6.4.2.2. Restrict the signature block to name, rank, service affiliation, duty title,
      organization name, phone numbers (DSN and/or commercial as appropriate), and social
      media contact information.
      6.4.2.3. Do not add slogans, quotes, or other personalization to an official signature
      block.
   6.4.3. When a member (military, civilian, or contractor) has another official position (i.e.,
   civilian is a Reservist/Guardsman; contractor is a Reservist/Guardsman or vice versa), the
   member will be provided two email accounts in order to separate the member’s email for
   each function. Signature blocks will explicitly follow the guidance in paragraph 6.4.2. to
   distinguish between the different official positions performed by a single member. Exception:
   Air Reserve Technicians may use their military accounts.
   6.4.4. Naming conventions for messaging systems are covered in TO 00-33D-2001-WA-1,
   Active Directory Naming Conventions.
6.5. Protection and Disposition of Electronic Message Information.
   6.5.1. Controlled Unclassified Messages. There is information, other than classified
   information, that has been determined to require some type of protection or control.
      6.5.1.1. Encrypt electronic messages whenever practical when they contain controlled
      unclassified information, (i.e. Privacy Act, FOUO). See Chapter 2 for further information
      on encryption. See AFI 31-401 for additional guidance on controlled unclassified
      information.
      6.5.1.2. Protecting FOUO Information. When transmitting FOUO information, add
      ―FOUO‖ to the beginning of the subject line, followed by the subject. FOUO
      attachments shall be marked with a statement similar to this one: ―FOR OFFICIAL USE
      ONLY ATTACHMENT.‖ Additional protection methods may include password
      protecting the information in a separate portable document format supporting password
      protection. See AFI 31-401 for additional guidance on protecting FOUO information.
      6.5.1.3. Protecting Personal Information. Transmitting personal information exempt
      from public release under the Freedom of Information Act must be marked ―FOUO‖ at
      the beginning of the subject line IAW guidance contained in AFI 33-332, AFI 31-401 and
      DOD Manual 5200.01, V1, DoD Information Security Program: Overview,
      Classification, and Declassification.
          6.5.1.3.1. Apply the following statement at the beginning of the message: ―The
          information herein is For Official Use Only (FOUO) which must be protected under
          the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. Unauthorized disclosure or misuse of this
          PERSONAL INFORMATION may result in criminal and/or civil penalties.‖

          6.5.1.3.2. Do not indiscriminately apply this statement to messages that are not
          publically releasable. Use it only in situations when you are actually transmitting
          personal information. Personal information may not be disclosed to anyone outside
          DOD unless specifically authorized by The Privacy Act.
          6.5.1.3.3. Do not send Privacy Act information to distribution lists or group email
          addresses unless each member has an official need to know for the personal
          information.
      6.5.1.4. Protecting Exempt Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Information, Title 5,
      U.S.C., Section 552. Do not send FOIA information normally exempt in electronic
      messages without an appropriate level of protection to prevent unintentional or
      unauthorized disclosure. Refer to AFI 31-401 and DOD Manual 5200.01, V1 for
      additional guidance or consult your local FOIA representative. Appropriate level of
      protection includes proper marking and encryption.
   6.5.2. Classified Electronic Messages.
      6.5.2.1. Marking Classified Electronic Messages. Mark all classified electronic
      messages with a level of classification equivalent to the information they contain or
      reveal in accordance with AFI 31-401, DOD Manual 5200.01, V1, and Controlled Access
      Program Coordination Office (CAPCO) Register and Manual.
      6.5.2.2. Message Declassification. Classified messages must contain declassification or
      downgrading instructions at the end of the message text. See AFI 31-401 for additional
      guidance.
      6.5.2.3. Classified Electronic Message Destruction.
          6.5.2.3.1. Destroy classified messages when no longer required. If the classified
          message is an official record, destroy it only after the retention period in AFRIMS
          RDS has expired.
          6.5.2.3.2. TOP SECRET Control Officers use AF Form 143, TOP SECRET Register
          Page, or another approved form (e.g., AF Form 310, Document Receipt and
          Destruction Certificate) to record the destruction of TOP SECRET electronic
          messages.
          6.5.2.3.3. When you must keep a record of destroyed SECRET and
          CONFIDENTIAL materials, use AF Form 310 or AF Form 1565, Entry, Receipt and

6.6. Digitally Signing and Encrypting Electronic Messages.
 26                                                                AFMAN33-152 1 JUNE 2012


   6.6.1. Digitally Signing. Use PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) CAC digital signature
   certificates whenever it is necessary for the recipient of an electronic message to be assured
   of the sender's identity (non-repudiation) or have confidence the message has not been
   modified. Messages containing only unofficial information and not containing an embedded
   hyperlink and/or attachment are not required to be digitally signed. Refer to guidance in AFI
   33-321 regarding email authentication. Contact your IAO for assistance. Examples of
   messages that should be digitally signed include:
       6.6.1.1. Formal direction to a government employee or contractor.
       6.6.1.2. Messages that stipulate an Air Force official position on any matter.
       6.6.1.3. Messages that commit to, authorize, or deny the use of funds in some manner.
       6.6.1.4. Emails from user accounts and systems which contain an embedded hyperlink
       and/or attachment. Plain-text references to URL's do not require digital signature but
       they are recommended.
   6.6.2. Encrypting. DOD PKI-based encryption is not authorized for protecting classified
   information on systems not approved for that use. Encryption increases bandwidth and
   resource requirements; therefore, email encryption should be used to protect the following
   types of information, and the number of email recipients should be kept to a minimum:
       6.6.2.1. For Official Use Only (FOUO).
       6.6.2.2. Privacy Act Information. For additional guidance see AFI 33-332.
       6.6.2.3. Personally Identifiable Information (PII), (see Terms, Attachment 1).
       6.6.2.4. Individually identifiable health, DOD payroll, finance, logistics, personnel
       management, proprietary, and foreign government information.
       6.6.2.5. Contract data.
       6.6.2.6. Export controlled technical data or information.
       6.6.2.7. Operations Security (OPSEC) information. Encrypt critical information, OPSEC
       indicators, and other sources of information. For additional guidance on OPSEC
       requirements see AFI 10-701, Operations Security.
       6.6.2.8. Information specified for encryption by domain owners pertaining to your
       individual areas of responsibility, see AFPD 33-4, Enterprise Architecting.
6.7. Message Forwarding (Manual and Automated). All previously stated guidance also
applies to forwarded electronic messages. If the message was originally encrypted, it should not
be forwarded outside the organization without being encrypted again whenever practical. See
paragraph 5.4.2.1. for further information on marking classified electronic messages.
   6.7.1. Automated Message Forwarding.
       6.7.1.1. Be aware that each message is automatically unsigned/unencrypted and
       distributed based on profiles loaded in the automated message distribution or profiling
       system.
       6.7.1.2. Do not auto-forward official electronic messages to commercial Internet Service
       Providers (ISPs) from government computer systems.
AFMAN33-152 1 JUNE 2012                                                                         27


       6.7.1.3. Do not create automated message forwarding rules or procedures to send
       electronic messages to pagers, cell phones, commercial/non-military accounts.
6.8. Message Management. Electronic messages that are considered Air Force records IAW
AFMAN 33-363 must be managed, stored, and deleted from the message system after copying to
a record keeping system. If a digitally signed and/or encrypted official record is to be preserved,
the user must follow procedures outlined in AFI 33-322, Records Management Program. These
procedures will ensure the information necessary to validate the digital signature is retained and
the record is always accessible.
   6.8.1. Use backup media of messages for security, system restoration and short-term
   archiving of official record email not to exceed 120 days.
   6.8.2. Users are required to retain official record emails by filing in an approved electronic
   record keeping system. If an approved electronic record keeping system is not available,
   users will print the official record emails to paper copy and file.
       6.8.2.1. Management of both official and individual messages is determined by the Chief
       of an Office of Record and is based upon the message originator’s authentication
       authority.
       6.8.2.2. In determining whether a message is a record or not, focus on the content of the
       information and not on the method used to send it. If the content of the message would
       have been filed if it had been created on paper, then the message should also be filed or
       archived. Encrypted messages will be decrypted prior to electronically filing or archiving.
       In some cases an individual message may become background information to the final
       decision or recommendation. In other cases the message may be managed in a suspense
       document until all comments are received and incorporated into a final document, then
       filed under the appropriate table and rule in Air Force RDS.
       6.8.2.3. Preserve the content, context, and structure of records in a useable format for
       their authorized retention period. A complete electronic messaging record will include
       the message itself, attachments (e.g., word processing and other electronic documents
       transmitted with the message), and transmission data (e.g., originator, recipients,
       addresses, date, and time).
       6.8.2.4. Make records easily accessible by individuals who have an official need to
       access them.
       6.8.2.5. Arrange electronic message records according to the approved file plan.
       6.8.2.6. Ensure federal records sent or received on electronic messaging systems outside
       organizational control are preserved. Ensure reasonable steps are taken to capture
       available transmission and receipt data needed by the agency for record-keeping
       purposes.
6.9. Organizational Messaging. Organization SMTP mailboxes may be used for all
organizational messaging requirements unless usage of DMS is required in support of combatant
command responsibilities of CJCSI 5721.01E, The Defense Message System and Associated
Legacy Message Processing Systems.
   6.9.1. Each office will designate an individual to monitor the organization mailboxes
   regularly to ensure messages requiring action are promptly acted upon, to include electronic
28                                                              AFMAN33-152 1 JUNE 2012


  filing and/or destruction, as defined in the organizational file plan and associated table and
  rule.
  6.9.2. Each individual should have a unique identifier that the system can authenticate and
  provide an audit trail. When email systems cannot provide a unique identifier for actions
  with the organization mailboxes, local administrative procedures will provide the audit trail.
  6.9.3. To assist with providing an audit trail for email users, personnel who send on behalf of
  the owner of an organizational account will send a copy of all email as ―Cc‖ to the
  organizational mailbox.
