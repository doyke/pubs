This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-2, Law Enforcement. It
assigns responsibilities and establishes procedures for motor vehicle traffic supervision on Air
Force installations in the continental United States (CONUS) and overseas (OCONUS) areas.
This includes, but is not limited to, granting, suspending, or revoking the privilege to operate a
privately owned vehicle (POV); registration of POVs; administration of vehicle registration and
driver performance records; driver improvement programs; police traffic supervision; and off-
installation traffic activities.

This interim change eliminates the requirement for privately owed vehicles to be registered with
the Air Force or other DoD agency to be operated on an Air Force installation. The IC re-titles
Chapter 3 from “Motor Vehicle Registration” to “Privately Owned Vehicle Operation
Requirements.” A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition.

   with the CSP and installation safety officer. They ensure traffic signs, signals, and pavement
   markings conform to the standards in the current Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
   for Streets and Highways. They also ensure planning, design, construction, and maintenance
   of streets and highways conform to National Highway Safety Program Standards, and where
   applicable, host nation requirements.
   1.2.8. Installation Traffic Engineer. Traffic engineers conduct formal traffic engineering
   studies. They apply traffic engineering measures and control devices to reduce the number
   and severity of traffic accidents. If there is no installation traffic engineer, the installation
   commander may request support services by contacting the Commander, Military Traffic
   Management Command, 5611 Columbia Pike, Falls Church VA 22041-5050.

                                    DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges.
2.1. (ROBINSAFB)Requirements for Operating a Motor Vehicle on Robins AFB. All
personnel operating a privately-owned vehicle (POV) on Robins AFB must have in their
possession, and provide, at the request of 78th Security Forces Squadron (78 SFS) personnel,
the following:
     2.1.1. Driving a government owned vehicle (GOV) or POV on an Air Force installation is a
     privilege granted by the installation commander. If you accept that privilege, you must
     comply with the laws and instructions governing motor vehicle operation and registration on
     the installation. Consequently, everyone operating a motor vehicle on a military installation
     must produce, upon request from the security police, the following:
     2.1.1. (ROBINSAFB) Current insurance coverage card for the vehicle being operated. This
     card must show the expiration date of the insurance policy. For rental vehicles, a vehicle
     rental agreement shall serve as valid proof of vehicle insurance. Personnel without a current
     insurance coverage card in their possession while operating a vehicle on Robins AFB will be
     cited and given a letter instructing them to report to the 78 SFS Reports and Analysis Section
     (78 SFS/S5R). A person cited must present a valid insurance card to 78 SFS/S5R within 3
     duty days. The card must show insurance coverage on the day (and at the time, if applicable)
     of the traffic stop or incident that caused coverage to be questioned. Failure of a driver to
     comply with the above requirements will indicate they were driving an “uninsured vehicle.”
     “Uninsured vehicle” is a vehicle without the minimum insurance coverage required for
     registration by the laws and regulations of the State of Georgia.
        2.1.1.1. Proof of vehicle ownership or registration if required by the issuing authority.
        2.1.1.2. A valid state, overseas command, host nation, or international driver’s license
        and/or AF Form 2293, US Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator’s Identification Card,
        supported by a DD Form 2, US Armed Forces Identification Card. Locally determine
        acceptable identification media for civilian personnel and base contractors. Note: Each
        installation commander must determine if international drivers licenses are recognized
        and accepted by the local (civilian) jurisdiction, and if so, will their use be authorized on
        the installation. As a general rule, most CONUS civilian jurisdictions will honor use of
        international drivers licenses for short periods of time by non-resident visitors and
        assigned military personnel. When practical, installation commanders should assimilate
        local policy to preclude conflicting policy.
        2.1.1.2. (ROBINSAFB) A valid state, overseas command, host nation, or international
        driver’s license, and/or AF Form 2293, US Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator’s
        Identification Card, supported by a DD Form 2, US Armed Forces Identification Card.
        According to GA Criminal and Traffic Law Manual/O.C.G.A 40-5-21, an international
        driver’s license is valid for a period of not more than 45 days from the date of the active
        duty member’s return to the United States.
AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010                                                            9


      2.1.1.3. If required by the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated, a valid record of
      motor vehicle safety inspection, emission control test, or any other test, evaluation, safety
      inspection, or other documents required by local, state, or host nation law or agreement.
      Note: In some instances, a state or other governing jurisdiction in which a vehicle is
      registered may require, as a condition for keeping registration/plates issued by that state
      or jurisdiction, a safety or other inspection even when the vehicle is operated in another
      state or jurisdiction. Though not enforceable (in another state), failure to comply may
      invalidate the vehicle registration leaving the owner/operator in a precarious legal
      position. In such cases, it becomes the owner's responsibility to comply with their "home
      state" or other issuing jurisdiction requirements in addition to host state requirements.
      Owners should secure host registration when unable to comply with licensing and/or
      registration requirements issued by their home state or other jurisdiction.
      2.1.1.4. Proof of current vehicle insurance when required by state, host nation, or the
      installation commander.
   2.1.2. (Added-ROBINSAFB) At a minimum, vehicle registrants must maintain adequate
   liability insurance coverage, as required by state law, which covers them and any other
   personnel authorized or granted permission to operate the registered POV. “Out-of-state
   visitors” to Robins AFB that are operating a vehicle not registered in Georgia, shall comply
   with the laws of the state in which the vehicle they are operating is registered. “Out-of-state
   visitor” means any short term visitor to Robins AFB that is not one of the following: a
   resident of Georgia, military member assigned to Robins AFB, or the family member of
   military personnel assigned to Robins AFB.
2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
2.2. (ROBINSAFB)Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
   2.2.1. The security police may stop vehicles on military installations based on the
   installation commander's authority. The following principles govern the stopping of motor
   vehicles:
      2.2.1.1. In overseas areas, security police may stop, search, and detain vehicles on or off
      base as determined by host nation agreements and local command policy.
      2.2.1.2. AFI 31-209, The Air Force Resource Protection Program, local command
      instructions, and policies established by the installation commander will detail stop,
      inspection, search, and impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry
      gates and in Air Force restricted areas.
      2.2.1.2. (ROBINSAFB) In accordance with AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation
      Security Program, as supplemented, 78 SFS personnel may inspect, search, and/or
      impound motor vehicles at installation entry points and other locations throughout Robins
      AFB in an attempt to prevent the introduction of unauthorized personnel, drugs, weapons,
      or illicit material, or the unauthorized removal of government supplies, property, or
      equipment.(Security Forces must have probable cause or consent to search vehicles base
      on base EXCEPT at entry check points and restricted areas).
 10                                            AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010


       2.2.1.3. On-base traffic stops and inspections (other than at entry gates and restricted
       areas) of POVs is authorized when there is a reasonable basis to believe it’s necessary to
       enforce a traffic regulation or when there is suspicion of criminal activity.
       2.2.1.3. (ROBINSAFB) To prevent unauthorized POVs from entering a restricted area
       as established in AFI 31-101, 78 SFS personnel may conduct on-base POV inspections
       when there is reasonable cause to believe installation resources may be in danger or there
       is suspicion of criminal activity.
   2.2.2. MAJCOMs responsible for overseas military installations must provide their
   installation commanders with written guidelines governing stop, inspection, search, and
   impoundment of vehicles. This guidance must reflect host nation agreements and pass
   appropriate legal review. Note: A theater commander or those commanding unified forces
   may direct policy covering all installations under their command. In this case, MAJCOMs
   must review those policies before issuing their guidance.
2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath, or Urine Tests. Drivers give consent to evidential
tests for alcohol or other drug content of their blood, breath, and/or urine as a condition to
accepting installation driving privileges. This consent applies when lawfully detained,
apprehended, or cited for any impaired driving offense committed while driving or in physical
control of a motor vehicle on an Air Force installation.
2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. As a condition to accepting installation
driving privileges, drivers must give their consent for the removal and temporary impoundment
of their POV if their POV is: 1) Illegally parked for unreasonable periods; 2) Interferes with
traffic operations; 3) Creates a safety hazard; 4) Disabled by accident or incident; 5) Left
unattended in, or adjacent to, a restricted, controlled, or off-limits area; and 6) Abandoned.
Drivers also agree to reimburse an authorized agency or contractor for the cost of towing,
storage, and disposal should a need arise to remove or impound their motor vehicle because of a
situation described above.
   2.4.1. Installation commanders define in local procedures or supplement to this instruction,
   the definitions for "unreasonable periods," "abandoned," and other terms relevant to
   enforcement action under paragraph 2.4 Incorporate those instructions, procedures, and
   definitions into the local installation traffic code and make them known to the general public.
2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges. Installation commanders may suspend
or revoke installation driving privileges and POV registration for lawful reasons both related and
unrelated to traffic violations or safe vehicle operations. Installation commanders must
incorporate procedures governing suspension and revocation in local publications or supplement
to this instruction. Make these known to the general public.
2.5. (ROBINSAFB)Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges.
   2.5.1. Suspensions.
       2.5.1.1. Installation commanders can suspend driving privileges for serious violations or
       when lesser measures fail to improve a driver's performance. The commander may also
       suspend or revoke licenses for up to 12 months if a driver continually violates installation
       parking standards, or habitually violates other standards considered non-moving in
       nature. Installation commanders determine suspension and revocation policy for non-
AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010                                                         11


     moving violations, as well as what constitutes a non-moving violation on their
     installation (i.e., performing unauthorized repair; failure to register; unauthorized
     modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc.). Make these
     standards part of the local installation traffic code and take reasonable steps to make them
     known to the general public.
     2.5.1.2. The installation commander has discretionary authority and may withdraw
     anyone's authorization to operate a government or privately owned motor vehicle on the
     installation.
     2.5.1.3. Installation commanders will immediately suspend installation GOV or POV
     driving privileges pending resolution of an intoxicated driving incident which involves
     active duty military personnel, their family members, retired members of the military
     service, and DoD civilian personnel. This applies regardless of the geographic location
     of an intoxicated driving incident. Installation commanders can only suspend privileges
     of non-DoD affiliated civilians for incidents occurring on the installation or in the areas
     subject to their military traffic jurisdiction. After a review of available evidence as
     specified in paragraph 2.6, suspend driver’s privileges pending resolution of the
     intoxicated driving incident under the circumstances outlined below:
     2.5.1.3. (ROBINSAFB) Before an individual is released from apprehension for
     intoxicated driving or driving while their state driver's license is suspended or revoked,
     they will be issued a "Notice of Preliminary Suspension of Installation Driving
     Privileges" (Attachment 1). If the individual refuses to acknowledge the receipt, the SFS
     member will annotate the refusal on the notice, sign it, and have another SFS Member act
     as witness by signing it. In the case where an individual is arrested off-base for
     intoxicated driving, the individual must report to 78 SFS/S5R to sign this notice, as soon
     as possible after the incident occurred. In addition, a “Suspension of Installation Driving
     Privileges” letter is sent to the first sergeant or civilian supervisor of the individual to
     report to 78 SFS/S5R.
         2.5.1.3.1. Refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested chemical test to determine
         blood alcohol content BAC) or breath alcohol content (BrAC) for alcohol or other
         drugs.
         2.5.1.3.2. Operating a motor vehicle with BAC or BrAC of 0.10 percent by volume
         or higher.
         2.5.1.3.3. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC below 0.10 percent blood
         alcohol by volume if the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated imposes a
         suspension for a BAC or BrAC level below 0.10.
         2.5.1.3.4. On an arrest report or other official document reasonably showing an
         intoxicated driving incident occurred.
  2.5.2. Revocation.
  2.5.2. (ROBINSAFB) Revocation.

          2.5.2.1.1. A person is lawfully detained for intoxicated driving and refuses to submit
          to or complete tests to measure blood alcohol or drug content as required by the law
          of the jurisdiction, installation traffic code, or this instruction.
          2.5.2.1.2. A conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or a military or civilian
          administrative action resulting in the suspension or revocation of a driver’s license for
          intoxicated driving. Official documentation is required as the basis for this type of
          revocation action.
          2.5.2.1.3. When a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs and the
          installation commander determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is
          required to preserve public safety or the good order and discipline of military
          personnel.
      2.5.2.2. The CSP develops plans and procedures to forward revocation, suspension, and
      driving records to gaining commanders and to initiate appropriate staff action when
      receiving similar records from losing commanders of inbound personnel.
      2.5.2.3. When temporary suspensions are followed by revocations, compute the
      revocation period from the original suspension date, exclusive of any period during
      which full driving privileges were restored pending resolution of charges.
      2.5.2.4. Installation commanders may impose multiple suspensions to run consecutively
      or concurrently.
      2.5.2.5. (Added-ROBINSAFB) All vehicles registered to persons who have had their
      privilege to operate a vehicle suspended or revoked for a period of 6 months or greater
      must de-register the vehicle through the 78 SFS Pass and Registration Section (78
      SFS/S5P) and remove the vehicle from the installation for the period of the suspension or
      revocation.
          2.5.2.5.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) When a revocation or suspension period
          terminates, the vehicle owner must re-register the vehicle according to Chapter 3 of

          privileges revoked for a period of 6 months or greater must de-register their vehicle
          through 78 SFS/S5P and remove the vehicle from the installation. If the individual
          wishes to have a co-worker, friend, etc., who is affiliated with Robins AFB register
          their vehicle; they must obtain a notarized letter before the vehicle can be registered
          in the co-worker/friend’s name via an AF Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass, for the
          duration of the suspension. Once the suspension is terminated the owner will be
          required to re-register their vehicle through 78 SFS/S5P.
   2.5.3. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Reinstatement of driving privileges shall be automatic,
   provided all applicable revocations have expired and r proof of completion of remedial

   2.6.1. Air Force installation commanders will honor revocations issued by other installation
   commanders regardless of service component affiliation. Revocations remain in effect
   during reassignment unless the issuing authority terminates the revocation before
   reassignment. Installation commander may honor suspensions as determined on a case by
   case basis. Anyone with suspended or revocated privileges may petition an installation
   commander for partial or limited driving privileges.
   2.6.1. (ROBINSAFB) Revocations issued at Robins AFB will remain in effect during
   reassignment, temporary duty, etc. Suspensions and revocations issued at Robins AFB are
   valid at all DoD installations regardless of their location. Personnel with suspended or
   revoked privileges may petition for partial or limited driving privileges by following the
   procedures outlined in paragraphs 2.7.4 and 2.7.5 of this supplement. All suspensions and
   revocations are tracked through Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS)
   and are acknowledged by Robins AFB authorities, ensuring adherence to all rules.
2.7. Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
2.7. (ROBINSAFB)Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.7.1. When considering suspending or revoking someone’s driving privileges, notify that
   person in writing and tell them what action you are taking and the reason for it. Coordinate
   this notice with the base legal office.
   2.7.1. (ROBINSAFB) Upon determination by 78 SFS/S5R that driving privilege
   suspension or revocation action should be taken on an individual, a “Notice of Preliminary
   Suspension of Installation Driving Privileges” letter notifying the individual of the
   impending suspension or revocation will be forwarded to the military member's first sergeant
   or commander, or the civilian employee’s supervisor. For all other personnel, the letter will
   be sent to the individual’s home mailing address.
   2.7.2. Except for incidents outlined in para 2.5.1.3 and 2.5.2.1, do not suspend or revoke a
   person's driving privileges until they are notified (or reasonable attempts made) and offered
   an administrative hearing. Installation commanders determine when a suspension or
   revocation takes effect once making or attempting this written notice. Only in unusual
   circumstances should you make verbal notifications. Unless an application for a hearing is
   made within the prescribed period, suspension or revocation takes place on the prescribed
   date and time. Installation commanders determine the time period for staying a suspension
   or revocation action after receiving a request for a administrative hearing. For offenses
   outlined in para 2.5.1.3 and 2.5.2.1, an installation commander will authorize an immediate
   preliminary suspension based on reliable evidence. Such evidence can include witness
   statements, a military or civilian police report, chemical test results, a refusal to complete
   chemical testing, video tapes, written statements, field sobriety test results, or other evidence.
   2.7.2. (ROBINSAFB) In the “Notice of Preliminary Suspension of Base Driving
   Privileges” letter the individual will be given the opportunity to request a hearing to
   dispute/modify the suspension/revocation. This letter must be returned NLT 10 business
   days after the date of the letter to 78 SFS/S5R. If the individual fails to return this letter
   within the allotted time, the individual relinquishes the right to a hearing and action will be
   taken to suspend/revoke the individuals driving privileges. The “Notice of Preliminary
   Suspension of Base Driving Privileges” letter will be considered as the “reasonable attempt”
14                                           AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010


  necessary to fulfill this requirement prior to suspension/revocation action. Hearings for
  suspensions and revocations will be in accordance with paragraphs 2.7.4 and 2.7.5 of this
  supplement.
     2.7.2.1. Installation commanders or their designee must conduct evidence reviews as
     soon as possible, but no later than three duty days following final assembly of evidence.
     2.7.2.2. For active duty military personnel, send a written notice of preliminary
     suspension for intoxicated driving to their commander or reasonable equivalent. For non-
     installation, non-DoD affiliated civilians, present the written notice of preliminary
     suspension for intoxicated driving either in person (preferred) or by certified mail. If the
     person is employed on the installation, send the notice to their commander or reasonable
     equivalent.
     2.7.2.3. Advise the individual of the following in the preliminary suspension notification
     for intoxicated driving:
         2.7.2.3.1. Suspension can be made a revocation under the authority of paragraph
         2.5.2 of this AFI.
         2.7.2.3.2. The right to request restoration of driving privileges pending investigation
         or resolution of the incident (direct request letters to the installation commander or
         designee).
         2.7.2.3.3. The right of military personnel to present evidence and witnesses and be
         represented by a civilian counsel (at their own expense) or assigned military counsel.
         Commanders determine the availability of specific (by name) military counsel
         requests.
         2.7.2.3.4. The right of DoD civilian employees to have a personal representative
         present at the administrative hearing in accordance with applicable laws and
         instructions.
         2.7.2.3.5. Amount of time the individual has to respond and request the
         administrative hearing before the preliminary suspension or revocation becomes
         permanent.
         2.7.2.3.6. Direction to sign the acknowledgment of receipt and to return the signed
         letter to the address shown in the letter.
         2.7.2.3.7. Requested hearings must take place within a reasonable period which is
         determined by the installation commander. A preliminary suspension for intoxicated
         driving remains in effect until the installation commander makes a final decision.
         However, if no decision is made within 30 days of the preliminary suspension or
         revocation, restore full driving privileges until the accused is notified of the final
         hearing results.
  2.7.3. Hearings for intoxicated driving will cover only the pertinent issues of whether: 1)
  The law enforcement official had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or
  was in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other
  drugs; 2) The person was lawfully cited or apprehended for an intoxicated driving offense; 3)
  The person was asked to submit to a test for alcohol or other drug content of blood, breath, or
  urine and was informed of the consequences for refusing to take or complete such a test; 4)
AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010                                                              15


   The person refused to submit to the test for alcohol, breath, or urine; failed to complete the
   test; submitted to the test and the result exceeded the amount of allowed blood alcohol
   content; results indicate the presence of other drugs for an on-installation apprehension or in
   violation of state laws for an off-installation apprehension; and 5) The testing methods used
   were valid and reliable, and the results accurately recorded and evaluated.
       2.7.3.1. For revocation actions under paragraph 2.5.2.1 for intoxicated driving, the
       revocation is mandatory on conviction or other findings that confirm the charge.
           2.7.3.1.1. The date of conviction or other findings that confirm the charge is the
           effective date of the revocation.
           2.7.3.1.2. You may place the notice that revocation is automatic in the suspension
           letter, or send a separate letter. Revocation is not effective until receipt of the written
           notice, or the showing that you made reasonable attempts to notify the individual.
           2.7.3.1.3. Revocations cancel any partial or restricted driving privileges previously
           granted. Once revocation is acknowledged, a person may petition for the restoration
           of all or partial driving privileges.
   2.7.4. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Any person whose driving privilege has been suspended or
   revoked, or is pending suspension or revocation, has the right to have the
   suspension/revocation reviewed by the 78 ABW/CC or designee. As a result of this review
   the 78 ABW/CC, or designee, may or may not require an administrative hearing be held
   based on his or her review of the available evidence before rendering a decision on the
   request.
   2.7.5. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Individuals wishing an administrative hearing must submit a
   written request to         78 SFS/S5R and include in the request a complete return address,
   home and work telephone numbers, any evidence or witnesses, and the reason for requesting
   a hearing, limited driving privileges, or reinstatement of driving privileges. Active duty
   personnel requests must include an endorsement from their commander or first sergeant.
2.8. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs.
   2.8.1. Refer military personnel involved in any intoxicated (drug or alcohol) motor vehicle
   incident to Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol Control for evaluation.
2.9. Restoration of Driving Privileges on Acquittal. When an official report or finding
determines lack of guilt (not guilty) or when charges are dismissed or reduced to an offense not
amounting to intoxicated driving, vacate the suspension of driving privileges except when:
   2.9.1. The preliminary suspension was based on refusal to take a BAC test.
   2.9.2. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher or in
   violation of the law of the jurisdiction that is bring assimilated on the military installation.
   2.9.3. The person was driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under another
   preliminary suspension or revocation.
   2.9.4. The state or host nation authorities made an administrative determination to suspend
   or revoke driving privileges based on local law or pertinent regulations.

   2.9.5. The individual failed to complete a formally directed substance abuse or driver’s
   training program.
2.10. Restricted Driving Privileges or Probation.
   2.10.1. Unless prohibited by higher authority, host nation authority, or other publication,
   installation commanders may authorize partial or restricted driving privileges to those whose
   authority to drive on military installations was suspended or revocated by a military service
   authority. Ensure the individual’s driving credentials (civilian state, international, host
   nation, etc.) are still valid.
   2.10.2. Without due cause, do not grant restricted driving privileges, probation, or
   reinstatement to any person whose civilian driver’s license is under suspension or revocation
   by a state, federal, or host nation licensing authority. If absolutely necessary to do so (and
   for on base privileges only), coordinate with the installation staff judge advocate. Note: This
   option applies only to installations exercising exclusive military jurisdiction. Outline
   procedures for applying for partial or restricted privileges in the base supplement to this AFI
   or in another appropriate publication. Only consider requests in which there is extreme
   hardship and there are no other workable alternatives. Do not consider the granting of
   limited privileges as an alternative to administrative discharge action when discharge is the
   more appropriate action. Installation commanders must weigh heavily the potential
   liability inherent when an individual with a suspended or revoked state, host nation, or
   other license is allowed to operate a motor vehicle on the installation. Administrative
   separation may be appropriate when the loss of driving privileges renders someone
   ineffective and incapable of performing their military duties, and a change in duty position is
   not reasonable.
2.11. Extensions of Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.11.1. Increase by two years the suspension or revocation period when someone is
   discovered driving in violation of their original suspension or revocation. The unit or
   installation commander may also take administrative or disciplinary action.
   2.11.2. Extend the suspension or revocation of installation driving privileges until the
   offender completes an approved remedial driver training course, drug or alcohol program, or
   other program deemed necessary by the installation commander or local authorities.
2.12. Reciprocal State-Military Action.
   2.12.1. Statutory authority may exist within some host nations or states for reciprocal
   suspension and revocation of driving privileges. If so, the installation commander should
   honor the reciprocal agreements with the state or host nation driver licensing authorities. On
   receipt of written notice, the receiving party may suspend or revoke driving privileges as if
   the violations or incidents occurred within its own jurisdiction.
       2.12.1.1. Use the following procedures if statutory authority does not provide for formal
       military reciprocity:
          2.12.1.1.1. When such authority suspends or revokes a license, automatically
          terminate the individual’s installation GOV and POV driving privileges. Take only
          comparable military administrative actions (suspensions, revocation, or point
AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010                                                        17


         assessment) for those off-base violations reported by local, state, or host nation
         authorities.
         2.12.1.1.2. In the CONUS, notify the licensing authority of the state where a license
         is issued when revoking a person’s installation driving privileges (for a period of one
         year or more only) following final adjudication of an intoxicated driving offense or
         for refusal to submit to a BAC/BrAC test. Include in the notification the basis for the
         revocation and the BAC/BrAC level.
  2.12.2. Provisions of the applicable status of forces agreement (SOFA) and the law of the
  host nation concerning reciprocal suspension and revocation can affect OCONUS installation
  commanders. When permitted at a particular overseas installation and to the extent an
  agreement concerning reciprocity exists, the installation commander must have prior
  authorization to negotiate and conclude such an international agreement in accordance with
  applicable directives.

                            TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Traffic Planning
   4.1.1. Safe and efficient movement of traffic on an installation requires traffic supervision.
   A strong traffic supervision program includes sound traffic circulation planning, supervision,
   and control of motor vehicle traffic. Proactive publication and enforcement of traffic laws
   and regulations together with timely and professional investigation of motor vehicle
   accidents are also important. Finally, every successful program must include meaningful
   interaction, education, and communication with the general public.
   4.1.2. Installation commanders develop traffic circulation plans that provide for the safest
   and most efficient use of primary and secondary roads. A major focus of installation traffic
   planning is circulation control. The base traffic engineer, CSP, safety officer, and other
   concerned staff agencies develop the traffic circulation plan. Consult with highway
   engineering representatives from adjacent civilian communities to ensure the installation plan
   is compatible with plans developed by the state and surrounding local communities. As a
   minimum, your base traffic plan should consider the following:
      4.1.2.1. Normal and peak load routing based on traffic control studies.
      4.1.2.2. Effective control of traffic, using planned traffic flow patterns which include
      measures for special events and adverse road conditions.
      4.1.2.3. Point control at congested locations by law enforcement personnel or designated
      traffic directors or wardens, including trained school-crossing guards.
      4.1.2.4. Use of traffic control signs and devices.
      4.1.2.5. Efficient use of available parking facilities.
      4.1.2.6. Efficient use of mass transportation.
      4.1.2.7. Every installation commander should appoint a primary and alternate base traffic
      engineer. The engineer directs, develops, and staffs the base traffic circulation plan.
      This is normally a civil engineering responsibility and those considered for the position
      should have an infrastructure planning and engineering background.
   4.1.3. Traffic control studies provide factual data on existing roads, traffic density and flow
   patterns, and points of congestion. The CSP and traffic engineer usually conduct coordinated
   traffic control studies to obtain the data. Accurate data helps determine major and minor
   routes, locations for traffic control devices, and special conditions requiring engineering or
   enforcement services.
   4.1.4. The Military Traffic Management Command Transportation Engineering Agency
   (MTMCTEA) will help installation commanders solve complex highway traffic engineering
   problems. MTMCTEA traffic engineering team services include:
      4.1.4.1. Traffic studies of lifted areas and other special situations.
      4.1.4.2. Complete studies of traffic operations of entire installations.

       4.1.4.3. Assistance in complying with established traffic engineering standards.
   4.1.5. Installation commanders submit requests for MTMCTEA assistance in accordance
   with AFR 75-88, Highways for National Defense.
4.2. Installation Traffic Codes.
4.2. (ROBINSAFB)Installation Traffic Code.
   4.2.1. Installation commanders must establish a traffic code for operation of motor vehicles
   on the installation. Commanders in overseas areas establish a traffic code to the extent
   military authority is empowered to regulate traffic under applicable treaties or agreements.
   Installation traffic codes must contain the base rules of the road and will, to the degree
   possible, conform to the code of the state or host nation in which the installation is located.
   The CSP is responsible for developing the traffic code and for ensuring it meets all local and
   legal requirements, this AFI, and the standards published in the following:
       4.2.1.1. The National Highway Safety Program Standards, as published in 23, CFR
       1230.
       4.2.1.2. Applicable portions of the Uniform Vehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance
       published by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, which is
       contained in 23, CFR 1204.
       4.2.1.3. DoDI 6055.4, DoD Traffic Safety Program.
   4.2.2. The installation traffic code must contain policy and procedures for the towing,
   searching, impounding, and inventorying of vehicles. Publish these provisions and ensure
   they contain the following:
       4.2.2.1. Violations and conditions to tow or impound a vehicle.
       4.2.2.1. (ROBINSAFB) Towing and impoundment of vehicles. Illegally parked
       vehicles, suspected abandoned vehicles, or vehicles creating an immediate safety hazard,
       will be towed by civilian towing companies at the direction of the 78 SFS. (When towing
       or impounding vehicles the 78 SFS must follow guidelines and procedures set in AFI 31-
       204, para 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4, along with any additional requirements identified in SFOI 31-
       26).
       4.2.2.2. Procedures to notify the vehicle owner.
       4.2.2.2. (ROBINSAFB) The 78 SFS personnel will attempt to identify and notify the
       owner/operator to have the vehicle moved prior to being towed.
       4.2.2.3. Procedures for towing, storing, and protecting impounded vehicles.
       4.2.2.3. (ROBINSAFB) Abandoned Vehicles. The 78 SFS patrols will be on alert for
       suspected abandoned vehicles throughout the installation. Patrolman will attempt to
       locate the owner of suspected abandoned vehicles prior to any processing. If the owner
       cannot be located or contacted, a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, will be
       issued for possible abandonment. If the owner does not remove the vehicle within 3 days
       a DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice, will be issued. The DD Form 2504 will be
       held for a period of 3 duty days by the 78 SFS Investigations Section (78 SFS/S2I). The
AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010                                                       23


     status of the vehicle will be checked after the 3 days, and if it remains abandoned, a
     wrecker service will be directed to tow the vehicle to the 78 SFS/S2I impoundment lot.
     4.2.2.4. Procedures for disposing of vehicles after lawful impoundment.
     4.2.2.4. (ROBINSAFB) If a contracted wrecker service is used the 78 SFS/S2I should
     accomplish a DD Form 2505, Abandoned Vehicle Removal Notice, also ensure to follow
     local operating procedures. When the vehicle is removed from the installation 78 SFS/S2I
     will accomplish a DD Form 2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report, and forward to 78
     SFS/S2I. The 78 SFS/S2I will then forward a DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle
     Impoundment to the last known owner of the vehicle to advise the owner of the
     impoundment action.
  4.2.3. Where applicable, installation traffic codes must supplement the various basic
  provisions contained in the subparagraphs below:
     4.2.3.1. Motorcycles and mopeds. Operators must comply with special requirements
     when driving motorcycles, mopeds, or other open two-, three-, and four-wheel vehicles
     powered by a motorcycle-type engine. See paragraph 4.2.6 for information concerning
     off-road vehicle use. Installations should adopt local, state, or host nation guidance
     concerning the legal definition, operation, use, and control of mopeds, motorized
     bicycles, and other such devices on installation roadways. Such guidelines will be
     modified or restricted as necessary to ensure personal safety or the safe and orderly flow
     of installation traffic. Refer to AFI 91-207 for helmet, eye, and clothing safety
     requirements.
     4.2.3.1. (ROBINSAFB) Motorcycles and Mopeds. The word "motorcycle" as used in

        4.2.3.2.4. Cars manufactured after model year 1966 require a manufacturer-approved
        restraint system meeting federal traffic safety standards.
        4.2.3.2.5. Operators using vehicles equipped with air bags must still wear the
        manufacturer's primary restraint system (seat belts).
        4.2.3.2.6. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Operator responsibilities to ensure compliance are
        as follows:
            4.2.3.2.6.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Government Owned Vehicle (GOV). The
            vehicle operator must inform his or her passengers of the requirements to use
            occupant restraints. The ranking person present should ensure this requirement is
            observed. Any person not wearing restraint devices in the vehicle may be cited
            for non-compliance.
            4.2.3.2.6.2. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Privately Owned Vehicle (POV).            The
            vehicle operator is ultimately responsible for compliance; however, personnel
            present in the vehicle not wearing restraint devices may be cited for non-
            compliance.
     4.2.3.3. Headphones and earphones. The wearing of headphones and earphones is
     prohibited while driving a motor vehicle on base. This does not negate wearing of
     hearing protection when conditions and good judgment dictate its use such as when
     driving in noise hazard areas. This restriction does not apply to intercom systems worn by
     motorcycle operators and their passengers.

     4.2.3.3. (ROBINSAFB) Prohibition of Cellular (Cell) Phone Usage. All motor vehicle
     operators on Robins AFB to include government owned, privately owned, and
     commercially owned vehicles, are prohibited from using a cell phone, personal digital
     assistant (PDA), or Blackberry™, unless the vehicle is safely parked or the operator is
     using a hands-free device. The wearing of portable headphones, earphones, or other
     listening devices (except for hand-free cell phones) while operating a motor vehicle is
     also prohibited. Additionally, all vehicle operators are prohibited from using a cell
     phone, PDA, or Blackberry™ while entering or exiting installation gates.
         4.2.3.3.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Suspected violation of this policy is considered a
         primary offense (reason for traffic stop). Citations will be issued to the operator for
         violating this policy and three (3) points will be assessed against his or her driving
         record.
     4.2.3.4. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Golf Cars (not carts) and Low Speed Vehicles. The
     National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has established law in the Code of
     Federal Regulations (CFR) which addresses slow moving conveyances that do not meet
     traditional Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These conveyances commonly
     referred to as scooters or utility carts, are legal to operate on military installation public
     roadways if specific criteria are met. Golf cars/low speed vehicles are non-registered
     assets procured as equipment items using unit funds and are accounted for on the owning
     unit’s CA/CRL. The following definitions and criteria apply:
         4.2.3.4.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Golf Cars are small utility conveyances that are
         incapable of exceeding 20 mph. They are only subject to state and local requirements
         regarding safety equipment for use on military installation public roads. If golf cars
         are modified from original manufacture specifications to obtain speeds in excess of
         20 mph, they are classified as motor vehicles and must meet Federal Motor Vehicle
         Safety Standards.
         4.2.3.4.2. (Added-ROBINSAFB) A Low Speed Vehicle (LSV) is any four-wheeled
         conveyance with a top speed greater than 20 mph, but less than 25 mph. LSVs are
         classified as motor vehicles and must meet specific Federal Motor Vehicle Safety
         Standards (49 CFR 571.500) to operate primarily on military installation public roads.
         LSVs must be equipped with specified headlamps, stop lamps, turn signal lamps,
         reflectors, parking brakes, rearview mirrors, windshields, seat belts, and vehicle
         identification numbers.      LSVs of truck design, operating primarily on
         installation/public roads, must meet the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards
         specific to trucks.
     4.2.3.5. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Conveyances designed or modified to operate at speeds
     greater than 25 mph must meet all Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards which apply
     to passenger carrying vehicles if the vehicle is to be operated primarily on military
     installation public roads.
  4.2.4. Take only administrative actions (reprimand, assessment of points, loss of installation
  driving privileges, etc.) for off-installation violations of the installation traffic code.
  4.2.5. At bases with concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction, make violations of state
  traffic codes applicable to base driving records when those violations are included in that
26                                           AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010


  state’s criminal offense code. This provision is covered under the authority of Title 18 United
  States Code 13 (USC).
     4.2.5.1. DoDD 5525.4, Enforcement of State Traffic Laws on DoD Installations, adopts
     the vehicular and pedestrian traffic laws of states where traffic law violations are not
     considered criminal offenses and cannot be assimilated under 18 USC. It makes these
     laws applicable to military installations having concurrent or exclusive federal
     jurisdiction. It also delegates authority to installation commanders to establish additional
     vehicular and pedestrian traffic rules and regulations for their installations. Those found
     guilty of violating traffic laws made applicable on installations under provisions of
     DoDD 5525.4 are subject to a fine of not more than $50 or imprisonment for not more
     than 30 days or both for each violation. In those states where you cannot assimilate
     traffic laws, post an extracted copy of this paragraph and a copy of DoDD 5525.4 in a
     prominent place accessible to persons assigned, living, or working on the installation.
         4.2.5.1.1. Take only administrative actions in states where you cannot assimilate
         violations of traffic laws under either Title 18 USC 13 or DoDD 5525.4. Generally,
         this applies to installations under part or full proprietary jurisdiction.
  4.2.6. Off-road vehicles usage: The installation commander or his or her designee
  determines if, when, and where off-road vehicles may be operated on base. In many areas,
  the operation of off-road vehicles is unregulated while other jurisdictions have strict
  requirements concerning age, safety training, and vehicle equipment. Generally, some "on-
  street" safety practices such as reflective vests, gloves, headlight on, and goggles may not
  apply when operating off road in a recreational capacity. However, ensure full compliance
  with local, state, or host nation requirements. When necessary, develop additional
  procedures and guidance locally and publish in the installation traffic safety plan or
  supplement to this instruction. Ensure environmental considerations are reviewed prior to
  designating any off-road vehicle use area.
  4.2.7. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Authorized emergency vehicles. The following exemptions
  are granted to an authorized emergency vehicle only when the vehicle is making use of an
  audible siren and emergency warning lights. The 78 SFS vehicles will be exempted from this
  requirement if the use of siren and/or emergency lights would, or could expect to, prevent a
  desired undetected arrival to potentially hostile situations. The driver of an authorized
  emergency vehicle, when responding to an emergency call, may exercise the following
  privileges:
     4.2.7.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Park or stand at any location on the installation. Every
     attempt should be made to avoid impeding the flow of traffic.
         4.2.7.1.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Proceed past a stop sign, but only after slowing
         down as may be necessary for safe operation.
         4.2.7.1.2. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Exceed the maximum speed limits by 10 mph,
         when necessary, as long as life or property is not endangered.
  4.2.8. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Speed restrictions.

         beginning of and following end of school hours when school is in session.
         4.2.8.1.4. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Parking lots and loading areas: 10 mph unless
         otherwise posted.
         4.2.8.1.5. (Added-ROBINSAFB) While driving in reverse: 5 mph.
     4.2.8.2. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Flightline speed limits excluding active runways are as
     follows:
         4.2.8.2.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) GOV: 15 mph in areas on the flightline where
         aircraft movement or other current restrictions prevail.
         4.2.8.2.2. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Vehicles operating outside established driving
         lanes are restricted to 15 mph.
         4.2.8.2.3. (Added-ROBINSAFB) During periods of limited visibility, or when ice,
         slush, or snow exists, maximum vehicle speeds may be reduced to ensure roadway
         safety.
         4.2.8.2.4. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Vehicle speed while operating near aircraft will
         be restricted to 5 mph.
  4.2.9. (Added-ROBINSAFB) The responsibility for safe driving rests with the vehicle
  operator. The limits and exceptions listed herein do not relieve operators of their
  responsibilities for safe, prudent operations under normal or emergency conditions, or during
  adverse weather conditions.
  4.2.10. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Driving on sidewalk. No person shall drive a vehicle upon
  a sidewalk or sidewalk area except where a permanent or duly authorized temporary
  driveway has been established crossing the sidewalk.
  4.2.11. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Skateboarders and skaters must ride in a manner so as not
  to interfere with pedestrian and vehicle traffic and are prohibited in the following areas:
  picnic table tops, tennis courts, and any other area not specifically designed or constructed
  for skateboard use. Due to the inability to mount proper safety equipment, skateboards will
  not be operated during hours of darkness or decreased visibility.
     4.2.11.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Individuals utilizing roller or in-line skates or
     skateboards will not be permitted to use them on any roadways or parking lots where
     motor vehicles are in operation. Skateboards/skates may be used on sidewalks if right of
     way is given to pedestrians and due care is used.
     4.2.11.2. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Skateboarders/skaters operating in a prohibited area
     will be issued a verbal warning.

  4.2.12. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Open Alcohol Beverage Containers. An open alcoholic
  beverage container in moving vehicles upon any roadway is prohibited. It is the
  responsibility of the vehicle operator to ensure this policy is adhered to. Citations will be
  issued to the operator for violating this policy and two (2) points will be assessed against his
  or her driving record.
  4.2.13. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Unattended children in vehicles. No children, under the age
  of 12 years, will be left unattended in any vehicle on Robins AFB. When children 12 years
  of age and older are left in a vehicle, the vehicle will not be running and the child will not
  have or be able to gain possession of the vehicle keys, unless the child possesses a valid
  driver’s license or permit. No children over 12 years of age, who do not possess a driver's
  license or permit, will be left unattended in vehicles for periods exceeding 15 minutes. Upon
  notification of children being left unattended in vehicles, 78 SFS personnel will be
  dispatched to assess the situation and ensure the protection of the children.
  4.2.14. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Personnel are not permitted to perform motor vehicle
  repairs in parking lots or on roadsides; however, minor emergency maintenance, which
  normally take less than 1 hour to complete, may be done provided no safety hazard exists.
     4.2.14.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Operators of vehicles which become mechanically
     inoperative on the roadway will make every effort to remove the vehicle from the
     roadway. If the vehicle must be left unattended, a note explaining the problem and
     identifying the owner will be placed in a visible location on or in the vehicle.
     Unregistered vehicles where the owner cannot be identified or contacted may be towed
     from the area without the owner's permission.
  4.2.15. (Added-ROBINSAFB) The display of bumper stickers or other signs or
  paraphernalia that embarrass or disparage the President of the United States; espouse illegal
  discrimination based on race, creed, color, sex, religion or national origin; advocate the use
  of force or violence to deprive individuals of their civil rights; or otherwise endanger military
  good order and discipline, are prohibited.
  4.2.16. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Failure to obey traffic guard. No person shall willfully
  refuse to comply with any lawful order or directive of any 78 SFS member, fire department
  personnel or other authorized traffic cordon guard with authority to direct, control or regulate

  vehicle is traveling or onto which it is turning.
     4.2.17.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) No pedestrian shall suddenly leave a curb or other
     place of safety and walk or run into the path of a vehicle which is so close that it is
     impractical for the driver to yield.
     4.2.17.2. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Whenever any vehicle is stopped at a marked
     crosswalk or at any unmarked crosswalk at an intersection to permit a pedestrian to cross
     the roadway, the driver of any other vehicle approaching from the rear shall not overtake
     and pass such stopped vehicle.
AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010                                                          29


      4.2.17.3. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Crossing roadway elsewhere than at crosswalk.
      Pedestrians crossing a roadway at any other point than within a marked crosswalk or
      within an unmarked crosswalk at an intersection shall yield the right of way to all
      vehicles upon roadway unless they have under safe conditions, already entered the
      roadway.
      4.2.17.4. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Pedestrians must yield to authorized emergency
      vehicles. Upon the immediate approach of an authorized emergency vehicle making use
      of an audible signal and visual signals, pedestrians shall yield the right of way to the

4.3. Traffic Law Enforcement Principles.
   4.3.1. Traffic law enforcement should motivate drivers to operate vehicles safely within
   traffic laws and regulations and maintain an effective and efficient flow of traffic. Effective
   enforcement should emphasize selective enforcement and voluntary compliance by drivers.
   You can reach these goals by developing effective programs in the following areas.
      4.3.1.1. Publishing a realistic traffic code well known by all personnel.
      4.3.1.2. Adopting standard signs, markings, and signals in accordance with National
      Highway Safety Program Standards (NHSPS) and the Manual on Uniform Traffic
      Control Devices for Streets and Highways.
      4.3.1.3. Ensuring enforcement personnel establish courteous, personal contact with
      drivers, and act promptly when driving behavior is improper or when observing a
      defective vehicle in operation.
      4.3.1.4. Maintain an aggressive program to detect and apprehend those who drive with
      suspended or revoked privileges.
      4.3.1.5. Use sound discretion and judgment in deciding when to apprehend, issue a
      citation, or warn the offender.
   4.3.2. Enforcement activities against intoxicated driving will include:
      4.3.2.1. Detecting, apprehending, and testing persons suspected of driving under the
      influence of alcohol or drugs.
      4.3.2.2. Training law enforcement personnel in special enforcement standards, detection
      techniques, and equipment standards unique to your location and jurisdiction.
      4.3.2.3. Enforcing blood-alcohol concentration standards (see paragraph 4.11).
      4.3.2.4. Denying installation driving privileges to those whose use of alcohol or drugs
      prevents their safe operation of a motor vehicle.
4.4. Speed-measuring Devices. Use speed-measuring devices in traffic control studies and
enforcement programs. Post signs to indicate the use of speed-measuring devices.
   4.4.1. Equipment purchases. Installations located in states having a formal civilian police
   training and certification program for speed measurement should consider purchasing the
   same brand and model of equipment used by their civilian counterparts. Where possible,
   attend the same or similar certification courses used by local authorities.
 30                                            AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010


   4.4.2. Training and certification standards.
       4.4.2.1. The CSP should strive to ensure operators of speed-measuring devices meet
       training and certification requirements prescribed by the state or jurisdiction where the
       installation is located. Obtain specific information on course dates, costs, and
       prerequisites for attending by contacting the state agency responsible for police traffic
       radar training. Notwithstanding the above information, the CSP may establish other local
       training and certification programs for operators of speed-measuring devices. If
       exercising this option, you must ensure your qualification and training standards are
       admissible as evidence and considered reliable by both military and civil authorities.
       This requirement applies to courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings, and civilian courts
       used to prosecute civilian offenders. Coordination between the military staff judge
       advocate and attorney general (or equivalent) is necessary.
       4.4.2.2. Develop local training programs or attend a civilian institution or manufacturer's
       training program if security police are unable to attend local or state-sponsored radar
       certification courses.
       4.4.2.3. The objective of civilian or manufacturer-sponsored courses is to improve the
       effectiveness of speed enforcement through the proper and efficient use of speed-
       measurement radar. On successful completion, the course graduate must know how to:
          4.4.2.3.1. Describe the association between excessive speed and accidents, deaths,
          and injuries, and describe the traffic safety benefits of effective speed control.
          4.4.2.3.2. Describe the basic principles of radar speed measurement.
          4.4.2.3.3. Identify and describe Air Force speed measurement and speed enforcement
          policy and procedure.
          4.4.2.3.4. Identify the specific radar instrument used and describe the instrument’s
          major components and functions.
          4.4.2.3.5. Demonstrate basic skills in calibrating and operating the specific radar
          instrument(s).
          4.4.2.3.6. Demonstrate basic skills in preparing and presenting records and
          courtroom testimony relating to radar speed measurement and enforcement.
   4.4.3. Recertification. Certify operators every three years or more frequently when required
   by the state or governing jurisdiction. The CSP must document and maintain certification
   and training standards in the unit training section. Forward records to gaining unit
   commanders when personnel PCS.
   4.4.4. Use the following sources in local training and certification programs:
       4.4.4.1. State or local training guides, plans, and procedures.
       4.4.4.2. Publish techniques for radar speed detection and legal aspects of speed-
       measuring devices by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the
       International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training.

   4.5.1. Conduct detailed investigations of the following:
   4.5.1. (ROBINSAFB) Detailed investigations will be conducted on Robins AFB for the
   following:
       4.5.1.1. All accidents involving a fatality or personal injury.
       4.5.1.1. (ROBINSAFB) All accidents involving a fatality or personal injury or
       disability damage over $10,000.
       4.5.1.2. Vehicle and private property damage over the amount specified by the
       installation commander. This applies to government as well as private vehicles and
       property damage; however, the installation commander may establish different damage
       amounts for each category.
       4.5.1.2. (ROBINSAFB) All accidents where vehicle and private property damage is
       over $10,000. This applies to government as well as private vehicles and property
       damage.
       4.5.1.3. (Added-ROBINSAFB) All other accidents are considered minor and will be
       facilitated in accordance with AFMC Instruction 31-201, Security Forces Standards and
       Procedures, Minor Accident Worksheet.
   4.5.2. Conduct investigations of off-installation accidents involving military personnel
   according to local policy developed by the CSP and local police leaders.
NOTE: Generally, a detailed accident investigation includes, but is not limited to, an accident
report form, field sketch, scale diagram, and accident narrative.


4.6. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
4.6. (ROBINSAFB)Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
   4.6.1. Anyone involved in an on-base vehicle accident must immediately report the incident
   to the security police. Report off-base accidents to the security police if they involve injuries
   to military personnel or damage to military property. The installation commander determines
   what agencies to notify and for what type of accidents to notify them. The CSP must develop
   a local notification matrix or other procedures that will ensure notification of appropriate
   base and civilian agencies. Develop and publish these notification procedures locally.
   4.6.2. The security police will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident
   information. Record the information in the security police desk blotter. When possible,
   obtain copies of major accident reports prepared by investigating civilian police agencies.
   4.6.3. Security police respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents (unless local conditions
   or policies prohibit) to accomplish the following:
   4.6.3. (ROBINSAFB) The 78 SFS will respond to all reported accidents on Robins AFB as
   manning permits. AF Form 1315, Accident Report will be accomplished for all major
   accidents identified in paragraph 4.5. AFMC Form 625, Minor Accident Worksheet, will be
   accomplished for all minor vehicle accidents.
       4.6.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
 32                                           AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010


       4.6.3.2. Protect personal property.
       4.6.3.3. Normalize traffic.
       4.6.3.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
       4.6.3.5. Conduct a formal investigation.
       4.6.3.6. The CSP determines (with installation commander approval) when and/or if
       minor vehicle accidents require investigation or a police response. He or she may
       delegate this authority to on-duty security police supervisory personnel. Develop policy
       in this area locally.
   4.6.4. Report minor accidents not involving a security police response to the security police
   within 72 hours. Record accident information in the security police blotter. This information
   should include the accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit
   (or address when civilian not affiliated with military), vehicle description, and license
   number(s). You should also include a brief summary of any damage and circumstances
   behind or causing the accident. A minor accident is any accident in which there are no
   fatalities/injuries or vehicle/property damage above the amount established by the installation
   commander. Consequently, a major accident is any accident involving a fatality, injury, or
   property damage above the amount established by the installation commander. The
   installation commander may set differing amounts for government versus private vehicle and
   property damage. The investigation of major accidents involve specialized accident
   investigative techniques to draw conclusions and opinions about how and why the accident
   occurred.
       4.6.4.1. Injury is defined as any one of the following caused or aggravated by a motor
       vehicle accident:
          4.6.4.1.1. Any condition requiring medical attention
          4.6.4.1.2. Complaint or report of pain or injury regardless if medical attention is
          sought
          4.6.4.1.3. Any visible injury. This includes bruises, contusions, cuts, scrapes,
          compression, or any other visible damage to the body.
4.7. Use of Traffic Accident Investigation Report Data.
   4.7.1. Analyze data derived from traffic accident investigations to determine accident causes.
   When frequent accidents occur in one area, analyze location conditions, type of accidents,
   and other factors in an attempt to isolate causes. With the exception of privacy act
   information, make accident data and trend analysis available to agencies requesting the data
   for reporting and analytical purposes. With the exception of requests filed under the
   Freedom of Information Act, the CSP determines the agencies cleared to receive accident and
   incident data.
   4.7.2. Law enforcement personnel and others who prepare traffic accident investigation
   reports will indicate if a seat restraint was used at the time of the accident, and where
   applicable, if air bags deployed.
4.8. Parking.
AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010                                                          33


4.8. (ROBINSAFB)Parking. RAFBI 31-205, Base Parking, governs all parking issues on
Robins AFB.
   4.8.1. Illegal parking contributes to congestion and slows traffic flow on the installation.
   Strong enforcement of parking rules results in better use of available parking while reducing
   traffic accidents and hazards. Combine enforcement with community education and
   awareness initiatives in areas where illegal parking is a problem. When education and
   awareness fail, installation commanders may authorize more serious enforcement measures
   such as towing and "booting" of vehicles. Do not use towing and booting if less severe
   means of enforcement such as warnings, ticketing, reprimands, revocations, etc., prove
   effective. When using towing and booting, follow the guidelines below:
       4.8.1.1. Publish operating instructions to control discretion of enforcers and limit towing
       or booting to specific offenses.
       4.8.1.2. Focus on specific reasons for towing or booting. Booting is effective for
       immobilizing unsafe vehicles, or vehicles not inspected or registered. Use booting in
       high offense areas or to compel the presence of repeat offenders. Towing is more
       effective for moving vehicles that pose safety hazards. Some examples include double
       parking, and blocking fire hydrants and fire lanes.
       4.8.1.3. Notify drivers that certain violations or multiple violations may result in towing
       or booting. Also, provide drivers a prompt opportunity to obtain release of their property.
       4.8.1.4. Warn drivers when a boot is attached to their vehicle and instruct them on how
       to have the boot removed without damaging the vehicle.
   4.8.2. Reserved Parking. When not addressed by MAJCOMs, installation commanders
   determine reserved parking policy for their installations. Number of available spaces, facility
   design and layout, traffic flow, and number of vehicles using facilities will help determine
   the number and location of reserved parking spaces. Make policy and procedures governing
   reserved parking a part of the installation supplement to this instruction, separate traffic
   control instruction, or base parking plan. The publication must address approval, issue,
   control, and review of reserved parking and should give special consideration to bicycle,
   motorcycle, visitor, and car pool parking. Handicap parking is regulated under the uniform
   federal accessibility standards and applies to all Air Force installations.
   4.8.3. You can use distinctive emblems, decals, stickers, etc., to control parking space
   assignments and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. If this identification media is
   placed on a vehicle bumper, separate it from the vehicle registration identification.
   MAJCOMs (or installation commanders if not addressed by the MAJCOM) may develop
   policy concerning the issue and control of the identification media discussed above.
   4.8.4. You can use parking wardens (unit personnel) to monitor and cite parking violators,
   especially within off-street parking facilities.
       4.8.4.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) The 78 SFS/CC has authorized 78 SFS members and
       officially designated installation parking monitors to issue DD Form 1408, Armed Forces
       Traffic Ticket. Once appointed, parking monitors are trained by the 78 SFS Police
       Services Section (78 SFS/S5L).
4.9. Traffic Violation Reports.
 34                                            AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010


4.9. (ROBINSAFB)Traffic Violation Reports.
   4.9.1. Commanders should deal with most traffic violations occurring on Air Force
   installations within Air Force channels.
   4.9.2. You can refer traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations (within the United
   States or its territories) to the proper US Magistrate. Do not refer violations in the following
   circumstances:
      4.9.2.1. The operator is driving a government vehicle at the time of the violation.
      4.9.2.2. A US Federal Magistrate is either not available or lacks jurisdiction to hear the
      matter because the violation occurred in an area where the federal government has only
      proprietary legislative jurisdiction.
      4.9.2.3. Mission requirements make referral of offenders impractical.
      4.9.2.4. A US Magistrate is available, but the accused refuses to consent to the
      jurisdiction of the court and the US attorney refuses to process the case before a US
      district court.
   4.9.3. Issue traffic violators on military installations a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic
   Ticket, or a DD Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice. The CSP
   determines who is authorized to issue those forms and what training they must complete
   before issuing either form. The DD Form 1408 is issued to the following personnel: active
   duty personnel, Cadets/Midshipmen of the Military Academies to include the Coast Guard
   Academy, reservists on orders or performing inactive duty training including commuting to
   and from training, and guardsman in federal service under Title 10 of the United States
   Code. Title 10 status is reflected on the guardsman’ s orders. Issue civilians the DD Form
   1805, or the DD Form 1408 when a US Magistrate system is not available.”
   4.9.4. Installation commanders establish procedures for disposing of traffic violation cases
   through administrative or judicial action consistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice
   (UCMJ) and federal law. Additionally, forward a copy of all violation reports on military
   personnel and DoD civilian employees apprehended for intoxicated driving to the Substance
   Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol Control.
   4.9.5. Unless restricted under the provisions of para 4.9.2, use the DD Form 1805 to refer
   civilian violators of state and federal traffic laws to the appropriate US magistrate. Notify the
   commander, first sergeant, or supervisor when any military personnel or DoD civilian
   employees is cited with the DD Form 1805. If requested, locally reproduce a copy of the DD
   Form 1805 and make it available to the commander, first sergeant, or supervisor.
      4.9.5.1. Preparation of the DD Form 1805. This prenumbered form is issued through
      standard publication channels and is only accountable once it is issued to an offender.
      Before issuing this form, stamp (type) in black ink the specific address of the clerk of the
      US District Court (Central Violations Bureau) to which the violator must address the
      communication, on the reverse of the violator’s copy (manila card stock) of the four-part
      form. Determine the entry for the amount of the fine, mandatory court appearance of the
      offender, and the date of appearance according to guidance furnished by the governing
      district court.
AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010                                                             35


       4.9.5.2. Identify the assimilation of state traffic laws by a specific state code reference in
       the CODE SECTION block of the DD Form 1805 or in a complaint filed with the US
       magistrate.
       4.9.5.3. Use the statement of probable cause on the DD Form 1805 according to local
       staff judge advocate and US magistrate court policy. The statement of probable cause is
       required by the federal misdemeanor rules to support the issuance of a summons or arrest
       warrant.
       4.9.5.4. For cases referred to US magistrate, normal distribution of DD Form 1805 is as
       follows:
          4.9.5.4.1. The CSP forwards copy 1 (white) and copy 2 (yellow) to the US District
          Court (Central Violation Bureau).
          4.9.5.4.2. Security police file copy 3 (pink).
          4.9.5.4.3. Provide copy 4 (envelope) to the violator.
NOTE: Ensure unit personnel are notified IAW para 4.9.5. above.


       4.9.5.5. When DD Form 1408 is used, distribute the form as follows:
          4.9.5.5.1. Provide the pink copy to the violator with normal reporting instructions
          and rebuttal instructions as determined by the installation commander.
          4.9.5.5.2. Forward the white copy to the service member’s commander, to the
          commander of the family member’s sponsor, or to the civilian’s supervisor or
          employer for administrative action within the unit/organization.
          4.9.5.5.3. Forward the yellow copy to the security police administration branch for
          processing and tracking until the white "action copy" is returned by the unit
          commander, section commander, or first sergeant. When the white copy is received,
          review it for action taken, annotate the information in SPAS or the AF Form 1313,
          Driver Record, with the moving or non-moving violation and any points assessed.
          File the white and yellow copies with the driver record.
              4.9.5.5.3.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Upon receipt of the white and yellow copies
              of the DD Form 1408, 78 SFS/S5L will enter the information into SFMIS. The
              white copy of the citation will be sent out for command action and the yellow
              copy will be filed for suspense. NOTE: First sergeants or other authorized
              personnel may complete the administrative process of the ticket; however, the
              ticket must be signed by the violator’s unit or squadron section commander.
              4.9.5.5.3.2. (Added-ROBINSAFB) The white copy, along with a cover letter, is
              forwarded to the first sergeant or civilian supervisor informing the individual of
              the violation. The first sergeant or civilian supervisor will endorse blocks 25-29
              on the back of the white copy and return it to 78 SFS/S5L indicating action has
              been taken.
4.10. Standards and Procedures for Processing Intoxicated Drivers.
 36                                           AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010


   4.10.1. As a minimum, the CSP must train installation law enforcement personnel to do the
   following:
      4.10.1.1. Recognize signs of alcohol and other drug impairment in persons operating
      motor vehicles.
      4.10.1.2. Prepare DD Form 1920, Alcohol Influence Report, or other form which
      adequately documents sobriety and sobriety testing of an individual.
      4.10.1.3. Perform standard field sobriety tests. The standardized Air Force field sobriety
      test consists of the one leg stand, the walk and turn, and the horizontal gaze nystagmus.
      Also consider any local, state, or host nation sobriety test requirements in addition to the
      above standard Air Force tests.
      4.10.1.4. Determine to a reasonable and practical degree when a person appears
      intoxicated, but is actually physically or mentally ill and requires prompt medical
      attention.
      4.10.1.5. Understand the operation of breath-testing devices.
   4.10.2. Each installation using breath-testing devices will ensure operators of these devices:
      4.10.2.1. Are chosen for integrity, maturity, and sound judgment.
      4.10.2.2. Meet installation, and where possible, state certification standards.
   4.10.3. Use only breath-testing devices listed on the approved NHTSA conforming products
   list published in the Federal Register. Ensure only trained personnel administer tests as
   specified in paragraph 4.13 and adhere to the procedures described in paragraphs 4.14 and
   4.15 relating to voluntary and involuntary testing.
   4.10.4. Installations located in states or overseas areas with no formal training program will
   develop their own training program following material and guidance from selected civilian
   institutions or manufacturers of the equipment. Coordinate local training programs with the
   installation staff judge advocate and state's attorney general (or local equivalent) to ensure
   your program meets local requirements for legal admissibility. Conduct refresher training at
   the intervals determined by the CSP and staff judge advocate.
4.11. Blood Alcohol Concentration Standards.
   4.11.1. Uniformly apply administrative revocation of driving privileges and other
   enforcement measures to offenders driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. When a
   person is tested per paragraph 2.3, evaluate the results of the test as follows:
      4.11.1.1. If the percentage of alcohol in the person’s blood is less than 0.05 percent,
      presume the person is not under the influence of alcohol.
      4.11.1.2. If the percentage is 0.05 but less than 0.10, presume the person is impaired.
      Consider this standard with other competent evidence in determining whether the person
      was under the influence of alcohol. Suspend driving privileges according to para 2.5
      Note: The 0.10 threshold delineating impaired from intoxicated can be lesser level when
      assimilating a more stringent local, state, or host nation standard.
      4.11.1.3. If the percentage is 0.10 (or lesser amount when assimilating local, state, or
      host nation standards) or more or if tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs, the person
AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010                                                             37


      is considered to have been driving under the influence of intoxicants. Suspend driving
      privileges according to para 2.5.1.3
   4.11.2. Percentages in paragraph 4.11.1 are percent of weight by volume of alcohol in the
   blood based on grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. Installation commanders will
   modify military standards to agree with a more stringent state, local authority, or host nation
   standard. Refer to Assessment #3, Table 5.1
   4.11.2. (ROBINSAFB) An individual is considered driving while intoxicated if their blood
   alcohol content (BAC) level meets or exceeds the levels listed in paragraphs 4.11.2.1,
   4.11.2.2. and 4.11.2.3, or if tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs.
      4.11.2.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Individuals ages 21 or older - 0.08.
      4.11.2.2. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Individuals driving a commercial vehicle - 0.04.
      4.11.2.3. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Individuals under the age 21 - 0.02.
4.12. Chemical Testing Policies and Procedures.
   4.12.1. Results of chemical testing are valid under this instruction only under the following
   circumstances:
      4.12.1.1. Testing of blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substances using generally
      accepted scientific and medical methods and standards.
      4.12.1.2. Qualified personnel administer breath tests.
      4.12.1.3. Use of a nonportable breath-testing device approved by the state or host nation.
   4.12.2. If the state or host nation has not established procedures for use of breath-testing
   devices, then apply the following procedures if you use portable breath-testing devices: 1)
   During the initial traffic stop as a field sobriety testing technique in lieu of or in conjunction
   with other field sobriety testing techniques as long as the state or host nation does not
   prohibit such use, and 2) According to the manufacturer's operating instructions.
      4.12.2.1. Use nonportable evidentiary breath-testing devices as follows:
          4.12.2.1.1. Observe the suspected person for at least 20 minutes before collecting the
          breath specimen. During this time, the person must not drink, eat, smoke, chew
          tobacco, or ingest any substance.
          4.12.2.1.2. Verify calibration and proper operation of the instrument according to
          manufacturer's specifications and any specific local, state, or host nation
          requirements.
          4.12.2.1.3. Comply with operational procedures in the manufacturer’s current
          instruction manual. Perform the preventive maintenance as required by the owner's
          manual.
   4.12.3. Chemical tests of personnel involved in fatal accidents.
      4.12.3.1. Installation medical authorities will immediately notify and brief the CSP upon
      death of any person involved in a motor vehicle accident. Subject to military jurisdiction,
      medical authorities will examine anyone killed in an on-base motor vehicle accident or
      mishap. Conduct tests for the presence and concentration of alcohol or other drugs in the
 38                                            AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010


       blood, bodily fluids, or tissues as soon as possible and where practical within eight hours
       of death. Include the test results in the medical reports.
       4.12.3.2. As provided by law and medical conditions permitting, obtain a blood or breath
       sample from any surviving operator whose vehicle is involved in a fatal accident.
4.13. Detection, Apprehension, and Testing of Intoxicated Drivers.
   4.13.1. Most of the time you will detect drunk drivers by observing unusual or abnormal
   driving behavior. Stop these drivers and determine the cause of their unusual driving
   behavior. If you reasonably conclude that the individual in control of the vehicle is impaired,
   perform field sobriety tests. The DD Form 1920 is used in examining, interpreting, and
   recording results of such tests. Use the standard field sobriety tests outlined in para 4.10
   Specific procedures for administering them can be found in AFH 31-227, Air Force Motor
   Vehicle and Traffic Control. Also see AFH 31-227 for procedures and guidance concerning
   the use of traffic mazes, DWI checkpoints, and other drunk driving reduction measures.
4.14. Voluntary Breath and Bodily Fluid Testing Based on Implied Consent.
   4.14.1. Implied consent policy is explained in paragraph 2.3
   4.14.2. Administer tests only when the following conditions are met:
       4.14.2.1. The person was lawfully stopped while driving or while in physical control of a
       motor vehicle on the installation.
       4.14.2.2. Reasonable suspicion exists to believe the person was driving under the
       influence of alcohol or drugs.
       4.14.2.3. A request was made of the person to consent and he or she was advised that
       failure to voluntarily submit to or complete a chemical test of bodily fluids or breath may
       result in revocation of on-base driving privileges.
   4.14.3. The installation commander prescribes the type of chemical tests used. Advise the
   driver that the installation commander may revoke driving privileges if they fail to
   voluntarily submit to or complete a requested chemical test and that they do not have the
   right to have an attorney present before deciding if they will or will not take the test. Testing
   will follow policies and procedures in paragraph 4.12 Also advise the driver that you can use
   the results of chemical tests conducted under the implied consent provisions of this
   instruction as evidence in courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings under Article 15 of the
   UCMJ, administrative action, or civil court proceeding.
   4.14.4. Special rules exist for persons who have hemophilia, other blood-clotting disorders,
   or any medical or surgical disorder under treatment with an anticoagulant. Such people may
   refuse a blood extraction without penalty, but you can offer a breath or urine test, or both.
   You must outline these procedures and the type of medical conditions that qualify for
   nonpunitive refusal in readily available medical guidelines located in emergency rooms or
   other reasonable areas where blood samples might be drawn from those suspected of drunk
   driving. Valid refusals must have the concurrence of a medical doctor.
   4.14.5. If a person suspected of intoxicated driving refuses to submit to a chemical test, do
   not administer a test except as specified in paragraph 4.15
4.15. Involuntary Extraction of Bodily Fluids in Traffic Cases.
AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010                                                        39


  4.15.1. These procedures pertain only to the investigation of individuals stopped,
  apprehended, or cited on a military installation for any offense related to driving a motor
  vehicle and for whom probable cause exists to believe that such individual is intoxicated.
  Rule 312d, Military Rules of Evidence, and regulatory rules concerning requesting and
  granting authorizations for searches govern the extraction of body fluids in furtherance of
  other kinds of investigations. Air Force policy on nonconsensual extraction of blood samples
  is further addressed in AFI 44-102, Patient Care and Management of Clinical Services.
  4.15.2. Involuntary bodily fluid extractions (blood or urine) require valid search and seizure
  authorizations. A person subject to the UCMJ who does not consent to chemical testing, and
  who subsequently refuses a lawful order to surrender to the test,. may nonetheless be forced
  to submit to an involuntary extraction of bodily fluids. As a general rule, forced extractions
  are considered only when an individual is involved in an accident in which there is a death,
  serious personal injury, or significant property damage. Probable cause must exist to believe
  the individual was driving or was in control of a vehicle while under the influence of an
  intoxicant. Conduct the extraction in accordance with the following procedures: 1) A search
  authorization by an appropriate commander or military magistrate obtained pursuant to Rule
  315, Military Rules of Evidence, is required prior to such nonconsensual extraction; 2) A
  search authorization is not required under such circumstances when there is a clear indication
  that one will find evidence of intoxication and there is reason to believe that the delay
  necessary to obtain a search authorization would result in the loss or destruction of the
  evidence sought; and 3) Conduct warrantless searches only after coordination with the
  servicing staff judge advocate and attempts to gain authorization from an appropriate official
  fail because of the unavailability of the appropriate commander or military magistrate.
     4.15.2.1. If authorization from the military magistrate or commander proves
     unsuccessful (due to nonavailability), the commander of a medical facility is empowered
     by Rule 315(d), Military Rules of Evidence, to authorize such extraction from an
     individual located in the facility at the time an authorization is sought.
         4.15.2.1.1. Before authorizing the involuntary extraction, the commander of the
         medical facility should, if circumstances permit, coordinate with the servicing staff
         judge advocate.
         4.15.2.1.2. The medical facility commander authorizing an extraction under Rule
         315(d) need not be on duty as the attending physician. Any qualified medical person
         can perform the extraction.
         4.15.2.1.3. The authorizing official may consider his or her own observations of the
         individual in determining probable cause.
  4.15.3. Authorization for the nonconsensual extraction of blood samples for evidentiary
  purposes by qualified medical personnel is independent of and not limited by provisions
  defining medical care, such as the provision for nonconsensual medical care pursuant to AFR
  160-12. Only qualified medical personnel administer extractions and use only reasonable
  measures to accomplish the procedure. Assistance to overcome an individual’s resistance to
  the extraction is normally provided by law enforcement personnel or unit personnel acting
  under orders from the member’s commanding officer or designee. Do not use any form of
  life endangering force to effect nonconsensual extractions.
 40                                            AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010


       4.15.3.1. Nonconsensual extraction will not interfere with or delay proper medical
       attention. Medical personnel determine the priority given to involuntary fluid extractions
       when other medical treatment is required.
4.16. Testing at the Request of the Apprehended Person.
   4.16.1. A person subject to tests under paragraph 2.3 can request additional testing. These
   tests are paid for by the requesting individual, and an approved facility such as an off-base
   hospital or research laboratory performs the tests. If they desire admissibility of other tests in
   a military or civilian court of law, they must ensure the state (or host nation when in an
   overseas area) approves the test and test method. Complete all tests as soon as possible,
   noting any delay on the resulting documents.
   4.16.2. If someone requests additional testing, the apprehending official may help make
   those arrangements. However, tests conducted under authority of the UCMJ remain valid
   when circumstances prevent timely release of the individual, or for whatever reason
   additional testing is not completed.
4.17. Off-installation Traffic Activities. Civil authorities enforce traffic laws in areas not
under military control. Likewise, the security police often investigate on-base accidents and
incidents of interest to local authorities. Consequently, the CSP must develop a program for the
sharing and exchanging of information with civil authorities. In overseas areas, these procedures
are generally well documented in formal agreements with the host nation. Local procedures
must cover the receiving, processing, and securing of traffic and related incident reports received
from other investigative agencies.
4.18. Compliance With Local and State Laws.
   4.18.1. Installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws
   when operating government vehicles on or off base.
   4.18.2. Commanders coordinate with the proper civil law enforcement agency before
   moving government vehicles or property that require special handling or exceed legal limits
   such as weight, length, width, or other standards.
   4.18.3. Installation commanders should maintain a close liaison with civil enforcement
   agencies and encourage the following:
       4.18.3.1. When possible, the prompt release of government vehicles and operators
       involved in accidents or incidents.
       4.18.3.2. Prompt notice to military authorities when military personnel or drivers of
       government motor vehicles are involved in traffic accidents or detained for serious
       violations of civil traffic laws.
       4.18.3.3. Prompt notice of any state, local, or host nation action to suspend, revoke, or
       restrict the driving privileges of personnel assigned to the installation.
4.19. Civil-Military Cooperative Programs.
   4.19.1. The State-Armed Forces Traffic Workshop Program is an organized effort to
   coordinate military and civil traffic safety activities throughout a state or area. Installation
   commanders should cooperate and provide proper support and participation.

  4.19.2. The installation commander should establish a community-installation traffic
  workshop program to coordinate the installation traffic efforts with those of local
  communities. Sound and practical traffic planning depends on a balanced program of traffic
  enforcement, engineering, and education. Civilian and military legal and law enforcement
  officers, traffic engineers, safety officials, and public affairs officers should take part.

               DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. Use SPAS or the AF Form 1313 to record vehicle traffic accidents,
moving and parking violations, suspension or revocation actions, and traffic point assessments
involving military and DoD civilian personnel, their family members, and other personnel
operating motor vehicles on a military installation. In filling out the form, use the following
codes in the “accident classification” block:
   5.1.1. Identify individuals who are principals in a motor vehicle accident as “S” subject or
   “V” victim.
   5.1.2. Identify accidents appropriately with “MVA” minor vehicle accident; “NLD” no
   liability determined; “PD” property damage; “PI” personal injury; “G” government; “P”
   private; “V” vehicle; and “FO” fixed object.

Table 5.1. Suspension/Revocation of Driving Privileges (See Notes 1 and 2).
 Assessment: 1. Two-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation
 commander.
 Violation: Driving while driver’s license or installation driving privileges are under suspension or
 revocation.
 Assessment: 2. One-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation
 commander.
 Violation: Refusal to submit to or failure to complete chemical tests (implied consent).
 Assessment: 3. One-year revocation is mandatory on conviction.
 Violation:
 1. Manslaughter (or negligent homicide by vehicle) resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle.
 2. Driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor
 0.10% or greater. Note: Where state or local authority use a more stringent standard (i.e., 0.08 instead
 of 0.10), Air Force units will assimilate the more stringent standard.
 3. Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of any narcotic or while under the influence of any
 other drug (including alcohol) to the degree rendered incapable of safe vehicle operation.
 4. Use of a motor vehicle in the commission of a felony.
 5. Fleeing the scene of an accident involving death or personal injury (hit and run).
 6. Perjury or making a false statement or affidavit under oath to responsible officials relating to the
 ownership or operation of motor vehicles.
 7. Unauthorized use of a motor vehicle belonging to another, when the act does not amount to a felony.
 Assessment: 4. Suspension for a period of six months or less or revocation for a period not to exceed
 one year is discretionary.
AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010                                                          43


 Violation:
 1. Mental or physical impairment (not including alcohol or other drug use) to the degree rendered
 incompetent to drive.
 2. Commission of an offense in another state which, if committed on the installation, would establish
 grounds for suspension or revocation.
 3. Permitting an unlawful or fraudulent use of an official driver’s license.
 4. Conviction of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer.
 5. Conviction of racing on the highway.
 6. Excessive parking and other non-moving violations as covered under paragraph 2.5.1.1.
NOTE:
1.When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off-installation offense, the effective
date is the same as the date of civil conviction or the suspension or revocation date of state or
host nation driving privileges. This effective date can be retroactive.
2.No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied consent
violations, base revocations on a conviction by a civilian court, military courts-martial,
nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, or a separate hearing as otherwise
addressed in this instruction. If revocation for implied consent is combined with another
revocation such as one year for intoxicated driving, revocations may run consecutively (total of
24 months) or concurrently (total of 12 months). Apply the installation commander’s policy
systematically and not on a case-by-case basis.

Table 5.1. (ROBINSAFB) Suspension/Revocation or Driving Privileges.
Assessment: 5. (Added) Excessive Parking violations will be based on the following
conditions:
Violations.
1. (Added) Receipt of 3 parking tickets in any consecutive 12-month period will result in a 30-
day driving suspension.
2. (Added) Receipt of 4 parking citations in any consecutive 12-month period will result in a 60-
day driving suspension.
3. (Added) Receipt of 5 parking citations in any consecutive 12-month period will result in a 6-
month driving suspension.
4. (Added) Receipt of more than 5 parking citations in any consecutive 12-month period will
result in a 1-year revocation of driving privileges.
5. (Added) Illegally parking in a designated (general not personal) "handicapped" parking space.
The driver will incur a 30-day driving suspension for the first offense. A 60-day driving

NOTE:
3. (Added) Parking citations which result in a driving suspension will remain on an individual’s
driving record for 12 months and will be considered in subsequent driving suspensions
(Attachment 2).
Table 5.2. (Added) Point Assessment for Moving Violations (See Note 1).
1. (ROBINS) When two or more violations are committed on a single occasion, points may
NOT be assessed for each individual violation. When two or more violations are committed on a
single occasion, assess the points for the offense having the greater value.
5.2. The Traffic Point System. The traffic point system provides a uniform administrative
device to impartially judge service personnel's driving performance. This system is not a
disciplinary measure or a substitute for punitive action. Further, this system is not intended to
interfere in any way with the reasonable exercise of an installation commander’s prerogative to
issue, suspend, revoke, deny, or reinstate installation driving privileges.
5.3. Point System Application. The use of the point system and procedures prescribed herein
are mandatory. The point system applies to civilian personnel operating government vehicles on
and off the installation and to their POVs driven on-base. It applies to military personnel
operating GOVs and POVs on or off the installation and to dependents, civilian employees, and
all other individuals subject to this instruction operating POVs on the installation. Unless an
individual submits a rebuttal, assess points according to the Table 5.2 Also assess points to
individuals found guilty by a military or civilian court, or upon payment of fine or forfeiture of
pay and allowances, or posted bond or collateral. Do not use the point system for non-moving
violations.

Table 5.2. Point Assessment for Moving Violations (See Note 1).

2.Use this measure for other than minor vehicle safety defects or when a driver or registrant fails
to correct a minor defect (for example, a burned out headlight not replaced within the grace
period on a warning ticket).
3.Applies to not using or improper use of a child restraint device, i.e., car seat, infant carrier,
booster seat, belt/strap modification (when required by manufacturer) etc. Assess four points
when no restraint system of any kind is used.
5.4. Point System Procedures.
5.4. (ROBINSAFB)Point System Procedures.
   5.4.1. Reports of moving traffic violations recorded on DD Form 1408 or DD Form 1805
   will serve as a basis for determining point assessment.
   5.4.2. On receipt of DD Form 1408 or other military law enforcement report of a moving
   violation (e.g., AFI 3545) the unit commander or designated supervisor will conduct an
   inquiry. The commander will take or recommend proper disciplinary or administrative
   action.
   5.4.3. Distribute citation copies and process point assessments IAW para 4.9
   5.4.4. Installation commanders may require the following driver improvement measures as
   appropriate:
       5.4.4.1. Advisory letter through the unit commander or supervisor to any person who has
       acquired six traffic points within a six-month period.
       5.4.4.2. Counseling or driver improvement interview by the unit commander of any
       person who acquires more than six points but less than 12 traffic points within a six-
       month period.
       5.4.4.3. Referral for medical evaluation when a driver, based on reasonable belief,
       appears to have mental or physical limits that had, or may have, an adverse effect on
       driving ability.
       5.4.4.4. Attendance at driver improvement program (DIP) to improve driving skill,
       awareness, or attitude.
       5.4.4.5. Referral to an alcohol or drug treatment or rehabilitation facility for evaluation,
       counseling, or treatment. This action is required for active duty military personnel in all
       cases in which alcohol or other drugs are a contributing factor to a traffic citation,
       incident, or accident.
   5.4.5. The installation commander may suspend or revoke driving privileges as provided by
   this instruction regardless of whether these improvement measures are accomplished.
   5.4.6. Notify in writing anyone whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked (for one
   violation or an accumulation of 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic
   points within 24 consecutive months). Installation commanders determine suspension and
   revocation periods for offenses not covered in Table 5.1; however, any revocation must be
   for a period of 6 months or more. The installation commander may impose a longer
   suspension or revocation period (to include offenses in Table 5.1) based on the person’s
   overall driving record. Consider the frequency, flagrancy, and severity of moving violations,
   and the response to previous driver improvement measures. In all cases, military members
AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010                                                           47


   must successfully complete a prescribed course in remedial driver training before
   reinstatement of driving privileges.
   5.4.7. Points assessed against a person remain in effect for point accumulation purposes for
   24 consecutive months. Routinely review driver records to delete traffic points during
   records update while recording new offenses and forwarding records to new duty stations.
   Completion of a revocation based on points requires removal from the driver record of all
   points assessed before the revocation.
   5.4.8. Removal of points does not authorize removal of driving record entries for moving
   violations, chargeable accidents, suspensions, or revocations. Recorded entries will remain
   posted on individual driving records for the period of time indicated below.
       5.4.8.1. Chargeable nonfatal traffic accidents or moving violations--three years.
       5.4.8.2. Nonmandatory suspensions or revocations--five years.
       5.4.8.3. Mandatory revocations--seven years.
   5.4.9. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Personnel desiring to appeal the issuance of a traffic ticket
   (moving or non-moving) must make the appeal in writing and address it to the 78 SFS/CC
   thru 78 SFS/S5R within 10 calendar days from the ticket issue date. The appeal must include
   the reason they believe the ticket should not have been issued. Appeals received after 10
   calendar days will not be processed without proper justification.
       5.4.9.1. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Supervisors of personnel appealing tickets are not
       required to take action while the appeal is pending.
       5.4.9.2. (Added-ROBINSAFB) The 78 SFS/CC, or designee, will review each appeal
       for complicity and will make a recommendation based on the facts presented. The 78
       MSG/CC has 10 days after receipt to render a decision in the appeal.
       5.4.9.3. (Added-ROBINSAFB) Bargaining unit employees may grieve a traffic ticket
       according to the above procedure or according to guidelines set forth in their respective
       negotiated grievance procedures.
5.5. Disposition of Driving Records. Establish procedures to promptly notify the CSP when a
person assigned to or employed on the installation is transferred to another installation, released
from military service, or ends employment or affiliation with the installation.
   5.5.1. If persons transferred to another Air Force installation have valid points or other
   entries on their driving records, the CSP must forward the records to the CSP of the gaining
   installation. The gaining CSP should coordinate with applicable commanders and continue
   any Air Force suspension or revocation based on intoxicated driving or accumulation of
   traffic points. Traffic points for persons transferred will continue to accumulate as specified
   in para 5.4.7
   5.5.2. Follow AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and Responsibilities, and
   AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule, to maintain and destroy records of military
   personnel released from active duty. Driving records remain active in the case of immediate
   reenlistment, change of officer component, or military and civilian retirement when
   continued vehicle registration is authorized. Retain or destroy according to AFMAN 37-139

  records on civilian personnel who are terminating on-base employment or on-base
  registration.
  5.5.3. Forward driving records of military family members containing point assessments or
  other entries to the sponsor’s gaining installation and review in the same manner as for
  service members. Retain driving records of retirees electing to retain installation driving
  privileges. Do not delete points accumulated or entries on the driver record regarding
  suspensions, revocations, moving violations, or chargeable accidents from the driver records
  except per para 5.4.7 and 5.4.8

                    IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. General. This chapter provides the standards and procedures for law enforcement
personnel when towing, inventorying, searching, impounding, and disposing of POVs. This
policy is based on:
   6.1.1. The interests of the Air Force in crime prevention, traffic safety, and the orderly flow
   of vehicle traffic movement.
   6.1.2. The vehicle owner's constitutional rights to due process, freedom from unreasonable
   search and seizure, and freedom from deprivation of private property.
6.2. Standards for Impoundment.
   6.2.1. You should not impound a vehicle unless it interferes with traffic, threatens public
   safety or convenience, is involved in criminal activity, contains evidence of criminal activity,
   or is stolen or abandoned.
   6.2.2. The impoundment of vehicles is inappropriate if other reasonable alternatives exist.
   When possible, attempt to locate the owner of the POV and have the vehicle removed. If
   reasonably feasible, allow another responsible person to drive or tow the POV, if they first
   have permission from the owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle.
   However in such cases, the security police (or towing contractor) is not responsible for
   safeguarding the vehicle.
   6.2.3. Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the following conditions exist:
      6.2.3.1. The vehicle is illegally parked:
          6.2.3.1.1. On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked and interferes with
          the orderly flow of traffic.
          6.2.3.1.2. On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, on a railroad track,
          in a fire lane, or is blocking a driveway so that the vehicle interferes with operations
          or creates a safety hazard to other roadway users or the general public.
          6.2.3.1.3. When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place.
          6.2.3.1.4. In a “tow-away” zone that is so marked with signs.
      6.2.3.2. The vehicle interferes with or is involved in one of the following:
          6.2.3.2.1. Street cleaning or snow removal operations after attempts to contact the
          owner fail.
          6.2.3.2.2. Emergency operations during a natural disaster, fire, or other emergency.
          6.2.3.2.3. The vehicle was used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.
          6.2.3.2.4. The owner or person in charge of the vehicle is apprehended and therefore
          unable (or unwilling) to arrange removal of the vehicle.
          6.2.3.2.5. The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the
          public roadways.
 50                                           AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010


          6.2.3.2.6. The POV is disabled by a traffic accident and the operator is unavailable or
          physically incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or
          safekeeping.
          6.2.3.2.7. Law enforcement personnel reasonably believe the vehicle is abandoned.
6.3. Towing and Storage.
   6.3.1. The Air Force or a contracted wrecker service may tow and store impounded POVs
   depending on availability of towing services and the local commander’s preference.
   6.3.2. The installation commander designates a securable enclosed area on the installation
   for use as an impound lot. You may use an impoundment area belonging to a contracted
   wrecker service provided the area is reasonably secure. The CSP approves contractor
   impoundment areas and maintains keys for all on-base impoundment areas.
   6.3.3. Impound or tow POVs for appropriate violations of the installation traffic code or
   involvement in criminal activities under the direct supervision of law enforcement personnel.
6.4. Procedures for Impoundment.
   6.4.1. Unattended POVs.
      6.4.1.1. Conspicuously place DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice (See DODD
      5525.4), on POVs considered abandoned or improperly unattended. Document this
      action with an entry in the security police blotter.
      6.4.1.2. Allow the owner three days from the date the POV is tagged to remove the
      vehicle. Have the vehicle towed if it's not moved within the allotted time. If a contracted
      wrecker service is used, complete a DD Form 2505 according to local procedures.
      6.4.1.3. After the vehicle is removed, security police or the contractor completes the DD
      Form 2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report (See DODD 5525.4), as a record of action
      taken.
          6.4.1.3.1. Law enforcement personnel or the towing contractor conduct an inventory
          listing personal property. Do not open closed containers such as a suitcase unless
          necessary to identify the owner or if the contents might present a danger to the public.
          In most cases, listing the container and sealing it with security tape will suffice.
          6.4.1.3.2. Place personal property in a secure area for safekeeping.
      6.4.1.4. Forward DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle Impoundment (See DODD
      5525.4), by certified mail to the address of the last known owner of the vehicle to advise
      the owner of the impoundment action and request information concerning the owner’s
      intentions concerning the vehicle.
   6.4.2. Stolen POVs or vehicles involved in criminal activity.
      6.4.2.1. Keep vehicles in Air Force custody when holding them for evidentiary purposes.
      Release recovered stolen POVs to the registered owner, unless held for evidentiary
      purposes, or to the law enforcement agency reporting the vehicle stolen, as appropriate.
      6.4.2.2. At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government agencies will request
      the Air Force impound an on-base vehicle for reasons not related to military issues. Staff
AFI31-204_ROBINSAFBSUP_I 22 JULY 2010                                                           51


      such requests through the Staff Judge Advocate and CSP. When appropriate, comply and
      support such requests and impound the vehicle for a reasonable period. Release the
      vehicle if civil authorities do not take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period as
      determined by the installation commander.
6.5. Search Incident to Impoundment Based On Criminal Activity. Search of a POV in
conjunction with impoundment based on criminal activity will likely occur in one of the
following general situations:
   6.5.1. The owner or operator is not present. This situation could arise during traffic and
   crime-related impoundments and abandoned vehicle seizures. Do not search the vehicle
   unless evidence or contraband is in plain view or is readily discernible on the outside as
   evidence of criminal activity. When in doubt, obtain proper search authority before
   searching.
   6.5.2. The owner or operator is present. This situation can occur during a traffic or criminal
   incident or if the operator is apprehended for a crime or serious traffic violation and
   sufficient probable cause exists to seize the vehicle. In some cases, the operator is present
   but is unwilling, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to make adequate arrangements to
   safeguard the vehicle. As a general rule, you may search vehicles without search authority
   when there is a reasonable danger to police or public, there is a risk of loss or destruction of
   evidence, or the search is reasonable under rules governing search incident to apprehension.
6.6. Disposition Of Vehicles After Impoundment.
   6.6.1. When a vehicle is impounded, hold it for as long as necessary for evidentiary, law
   enforcement, or other legal purposes. Unless directed otherwise by competent authority,
   release vehicles and property when no longer needed for one of the reasons stated above.
   Review Title 10, USC 2575, Disposition of Unclaimed Property, and DoD Directive
   4160.21-M, Defense Reutilization Marketing Manual, (when DRMO is used) before taking
   action to dispose of vehicles not claimed by the owner or an authorized agent.
   6.6.2. A vehicle is considered abandoned 60 days after making reasonable good faith efforts
   to contact the owner or when the owner is contacted and fails to take appropriate steps to
   assume responsibility for the vehicle. When owners decline to recover their vehicles, attempt
   to secure release of the vehicle by having the registered owners complete and sign the DD
   Form 2507. The 60-day waiting period does not apply when the owner releases the vehicle
   to the Air Force on DD Form 2507, signed letter, power of attorney, or other legally
   recognized document.
      6.6.2.1. Once the vehicle becomes the lawful possession of the Air Force, process the
      vehicle as abandoned property in accordance with local procedures. Unless otherwise
      directed, installation commanders have considerable latitude in determining the best use
      for, or disposal of, abandoned property. Scrap, auction, or use to support Morale,
      Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) activities are potential options. Consider local, state, or
      if applicable, host nation requirements. If you process vehicles through the Defense
      Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO), follow applicable DRMO and DoD directives.
6.7. Forms Prescribed.
   6.7.1. AF Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass
