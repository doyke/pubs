       QUAL/MSN evaluation applies to all MDS outlined in paragraph 1.1.1. AECMs will fly
       supervised in all aircraft until qualification status is reinstated.
           1.9.1.4.1. If failure to pass a flight evaluation is related to the QUAL portion of the
           evaluation, the recheck may be conducted on any aircraft listed in 1.1.1.
           1.9.1.4.2. If failure to pass a flight evaluation is related to the MSN portion of the
           evaluation in which the flight evaluation is accomplished, a successful flight or
           ground recheck will be accomplished on that aircraft.
           1.9.1.4.3. If failure to pass a flight evaluation is specifically related to MSN Areas 23
           and 25 and not related to the aircraft in which the flight evaluation is accomplished,
           the recheck may be accomplished by ground recheck.
               1.9.1.4.3.1. (Added-459ARW) Ground Recheck. If failure is for MSN areas
               23-25 this may be cleared through a ground re-check. Schedule ground rechecks
               through the Standardization and Evaluation office. Identify on AF Form 3862
               only those areas to be evaluated on the ground recheck. The evaluator will sign on
               the front of the AF Form 3862 after completion.
    1.9.2. Instructor (INSTR) Evaluations. To initially qualify as an instructor, the AECM will
    successfully complete the initial instructor upgrade program IAW AFI 11-2AE V1 and initial
    instructor (INIT INSTR) evaluation. Subsequently, aircrew members designated as
    instructors will be evaluated on their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations.
    Crewmembers will not use their initial instructor evaluation to satisfy the requirements of a
    periodic evaluation.
    1.9.3. SPOT Evaluations. IAW AFI 11-202V2. In addition, SPOT evaluations for Universal
    Qualified AECMs may be conducted on the C-17, C-130 or KC-135.
AFI11-2AEV2_459ARWSUP_I 28 January 2011                                                       9


  1.9.4. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, if
  applicable, to further describe evaluations:
     1.9.4.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a crew position or instructor
     qualification. INIT QUAL/MSN evaluations should be conducted on the unit assigned
     aircraft.
     1.9.4.2. Re-qualification (RQ). Use the prefix RQ (e.g., RQ QUAL/MSN, RQ INSTR)
     IAW AFI 11-202V2.
     1.9.4.3. No-Notice (N/N). (See AFI 11-202V2.) The C-21 may be used to satisfy the
     N/N requirements for units with a C-21 mission. Any N/N evaluation given on a C-21
     will not be converted to a QUAL/MSN.
  1.9.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). Use AFI 11-202V2 and the following:
  Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of aircraft emergency procedures, emergency
  medical procedures and medical equipment emergency functions for all initial, re-
  qualification, and periodic QUAL/MSN evaluations (see paragraph 2.4).
     1.9.5.1. Group Standardization and Evaluation office (OG/OGV) will develop and
     maintain a list of EPE program requirements (topics, special interest, etc.). OG/OGV will
     also develop an EPE guide detailing the evaluation areas and conduct of the EPE. EPEs
     will emphasize emergency procedures and systems knowledge. Examiners may use one
     continuous scenario throughout the EPE, or use different scenarios as required to ensure
     appropriate areas are evaluated.
         1.9.5.1.1. (Added-459ARW) Group Standardization and Evaluation Office
         OG/OGV. Guidance for Emergency Procedure Evaluation (EPE) requirements can
         be found in 2.4 EPE Procedures Evaluations. OG/OGV will place EPE guides in
         each evaluation folder. EPE Scenarios can be found on the AES share drive but will
         also be included in folders. EPE Scenarios will be updated at least yearly. Applicable
         HQ AMC special interest areas/items will be incorporated, emphasized, and/or
         demonstrated during all evaluations. Items that require increased focus as identified
         by the 459 OG/OGV will also be addressed on each evaluation.
     1.9.5.2. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in-flight. The
     examinee will recite, perform, or write all Boldface items without reference.
         1.9.5.2.1. (Added-459ARW) Boldface. Failure of monthly boldface testing, when
         not receiving an evaluation, is utilized as a training opportunity and members will be
         instructed and allowed to re-test.
     1.9.5.3. An EPE is a ground phase requisite. An EPE will be conducted on the ground
     anytime during the in-phase period. It will be through hands-on demonstration, and/or
     verbal discussion where hands-on demonstration is not feasible (e.g., aircraft emergency).
     The EPE will be conducted in a closed room or on a static aircraft offering one on one
     non-interference environment between examiner and examinee. EPE will include but is
     not limited to the following medical equipment: Bag-Valve-Mask Resuscitator, Cardiac
     Monitor, Suction Unit, Oxygen Equipment, and a Patient Mannequin for use during
     medical scenarios.
 10                                         AFI11-2AEV2_459ARWSUP_I 28 January 2011


          1.9.5.3.1. (Added-459ARW) EPE’s conducted in a closed room may be conducted
          in the 459 AES equipment room.
       1.9.5.4. Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified will be placed in
       supervised status until recommended additional training and re-evaluation are completed.
       Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified because of unsatisfactory
       Boldface procedures will not be permitted to fly in their aircrew position until a
       successful re-evaluation is accomplished. Accomplish additional training IAW AFI 11-
       202V2.
          1.9.5.4.1. (Added-459ARW) Notify 459 OG/OGV of a failed EPE. If additional
          training is required 459 OG/OGV will forward a Form 1 with identified areas
          requiring training to 459 AES Aircrew Training. The Form 1 must be received back
          in the 459 OG/OGV offices prior to the member being rescheduled for an EPE.
1.10. Grading Policies. See AFI 11-202V2, Chapter 5, Evaluations, and the following:
   1.10.1. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not possible, the area may be verbally
   evaluated on the ground unless otherwise noted in this AFI. As a minimum, Safety
   Consciousness (Area 4), Flight Discipline (Area 5), Crew Resource Management (Area 6),
   Airmanship/Situational Awareness (Area 7), and Standards of Care/Plan/Implements Nursing
   Care (Area 11) will be evaluated in-flight. Exceptions to the minimum in-flight requirement
   are on a case-by-case basis only and will be approved by MAJCOM/A3V. Flight examiners
   will make every effort to evaluate all required areas in-flight before resorting to this
   provision. If an alternate method is used to complete the evaluation, document in the
   Additional Comments portion of the AF Form 8.
1.11. Grading System. See AFI 11-202 V2 Chapter 5
1.12. Conduct of Evaluations.
   1.12.1. Flight examiners will pre-brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, requirements
   of the evaluation, and all applicable evaluation criteria. Flight examiners will then evaluate
   the examinee in each graded area/subarea.
       1.12.1.1. Flight examiners will normally not evaluate personnel they have primarily
       trained, recommended for upgrade, or who write their effectiveness/performance reports.
   1.12.2. Unless otherwise specified, flight examiners may conduct the evaluation in any
   applicable crew position (example: MCD, FN, CMT, 2AET, or 3AET) that will best enable
   the examiner to conduct a thorough evaluation, observe the examinee’s performance and
   allow for mission accomplishment. EXCEPTIONS: All INIT QUAL/MSN and RQ
   QUAL/MSN evaluations will be conducted in the Medical Crew Director (MCD) for FN or
   Charge Medical Technician (CMT) for AET position.
   1.12.3. Note discrepancies and deviations from prescribed tolerances and performance
   criteria during the evaluation. Compare the examinee’s performance with the tolerances
   provided in the grading criteria and assign an appropriate grade for each area.
       1.12.3.1. An evaluation will not be changed to a training flight to avoid documenting
       substandard performance, nor will a training flight be changed to an evaluation.
AFI11-2AEV2_459ARWSUP_I 28 January 2011                                                          11


       1.12.3.2. The judgment of the flight examiner, guidance provided in AFI 11-202V2, and
       this instruction will be the determining factors in assigning an overall qualification level
       on the AF Form 8. The flight examiner will thoroughly critique all aspects of the flight.
       During the critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific
       deviations, area/subarea grades assigned, and any additional training required.
       1.12.3.3. In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the flight examiner will determine
       additional training requirements. Required additional training may be accomplished on
       the same flight after the evaluation is complete. When used, the examinee must be
       informed when the additional training begins and ends.
1.13. Unsatisfactory Performance. See AFI 11-202V2, Chapter 5 and the following:
   1.13.1. Conduct a thorough pre-mission briefing and post-mission debriefing with the
   examinee and applicable aircrew members on all aspects of the evaluation.
   1.13.2. Immediately correct breaches of flying/patient safety or flight discipline during an
   evaluation. If this situation occurs, the flight examiner will also debrief an appropriate unit
   supervisor and if appropriate, document the deviation on an AF Form 8.
   1.13.3. Notify the examinee’s squadron commander/superintendent, if available, whenever
   less than Qualification Level ―Q-1‖ performance is observed. These debrief attendees will be
   listed on the AF Form 8 under Mission Description in the comments section.
   1.13.4. When an examinee jeopardizes safety of flight, the flight examiner may assume the
   duties of the aircrew member, if warranted. Advise the crew and assume full responsibility
   for the crew position for the rest of the mission leg. In the mobility system, evaluators will
   notify the mission execution authority immediately and coordinate follow-on action
   (replacement, if required). The evaluator should be prepared to continue follow-on missions
   if directed by the execution authority.
       1.13.4.1. This does not mean the flight examiner must assume the examinee’s position
       any time unsatisfactory performance is observed. If, in the examiner’s judgment, the
       examinee can continue safely (under supervision) the flight examiner should not assume
       the examinee’s duties.
1.14. Use of AF IMT 3862, Flight Evaluation Worksheet. Units (normally OGV) will
overprint AF IMT 3862, (see Attachment 2) and use it as an evaluation worksheet. Copy each
title, area number and text (in the order illustrated), and shading to the appropriate blocks. Units
may add special interest items and/or local evaluation requirements. Units may add the
EVALUATOR BRIEFING GUIDE. Use the worksheet to ensure all required areas are
evaluated. Record positive and negative trend information and/or aircrew member’s performance
using the ―Remarks‖ section if desired (this information is necessary when transcribing the flight
information into the Patriot Excalibur (PEX) Stan/Eval module or other MAJCOM approved
module). The AF IMT 3862 or draft copy of the AF Form 8, signed by the flight examiner, will
serve as the temporary evaluation certificate. File the certificate in the aircrew member’s Flight
Evaluation Folder (FEF) immediately after the flight evaluation as a temporary record of the
evaluation results. Maintain until the finished AF Form 8 is added to the FEF, then dispose of
properly.

1.15. Aircrew Testing. See specific testing requirements in AFI 11-202V2 and include the
following:
   1.15.1. Open-Book Exam. An open-book examination is a requisite for all QUAL/MSN
   evaluations and Universal Qualified AECMs who PCS or deploy from a flying unit with no
   C-21 mission to a unit with a C-21 mission. The open book QUAL/MSN exam will consist
   of a minimum of 100 questions and will include aircraft specific and related aircraft
   operational questions for all applicable qualification platforms. A minimum of 15 questions
   per MDS listed in paragraph 1.1.1 will be incorporated into the periodic open book
   examinations for AECMs. The questions should include but are not limited to aircraft
   systems (electrical and oxygen), emergency exits/procedures and emergency aircraft
   equipment.
   1.15.2. Closed-Book Exam. A closed-book exam is a requisite for all QUAL/MSN
   evaluations and Universal Qualified AECMs who PCS or deploy from a flying unit with no
   C-21 mission to a unit with a C-21 mission. Closed-book exam will be administered before
   initial QUAL flight evaluations and IAW AFI 11-202V2 for periodic QUAL/MSN
   evaluation. The exam will consist of a minimum of 40 questions from the Master Question
   File (MQF). The MQF will include essential nursing care standards/interventions, emergency
   medical equipment and aircrew operational procedures. These questions will emphasize
   system knowledge and information necessary for safe flight and mission accomplishment.
   Complete a Boldface exam in conjunction with closed–book exam.
   1.15.3. The following technical orders will be available for open book testing purposes: TO-
   1C-130H-1 or TO-1C-130E(H)-1 or TO-1C-130(K)H-1 or TO-1C-130J-1; TO-1C-130A-9 or
   TO-1C-130J-9, TO-1C-17A-1, TO-1C-17A-9, TO-1C-135(K)-1 and TO-1C-21A-1 (if
   applicable).
      1.15.3.1. (Added-459ARW) Testing: Testing will generally be accomplished utilizing
      the PEX system in the Standardization and Evaluation testing area. If an open book paper
      test is administered it must be done in the Standardization and Evaluation testing area
      where the member has access to the required publications.
   1.15.4. Instructor Open-Book Exam (INIT INSTR open-book exam) will be given one-time
   prior to initial instructor flight evaluation.
      1.15.4.1. The instructor open-book examination is requisite for INIT INSTR flight
      evaluations. INIT INSTR open-book examinations will have a minimum of 20 questions
      and may be derived from Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 36-2236, Guidebook for Air
      Force Instructors, AFI 11-2AE, Volumes 1, 2, and 3, and other applicable sources. The
      examinations should include scenario-driven instructor questions.
      1.15.4.2. Subsequent (periodic) and requalification (RQ) INSTR Examinations. A
      portion of the open-book examination will include instructor questions. A separate
      (unique) INSTR open-book examination is not required.
   1.15.5. Failure to Pass an Exam. AECMs who fail an open book or closed book written
   examination will fly in supervised status until a successful re-test is complete. Examinees
   who fail Boldface procedures will not be permitted to fly in their aircrew position until a
   successful re-evaluation is accomplished.
AFI11-2AEV2_459ARWSUP_I 28 January 2011                                                 13


1.16. Equivalent MDS/Model Aircraft. Consider AECMs qualified in one MDS as qualified
in all MDSs of the same design (e.g., C-130H and C-130J).
1.17. Formal Training Unit (FTU). AE does not have a dedicated FTU. All INIT QUAL/MSN
evaluations should be conducted on unit assigned MDS by unit assigned examiners. In-flight
evaluations are the AF standard for validating aircrew evaluation criteria for all types of
evaluations. Lead command (HQ AMC/A3V) will approve simulators that may supplement or
replace in-flight evaluations (currently there are no HQ AMC approved simulators for AE).
Approval for other than in-flight evaluations is HQ AMC/A3V.

2.2. Qualification/Mission Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Requalification).
   2.2.1. All initial, periodic, and requalification evaluations include all areas under
   GENERAL, QUALIFICATION and MISSION. For AECMs, the evaluation validates the
   basic capabilities of AECMs to transport and care for patients in the airborne environment.
   2.2.2. INIT QUAL/MSN. An INIT QUAL/MSN evaluation will be accomplished at the unit
   level. Upon successful completion of the INIT QUAL/MSN evaluation, the first AF Form 8
   will indicate crew position codes as ―MH‖ (mission qualified FN) or ―MA‖ (mission
   qualified AET). Expiration date for initial qualification will be based on successful
   completion of the QUAL/MSN evaluation.
   2.2.3. Periodic flight evaluations will be a QUAL/MSN evaluation. Use a single line entry
   under flight phase indicating ―QUAL/MSN‖ and date. Use separate line entries if more than
   one flight is necessary to complete the evaluation. Expiration date is based on the latest flight
   phase accomplished. Periodic evaluations include all areas under GENERAL,
   QUALIFICATION and MISSION.
       2.2.3.1. For evaluations that establish a new eligibility period (i.e., QUAL/MSN), enter
       the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which the flight phase of the
       evaluation was successfully completed.
       2.2.3.2. For evaluations that do not establish a new eligibility period, enter ―N/A.‖
   2.2.4. Re-qualification evaluations will be a QUAL/MSN evaluation. Use a single line entry
   under flight phase indicating ―RQ QUAL/MSN‖ and date. Use separate line entries if more
   than one flight is necessary to complete the evaluation. Expiration date is based on latest
   flight phase accomplished. Re-qualification evaluations include all areas under GENERAL,
   QUALIFICATION, and MISSION.
2.3. Instructor Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Requalification). AECMs selected to
establish and maintain instructor status will be evaluated on their ability to instruct using criteria
in all areas of INSTRUCTOR. Flight examiners will place particular emphasis on the examinee’s
ability to recognize student difficulties and provide timely, effective corrective action.
Examinees should be prepared to demonstrate and/or explain performance of a procedure,
operation of equipment, or a duty associated with their crew position.
   2.3.1. Initial instructor evaluations will include instructing a qualified AECM of like
   specialty or instructing a student in upgrade training. Crewmembers will not use their initial
   instructor evaluation to satisfy the requirements of a periodic evaluation. Initial instructor
   evaluations include all areas under GENERAL and INSTRUCTOR.
       2.3.1.1. Initial instructor evaluations may be administered on any aircraft listed in
       paragraph 1.1.3 After successful completion of the initial instructor evaluation on one of

   2.3.2. Periodic instructor evaluations will be administered in conjunction with required
   qualification/mission evaluations and will include all areas under GENERAL,
   QUALIFICATION, MISSION, and INSTRUCTOR.
      2.3.2.1. Periodic instructor evaluations may be administered on any aircraft listed in
      paragraph 1.1.3.
2.4. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). Evaluate an AECM’s knowledge of aircraft
emergency procedures, emergency medical procedures and emergency medical equipment
during the EPE portion of all QUAL/MSN evaluations, with scenario based questions. Use one
continuous scenario throughout the EPE and/or different scenarios for each emergency
procedure. A QUAL/MSN evaluation requires a single EPE. Document EPE, IAW AFI 11-
202V2.
   2.4.1. The EPE will cover the following areas to satisfy requirements for an initial, periodic,
   and requalification QUAL/MSN evaluation: Cardiac/Respiratory arrest and emergency
   medical equipment, emergency signals, in-flight emergencies, landing and ditching
   emergencies. Examinees should be able to demonstrate an understanding of
   Cardiac/Respiratory arrest and emergency medical equipment by ―hands-on‖ application.
   Nursing considerations may be covered during an EPE based on nursing interventions taken
   during/after an emergency.
   2.4.2. EPE areas previously graded qualified, ―Q,‖ do not need to be reevaluated during the
   flight phase of the mission, but will be, if observed.
   2.4.3. (Added-459ARW) To successfully complete an EPE, AECMs must meet the Q level
   of the criteria listed under the specific area. Examinee will demonstrate/explain appropriate
   response(s) during a cardiac/respiratory emergency scenario, including a hands-on
   demonstration in setting up suction device, handheld resuscitator/oral airway, oxygen
   delivery equipment, and use of cardiac equipment IAW with scope of practice. Boldface
   procedures will be stated from memory during the EPE scenario. Examinees are encouraged
   to use their abbreviated checklists during the emergency signals, landing, in-flight, and
   ground emergencies section of the EPE scenario.
2.5. Additional Information.
   2.5.1. Flight examiners will not conduct evaluations when scheduled as primary aircrew
   members.
   2.5.2. Instructors and flight examiners receiving periodic evaluations may be evaluated in
   any crew position, as applicable (e.g., MCD, FN, CMT, 2AET or 3AET), but do not require
   an evaluation in all positions.
   2.5.3. For AECM Universal Qualification, the following statement will be documented in
   the examiner’s remarks section of the AF Form 8 for all QUAL/MSN evaluations: ―This
   evaluation was administered on the X-XXX(aircraft type) and meets the requirements for
   universal qualification on the: C-17, C-130, and KC-135.‖ (add C-21, if applicable).
