This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance. This directive further
describes policies and operating procedures, and assigns responsibilities for the Contract Depot
Maintenance (CDM) Program at all Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) field units and
organizations within the Air Force Global Logistics Support Center (AFGLSC). The directive
does not apply to the 88 Air Base Wing (ABW), Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration
Group (AMARG), 74 Medical Group, Labs, and Product Centers, US Air Force Reserve or Air
National Guard units and members. This instruction captures the transition of CDM from the Air
Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) to the use of Operation & Maintenance (O&M) and
Materiel Support Division (MSD) direct cite funding. This instruction removes the need for
Customer Order Acceptance Lists (COAL) and the removal of references to Contractor Acquired
Property (CAP) which is no longer authorized as a material option in the CDM Program. This
instruction also removes the need for Buyer/Seller relationships as they pertain to the CDM
Direct Cite business process but does not limit ALC Combat Sustainment Wing/Aircraft
Sustainment Wings (CSW/ASW) or AFGLSC organizations from continuing to use the
designation in their day to day business operations. AFMCI 21-113, Depot Maintenance Activity
Group (DMAG), is the antecedent for this instruction. Unless otherwise specified in the body of
this directive, requests to deviate from compliance of the policies set forth in this instruction
should be sent via memorandum to HQ AFMC/A4, 4375 Chidlaw Rd, Room A135, Wright-
Patterson AFB OH 45433-5006. The memorandum must be signed by the ASW or Supply Chain
Management Wing (SCMW) commander/director and will outline the reasons why the unit
cannot comply with the existing policy. Supporting documentation to substantiate the request
should be attached to the memorandum. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual 33-363,

                                           Chapter 1

                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose.
   1.1.1. This instruction presents the policies and procedures used in planning and
   administering depot level contract maintenance programs for the following organizations:
       1.1.1.1. Sustainment Wings, Groups, and Squadrons.
       1.1.1.2. Supply Chain Management Wings (SCMW), Groups, Squadrons.
       1.1.1.3. Defense Information Systems Office (DISO).
       1.1.1.4. Air Base Wing/Logistics.
       1.1.1.5. Small Business.
       1.1.1.6. Staff Judge Advocate.
       1.1.1.7. Contracting Directorate/Competition Advocate.
       1.1.1.8. Financial Management and Comptroller.
       1.1.1.9. Defense Financial Accounting Services (DFAS).
       1.1.1.10. Safety Office.
       1.1.1.11. AFMC Commodity Councils.
       1.1.1.12. Program Group (Systems Program Manager (SPM)/Product Group Manager
       (PGM)).
   1.1.2. These procedures give guidance to obtain and manage contract coverage for depot
   level maintenance requirements, within budgetary allocations, and in preparing the
   documentation necessary for contracting and adequate material support. This guidance helps
   in selecting responsible contractors and providing adequate AFMC pre-award/post-award
   support to the contractor selected. When only an overview of functional element
   responsibilities is given, indicated references will provide detailed responsibilities.
1.2. Responsibility for Contract Performance. Maintenance placed on a contract imposes
responsibilities on the Program Group (SPM/PGM) at the Air Logistics Center (ALC) and
Contract Administration Office (CAO) as well as the repair contractor. Failure of the Program
Group (SPM/PGM) or the CAO to fulfill their obligations according to the repair contract could
cause the contractor to fail in meeting maintenance production commitments, resulting in claims
for price and delivery adjustments. Failure of the contractor to produce according to contract
terms, places increased demands on the CAO, the ALC, and AFMC. These demands on the
Program Group (SPM/PGM) may take the form of increased support assistance to the contractors
in resolving maintenance production problems, or arranging alternate sources of maintenance
production to fulfill repair requirements to meet commitments to the funding customer. The ALC
cannot place, on contract, its inherently governmental functions as defined in Circular A-76,
Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Performance of Commercial Activities.
6                                                              AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


1.3. Complexity of the Contract Depot Maintenance Program. It is necessary to recognize
the complexity of a Contract Depot Maintenance (CDM) Program. Requirements, production,
and technical functions within the SCMS/ALC Sustainment Wings, Groups, and Squadrons are
involved as are other ALC staff offices. The contracting office within each ALC directorate is
the buying activity for the CDM Program, while Defense Contract Management Agency
(DCMA) is responsible for certain post-award activities. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
Part 42, Contract Administration and Audit Services, as well as AFI 63-124, Performance Based
Services Acquisitions (PBSA), guidance is followed as it pertains to specific Contracting Officer
(CO) functions. All organizations and individuals concerned must be aware of the necessity to
establish and maintain an integrated, highly coordinated CDM Program to ensure success.
1.4. Planning for the Contract Depot Maintenance Program. Careful planning, attention to
detail and timely preparation are all essential elements of the CDM Program. Each organization
must fulfill its individual planning and preparation functions as an integral part of the overall
effort. When the planning actions are sufficiently advanced, a meeting of the organizations
involved is scheduled (ref. Chapter 5) to examine in detail the planning Purchase Request (PR)
package. The members of this forum are referred to as the Contract Repair Team (CRT). The
CRT is responsible for planning the acquisition and remains responsible for assessing contractor
performance and managing requirements over the life of the contract. The CRT ensures the PR is
adequate and establishes a coordinated position before the PR package is completed for
submission to the applicable contracting office. Formation of a CRT is required for all new
contracts and highly recommended for recurring contract delivery orders.
    1.4.1. All personnel involved in the planning, development and acquisition of applicable
    programs must comply with the requirements in FAR and other directives concerning
    disclosure of acquisition information. The disclosure of any information, which could
    prejudice competition among prospective contractors, or the negotiation position of the
    government is prohibited. The release of information to any contractor or sub-contractor with
    known foreign involvement without review and approval by the Foreign Disclosure Policy
    Office (FDPO) is prohibited (see para 1.7.5.).
    1.4.2. For purposes of this instruction, the term CRT will be considered synonymous with
    the term Multi-Functional team as identified in AFI 63-124. The goal of the PBSA is to
    design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor performance, foster
    synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or unforeseen mission needs, and leverage
    commercial best practices. These support strategies align mission performance needs with
    performance-based work statements and acquisition approaches designed to deliver the
    desired mission support results. This is to ensure adequacy and to establish a coordinated
    position of all concerned activities before the PR package is completed for submission to the
    contracting office of the SCMS/ALC Sustainment Wings, Groups, and/or Squadrons.
1.5. Contract Depot Maintenance Direct Cite Funding.
    1.5.1. Customer Depot Maintenance direct cite funds will only be utilized to finance the cost
    of depot level maintenance.
    1.5.2. Depot level maintenance includes:
       1.5.2.1. Overhaul, conversion, maintenance, modernization, modernization-conversions,
       interim re-work, modification installation, and repair of aircraft (i.e., Periodic Depot
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                   7


     Maintenance (PDM), Analytical Condition Inspection (ACI), etc.), missiles, drones,
     engines, engines accessories, Communications-Electronics (C-E) equipment, SE, Other
     Major End Items (OMEI), and reparable components. Also includes embedded software
     modification, update, revision and any manufacture of parts and assemblies required to
     support the above-mentioned items (ref. Department of Defense (DoD) 7000.14-R,
     Financial Management Regulation).
  1.5.3. The CDM Program will not use the customer's depot maintenance funds for other than
  support of depot repair activities to include:
     1.5.3.1. Acquisition of sustaining engineering tasks executed by the Single Manager's
     (SM) O&M functions.
     1.5.3.2. Acquisition or preparation of technical data, i.e., Acceptance Test Procedures
     (ATP), engineering reports, etc., directly executed by the SM O&M function. Software
     upgrade technical data and AFTO Form 349, Maintenance Data Collection Record, are
     accepted as a product of the repair process.
     1.5.3.3. Also includes services rendered by communications units/agencies, technical
     assistance, local (intermediate) maintenance assistance provided to a requesting base or
     Air Force activity, area support, base support, local manufacturer and acquisition of
     facilities.
  1.5.4. Direct Cite Funding:
     1.5.4.1. The CDM program is funded by direct citation of customer funds. Direct cite
     order funding documents are to be accepted and processed by the Production
     Management Specialist (PMS). The PMS/Materiel Manager (MM) will prepare a funding
     document to identify the workload requirement to be placed on order/contract.
     Contractual funding documents (Contractor Assistance Team (CAT) II, Military
     Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPRs), AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization,
     etc.) will not be processed through the organization holding funding authority until
     customer funding is available. PRs prepared before funds are available may be processed
     as an ―initiate only‖ document (ref. AFMCI 23-102, Purchase Request/Military
     Interdepartmental Purchase Request (PR/MIPR) Operations, for guidance on the
     preparation of PR and Cat II MIPRs).
     1.5.4.2. CDM funding for Depot Purchase Equipment Maintenance (DPEM) or MSD
     work is in current year customer dollars. Funding for actual requirements managed and
     controlled under the CDM program is dependent on the obligation of customer funds to
     include AF Form 406, Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursement Documentation
     (MORD), for Government Furnished Materiel (GFM) when applicable (ref. Chapter 3).
         1.5.4.2.1. GFM provided to the contractor must be controlled to make sure the
         contractor has sufficient material to meet production. A MORD will be used to fund
         the GFM cost portion of the Unit Repair Cost (URC) associated to a contract delivery
         order. The MORD funds ALL GFM for DPEM contracts and Budget Code (BC) 9
         GFM for MSD contracts (ref. Chapter 3). The PMS will amend the MORD based on
         actual cost of expenses versus obligations, which may result in an increase or
         decrease. Sufficient MORD funding must be obligated in advance of the incurrence
         of expenses, in order to provide potential Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA) violations or
8                                                                AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


           contractor work stoppage, should expenses exceed obligations. When applicable,
           appropriate actions to amend (increase/decrease) MORD funding must be
           accomplished prior to the expiration of customer funding.
1.6. Contracting Methods.
    1.6.1. The Air Force must craft CDM contracts in a manner that: 1) links contract incentives
    to weapon system performance outcomes, cost, and schedule 2) provides flexibility to
    achieve trade-offs to weapon system performance and their associated costs when
    programmatic budget decisions must be implemented, and 3) sustains an appropriate
    incentive structure when productivity improvements (via LEAN, Six Sigma, etc., initiatives)
    reduce CDM costs. These types of flexible CDM contracts, incorporating Performance Based
    Logistics (PBL) principles, are critical to agile combat support programs.
    1.6.2. When considering the best method for the contracting workload, it should be
    recognized that multi-year contracting reduces the effort and cost to acquire and manage
    contracts for repetitive requirements. Multi-year contracts are explained in FAR Part 17,
    Special Contracting Methods. Multi-year contracts fall within the authority of CDM and are
    based on ―no obligation to the government‖ options. Logical candidates for multi-year
    contracts are those workloads that present stable demands and possess stable configuration.
    Examples are aircraft PDM, jet engines, vehicles, landing gear, and exchangeable
    commodities. Funding of severable service contracts generally may not cross fiscal years,
    and thus must be funded with dollars available for obligation on the date the contractor
    performs the services. Multi-year contracts usually provide that performance during the out
    years is contingent upon the appropriation of funds, and provides for cancellation of
    payments if such appropriations are not made. Statutory authority is contained in Title 10
    United States Code, Section 2306(c), Kinds of Contracts.
       1.6.2.1. Second and subsequent year requirements on multi-year contracts represent
       planned requirements to be ordered, subject to customer funds availability through
       congressional budget approval. Failure to provide notification to the Primary Contracting
       Officer (PCO) of the availability of funds to cover second and subsequent year
       requirements may result in contract cancellation action.
       1.6.2.2. For MSD contracts only, carcasses may be shipped directly to the contractor
       having a multi-year contract before funding the subsequent year's increment. The
       contractor cannot begin work on the contract for second and subsequent years,
       respectively, until receiving official notification that customer funds are available. It must
       also be recognized that the contractor may incur costs associated with the care of
       government property (GFM, reparables, etc.). When the subsequent year's contract option
       is issued, the contractor will recover the cost under the provisions of the contract. If the
       contract option is not exercised, care and storage of Government Furnished Equipment
       (GFE)/GFM and reparables will be recovered if necessary as an itemized entry to, and
       recovered in the cancellation costs.
    1.6.3. Emergency or urgent contracts such as ―Not to Exceed (NTE)‖ type contracts or un-
    priced actions should only be used as a last resort. These Undefinitized Contract Actions
    (UCA) result in undefinitized prices, which require a contract modification once the actual
    cost, has been determined and negotiated. Every effort must be made to definitize contracts
    before the customer's funds expire. For example; excess funds on the contract will result in
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                       9


  loss of customer purchasing power for other mission requirements. If initial funding is
  inadequate, additional funds will need to be provided to continue the work on the contract.
     1.6.3.1. Prior to the expiration of customers‘ funds, the best estimate for labor costs will
     be made and that estimate will become the price. If work is canceled/terminated, or
     quantities are reduced, the associated funds less the cancellation/termination charges
     must be returned to the customer, even if the customer‘s appropriation has expired. This
     policy places a significant risk on the customer when contracts are not definitized by the
     time customers‘ funds expire.
  1.6.4. Title 10 U.S.C. 2410(a), Contracts for periods crossing fiscal years; severable service
  contracts; leases of real or personal property, permits DoD agencies to obligate funds
  current at the time of contract award to finance any severable service contract with a period
  of performance that does not exceed one year. This permits an agency to fund severable
  service contracts that cross fiscal years with funds current at the time of award.
  1.6.5. The DPEM office implements funding policy and procedures for the ALC (DPEM)
  program. This organization; receives, controls, distributes, and provides oversight in the
  execution of DPEM funding. SCMS/Sustainment Wings, Groups, and/or Squadrons are
  notified of their level of funding for each command by Budget Activity Code, Program
  Element Code and Element of Expense Investment Code (EEIC). This office also acts as a
  liaison between the HQ AFMC Centralized Asset Management (CAM) office and
  SCMS/Sustainment Wings, Groups and/or Squadrons. CDM funds are received from CAM
  via the Operating Budget Authority Document (OBAD); MSD funds are received via the
  Annual Operating Budget (AOB) document.
  1.6.6. Customer funded contract line item management is vested in the PR of the applicable
  SCMS/Sustainment Wings, Groups, and/or Squadrons. Complete PR packages for follow-on
  and new requirements type contracts are assembled by the PMS (ref. Chapter 2).
  1.6.7. Managing URC and Contract Management.
     1.6.7.1. The PMS acquires and retains all documentation necessary to establish and
     monitor (increase/decrease) the fully loaded Latest Repair Cost (LRC) (ref. AFMCMAN
     23-1 para 34.9)/URC estimate to include the contract costs (labor/over and above for
     programmed/unprogrammed, Contract Furnished Materiel (CFM)), award fees,
     GFE/GFM costs, and other costs associated to the repair. The PMS will continue to
     monitor contract cost estimates to reflect actual cost, while the customer funds are still
     available for obligation. Before the customer funds expire, the PMS must finalize the
     fully loaded Latest Repair Cost (LRC)/URC associated cost estimates as closely as
     possible to the actual fully loaded Latest Repair Cost (LRC)/URC. This final fully loaded
     Latest Repair Cost (LRC)/URC estimate becomes the contractual price to the customer.
     Supporting documentation must contain correspondence, which justifies each cost
     increase/decrease, and be maintained in the PMS contract folder for the life of the
     contract. If work is cancelled, or quantities are reduced, the associated funds less
     cancellation/termination charges must be returned to the customer, even if the customer‘s
     appropriation has expired. MSD customers will be treated as annual year customers
     consistent with current AFMC and DoD pricing policies. If required, the PMS shall
     obtain additional funding from the customer for all valid cost increases.
10                                                                AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


        1.6.7.2. While the PMS will properly file maintain the LRC/URC within CAV AF, the
        IMS/MM/PMS shall accomplish file maintenance using the MISTR (Management of
        Items Subject to Repair) Repair Data (MRPR) screen during the September Secondary
        Item Requirements System (SIRS) D200A comp cycle. NOTE: Within CAV AF, the
        contractor charges represent the fully loaded LRC/URC minus the associated GFM cost.
     1.6.8. The initial contract period of performance (i.e., first 60 days) should be monitored
     closely to ensure repair assets are generated as required. If assets fail to generate for repair,
     and will not generate within the first 60 days (or for any 60 consecutive day period during the
     contract), it may be necessary to contractually reduce repair quantities and de-obligate dollars
     accordingly.
        1.6.8.1. After the initial period of performance, the PMS should continue to review the
        status of asset generation for repair. In addition, the PMS should continue monitoring the
        contractor‘s performance during quarterly reviews to ensure asset repairs are IAW
        contract repair schedules.
        1.6.8.2. A contract reconciliation review by the PMS should take place a minimum of 60
        days before contract expiration. This review should focus attention on the ability of the
        government to supply reparable items and the ability of the contractor to receive and
        induct all reparable items within the period of performance of the contract/delivery order.
        The PMS must ensure the contractor receives all items for repair before the end of the
        contract/delivery order period of performance. As long as the contractor has inducted
        items for repair before the end of the contract/delivery order period of performance, the
        contractor has from the induction date plus the negotiated repair flow days to repair the
        item(s) and ship (or take appropriated condemnation action) to the appropriate Source of
        Supply (SOS).
1.7. The ALC has the following basic functions for CDM.
     1.7.1. The CDM Program Office implements policy and procedures for the overall
     management of the CDM repair program. The CDM Program also accepts executed source of
     repair requirements from weapon system program offices, and participates as a member of
     the CRT.
     1.7.2. Preparation of Solicitation. The solicitation is the basis for any resultant contract.
     Information developed at the initial CRT meeting is incorporated into the PR package and
     then used in preparing the solicitation. No changes are allowed without written notification to
     the CRT Lead, Program Manager (PM) or the Lead PMS/MM for the repair contract. All
     functional elements must ensure that the solicitation is complete, clear, and accurately
     reflects all known program requirements. A copy of each solicitation resulting from the PR
     will be provided by the PCO to the CRT Lead and the Lead PMS/MM at the time of release.
     1.7.3. Pre-Award Surveys (PAS). Basic guidance on performance of PAS is provided in
     FAR Part 9, Contractor Qualifications. This reference should be reviewed before any
     Standard Form (SF) 1403, Pre-award Survey of Prospective Contractor (General), is
     released requesting a PAS. The CO determines if a PAS is required. The request for a PAS is
     the ultimate responsibility of the PCO. However, when aware of the need, the PMS/MM, will
     request in writing that the PAS be accomplished. When disagreements exist, they will be
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                      11


  elevated to the appropriate level (ref. Attachment 5 for a Pre-award Survey format and
  checklist).
  1.7.4. Post-award Support. All commitments by the government to the contractor must be
  fulfilled. This includes furnishing of government equipment, GFM, Agency Peculiar
  Property (APP), unserviceable end items, serviceable spares, and initial technical data on a
  timely basis. It also includes providing specialized training for contractor personnel (if
  stipulated by the contract) and CAO personnel, if applicable. It is the policy of AFMC to
  concentrate on selecting capable sources and providing adequate startup times. Post-Award
  Orientation Conferences (PAOC) with the contractor will be convened by the PCO or
  Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO), to ensure contractor understanding of contract
  obligations. A Post-Award Orientation Team (PAOT) may also be necessary to provide
  technical assistance or advice in the initial startup phase. Performance plans developed pre-
  award under AFI 63-124, normally should not include the center PMS or other center
  personnel as Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP) since repairs are usually performed at the
  contractor‘s facility. Limit contract performance standards to repair quality such as frequency
  of Product Quality Deficiency Reports (PQDRs), and ensure performance plans identify the
  appropriate DCMA POC/Office for quality oversight at the contractor facility. The CAO will
  maintain regular surveillance of contractor‘s performance to ensure satisfactory progress is
  made in meeting schedules and compliance with contract specifications. When appropriate
  and as problems occur, meetings should be held with the contractor‘s top-level management
  in attempts to resolve problems. ―Cure Notices‖ and/or ―Show Cause‖ letters can be issued
  by the CO. In those cases where procedures do not result in improved contractor actions,
  default termination may be recommended. In those cases, where procedures do not result in
  adequate contract performance and default action would not be in the best interest of the
  government, it may be necessary to evaluate the contract activity. This is to determine if the
  contractor can continue performance of the contract under a revised delivery schedule or
  permit the contractor to continue performance by other means satisfactory to the
  governments (FAR 49-402, Termination of Fixed Price Contracts for Default Contracts).
  1.7.5. Foreign Disclosure Review. ALCs contemplating award of a contract or subcontract to
  a foreign contractor must first ascertain whether the complete spectrum of US government
  military information required for contract performance can be disclosed under the disclosure
  policies. All proposed disclosures to include Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Proposal
  (RFP), or award of a contract will not be made to foreign governments, their representatives,
  foreign contractors, or foreign nationals, including those holding foreign reciprocal
  clearances, until approved by the FDPO. Failure to meet this requirement could result in
  awarding contracts, which cannot be completely or adequately performed because of
  potential danger to the security of the US government, or could require costly termination.
  Commercial Asset Visibility Air Force (CAV AF) access for Foreign National (FN)
  contractors must be coordinated through HQ AFMC/A4. HQ AFMC/A4 will assume the
  responsibility to gain approval for FN access through HQ AFMC/CV (ref. AFI 33-202V1,
  Network and Computer Security).
  1.7.6. Contract Closure. To ensure timely contract/delivery order closure, the PMS, upon
  receipt of the final data reports or notification by the contractor that the contract/delivery
  order is complete, will notify the contracting personnel to begin closing actions on that
  specific contract/delivery order. Contract closure responsibilities are team activities led by
12                                                              AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


     the PMS and supported by Contracting (PK) and Financial Management (FM). The PMS is
     to ensure all URC costs and adjustments were finalized prior to the expiration of funds, all
     contractor reporting actions have occurred and disposition instruction actions completed.
     1.7.7. Responsibility for Depot Maintenance Interservice Support Agreement (DMISA)
     Performance. A DMISA is an agreement constituting a contractual obligation whereby one
     service (the agent) accomplishes depot level maintenance work for another service (the
     principal). DMISA agents perform depot level maintenance on Air Force assets. PMS
     responsibilities connected with preparation and execution of DMISA is similar to those of a
     contract. However, instead of appendices, DMISAs use 17 exhibits to describe requirements
     and taskings. DMISAs will not be tracked in CAV AF. DMISAs will be file maintained in
     the system of record Interservice Material Accounting and Control System (IMACS).
     1.7.8. Contract Repair Process (CRP). The Contract Repair guidance in Chapter 5 is
     primarily written for the PMS and to assist in meeting requirements of requisition reform for
     CDM (ref. Chapter 5).
     1.7.9. The CAV AF Reporting System is the contractual reporting system for CDM repair
     requirements and GFM receipts/issues by the contractor unless otherwise specified within
     this regulation. The CAV AF system relates a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN)/Sub-CLIN
     to a nine-character alphanumeric number that identifies the item under repair. That number
     may be a Mission Design Series (MDS), Type, Model Series (TMS), or National Item
     Identification Number (NIIN). Accurate and timely data entry is critical to the validity of
     data in the system. Contracts are to be written to ensure timely reporting requirements and
     the need to use CAV AF for production tracking and GFM management. CAV AF functions
     as the property management/Materiel Control Activity (MCA). Contractors reporting
     production and GFM status will report IAW CDRL Data Item Description (DID) (DI-
     MGMT-81634B, Commercial Asset Visibility Air Force (CAV AF)/Government Furnished
     Material Report). A CAV AF Statement of Work (SOW) will be included within the
     Performance Work Statement (PWS) or Appendix A providing general objectives in the
     reporting of end item repair and GFM reporting. IAW DoD security policy, DoDI 8520.2,
     Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Public Key (PK) Enabling, contractor access to CAV
     AF will require PKI certifications. Certifications may be obtained by consulting the
     following web address http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca.
        1.7.9.1. The PMS must consider the daily interaction between CAV AF and D035,
        AFMC Secondary Item Requirements System, for National Stock Number (NSN)
        visibility and status at contractor facilities. This requires each NSN be properly recorded
        in CAV AF for accurate asset visibility within D035. To properly record NSN level data
        in CAV AF, each End Item NSN must be listed as a separate CLIN, Sub-CLIN, or
        Exhibit Line Item (ELIN). This includes NSNs, which are part of the End Item
        Interchangeability and Suitability (I&S) group. The PMS should consider these NSN
        reporting requirements and CLIN structure when preparing the PR package.
        1.7.9.2. The PMS must consider the quarterly interaction between CAV AF and D200A,
        Requirements System, for contract and NSN level data. It is imperative to ensure accurate
        data feeds of production counts, condemnations, flow days, and cost for each NSN. The
        PMS must ensure the production and condemnation counts are not duplicated.
        Duplication may occur, when CAV AF reporting is required for NSNs with multiple
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                      13


     levels of repair (low, mid, high), Test, Teardown & Evaluation (TT&E), and Check &
     Test.
     1.7.9.3. Production tracking and materiel control will be considered when preparing DD
     Form 1423, Contract Data Requirement List (CDRL). This ensures information reported
     by the contractor will meet all the needs of the ALC. Contracts must be written to ensure
     contractors understand and comply with the requirement to report production tracking
     and GFM management in CAV AF. In the rare exception that a contractor cannot be
     contractually obligated to report data in CAV AF, the reporting responsibilities fall to the
     ALC production community.
     1.7.9.4. CAV AF is utilized to provide accurate NSN level data to internal asset tracking
     and requirements systems. It is the responsibility of the PMS to ensure accurate NSN
     status (condition code and quantity on hand) is maintained daily by repair contractors. In
     addition, it is the responsibility of the PMS to ensure accurate NSN level data for
     production counts and repair costs are maintained and for quarterly system interfaces
     from CAV AF IAW local guidance.
     1.7.9.5. Interchangeability and Suitability (I&S). For CAV AF to transmit accurate end
     item asset visibility to D035 and production data D200A, the contractor must submit
     timely CAV AF transactions by the actual NSN of each asset. Thus, each end item NSN
     must be listed in CAV AF which requires a one-to-one relationship between CLIN and
     NSN. End items with I&S grouped NSNs must have a separate CAV AF reporting CLIN,
     Sub-CLIN, or ELIN for each NSN. A separate CAV AF reporting exhibit may be
     required to properly identify and associate each CLIN, sub-CLIN, or ELIN to an NSN.
     1.7.9.6. Test, Teardown & Evaluation (TT&E). Items which require multiple repair
     actions such as TT&E or Check & Test along with actual repair may have multiple
     CLINs listed on the delivery order. However, listing each CLIN for these multiple repair
     actions in CAV AF may cause duplicate production counts to be inadvertently recorded
     for the same asset. Thus, the PMS should request the cost of TT&E or Check & Test be
     incorporated as part of the negotiated repair cost for the assembly requiring such an
     action within the PR package.
        1.7.9.6.1. If TT&E and Check & Test CLINs are priced separately, they should have
        corresponding repair CLINs on the same contract delivery order. For contractor
        reporting purposes in CAV AF, only the repair CLIN will be loaded in CAV AF for
        each NSN. The contractor will be directed to receipt actual NSNs under the
        appropriate CLIN for the specific delivery order regardless of repair action. In this
        case CAV AF will be utilized for accurate asset visibility without duplication. It is the
        responsibility of the PMS to maintain actual repair cost to include cost of TT&E or
        Check & Test within CAV AF.
        1.7.9.6.2. If TT&E or Check & Test CLINs are listed on a separate delivery order
        with no corresponding repair CLINs, they can be loaded into CAV AF for contractor
        reporting. It is the responsibility of the PMS to provide actual (adjusted to include
        repair, TT&E, and Check & Test costs) repair costs for each NSN to the appropriate
        MM and file maintain as necessary.
14                                                             AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


        1.7.9.7. Low, Medium, & High Levels of Repair. It is the responsibility of the PMS to
        understand the purpose and process of multiple levels of repair to ensure accurate
        visibility and non-duplication of assets in the repair process. CLIN structure for CAV AF
        reporting must be considered when the PR package is submitted for award. Items which
        have multiple levels of repair priced separately can be loaded into CAV AF. Items priced
        separately and reported in CAV AF under different CLINs will be reported to D200A
        quarterly. D200A will average the cost of repair for each item.
        1.7.9.8. When the components of the end item being repaired are also being repaired or
        manufactured in support of a contract, the CM will ensure a separate CLIN or repair
        contract has been awarded and recorded in CAV AF to accomplish the repairs.
     1.7.10. Contractor Flow Days Documentation. The Contract Manager/PMS will identify the
     source of negotiated flow days for repair items agreed upon with the repair contractor. For
     example, negotiated flow days can be derived from historical record from previous contracts
     (for the same/similar item), industry standards, or organic depot records (for the same or
     similar item). Maintain the agreed upon flow days and source with the repair contract.
     Compare the negotiated repair flow days to the average CLIN/NIIN repair flow days
     quarterly to ensure items are repaired as agreed upon in the repair contract. Average
     CLIN/NIIN flow day data can be found in CAV AF for each item repaired via the Repair
     Turn Around Time (RTAT) reports or the CAV AF Weekly End Item report posted on the
     CDM Community of Practice (CoP). Document the quarterly flow day review in the contract
     folder.

                                          Chapter 2

         PREPARATION FOR CONTRACT DEPOT LEVEL MAINTENANCE

2.1. Purpose.
   2.1.1. This chapter covers those actions required primarily within the ALC
   SCMS/Sustainment Wings, Groups, and Squadrons leading up to the CRT meeting. Careful
   preparation during this planning phase can prevent or minimize problems in later stages of
   the contract process. The SPM conducts the annual system reviews of Air Force maintenance
   requirements and programs (exchangeable requirements are governed by AFMCI 23-105,
   Consumable Item Requirements Determination). System reviews are normally required for
   aircraft and engine programs. The SPM should be involved in all depot maintenance business
   planning processes and have proper representation at all planning functions. Application of
   this chapter to other programs is determined based on the dollar value of the program and
   complexity of the maintenance required.
2.2. Depot Maintenance Business Plan ((DMBP) Workloading).
   2.2.1. Establishes a formal plan with specific strategies to ensure depot maintenance repair
   capability is balanced. DMBP decisions balance the command‘s peacetime and wartime
   workloads to provide the Air Force with worldwide peacetime readiness and wartime
   sustainability to support the combat forces. Any program that will generate depot
   maintenance workload must be processed through DMBP for review, recommendation, and
   Source of Repair (SOR) approval. The basic elements of the DMBP process are: Depot
   maintenance requirements determination, AFI 63-101, Operations of Capabilities Based
   Acquisition System, Capability determination, Analysis of balance between workload and
   capability, Development of the business plan and the Decision process.
   2.2.2. Workload Conferences. Workload conferences are held for aircraft Modification
   (MOD)/PDM, aircraft engine, and C-E programs. Workload conferences for other programs
   may be held as necessary. The purpose of this conference is to plan, coordinate, and negotiate
   the depot level maintenance to be contracted. Organizational and intermediate level
   maintenance may be included through negotiation to the extent allowed by Technical Order
   (TO) 00-25-4, Depot Maintenance of Aerospace Vehicles and Training Equipment. Total
   agreement must be achieved by all agencies to ensure proper and complete performance
   requirements. Workload conferences should produce a workload agreement, which is
   complete, properly documented, and coordinated with each agency involved. The formal
   workload agreement provides the basis for inputs to those logistics reports which provide
   basic data to complete Appendix A (Work Specification), Appendix B (Supply Information),
   and Appendix C (Safety). A workload conference will be held when depot-level workloads
   require planning, coordination, or negotiations between the SPM, PMS, Item Management
   Specialist (IMS), Depot Level Contracting (D/PK), Technology Repair Centers (TRC), and
   using commands. The Production Management Office has primary responsibility for
   workload conference initiation and negotiations with using commands. This responsibility
   includes establishing the conference, preparing an agenda, and extending invitations to all
   activities involved. The conference will include the using leads, contracting activity,
   supporting service engineering organizations, the PM, Inventory Manager (IM) and the
16                                                              AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


     servicing ABW Logistics Function. The type and extent of negotiations required for different
     workloads vary. The nature of the workload will determine which activities should be
     requested to send representatives to the conference. Representatives from base activities and
     various offices at the prime ALCs, such as quality control or safety, may be required to
     attend. Invitations should be extended 14 days before the scheduled conference (30 days
     prior for overseas). An agenda will accompany the invitation. The agenda will be developed
     following the standard format for workload agreements.
     2.2.3. Negotiated requirements are input to the Maintenance Planning & Execution (MP&E)
     system, by program, subprogram, Repair Group Category (RGC), repair facility, etc.
     2.2.4. SPM/PGM Requirements Determination Process. Requirements will be documented,
     coordinated, prioritized and published IAW the HQ AFMC/A4F Logistics Requirement
     Determination Process guide http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/.
2.3. Requirements Reform Process.
     2.3.1. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, Installations and Mission Support,
     Headquarters U.S. Air Force, implemented the Expeditionary Logistics for the 21st Century
     transformation campaign that established a 10% cost reduction target to be met by FY11.
     One of the ways to achieve this cost reduction goal is to centralize management and
     execution of logistics sustainment funding. This concept is known as CAM. The Deputy
     Chief of Staff for Logistics, Installations and Mission Support, as the process owner, tasked
     the AFMC CAM Program Office to develop and manage this program using the following
     four main pillars: centralized sustainment funding, logistics requirements determination,
     PBL, and integrated wholesale supply and depot maintenance operations.
     2.3.2. The logistics requirements determination pillar of the CAM Program documents the
     concepts to reform the requirements generation processes across eleven business areas. This
     Logistics Requirements Determination Process is simplified, integrated, standardized and
     repeatable, and allows for trade-offs (optimization) at the United States Air Force level vice
     at the Major Command (MAJCOM) level. The results of the logistics requirements
     determination process are validated and prioritized Air Force sustainment requirements.
     2.3.3. Using the lead command concept IAW AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and
     Responsibilities for Weapon Systems, the logistics requirements determination process
     identifies and prioritizes requirements needed to achieve weapon system
     availability/capability targets required by the warfighter. AFMC is lead command for
     requirements that are considered common (i.e. not tied to a specific weapon system).
        2.3.3.1. These validated and prioritized Air Force sustainment requirements are used as
        an input to the consolidated AFMC Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and other
        processes embedded in the Air Force Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution
        (PPBE) being developed in the CAM Program Office.
2.4. Revolving Fund, Air Force Supply Management Activity Group (SMAG), MSD.
     2.4.1. A MSD budget data call letter is issued by HQ AFMC/FMR in April or May with
     ALC input due by July. The ALC budget is the first point in the Program Budget Review
     (PBR) process where requirements are balanced with available funding. MSD sales
     projections are prepared by HQ AFMC/FMR after receipt of customer budget data. MSD
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                        17


   sales projections, which drive the PBR requirements, are based on historical data, anticipated
   program changes (i.e., flying hours), and customer input. Particular attention is paid to the
   largest MSD customers. It is essential that MSD sales are balanced with customer accounts
   since MSD can only sell to the same level the MSD customers are funded. The MSD PBR is
   prepared between July and September. The customer budgets projected MSD sales and
   financial management reports are used in formulating the PBR. The PBR is forwarded to
   SAF for review and revision before submittal to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of
   Defense (OASD). OASD official approval usually occurs in November. The PBR is then
   updated to include approved funding levels and becomes the President‘s Budget. Funding is
   allocated to the ALCs based on the budgets submitted the previous July.
2.5. Contract Repair Management System (CRMS).
   2.5.1. The CRMS will provide the ALCs with a comprehensive process management tool.
   As a unified management tool for the ALCs, CRMS will provide supply chain personnel with
   management and visibility into the contract repair processes to view forecasted requirements
   and determine how they are being fulfilled.
   2.5.2. CRMS has three primary functions:
      2.5.2.1. CRMS may be used as an enhancement tool in determining repair requirements.
      It provides optimization of contract repair ordering, to include funds constraint
      management. CRMS computes the optimum repair order quantity in consideration of the
      Quarterly Demand Rate (QDR), Back Order (BO) (and BO levels), world-wide asset
      availability including reparable assets, carcass availability, funded/unproduced,
      EXPRESS Planning Module (EPM) and funding constraint.
      2.5.2.2. CRMS provides various analysis capabilities designed to detect and notify
      contract management personnel of potential contract impacts, lead time in advance.
      Notifications include, but are not limited to, contract expiration, option year expiration,
      schedule delinquencies and inadequate schedules. The impact detection is designed to
      provide personnel adequate notification so action can be taken to avoid a lapse in contract
      coverage and ensure on-time delivery.
      2.5.2.3. CRMS provides delivery schedule tracking capability to compute and track
      repair due-in ―contract‖ delivery schedules. The contract due-in delivery schedule will
      receive data from Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS)
      DD250/Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) data to compute on time delivery performance.
      This information is essential to support the needs of the warfighter and provide the
      Supplier Relationship Management office the means of tracking contractor performance
      metrics.
2.6. Customer Funding.
   2.6.1. The customer determines requirements and provides financial obligation and
   programming authority to order work through the CDM program.
      2.6.1.1. Customer funds are committed for contractual work through the PR process.
      2.6.1.2. If there is a change in contract scope that will impact the completion of the
      contract (additional requirements – increased cost or reducing the contractual
      requirements – reducing costs) then the customer must decide if it is in the best interest of
18                                                               AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


        the government to modify the current contract or terminate the current contract/task
        (delivery) order and renegotiate a new contract/task (delivery) order. As requirements
        change due to changes in work specifications, unscheduled maintenance, etc., it may be
        necessary to add, change, or reprogram workloads.
     2.6.2. CDM funds are received from each customer via the OBAD; MSD funds are received
     via the AOB document. The ALC Financial Management Office is responsible to load the
     customer funds into the financial systems. Validation of funds availability will be
     accomplished by the Materiel Sustainment Group DPEM office for O&M and the MSD
     Program Office by verifying that the funds are loaded in H069 (GAFS-R BQ).
     2.6.3. CDM customer funds are obligated once the contract/task (delivery) order has been
     executed by the PCO.
     2.6.4. When a customer‘s order is canceled or quantities are reduced, funds should not be
     returned until the contract modification has been accepted by the contractor, and
     termination/cancellation charges, if applicable, have been determined. Charges for costs due
     to total cancellation or reductions in quantities of previously negotiated workload are
     reasonable expenses which must be paid by the customer who negotiated, but then canceled
     the workload. The cancellation or quantity reduction should be processed prior to expiration
     of funds. However, the funds should be returned to the customer even if the customer‘s
     appropriation has expired.
     2.6.5. If the customer requests work to be performed that is in addition to the work originally
     negotiated, additional funding must be obtained from the customer before the work is added
     to the contract.
     2.6.6. The customer must approve additional funding for work that may be needed but was
     not negotiated and is discovered during the repair process. This approval and additional
     funding is required before authorizing the contractor to perform additional work.
     2.6.7. Change in Scope. Changes in major work content or major work specifications that
     are made after the initial contract has been negotiated are valid reasons to renegotiate the
     price with the customer. Valid reasons for price renegotiation include: the repair process is
     altered due to engineering changes, customer driven requirements to improve the quality of a
     product, changes in the cost of material required due to the amount or different kinds of
     material, and changes in cost required by the contractor to implement the work specification.
     Existing contract modification procedures should be used and the customer must provide
     approval of the renegotiated contract price prior to finalization of the modification. The
     revised prices to the customer may only be used for workload accomplished after the price
     has been renegotiated with the contractor. Changes in major work content or work
     specifications which increase the cost must be funded by the customer with funds currently
     available for new obligations. Changes in major work content or work specifications which
     decrease the cost should result in price decreases to the customer. Funds availability due to
     price decreases must be returned to the customer, even if the customer‘s appropriation has
     expired.
     2.6.8. Over and Above (O&A). The goal of the depot maintenance contract is to produce
     complete and usable end items, but there is usually work that cannot be specified in detail,
     commonly referred to as known unknowns. An O&A CLIN tasks the contractor to identify
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                       19


   needed repairs and recommend corrective action during the contract performance. The O&A
   CLIN is an estimate of the work which will be discovered during the course of repair process
   and necessary to satisfactorily complete the repair. The estimate is an ‗engineered estimate‘
   normally based on historical information. When there is no history, the information from the
   first articles will be used to revise the estimate. If the new estimate impacts schedule; the
   delivery schedules and funding profile may have to be adjusted. When O&A significantly
   exceeds the CLIN estimate (the number of hours used to establish the amount of O&A is a
   good baseline to use), it is outside the scope of the contract and will require a contract
   modification using current year funds. Since the O&A work is tied to an end item, there may
   be a need for multiple O&A CLINs in order to correctly associate the O&A work to the right
   end item.
      2.6.8.1. O&A is not a blank check to cover all unexpected activities required to complete
      the contract. O&A should be a labor rate with a material and program management
      overhead. If direct material is needed, it is not an O&A line. O&A is especially
      susceptible to abuse. Reviews must be conducted and documented in the
      contract/delivery order folder to ensure the contractor is not charging work as O&A when
      its part of a defined maintenance action. The review will also be used to determine if a
      maintenance action becomes common and needs to be a defined maintenance action; the
      contract will be modified in this case to document the item on a separate CLIN (ref.
      DFARS Clause 252.217-7028).
      2.6.8.2. The contractor will prepare a work request to identify the type of discrepancy
      disclosed, the specific location of the discrepancy, and the estimated labor hours/material
      required to correct the discrepancy. Data shall be sufficient to satisfy contract
      requirements and obtain the authorization of the CO to perform the proposed work. The
      PMS will be cognizant of the O&A scope of work and funding requirements. Authority
      for the scope of work will be made by the program office which has engineering
      authority. The PMS is not authorized to obligate funds designated for another end item to
      fund O&A work. To do so, could create an adverse impact on the total funding program
      by leaving shortfalls in customer funding. Furthermore, before awarding contract task
      (delivery) orders or contract modifications which contain an O&A CLIN, the PMS must
      receive approval for the funding of the dollar value of the O&A CLIN.
2.7. Requirement Coordination with Commodity Council and Contracting Activity.
   2.7.1. The PMS will initiate the repair acquisition PR by interrogating the Commodity
   Council Database to determine if the NIINs being considered for repair currently exist on a
   Strategic Contract or are being considered for a future Strategic Contract already under
   development. The PR should be annotated in the Remarks Field that the NIINs were not
   found in the Commodity Council Database.
   2.7.2. Prior to initiating a repair acquisition, the PMS will notify the commodity council,
   contracting activity and the competition advocate of the intention to place a new or large
   workload on contract. This notification will allow all activities to begin advance preparations
   for the contract. Using the CRT concept, the commodity council, contracting function, and
   the SCMS/Sustainment Wings, Groups, and Squadron production management function will
   jointly prepare for, award, and support the contract.
2.8. Purchase Request (PR) and Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR).
20                                                              AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


     2.8.1. The Lead PMS will prepare PRs for contract repair services or prepare a MIPR for
     maintenance accomplished by another DoD agency according to AFMCI 23-102. Effective
     December 2007, Spiral I of the PRPS/D203, Purchase Request Process System, was
     implemented for PRs, MIPRs, and Delivery Order Requests (DORs) processing. PRPS is
     being implemented in a spiral release approach and will be fully functional in December
     2008. PRPS will be the mandatory repository for logistics historical information related to an
     item and its screenings, attachments, buy requirements, financial authorizations,
     certifications, and amendments. The goal of PRPS is to decrease the cycle time associated
     with future acquisitions. AFMCI 23-102 is currently being rewritten to include PRPS
     processes.
     2.8.2. The PR or MIPR will be completed in order to detail the services ordered on the
     attachments. The PR or MIPR will reflect CDM funds and use the appropriate customer
     direct citation fund code for all O&M requested.
     2.8.3. Where more than one contract is awarded from a single PR, the PMS will amend the
     PR and all appendices before adjusting the dollar value of labor allocated to each contract.
     All contract repair delivery orders will be tracked at the 17 digit level in CAV AF.
     2.8.4. Each end item will be separately identified on the PR/MIPR so the contract can
     provide for line item identification, i.e., MOD and PDM will require separate CLINs. Each
     PR/MIPR and amendment should include a desired Scheduled in Quantity (SIQ). When there
     are changes to the SIQ or delivery schedule, the PMS will review for appropriate contractual
     actions. If the repair PR is to be managed in CAV AF, the PMS must ensure that each line
     item is applicable to a single Product Control Number (PCN). This is required for the CAV
     AF system to relate to a CLIN.
     2.8.5. The PMS must ensure PRs are prepared for each order against an Indefinite Delivery
     Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) order and are treated as a separate contract and maintained at the
     17 digit level within CAV AF.
     2.8.6. When a PR is prepared by a PMS to procure a Contract Field Team (CFT), refer to
     AFMCI 21-141, Contract Field Team (CFT) Program. CFT contract files will be manually
     maintained by the responsible PMS and not in CAV AF.
     2.8.7. For National Security System (NSS) software, the submitted PR must have all
     required documentation, including the Engineering Assignment (EA). The PR must cite
     software ―upgrade‖, ―modification‖ or ―maintenance‖. If an upgrade or modification,
     Research, Testing, Development and Evaluation (RTD&E) funds must be used; if
     maintenance, O&M type funds must be used. CAV AF will not be utilized for contract
     delivery order CLINs for software.
2.9. Accumulation and Review of Data for PR Package (New or Follow-on Requirements).
     2.9.1. The CRT, with oversight/management from the PMS, has the ultimate responsibility
     for accumulating documentation for inclusion in the PR package. Refer to AFMCI 23-102 for
     specific information relating to the PR package.
     2.9.2. The PMS will develop a Performance Work Statement (PWS) or Appendix A which
     provides instructions for accomplishing the work requirements of the weapon system or an
     end item under contract. It will include a complete list of all current TOs, Time Compliance
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                      21


  Technical Orders (TCTO), military specifications and standards, drawings, engineering data,
  and any other necessary technical data to include technical publications concerning cleaning,
  corrosion treatment, overhaul and maintenance, and other special work requirements. The
  PWS or Appendix A must address export control limitations and contain one of the following
  statements: ―Foreign Disclosure Restrictions do apply.‖ or ―Foreign Disclosure Restrictions
  do not apply.‖ The PWS or Appendix A is forwarded to responsible activities for review and
  comment prior to the CRT meeting. The PWS or Appendix A will be stored in D203 PRPS
  and will become part of the PR package.
     2.9.2.1. The applicable Equipment Specialist (ES) and Engineer reviews Appendix A to
     ensure technical data requirements are included and are accurate.
     2.9.2.2. The Purchasing Office will furnish specifications for inclusion with the
     solicitation when directed by FAR Part 10, Market Research. The solicitation should
     identify the responsible individual‘s name, title, location, office symbol and telephone
     number. Since competitive acquisition is preferred; timely evaluation and collection of
     acquisition data is essential. Normally, 60 days is allowed to obtain data for the technical
     data package but it may be necessary to expedite delivery to meet contract requirements.
     Failure to assemble an accurate and complete technical data package can hinder the
     development of a competitive acquisition program.
     2.9.2.3. The applicable technical representative; engineer, engineer workload manager
     or ES can initiate or work a Quality Assurance/Inspection Requirements activity in D203
     PRPS for quality assurance and make sure they are identified in the work specifications.
     2.9.2.4. The Corrosion Control Office or Group Level Cognizant Engineering Authority
     (CEA) will determine the requirements for corrosion control and ensure they are
     identified in work specifications.
  2.9.3. The PR Initiator must ensure Appendix B, Supply Information, is prepared IAW
  Chapter 3 of this instruction. The responsible ES will provide a list of authorized stock
  numbers required as GFM (i.e., Materiel Requirements Listing (MRL)/Purchase Request
  Support List (PRSL)). This document should be attached to the Appendix B activity. It
  should be specific in order to obtain required material and services in a manner most
  advantageous to the government.
  2.9.4. Safety requirements will be included in Appendix C. The Safety Office will provide
  safety requirements tailored to the specific PR being reviewed and a listing of applicable
  publications. Upon completion of the Appendix A, the PMS will furnish a copy via a manual
  location change in D203 PRPS to the Safety Specialist which will contain the specific PR
  number and request Appendix C have the same file number. Note: All appendices pages must
  be annotated with the number in the foot notes of each page.
  2.9.5. The preparation and development of the Data Item and a DD Form 1423 (CDRL) is
  IAW DoD 5010.12-M, Procedures for the Acquisition and Management of Technical Data
  and MIL-STD-963B, Data Item Descriptions (DIDs). DD Form 1423 is the standard format
  for identifying potential data requirements in a solicitation and deliverable data requirements
  in a contract, with the exception of those cases described in Defense Acquisition
  Management Policies and Procedures. The three CDRL options are DD Form 1423, DD
  Form 1423-1, Contract Data Requirements List (1 Data Item) and DD Form 1423-2,
22                                                               AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


     Contract Data Requirements List (2 Data Items). The CDRL provides the delivery
     instructions for the technical data and instructions for eliminating unnecessary DID
     requirements. The CDRL, when made part of the solicitation, shall include every known and
     anticipated data requirement. A Data Item is the deliverable data that the contractor prepares
     to satisfy the Government's requirements. The DID is a document that defines the purpose of,
     intended use of, data content of, general format of, and preparation instructions for data
     requirements. Each DID for data to be purchased on a contract is listed on a CDRL.
        2.9.5.1. Contract data call letters will be sent to all affected support activities. The data
        call letters should include enough information to allow the support activities to determine
        their data requirements and provide their DD Form 1423 inputs.
        2.9.5.2. The Data Management Office (DMO) is responsible to consolidate the CDRL
        into the completed copy of the DD Form 1423. The DMO will be designated in writing
        by their program office flight chief and may be assigned for all or specifically identified
        DD Form 1423(s). Responsibilities are to include maintaining and keeping abreast with
        current revisions to applicable DID and their association with execution strategy of the
        CRT PR work package. The DMO/PMS will ensure CAV AF contractor reporting
        requirements are met.
     2.9.6. The ES or Engineer will definitize ACI requirements and the exhibits necessary for
     peculiar engineering contractor support and contractor accomplishment of certain
     engineering tasks in support of the PDM. Peculiar engineering services (i.e., EEIC 583) must
     be listed as a separate CLIN and be funded with engineering service funds.
     2.9.7. If work requirements are classified PM (Logistics Management Specialist) and ES can
     initiate, work and complete in D203 PRPS, Contract Security Classification Specification.
     The completed form must be coordinated and approved with the appropriate Industrial
     Security Specialist.
     2.9.8. For contract performance accomplished outside the continental United States, the ES,
     Engineer or the PMS, will complete AFMC Form 191, Foreign Disclosure Procurement
     Decision Worksheet, and coordinate with the FDPO.
     2.9.9. The ES or Engineer will initiate an AFMC Form 807, Recommended Quality
     Assurance Provisions and Special Inspection Requirements, to provide the Ozone Depleting
     Chemical/Ozone Depleting Substance (ODC/ODS) Certification. If a waiver is required, the
     appropriate waiver field will be checked and the waiver letter will be completed by the
     Engineer and will be forwarded to Air Staff for approval. Upon receipt of Air Staff approval,
     the letter will be forwarded with the PR package.
     2.9.10. Include the following in the PR package if applicable to the requested workload (ref.
     AFMCI 23-102.
        2.9.10.1. Length of required contract period.
        2.9.10.2. A production schedule to meet Air Force requirements to be placed on contract.
        Requirements reflect a 12-month schedule of aircraft, engine and other maintenance for
        which the ALC is responsible and also provide a 12-month schedule of required
        equipment (firm or estimated). The production schedule is based on only one criterion
        such as number of flow days, specific calendar dates, or total aircraft per month. In no
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                       23


     case will the delivery schedule be stated as ―based on receipt of GFM/GFE‖ or ―based on
     parts supportability.‖ The production schedule will allow a reasonable time for delivery
     of the first unit. A reasonable learning curve is applied for the buildup to peak
     production. In the absence of military necessity, sharp peaks and valleys in monthly
     output will not be scheduled.
     2.9.10.3. The following must be considered when developing a comprehensive delivery
     schedule for competitive contracts:
        2.9.10.3.1. Production from an incumbent contractor (including what is required as
        production overlap).
        2.9.10.3.2. Estimated date of award to a new source allowing adequate time between
        contract award date and first production.
        2.9.10.3.3. The need for phased aircraft/engine/commodities input after contract
        award or phased startup of new work (MODs/TCTOs) added to an in-progress
        contract when the work requires kits, tooling, test equipment, new skills or an
        increase in contractor manning. As a general rule, initial input for production to a new
        contractor, or new workload to an existing contractor, will not be scheduled for 90
        days after contract award or from date of contract modification, nor scheduled for
        output sooner than 120 days after input. The intent is to allow the contractor sufficient
        time to gear up. Thereafter, delivery schedules will be in line with Air Force
        requirements.
     2.9.10.4. Appendix B property provisions will be reviewed by the PR Initiator to ensure
     property is properly categorized, that proper contract provisions are included, and that
     facility items are excluded, except for those which project approval has been obtained.
     The contractor shall furnish all facilities except as outlined in FAR Part 45.302-1,
     Authorizing the Use of and Rental of Government Property. Specify if special
     consideration has been given to the identification of Industrial Plant Equipment (IPE),
     Units Under Test (UUT) sets, or Special Tooling (ST)/Special Test Equipment (STE) to
     be furnished to the contractor. In general, it is the policy of the DoD that only those items
     which are high cost, have only military application, and are not readily available from
     commercial sources, will be furnished by the government. No item of IPE, UUT, or
     ST/STE will be furnished to any contractor unless properly identified in Appendix B (ref.
     Chapter 3).
     2.9.10.5. Justification and approval for other than full and open competition is addressed
     in FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. FAR Part 6 prescribes policies and procedures
     to promote full and open competition in the acquisition process and to provide for full
     and open competition, full and open competition after exclusion of sources, other than
     full and open competition, and competition advocates. This part does not deal with the
     results of competition (e.g., adequate price competition), which are addressed in other
     parts (e.g., Part 15).
     2.9.10.6. Defense priorities and allocations are addressed in FAR Part 11.6, Describing
     Agency Needs – Priorities and Allocations, and in AFI 63-602, Defense Production Act
     Title 1–Defense Priorities and Allocations System.
24                                                              AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


        2.9.10.7. Requirement for Security. If the PR or any attachments are classified or work to
        be performed is classified. Attach DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification
        Specification, Department of Defense, to the PR.
        2.9.10.8. The PMS will verify with the ES to determine if there is a requirement for a
        Value Engineering (VE) clause(s) and if there are active VE royalties. State the
        appropriate VE requirements with the PR package.
        2.9.10.9. Demonstration of Responsibility Clause. This requirement was developed to
        deter marginal producers or sources with limited capability from expending their time
        and money to submit bids and proposals. Information furnished in response to this clause
        provides the CO additional factors to be evaluated during PAS. When source selection
        procedures are not used, it is recommended that the clause be used in areas where poorly
        qualified contractors have been a problem.
        2.9.10.10. Initial Production Evaluation is addressed in AFMCI 23-102, PAS in FAR
        Part 9.106, Pre-award Surveys and FAR Part 42.500, Post-award Orientation.
        2.9.10.11. In the Remarks Field of the PR, make the following statement: ―required
        appendices are attached and the DD Form 1423, and all data (TOs, manuals and
        regulations, etc.,) referred to therein and required for contractor accomplishment of work
        requirements, are available for review by prospective bidders.‖
        2.9.10.12. Provide justification for urgent packages, as necessary, IAW AFMCI 23-102.
        2.9.10.13. Identify and include any physical security requirements for sensitive
        conventional arms, ammunition and explosives. Attach the information to the PR
        package.
        2.9.10.14. The PR Initiator will annotate the PR as required by AFMCI 23-102, i.e.,
        Potential ―GFE,‖ ―Demilitarization – DMIL‖, or ―Classified Items.‖
        2.9.10.15. In the Remarks Field, the PR Initiator will annotate the acquisition plan
        number (FAR Part 7, Acquisition Planning).
        2.9.10.16. If applicable, the Remarks Field should contain an appropriate statement for
        the Contractor Communications Network (CCN).
        2.9.10.17. Surge in Contract Production Clause. Contractors performing repair activities
        must have provisions to meet contingency requirements by increasing production.
        Particular care should be taken when writing contracts for mission critical workload to
        allow responsive surge production by contractors. Once surge operations are
        implemented and high demand items are identified as contract items, the PMS will notify
        the contractor to implement their contract surge clause. The contracting office will
        execute the surge clause to meet the contingency requirements. If there is no surge clause,
        the CO will negotiate one into existing contracts or negotiate a new contract to meet
        surge requirements.
        2.9.10.18. Incentive/Performance Contracts. Specific information related to incentive
        and performance based contracts can be found in FAR Part 16, Types of Contracts.
     2.9.11. Any other appendices required will be prepared by the applicable PMS or
     appropriate CRT member.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                     25


   2.9.12. Include requirement for Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP)
   reporting.
2.10. Consolidate Data into Complete New or Follow-on PR Requirement Package.
   2.10.1. The PR Initiator or designee will assemble the PR and its associated documents,
   called the PR package for new or follow-on requirements. The PR package will contain, as a
   minimum, the following:
   2.10.2. A complete and accurate PR (AFMC Form 36, Purchase Request).
   2.10.3. Current Appendices (―A,‖ ―B,‖ ―C,‖ etc.) with each page having either the PR or file
   number annotated in the foot notes for continuity.
   2.10.4. DD Form 1423.
       2.10.4.1. Air Force policy on the acquisition of contractor prepared data is contained in
       DoDI 5000, Defense Acquisition Guidebook.
       2.10.4.2. Only the data which is essential to the effective support of the Air Force
       mission or to the management of an Air Force program will be procured from a
       contractor.
       2.10.4.3. The CDRL is an exhibit to a contract and is incorporated as a line item in the
       schedule (ref. DoD 5000.2). The CDRL lists all data requirements of the contract and is
       the only contractual authority for delivery of data. Personnel engaged in contract
       maintenance programs must be familiar with DoD 5000.2, so the essential data
       requirements are included in the maintenance contracts.
   2.10.5. Justification and Approval (J&A) (if applicable). Technical and Requirements
   Specialists and Engineers are responsible for providing and certifying accurate, complete and
   necessary data.
2.10.6 Citing Transportation Funds. The appropriate transportation funds must be on the
PR/MIPR or on the attached DD Form 1653, Transportation Data for Solicitations, when
processed by contracting for inclusion in section G of the contract or modification.
Transportation funds for each customer are:
       2.10.6.1. Other components (Navy, Army, National Guard, etc.). The correct
       Transportation Account Code (TAC)/ Army Tank Automotive Command (ATAC) Center
       are identified on the original DMISA or the funding MIPR.
       2.10.6.2. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) repair. The transportation funding is provided on
       the FMS case.
       2.10.6.3. Air Force Repair. The TAC/ATAC is supplied by the Transportation office on
       the DD Form 1653.
2.11. Coordination Cycle for New or Follow-on PR Packages.
   2.11.1. The PR is signed at appropriate organizational levels.
       2.11.1.1. The PR Initiator will ensure that the CRT Lead reviews the PR package for
       compliance with CRT minutes and coordinates/signs the PR prior to organizational
26                                                                AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


        signature level. The CRT Lead or designee must certify follow on PRs in support of a
        delivery order to ensure they are IAW CRT minutes for the basic contract.
        2.11.1.2. The funded PR should be processed through the CO for funds certification. The
        PR/MIPR receives funds certification through the organization having the funding
        authority for the ALC. The applicable resource advisor coordinates on the PR package to
        certify that funds are available. The PR package is then forwarded to PR/MIPR control
        and then to ALC/FM for certification of funds. Note: Under D203, the PR coordination
        process will be accomplished in the system.
     2.11.2. Upon receipt of the PR package, contracting will negotiate a contract to provide
     requested services. Approved customer funding may be required on some types of contracts
     before contract/delivery order award. Contracting will distribute contracts IAW local ALC
     policy.
     2.11.3. Upon receipt of a signed copy of the contract or acceptance of the MIPR by another
     DoD agency, DFAS posts the obligation of funds in the H069 GAFS/BQ system.
     2.11.4. Upon receipt of a signed copy of the contract or acceptance of the MIPR by another
     DoD or government agency, the PR Initiator provides the applicable repair record to the
     contract monitor. The contract monitor then inputs the delivery order into the CAV AF
     system.
     2.11.5. Coordination and Certification Requirements for MIPRs Directed to Non-DoD
     Agencies. If an Interagency MIPR is being processed, FAR Part 17.5, Special Contracting
     Methods – Interagency Acquisitions under the Economy Act, requires the MIPR to document
     the decision to place an Economy Act order in an Economy Act Determination and Findings
     (D&F) (ref. FAR 17.503, Special Contracting Methods – Determinations and Findings
     Requirements, for formatting issues). The purpose of the D&F is to document the reason it is
     in the best interest of the Air Force to purchase supplies/services through a non-DoD agency.
     The D&F shall be approved at a level no lower than the SES/General Officer in the
     requesting activity‘s chain of command. The D&F approving official must be determined and
     documented at each ALC. MIPRs are normally governed by the Economy Act; therefore, at
     the end of the year the customer funds expire, unless there is another authority cited on the
     MIPR.
2.12. Minimum Acceptable Qualifications of a Contractor.
     2.12.1. The minimum acceptable qualification that a contractor must possess in order to be
     eligible for award must be determined, whether the contract will be awarded through straight
     price competition or formal source selection procedures. This determination will be made by
     the PMS in coordination with contracting, ESS, Inventory Managers, SPMs, safety, and any
     other activities as required. This includes: adequate buildings, shop areas, manufacturing
     floor space, transportation facilities, runways, ramp parking area, engine test cells, secure
     storage (covered outside), volatile material, special tooling, fixtures, test equipment, training
     and experience of key management personnel, source and quantity of required labor, and any
     other areas essential to successful contractor performance. Specialized training, if any,
     required for contractor personnel will be identified under formal source selection procedures.
     A PAS may be accomplished to verify that the prospective contractor meets these minimum
     qualifications (ref. FAR Part 9, Contractor Qualifications). The minimum acceptance
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                        27


  qualifications may also be used by the contracting activity with the Demonstration of
  Responsibility Clause and by the PAS team in the event a PAS is required.
  2.12.2. When engine overhaul contractors need to perform repair of engine parts designated
  critical, the RFP will list those critical engine parts as part of the overhaul work. The RFP
  will notify potential sources that, upon award of contract, they will be required to qualify
  themselves to perform such repair, or they will be required to subcontract all necessary
  qualification information. Identify in the contract the requirement for the contractor to
  perform an engine qualification test run (Aircraft Part MIL-E-5009) before production to
  verify their technical competence is performed satisfactorily. In view of the additional time
  that may be required by the contractor to secure qualification, enough time should be allowed
  in the contractor selection cycle to perform this task, and to adjust all affected schedules. The
  Demonstration of Responsibility Clause will require evidence that the contractor can repair
  the critical engine parts identified by the contracting activity upon being awarded the engine
  overhaul contract and that the contractor is qualified to repair the critical engine parts per
  AFMCI 21-112, Repair of Aircraft Engine Critical Parts, to include being qualified at no
  cost to the government.
28                                                                AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


                                             Chapter 3

                           GOVERNMENT PROPERTY SUPPORT

3.1. Introduction.
     3.1.1. Policy. The ALC CRT must ensure GFM is only authorized for Air Force managed
     items, i.e., those exchangeable end items where the Air Force is the sole source and Air Force
     Managed Consumable (BC 8) items. Contractors must be directed to order through the MCA
     (CAV AF) for GFM regardless where the item is managed. Non-Air Force managed
     consumable items (Expandability Recoverability Reparability Category (ERRC) Codes N
     and P) will be reflected in contract documents as CFM and contractors will be encouraged to
     order from the applicable government SOS, i.e., Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), General
     Service Administration (GSA), Navy, etc as the first source for the procurement of CFM.
     There is no need for contractors to order CFM through the AF MCA. Specific information
     for the DLA SOS items and the use of the DLA e-Mall can be found on the DLA website:
     www.emall.dla.mil. Deviation from this policy requires a HQ AFMC/A4D approved waiver
     (ref. Attachment 12) submitted by the ALC/CSW or appropriate AFGLSC SCMW. Note:
     MSD consumable AF SOS managed items may be offered as GFM as part of the terms of the
     contract and do not require a waiver.
     3.1.2. Purpose. This chapter provides policy and procedures for property support for
     AFMC depot level maintenance contracts performed at contractor facilities. The provisions
     of this chapter apply to all AFMC CDM direct cite funded contracts. It identifies
     responsibilities within the applicable operating Sustainment Wings, Groups and Squadrons
     for ensuring contract supply support under the terms of the contract. Guidance is provided for
     preparing an Appendix B on AFMC maintenance contracts in the prescribed format (ref.
     Attachment 5).
     3.1.3. Scope. This chapter provides instruction for the proper identification, acquisition, use,
     and disposition of government and contractor furnished property, materials and equipment.

     to, or acquired by the government under the terms of the contract. It includes Government
     Furnished Property (GFP) (materials and equipment), and ST/STE, APP. This directive
     further expands AFMC, ALC, and contractor responsibilities as they pertain to AFMAN 23-
     110, USAF Supply Manual and AFI 23-119, Exchange, Sale, or Temporary Custody of Non-
     excess Personal Property, in support of contract depot maintenance.
3.2. Explanation of Terms.

            3.2.1.4.1.1. Industrial Plant Equipment (IPE) – DFARS 245.301, Government
            Property, Definitions. Plant equipment in federal stock group 34 with an
            acquisition cost of $15,000 or more used for cutting, abrading, grinding, shaping,
            forming, joining, heating, treating, or otherwise altering the physical properties of
            materials, components or end items entailed in manufacturing, maintenance,
            supply, processing, assembly, or research and development operations.
            3.2.1.4.1.2. Other Plant Equipment (OPE) – DFARS 245.301. Plant equipment
            (regardless of dollar value) used in or in conjunction with the manufacturing of
            components or end items relative to maintenance, supply, processing, assembly or

  3.2.2. For the purpose of AFMC Depot Maintenance Repair Contracts, the following
  expanded definitions are provided:
30                                                            AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


     3.2.2.1. Government Furnished Materiel (GFM). Direct materiel provided to the repair
     contractor that may be incorporated into or attached to a deliverable end item or may be
     consumed or expended in performing a contract. It includes assemblies, components, raw
     parts, processed materials, small tools, and supplies that may be used in normal use in
     performing a contract.
     3.2.2.2. Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). GFE includes ST, STE and APP,
     which, in turn, includes SE. Since different policies and requirements apply to each type,
     the ALC System Program Director (SPD) will categorize the equipment to be furnished
     or offered for loan into proper classifications. DoD or AFMC policies will be followed
     when GFE is provided to a contractor. A list of GFE to be furnished to the contractor will
     be made as a uniquely identified section or part of the Appendix B of the PR. An asset
     may only be loaned or leased to activities for the stated purposes, specified in AFMAN
     23-110. The Accountable Officer, Prime Item Manager and the Loan Officer of the
     activity responsible for the accountability of the asset shall approve each loan or lease. If
     the request is made under the category of ―in the best interest of the stock fund,‖ the
     approval level is at HQ AFMC/FMA after coordination at the local level (ref. AFMAN
     23-110).
        3.2.2.2.1. IMS, PM, ES, Engineers, Logistics Officers, PMS, and COs are required to
        ensure loan/lease GFE is managed and processed properly. Current policy and
        procedure for loan/lease on non-excess personal property to government and non-
        government agencies is provided in the HQ AFMC/A4S memorandum, dated 14 May
        07, subject; HQ AFMC Loan/Lease Interim Policy Procedures. The website for the
        loan/lease policy is: https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/LG/lgi-
        page/D035/loan_lease_control.html. Policy for loan/lease of AFMC managed,
        stock-listed, non excess property is undergoing major revision and will be centralized
        in AFMAN 23-110.
        3.2.2.2.2. Repair and maintenance of GFE (whether included or not included as a
        contractor overhead cost) is a factor in the fully loaded Latest Repair Cost
        (LRC)/URC/Unit Sales Price (USP). Replacement of GFE is a Sustainment Wing,
        Group, and/or Squadron‘s responsibility. If the GFE is a supply system item, then
        refer to AFMAN 23-110.
        3.2.2.2.3. Prepare a separate listing of GFE in Appendix B. When ST/STE or other
        GFE is to be provided according to the above policy, include a statement to this effect
        in the PR and provide a schedule of items, by NSN and quantity, as part of the
        package. Delivery dates of GFE and production schedules established for the
        contractor must be consistent. GFE must be available for delivery to the contractor as
        scheduled and must be serviceable by scheduled delivery date. The appendix B
        should also state that the contractor is to repair and maintain GFE and include those
        costs as part of their overhead. The contractor shall provide a replacement schedule of
        GFE to the applicable program office. The program office will use the schedule to
        budget for replacement of GFE. GFE disposition instructions (i.e., return schedule)
        will also be included in Appendix B to ensure the equipment is properly accounted
        for and returned to the government at the end of the contract. GFE will not be
        managed in CAV AF and must be tracked by the PR Initiator to ensure accurate
        equipment accountability IAW para 3.2.2.2.1.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                        31


      3.2.2.3. Facilities, when furnished by the government, will be provided under a facilities
      contract unless the cumulative total cost of facilities provided at any one contractor plant
      or location does not exceed $100,000. The contracting Buyer can provide assistance in
      determining the proper classification of property and in determining if a facilities contract
      is in existence or is required.
      3.2.2.4. Contractor Furnished Materiel (CFM). CFM in most cases is consumable
      material to include bench stock, provided by the contractor as part of the maintenance
      service. Consumable material is incorporated into or attached to an end item to be
      delivered under the contract or may be consumed in the performance of a contract. CFM
      cost is included in the cost of repair. All DLA and General Support Division (GSD) items
      are managed using the GSD Working Capital Fund (WCF) concept and will be CFM.
      GSD consumable managed items will no longer be offered to contractors as GFM
      without a HQ AFMC/A4D approval waiver.
      3.2.2.5. Appendix B. The property support portion of the contract provides procedures
      for obtaining GFP support, management control of assets, authorized material levels,
      material requisitioning instructions, and disposition of government property not
      consumed during contract accomplishment (ref. Attachment 6).
      3.2.2.6. Hazardous Material (HAZMAT). Any used or unused property, including scrap
      and waste, that is ignitable, corrosive, reactive or toxic because of its quantity,
      concentration, or physical, chemical or infectious characteristics. The property can be in a
      solid, liquid, semi liquid or contained gas form and may cause or significantly contribute
      to an increase in mortality or serious illness, or pose a substantial threat or potential
      hazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported,
      disposed of, or otherwise managed.
          3.2.2.6.1. Hazardous Waste. Any used or unused hazardous material that has no
          known use, therefore, must be discarded. This includes hazardous material not
          otherwise disposed of through plant clearance that the contractor has been authorized,
          by the plant clearance officer, to dispose of as hazardous waste.
3.3. Government Furnished Materiel.
   3.3.1. It is DoD policy that contractors should furnish all material required for the
   performance of government contracts. However, the government can furnish material to a
   contractor when it is determined to be in the best interest of the government due to economy,
   standardization, the expediting of production, or other appropriate circumstances. All BC 9
   (GSD) consumable items should be CFM and will not be authorized as GFM without an
   approved waiver from HQ AFMC/A4D. All BC 8 (MSD) consumables can be authorized as
   GFM and do not require a HQ AMFC/A4D waiver. GFM should not be utilized if the
   repair/overhaul contractor is an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and manufactures
   the potential GFM piece parts of the end items to be repaired/overhauled. Use of GFM in this
   situation will cause the CDM program to pay for unnecessary DLA surcharges on GFM piece
   parts that the end-item repair/overhaul contractor manufacturers and supplies to DLA. The
   decision to use GFM can only be made if the required material is available in the supply
   system. The Appendix B Attachment 3, GFM listing will only be utilized to documented Air
   Force managed assets in support of the repair requirements. All consumable GFM authorized
   by an approved HQ AFMC/A4D waiver will be documented with contract/delivery order
32                                                                AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


     data to identify which contract delivery order it is in support of, including all assets by NSN,
     quantity, nomenclature, SOS, ERRC, BC, unit price and extended value. Waivers are
     associated to annual ―bona fide need‖ repair requirements, are limited to fiscal year
     submissions for approval and are dependent on a justification that must include a transition
     plan to CFM (ref. Attachment 12). Other applicable reasons for use of GFM are as follows:
        3.3.1.1. Economy. If the government has material available in the supply system, that
        material, can be authorized as GFM instead of paying the contractor to purchase the
        material as CFM.
        3.3.1.2. Expediting of Production. GFM may be used to meet a surge requirement if it
        can be immediately obtained from the supply system. Any additional GFM must be
        captured in a modification to the original contract/task (delivery) order Appendix B.
        Since CAV AF is the MCA, the Table of Allowance (TOA) in CAV AF must reflect
        GFM quantities authorized or be adjusted (if necessary) for any additional GFM for the
        contract/task (delivery) order.
        3.3.1.3. Standardization. Use of GFM, may be authorized to maintain configuration
        control of items being repaired when requested by the ES or Engineer.
        3.3.1.4. Other Appropriate Circumstances. The following unique examples are not
        representative of normal day-to-day business. Other circumstances include, but not
        limited to, the government is the sole source for the material, the material is classified,
        etc. The PCO should provide this documentation in the contract file. It is imperative that
        the determination be made that no other sources are qualified to bid prior to allowing
        GFM.
        3.3.1.5. The decision to authorize GFM is to be made by the CRT and based on the
        material recommendation (Full Range Listing (FRL)/MRL/PRSL and ST/STE list)
        provided by the ES and the availability of material.
        3.3.1.6. The PR will include proper justification for authorizing GFM to a contractor.
        This justification will be retained in the new or follow-on PR package. If a case where
        GFM may be available but not necessarily required, the solicitation should request bids
        with or without GFM. Note: If the GFM item(s) is a modification kit, Life-of-Type item
        or an excess item, the justification will be coordinated with the ES.
        3.3.1.7. Materials authorized as GFM will be identified by NSN, Materiel Management
        Aggregation Code (MMAC), nomenclature, quantity, SOS, ERRC Codes, Unit Price, and
        extended value (with a total GFM listing value) in an attachment to the contract
        Appendix B and included in the PR package.
        3.3.1.8. If the contractor has GFM from a previous contract/delivery order, at the same
        facility and this material will also be required for a follow-on contract/delivery order, the
        GFM authorizations must still be captured in CAV AF on the new contract. If the
        authorization for this or any other material has not been added to the CAV AF GFM
        ToA, the contractor will not be able to requisition or receipt the material on the new
        contract. When material is required to be transferred from one contract/delivery order to
        another, the PCO will issue contractual modifications for the ―from‖ and ―to‖ contracts
        based on PR instructions and Appendix B authorization. This will contractually authorize
        and approve the transfer of GFM from one contract/delivery order to another. No
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                  33


     physical movement of approved material transitioning between contracts/delivery orders
     is required.
     3.3.1.9. CDMAG Exchangeable GFM Credit Turn-In procedures provides guidance for
     transitioning BC 8, MSD, ERRC Codes Designator XD_, ERRC Codes C and T material
     located in a contractor‘s bond room facility from a CDMAG contract to a direct customer
     funded contract managed in the CAV AF system. The ―paper movement‖ is necessary
     because CDMAG has already paid for the GFM to support CDMAG contracts (ref.
     Attachment 10).
        3.3.1.9.1. The G009 inventory balance must be verified, cleared from the G009
        contract balance, returned to the Air Force MSD for credit, and then issued to a
        managed contract in the CAV AF system. This must be accomplished with no
        physical movement of the material, but does appropriately place the inventory into
        Air Force owned MSD supply accounts.
     3.3.1.10. BC 8, MSD Consumables:
        3.3.1.10.1. ALC Production Management community will coordinate with the
        contractor to reconcile physical inventory and G009 inventory balances.
        3.3.1.10.2. ALC Production Management community will contact the Item Manager;
        if the item is in a buy condition, the credit turn-in steps should be followed.
        Consumable MSD GFM has been paid for by the CDMAG fund. When turning in
        unused consumables to supply, credit is authorized when the Credit Indicator (CI) is
        an A. The CI is controlled by the IMS and continuously changes based on asset
        position. When transitioning GFM to a direct customer funded contract managed in
        CAV AF, the steps necessary to maximize the credit to CDMAG must be followed
        (ref. Attachment 11).
        3.3.1.10.3. If not in a buy position, the ALC Production Management community
        will process an H transaction in G009 to remove the item from inventory, as well as
        an inventory adjustment (D8A) in CAV AF to pick up accountability against the new
        contract. Cost accounting will need supporting documentation (G009 product or
        email providing dollar amount) to support expensing this ―return to supply‖ action to
        ―non-creditable returns‖.
        3.3.1.10.4. If the BC 8, MSD consumable material will be issued to a DPEM higher
        level assembly, a MORD must be processed to reimburse MSD.
     3.3.1.11. BC 9, GSD Consumables:
        3.3.1.11.1. ALC Production Management community will coordinate with the
        contractor to reconcile physical inventory and G009 inventory balances.
        3.3.1.11.2. Since credit is not authorized for GSD items, the ALC Production
        Management community will process an H transaction in G009 to remove the item
        from inventory, as well as an inventory adjustment (D8A) in CAV AF to pick up
        accountability against the new contract. Cost accounting will need supporting
        documentation (G009 product or email providing dollar amount) to support expensing
        this ―return to supply‖ action to ―non-creditable returns‖. Note: a HQ AFMC/A4D
        waiver is required to authorize GSD (BC 9) items as GFM on a new contract.
34                                                           AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


          3.3.1.11.3. A MORD will be required by the DPEM or MSD customer to reimburse
          the GSD stock fund.
      3.3.1.12. The PMS has the responsibility of establishing an accurate contractual GFM
      authorization listing for contractor requisitioning. The CAV AF Contract Manager (CM)
      will take action to establish the CAV AF table of allowances by NSN and authorized
      quantities, IAW the Appendix B. In order to transfer material from a G009 to a CAV AF
      managed contract, the PMS must notify the contractor of the transfer and request a
      physical inventory reconciliation of G009 inventory balances. The PMS will also contact
      the DCMA ACO and the Property Administrator (PA) requesting assistance with the
      physical inventory of the GFM material identified for transfer. The PMS and ES will
      validate the request and GFM listing based on ―bona fide need‖ repair requirements.
      Once the inventory validation is received, the PMS will coordinate efforts between the
      CDM office and the contractor for proper processing and sequencing of transactions. The
      CDM office‘s primary objective is to provide a credit turn-in process to credit the WCF,
      while systemically providing auditable GFM tracking within all applicable data systems.
      The CDM office will also adjust G009 inventory quantities, if required. Based on the
      PMS and ES approved/authorized listing of material to be transferred, the gaining CAV
      AF contract‘s Appendix B must be contractually modified to include the transferred
      material. Disposition instructions will be provided for those assets which will not be
      transferred.
      3.3.1.13. The contractor will provide and finance all CFM not specifically authorized in
      the Appendix B. In emergency situations, material that is not readily accessible in the
      marketplace or because of lead-time considerations may be provided by the government
      as GFM on a case by case basis. The PMS will be required to ensure funds availability is
      documented via the MORD process. The PMS will also make any GFM adjustments in
      Appendix B and acquire a GFM waiver, if applicable.
      3.3.1.14. ST/STE is not identified on the Application Program Indenture (API) or MRL,
      but are determined necessary as GFP at the time of PR preparation. During the
      preparation of the new or follow-on PR package, the ES will develop the equipment
      requirement for attachment to the Appendix B. When government furnished ST/STE is
      lost or condemned, the contractor will notify the PCO who will notify the PMS and will
      report it to the LCO at the ALC which issued the ST/STE.
      3.3.1.15. Initial GFM Support. The initial stock levels of GFM support will be computed
      IAW the stock level computation procedures contained in Appendix B, Attachment 3
      with the exception that the pipeline time portion of the stock level will be excluded. The
      contractor will requisition initial GFM and reorder points will be adjusted accordingly.
      Appendix B should be tailored to reflect each contract requirement. To achieve and
      maintain a well-balanced stock position, the timely submission of stock replenishment
      requisitions is essential. Appendix B will instruct contractors of the need for initiating
      timely replenishment whenever reorder points are reached. Continued emphasis on timely
      stock replenishment based on established reorder points will minimize the necessity for
      priority requisitioning.
3.4. Instructions for Preparation of Appendix B.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                      35


  3.4.1. Purpose. The following information is applicable to GFM and the loan of ST/STE.
  The PMS must ensure the Appendix B is complete and tailored specifically to each contract.
  In order to maintain standardization, the PMS should follow the format found in Attachment
  6 to this instruction except where loan/lease of AFMC-managed, stock listed items are
  concerned; the preparing office will use policy/procedures found in AFMAN 23-110.
  Peculiar aspects of a contract may require specific modification of the basic format.
  3.4.2. Any deviation to policies contained herein, especially when the government is not
  used as the first SOS for items designated as GFM, will be fully justified and approved by the
  PMS before becoming part of the PR package.
  3.4.3. Assign a common identifier, such as the PR number, to easily identify the contract and
  any/all appendices (Appendix A, B, C, etc.) as part of the same contract.
  3.4.4. At the time of Appendix B preparation, the PMS will request an MRL/PRSL from the
  ES. If an MRL/PRSL is not available or is in less than adequate condition to provide the data
  required, the PMS, IMS and ES will jointly develop a list, by NSN and quantity, of
  authorized GFM to substitute for the MRL/PRSL. If the end items were previously repaired
  on a contract with contractor reporting (G009/CAV AF), the data system can be used for this
  effort. The following paragraphs provide a brief description of the FRL, GFM Allowances,
  PRSL and ST/STE.
     3.4.4.1. Full Range Listing (FRL). The FRL (AD200.F70FA7A7) is a consolidated
     listing of all components applicable to an end item. The listing includes all support items,
     material, tools, test equipment, bulk material, and technical data references required for
     the maintenance (overhaul or repair) of the end item. It is important to understand that
     this listing contains a complete printout of the data in the control record. The FRL
     provides an excellent basis for reviewing, correcting, updating, and file maintaining the
     API data. Output products available from the API system may become a part of the data
     package and be provided to the selected repair contractor. Accurate and effective
     reporting actions by the contractor are directly related to the accuracy of the API records.
     Note: The FRL will not be made available to the Repair Contractor.
     3.4.4.2. GFM Allowances. The total GFM Allowances are used by the contractor to
     establish initial stock levels, on items authorized by Appendix B (and documented as
     GFM allowances in CAV AF). The contractor is required to report consumption data
     which is used to adjust replacement factors. Accurate and effective reporting actions to
     the applicable government data system by the contractor, is directly related to the
     accuracy of these factors.
     3.4.4.3. Purchase Request Support List (PRSL). The PRSL is designed to aid in the
     determination of GFM in support of a specific contract. The PRSL is a three-part listing:
     Part I contains a listing of the end items and quantities of each item to be repaired during
     the life of the contract, Part II contains a listing in NSN sequence, of all components both
     NSN and Part Number (P/N) listed in the MRL which are required for completion of the
     contract and Part III contains the dollar values applicable to Part II.
  3.4.5. ST/STE. The ST/STE (AD200.FA0FA7B0) list itemizes the ST/STE required to
  repair an end item. The data is used for preparation of the work specifications and reviewed
36                                                                 AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


     for workload capability in a repair facility. It is also used to determine the need to furnish
     ST/STE and to identify which items will be furnished by the government.
     3.4.6. The ES will:
        3.4.6.1. Upon receipt of the initial list of contract items request MRL from the API.
        3.4.6.2. Create a new master record if the requested MRL reveals the end item has not
        been created in the API system.
        3.4.6.3. Review and update the API with appropriate input using prior repair activity
        reports, revised technical data, impact of possible modifications, cataloging actions,
        vendor engineering change proposals, and ES knowledge. The highest degree of
        accuracy, experience, and logic must be used in completing this update because of the
        impact on repair, both logistically and economically. The timing of this update must
        provide the most practical notice for the API system to interface with other related
        systems and provide output products timed to phased contract actions.
        3.4.6.4. During each of the above phases, as well as during performance under the
        contract, continuous changes may occur and impact end item supportability. It is
        imperative that data resulting from these changes be input to the API and action be taken
        to ensure continuing supportability of the end item. These actions may include but are not
        limited to:
            3.4.6.4.1. Identification and reactivation of stock list deletions.
            3.4.6.4.2. Revision of kit component lists.
            3.4.6.4.3. Corrections required by stock list consolidation, unit of issue changes, and
            source changes.
            3.4.6.4.4. Corrections required by maintenance decisions such as modifications,
            source code changes, repair limit adjustments, failure rate increases or decreases, and
            other maintenance actions.
3.5. GFM MORD (AF Form 406) Process.
     3.5.1. There are two distinct cases when MORD documents are required. The first is on
     DPEM funded contracts with GFM allowances regardless of the BC. The second is for MSD
     funded contracts with GSD (BC 9) GFM allowances. A waiver is required for all contracts
     with GSD (BC 9) GFM allowances.
        3.5.1.1. The PMS initiates a DPEM or MSD PR package along with the MORD, and
        forwards it through the appropriate Wing/Group Resource Advisor (RA). The RA
        reviews the MORD for accuracy and total value of GFM. The MORD value is associated
        with the GFM listing of material provided by the ES from the MRL listing in support of
        DPEM GFM or MSD GSD BC 9 GFM PR repair requirements. The MORD number will
        be documented in the Remarks Field of the PR and forwarded to the PK for continued
        processing.
        3.5.1.2. The first step in initiating the MORD is for the PMS to obtain a Task (Delivery
        Order Number (DO#)) and Accounting Classification Reference Number (ACRN). The
        DO# and ACRN identifying the appropriate DPEM/MSD customers‘ direct cite funding
        will be referenced in the PR Accounting Classification Information Field and the
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                   37


     Accounting Classification Field of the MORD. The total MORD value for GFM
     supporting the PR repair requirements is based on the MRL and historical consumption
     data from CAV AF and documented in the contract Appendix B. The PMS will retain all
     source documentation used to determine GFM cost and quantities. The DPEM office or
     MSD RA performs a final review of the MORD to ensure it contains a valid PCN, a valid
     requirement that coincides with a proper program authority and an accurate fund cite. The
     MORD is forwarded to the appropriate ALC office(s) for further review before submittal
     to the ALC FM Budget Office for certification.
     3.5.1.3. Provide the following information in the description area of the MORD:
        3.5.1.3.1. Use ―CAV AF MORD for DPEM‖ or ―CAV AF MORD for MSD BC 9‖
        to identify the contract funding source:
        3.5.1.3.2. Contract and DO# (17 digits).
        3.5.1.3.3. PR Number.
        3.5.1.3.4. Contractor Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC).
        3.5.1.3.5. Contractor Routing Identifier Code (RIC).
        3.5.1.3.6. Shop Code (assigned by ALC).
        3.5.1.3.7. PMS Code.
        3.5.1.3.8. Document the HQ AFMC/A4D waiver approval date, if required.
        3.5.1.3.9. When applicable, Project Funds Management Record (PFMR) and ORG
        Code for MSD sources.
        3.5.1.3.10. Identify MORD POC to include; respective ALC CAV AF Contract
        Manager‘s name, e-mail address, DSN telephone number, and DSN fax number. This
        is to ensure the MORD is returned to the correct individual after HQ AFMC/A4NS
        has completed processing.
     3.5.1.4. The ALC FM Budget Office will verify the funding source of the MORD at the
     Operating Budget Account Number (OBAN), Program Element Code (PEC), and EEIC
     level and forward the MORD to appropriate obligating activity (Financial Service Officer
     (FSO)/DFAS). ALC FM Budget Office will retain a copy of the MORD with their
     executed documents.
     3.5.1.5. The ALC FSO office will obligate the MORD in the General Accounting &
     Finance System (GAFS_BQ). Once the MORD is obligated in GAFS, the ALC FSO
     office will send the MORD to the CDM-Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) Team,
     HQ AFMC/A4NE, via email. The CDM-SBSS Team forwards the MORD with the
     pertinent information to load the SBSS PFMR.
     3.5.1.6. HQ AFMC/A4NE (CDM SBSS Team) assigns one three-digit SBSS/PFMR to
     each ALC for all MSD contracts. The Organization Cost Center Record (OCCR - ORG
     code) is assigned based upon the rules setup by each ALC. Different PFMRs are assigned
     for each DPEM funded contract and a different OCCR is assigned by rules set up by each
     ALC.
38                                                         AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


     3.5.1.7. The CDM SBSS Team loads MORD funding targets against the OCCR which
     rolls up to the PFMR in CDM-SBSS. The CDM-SBSS Team enters all pertinent data into
     the Enterprise Application Integrator (EAI) conversion table on the Electronic Systems
     Group environment which is maintained by the Combat Support Systems personnel at
     Maxwell-Gunter AFB, Alabama. The EAI establishes an electronic feed for translating
     transactions from CAV AF to the CDM-SBSS system. HQ AFMC/A4NS CDM-SBSS
     Team returns the MORD, via email, to the ALC POC identified in the MORD
     Description Field.
     3.5.1.8. The processing of GSD assets in the CDM SBSS requires GSD Stock Fund
     Authority to order/issue/requisition GSD items. The CDM-SBSS Team performs annual
     ALC data calls requesting out year GSD Stock Fund expenditures, by fiscal year, and
     forwards this information to the HQ AFMC/A4YF Stock Fund managers.
     3.5.1.9. The PMS will monitor the PR for contract award, final task (delivery) order
     number and ACRN assignment by PK. The PMS will be responsible to ensure the task
     (delivery) order number provided earlier in this process by PK for the MORD matches
     the one used on the final task (delivery) order. Should a discrepancy exist, the MORD
     must be amended in Automated Business Service System (ABSS) and the MORD
     amendment will follow the same processing procedures. The CDM-SBSS Team will in
     turn update the EAI by the task (delivery) order and ACRN for billings.
     3.5.1.10. CDM SBSS GFM transactions flow into the Standard Materiel Accounting
     System (SMAS) when the EAI receives a GFM Issue (ISU) transaction from CAV AF.
     The SMAS transaction will prompt DFAS to create a Standard Form 1080 Bill, Vouchers
     for Transfers between Appropriations and/or Funds, which is posted to the applicable
     MORD and the SF 1080, Vouchers for Transfers between Appropriations and/or Funds,
     bill amount, is subtracted from the current MORD balance. The SF 1080 Bills are created
     by the CDM SBSS during end-of-month processing
     3.5.1.11. During the performance of the task (delivery) order, the PMS monitors the
     MORD obligation and expenditure balances on the M03 (GV977-M03-M36_2391)
     Report. The M03 is a daily report published on CDM CoP under CAV AF SBSS reports
     and also maintained in the DFAS-OMAHA Online Report Viewer (OLRV) database. The
     OLRV is a web-based program providing DoD customers visibility over various reports
     and system products. The report produces an MS Excel spreadsheet listing the PFMR's
     target, expenditures and the difference (available balance) between the two. The PMS
     will maintain the historical GFM usage data and coordinate closely with the Wing/Group
     RA to ensure MORD funding is available at all times through the end of the task
     (delivery) order.
     3.5.1.12. The PMS:
        3.5.1.12.1. Will identify any funding shortfalls as soon as known to the customer for
        resolution. If the customer approves additional funding, the PMS will amend the
        MORD to account for the additional funding. To preclude negative MORD balances
        the ALCs should:
            3.5.1.12.1.1. Conduct awareness training for all personnel involved in the MORD
            process.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                       39


             3.5.1.12.1.2. Fund Initial MORDs to match CAV AF ToA authorizations for the
             vast majority of CDM contracts. Note: Incrementally funded MORDs require
             heightened awareness to avoid exceeding MORD funding costs.
             3.5.1.12.1.3. Use historical averages plus a buffer for initial MORD funding
             when quarterly funding constraints make it impossible to initially fund at the ToA
             levels.
             3.5.1.12.1.4. The ToA cannot exceed what has been authorized as allowable
             GFM in Appendix B unless approved by customer and documented in the contract
             folder.
             3.5.1.12.1.5. Monitor CDM/SBSS reports daily (specifically the M03 and D11)
             for all fund related transactions.
             3.5.1.12.1.6. Establish an expenditure trigger point (70-75%) for initiating a
             MORD amendment.
          3.5.1.12.2. AFMC/A4N, CDM-SBSS Team will assist in monitoring MORD funding
          balances by: Processing/monitoring the M03 daily, identifying PFMR over
          expenditures and notifying MORD POC via Email/phone of over expenditures.
          3.5.1.12.3. When processing MORD amendments, the PMS will use, in addition to
          previous information in the Description Field, the following statement: MORD
          Amendment. The PMS will process amendments (decrease/increase) IAW the
          guidance outlined in this instruction and file all amendments with the original
          MORD.
          3.5.1.12.4. If the customer disapproves additional funding, several options are
          available: Review remainder of work and funding associated to MORD, stop
          inductions of additional assets covered by MORD, reprioritize available funds,
          identify potential de-obligation candidates and work to avoid Request for Equitable
          Adjustment (REA)
      3.5.1.13. Once the task (delivery) order has been deemed production complete, the PMS
      will work closely with the PCO to financially close the task (delivery) order and de-
      obligate any remaining MORD funding.
3.6. Managing Appendix B Revisions.
   3.6.1. Any revisions to Appendix B must be forwarded to contracting by a PR amendment.
      3.6.1.1. Revisions will consist of only those pages being changed.
      3.6.1.2. A new title page will be prepared for each revision containing the same elements
      as the original title page. The new title page will contain the revision number and the date
      of the revision inserted under the date of the basic Appendix B. The second page of each
      revision will contain a list of affected pages. The listing will include each page in
      Appendix B with the applicable revision number to the left of the page number. An
      example would be:

Table 3.1. Example.
                 Rev. No         Page No.        Date

        3.6.1.3. The date, revision number and the file number will be included on each revised
        page.
        3.6.1.4. All superseded pages will be filed at the back of the document for record and
        reference until completion of the contract.
        3.6.1.5. When it is necessary to insert additional pages, they will be identified by adding
        the appropriate alpha suffix to the preceding page number, i.e., 3a, 3b, 3c, etc.
        3.6.1.6. The portion affected by the revision will be indicated by a black underscore for
        figures, words or phrases within a given paragraph, and by a vertical black line in the
        outer margin.
     3.6.2. For those contracts that have an approved waiver for consumables, the CM/PMS will
     maintain a listing of non-MSD managed items separate from the contract Appendix B.
     Changes to the list of non-MSD managed GFM will negate the need to modify Appendix B.
     The CM will annotate all changes on the listing when CAV AF ToA is updated. All
     authorized GFM items listed in Appendix B, to include the non-MSD waivered list, if
     applicable, will be loaded into CAV AF at NSN level and will specify the authorized
     quantity. The CRT will validate the availability of material before offering these items as
     GFM.
3.7. Requisitions and Priorities.
     3.7.1. Standard Air Force and DoD instructions for preparation and submission of
     requisitions for GFP support, as prescribed in DoD 4000.25-1-M, Military Standard
     Requisition and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP), will be used by all AFMC CDM contractors.
        3.7.1.1. The contractor will requisition only those items and quantities of GFP authorized
        within Appendix B of respective contracts. Contractors‘ requisition follow-ups,
        cancellation, modifiers, and backorder validations will be prepared according to
        instructions prescribed in AFMAN 23-110.
            3.7.1.1.1. The attachments to the Appendix B will provide code references the
            contractor can use to prepare requisition and turn-in documents.
        3.7.1.2. The policy and procedures for establishing Urgency of Need Designators (UND)
        and requisition priority designators are prescribed in AFMAN 23-110, and in DoDM
        4000.25-1. The contracting ALC will include, within Appendix B, the applicable Force
        Activity Designator (FAD) assigned per AFMAN 23-110. Attachment 6 to this
        instruction provides guidance for determining requisition priority designators to be used
        on contractor requisitions for GFM.
        3.7.1.3. Requisitions for urgent requirements to prevent work stoppages are submitted on
        a fill-or-kill basis. Fill-or-kill ―2C‖ advice code may be used for MSD material. All
        requisitions for items associated with production delays will be reported through the
        contractual reporting system.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                        41


      3.7.1.4. Requisition Status Codes are used by supply sources/inventory control points to
      relay information back to the requisitioning activity. Contractors will be instructed to
      refer to the requisition status codes contained in AFMAN 23-110 by providing them with
      the following URL: http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/ for the AF Publishing web site.
      3.7.1.5. The contractor shall not transfer material from contract to contract without the
      funding ALCs PCO issuing a contractual modification action. When the need for such
      action arises, the contractor will submit a written request for transfer action authority
      from the funding ALC. Transfer requests will contain the following information:
          3.7.1.5.1. Contract numbers to and from which material is to be transferred,
          including fund citations in the contracts.
          3.7.1.5.2. Stock numbers, quantity, and dollar value of material to be transferred.
          3.7.1.5.3. Verification that material to be transferred is excess to the needs of the
          losing contract and will not be reordered for that contract.
          3.7.1.5.4. All contracts transitioning contractor reporting from G009 to CAV AF,
          IAW HQ AFMC directive, are required to comply with AF MSD GFM credit turn-in
          process for transferring material. Note: CAV AF ToA, MORD and GFM waiver
          policies shall apply prior to lateral support transfer.
   3.7.2. FAR Part 45, states the contractor will be directly responsible and accountable for all
   government property according to the provisions of the contract, including property provided
   under such contract that may be in the possession or control of a subcontractor. Therefore, all
   requisitions for material will originate from the prime contractor. When the material is to be
   shipped to an activity other than the prime contractor, enter the service and activity address
   code (EZ number) supplementary address field according to DoDM 4000.25-1. Procedures
   for ensuring control of subcontractor inventories will be included in the prime contractor‘s
   approved property control system.
3.8. Physical Inventory Control.
   3.8.1. Physical inventory control of all GFP and end items in the possession of the contractor
   must be performed IAW DoD 4000.25.M, DoD 4140.1-R, Supply Chain Material
   Management Policy and AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 6. Physical inventory of
   all applicable GFP against CAV AF records must be conducted at least annually to verify
   accurate inventory balances.
      3.8.1.1. The inventory accuracy goal for all GFP with a unit price > $1000.00 is 99% and
      95% for all other material IAW D0D 4000.25-M.
      3.8.1.2. It is highly recommended the inventory sampling be conducted throughout the
      year to ensure proper processing of inventory records is occurring.
   3.8.2. The PMS will coordinate with DCMA to actively participate in a review of inventory
   records before processing inventory adjustments. Note: The contractor will not be given
   authority to process inventory adjustment (D8/D9) transactions in CAV AF.
3.9. Disposition of Excess Government Property.
   3.9.1. The following information is applicable to GFM and the loan of ST/STE. For
   information, regarding loan/lease of AFMC-managed, stock listed items; see AFMAN 23-
42                                                               AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


     110. These policies and procedures apply to all CDM contracts with property that is
     determined to be excess to the contractor‘s requirement to complete a specific contract.
        3.9.1.1. All excess property will pass through the Plant Clearance Automated
        Reutilization       Screening         System       (PCARSS)         Web          application
        (https://www.drms.dla.mil/rtd03/pcarss.htm. POCs are identified on the PCARSS
        home page). The requirements for this process are located in FAR 45.602-1, Government
        Property – Inventory Disposal Schedule. Contractors electronically notify a Plant
        Clearance Officer (PLCO) that excess property is available. The PLCO assigns a case
        number and notifies the owning organization via email that the items are available. The
        items are placed in a 90-day screening cycle. The owning agency has 30 days to claim the
        item. If the owning organization has a requirement, a requisition will be processed to
        acquire the item. If the owning organization has no requirement for the items then the
        PLCO will place the item in another 15-day screening cycle for other DoD activities to
        claim. During this period, DoD activities have priority. If after 15 days no DoD activity
        claims the item, then the item will be placed in another 15-day screening period where
        any federal agency (on a first-come first-served basis) can claim the item. If not claimed
        during the last 15 days screening period, the items can be donated to activities outside the
        government. If the items are not claimed by any agency, the owning activity will provide
        dispositions instructions to the contractor.
        3.9.1.2. Contractors will review the stock position of all items of GFM with ERRC Code
        designators ―XD1(I)‖ and ―XD2(T)‖ every 30 days, and every 60 days for items with
        ERRC Code designators ―XB3(N)‖ and XF3(P).‖ These reviews will be conducted until
        the contract in production is completed or terminated. The contractor will identify and
        process all items having inventories in excess of what is required to support the current
        contract. Concurrent with these reviews, contractors will review the requisition control
        record and cancel those requisitions on backorder when requirements no longer exist.
            3.9.1.2.1. Within 60 days of the contract being complete, all backordered requisitions
            (for items still required) having estimated or actual delivery dates, which will not
            provide timely support, will be canceled and a new requisition submitted on a fill-or-
            kill basis. The quantity on the fill-or-kill requisitions will be limited to only that
            required to complete the contract. Fill-or-kill actions should not apply to ERRC
            Codes T, C, S and U requisitions, if a valid requirement still exists.
        3.9.1.3. Loaned property listed in Appendix B will be disposed of as follows: 30 days
        prior to contract completion, the LCO will request disposition instructions from the IMS.
        The LCO will coordinate the disposition of these assets with the prime IMS and advise
        the contractor of required actions. Loaned APP is not to be considered excess to the
        contractor‘s requirement. These items are to be reported to the applicable ALC LCO
        when no longer needed or upon expiration of the loan period. See AFMAN 23-110 for
        further details regarding loan/lease of AFMC-managed, non-excess, stock listed items.
     3.9.2. Directed disposal of excess GFM.
        3.9.2.1. When GFM is in excess, the contractor will provide the PMS with a DCMA PA
        certified inventory of material at the contractor site. The PMS will, at a minimum conduct
        a desk audit to reconcile the contractors DCMA certified inventory against the applicable
        government reporting system (CAV AF). This requirement must be stated in the PWS.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                     43


     Discrepancies between contractor inventory and government system inventories must be
     reconciled and recorded in CAV AF (government system of record). If the discrepancies
     are major, an on-site survey by the PMS (or other qualified representatives) is highly
     recommended.
         3.9.2.1.1. If excess items are discovered during an on-site visit, on-the-spot
         disposition of excesses may be directed. Determinations of excess items must be a
         coordinated action between representatives of the on-site survey team, the ALC CM,
         the Contract Administration Activity representative, and the contractor, to ensure
         these items are excess to total contract requirements. A report of the excesses will be
         prepared, with a copy furnished to the Contract Administration Activity
         representative.
         3.9.2.1.2. Upon receipt of the excess report, each PMS will develop a list of assets to
         be returned to the ALC and provide it to the materiel support function of the ALC
         concerned. The organization making the visit will retain a copy for follow-up during
         the next visit to ensure that assets have been returned to the Air Force.
         3.9.2.1.3. Turn-in documents (DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document)
         will always be used and will be prepared according to DoDM 4000.25. Bar coding
         items prior to return will be accomplished according to DFARS Part 211.274, Item
         identification and valuation requirements.
  3.9.3. Government property support for follow-on contracts will be as follows:
     3.9.3.1. When the incumbent contractor is awarded a follow-on contract before
     completion of the current contract, all GFM in the contractor's possession will be
     screened by the contractor against actual individual line usage experience and production
     schedule. This is done to establish individual item requirements for support of current and
     follow-on contracts and will be considered as part of the initial lay-in for the follow-on
     contract. If transferred material is equal to or exceeds the initial stock objective, no
     requisition will be initiated until the time the stock level reaches the reorder point. The
     contractor will consider the old contract as first SOS before submitting any requisitions
     against the new contract. Materials that do not apply to any CLIN on the new contract
     will be disposed of according to Appendix B.
     3.9.3.2. When the award of a follow-on contract is made to a contractor other than the
     incumbent contractor, the contracting PCO and PMS must ensure that timely disposition
     instructions are provided to the current contractor for each item of excess serviceable
     GFM. The contracting ALC must be cognizant of all GFM excesses and must have the
     items cleared from the contractor inventory.
     3.9.3.3. When the GFM in excess of an incumbent contractor's current contract support
     requirements, a screening of items and quantities will be done by the contracting ALC
     before transfer. The screening can be done by using a Government system (i.e., G009,
     CAV AF) product or an on-site ALC team. The Seller PMS has the prerogative to
     designate the most qualified personnel to accomplish the on-site screening. When needed,
     DCMA representation will be invited to participate.
     3.9.3.4. GFM assigned to a contract currently in G009 transferring to a CAV AF contract
     shall be worked closely with the DCMA-PA contractor, the PMS and the CAV AF CM to
44                                                              AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


        ensure items are systematically returned in G009, avoiding a loss to MSD (ref. para.
        3.3.1.8.). Material transfers are specific to current bona fide needs identified for usage
        and are not to include part numbers, obsolete, insurance or investments items for storage
        purposes.
        3.9.3.5. No loaned APP will be diverted or transferred to another contract without prior
        request or approval from the applicable ALC LCOs. When such a transfer is made, the
        loaned assets must be authorized for loan under the gaining contract by listing on the
        contract Appendix B attachment, as appropriate and a copy of the transfer document is
        provided to the applicable LCO. See AFMAN 23-110 for further details regarding
        loan/lease of AFMC-managed, non-excess, stock listed items.
     3.9.4. Processing of Discrepancy Reports. The contractor prepares a Discrepancy Report to
     dispose of property received, which is not acceptable, not identifiable, or not required in
     support of a specific contract.
        3.9.4.1. Discrepancies related to shipment include misidentified items, variations in
        quantity, non-requisitioned items, lost or damaged parcel post, and items in dubious
        condition. These discrepancies shall be reported and resolved using the DoD web-based
        application     WebSDR         (Supply     Discrepancy      Report),     located     at:
        https://www.daas.dla.mil/websdr/home.asp. This system of reporting a Supply
        Discrepancy Report (SDR) has been developed in compliance with DoD regulations
        4140.1-R, Supply Chain Material Management Regulation and 4000.25-M, Defense
        Logistics Management System (DLMS) Supply Standards and Procedures, which requires
        automated SDR processing. In those situations where the SDR initiator is unable to gain
        access to the WebSDR, continued use of manual forms is permitted.
            3.9.4.1.1. Transportation discrepancies, such as shipment astray, shortages, pilferage,
            damage, vandalism, overages, or entire shipment not received, shall be coordinated
            with the DCMA Property Administrator and ACO immediately upon discovery for
            corrective action in addition to WebSDR submittal.
            3.9.4.1.2. For CLIN items received with missing components (Missing on Induction
            (MOI)), the contractor shall process a SDR immediately upon discovery IAW
            AFJMAN 23-215, Reporting of Supply Discrepancies, and provide a copy to the
            ACO within 2 days of discovery.
            3.9.4.1.3. Misdirected shipments of GFM, which are not part of the contract, shall be
            immediately reported to the DCMA PA by telephone, followed in writing within
            three workdays. The contractor is encouraged to contact one of the ALCs Customer
            Service Centers (CSC) with the Transportation Control Number (TCN) of the
            shipment. The CSC will advise for redirection of shipment.
            3.9.4.1.4. Overages, shortages, and misidentified items which are part of a contract
            and received by the contractor shall be reported into the CAV AF system with the
            received quantity and NSN. A SDR shall be processed IAW standard procedures
            identified above for these overages, shortages, and misidentified items.
        3.9.4.2. Damaged material received by the contractor from government installations,
        where such damage can be attributed to improper preservation or packaging by the
        shipping activity, will be reported to the ACO.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                        45


      3.9.4.3. Loss, damage or destruction of property where common or contract carrier
      liability is indicated when item is en route to the contractor, will be reported on SF 361,
      Transportation Discrepancy Report IAW DoD 4500.9-R, Defense Regulation
      Transportation, Part II, Cargo Movement.
      3.9.4.4. Material received with quality deficiencies will be reported on SF 368 according
      to DOD 4500.32R, MILSTAMP or TO 00-35D-54 USAF Deficiency Reporting,
      Investigation, and Resolution. Mailing instructions are contained in the reference section.
      Also mail one copy to the PMS and CM.
      3.9.4.5. When the IMS requests repair contractors to ship defective warranty items to the
      manufacturer for corrective action IAW AFMAN 23-110 the repair contractor should
      furnish a copy of the shipping document (DD Form 1348-1) attached to a cover letter
      addressed to the appropriate IMS.
3.10. Disposition of Condemned Property.
   3.10.1. The contract Appendix A policies require that the AFMC maintenance contractors
   evaluate the economy of repairing end items and components. Therefore, when an inspection
   reveals the estimated cost to repair (labor and parts) exceeds 75 percent of the replacement
   cost of the item, the prime ALC is notified. The item will not be condemned except when
   authorized by the prime ALC. Items authorized for condemnation will be disposed of at the
   contractor location through plant clearance procedures (without further ALC screening)
   except:
      3.10.1.1. All condemnations of critical items identified in Appendix A must be reported
      to the funding ALC for disposition instructions. Normally, the contractors will be
      instructed to submit such listings every 30 days.
   3.10.2. The following information is applicable to the loan of ST/STE. For detailed
   information, regarding loan/lease of AFMC-managed, stock listed items; see AFMAN 23-
   110. Loaned ST/STE, listed in Appendix B, is furnished in serviceable condition and, except
   for fair wear and tear resulting from normal use, should be maintained in such condition by
   the contractor. ALC contract administration personnel will investigate instances of loss,
   condemnation, or other circumstances causing the equipment to become unavailable or not
   usable for its intended purposes. This investigation will determine cause and liability, if any,
   and corrective action to be initiated. Condemnations of ST/STE because of ALC
   investigations will be submitted by the contractor to each applicable issuing ALC LCO. The
   list will be in ―Appendix B format‖ as an attachment to a cover letter prepared by the repair
   contractor and titled, “Request for Disposition of Government-Furnished Property,
   condemnations of contract, submitted per Chapter 3 of AFMCI 21-149.‖ If replacement is
   required and authorized, the contractor will prepare a MILSTRIP requisition and forward the
   requisition and a copy of DD Form 1348-1 to the funding ALC.
   3.10.3. Other exceptions, including precious metals or critical alloys, will be disposed of
   according to appropriate FAR, DoD, Air Force and AFMC policies.
3.11. Commercial Asset Visibility Air Force (CAV AF).
   3.11.1. Reporting in CAV AF is a contractual requirement and must specifically be
   stipulated in the PWS. If the ALC chooses not to have a contractor report end item
46                                                             AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


     production and GFM status in CAV AF, it will be the responsibility of the ALC CDM Office
     or PMS to ensure data is maintained in CAV AF, per DID (DI-MGMT-81634B).
     3.11.2. Instructions pertaining to CAV AF reporting are contained in the CAV AF System
     Administrator, Contract Manager, and Contractor user manuals. The manuals are maintained
     by HQ AFMC/A4DA and capture the requirements of the most current version of CAV AF.
     All       manuals        can       be   accessed       via      the       CDM       CoP
     https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-LG-CD-MM.
     Contractors can access the Contractor manual via the CAV AF access web page (ref.
     https://www.cavaf.com/cavweb/)
     3.11.3. The contractor submits GFM/end items transactions through CAV AF daily as
     transactions occur. The CAV AF system compiles real time summary status for GFM and
     end items. GFM reporting is an integral component of an industrialized contract maintenance
     program. Continuous surveillance is necessary to ensure timely reporting and accuracy of
     data.
3.12. Material Support Problems.
     3.12.1. The PMS is responsible for material support problems. The PMS will coordinate the
     contractor‘s reports of material support problems.
     3.12.2. The name, office symbol, and telephone number of the responsible PMS will be
     listed in contract Appendix B.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                       47


                                           Chapter 4

                          IN-HOUSE PREAWARD SURVEY (PAS)

4.1. Purpose. The purpose of the in-house PAS is to verify, before award of contract, the
availability and adequacy of the applicable MRL, and the availability of Modification Kits,
Support Equipment (SE), ST/STE technical data and overseas contractors. Past experience and
performance will dictate the required degree of the review. The following information is
applicable to GFM and the loan of ST/STE. For information regarding AFMC-managed, stock
listed items, see AFMAN 23-110.
4.2. Responsibilities. The PMS is responsible for ensuring all certifications on the in-house
PAS checklist are completed and the checklist is forwarded with the PR package. Such
certifications must be provided for all modifications over $1 million, aircraft PDM and engine
programs. Use of the in-house PAS must be varied to meet the peculiar circumstances of each
prospective maintenance contract. For all other programs, the need for such certifications will be
determined on a contract by contract basis. Information pertaining to the PAS can be found in the
FAR Part 9,106. Responsibilities for completion of in-house PAS certification are:
   4.2.1. Adequacy of MRL. In order to provide the contractor with a description and usage rate
   on those replacement components that may be used during the repair of an end item, the ES
   will certify the MRL to be complete, accurate and current.
   4.2.2. Availability of Modification Kits. The PMS, with the assistance of the IMS and the
   ES, is responsible for ensuring the TCTO Modification Kits are obtained, distributed and
   controlled in a timely manner to support all TCTO requirements called out in Appendix A.
   Modification Kits will be requisitioned by the contractor as specified in the applicable
   TCTO. Requisitioning process codes are contained in Appendix B. If the contract does not
   authorize MILSTRIP, the IMS/MM will ship under FD document number.
   4.2.3. Availability and Serviceability of SE. Identification of the SE, including designation
   of all peculiar SE, is the responsibility of the ES. The PMS will ensure availability and
   serviceability of the SE at the time of contract award. This may be done through storage in
   the Material Utilization Control Office (MUCO) account. The PMS will also provide
   instructions in Appendix B concerning delivery of the SE. If authorization for spares to
   maintain the SE is granted, it must be included in Appendix B. SE may be subject to loan
   procedures, as prescribed in AFMAN 23-110.
   4.2.4. Availability and Serviceability of ST/STE. ST/STE consists of dies, fixtures, molds,
   patterns, gauges, other equipment and manufacturing aids, electric or electronic, pneumatic,
   mechanical, and other items or assemblies of equipment. ST/STE is of such a specialized
   nature, that without substantial modification or alteration, their use is restricted to the
   development or production of particular supplies or parts. Most of these items are not
   federally stock listed. The SPM ST/STE manager controls these items individually. The SPM
   will complete the availability/serviceability certification. The listing of ST/STE prepared by
   the ES will be forwarded to the PMS as soon as it is definitized. The SPM will furnish the
   listing to the ST/STE manager who will check availability and serviceability and reserve the
   material for use on the contract. The PMS will identify the available and non-available items.
   A list of the available items will be attached to Appendix B of the contract. This listing will
48                                                               AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


     advise the contractor of the source and method of supply of the items. The loan officer is
     responsible for monitoring this program.
     4.2.5. Availability of Facilities Including Production Equipment. The PMS is responsible for
     completing this availability certificate. Facilities consist of equipment, machine tools,
     standard test equipment, furniture, vehicles and accessory and auxiliary items, but exclude
     ST/STE and APP. Facilities may be furnished to the contractor only under severely restricted
     conditions described in FAR Part 45. It is DoD preference to rely upon privately owned
     production equipment in defense contracts, especially general-purpose facilities. Before
     facility items can be furnished to the contractor, justification must be provided according to
     FAR Part 45.302. Upon receipt of the listing of facility items required and the justification
     required, the PMS will determine item availability and advise PK. The available items will be
     listed in the attachment to Appendix B of the contract. This listing will advise the contractor
     of the method of obtaining these items.
     4.2.6. Availability of APP. APP consists of items peculiar to agency operations and is under
     the cognizance of an agency inventory control point. These items are federally stock listed
     and do not include ST/STE or facilities items. APP with ERRC Code designators XD1(I),
     XD2(T), NF2(U), or ND2(S) are subject to loan control procedures. The website for the
     loan/lease     policy     is:      https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/LG/lgi-
     page/D035/loan_lease_control.html. Policy for loan/lease of AFMC managed, stock-listed,
     non excess property is undergoing major revision and will be centralized in AFMAN 23-110.
     The PMS will ensure a listing of all required APP is available with the contract. The PMS
     will request the LCO check availability and reserve items and quantities required for the
     contract. PK will be advised by the PMS of items not available from the government. An
     attachment to Appendix B will list all required items and state the method of supply.
     4.2.7. Availability of Technical Data. All data specified in Appendix A will be assembled by
     the PMS for review by the bidder. The data package available for review by contractors will
     consist only of data directly related to the work requirements detailed in Appendix A, section
     III. Additional data, such as general TOs required by the contractor, will be secured through
     the ACO. Responsible activities will provide data to PK for inclusion in the technical data
     package furnished for bidder inspection.
     4.2.8. Overseas Contractors. When overseas contractors are to be selected, it is the
     responsibility of the SPM/IMSs to provide procurement package to the PCO. Procedures for
     obtaining theater clearance are contained within the foreign theater clearance guide.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                       49

                          CONTRACT REPAIR PROCESS (CRP)

5.1. Introduction.
   5.1.1. Purpose. A contract repair process that will respond directly to customer demands
   while reducing inventory, process steps, queue time and total system operating costs. This
   requires a long-term business relationship with contractors to take advantage of innovative
   ideas and efficient management practices. As a result, customer requirements will be satisfied
   while using the least amount of resources available.
   5.1.2. Scope. This updated process is to be used by the CRT. The CRT will ensure all
   personnel involved with contract repair participate in the development and execution phases.
   5.1.3. Commodity Council Considerations. Commodity Councils are responsible for the
   assigned commodity groupings at the Federal Stock Class (FSC) level. The councils are: SE,
   Aircraft Structural, Aircraft Engines, Communications and Electronics, Landing Gear,
   Instruments, Aircraft Accessories, and Secondary Power. The councils‘ responsibilities
   include the development, implementation, and monitoring of enterprise strategies for their
   assigned FSCs. The approved commodity strategies are documented in Commodity
   Management and Commodity Acquisition Management plans. The CRT will engage the
   commodity council as early as possible in the CRP.
   5.1.4. PBSA. AFI 63-124 mandates the oversight and management of all services
   acquisitions for the Air Force and will be performed IAW the Air Force Management and
   Oversight of the Acquisition of Services Process (MOASP) (ref. AFARS 5137, Service
   Contracts, for information concerning the MOASP). The performance plan describes the
   objectives and goals of the CRT and their roles and responsibilities (to include the contractor
   performing the service), and how the CRT will assess contractor performance and manage
   the contract to obtain efficiencies, improved performance and cost savings throughout its life
   cycle. The performance plan (Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)) must be
   submitted with the contract solicitation package to ensure compliance with AFI 63-124.
5.2. Contract Repair Applications.
   5.2.1. Acquisition Reform Initiatives. All acquisition reform initiatives will be strictly
   adhered to by limiting the use of military specifications and standards, ensuring the use of
   performance oriented specifications, eliminating non-value added requirements and reducing
   contractor deliverable requirements. Acquisition reform initiatives are reflected in the
   movement to a PWS and contractor developed performance based statements of work rather
   than a government-provided PWS.
       5.2.1.1. Reform initiatives are accomplished by expanding the use of commercial and
       other best practices, further implementing the electronic interchange of information,
       maximizing the use of simplified acquisition procedure, and streamlining the
       requirements identification and proposal preparation process.
       5.2.1.2. Government oversight and control should be maintained through use of
       performance specifications.
50                                                              AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


        5.2.1.3. Technical data rights should be acquired only to the extent necessary for
        breakout, organic reparable requirements and spares procurement.
        5.2.1.4. Aggregate contracts and acquisition phases should be utilized when appropriate
        to promote stable contractor operations.
     5.2.2. As contract repair initiatives mature, contractors should participate on an informed
     level with organic and other contractor repair and supply elements. Dialogue with the
     industry should begin early in the requirement development process to create a mutual
     understanding of requirements and capabilities. Communication should continue throughout
     the life cycle of the weapon system.
     5.2.3. In a sole source situation, the contractor should be a charter member of the CRT (after
     wing or ALC/Judge Advocate approval). Contractors should be involved in the identification
     of the requirement, contract award, execution and closeout. As a member of the CRT,
     contractor input may be solicited regarding topics such as market research, risk assessment,
     commercial alternatives, contractor perspective on Appendix A or PWS, technical
     requirements and contract clauses.
        5.2.3.1. Avenues for exchanging information with the contractor include: Sources
        Sought Synopsis (SSS), Requests for Information (RFI), technical libraries, electronic
        bulletin boards, site visits, and Draft RFP/Pre-Solicitation Conferences. For smaller
        dollar repair actions, consider using a cover letter to the Request for Quote (RFQ)/RFP
        that explains contract repair and the unique initiatives included in the solicitation as a
        way to inform contractors.
        5.2.3.2. When used, an effective PWS does not reflect every aspect of the program; only
        those identified as principal objectives. The PWS also reflects the high and moderate risk
        areas of the contract. These two components allow potential bidders the ability to make
        necessary cost, schedule and technical decisions.
        5.2.3.3. Technical requirements should be performance-based and expressed in terms of
        the desired outcome. This allows the contractor to propose/apply appropriate techniques
        to achieve the desired results. Technical requirements should not define specific methods
        for achieving results unless mandated by law. Traditionally, military specifications and
        standards have detailed directions for designing, developing, testing, producing, repairing
        and managing weapon systems. In essence the military is prescribing a ―how to‖ for
        system development, production and sustainment. One of the initiatives of Acquisition
        Reform is to move away from heavy dependence upon military specifications and
        standards. The following should be considered in place of many of the military
        specifications and standards: Performance Specifications, Commercial/Non-Government
        Specifications, Interface Standards, Commercial Item Descriptions and Standard
        Practices. If deemed necessary, approval for specific military standards or specifications
        should be sought early in the CRP. Note: Many of the Military Specification and
        Standards have been canceled.
        5.2.3.4. The CRT should investigate the applicability of all specifications and standards
        prior to citing them in their repair contracts. One alternative is the use of the Data
        Accession List (DAL). The DAL is a list of the contractor‘s internal data generated in
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                      51


      performance of the contract. The documents are in contractor developed format and do
      not have a government unique format/content requirements levied upon them.
   5.2.4. Packaging Requirements. For new and follow-on repair contracts, most packaging
   requirements are already established. The packaging, transportation and regulated material
   data are maintained in D035T, Shipping Information System. The D035T packaging data is
   defined IAW MIL-STD-2073-1, Standard Practice for Military Packaging. Refer also to AFI
   24-202, Preservation and Packing, AFMAN 24-206(I), Packaging of Material, and AFJI 24-
   210, Packaging of Hazardous Material for additional instruction concerning packaging. This
   data includes methods of preservation, levels of protection, unit of issue, quantity per item
   pack and item characteristic.
      5.2.4.1. Under acquisition reform, the contractor is encouraged to propose commercial
      packaging alternatives. Even though packaging data is established, negotiations will be
      expected to occur when a contractor makes a new packaging proposal. The packaging
      specialist should be involved in these negotiations to ensure the proposed packaging
      meets the performance requirements. Commercial alternatives must be equal to or better
      than the requirements already established for Air Force items. The packaging specialist
      must participate in the development of the PWS, Section L and M of the RFP and
      analysis of bidder proposals.
   5.2.5. Transportation Requirements. The use of fast transportation is directed to have the
   item reach the requisitioner within the Air Force pipeline time standards for Agile Logistics
   Items (ref. AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo). It is critical that the
   ALC Traffic Management Office contacts DCMA and contractor transportation functions to
   ensure transportation responsibilities are clearly spelled out, agreed upon and understood
   before contract execution.
   5.2.6. Contract Repair Tenets. The CRP focuses on reducing the number of days from
   requirement identification to serviceable delivery. This is accomplished by; streamlining
   processes, reducing on-hand inventories, decreasing negotiated repair time and reducing
   contract repair costs. Contractors must deliver a serviceable item upon receipt of requisition
   within a specified time period as outlined in the contract. Utilize fast transportation (USAF
   policy) to accelerate movement of serviceable assets to the war fighter and time definite
   delivery whenever possible. Utilization of direct shipment of reparables and serviceables
   between the war fighter and the contractor allows for the contractor to ship serviceables to
   the field upon government direction and the field to direct ship reparables to the contractor.
   This eliminates the need for Amended Shipping Instructions (ASIs) or Initial Shipping
   Instructions (ISIs) and supports the war fighter by further accelerating the movement of
   serviceable assets.
5.3. Contract Repair and Implementation Initiatives.
   5.3.1. Financial Considerations. For years, contract repair requirements were based on
   system computed requirements and typically funded on a first come, first serve basis. Under
   the CRP, contracts are designed with a strategy to increase the speed and flexibility in which
   the funds are managed and executed. To achieve this flexibility, requirements are identified
   and funded in smaller increments based on EXPRESS prioritization. Specific ALC funding
   strategies are revised throughout the fiscal year based upon changes in requirement priority
   and cost authority.
52                                                               AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


     5.3.2. Contract Considerations. The expected outcome of an acquisition should be to provide
     the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. The Supply Chain Management
     (SCM), enables respective program workloads, including PK as CRT members, to work
     strategically towards developing a PR package. As a business advisor, the PK member of the
     CRT, in coordination with the rest of the team develops a plan for strategic sourcing, contract
     placement, and performance management. The goal is to get the ―right parts to the right place
     at the right time for the right price‖.
        5.3.2.1. On sole source contracts, the contractor can be solicited using a letter format in
        lieu of the traditional RFP. This methodology is utilized to meet the goals of acquiring
        services ―faster, better, cheaper and smoother‖ and should be evaluated by the CRT.
        5.3.2.2. Many types of contracts are available for use under the contract repair concept.
        One of the most beneficial is the Indefinite Delivery (ID) contract. The CRT must
        determine if any of the three types of ID contracts (Definite Quantity, Requirements and
        Indefinite Quantity) are the most effective. The goal of establishing long-term contracts
        should also be addressed by the CRT at this time.
        5.3.2.3. Pricing Arrangements. There are a number of pricing arrangements that can be
        considered. The type of arrangement should be based on the level of risk involved with
        the program. For example, a fixed price arrangement would be appropriate for a lower
        risk program whereas cost plus type arrangements may be more appropriate for higher
        risk efforts. Economic Price Adjustments (EPA) provisions should be considered in long-
        term contracts.
            5.3.2.3.1. There are many opportunities in which the contractor may be incentivized
            (award fee versus award term, etc.), which range from improved performance in
            terms of faster repair and return time to improved reliability (as measured by reduced
            process variability). It will be the CRT‘s responsibility to determine incentive
            possibilities and then assess the associated value.
            5.3.2.3.2. Tracking of award fee/term criteria and performance is made easier for the
            PCO/PM by utilizing the TRACKER website, for award fee/term (ref. para 5.4).
            TRACKER summarizes how often the contractor was able to meet or exceed the
            award fee criteria and performance and by how much.
        5.3.2.4. The CRT must review and assess a contractor‘s past performance in considering
        potential SOS in competitive situations. The CRT must also review past performance of
        sole source contracts. In cases of poor performance, the CRT should carefully review
        why the contract is sole source and look for ways to increase future competition. In
        addition, actions should be considered to improve the contractor‘s performance, i.e.,
        potential performance incentives.
            5.3.2.4.1. CRTs should strive to acquire commercial services and items when
            available (FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items). This leads to using
            standard commercial terms and conditions whenever possible. The teams should
            identify the available commercial practices; these can be modified or tailored as
            needed. In addition, normal distribution and logistics support capabilities should be
            used to the maximum extent. Commercial applications include, but are not limited to,
            commercial repair practices/processes, commercial packing and packaging,
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                      53


         commercial certification (self-certification of process/products) and commercial
         contracts.
         5.3.2.4.2. In cases where audit and analysis are expected, early involvement by
         Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) is essential. DCAA should participate early
         in the process when developing the contract strategy and can be involved in the
         requirement definition along with the contractor (if complexity dictates), which can
         eliminate unnecessary delays and misunderstandings.
         5.3.2.4.3. The ACO and staff provide valuable services that should be carefully
         considered during contract strategy development. The CRT should be familiar with
         the services the ACO and their staff perform and continue to look for areas of
         opportunity and improvement. For matters involving quality assurance, the CRT
         should involve members from the DCMA. DFAS should be invited in cases where
         new approaches and techniques may impact contract payment. New and innovative
         approaches to contract repair are encouraged, but the CRT must ensure all approaches
         do not adversely impact contractor payment. When appropriate, the use of a
         Government Purchase Card (GPC) is strongly encouraged under the contract repair
         initiative.
         5.3.2.4.4. As long-term contractual arrangements are pursued, the CRT must give
         consideration to what impact these arrangements will have on small business. The
         Small Business Office (SBO) should be involved from the beginning and be a key
         player in the development of the acquisition strategies. The acquisition strategies
         must address small business and small disadvantaged business participation both at
         the prime and subcontracting levels. Small business participation as prime contractors
         cannot be dismissed without an in-depth market analysis and a written determination
         which shows significant benefits to the government. Savings in cost of awarding or
         administration of contracts is not sufficient basis for not reserving an acquisition for
         small business participation. When an acquisition has been determined to be beyond
         the capability of small business performance as a prime contractor, the extent of small
         business, small disadvantaged business and women-owned business participation in
         contract performance as subcontractors will be addressed during source selection.
         Consideration will also be given to the use of the incentive, and award fee provisions
         to maximize both the magnitude and level of sophistication of work subcontracted to
         small disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses.
  5.3.3. Transportation Considerations. Fast transportation means first accomplishing the
  shipment planning process in the least amount of time and then using express transportation
  to deliver the shipment to the customer. It requires close coordination among the CRT and
  the three transportation offices: ALC Transportation and Packaging Management Branch, the
  DCMA Transportation Office and the contractor. The Transportation and Packaging
  Management Branch is a member of the CRT and shall devise the transportation strategy for
  each contract, and will recommend the transportation FAR clauses to be placed in the
  contract, and prepare a comprehensive explanation of the transportation strategy.
     5.3.3.1. DCMA becomes the Cognizant Transportation Officer (CTO) if the CO
     designates traffic management services to DCMA as identified in FAR 42.302, Contract
     Administration and Audit Services – Contract Administration Functions. When
54                                                               AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


        designated traffic management services authority, DCMA Transportation must determine
        whether a contractor is capable of performing certain transportation functions. DCMA
        then sponsors the contractor for access to Government transportation systems for use with
        Found on Base (FOB) Origin contract terms. Under FOB destination contract terms, the
        contractor is responsible for meeting shipping requirements.
        5.3.3.2. It is extremely important for the CTO to understand the transportation strategy
        and work closely with the contractor‘s transportation organization to support the
        program. The key to a successful transportation strategy is to implement fast
        transportation. In addition to fast transportation, transit visibility is required throughout
        the process. The customer should be able to track a requisition until it reaches the final
        destination.
        5.3.3.3. Time standards cover both shipment processing and carrier transit time. The time
        standards for carrier time vary from one day for domestic shipments to four days to some
        international destinations.
5.4. Implementation Tools.
     5.4.1. TRACKER. TRACKER is an Internet web site that provides users with information
     from a data warehouse of numerous data systems used by the Air Force. Information in the
     TRACKER database provides the flight line level user with information on their requisitions.
     TRACKER works by getting copies of the transactions that are transmitted between the
     computer systems used to acquire, store, repair and Air Force move assets. These
     transactions are in military standard formats as defined in MILSTRIP, Military Standard
     Transaction Reporting and Accounting Procedures (MILSTRAP), Military Standard Contract
     Administration Procedure (MILSCAP) and Military Standard Transportation and Movement
     Procedures (MILSTAMP). TRACKER aligns these transactions according to key data and
     allows queries to be made via those keys.
        5.4.1.1. Contract Repair Award Fee/Past Performance. TRACKER is used to gain insight
        and assist the ALCs with the management of contract repair performance. Information
        pulled from TRACKER provides the PCO/PM/PMS/MM with accurate and up-to-date
        performance information. This allows the ALCs to correctly apply the award fee.
     5.4.2. Requirements Projection on the Web (RPOW) for Repair. AFMC RPOW is a list of
     projected (for four fiscal years) competitive and non-competitive reparable items. RPOW
     forecast data is for planning purposes only and does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not
     a commitment by the government to purchase the described items.
     5.4.3. Contract Repair Metrics and Logistics Response Time (LRT) Analysis. A detailed
     analysis of LRT will allow the Command to gain insight into reasons for significantly higher
     than planned LRTs for contract repair items. CRTs should identify these items and analyze
     the pattern and trends, and possibly analyze contractor repair performance on these items.
     These items can be analyzed to examine any inconsistency and trends in LRT by using data
     from the past 12 months. This allows for identification of the consistent items which perform
     poorly, as well as those that have the potential for becoming serious problems. See
     AFMCFARS Subpart 5391.3, AFMC Maintenance, Overhaul, and Maintenance Contracting
     – Delivery Performance, for tracking delivery performance and AFMCFARS Subpart
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                         55


   5391.302, AFMC Maintenance, Overhaul, and Maintenance Contracting - Tracking On-
   Time Delivery.
       5.4.3.1. Each exchangeable repair contract will establish a data line item which requires
       a monthly report on the dates of reparable receipts by CLIN, Sub CLIN, or ELIN as
       appropriate; this requirement also applies for Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA). Include
       a CDRL (DD Form 1423) request in the PR package for a Depot Maintenance Production
       Report (DI-ALSS- 80728). The reports will be provided to the appropriate DCMA
       Production Specialist with copies to the PCO. DCMA will use these reports in calculating
       firm delivery dates for event-driven delivery schedules. DCMA will periodically validate
       the dates provided by the contractor.
       5.4.3.2. For repair contracts with event-driven schedules (i.e., after receipt of reparable),
       Automated Contract Preparation System (ACPS-15) will provide an estimated date to
       MOCAS. This date will be entered into MOCAS with an ―E‖ for estimated. DCMA
       requires technical specialists to calculate and enter a firm delivery date into MOCAS
       when the date of reparable receipt is known. The firm date will be indicated as an actual
       date (code ―A‖) in MOCAS. To the maximum extent possible any specific delivery dates
       should be negotiated (AFMCFARS Subpart 5391.303, AFMC Maintenance, Overhaul,
       and Maintenance Contracting - Delivery Schedule Guidelines). Do not cite a repair order
       delivery schedule by reference to the basic contract (i.e., IAW Basic). Exchangeable
       repair contracts with provisions for modifications require specific CLIN structures when
       there is multiple output NSNs permitted (See AFMCFARS Subpart 5391.304, AFMC
       Maintenance, Overhaul, and Maintenance Contracting - Special CLIN Instructions).
       When groups of P/N are input under a specific repair and a specific modification CLIN,
       and the output parts have different NSNs. Each output NSN must have a separate Sub
       CLIN. This will permit assigning a completion date to a specific reparable for delivery
       schedule tracking purposes.
   5.4.4. Web Sites. A wide variety of information on Logistics, Finance and Acquisition
   Reform topics can be obtained on the latest initiatives, sample clauses, changes, lessons
   learned, questions and answers, etc., by accessing the following web sites:

5.5. Contract Repair Team (CRT).
     5.5.1. Purpose. This section provides the information necessary to organize a CRT and aid
     the team in the development of a sound contract repair strategy. The CRT should be
     established after identification of a new requirement and should remain a team throughout
     the entire repair effort. While it is the IMS role to evaluate the tradeoffs associated with
     improved customer support, it is the CRT which provides inputs, advice and
     recommendations.
     5.5.2. Overview. CRT meetings should have clear objectives and should be allotted an
     appropriate amount of time. Initially the CRT should:
        5.5.2.1. Assemble the appropriate team members.
        5.5.2.2. Review the asset pipeline and information flow to consider improvements.
        5.5.2.3. Read through the CRT Considerations Document and RFP guide to develop the
        best approach for the PR package and RFP.
        5.5.2.4. Assign tasks to all members to complete their responsible parts of the package.
        5.5.2.5. Assemble the PR and RFP package.
        5.5.2.6. Resolve questions, which occurred in RFP assembly.
        5.5.2.7. Coordinate and assist in the approval of the PR/RFP package. A follow-up
        meeting should be scheduled once the contractor‘s proposals are received.
        5.5.2.8. Evaluate exceptions or other alternatives not considered with the RFP.
        5.5.2.9. Assign post-meeting actions and follow-up when items cannot be resolved.
        5.5.2.10. Further meetings should be scheduled after award has occurred to:
            5.5.2.10.1. Discuss lessons learned.
            5.5.2.10.2. Implement future CRT process improvements.
            5.5.2.10.3. Provide feedback to the team on the progress of the contractor.
     5.5.3. CRT Functions. The main goal of the CRT is to develop the most effective contract.
     To achieve this goal, functional integration within the team is encouraged. The CRT will
     collectively define and properly document all contractual requirements (for Unit Compliance
     Inspection (UCI)). The CRT will review the entire asset pipeline to develop alternative
     strategies for reducing the flow days and inventory levels at different points in the process.
     The resulting approaches will often require new thought processes and require CRT members
     to bring a new perspective to the repair strategy development. Initial contract cost should no
     longer be the sole measure of merit. With this new strategy, the CRT may simultaneously (as
     opposed to sequentially) develop the PR, synopsis and solicitation. This will significantly
     reduce administrative lead-time and eliminate misunderstanding regarding requirements. The
     CRT will remain active and responsible for overall contract development and execution
     through the life of the contract. This continuity is critical to work unforeseen problems and
     monitor contractor performance.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                       57


   5.5.4. CRT Composition and Roles. The membership of the CRT will vary with the contract
   repair requirement. As a minimum, the CRT will include the Logistics Management
   Specialist (LMS), or other designee (PM or Materiel Management Team Lead (MMTL)) as
   approved by the Supply Chain Manager, CM, IMS, PCO and the PMS.
       5.5.4.1. The Program Manager (PM) or Seller PMS when the assets support multiple
       programs will be the CRT Lead and will facilitate the individual CRT process steps to
       ensure the PR package is complete and accurate. The CRT Lead will formulate the
       outline of the requirement for the CRT and execute the duties of the primary action
       officer. The CRT Lead will formulate the outline of the requirement for the CRT and
       execute the duties of the primary action officer.
       5.5.4.2. The IMS is responsible for total pipeline management, which includes managing
       assets organically and contractually repaired; forecasting repair requirements; notifying
       and sending shipping instructions to the contractor(s); providing overall item, systems, or
       subsystems assessment support; supporting appropriate MAJCOM representatives with
       item related issues; managing current inventory status and location; monitoring gains and
       losses to the inventory and ensuring appropriate funding is available.
       5.5.4.3. The PMS will ensure the repair effort is accomplished, serve as the interface
       when more information is required from the customer and monitor the progress during
       execution of the contract through closeout.
       5.5.4.4. The PCO is responsible for developing and executing the solicitations and
       contracts. They will guarantee the special or unique provisions meet applicable
       procurement laws and regulations or will pursue waivers and/or deviations to implement
       when appropriate. Unless otherwise delegated, the PCO will serve as the primary/single
       face to the contractor on all contract related issues. The PCO is the only team member
       authorized to direct the contractor to perform work and obligate funds.
       5.5.4.5. After these core members review the general asset pipeline characteristics and
       worldwide position, they will jointly determine the requirement for supplementary team
       members. Potential team members may come from functional areas that include but are
       not limited to, the following:

Table 5.2. Potential Team Members.
Financial Management                      Transportation Logistics
Program Management                        Administrative Contracting Officer
Engineering                               Small Business Office
Equipment Specialist                      Acquisition Center of Excellence
Competition Advocate                      Contractor(s)
Judge Advocate                            Loan Control
Using Command Representative              Safety
Foreign Disclosure Policy Office          Packaging and Material Handling
ALC CDM Office
   5.5.5. Contractor involvement is vital to a successful CRT. In sole source situations, the
   contractor should be invited to participate in CRT discussions once the J&A is approved. In
   competitive situations, the CRT should determine the appropriate medium to obtain industry
58                                                                AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


     input. Some approaches may include draft solicitation, pre-proposal conferences, and
     industry days, etc.
     5.5.6. Each of the additional team members will participate on the CRT, as required, and
     apply their specific area of expertise to collectively achieve the goals of contract repair. The
     CRT should work with open mindedness, creativity and innovation.
5.6. Contract Technical/Repair Screening.
     5.6.1. Purpose. The purpose of the AFMC Form 762 is to establish an effective mechanism
     to determine and document Repair Method Codes (RMC)/Repair Method Suffix Codes
     (RMSC) and approved sources to support the acquisition of repair sources. An AFMC Form
     762 is required to be processed for items having an ERRC code of C, P, S, T, or U. Contract
     repair screening is required for those items that will be partially or completely contractor
     repaired. Reparable assets meeting the ERRC code requirement must have been processed
     through the Source of Repair Assignment Process (SORAP) prior to screening. Screening
     thresholds will be determined by the ALC and must be consistent with economic
     considerations and resources. Local ALC policies will be established and published to
     document screening thresholds as well as processing procedures for Surge, MICAP, and
     Emergency Purchase Requests (PRs). PRs for contract repair will not be processed unless
     accompanied by an AFMC Form 762. Copies of the AF Form 762 and supporting
     documentation will be maintained in a central data master repository until contract close out
     activities are completed.
     5.6.2. The following are specific exemption to the Contract Repair Screening process:
        5.6.2.1. FMS peculiar items.
        5.6.2.2. Insurance Items.
        5.6.2.3. Obsolete items.
        5.6.2.4. Phased out items.
        5.6.2.5. Items with annual repair values below the thresholds determined by local policy.
     5.6.3. Responsibilities.
        5.6.3.1. HQ AFMC/A4DA maintains functional responsibility for the Contract Repair
        Screening Process. HQ AFMC/A4DA will maintain the AFMC Form 762 (including the
        Repair Data List (RDL)), the instructions to complete the AFMC Form 762, and the
        policy in this directive as it pertains to the contract repair screening process. In addition,
        HQ AFMC/A4DA will coordinate training needs with the ALCs and maintain course
        materials.
        5.6.3.2. The Material Support Group at each ALC is responsible for developing
        processes and procedures for the following: AFMC Form 762 initiation/requests for
        screening, AFMC Form 762 status, AFMC Form 762 training, an AFMC Form 762 data
        archive, and Contract Repair Screening policy implementation. The sections/specialties
        involved in the Contract Repair Screening Analysis are the appropriate seller PMS, the
        cognizant engineer, equipment specialist, and screening technician. The following
        describes the responsibilities for each section/specialty involved in the contract repair
        screening process:
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                     59


       5.6.3.3. The PMS (with input from the IM/MM and ES) is responsible for initiating the
       contract repair screening and completing Part I of the AFMC Form 762. Specific
       instructions pertaining to the Seller PMS can be found in Attachment 9 of this
       instruction.
       5.6.3.4. Equipment Specialist (ES). The ES is responsible for completing Part II of the
       AFMC Form 762 and reviewing applicable data to determine if adequate repair
       procedures exist. Specific instructions pertaining to the ES can be found in Attachment 9
       of this instruction.
       5.6.3.5. Screening Office. The Screening Office is required to complete Part III of the
       AFMC Form 762 only if the proper coordination has taken place between the ES,
       Engineer, and Screening Technician. The appropriate coordination has taken place if the
       second box of the Data Field has been checked. Specific instructions pertaining to the
       Screening Office can be found in Attachment 9 of this directive.
       5.6.3.6. Cognizant Engineer. The Cognizant Engineer is responsible for completing Part
       IV of the AFMC Form 762 and for reviewing the information in Parts I through III (if
       applicable) prior to making a Repair Method Codes (RMC)/Repair Method Suffix Codes
       (RMSC) determination. Specific instructions pertaining to the Cognizant Engineer can be
       found in Attachment 9 to this directive. Note: D203/PRPS implementation will change
       the Contract Technical Repair Screening process. AFMCI 23-102, Purchase
       Request/Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (PR/MIPR) Operations, is
       currently being rewritten to include PRPS processes.

           REPAIR ACQUISITION PREPARATION AND EXECUTION GUIDE

A2.1. Purpose. This appendix guides the CRT in ensuring all areas of the Uniformed Contract
Format have been addressed concerning repair contracts. The first section concentrates on the
CRT and the subsequent sections address specific contract formats and completion of the PR.
Contract format information can be found in the FAR, Part 14.2, Sealed Bidding - Solicitation of
Bids.
A2.2. Contract Repair Teams.
     A2.2.1. Does the CRT include at a minimum: MMTLs, PMSs, PCOs, IMS and the
     supplementary functional members as deemed necessary? Note: Supplementary members
     may include the Program Director Representative, FM Representative, Competition
     Advocate, Equipment Specialist, Engineer, Using Command Representative, Acquisition
     Center of Excellence (ACE) Representative, Packaging and Materials Handling Office,
     Transportation Logistics Management and/or Contractor (for sole source buys), Technology
     and Industrial Support Directorate (TI), Safety office, LMS/PM, Quality Assurance, Staff
     Judge Advocate (JA), Foreign disclosure policy office and any supporting IMS.
     A2.2.2. Has the IMS reviewed all aspects of the pipeline in order to achieve an acceptable
     level of issue effectiveness at the base? Note: The IMS should perform a pipeline analysis to
     determine the specific aspects of the repair pipeline needing improvement. The IMS should
     identify the findings to the CRT.
     A2.2.3. What problems/issues have arisen under the current contract that needs to be
     corrected? Note: Have there been problems with GFM/parts/reparables? Have delays been
     experienced in DCMA acceptance? Have there been deficiency reports?
     A2.2.4. Did the team review/identify candidate areas that need improvement? Note: The
     CRT should consider if the weapon system Total Not Mission Capable for Supply (TNMCS)
     is too high? Is it in the Critical Item Program? Are Mission Capable (MICAP) hours
     significant? Is the item in a buy position? Will the item remain in the inventory?
     A2.2.5. Has market research been conducted to determine if commercial items are available
     to satisfy any of the requirements?
     A2.2.6. What type of contract best fits the requirement?
     A2.2.7. Will a draft RFP be used to solicit suggestions/ideas from potential bidders
     (competitive actions)?
     A2.2.8. Will the contract be sole source? If so, develop and attach the J&A prepared IAW
     the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA).
     A2.2.9. Does the CRT deem a multiple source strategy more appropriate?
     A2.2.10. If other prospective contractors can possibly support the requirement, is a pre-
     award survey planned to gather additional information for the CRT?
     A2.2.11. Can the CRT develop electronic connectivity with contractors and potential bidders
     for solicitation, contract award and deliverables? Note: Electronic connectivity that could
     include issuance of solicitations and/or contracts should be sought and encouraged.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                      75


   Electronic communications provides tremendous opportunity for passing data and
   streamlining business arrangements.
   A2.2.12. Can other requirements be consolidated for greater leverage and flexibility in the
   solicitation, i.e. Corporate Contract or Strategic Sourcing? Note: A Corporate Contract is a
   long-term contract with pre-established pricing that consolidates requirements with a single
   contractor.
   A2.2.13. Are all NSNs with possible requirements for this system covered on this PR?
   A2.2.14. Have new and innovative approaches been coordinated with key players such as
   DCMA/DFAS/DCAA?
   A2.2.15. Can the CRT develop a multi-year contract for the requirement? Note: Multi-year
   contracts (5-10 years) are encouraged with quality performing contractors. The CRT should
   actively pursue contract arrangements for a minimum of 5 years with a goal toward 10.
A2.3. Uniform Contract Format.
   A2.3.1. PART 1 – Schedule.
      A2.3.1.1. Section A – Solicitation, Offer and Award.
          A2.3.1.1.1. Has the invitation for bids been prepared on a Standard Form 33,
          Solicitation, Offer and Award? Note: The SF 33 is the first page of the solicitation
          and includes Section A of the uniform contract format. When the SF 1447,
          Solicitation/Contract, is used as the solicitation document, ensure the name, address,
          and location of issuing activity as well as the time specified for receipt of bids in
          reflected in Agency Use Field of the SF 1447. If the SF 33 and SF 1447 are not used,
          the following information is mandatory for the first page of the solicitation: Name,
          address, and location of issuing activity (include building and room number where
          bids are to be submitted); Invitation for Bids number; date of issuance; time specified
          for receipt of bids; number of pages; requisition or other purchase authority;
          requirement for bidder to provide its name and complete address, including street,
          city, county, state, and ZIP code; and a statement that bidders should include the
          address to which payment should be mailed, if the address is different from that of the
          bidder.
      A2.3.1.2. Section B – Supplies or Services and Prices/Cost.
          A2.3.1.2.1. Is GFM or GFE required by the contractor and in the best interest of the
          Government? Note: Air Force and DoD policy states contractors will furnish all
          material required for the performance of government contracts; however, the
          government can furnish material to a contractor when it is determined to be in the
          best interest of the government.
          A2.3.1.2.2. Does training need to be provided on the mandatory use of the CAV AF
          System? Notify the appropriate ALC CM as early as possible to determine and
          schedule appropriate CAV AF training requirements.
          A2.3.1.2.3. Does the CRT agree that the funding strategy provides the greatest
          flexibility for the repaired item?
      A2.3.1.3. Section C –Description/Specification/Performance Work Statement (PWS).
76                                                        AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


     A2.3.1.3.1. Does the contract use a PWS? Note: The CRT should use a PWS in
     competitive repair efforts. The PWS can be beneficial in sole source environments
     when a complete or fresh review of the requirement is needed. This ensures the
     Government is not unnecessarily constraining the contractor‘s repair efforts and use
     of commercial applications. The PWS should include work requirements, including
     quality, security, acceptance, and testing requirements.
     A2.3.1.3.2. Does the PWS maximize commercial practices? Note: The CRT must
     consider all possible commercial practices when and if applicable. Commercial
     applications include but are not limited to: commercial repair practices/processes,
     commercial packing and packaging, commercial certification (self-certification of
     processes/product) and commercial contracts (FAR Part 12).
     A2.3.1.3.3. Did the CRT eliminate; to the maximum extent possible, the use of
     Military Specifications/Standards? Note: The CRT must review all applicable
     Military specifications/standards and carefully consider elimination and replacement
     of requirements with commercial specifications/standards. The application of peculiar
     Military specifications/standards adds process time and dollars to the repair effort. In
     most cases an acceptable commercial practice is adequate.
     A2.3.1.3.4. Are all referenced commercial standards, documents and TOs current and
     complete?
     A2.3.1.3.5. Are standard commercial safety practices requested? Note: Remember to
     include special requirements and inspection, i.e., Safety of Flight TCTO.
     A2.3.1.3.6. Where specifications are necessary, does the contract use performance
     oriented specifications? Note: Performance oriented specifications provide an avenue
     for design improvements without changing the contract. A performance-based
     specification lists the form, fit, function and interface (F3I) of the items and lets the
     contractor work within those constraints to design the item. When performance must
     be specified, the CRT should consider use of performance oriented specifications
     under the following conditions: when the item involves fast changing technology
     such as electronics or computers, when the item is procured in higher quantities, and
     when there are numerous possible design approaches for the item. Engineering should
     be involved early in the process and should be consulting with the CRT often
     regarding F3I, configuration management, etc.
     A2.3.1.3.7. Does the contract include contractor incentives to reduce flow days?
     Note: The contract should emphasize the desire to reduce pipeline flow days. Try to
     identify what aspects of the repair requirement need laid-in piece parts. Reduction of
     pipeline days directly impact the number of assets needed in the supply pipeline. The
     CRT should flow out (number of days) movement of assets from the user (base) to
     the repair facility and back looking for opportunities to reduce/eliminate excessive
     days. The Production Management community will identify the source of flow days
     negotiated with the contractor (historical records from previous contracts, industry
     standards, etc.) and document agreed upon flow days in the repair contract. Contract
     repair flow days will also be recorded in CAV AF. PMSs are required to review
     contractor flow day repair requirements quarterly to ensure repair contractors are on
     target. This review will be documented in the contract repair folder.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                    77


     A2.3.1.4. Section D – Packaging and Marking.
        A2.3.1.4.1. Are commercial packaging options considered or applicable for the
        contracting action? Note: Provide packaging, packing, preservation, and marking
        requirements as applicable.
     A2.3.1.5. Section E – Inspection and Acceptance.
        A2.3.1.5.1. Are standard commercial quality and inspection practices requested?
        Note: Quality system requirements are stated in terms of performance attributes and
        translated in Section L – Instruction to Bidders, and Section M – Evaluation Criteria.
        Specifications and Standards Reform along with the Single Process Initiative (SPI),
        allows ALCs to propose any quality system which meets the RFP performance
        specifications and can be audited by the applicable DCMA activity. ALCs have the
        flexibility to use a basic quality system or advanced quality practices to remain
        competitive with commercial suppliers. An example of a basic quality system is one
        of the models within the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9000 series.
        A2.3.1.5.2. Are there provisions in the RFP to allow bidders to respond with
        alternative business, management and/or manufacturing processes or allow bidders to
        propose previously approved DoD SPI? Note: SPI in manufacturing includes
        soldering, welding, non-destructive inspection, torque specs, and material standards.
        SPI examples in business and management include cost control systems.
        A2.3.1.5.3. Are first production tests or special ATPs being requested? Note: If so,
        allow enough notification time before testing to allow government inputs into the test
        planning. Ensure ATPs or test reports are using the correct funding. Clarify any
        requested flight test requirements to include flight crew composition.
        A2.3.1.5.4. Is it possible and/or practical to implement contractor final inspection of
        the item on behalf of the Air Force (contractor certification)?
     A2.3.1.6. Section F – Deliveries or Performance.
        A2.3.1.6.1. Does the CDRL reduce unnecessary data requirements? Note: The CRT
        must review and scrutinize all contract data requirements and ensure all data required
        is absolutely necessary. Outside of the required CAV AF asset/material reporting any
        other information/data requirements should be appropriately justified.
        A2.3.1.6.2. Does the RFP include the CDRLs required to evaluate the contractor‘s
        product quality, cost and schedule performance? Note: Contract clauses need to
        consider possible savings through evaluation of the contractor‘s in-process
        performance at the contractor‘s facility. Informal reviews are preferred over formal
        reviews.
        A2.3.1.6.3. Have the proper delivery format for CDRL items been selected, such as
        TCTOs?
        A2.3.1.6.4. Are the DIDs current and appropriate? Note: Consider extensive use of
        contractor format on CDRLs. Modify the DIDs to save cost where possible, IAW
        MIL-STD-963B.
78                                                       AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


     A2.3.1.6.5. Have CDRL options been considered for the out-years when funding or
     requirements are uncertain?
     A2.3.1.6.6. Does the contract allow for ―shipment on demand‖? Note: Once assets
     are repaired and in serviceable condition, the contract should authorize the contractor
     to ship them based on a prioritized customer demand, i.e., valid requisition.
     A2.3.1.6.7. Does the contract allow for prioritized repair? Note: The contract should
     allow for redirection by the Government as repair priorities change with time. This is
     an important consideration of the CRT. Prioritization will ensure that in the event of
     competing resources a methodology exists to ensure the most important requirement
     is repaired first.
     A2.3.1.6.8. In reference to speed and economy, is the most effective commercially
     available transportation method used? Note: The contract should support the most
     effective method to return the item to government inventory when needed. The
     contract should not direct a specific mode, but request the most expedient method
     within a time goal. Fast transportation means fastest means possible, which does not
     necessarily mean overnight air. Fast Transportation applies to all movement points in
     the pipeline.
     A2.3.1.6.9. Does the contract authorize direct shipments? Note: It is vital to
     eliminate any unnecessary movement of reparable or serviceable assets. The CRT
     must assess the value anytime the assets go through an intermediate location.
     A2.3.1.6.10. Does the contract contain aspects that would result in reduced
     inventories? Note: Items to consider include: allowing for Consolidated Serviceable
     Inventory (CSI)/Consolidated Reparable Inventory (CRI) at the contractor‘s facility
     (if computed by Reliability Based Logistics), allowing delivery from the contractor
     directly to the user, incentives for fast repair response by the contractor and/or
     incentives to support responsiveness to change in quantity demands.
     A2.3.1.6.11. Does the contract provide incentives for reduced repair time? Note: An
     element of the overall pipeline time is that required to actually repair the item. The
     CRT (led by the contractor in this review) should look for all wait/stop points in the
     repair process and determine what changes can improve this time.
     A2.3.1.6.12. Does the contract consider past performance in selecting contractor
     incentives? Note: The CRT must review and assess a contractor‘s past performance
     in considering potential SOS (in competitive situations). The CRT should also review
     past performance of sole source actions. In cases of poor performance, the CRT
     should carefully review why the action is sole source and look for ways to ensure
     future competitions.
     A2.3.1.6.13. Does the contract provide contractor performance incentives in other
     areas? Note: There are many opportunities in which the contractor can receive
     incentives. These range from improved performance in terms of faster repair and
     return time to improved reliability. It will be the CRTs responsibility to look for
     incentive possibilities and then assess the value associated with them. While
     incentives have not been used extensively in repair contracts they should still be
     considered by the CRT and proposed when appropriate.

         A2.3.1.6.14. Does the product delivery schedule conflict with other delivery
         schedules, such as ATP or other data requirements? Note: The delivery schedule
         needs to adequately state the delivery requirements.
         A2.3.1.6.15. Is a MRL and other logistics support documents applicable? Note:
         Maintenance     acceleration/compression  requirements  and    Aircraft/Missile
         Maintenance Production Compression Report (AMRP) must be clearly defined.
         A2.3.1.6.16. Is an item subject to bailment and/or separate maintenance agreements?
         A2.3.1.6.17. Has the CRT considered where the final support location of the item
         will be and specific support requirements for that location? Note: If the system will
         transfer to organic repair during the life of the requirements contract, be sure to
         include the contract clauses and deliverables required for transition of the workload
         from contract to organic.
     A2.3.1.7. Section G – Contract Administration Data.
         A2.3.1.7.1. If other funds besides customer direct cite are on the PR, are the line

         of aircraft, fuel, etc.?
     A2.3.1.8. Section H – Special Contract Requirements.
         A2.3.1.8.1. Is the contract with an overseas contractor? Note: If the contract is with
         an overseas contractor, add the following remarks: ―Employment of Third Country
         Nationals: Contractor must obtain prior authority from the Procuring Contracting
         Office to employ third country nationals in the performance of this contract. Third

         nation. Contractor may discuss potential employment with prospective third country
         nationals on this contract to determine qualifications. However, no firm offer shall be
         made without written approval from the PCO. Subcontracting to Third Country
         Firms: Contractor must obtain prior authority from the PCO before subcontracting
         with firms owned or controlled by third countries in connection with this contract
         (third countries are considered to be those other than the United States or the home
         country of this contractor).‖ No US Government information will be disclosed to
         third country firms without the written approval of the PCO.

            contract clause provisions and applications. Contract incentives combined with the
            value engineering clauses can result in contractor improvements and cost savings
            without compromising technical requirements or changing interfaces.

            that this clause be used on MOD/PDM, and aircraft engine overhaul contracts where
            timely delivery is of the utmost importance. If this is an aircraft PDM overhaul
            contract, then state ―Liquidated damages and payment for accelerated delivery
            clauses will be included in the contract.‖
            A2.3.3.3.4. Does the package require a Maintenance Data Collection Record? Note:

A2.4. Purchase Request (PR) Considerations.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                    81


  A2.4.1. Purchase Request (PR). The following section provides the information required for
  the completion of the AFMC Form 36.
     A2.4.1.1. The AFMC Form 36 and the Continuation Sheet; will be prepared by the PMS.
     The reverse side of the form will be used as a continuation of fields on the front. If
     additional space is required, use the continuation sheet or plain bond paper marked
     "continuation sheet" top center of the page. The PR number will be listed in upper left
     corner of the page.
         A2.4.1.1.1. Page Numbers. Insert in the upper right hand corner, including any
         continuation pages and total number of pages (example: Page 1 of 5 pages). This
         includes only the PR and plain continuation sheets; it does not include attachments or
         exhibits.
         A2.4.1.1.2. Determine whether or not organic capability is available. If not, ensure
         documentation is placed in NSN folder. Note: CRT should discuss the proper amount
         of documentation needed for justification.
         A2.4.1.1.3. Make certain all NSNs with possible requirements for this acquisition
         include all alternate part numbers, nomenclature and stock list price.
         A2.4.1.1.4. The CRT should discuss the applicability of a requirements contract and
         consider the basic/option year(s) period.
         A2.4.1.1.5. The CRT should discuss the range of quantities/levels assigned to the
         CRI and the CSI based upon Readiness Based Leveling (RBL) and the Best
         Estimated Quantity (BEQ). If applicable, the CRT should ensure these quantities are
         flexible enough to cover both an increase and decrease in requirements [min
         (minimum quantity should be zero)/max].
            A2.4.1.1.5.1. Quantities need to reflect the BEQ for the basic period as well as
            the BEQ for each option year. If it is an IDIQ, there is a need to identify the
            minimum contract amount and the maximum contractual quantity.
            A2.4.1.1.5.2. PR needs to specify the exact minimum order amount and the
            maximum order amount (not to be confused with the min/max discussed above).
         A2.4.1.1.6. If first production testing or ATPs are required, allow enough time before
         testing to allow for government planning. Ensure the correct funding is used when
         using ATPs or test reports.
         A2.4.1.1.7. Minimum essential requirements are needed to evaluate the contractor.
         Note: Contracting agencies may not use specifications or conditions that are unduly
         restrictive. Plans, drawings, specification, standards or purchase descriptions must
         state only the government's actual "minimum needs."
         A2.4.1.1.8. The delivery schedule should adequately state the delivery requirements.
         Note: Under a performance-based environment, this will be addressed as a unit of
         time.
         A2.4.1.1.9. All fund cites should be correctly annotated on the PR.
         A2.4.1.1.10. The liquidated damages clause may or may not be required (consult a
         PCO). If actual damages can be determined then the liquidated damage clause is not
82                                                         AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009

DFAS office.‖
Identify the Synopsis Code.                       Identify if DD Form 254 is required.

           A2.4.1.2.27. Line Item No. Field (13A). Enter corresponding line number from the
           Item No Field (8A).
           A2.4.1.2.28. Accounting Classification Field (13B): Note: Obtain the complete
           accounting classification(s) from the program analyst (funds management).
           A2.4.1.2.29. Approvals Field (14). The signature(s) will be obtained by initiator,
           prior to final submission to L_K, depending on the dollar values. For Planning PRs,
           the signature level is based on the total contract amount.
       A2.4.1.3. Delivery Orders. New PRs for Delivery Orders will also be prepared on
       AFMC Form 36. New PR numbers will be used on individual Delivery Orders. When
       preparing a new PR for a Delivery Order the following are applicable: line items begin
       with 0001 in Item No Field (8A), all line items funded on the delivery order will cite the
       CLIN in Description Field (8B), delivery and shipping instructions will be according to
       basic contract, the funds citation will be entered in the Accounting Classification Field

       workloads will not be reported in CAV AF but will be reported in IMACS. Software
       repair performed as part of an overall CDM repair or programmed maintenance should be
       reported in CAV AF to capture accurate repair costs. Contract labor to perform software-
       only repairs does not require CAV AF reporting and will be tracked at the NSN level of
       accountability.
       A2.4.1.5. Attachments to PR. Whenever possible, attachments will be prepared on
       approved forms designed for such use. Otherwise, they will be prepared on plain
       reproducible paper (AFMC Form 36 will not be used to prepare attachments). The
       applicable PR number will be placed in the lower right hand corner of each page of the
       attachments, unless there is a space provided on the form. Attachments to Planning PR
       will be as follows:
           A2.4.1.5.1. Continuation sheets from face page of PR (i.e., shipping schedule,
           remarks, etc.) should be accomplished on bond paper and attached.

        A2.4.1.5.8. A representative from the Packaging Office should be included in the
        CRT in order to discuss requirements and to provide all necessary packaging forms.
            A2.4.1.5.8.1. Commercial packaging for direct shipments should be considered
            (determination to be made IAW MIL-STD-2073-1 by the responsible packaging
            management function).

     A2.4.1.6. Appendix A/PWS. The PWS will state directions and procedures the
     contractor must follow to perform the work requirements, including quality, security,
     acceptance and testing requirements. MIL-HDBK-245D, Preparation of Statement of
     Work (SOW), contains guidance for creating a completed contract PWS applicable to any
     material acquisition life-cycle phase. It also covers the PWS preparation for non-personal
     services contracts. The PWS should include the scope of repair work and contract repair
     tenets that are agreed upon by the CRT and to be applied to the acquisition. Note: It is
     important the CRT considers the additional charges a contractor proposes for requested
     data as breaching the 75% of the Suggested List Price (SLP) not economical to repair
     threshold. If the CRT decides to repair beyond the threshold, clear and thorough
     justification should be included with appropriate management signature levels for dollar
     threshold. The following should be considered when preparing an Appendix A:
        A2.4.1.6.1. Work Specification/PWS should be attached.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                  87

        and complete.
        A2.4.1.6.4. Include contractor requirements for access to and use of CAV AF
        production and GFM reporting and requisitioning. Note: This requires a CDRL and
        DID. System requirements and instructions should be addressed in Appendix B or
        CAV AF PWS.
        A2.4.1.6.5. MICAPs will be identified to the contractor and work priorities will be
        set by direction of the PMS/MM to ensure "repair on demand" versus "batch repairs".
        A2.4.1.6.6. MM/PMS will provide shipping instructions by FAX or other electronic
        means to the contractor within XX days (XX is locally determined) before

        cannibalization.
        A2.4.1.6.8. All potential destinations will be listed on the PR and Appendix A so the
        contractor can have labels prepared in advance of MM/PMS shipping instructions.
        A2.4.1.6.9. Specification changes and minor modifications will be handled under
        "Over and above Work Procedures" and will be incorporated by the PCO as Changes
        Orders for ACO definitization under "Over and Above".

        competitive PRs.
        A2.4.1.6.11. If the CRT decides to include CSI as a tenet, the Contractor may act as
        the CSI to store serviceables and will ship to the field upon demand within two (2)
        working days after MM/PMS (or software system) gives the demand.
        A2.4.1.6.12. Contractor will be allowed to move components among reparable end
        items to expedite repair versus maintaining serial number integrity.
        A2.4.1.6.13. Include the Deliverable Data Requirements list as attachment # 1 to
        Appendix A.
        A2.4.1.6.14. Include the DODAAC list as attachment # 2 to Appendix A.

            be included. Notes: If GFM is provided; NSN, P/N and quantity should be
            annotated. Need to identify the categories of GFM (EOQ, RECOVERABLE
            authorized to MIL-STRIP, or RECOVERABLE, if GFE/ST/STE are provided,
            NSN, PN, quantity, condition code, unit price and contract line item (if available)
            should be annotated, specify availability and plan of action to ship to contractor
            by need date, specify whether GFE, ST/STE is serviceable or not and indicate
            plan of action to return item(s) to serviceable condition by need date, advance
            funding for CFM may be required in the amount of $____, and express

     data cost and eliminate any unnecessary data. The following are usually required for
     repair acquisitions but are not inclusive:
        A2.4.1.9.1. DI-MGMT-81634B, CAV AF will be used for GFM and end item
        transactions.
        A2.4.1.9.2. DI-MISC-81371.
        A2.4.1.9.3. DI-MGMT-80791. Additional Data Requirements for Aircraft: Aviation

        personnel, training, and availability of government-furnished tooling, test equipment,
        government equipment, and GFM. If tooling, test equipment, government equipment,
        and GFM cannot be provided in a serviceable condition, in time to meet schedule,
        then the schedule is unrealistic and should be revised. The delivery schedule should
        be based on the MMs requirements. If the contractor cannot meet the requirements, a
        second source may be needed.
        A2.4.1.10.2. CRT should provide Buyer/PCO a realistic delivery schedule based on
        GFE/ST/STE availability, phase-in considerations of a new contractor and projected
        input to contractor on task (delivery) orders.
        A2.4.1.10.3. The CRT should consider a ―ramp-up‖ type schedule with decreasing
        target flow days over a defined time period to aid in new contractor‘s phase-in
        process.
     A2.4.1.11. Government in-house PAS. The CRT will comply with the in-house PAS
     concept as referenced in this instruction. The CRT should outline all elements of
     compliance on plain bond paper and attach it to the PR.

CONTRACT MAINTENANCE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS FOR MOD/PDM AIRCRAFT
                   AND ENGINE OVERHAUL

A3.1. Sequence of Events and OPRs. Are listed as a guide and may vary by ALC to fit
peculiar operating conditions. However, the total number of days allowed for contract actions
must be adhered to. The milestones are predicated upon a negotiated competitive procurement,
estimated to exceed $100,000, and employing a RFQ type solicitation. For negotiated
procurements over $2 million dollars, add 15 days to each action from numbers 1-36. For source
selection, add 35 days to each action from numbers 1-36; the standard days for procurement
action would be from that point to contract award at day 0. The total standard days are
established by HQ AFMC/PK. The number of days for internal procurement actions within the
total standard may be established locally.

            CHECKLIST FOR CONTRACT REPAIR TEAM (CRT) MEETING

A4.1. Checklist: Been developed for guidance to personnel preparing PRs and may be varied
depending upon the nature of the requirements.
A4.2. Nature and History of Repair Item:
     A4.2.1. Has the team discussed the acquisition concept for this program, i.e., PBSA or non-
     PBSA, GFM, GFE, contract length, whether end item is serviceable on input, insurance
     policy concept? If not, does the PR reflect the concept of Appendix A?
     A4.2.2. What items are involved and how do they fit into the system (end item)?
     A4.2.3. What programs and using commands are supported? Is there a sense of urgency
     involved and why?
     A4.2.4. Have we previously contracted this work out and if so who was our contractor,
     contract number? What was the experience with this contractor?
        A4.2.4.1. Did the contractor meet the original contract schedules? If not, state if
        government or contractor or both were responsible for delays. Identify each delay and the
        cause and corrective action taken. State whether or not additional corrective action
        remains to be taken. If schedule was extended by contract modification, identify the
        consideration for such a modification, if applicable. If contractor was paid for claim,
        explain.
        A4.2.4.2. Were the problems due to the nature of the item, the contractor, or the
        government?
        A4.2.4.3. What type of contract was it? Was it satisfactory?
        A4.2.4.4. Were engineering problems involved?          If so, state the problem and how
        resolved.
        A4.2.4.5. Did transportation/traffic management adversely affect the program? If so,
        identify the problem and how it was resolved.
     A4.2.5. What is the Air Force estimated unit of cost to do the job and how was it calculated?
     How does this compare with the price of a new item? (75 percent acquisition cost factor may
     show here.)
A4.3. PR Package:
     A4.3.1. Are all NSNs with possible requirements for this system covered on this PR?
     A4.3.2. Is a requirements contract being asked for? If not, should it be asked for? If the
     system will transfer to organic repair during the life of the requirements contract, be sure to
     include the contract clauses for transition of the workload from contract to organic.
     A4.3.3. Are quantities flexible enough to cover both an increase and a decrease in
     requirements (min/max)?
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                         97


   A4.3.4. Are the first production testing or ATPs being asked for? If so, allow enough
   notification time before testing to allow government planning? (If you have ATPs or test
   reports ensure the correct funding is used.)
   A4.3.5. Are minimum essential requirements needed to evaluate the contractor?
   A4.3.6. Does the delivery schedule conflict with other delivery schedules, such as ATPs or
   other data requirements? Does the delivery schedule adequately state the delivery
   requirements both in time and quantities?
   A4.3.7. If other funds besides CDM are on the PR, are the line items identifiable to
   appropriate paragraphs in the Appendix A or PWS?
   A4.3.8. For MOD installs, are the correct funds paying for safety of flight, receipt of aircraft,
   fuel, etc.?
   A4.3.9. If a copy of solicitation is needed, add a remark requesting a copy of the solicitation
   before mailing to sources.
   A4.3.10. Type of contract required and source selection procedures to be used?
   A4.3.11. Are contract clauses needed to cover evaluation of the contractor's performance at
   the contractor's facility?
   A4.3.12. Have considerations been given for inclusion of Demonstration of Responsibility
   Clause? The responsibility of potential contractors must always be considered.
   A4.3.13. Is the liquidated damages clause required? If actual damages can be determined
   then the liquidated damage clause is not required. Has the actual dollar damage the
   government would sustain been documented? It is AFMC policy that this clause be used on
   MOD/PDM and aircraft engine overhaul contracts where timely delivery is of the utmost
   importance.
A4.4. Remarks Field:
   A4.4.1. The Remarks Field (AFMC Form 36) is used to furnish information to the

       IN-HOUSE PRE-AWARD SURVEY (PAS) INSTRUCTIONS CHECKLIST

A5.1. Purpose:
   A5.1.1. The in-house PAS outlines the government‘s obligations to fully support contracts
   awarded for CDM. The primary purpose of the PAS is to verify the ALC has the capability
   and necessary resources to fulfill its part of the contractual agreement made between the Air
   Force and maintenance contractors. Once the PAS is completed, the PMS will certify the
   necessary action have been taken to ensure full support of the proposed contract. Completion
   of the PAS reinforces the ALC‘s commitment to the success of the CDM program. Specific
   information pertaining to PAS can be found in FAR Part 9.106.
A5.2. Scope of Survey and when Required:
   A5.2.1. The scope and depth of a PAS may vary under certain circumstances. Contractual
   obligations may be with sole source, a new source, or a source that has performed on the
   same or like items in the past. Past experience performance will dictate the degree of review
   required in the completion of the PAS.
   A5.2.2. PASs are mandatory for proposed contract negotiations for modifications/periodic
   depot maintenance for aircraft and engines. Use of the PAS for other programs will be
   determined by the PMS in conjunction with the CRT. Use of the PAS needs to be tailored to
   meet the peculiar circumstances of each prospective maintenance contract. Success in the use
   of the PAS rests with the judgment of the PMS and CRT.
A5.3. Evaluation Ratings. The following criteria will be used to grade or rate the measurable
items of the PAS:
   A5.3.1. Satisfactory: If items on the MRL are in long supply and availability is guaranteed,
   this response should be selected.
   A5.3.2. Unsatisfactory: If the availability of items on the MRL is in question or cannot be
   guaranteed, this response should be selected.
   A5.3.3. First Source: If availability of material on the MRL is in doubt but it is desired that
   the government be used as a first source for the contractor, this response should be selected.
A5.4. PAS Participation:
   A5.4.1. Development of the PAS will require the participation of the CRT. The CRT will
   review the various items on the checklist and submit findings to the CRT Lead.
A5.5. Survey Responsibilities:
   A5.5.1. SPM:
       A5.5.1.1. Review PAS inputs provided by the CRT.
       A5.5.1.2. Complete certification of the PAS and forward to the appropriate CO.
       A5.5.1.3. Work with the contracting office to resolve those areas found unsatisfactory.
       A5.5.1.4. Follow up on these areas and any other areas requiring special emphasis. This
       may require the preparation of a listing containing special and critical factors concerning
106                                                           AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


       criteria, work tasks, ST/STE, peculiar spares/spare parts, essential facilities,
       manpower/skill requirements, and other areas essential to managing a CDM program.
       A5.5.1.5. Notify the CO of any changes that could affect the government‘s ability to
       meet its contractual obligations.
   A5.5.2. Other directorates and staff offices will:
       A5.5.2.1. Provide timely responses for data requests from the PMS/CRT.
       A5.5.2.2. Identify problem areas and recommended solutions.

2. CONTRACT DESIGNATION GFM or CFM:

2.1. Current AF direction is to pursue performance based contracts using a CFM concept. This
requires the contractor to provide all needed material as part of the cost of repair. Government
and Contractor personnel should strive to transition GFM to CFM at every available opportunity.

2.2. This contract has been designated as a CFM or as a GFM contract as indicated on the cover
of this appendix and as detailed in the basic contract.

2.3. Under the terms of CFM, no material, as defined above, is to be provided to the contractor
except line items on the contract, which are subject to repair. Under the terms of GFM, only
material listed on the appropriate attachment as authorized by NSN and quantity can be provided
to the contractor in support of the repair requirement.

2.4. Any NSN or quantity changes to the authorized GFM Listing (Attachment 3) shall require a
contract modification identifying the change. Changes must be coordinated through the
appropriate managing ALC offices. Note: The PMS must provide any changes to the Appendix
B Authorized GFM Listing (Attachment 3) to the PCO for documentation until contract
modification can be accomplished at an appropriate time.

3.0 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY

3.1. Contractor requisition/procurement of GFP/GFM is limited to only the initial NSN and
quantities authorized as listed to this Appendix B, and as an attachment to Appendix B for non-
Air Force managed consumable GFM authorized with an approved GFM waiver signed by ALC
senior management (Group level) and approved by HQ AFMC/A4D IAW AFMCI 21-149. Note:
Changes to consumable GFM as authorized by an approved waiver will not require contract
modification. Documentation of changes to consumable GFM authorizations must be: dated and
signed by the managing contract PMS, maintained in the contract/delivery order folder, updated
in CAV AF, and the delivery of the updated consumable GFM listing to the repair contractor
documented.

3.1.1. It is DoD policy that contractors should furnish all material required for the performance
of government contracts. GFM is authorized on CDM contracts only when it is in the best
interest of the government by reason of economy, standardization, the expediting of production,
or other appropriate circumstances. AF-managed, MSD consumables can be authorized as GFM
and do not require a HQ AMFC/A4D waiver.

3.2. Only GFM authorized in Attachment 3 of this appendix can be provided to the contractor
unless designated in an approved waiver as stated above. The contractor will not requisition,
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                       121


procure, nor be provided with, any other materials by the government. All GFM, as government
property, will be retained in a secured storage area.

3.2.1. The authorized GFM listing will be prepared IAW chapter 3 of AMCI 21-149 and
maintained in CAV AF by the PMS and/or CAV AF CM. Upon execution of the contract, any
changes to the initial Appendix B GFM authorized listing (update required in CAV AF by NIIN
and Qty) will be provided by the PMS to the PCO for documentation until a bi-lateral contract
modification can be accomplished at an appropriate time. Note: Authorized Modification kits,
(BC S) must be identified and included in the GFM listing, in order to be incorporated into the
CAV AF ToA.

3.2.2. Only Air Force managed items will be identified as GFM. Contractors are encouraged to
procure these items online through the DOD EMALL,
(https://emall6.prod.dodonline.net/main). When possible provide NSN to ensure receipt of
proper item.

3.3. The Contractor shall comply with the following 60-day rule: within 60-days of a CAV AF
issue transaction for an ERRC Code T GFM item, the contractor shall submit a CAV AF GFM
Turn In transaction to return the replaced unserviceable unit to the reparable inventory.

3.4. Contractor shall use a 2L advice code for all normal GFM requisitions. In the event of
production stoppage due to delayed GFM, the contractor shall submit a 2C (fill or kill) advice
code. The requisition quantity should not exceed the quantity required to relieve the production
slippage or work stoppage.

3.5. For authorization of GFE on this contract, the PMS is to contact the ALC LCO for
government loan property authorization. The contractor shall comply with the GFE-related
clauses in the basic contract. While the GFE is in the possession of the contractor, it is the
contractor‘s responsibility to provide routine maintenance and calibration of the GFE to ensure
the GFE is returned to the government in the same condition as when provided, less normal wear
and tear. GFE will not be requisitioned until it is actually required and will be turned in when no
longer required.

3.6. Stock Levels of GFM:

3.6.1. Stock levels of ERRC Code T GFM will be determined by dividing one year‘s production
requirement by 6 to obtain 60-day production requirement. Example, one year‘s production
requirement is 12 (12 divided by 6 equates to 2 for 60 day production quantity).

3.6.1.1. Divide each NSN quantity authorized on the MRL by the total production quantity to
obtain an authorized quantity for each repaired item. Example, total NSN quantity on the MRL is
72 and total production quantity is 12 (72 divided by 12 equates to 6 NSN quantity authorized
for each repaired item).

3.6.2. The maximum stock levels of GFM authorized on this contract are a combined total of
material on hand and/or on order at any one time. Minimum stock levels will be maintained as a
122                                                              AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


normal procedure. Maximum levels can only be maintained when contractor usage and/or
reorder time experience justifies a need to prevent production slippage/work stoppage and/or
authorized by the contracting ALC through the ACO.

3.6.3. Authorized NSN and quantities listed in Attachment 3 of this appendix may vary as
contact workout is adjusted. The contractor must adjust the stock on hand as these changes occur.
Quantities of ERRC Code T GFM which go unused or un-needed for 180-days will be identified
by the contractor to the PMS as excess to the needs of the contract.

3.7. Reorder Points:

3.7.1. Reorder for additional GFM will be based on receipt of task (delivery) orders or the
advanced notice of pending task (delivery) orders.

3.7.2. If projected production requirements of contract line items are not received during the first
60 days, no additional GFM will be ordered or procured and in stock GFM will be maintained
for the next 60 days.

3.7.3. If projected production requirements of contract line items are not received during the first
120 days, all GFM will be determined excess and the contractor shall request disposition
instructions from the PMS.

3.7.4. When the stock on hand is insufficient to repair additional contract line items above the
projected production requirements, the following method will be used:

3.7.4.1. Divide each NSN quantity authorized on the MRL by the total production quantity to
obtain an authorized quantity for each repaired item. Example, total NSN quantity on the MRL is
72 and total production quantity is 12 (72 divided by 12 equates to 6 NSN quantity authorized
for each repaired item).

3.7.4.2. The quantity to be reordered will be the quantity required to support the additional line
items. Example, additional line items are 4 multiplied by GFM replacement quantity of 6 (4 x 6
= 24). Authorized reorder quantity would be 24.

3.7.5. A reduced pipeline time shall be used whenever the contractor‘s experience reflects
pipeline time is less than authorized above. An increase to the authorized pipeline time must be
approved by the PMS through the ACO.

3.8. Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority System (UMMIPS):

3.8.1. The contract buying office assigns FADs to contracts for use in determining the proper
requisition priority. Requisition priority is determined by relating the FAD to the UND.

3.8.2. For example, on FAD II, only use priority 02, 05, and 12.

3.8.2.1. UND A and FAD II equal Priority 02. Use this priority when a work stoppage exists or
will exist if material is not received within eight days.

3.8.2.2. UND B and FAD II equal Priority 05. Use this priority when production capability will
be impaired if material is not received within normal order and shipping times.

3.8.2.3. UND C and FAD II equal Priority 12. Use this priority when requisitioning initial
operating stock and for normal stock replenishment.

3.8.3. The objective of proper stock control is having all requirements planned well in advance
where only the lowest priority (12) is used. The use of high priority for stock replenishment is
poor stock management and serves to defeat the priority system. Note: FAD Codes change by
contract. Please verify FAD and UND.

3.9. Supply Status Codes:

3.9.1. An advice code must be entered in the Advice Code Field of the requisition screen in CAV
AF to provide instructions to the SOS when such data is considered essential to a supply action.
A status code is inserted in the same field by the SOS to advise the contractor of the action taken
after the requisition was processed.

3.9.2. Once requisitions are input, there is a continuing need to monitor the returned status codes.
This is because each requisition must pass an edit check to ensure the item and quantity is valid
under the terms of the contract. Also, some supply status codes may ask the requisitioner to
revalidate, provide additional information, or further justify the request for the item or quantity
requisitioned. Failure to reply can cause the requisition to be cancelled.

3.10. Physical Inventory Control.

3.10.1. Physical inventory control of all GFP and end items in the possession of the contractor
must be performed IAW DoD 4000.25.M, DoD 4140.1-R and AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part
1, Chapter 6. Physical inventory of all applicable GFP against CAV AF records must be
conducted at least annually to verify accurate inventory balances. The inventory accuracy goal
for all GFP with a unit price > $1000.00 is 99% and 95% for all other material IAW D0D
124                                                              AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


4000.25-M. It is highly recommended the inventory sampling be conducted throughout the year
to ensure proper processing of inventory records is occurring.

3.10.2. The PMS will coordinate with DCMA to actively participate in a review of inventory
records before processing inventory adjustments. Note: The contractor will not be given
authority to process inventory adjustment (D8/D9) transactions in CAV AF.

by the PMS to prepare a standardized work specifications document to be included as Tab A for
Organic Depot Maintenance and Appendix A for contractual maintenance with civilian industry.
(Note: The section titles must match AFI 63-124. All else may be tailored to specific
requirements.) Work Specifications outline the maintenance requirements, and are developed
IAW these instructions. The information contained in the document for each paragraph of the
work specifications document may be varied to fit the specific needs of each ALC; however,
variations must be kept to a minimum to ensure standardization of the Depot Maintenance
program for the AFMC.
   A8.2.1. Maintenance Terms and Explanations. Use definitions found in Air Force and
   AFMC 20 and 21 series directives to explain and/or expand work specification identified in
   Appendix A.
   A8.2.2. CDM CRT simplified flow diagram. The CRT shall determine if the maintenance
   requirement requires performance based specifications and Services Contracting Act
   compliance.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                    135

   A8.3.1. Role. These specifications are of prime importance in securing maintenance services
   under the Air Force Depot Maintenance Concept of Operations. Work specifications govern
   the scope of maintenance, serve as a basis for competitive contracting, and are worded to aid
   in determining cost allocation. The maintenance work specifications, when appended to a
   contract, do not place any obligation upon or provide instructions to government activities or
   personnel. This appendix is used by the PMS to state explicitly to the depot maintenance to
   be accomplished on government equipment. The PMS coordinates with the CRT members to
   form this specification. The work requirement must be developed by the SE. The TOs and
   Directives must be coordinated with the ES. In dealing with ALC organic facility managers,
   customer commands, or private industry, work specifications are the most critical item in
   maintenance negotiations and the most frequent source of disputes if not specific and
   encompassing agreed-to maintenance requirements.
      A8.3.1.1. The maintenance work specification must provide full and detailed description
      of the work to be done by the maintenance facility. As such, hurricane evacuation plans,
      safety requirements, and all other material not concerned with work requirements are
      excluded. TOs and other directives which apply to such excluded material will not be
      cited. The work specification technician determines the requirements essential for
      detailed description of work, for example, inclusion of safety requirements. Safety
      requirements which involve the general facility capabilities will not be included in the
      work specifications. The requirements may be included in the Appendix C which is
      prepared by the safety office of the managing ALC. Examples of these capability
      requirements are: runway length, hangar space, fire fighting equipment, and fuel system
      maintenance facility.
      A8.3.1.2. If two of more organizations (organic or contract) are selected to do the same
      kind of maintenance on the same type of equipment, they will use the same work
      specification. Prepare an addendum to the specification when facility/capability
      differences are authorized between maintenance facilities where the same type of work is
      to be performed. Use the same format as for the work specification when preparing an
      addendum. Enter requirements in corresponding sections of the work specification.
      A8.3.1.3. When work specifications are prepared for aircraft, engines, missiles, or
      equipment under the provisions of this directive include provisions for support of
      embedded computer resources.
      A8.3.1.4. All TOs and other directives identified in the specification apply only to work
      being accomplished. List all applicable contractor specifications, handbooks, drawings,
      or other pertinent contractor data. If only part of the contractor data is required then cite
      only the appropriate portion.
      A8.3.1.5. Ensure all forms referenced in the work specification are current.
   A8.3.2. Use of Maintenance Work Specifications. The work specification is used by the
   contracting activity, the maintenance facility, the ACO, and Air Force personnel.
      A8.3.2.1. The contracting activity uses the work specification to solicit proposals or bids
      and as a basis for contract award.
      A8.3.2.2. The contractor uses the description of the work for preparing and submitting a
      proposal and for doing the work outlined in the document.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                   137


     A8.3.2.3. The ACO, or a duly authorized representative, ensures contractor performance
     is IAW the requirements described in the work specification. Within organic maintenance
     facilities, the PAO makes sure the work is done according to the work specifications.
     A8.3.2.4. The SPM/IMS gives direction for maintenance to be performed and ensures
     the work is done as specified.
     A8.3.2.5. Guard against unnecessary repair or repaint for cosmetic purposes.
     A8.3.2.6. The customer command uses the work specification to identify work
     performed on their equipment.
  A8.3.3. Preparation. The maintenance work specification is compiled by the PMS in the
  ALC Directorate responsible for the end item.
     A8.3.3.1. Work specification formats are driven by the type of equipment; however, the
     information contained in each specification is essentially the same. General information
     is provided to cover data, definitions, maintenance records, forms, and reporting/security
     requirements. Specific and detailed instructions are given on work requirements. A listing
     of the applicable TOs and directives is included as part of the work specification.
     A8.3.3.2. Submit changes to the specifications by placing revised pages in the basic
     specification instead of the original pages. File the original pages until the work is
     completed. The revised pages will contain the date of the revision. A new specification is
     prepared when equipment is put on schedule for which a current work specification is not
     available or when the organization issuing the specification believes a reissue is
     necessary. Each revision to a work specification will be indicated on the title page and
     must include the revision number and date.
     A8.3.3.3. The SPM/IMS determines if revisions to the work specifications are necessary
     to incorporate TCTOs, TO changes, or supplements. The added cost of such changes will
     be negotiated with the maintenance facility.
     A8.3.3.4. Each ALC will keep a complete and orderly file of active work specifications.
     This file will conform to administrative guidelines outlined in AFI 33-322, Records
     Management Program. Duplicate files are not authorized, however; working copies may
     be kept on hand by work specification authors for their use. A PR number is used as the
     file number and is assigned to all appendices. When revisions are issued, number them
     consecutively starting with 01. The basic specification may be re-issued (incorporating
     changes) to reduce materials affecting the work specifications. The preparing
     organization will cite the office symbol, the author of the specification, and telephone
     number.
     A8.3.3.5. The use of formats is encouraged; they allow the technician to complete
     appendices with a minimum of research and effort, and create a higher degree of
     standardization throughout the ALC.
     A8.3.3.6. The work specification, Tab A for organic work must be reviewed and
     approved according to AFMCI 21-110, Depot Maintenance Technical Data and Work
     Control Documents and AFMCI 21-133 Depot Maintenance Management For Aircraft
     Repair. The final date on the work specification should reflect the date of review and
     approval.
138                                                           AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


      A8.3.3.7. Ensure recurring type work is described in detail to reduce O&A charges to the
      original work package, allow the repair facility adequate data for planning and estimating
      costs and provide a complete and definitized work package on which bidders (organic,
      interservice, or contract) may be rated equally and fairly.
      A8.3.3.8. The preferred numbering system for paragraphs is the decimal system IAW
      MIL-STD-961A, Defense and Program-Unique Specifications Format and Content.
      Numbering for purposes of the work specification does not need to extend beyond four
      digits (i.e. 1.2.3.4.).
      A8.3.3.9. Ensure delivery of items to the SOR (organic depot, contractor, or DMISA
      site) is complete with all required records. The SPM/IMS is the contact point for the SOR
      for any missing records.
   A8.3.4. Importance of Work Specifications. The preparation of work specification suitable
   for use by maintenance contractors and organic facilities requires extensive research of
   applicable Air Force documents by technicians experienced in the type of work and
   equipment covered by the work specification. When the material has been collected,
   assimilated, and reduced to manageable dimensions, prepare the specification manuscript.
      A8.3.4.1. For the writing of standard paragraphs in work specifications, use standard
      words, phraseology and short paragraphs. The first sentence should contain the main
      thought. Vague phrases such as ―and/or‖ should not be used. Illustrations are useful;
      however, should be used sparingly. Existing art should be used whenever possible. Notes,
      cautions, and warnings in the text are used to draw attention to a particular instruction.
          A8.3.4.1.1. Note: An operating procedure or condition that must be highlighted.
          A8.3.4.1.2. Caution: Operating procedures or practices which must be observed to
          avoid damaging equipment.
          A8.3.4.1.3. Warning: Operation procedure or practice which must be observed to
          avoid personal injury or loss of life.
   A8.3.5. Editing and Technical Review. The PMS and coordinating organization will ensure
   each work specification is edited and reviewed for proper format, content and technical
   accuracy.
   A8.3.6. Performance Based Services Contracting for Maintenance over the Simplified
   Acquisition Threshold (currently $100K).
      A8.3.6.1. Tailor these PWS tenants into a Performance Based Work Specification (ref.
      AFI 63-124).
          A8.3.6.1.1. Comply to the maximum extent practicable with the terms and conditions
          of the commercial marketplace as identified through market research.
          A8.3.6.1.2. Describe all work in terms of ―what‖ the required service output is rather
          than ―how‖ the work is to be performed or the number of hours to be provided, except
          when deemed essential by functional activity for safety and/or security reasons.
          A8.3.6.1.3. Include measurable performance objectives and financial or other
          incentives to encourage contractors to develop and institute innovative and cost
          effective methods of performing the work. For any method used to develop a PWS,
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                   139


         the performance threshold is either developed or approved by the government and
         shall conform to commercial or industry-wide standards to the maximum extent
         practicable.
         A8.3.6.1.4. Include historic and projected work load data to include surge and other
         requirements.
         A8.3.6.1.5. Cite reference instructions, publications, etc., by specific paragraph or
         chapter rather than the entire publication.
         A8.3.6.1.6. Use the experience and lessons learned from previous contracts to
         develop the PWS.
      A8.3.6.2. Service Delivery Summary (SDS) Development Worksheet. The service
      requirements are summarized into performance outcomes which relate directly to mission
      essential items. The performance thresholds describe the minimum acceptable levels of
      service required for each requirement. The thresholds are critical to mission success and
      acceptable (satisfactory) performance. Note: Method of surveillance will only be
      included in the QASP.

        unless other written disposition instructions are provided by the PCO through the
        ACO. Requests for condemnation shall be submitted by the contractor, in writing,
        through the ACO to the PCO. Condemnation may only be granted if the condition of
        the item inducted for repair has physical damage that affects greater than 75 percent
        of the material within the end item (i.e., crushed) or burn damage that affects greater
        than 80 percent of the internal electrical components and connections of the end item.
        Replacement costs are determined using TO 00-20-3, Maintenance Processing of
        Reparable Property and Repair Cycle Asset Control System. The PMS will advise
        ACOs of the criticality of items. The PMS will also provide contractors with up to
        date ―Save Lists‖. Condemnation and repair of items during organic maintenance will
        be IAW the above criteria unless modified by the SPM/IMS.
        A8.4.1.1.5. Accessory and Component Reuse, Repair and Replacement. Set up
        specific requirements for the reuse, repair, and replacement of accessories and
        components. Such requirements are obtained from TO 00-20-1, Web Access –
        Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policy and
        Procedures, and the specific publication for the equipment.
            A8.4.1.1.5.1. Expense parts of an end item determined unserviceable or missing
            shall be replaced with equivalent serviceable parts at no additional cost.
            Material/parts used for replacement shall be selected IAW the applicable
            illustrated parts breakdown TOs and only those part numbers identified therein
            will be used. Subassemblies shall be repaired as a part of the next higher
            assembly.
            A8.4.1.1.5.2. The contractor is authorized to cannibalize reparable LRUs/SRUs
            necessary to accomplish timely repair. All cannibalized components shall be
            returned to a pre-cannibalized condition.

            is to be repaired as job routed if serviceable assets are available and in long
            supply.‖
            A8.4.1.1.5.4. In order to determine those items with assets in long supply use the
            Management Reports provided in D200A. Request the reports from the ALC
            D200A system OPR. Submit requisition for serviceable items on a fill or kill basis
            so that the repair line is not jeopardized.
        A8.4.1.1.6. Aircraft Acceleration and Compression. If required, give specific
        directions allowing the Government to direct the contractor during critical needs,
        National Emergencies, or War. Acceleration deals with overtime, multiple shifts, and
        premium pay. Compression requires an additional Work Specification that can be
        invoked, directing which steps of maintenance can be deleted or tailored
        (compressed) from the routine work package. This may include performance based
        objective(s) with the contractor providing an estimated delivery date for expedited
        aircraft within 1-2 workdays. It could also address specific reductions in flow days.

              A8.5.1.1.1.2. List reports applicable to the contract maintenance requirement on
              the DD Form 1423. List reports applicable to organic maintenance requirements
              in the work specification complete with report title and applicable directive.
              A8.5.1.1.1.3. Establish the technical data standard to which maintenance will
              conform. The removal, disassembly, inspection, repair, adjustment, modification,
              test, assembly, and reinstallation of components and equipment will conform to
              the basic maintenance instructions and the applicable TOs listed in Section 4.0 of
              the work specification. Definitive requirements for NDI may be included to get
              greatest economic advantage from NDI methods and procedures. The governing
              directive for NDI is TO 33B-1-1. Follow this TO and those applicable to NDI for
              the particular engine when NDI processes and procedures are given in the work
              specification.
           A8.5.1.1.2. Security. The engine work specification will require the maintenance
           facility to comply with DD Form 254, if applicable.
           A8.5.1.1.3. Quality. Use the guidance in this attachment. Coordinate all work
           specifications with the Quality organization.
           A8.5.1.1.4. Condemnation and Repair. The specification will forbid the contractor to
           condemn items without prior approval of the ACO. Contractors will not be allowed to
           repair items where the cost of parts and labor exceeds 75 percent of the replacement
           cost of the item unless authorized by the ACO. Replacement costs will be determined
           using AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors. When the unit repair
           cost exceeds 75% of the actual unit price, the item should be considered a
           ―consumable‖ verses a ―repairable‖ based on economic reasons of ―throw away‖
           verses ―repair it‖. If an item breaches the 75% threshold, it is to be reviewed by the

A8.6. Instructions for Preparing Standard Maintenance Work Specs for EQUIPMENT.
   A8.6.1. Section 1.0 – DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES/GENERAL INFORMATION
   (DEFINITIONS, ETC.): The instructions for work may vary greatly depending on the type
   of equipment. The repair instructions required for maintenance of component or subassembly
   items will be much different in volume and content from those required for maintenance of a
   strategic missile or one of the C-E systems. Some items of equipment have a requirement for
   limited repair and thus the repair instructions must be limited accordingly. All of the above
   factors may affect the work specification. The format for equipment work specifications
   accompanying instructions must be used as a guide in writing maintenance work
   specifications for equipment other than aircraft and engines; however, these work
   specifications will also require detailed definition and standardization. Variances from the
   standard format and instructions are permissible only where absolutely necessary. State
   exactly what is to be done and how it is to be done. This will minimize O&A work and
   prevent misunderstanding between the Government and the contractor.
      A8.6.1.1. General Work Requirements. Provide information on the type of work required
      such as PDM, repair or overhaul. Indicate the extent of the work or, if necessary, the
      concept of maintenance and any limiting factors. For instance, minor defects will not be
      cause for rejection if final tests are passed, or that restoration to like new condition is not
      required.
           A8.6.1.1.1. Data:
              A8.6.1.1.1.1. Maintenance Forms. Instruct the maintenance facility to maintain
              forms listed below, as applicable, during the time the equipment is at the
              contractor‘s facility. Other DD or AFTO forms may be added to this list. Include
              requirements for maintenance data reporting according to TO 00-20-2:

          equipment will conform to the basic maintenance instructions manual and other
          applicable TOs listed in Section 4.0 of the work specification. Include complete
          requirements for NDI to get the greatest economic advantage from NDI methods
          and procedures. Get these requirements from the applicable NDI TO or other
          directive for the equipment.
       A8.6.1.1.2. Security. The maintenance facility will comply with DD Form 254, if
       applicable.
       A8.6.1.1.3. Quality. Use the guidance in this attachment. Coordinate all work
       specifications with the Quality organization.
       A8.6.1.1.4. Condemnation and Repair. The specification will forbid the contractor to
       condemn items without prior approval of the ACO. Contractors will not be allowed to
       repair items where the cost of parts and labor exceed 75 percent of the replacement
       cost of the items unless authorized by the ACO. Determine replacement costs using
       AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors. The PMS will advise the
       ACOs of the criticality of items. Condemnation and repair of items during organic
       maintenance will be IAW these criteria unless modified by the PMS. The provisions
       of TO 00-25-240, Uniform Repair/Replacement Criteria for Selected USAF Support
       Equipment (SE), apply for applicable SE items unless specifically waived by the IMS.
       Work specifications will contain the following statement: ―No item is to be repaired
       as job routed if serviceable assets are available and in long supply.‖
          A8.6.1.1.4.1. In order to determine those items with assets in long supply use the
          Management Reports provided in D200A. Request the reports from the ALC
          D200A system OPR.
          A8.6.1.1.4.2. Submit requisitions for serviceable items on a fill or kill basis so
          that the repair line is not jeopardized.
       A8.6.1.1.5. Accessory and Component Reuse, Repair and Replacement: Set up
       specific requirements for the reuse, repair, and replacement of accessories and
       components. Such requirements are obtained from TO 00-20-1 and the specific
       publication for the equipment.

      A8.6.5.1. Section 5.0 will contain a list of attachments with any applicable publications,
      workload estimates, maps and work area layouts, government furnished property listings,
      etc. If publications are listed, they need to be identified by specific paragraph or chapter
      and should reference back to the paragraph in the SOO/PWS that requires compliance
      with the publication. Required reports (CDRLs and DIDs) should not be listed as an
      attachment or appendix. They should be listed in an exhibit to the solicitation IAW
      DFARS 204.7105 in Section J of the Uniform Contract Format. AFI 63-124 requires that
      all referenced instructions, publications, etc. be cited by specific paragraph or chapter
      rather than the entire publication. This drives the CRT to eliminate all unnecessary
      publications that do not pertain to the PWS.

      Furnished Property, if applicable and Appendix C, Safety, if applicable.
      A8.6.5.6. Attachment One - TOs and Other Directives:
         A8.6.5.6.1. Maintenance of TOs and other directives. The work specification will
         require the maintenance facility to keep current TOs and other technical directives
         (TO-00-5-1-WA-1). This requires review of TOs and directives issued during the
         time the work is being done. The review will consider the impact on other work
         requirements, cost, schedules, and any other pertinent factors. Send a written
         evaluation along with specific backup data for those changes (increases or decreases)
         which impact the performance of the maintenance facility to the ACO/PAO within 10
         workdays after receipt. The maintenance facility will not begin work IAW the TO
         revision until the TO is approved by the ACO/PAO.
             A8.6.5.6.1.1. Furnish the maintenance facility with a complete list of the TOs and
             other directives needed to perform the maintenance required by the contract. If the
             TO or directive is referred to in the work specification, include the TO or
             directive in the list. List only TOs and other directives referenced above in
             Section 1.0 through Section 4.0 IAW AFI 63-124. However, when an extract of a

                CONTRACT REPAIR/TECHNICAL SCREENING POLICY
                           FORMAT/INSTRUCTIONS

A9.1. General. Technical screening must be performed to ensure that the repair has the
documented technical requirements. The technical authority is responsible for providing the
technical screening requirements. The ultimate responsibility for the weapon system is the PM.
Under Operational Safety, Suitability, & Effectiveness (OSS&E) assurance policy, the
responsibility for all technical issues is delegated to the Chief Engineer of the responsible system
or Lead Engineer of the end-item. Technical authority to define and document the technical
requirements may be delegated by the Chief Engineer of the responsible system or Lead
Engineer of the end item to those having technical competence and capability to perform the
required activities (ref. AFMCI 63-1201, Implementing Operational Safety Suitability and
Effectiveness (OSS&E) and Life Cycle Systems Engineering).
   A9.1.1. The range and depth of technical information required in support of repair is almost
   unlimited. This attachment provides a baseline process and set of policy guidelines. The
   objective of this attachment is to establish an effective mechanism to determine and
   document RMC/RMSC and approved sources to support the acquisition of repair actions.
   A9.1.2. Technical screening actions for repair actions are referred to as "Contract Repair
   Screening". The technical screening actions should be completed prior to procurement of
   contracted repair services.
A9.2. Contract Repair Screening Policy.
   A9.2.1. The Materiel Support Group at each ALC will be responsible for developing
   processes and procedures for the following: AFMC Form 762 and initiation/requests for
   screening, AFMC Form 762 status, AFMC Form 762 training, and an AFMC Form 762 data
   archive. The procedures contained herein define responsibilities and prescribes procedures
   for preparing and processing an AFMC Form 762 for items having ERRC Codes C, P, S, T
   and U. It is applicable to the PMS, Cognizant Engineer, ES, and Screening Technician. The
   form can be accessed on the AFMC Publications and Forms Web Site (http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil/).
   A9.2.2. This policy applies to items that have been through the Source of Repair Assignment
   Process (SORAP) and are deemed to be partially or completely contractor repair. This
   process implements a program to screen repairable assets prior to procurement of contract
   repair services. The AFMC Form 762 will document the factors and results of the decision
   process regarding the requirements for each item subject to contract repair.
   A9.2.3. Screening Criteria thresholds are weapons system dependent. Occasionally, an item
   will not meet strict economic considerations for screening, but screening actions may be
   required due to other considerations such as overpricing. Each ALC will develop minimum
   thresholds which are consistent with economic considerations and resources. These will be
   documented by a local policy.
   A9.2.4. AFMC Form 762 will be completed by the appropriate PMS, Cognizant Engineer,
   ES, and Screening Technician. The appropriate RMC/RMSC must be determined and
   justified based on the availability and adequacy of resources required to effect timely repair
164                                                          AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


   and high quality workmanship. No PR for contract repair will be processed without a current
   and accurate AFMC Form 762 unless specifically exempted. Copies of the completed form
   and associated documentation will be kept in a central data Master Repository (MR).
   A9.2.5. Specific exemptions to the Repair Screening Analysis Process:
      A9.2.5.1. Foreign Military Sales peculiar items
      A9.2.5.2. Insurance Items (exception for Acquisition Advice Code (AAC): Z items).
      A9.2.5.3. Obsolete items.

         A9.2.6.4.5. RMC/RMSC Code Field (28). Enter the appropriate RMC/RMSC using
         the definitions listed below:
             A9.2.6.4.5.1. RMC R0 – The part was not assigned RMC 1 through 5 when it
             entered the inventory, nor has it ever completed screening. Use of this code is
             sometimes necessary, but discouraged. Maximum effort to determine the
             applicability of an alternate RMC is the objective. This code will never be used to
             recode a part that already has RMC 1 through 5 assigned, and shall never be
             assigned as a result of breakout screening. Maximum effort to determine the
             applicability of RMC 1 through 5 is the objective.
             A9.2.6.4.5.2. RMC R1 - Suitable for competitive repair for the second or
             subsequent time.
             A9.2.6.4.5.3. RMC R2 - Suitable for competitive repair for the first time.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                    167


          A9.2.6.4.5.4. RMC R3 - Repair, for the second or subsequent time, directly from
          the actual manufacturer.
          A9.2.6.4.5.5. RMC R4 - Repair, for the first time, directly from the actual
          manufacturer.
          A9.2.6.4.5.6. RMC R5 - Repair directly from a sole source contractor which is
          not the actual manufacturer.
          A9.2.6.4.5.7. Repair method suffix codes. The following codes shall be assigned
          to further describe the repair method code. Valid combinations of RMCs/RMSCs
          are indicated below. When two or more RMSCs apply, the most technically
          restricted code will apply. A part need not be coded as noncompetitive based on
          an initial market survey which only uncovers one interested source. If the
          government has sufficient technical data in its possession to enable other sources
          to repair an acceptable part, and there are no technical restrictions on the part
          which would preclude other sources from repairing it, the part should be coded
          competitive.
             A9.2.6.4.5.7.1. RMSC A. The Government's right to use data in its
             possession is questionable. This code is only applicable to parts under
             immediate contract repair requirements and for as long thereafter as rights to
             data are still under review for resolution and appropriate coding. This code is
             assigned only until determination of the Government's rights to use data
             results in assignment of a different RMSC. If one source is available, RMCs 3,
             4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources exist, or if the data is adequate for an
             alternate source to qualify IAW the design control activity's procedures,
             RMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
             A9.2.6.4.5.7.2. RMSC B. This part must be repaired by a source(s) specified
             on a source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version
             of ASME Y14.100, Engineering Drawing and Related Documentation
             Practices. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing
             knowledge is not available to permit repair by other sources. Although, by
             ASME Y14.100 definition, altered and selected items shall have an adequate
             technical data package, data review discloses that required data or data rights
             are not in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained. If
             one source is available, RMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources exist,
             RMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
             A9.2.6.4.5.7.3. RMSC C. This part requires engineering source approval by
             the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing
             unique engineering skills, and repair knowledge by the qualified source(s)
             require repair of the part by the approved source(s). The approved source(s)
             retain repair knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available
             to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the
             quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify IAW the design control
             activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering
             activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government
             engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended
168                                                 AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


      application. If one source is approved, RMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least
      two sources are approved or if data is adequate for an alternate source to
      qualify IAW the design control activity's procedures, RMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
      A9.2.6.4.5.7.4. RMSC D. If the data needed to complete contract repair is not
      physically available, it cannot be obtained economically, nor is it possible to
      draft adequate specifications or any other adequate, economical description of
      the repair for a competitive solicitation. RMCS 3, 4, or 5 are valid.
      A9.2.6.4.5.7.5. RMSC E. (Reserved).
      A9.2.6.4.5.7.6. RMSC F. (Reserved).
      A9.2.6.4.5.7.7. RMSC G. The Government has rights to the technical data,
      the data package is complete, and there are no technical data, engineering,
      tooling or repair restrictions. This is the only RMSC that implies that parts are
      candidates for full and open competition. Other RMSCs such as K, M, N, Q,
      and S may imply limited competition when two or more independent sources
      exist yet the technical data package is inadequate for full and open
      competition. RMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
      A9.2.6.4.5.7.8. RMSC H. The Government physically does not have in its
      possession sufficient, accurate, or legible data to contract repair with other
      than the current source(s). This code is applicable only to parts under
      immediate repair requirements and only for as long thereafter as the
      deficiency is under review for resolution and appropriate recoding. This code
      is only assigned until resolution of the physical data questions result in
      assignment of a different RMSC. If one source is available, RMCs 3, 4, or 5
      are valid. If at least two sources exist, RMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
      A9.2.6.4.5.7.9. RMSC I. (Not authorized).
      A9.2.6.4.5.7.10. RMSC J. (Reserved).
      A9.2.6.4.5.7.11. RMSC K. This part must be produced from class 1 castings
      and similar type forgings as approved (controlled) by procedures contained in
      the current version of SAE-AMS2175, Castings, Classification and Inspection
      Of. If one source has such castings and cannot provide them to other sources,
      RMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources have such castings or they
      can be provided to other sources RMCs 1 or 2 or valid.
      A9.2.6.4.5.7.12. RMSC L. The annual repair budget value of this part falls
      below the screening threshold established by local policy. However, this part
      has been screened for additional known sources, resulting in either
      confirmation that the initial source exists or other sources may repair the part.
      No additional screening was performed to identify the competitive or
      noncompetitive conditions that would result in assignment of a different
      RMSC. This code shall not be used when screening parts entering the
      inventory. This code shall be used only to replace RMSC O for parts under the
      established screening threshold. If one source is available, RMCs 3, 4, or 5 are
      valid. If at least two sources exist, RMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                   169


             A9.2.6.4.5.7.13. RMSC M. Repair of this part requires use of master or
             coordinated tooling. If only one set of tooling exists and cannot be made
             available to another source for repair of this part, RMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid.
             When the availability of existent or refurbish-able tooling is available to two
             or more sources, then RMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
             A9.2.6.4.5.7.14. RMSC N. Repair of this part requires special test and/or
             inspection facilities to determine and maintain ultra-precision quality for its
             function or system integrity. Substantiation and inspection of the precision or
             quality cannot be accomplished without such specialized test or inspection
             facilities. If the test cannot be made available for the competitive repair of the
             part, the required test or inspection knowledge cannot be documented for
             reliable replication or the required physical test or inspection facilities and
             processes cannot be economically documented in a TDP, valid RMCs are 3, 4,
             or 5. If the facilities or tests can be made available to two or more competitive
             sources, RMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
             A9.2.6.4.5.7.15. RMSC O. The part was not assigned an RMSC when it
             entered the inventory, nor has it ever completed contract repair screening. Use
             of this code in conjunction with RMC 0 is sometimes necessary but
             discouraged. Maximum effort to determine the applicability of an alternate
             RMSC is the objective. Only RMC O is valid.
             A9.2.6.4.5.7.16. RMSC P. The rights to use the data needed for contract
             repair of this part from additional source(s) are not owned by the Government
             and cannot be purchased, developed, or otherwise obtained. It is
             uneconomical to reverse engineer this part. This code is used in situations
             where the Government has the data but does not own the rights to the data. If
             only one source has the rights or data to repair this item, RMCs 3, 4, or 5 are
             valid. If two or more sources have the rights or data to manufacture this item,
             RMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
             A9.2.6.4.5.7.17. RMSC Q. The Government does not have adequate data,
             lacks rights to data, or both needed to contract repair of this part from
             additional sources. The Government has been unable to economically buy the
             data or rights to the data. Breakout to competition has not been achieved, but
             current, continuing actions to obtain necessary rights to data or adequate,
             repair technical data indicate breakout to competition is expected to be
             achieved. This part may be a candidate for reverse engineering or other
             techniques to obtain technical data. If one source is available, RMCs 3, 4, or 5
             are valid. If at least two sources exist, RMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
             A9.2.6.4.5.7.18. RMSC R. The Government does not own the data or the
             rights to the data needed to contract repair of this part from additional sources.
             It has been determined to be uneconomical to buy the data or rights to the
             data. It is uneconomical to reverse engineer the part. This code is used when
             the Government did not initially purchase the data and/or rights. If only one
             source has the rights or data to repair this item, RMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If
             two or more sources have the rights or data to repair this item, RMCs 1 or 2
170                                                       AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009


            are valid.
            A9.2.6.4.5.7.19. RMSC S. Repair of this item is restricted to Government
            approved source(s) because the repair of this item involves unclassified but
            militarily sensitive technology (ref. FAR 6.3, Competition Requirements -
            Other than Full and Open Competition). If one source is approved, RMCs 3,
            4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources are approved, RMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
            A9.2.6.4.5.7.20. RMSC T. (Reserved).
            A9.2.6.4.5.7.21. RMSC U. The cost to the Government to breakout this part
            and repair it competitively has been determined to exceed the projected
            savings over the life span of the part. If one source is available, RMCs 3, 4, or
            5 are valid. If at least two sources exist, RMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
            A9.2.6.4.5.7.22. RMSC V. This part has been designated a high reliability
            part under a formal reliability program. Probability of failure would be
            unacceptable from the standpoint of safety of personnel and/or equipment.
            The cognizant engineering activity has determined that data to define and
            control reliability limits cannot be obtained nor is it possible to draft adequate
            specifications for this purpose. If one source is available, RMCs 3, 4, or 5 are
            valid. If at least two sources are available, RMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
            A9.2.6.4.5.7.23. RMSC W. (Reserved).
            A9.2.6.4.5.7.24. RMSC X. (Not authorized).
            A9.2.6.4.5.7.25. RMSC Y. The design of this part is unstable. Engineering,
            manufacturing, or performance characteristics indicate that the required
            design objectives have not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated
            because the part has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal
            performance during tests or service use. These changes will render the present
            part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration. Limited repair by the
            present source is anticipated pending configuration changes. If one source is
            available, RMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources exist, RMCs 1 or 2
            are valid.
            A9.2.6.4.5.7.26. RMSC Z. This part is a commercial/non-developmental/off-
            the-shelf item. Commercial item descriptions, commercial vendor catalog or
            price lists or commercial manuals assigned a technical manual number apply.
            If one source is available, RMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If at least two sources are
            available, RMCs 1 or 2 are valid.
      A9.2.6.4.6. RMC/RMSC Expiration Date Field (29). A RMC/RMSC expiration date
      must be entered in this field. If an RDL was prepared by the ES, the RDL will be
      reviewed prior to RMC/RMSC assignment. Expiration dates will be assigned IAW
      the following:
         A9.2.6.4.6.1. Every part whose breakout status can be improved shall be
         suspensed for re-screening as appropriate. In general, the following codes cannot
         be improved: R1G, R2G, R1K, R2K, R1M, R2M, R1N, R2N, R1T, R2T, R1Z, or
         R2Z. The period between suspenses, is a period for which an assigned
AFMCI21-149 4 MARCH 2009                                                                      171


            RMC/RMSC is considered active, and routine re-screening of parts with ―valid‖
            codes is not required. Suspense dates may vary with the circumstance surrounding
            each part. In exceptional cases, where circumstances indicate that no change can
            be expected in a code over an extended period, a suspense date not exceeding five
            years may be assigned IAW controls established by the breakout activity.
            Suspense dates for temporary codes A, Q, H shall not exceed 24 months.
         A9.2.6.4.7. Reason Field (30). If the RMC/RMSC is other than competitive,
         document the limiting factor(s) and actions taken to remove/remedy the limiting
         factor. If the repair is competitive but other than full and open, document justification
         as to why the contract is not full and open. When updating screening, add and date
         efforts to improve competitive status, but until repair is competitive do not delete
         historical efforts and status of those efforts.
         A9.2.6.4.8. Approved Sources/CAGE Code/Date Approved Fields (31). Enter the
         name/CAGE for sources of repair, date approved, and any restrictions. Annotate basis
         of the qualification and reason for any restrictions in Remarks Field.
         A9.2.6.4.9. Engineer Name Field/Code/Office Symbol/Phone/Completion Date (32).
         Self explanatory.
     A9.2.6.5. PART V. Remarks Field (33). Remarks for continuations, justifications,
     coordination and other information. Include functional responsibility, name, date, and
     Field number for each set of remarks. If QR or waiver does not apply, list the known
     responsible sources.
         A9.2.6.5.1. The Cognizant Engineer is responsible to review, edit, and validate the
         information on the RDL ―prior to sending completed form to the PMS.‖
         A9.2.6.5.2. The AFMC Form 762 and all associated documentation will be routed
         back to the PMS for inclusion in the PR package. The PMS will keep the completed
         package in the MR file.
  A9.2.7. Any pertinent historical data including previous repair sources, additional I&S
  NSNs, part numbers, vendors, engineering historical data should be documented in the MR is
  to be included in the Remarks Field (33), of the AFMC Form 762. Attach letter size bond
  paper with additional information, if more space is needed. Additional information should
  reference the applicable Field of the AFMC Form 762.

These procedures are to be used to record requisitions in CAV AF when reparable or consumable
Government Furnished Material (GFM) is processed for Credit Turn-in.

In lieu of creating requisitions directly in CAV via Web entry by either the contractor or respective ALC
CDM office, an 80 record position ―.txt‖ file containing modified MILSTIP images will be emailed to
HQ AFMC CAV AF office. These requisitions will then be batch-loaded into CAV AF. This process
obviates the requirement to provide same day notification to HQ AFMC CAV AF office and for these
requisitions to be intercepted before CAV AF transmits them to the supply system source of supply.

Example 2 is a sample file that shows the required file layout. It may also be used as a template. The
layout format is as follows:

EXAMPLE 1: Batch Requisitioning Reparable and Consumable GFM incident to
CDMAG Credit Turn-in Procedures

These procedures are to be used to record requisitions in CAV AF when reparable or consumable
Government Furnished Material (GFM) is processed for Credit Turn-in.

In lieu of creating requisitions directly in CAV via Web entry by either the contractor or respective ALC
CDM office, an 80 record position ―.txt‖ file containing modified MILSTIP images will be emailed to
HQ AFMC CAV AF office. These requisitions will then be batch-loaded into CAV AF. This process
obviates the requirement to provide same day notification to HQ AFMC CAV AF office and for these
requisitions to be intercepted before CAV AF transmits them to the supply system source of supply.
