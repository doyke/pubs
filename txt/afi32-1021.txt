                   MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT PLANNING

2.1. Planning. Effective planning establishes facility and infrastructure requirements critical for
mission accomplishment and proposes the most effective and economical means of satisfying
those requirements.
2.2. Planning Actions.
   2.2.1. Determine Requirements. Installations identify facility needs 3-5 years in the future
   and determine which needs cannot be met with existing facilities. Installation commanders
   review, validate, and prioritize installation MILCON facility requirements.
   MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs review and submit their programs as outlined in paragraph 3.3.5. .
   Requirements shall be based on AFMAN 32-1084, Facility Requirements, which provides
   typical requirements for a given facility type. Reference to other Air Force or DoD
   publications or a detailed study of unique user requirements may also be necessary to
   determine complete needs. The ANG and AFR have unique facility requirements that can be
   different from active duty installations. ANG unique facility requirements are published by
   NGB/A7. AFR unique facility requirements are contained in AFRCH 32-1001, “Standard
   Facility Requirements.
   2.2.2. Evaluate Alternative Solutions. Installations evaluate existing assets and determine
   the most economical and effective means of satisfying facility needs. (T-2). Consideration
   shall be made for consolidating requirements into existing or “right-sized” facilities to reduce
   the Air Force physical plant. New construction greater than $2M will require justification
   based on an economic analysis performed in accordance with AFI 65-501, Economic
   Analysis.
   2.2.3. Initiate Programming Actions. When it is determined that a facility must be
   constructed or upgraded, the BCE will initiate the construction programming process, and

                     MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMING

3.1. MILCON Programming. Programming is the process of developing and obtaining
approval and funding for MILCON projects. Installations and FOAs identify, develop, and
validate MILCON projects, and submit prioritized list of projects to their MAJCOM/FOA/DRU
representative. (T-2). MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs compile, validate, and submit MILCON programs
according to this AFI and instructions provided in annual HQ USAF MILCON program call
letters. In addition; NGB/A7A and AFRC/A7P compile, validate and submit their MILCON
programs according to AFI and instructions provided in annual HQ USAF MILCON program
call letter. (T-2) AF/A7CF presents the Total Force AF MILCON program to the Air Force
Corporate Structure and advocates for MILCON resources through the Air Force Corporate
Structure and OSD.
3.2. MILCON Definition. Military Construction, as defined in 10 U.S.C. § 2801, Scope of
Chapter, Definitions and § 2802, Military Construction Projects includes any construction,
development, conversion, or extension of any kind carried out with respect to a military
installation. MILCON includes construction projects for all types of buildings, roads, airfield
pavements, and utility systems. Military Construction project costing up to $750K is generally
planned and programmed using other appropriations in accordance with AFI 32 – 1032. The Air
Force MILCON program objective is to provide quality facilities to support Air Force missions.
A MILCON project includes all construction work necessary to produce a complete and usable
facility or a complete and usable improvement to an existing facility.
   3.2.1. Project Authority. Authority to carry out a MILCON project includes authority for
   surveys and site preparation; acquisition, conversion, rehabilitation, or installation of
   facilities; acquisition and installation of equipment and appurtenances integral to the project;
   acquisition and installation of supporting facilities (including utilities) and appurtenances
   incident to the project; and planning, supervision, administration, and overhead incident to
   the project.
   3.2.2. Project Limitations. OMB Circular A-11, Part 2, Section 31.5 mandates fully funded
   MILCON projects in the President’s Budget. Specifically, OMB Circular A-11 encourages
   phasing of large funded projects into complete and usable phases, with phases in multiple
   years, when feasible, in lieu of incrementing projects. Each phase must be complete and
   usable whether or not the following phases are constructed. For large funded (greater than
   $200M) projects where phasing is not feasible, OMB approval is required to increment
   projects appropriation over multiple years. Full Authorization of incrementally funding
   projects is required in the first year of the budget cycle and appropriations will be requested
   over multiple years.
3.3. MILCON Project Development. Project development is one of the most important
actions in MILCON programming and is documented using a DD Form 1391. The DD Form
1391, by itself, shall explain and justify the project to all levels of the Air Force, OSD, OMB,
and Congress. Justification data shall clearly describe the impact on mission, people,
productivity, life-cycle cost, etc., if the project is not accomplished. (T-1). BCEs will develop
the initial planning documents to support each MILCON project in accordance with AFI 32-

1023. . A project folder for each MILCON project must be established at Installation level and
all actions throughout the planning process must be recorded. In addition, each subsequent
change identified during the planning charrette and design process, including changes to the
project by OSD actions, must be filed. Changes to the DD Form 1391 from the initial planning
stages to President’s Budget (PB) submission must be tracked and filed for record in the project
folder at the installation.
   3.3.1. Project Identification. With the exception of HQ USAF-directed projects,
   installation commanders determine which facility needs cannot be met with existing
   facilities. Installation commanders review, validate, and prioritize installation MILCON
   facility requirements. (T-2). When it is determined a facility shall be constructed or
   upgraded, the BCE will prepare and submit a DD Form 1391, with all other applicable
   documentation, and enter the project into the CE electronic programming database. (T-1).
   Documentation (typically obtained from facility users/tenants) shall include a fully justified,
   indisputable case for accomplishing the project. (T-2). A project is considered initiated for
   programming once it is entered into the CE electronic programming database. New Mission
   MILCON requirements will be identified and advocated through the respective Core
   Function Lead (CFL) who serves as the principal integrator for their assigned Service Core
   Function (SCF). For ANG projects, the BCE submits DD Forms 1391/1390 to NGB/A7A.
   For AFRC projects BCE submit DD Forms 1391/1390 to HQ AFRC/DA7.
   3.3.2. Validation. HQ USAF, MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs, and installations shall validate each
   MILCON project by verifying the requirement that creates the need for the proposed project
   and confirming the proposed project is the most cost effective means of satisfying the
   requirement. All projects costing over $2 million, require an economic analysis in
   accordance with AFI 65-501. The MAJCOM/A7N or equivalent confirms by a signed letter
   that DD Form 1391 data is accurate and complete.
   3.3.3. Project Cost Estimates. Cost estimates must be closely scrutinized to ensure they are
   in-line with the OSD Pricing Guide or fully justified with historical cost data. (T-1).
   Installations and MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs should prepare cost estimates using parametric
   estimating tools. (T-2). The basis for parametric project cost estimates shall be completed
   planning documents, as defined by the USAF Project Managers Guide for Design and
   Construction. (T-2). Use the Tri-Service Parametric Cost Engineering System (PACES) as a
   tool to develop parametric cost estimates; however, PACES cost estimates for primary
   facilities shall be consistent with unit prices published in the OSD Pricing guide. (T-1).
   Major cost differences between PACES and the OSD Pricing Guide (e.g., clay tile roof
   versus standing seam metal roof) shall be fully justified in the project file. (T-2). Capture
   unique requirements of a project as separate line items under Primary or Supporting Facility
   cost. (T-1). The cost of Sustainable Design not to exceed 2% should be identified under
   Primary Facilities. (T-1). Project costs shall include contingency (typically 5%) and
   Supervision, Inspection, and Overhead (SIOH). (T-1). SIOH costs vary by location and are
   listed in Table 3.1. Coordinate with AFCEC to confirm the project design method, Design
   Build vs. Traditional. For Design Build projects, a 4% design cost should be included on the
   DD Form 1391. (T-1).

      3.3.3.1. Utility Connections. MILCON projects must capture the cost to connect to
      existing installation utility infrastructure to provide a complete and usable facility. (T-1).
      If existing utilities do not have enough capacity to carry the new loads generated by the
      project, include the cost to provide this capacity increase under Supporting Facilities.
      Major base-wide capacity increases will be programmed as a separate project.
          3.3.3.1.1. Privatized Utility Connections. This work should be a separate line item
          in Block 9 (Supporting Facilities), Cost Estimates, titled “Privatized Utility
          Connection Fee” and described in detail in Block 10, Description of Proposed
          Construction. The cost estimate must be shown as a lump sum requirement for each
          privatized utility connection and must not include quantities of materials or
          components. (T-1). Utility systems include (but are not limited to) piping, lift
          stations, transformers, valves, lines, conduit, overhead electrical poles, electrical
          vaults, water wells, water hydrants, sewer manholes, primary power electrical
          generators, waste water treatment and collection plants, etc.
   3.3.4. Design Schedules. AFCEC shall document design and construction schedules in
   Block 12 of the DD Form 1391 for each MILCON project. (T-1). The schedule shall show
   the design will be complete in time to award the construction in the fiscal year that funding is
   requested. (T-2). . Coordinate with AF/A7CF the project design schedule.
   3.3.5. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU MILCON Program Submittals. MAJCOM/DRUs shall
   prioritize validated projects and submit their commander or CFL-approved program in
   accordance with the annual MILCON program call letter issued by AF/A7CF .. Submittals
   should indicate which projects (if any) support specified Major Defense Acquisition
   Programs (MDAPS). SAF/AA shall prioritize validated projects and submit the HAF-
   represented FOA program to AF/A7CF. AFRC and ANG shall submit projects to their
   respective Joint Service Reserve Component Facility Board in accordance with instructions
   found in AFI 32-1012. . NGB/A7A and AF/RE shall submit their prioritized validated
   program to HQ AF/A7CF for total force consolidation and Air Force Corporate Structure
   review.
3.4. MILCON Program Development. AF/A7CF, in conjunction with other HQ USAF
functional offices, will review each MILCON project. In developing the MILCON program,
AF/A7CF consolidates projects from SAF/AA (representing FOAs), the MAJCOM/DRUs,
 20                                                          AFI32-1021 31 OCTOBER 2014


ANG, AFR, and Corporate Adjustments, and presents the proposed program to the Air Force
Corporate Structure for approval.
   3.4.1. Corporate Adjustments. Corporate Adjustments are projects approved and placed in
   the MILCON program by Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) or the Secretary of the Air
   Force (SECAF) due to their overriding importance to the Air Force. These projects are so
   necessary that they are considered must-pay bills and do not compete with other
   MAJCOM/FOA/DRU requirements.
3.5. MILCON and Program Objective Memorandum Schedules. The Air Force submits a
MILCON budget annually to OSD in the September time called BES.         OSD submits the
MILCON program to Congress thru OMB as part of the President's Budget (PB). Additionally,
each year, a five-year MILCON program or Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) is
developed. The FYDP outlines the MILCON projects proposed for the next five years.
Scheduling of these submittals is subject to change and is provided annually by the OSD
Comptroller.
   3.5.1. Office of the Secretary of Defense Budget Review. The Air Force submits the
   MILCON budget to OSD by facility category (such as operations and training facilities,
   maintenance and production facilities, research and development facilities, etc.). OSD
   reviews every project submitted and issues Resource Management Decisions (RMDs) that
   transmit their proposed decision on every project (approve, disapprove, revise, or defer to a
   future year). OSD provides reasons for their decisions. If the Air Force is not satisfied with
   these decisions and a strong case can be made to rebut the proposed decision, a reclama is
   developed and submitted by HAF. OSD review and consideration of these reclamas, along
   with senior level negotiations, determine the final RMD decision and ultimately the content
   and size of the MILCON program to be included in the President's Budget. After approval
   by OMB and the President, the budget is submitted to Congress.
   3.5.2. Congressional Review. The Secretary of Defense submits the MILCON portion (for
   all services and Defense-Wide Agencies) of the President's Budget to Congress in listings
   aggregated by country and state. The Secretary of Defense requests both authorization and
   appropriation for each MILCON project from Congress.
      3.5.2.1. Congressional Authorization. Authorization of MILCON projects is provided
      by the Defense Authorization Bill that includes authorization requests for other Defense
      accounts such as Procurement; Research, Development, Test and Evaluation; Operations
      and Maintenance; and Military Personnel. Normally, all projects that comprise the
      MILCON total obligation authority (TOA) are included in the authorization request.
      However, items authorized in a prior year for which only an appropriation is being
      requested are not included in the authorization request. They are included in the
      appropriation request only.
          3.5.2.1.1. Armed Services Committees. The House and Senate Armed Services
          Committees review the MILCON authorization request and hold hearings attended by
          witnesses from each service. These two committees then issue reports detailing their
          recommendations (referred to as committee marks). The full House and Senate then
          act on the committee’s recommendations and each passes its own version of the
          authorization program.
AFI32-1021 31 OCTOBER 2014                                                                   21


          3.5.2.1.2. Congressional Authorization Conference Actions. Differences between
          the House and Senate versions are resolved by an Armed Services Conference
          Committee which also issues a report that shows how the differences were resolved.
          Congress then passes the authorization program approved by the conference that
          becomes the authorization act. After the President signs the act, it becomes law
          (National Defense Authorization Act).
          3.5.2.1.3. Authorization Expirations. If no obligation is made for a project within
          three years after an authorization act becomes law, the authorization for that project
          will expire, unless an authorization extension is included in the authorization act
          passed at the end of the third year. AFCEC staffs shall submit requests for extensions
          to AF/A7CF describing the circumstances that prevented obligation. AF/A7CF
          validates the request and asks OSD, through SAF/IEE, to include requests for the
          extension in the authorization bill submitted to Congress. An authorization extension
          is requested for one year at a time for a maximum of two years. Authorization
          expires after five years and the project is cancelled. ANG submits authorization
          extensions and changes through AF/A7CF and NGB legislative Liaison.
          3.5.2.1.4. Other Matters Included in Authorization Request. The authorization
          request may include proposed changes to the existing United States Code that the
          Secretary of Defense submits for legislative consideration. MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs
          can propose legislative changes to AF/A7CF for consideration. The proposed
          changes will be reviewed by AF/A7C and staffed through SAF/IEE to OSD for
          consideration.
       3.5.2.2. Congressional Appropriation. The Secretary of Defense requests, for all
       services, appropriations for all items in the MILCON total obligation authority. The
       MILCON appropriation is a separate bill from all other DoD appropriations. The House
       and Senate Appropriations Committees follow the same procedure outlined for the
       Armed Services Committees in paragraph 3.5.2.1.1., in reviewing the appropriation
       request. After the President signs the bill, it becomes law (Military Construction and
       Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act). MILCON appropriations expire five years after
       they are appropriated. However, from time to time, general reductions and rescissions
       reduce funds available in prior years.
3.6. Advertising Construction Projects. AFCEC will not advertise Construction projects until
both the authorization and appropriation bills have been signed into law or given advance
authority to advertise from AF/A7CE based on Congressional committee Marks.
3.7. Project Files. Installations should maintain MILCON project files according to the Air
Force        Records          Disposition       Schedule    (RDS)          located       at
  22                                                           AFI32-1021 31 OCTOBER 2014

 3.8. Special Military Construction Authorities.
    3.8.1. Defense Medical MILCON.
         3.8.1.1. Authority. This program is managed by the Defense Health Agency (DHA) and
         is funded by the Defense Health Program, not Air Force TOA. This section applies to all
         active Air Force medical and medical related facilities; it does not apply to ANG or AFR
         medical or medical training facilities. The following directives apply: DoDI 6015.17,
         Planning and Acquisition of Military Health Facilities; and UFC 4-510-01, Design:
         Medical Military Facilities.
AFI32-1021 31 OCTOBER 2014                                                                   23


     3.8.1.2. Project Justification, Submittal, and Program Development. Reference UFC
     4-510-01, Chapter 2, Planning.
     3.8.1.3. Medical        Unspecified      Minor        Military        Construction
     Requirements. Installations and MAJCOMs shall process Medical Unspecified Minor
     Military Construction (UMMC) requirements in the same manner as medical MILCON
     projects. OASD (HA) funds approved projects from the Defense Health Program. (T-2).
     Projects programmed under the unspecified minor construction authority shall comply
     with DoDI 6015.17. (T-0). UMMC programming further is described in Chapter 4 of
     this Instruction.
     3.8.1.4. Medical Relocatable Facilities. Medical relocatable facilities are provided in
     accordance with guidance in Chapter 6 of this Instruction.
  3.8.2. Defense Access Road (DAR) Program.
     3.8.2.1. General. This program provides a means for DoD to contribute funding to
     improve public highways serving defense installations and activities. The program is
     authorized by Section 210 of Title 23, CFR, Part 660, Subpart E, Defense Access Roads,
     and implemented by Army Regulation 55-80, DoD Transportation Engineering
     Program. The DAR Program is managed by Military Surface Deployment and
     Distribution Command (SDDC), Department of the Army, and co-administered by the
     Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Department of Transportation. The FHWA is
     the link to State and local transportation agencies that normally execute the projects.
     3.8.2.2. DAR Project Justification and Submittal. The DoD expects state and local
     transportation agencies to develop and maintain public highways that serve permanent
     defense installations. Before requesting funds through the DAR program, an installation
     shall first request the jurisdictional authority to fund and accomplish the required
     improvements. (T-1). However, some defense-generated impact may be too sudden or
     unusual to be incorporated into normal civil highway improvement programs. Such
     impacts could include traffic increases due to major on-base facility expansions, addition
     of a new entrance gate, a requirement to move unique defense vehicles on low-volume
     roads, or realignment of public roads due to new facility development (e.g., runway
     extension). When it is understood that State and local authorities cannot or will not fund
     the necessary improvements, installations shall submit an Access Road Needs Report
     through their MAJCOM/DRU to AF/A7CF for requirement validation. (T-1).
     3.8.2.3. DAR Project Programming and Execution. Upon validation, AF/A7CF will
     coordinate the requirement with SDDC for eligibility determination and certification that
     the road is important to national defense. With AF/A7CF validation and SDDC
     certification, the MAJCOM/DRU shall include the project in the next command
     MILCON submittal, and clearly identify the requirement on the DD Form 1391 as a DAR
     project. Air Force funds are transferred to the FHWA via Standard Form 1151, Non-
     expenditure Transfer Authorization, to proceed with project design and construction.
  3.8.3. Energy Conservation Program. Title 10 U.S.C. §§ 2912 - 2913 allow the
  installation to share in savings from energy reductions. One-half of the savings remain at the
  installation to be used for maintenance and repair; minor alterations to existing military
  family housing units (with family housing energy savings); UMC projects that enhance
24                                                          AFI32-1021 31 OCTOBER 2014


  quality of life; or morale, welfare, or recreation (MWR) facilities/services that can be
  supported with appropriated funds. The other half of the savings is to be used for additional
  energy conservation measures. This portion is to be accumulated and managed by the
  MAJCOM/DRU. Refer to DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 12, Chapter 12 for further guidance.
     3.8.3.1. Normal MILCON. Energy projects may be MILCON-funded as outlined in
     paragraph 3.4 of this Instruction.
     3.8.3.2. Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP). ECIP is a special
     MILCON program centrally managed by OSD for all services. The program is submitted
     to Congress by OSD as a lump sum amount without base or project identification. The
     services compete for portions of the lump sum amount by submitting candidate projects
     with detailed justifications to OSD. The program is intended to provide projects that
     reduce energy consumption and utility costs. OSD reviews the projects, determines
     which are to be funded, and transfers funds to the service for project accomplishment.
     HQ USAF and the AFCEC issue annual guidance letters to MAJCOM/DRUs for
     implementing this program.
  3.8.4. Liquid Fuels Facilities. Liquid fuels facilities handling Defense Energy Support
  Center (DESC) owned products are the responsibility of the Defense Logistics Agency
  (DLA) for MILCON funding and advocacy. In response to the annual DLA program call
  CONUS MAJCOMs submit MILCON fuels projects to Air Force Petroleum Agency (AFPA)
  for prioritization and release to DLA. (T-1). AMC, AFCENT, USAFE, and PACAF submit
  their projects directly to their Combatant Commands (COCOM). (T-1). These COCOMs
  will submit the MILCON fuels projects to DLA, in accordance with DLAM 4270.1, DLA
  Facilities Projects Manual, and DoDM 4140.25, DoD Management of Bulk Petroleum
  Products, Natural Gas and Coal. Also, see AFI 23-201, Fuels Management and UFC 3-460-
  01, Petroleum Fuel Facilities, for additional guidance. Submit information copies to
  AF/A7CF.
     3.8.4.1. DLA fuels project data are not maintained in the CE electronic programming
     database. Word Document generated DD Forms 1391 shall be used for fuel projects.
     3.8.4.2. Bases or MAJCOMs shall contact AFPA to request DLA funds during the
     planning phase to develop the requirement, assess the site, and prepare DLA required
     project documents as needed.
     3.8.4.3. If a site survey, performed IAW paragraph 2.3.9, indicates presence of
     regulated substances (e.g. POL contamination) at the DLA project site, then a site
     mitigation plan shall be developed during advanced planning to identify how the
     regulated substances present on-site will be managed to minimize impact to the project.
  3.8.5. Land Acquisition. Land acquisition guidance is included in AFI 32-9001.
  3.8.6. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Security Investment Program
  (NSIP). Facilities and equipment required to support U.S. NATO-assigned forces and
  NATO operational plans shall be funded, to the maximum extent possible, through the NSIP
  in accordance with latest version of DoDD 2010.5. (T-0).
  3.8.7. DoD Education Activity (DoDEA). DoDEA is a field activity of the Office of the
  Secretary of Defense, operating under the authority of the Under Secretary of Defense for
AFI32-1021 31 OCTOBER 2014                                                                         25


   Personnel and Readiness in accordance with DoDD 1342.20, DoD Education Activity
   (DoDEA). DoDEA is responsible for all aspects of providing education programs to eligible
   DoD dependents, including facilities construction. DoDEA plans and programs its MILCON
   projects centrally.
3.9. Demolition Policy. Demolition funded as part of a MILCON project shall be directly
related to the project (e.g., in the footprint of the new construction or no longer needed as a result
of new construction). (T-1). Once a project is appropriated and authorized by Congress, the
demolition work identified on the DD Form 1391 must be completed. (T-1). Any exception to
this policy must be documented in a waiver approved by AF/A7C.
3.10. Emergency and Standby Power Authorization. The Air Force authorizes use of
emergency or standby diesel generators when needed to support mission-critical functions.
Refer to section 5 of AFI 32-1063, Electric Power Systems for type of facilities authorized for
emergency power. Authorized backup generators are paid by the MILCON appropriation and
should be included in the MILCON project, documented in Block 9 of the DD Form 1391 as a
separate line item under Supporting Facilities. However; Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
systems are not funded by the MILCON appropriation (3300) and should be funded by other

                                            Chapter 4

       UNSPECIFIED MINOR MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMING

4.1. Unspecified Minor Construction. Unspecified minor military construction (UMMC)
projects are authorized by 10 U.S.C. § 2805, Unspecified Minor Construction.
4.2. Minor Construction Project Funding. UMMC projects are MILCON projects having a
funded cost not to exceed $2,000,000 unless otherwise authorized by law. However, if the
UMMC project is intended solely to correct a life, health, or safety-threatening deficiency, the
funded cost can be up to $3,000,000. Any project solely intended to correct life, health, or safety
threatening deficiencies, regardless of estimated cost, should clearly state in Block 10 that the
project is intended to correct the documented deficiencies and the statutory threshold is
$3,000,000. O&M funded minor construction is covered in AFI 32-1032, Planning and
Programming Appropriated Fund Maintenance, Repair, and Construction Projects.
4.3. Associated Projects. Each UMMC project must provide a complete and usable facility or
improvements to an existing facility. (T-0). Splitting requirements to keep project costs below
the UMMC threshold is prohibited. (T-0). An UMMC project shall not be accomplished
concurrently with a MILCON project in the same facility. (T-1). An UMMC project may
precede a MILCON project for a new mission requirement when the UMMC will provide a
complete and usable facility to meet a specific need. An UMMC project may follow a complete
MILCON project when new mission requirements are identified. Repair work in the same
facility may be programmed as a separate project and executed with the UMMC project. The
programming documents for both projects shall be crossed-referenced and Congress shall be
notified of intent to proceed with an UMMC project and companion repair work.
4.4. Project Submittal Process. The following steps outline the UMMC process:
   4.4.1. AF/A7CF issues a call letter to the MAJCOM/DRU/FOAs, requesting a prioritized list
   of UMMC projects.
   4.4.2. MAJCOM/DRU/FOAs submit a prioritized list of UMMC projects for the execution
   year. (T-2).
   4.4.3. Once a project is submitted, AF/A7CF oversees the project screening, prioritization,
   approval and congressional notification. Projects not awarded will compete for the next
   year’s UMMC appropriation unless included in the President’s Budget. MAJCOM’s are
   responsible for working with installations to update, prioritize and resubmit projects to A7CF
   for consideration in the next FY’s UMMC program.
   4.4.4. AF/A7CFC issues design instructions for approved projects through the CE electronic
   programming database to AFCEC; AFCEC in turn issues a field directive to the
   design/construction agent to start design of the project.
   4.4.5. AF/A7CFC reviews the AFCEC request for authority to advertise and responds to
   their request accordingly based on an agent approved current working estimate.
   4.4.6. AF/A7CF will review funding availability and staff the project for SAF/IEE approval
   and congressional notification in accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 2805. When a decision is
   made to carry out an UMMC project, SAF/IEE must notify the appropriate congressional
AFI32-1021 31 OCTOBER 2014                                                                        27


   committees, in writing, of the decision, the justification for the project, and the estimated cost
   of the project. The project may then be carried out only after the end of the 21-day
   congressional notification period (14 days if submitted electronically).
       4.4.7. AFCEC sends AF/A7CF a request for authority to award and release of funds.
       AF/A7CF will issue authority to award and authorize funds be sent to the DoD agent.
       AFCEC will prepare a Form 378 and forward to SAF/FMBIC for dissemination of funds
       to the agent. (T-2).
       4.4.8. MAJCOM/DRU/FOAs may submit emergent UMMC projects to AF/A7CF at any
       time. An emergent requirement is any critical and unforeseen requirement eligible for
       UMMC funding that is identified after the approval of the IPL and require funding in the
       current FY. This provides a means of accomplishing a project not previously identified
       during the budget year. To enable notification, the installation/MAJCOM must provide a
       complete project approval request package as soon as possible.
4.5. Project Justification. MAJCOM/DRU/FOAs submit project requests under the UMMC
authority to AF/A7CF using a DD Form 1391/1391c. Requests shall identify any land
acquisition and .temporary facilities, indicate the date when the requirement was first known,
identify unit or activity relocation in submittal documents, provide the required completion date,
and schedule of related equipment delivery. (T-1). Identify any O&M funded work associated
with the total project scope and provide copies of the DD Form 1391 for any companion O&M
project and cross reference DD Forms 1391 to each other. (T-1). The MAJCOM/A7N shall sign
the following statement, included on the DD Form 1391, for all projects submitted to HQ USAF
for authority approval: “I have reviewed the DD Form 1391 and assure the document is complete
and accurate, and have validated the primary and supporting costs. The scope has been fully
coordinated with the user and the Base Civil Engineer.” In the submittal, include a Certificate of
Compliance for UMMC (Figure 4.1) signed by the host installation commander and endorsed by
the MAJCOM A7, or designated representative.
4.6. Project Execution. AFCEC will serve as the design/construction manager for Active
component projects; the design/construction agent will be determined in accordance with DoDD
4270.5, i.e., normally USACE, NAVFAC, or AFCEC (United Kingdom). If circumstances
warrant, an exception to policy can be requested for an alternate agent through AFCEC to the
appropriate DOD design/construction agent. (T-2).

         EMERGENCY, DAMAGED OR DESTROYED, AND CONTINGENCY
                      CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS

5.1. Purpose of Chapter. This chapter provides guidance for obtaining MILCON projects
under certain special program authorities. This chapter implements DoDD 4270.5, Military
Construction. Special programs include: 10 U.S.C. § 2803, Emergency Construction; 10 U.S.C.
§ 2854, Restoration or Replacement of Damaged or Destroyed Facilities; 10 U.S.C. § 2804,
Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Contingency Construction; and 10 U.S.C. § 2808, Construction
Authority in Event of Declaration of War or National Emergency.
5.2. Special Construction Programs.
   5.2.1. Emergency Construction (10 U. S.C. § 2803). This provision is used for projects
   vital to national security or for the protection of health, safety, or the quality of the
   environment, so urgent they cannot be deferred to the next MILCON submittal.
      5.2.1.1. Project Justification and Submittal. MAJCOM/DRUs submit project
      justifications to AF/A7CF. The submittal shall include a DD Form 1391, and a DD Form
      1391c, and any additional info requested by AF/A7CF. (T-1). The Air National Guard
      follows similar processes but will submit emergency construction requests directly to
      SAF/IEE and coordinate with AF/A7CF. The urgency of the project shall be explained,
      including the date the emergency arose and why it was not known in time for inclusion in
      the MILCON budget currently before Congress. (T-1). The submittal shall also explain
      the impact on the installation mission if the urgent requirement is deferred until the next
      MILCON budget submission. (T-1).
      5.2.1.2. Funding. Emergency construction projects are funded from unobligated
      balances made available from authorized and appropriated MILCON programs. AFCEC
      and AF/A7CF will identify and use the oldest savings and cancellations from prior
      MILCON projects. (T-2). Air National Guard will identify and use the oldest available
      unobligated MILCON dollars for its emergency construction projects.
      5.2.1.3. Approvals Required. AF/A7CF validates the requirement and submits projects
      to SAF/IEE for approval and notification to the appropriate Congressional authorization
      committees. Subsequently, AF/A7CF, through SAF/FMB, requests the OSD Comptroller
      seeks approval from the Senate and House Appropriations Committees to reprogram the
      identified offsets to the emergency project. A project may be carried out only if: (1) no
      objection is raised by the Armed Services Committees and (2) approval from the
      Appropriations Committees is obtained for reprogramming funds. Emergency projects
      shall be accomplished within approved funds. The maximum that can be obligated by the
      Air Force under 10 U.S.C. § 2803 in any fiscal year is $50 million.
   5.2.2. Restoration or Replacement of Damaged or Destroyed Facilities (10 U. S.C. §
   2854). This authority is used for facilities damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, wind,
   crashes, explosions, tornadoes, hurricanes, volcanoes, earthquakes, typhoons, etc. 10 U.S.C.
   § 2854 provides authorization only (no appropriations). There is no annual dollar limit.
30                                                           AFI32-1021 31 OCTOBER 2014


  ANG will follow similar procedures for project approval and reprogramming, but work
  directly with SAF/IEE and SAF/FMB and coordinate with AF/A7CF.
     5.2.2.1. Criteria for Projects. The destroyed or damaged facility shall have been in use
     or planned for use at the time of the damage or destruction. (T-1). Restoration or
     replacement shall not provide larger facilities than those damaged or destroyed, except
     that MAJCOM/DRUs may provide for limited increases as a result of economy of design
     or compliance with new criteria. (T-1). MAJCOM/DRUs cannot use these projects to
     correct space deficiencies.
     5.2.2.2. Operations and Maintenance Funds for Clean Up. MAJCOM/DRUs may
     clean up the damage and minimally restore the facility with Operations and Maintenance
     funds, provided construction class work does not exceed $750,000. MILCON funds, if
     subsequently approved for restoration or replacement of the facility, will not reimburse
     Operations and Maintenance accounts.
     5.2.2.3. Project Justification and Submittal. The submittal process for
     MAJCOM/DRUs is the same as for emergency projects (refer to paragraph 5.2.1.1). In
     addition, the submittal shall explain the urgency and indicate, for each facility, the cause
     of damage or destruction. (T-1). Include the building number, name, value before
     damage or destruction, size, and construction type. (T-1). MAJCOM/DRUs shall certify
     the project is for restoration or replacement of facilities damaged or destroyed, and any
     scope increase is a result of economy of design or compliance with new criteria.
     5.2.2.4. Funding. Project funding is accomplished under the same procedures as
     emergency construction projects (refer to paragraph 5.2.1.2).
  5.2.3. Secretary of Defense Contingency Construction. (10 U.S.C. § 2804) Use of this
  authority is rare. Projects must be considered for funding under authorities available to the
  Secretary of the Air Force before being considered for funding under the authority of the
  Secretary of Defense.
     5.2.3.1. Project Justification. The Air Force shall first consider using its Emergency
     Construction Authority (10 U.S.C. § 2803) and provide reasons to the Secretary of
     Defense why that authority cannot be used. Use of Contingency Construction Authority
     does not require identification of funding from project cancellations or savings since
     limited appropriations are provided to the Secretary of Defense for this authority.
     5.2.3.2. Project Submittal. MAJCOM/DRUs shall submit requests according to DoDD
     4270.5. (T-2). Requests should include the same information as required in paragraph
     5.2.1.1 In addition, requests shall include Unified and Specified Commander's
     certification the project is vital to US Security. Factors making the project vital to the
     security of the United States shall be described in detail. Reasons the project cannot be
     programmed in accordance with established planning, programming, and budgeting
     system procedures, or accomplished using Air Force emergency construction authority
     shall be listed. Also, provide anticipated contract award and design completion dates.
  5.2.4. Construction Authority in the Event of Declaration of War or National
  Emergency. (10 U.S.C. § 2808) The Secretary of Defense may authorize the services to
  undertake military construction projects not otherwise authorized by law. The Air Force may
AFI32-1021 31 OCTOBER 2014                                                              31


  undertake these projects only within the amount of funds appropriated. The Secretary of
  Defense will provide guidance at the time this authority is needed.
  5.2.5. Emergency Compliance with the EIAP. Emergency situations do not exempt the
  Air Force from complying with NEPA, prior to commitment of resources. In some
  situations, limited emergency response may take place while completing the EIAP (refer to
  32 CFR Part 989.34(b) and 40 CFR Part 1506.11).

                                            Chapter 6

                       RELOCATABLE (TEMPORARY) FACILITIES

6.1. Relocatable (Temporary) Use Facilities Background. Current DoD and AF policy is to
keep temporary facilities to an absolute minimum; as short-term as possible (less than five
years); and only in use until the permanent facility is built or the mission no longer requires their
use. These facilities must be functional yet austere. There shall be no appearance of
permanence, such as brick exteriors, brick building signs, or extensive landscaping. (T-2). This
chapter provides guidance on satisfying both interim (paragraph 6.2) and incident (paragraph
6.3) facility requirements using relocatable or temporary facilities.
   6.1.1. Definition. A relocatable building is a structure that is designed and constructed to be
   readily moved, erected, disassembled, stored, and reused, and in the context of this
   Instruction, must be fulfilling a temporary requirement. Also included in the definition are
   tension fabric structures assembled from modular components and air supported domes, both
   of which can be easily disassembled, moved, and reused. For the purpose of this Instruction,
   the definition excludes mobile military equipment such as communications vans, emergency
   management and command post trailers. Also excluded are tents, modular sheds less than
   500 square feet, temporary contractor trailers, and temporary government construction
   administration trailers that are located on or in the vicinity of a construction site.
       6.1.1.1. For guidance on aircraft sunshades, refer to AFI 21-136, Aircraft Sunshade
       Management.
6.2. Interim Facilities. Interim facilities are short-term requirements, normally 5 years or less,
resulting from transitory or peak military missions, deployments, contingency operations,
disaster relief operations, or urgent requirements pending approval and construction of
permanent facilities through the normal MILCON process. DoDI 4165.56, Relocatable
Buildings authorizes the purchase or lease of relocatable buildings to meet interim facility
requirements. It provides the authority to acquire, store, and use relocatable facilities when they
are the most feasible and economical means of satisfying interim facility requirements.
   6.2.1. Approval Authority. SAF/IEE delegated authority to The Civil Engineer, AF/A7C,
   to approve the use of relocatable facilities needed longer than five years. AF/A7C further
   delegated this authority to the MAJCOM/Senior Civil Engineer (including AFRC/A7 and
   NGB/A7). This authority may not be further delegated.
   6.2.2. Program Management. To improve visibility of peak and short-term facility
   management, all MAJCOM/DRUs and ANG shall submit a comprehensive list of short-term
   facilities highlighting those approved for longer than five years or which have been on the
   installation less than five years, but were granted an extension to exceed five years. (T-0).
   Submittal is required annually in response to the annual AF/A7CF call letter. The program
   management procedures outlined in this AFI apply to all relocatable facilities purchased or
   leased as equipment.
       6.2.2.1. Approval for Relocatable Facilities Interim to MILCON. The requiring
       MAJCOM/DRU shall identify the permanent MILCON or UMMC project for which the
       relocatable facility is interim. The MILCON project shall be identified in the next
       available MILCON budget submittal to AF/A7CF
AFI32-1021 31 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    33


     6.2.2.2. Approval of Relocatable Facilities for Peak or Transitory
     Purposes. Installations shall submit requests for use of relocatable buildings for peak or
     transitory purposes to MAJCOM/DRUs. (T-1). The MAJCOM/DRU validates the
     requirement, and if warranted, the MAJCOM/A7 approves the purchase or lease. The
     Command shall identify the mission for which the relocatable facility is required.
     6.2.2.3. Approval of Relocatable Facilities for Contingency Environments. Refer to
     guidelines provided in AFI 32-1032, Chapter 7, Facilities for Operational Requirements.
  6.2.3. Acquisition of Relocatable Facilities. Installations shall submit a DD Form 1391 to
  the MAJCOM/DRU or ANG for acquisition of a relocatable facility showing all costs
  (funded and unfunded) associated with the purchase or lease, with a separate entry for the
  construction support costs. (T-1). An economic analysis (refer to paragraph 6.2.3.3) shall
  be included in the submittal. (T-1).
     6.2.3.1. Funded Costs (Non-Recoverable Costs). If funded costs exceed the minor
     construction threshold, as stated in 10 U.S.C. § 2805, for either purchased or leased
     relocatable facilities they must be funded from the military construction appropriation
     (MCA). (T-0). These costs cannot be included in a lease; they shall be funded as a
     construction project (Minor Construction if costs are under the threshold). (T-1).
     Funded (Non-recoverable) facility components include, but are not limited to;
     foundations, concrete mounting slabs, site preparation, utility connections, stairways,
     porches or breezeways between units, extra wall covering and paneling, ceramic works,
     lighting, and other interior and exterior finishes and features not included in the original
     facility package or unit. In accordance with DoDI 4165.56. Enclosure 3, section c.,
     relocatable buildings may be authorized and acquired as real property. Acquisition of a
     relocatable facility as real property requires SAF/IEE approval (see paragraph 6.2.4). If
     acquired as real property, the relocatable building is a funded cost.
     6.2.3.2. Unfunded Costs (Acquisition Costs). When a relocatable facility is interim to
     a construction project or is deemed not necessary to provide a complete and usable
     construction project, it is an equipment item and is an unfunded cost associated with the
     project. Unfunded costs include relocatable facility acquisition, leasing, delivery to the
     site, erection, assembly, disassembly, packaging, transporting, maintenance, operation,
     and refurbishment. Relocatable facilities are purchased as equipment items using
     Operation and Maintenance funds (3400) if the cost is less than the expense investment
     threshold (currently $250,000). If the equipment costs exceed the expense investment
     threshold, use Other Procurement funds (3080) when appropriate.                 Research,
     Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) funds (3600) may be used to procure
     relocatable facilities. When relocatable facilities are leased, installations and
     MAJCOM/DRUs (T-2), will lease them as equipment with Operations and Maintenance
     funds (3400) (3830 and 3730 for ANG and AFRC, respectively) or RDT&E funds
     (3600).
     6.2.3.3. Economic Analysis Requirement. Installations shall prepare an economic
     analysis to support acquisition of relocatable facilities according to the guidelines in AFI
     65-501. (T-1). Prior to exercising annual options to continue leasing interim facilities,
     the economic analysis shall be updated and revalidated. (T-1).
 34                                                           AFI32-1021 31 OCTOBER 2014


       6.2.3.4. Engineering Evaluation Requirement. An engineering evaluation shall be
       performed to ensure the relocatable facility meets fire and safety requirements,
       antiterrorism requirements, and all construction standards established by the Air Force.
       (T-2). Reloctable facilities shall use sustainable design and energy efficient operating
       practices when time, material, and funds permit.
   6.2.4. Conversion to Real Property. Conversion of a purchased or leased relocatable
   building to Air Force real property requires SAF/IEE approval. (T-1).
       6.2.4.1. Conversion of Purchased Relocatable Facilities Where Funded and
       Unfunded Costs Exceed $750,000. MAJCOM/DRUs shall submit a DD Form 1391 to
       AF/A7CF describing the project and showing all costs. (T-1). AF/A7CF will request
       SAF/IEE approval. Upon approval SAF/IEE will notify the House and Senate Armed
       Services and Appropriations Committees of the AFs intent to convert the facility. If no
       Committee raises an objection within 21 days after notification (14 days if filed
       electronically), the notification process is complete, and AF/A7CF will advise the
       MAJCOM/DRU to proceed with the project. AF/A7CF will resolve any objection, if
       raised, prior to proceeding. ANG installations will submit documentation described above
       to NGB/A7 for processing to SAF/IEE.
       6.2.4.2. Conversion of Purchased Relocatable Facilities Where Funded and
       Unfunded Cost is Less than $750,000. MAJCOM/DRU staffs shall submit detailed
       justifications, including data on funded and unfunded costs, to AF/A7CF for conversion
       approval. (T-1). AF/A7CF will notify commands of approval or disapproval. ANG
       installations will submit documentation described above to NGB/A7 for approval.
       6.2.4.3. Conversion of Leased Relocatable Facilities. This type of conversion involves
       complex fiscal and legal procedures and should rarely arise. MAJCOM/DRU staffs shall
       submit requests for such conversions to AF/A7CF for appropriate processing. (T-1).
   6.2.5. Maintenance of Relocatable Facilities. When leased, the lease can stipulate that the
   lessor provides maintenance. The using organization is responsible for funding the
   maintenance cost of their relocatable facilities. The BCE is responsible for funding the
   maintenance cost of the real property associated with the relocatable (e.g., the foundations,
   site preparation, and utility connections). (T-2)
   6.2.6. Inventory, Reuse and Disposition of Relocatable Facilities. Purchased relocatable
   facilities classified as equipment are inventoried and accounted for with an item unique
   identification (IUID). MAJCOM/DRUs and ANG shall keep an accurate and current
   inventory of purchased, stored, and inactivated relocatable facilities. (T-1). Installations
   shall determine if a suitable relocatable asset is available through the MAJCOM/DRU before
   purchasing any new relocatable building. (T-2).
6.3. Temporary Facilities Incident to MILCON. These are short-term facilities required by
an Organization while waiting for a MILCON project. Facilities shall be of non-permanent
construction and removed when the MILCON project is completed and the permanent facility
occupied. (T-2). Relocatable facilities can be used to satisfy these temporary requirements as an
unfunded cost to the project. The cost of support to temporary facilities (foundations, site
preparation, and utilities) is a funded cost and shall be included as a supporting facility on the
DD Form 1391 for the MILCON project. The DD Form 1391 must also indicate that temporary
AFI32-1021 31 OCTOBER 2014                                                                         35


facilities are in use in the Current Situation paragraph. (T-1). If leased, the full cost of the lease
shall be included on the DD Form 1391 as an unfunded cost. (T-1). The lease cost will reflect
the period when the facility being constructed will not be available. Temporary facility costs
shall be included in the project life cycle cost analysis used to validate the construction project.
(T-1).

Terms
Equipment—All items of installed capital equipment.
Finding of No Practicable Alternative (FONPA)—A finding contained in a Finding of No
Significant Impact (FONSI) or Record of Decision (ROD) indicating that the Air Force has
evaluated practicable alternatives to siting in a floodplain or a wetland and that there is no other
practicable alternative to taking the action in the floodplain or wetland. This finding is based on a
rigorous analysis contained in the supporting EA or EIS.
Funded and Unfunded Costs— Definitions of funded and unfunded costs are as follows:
Funded Project Costs—Costs incurred during the construction phases are funded costs and are
funded from MILCON appropriations or O&M funded minor construction accounts. Funded
costs include, but are not limited to, the following:
Materials—All materials, supplies, and services applicable to the project.
Transportation—Transportation costs applicable to materials, supplies, installed capital type
equipment, and government-owned equipment.
Labor—All civilian labor costs including labor costs of construction units composed of foreign
nationals. These funded civilian labor costs for a project are determined by the accounting
system in the CE electronic database that uses the appropriate shop rate in its calculation.
Installation staffs shall not use any method other than the accounting procedures in the CE
electronic database to compute civilian labor funded costs. Otherwise, incomplete project costs
and subsequent non-compliance with minor construction funding limits might occur.
Overhead—That portion of installation overhead or support costs that can be identified as
representing additional costs incurred as a result of the project.
Supervision, Inspection and Overhead—The costs charged by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, and the Air Force when serving as the
design and/or construction agent.
 44                                                          AFI32-1021 31 OCTOBER 2014


Travel—All travel and per diem costs.
Equipment Operation—That portion of costs applicable to the operation and maintenance of
government-owned equipment. Such costs shall be computed on an hourly rate (shown in AFI
65-601V1).
Supported Component—Components identified in BRAC 2005 as transferring installation
management functions to another Component at a Joint Base.
Supporting Component—The Component identified in BRAC 2005 as having installation
management functions transferred to them from one or more supported Components and is now
responsible for providing Installation Support for the entire Joint Base.
Unfunded Costs—Some efforts in support of military construction are identified as unfunded
costs. Unfunded costs are those that (a) are part of the construction effort associated with a
military construction or O&M funded minor construction project, (b) are financed from
appropriations other than MILCON or O&M funded minor construction, and (c) are not
reimbursed by appropriations available for MILCON. For further information refer to DoD FMR
7000.14R, Volume 3, Chapter 17. Unfunded costs are capitalized as part of the real property
investment and include the following:
Military Labor—Military labor costs used for a project are unfunded. These unfunded military
labor costs are determined by the accounting system in the CE electronic database that uses the
shop rate in its calculation. Installation staffs shall not use any method other than the CE
electronic database accounting procedure to compute these unfunded military labor costs.
Otherwise, incomplete project costs and subsequent noncompliance with minor construction
funding limits might occur.
RED HORSE and Prime BEEF Units—The labor costs of RED HORSE and Prime BEEF
units are unfunded. These are costs for all labor performed by these units on a project. These
costs are computed directly from the labor performed and use of the shop rate is not applicable.
Depreciation—Costs applicable to the depreciation of government-owned equipment in
accordance with hourly rates determined in Chapter 26 of DoD Manual 7220.9-M, "Asset Use
Charge."
Materials—Materials, supplies, and items of installed capital equipment obtained specifically
for a project on a non-reimbursable basis, either as excess distributions from another Military
Department of Defense Agency or as excess distributions from other Government agencies. A
military Department of Defense Agency is precluded from using materials, supplies, or items of
installed capital type equipment on its own minor construction projects on a non-reimbursable
basis.
Fringe Benefits—Unfunded civilian fringe benefit rates as prescribed in Chapter 9 of AFI 65-
601, Volume I, for DoD civilian personnel.
Gifts—Gifts from private parties.
