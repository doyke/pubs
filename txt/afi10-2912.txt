                                             Chapter 1

                       THE AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION MISSION

1.1. Mission Overview. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) is one of AMC’s four primary
responsibilities as described in AFDD 3-17, Air Mobility Operations. Worldwide AE provides
expedient evacuation of patients to save life, limb, and eyesight, prevent undue suffering, and
preserve military strength. AE has proven to be a critical capability supporting Overseas
Contingency Operations, enabling the mobility airlift system to move casualties with improved
effectiveness and efficiency, rapidly delivering access to higher-level medical care. In addition,
this capability is being fully integrated into plans supporting homeland defense, humanitarian
assistance, disaster response, and Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) requirements, as
directed by the National Command Authority. The Operations (AF/A3) community partners
with the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) to provide AE capability for contingency and
peacetime inter/intra-theater operations.
     1.1.1. Capabilities. AE provides time sensitive enroute care of regulated casualties to and
     between medical treatment facilities, using USAF organic and/or contracted fixed-wing
     mobility aircraft with medical aircrew trained explicitly for this mission. AE forces can
     operate as far forward as fixed-wing aircraft are able to conduct air operations, across the full
     range of military operations, and in all operating environments. Critical Care Air Transport
     Teams (CCATTs) may be assigned to work with AE aircrew to support patients requiring
     more intensive en route care.
1.2. Readiness Training. AE personnel require highly specialized initial, sustainment, and
theater-specific training to respond to a variety of missions and environments. A continual
assessment and evaluation process ensures this training remains relevant and effective.
     1.2.1. Current Training System. Training is provided for individuals, teams (collective
     training), and leaders and prepares personnel to integrate themselves into joint platforms and
     operations. These training platforms include formal courses for deployment and clinical
     currency, local courses, briefings, and exercises.
1.3. Readiness Resourcing. To maintain a robust aeromedical evacuation readiness capability,
the A3 partners with the AFMS to manage the funding for training, exercises, personnel and
equipment through an internal planning, programming and budgeting system. Specifically, the
Medical Readiness (MR) Panel ensures resources are provided to create and maintain global
readiness initiatives. The Readiness Training and Oversight Committee (RTOC) and Medical
Readiness Decision Support System (MRDSS) Configuration Control Board (CCB) serve as sub-
panels to the MR panel.
     1.3.1. Lead Command. AMC is the Lead Command for AE. AFRC, ANG, PACAF, and
     USAFE receive AE guidance and support from AMC. PACAF and USAFE maintain
     responsibility for theater-unique capabilities. Within HQ AMC, the SG serves as the
     Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) Responsible Agency (MRA) for all
     AE UTCs. Pilot units work closely with the MRA to construct UTCs, associated mission
     capability statements (MISCAPs), and manpower details. The Program Element Monitor
     (PEM)/ Functional Area Manager (FAM) requests funding for the modernization and

   sustainment of UTCs through both Line of the Air Force (LAF) and medical programming
   channels.
1.4. Readiness Reporting. Realistic, comprehensive plans that describe responsibilities and
procedures to perform the unit’s mission are critical in building and maintaining highly effective
AE response. Reporting systems, such as Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS),
Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS), Enhanced Status of Resources and Training
System (ESORTS), and AEF Reporting Tool (ART) provide planners at Combatant Commands,
MAJCOMs, and the Air Staff valuable data with which to make planning and resourcing
decisions relevant to the myriad of Air Force taskings. Unit planning and readiness reports for
AE operations are discussed in Chapter 3 in this AFI.
1.5. AEF Tempo Band Construct. All AC Aeromedical Evacuation UTCs are postured as
enablers under the Air Mobility Operations Enabler-Global Reach Laydown (E-GRL), are not
aligned into a TEMPO BAND, and therefore must be prepared to deploy at all times.
AFRC/ANG UTCs are postured under the TEMPO BAND construct. AFRC trains as enablers to
be prepared to deploy outside their TEMPO BAND. ANG trains according to the TEMPO
BAND construct. For additional information, reference AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations
Planning and Execution, and guidance issued by Headquarters Air Force (HAF) FAM.

   2.10.2. Provide readiness input to the squadron training plan.
   2.10.3. Coordinate and schedule unit personnel to attend formal UTC training courses.
   2.10.4. Ensure readiness training is properly documented in MRDSS-ULTRA.
   2.10.5. Conduct all operational readiness reporting IAW AFI 10-201, AFI 10-244, and AFI
   10-206, Operational Reporting.
   2.10.6. Monitor the status of WRM, if assigned, through MRDSS-ULTRA, based upon input
   provided by medical logistics staff. Ensure medical logistics briefs the unit commander and
   the EMC.
   2.10.7. Identify unit readiness program resource requirements for budget submission.
   2.10.8. Integrate readiness portions of the AFIA AE Health Services Inspection (HSI) Guide
   into the unit self-inspection program. Brief the EMC on self-inspection results as appropriate.
   2.10.9. Ensure all readiness related appointment letters are current, updated, and maintained
   as required.
   2.10.10. Work with the EET Chief to design exercises that meet annual objectives.
   2.10.11. Ensure the EMC minutes document and track unit level exercise discrepancies to
   resolution IAW Wing direction.
2.11. Training Flight Commander. The Training Flight is responsible for the aircrew and
ground UTC specific training requirements of all assigned personnel. The training flight
commander will:
   2.11.1. Conduct, document, and track UTC specific training requirements. The training
   flight will ensure UTC Team Chiefs, assisted by training flight staff and subject matter
   experts, conduct UTC training sessions. UTC training for mission ready individuals will be
   completed within 120 days of UTC assignment. Training Flight personnel will work with
   UTC Team Chiefs to establish mechanisms to identify mission ready individuals who require
   make-up training, including newly assigned members who have missed previous training
   events, and ensure make-up training is conducted within 120 days. Effective management of
   the UTC specific training program requires close collaboration between the training flight
   and readiness staffs. This cooperation includes taking the necessary actions to ensure
   completion of UTC specific training events is annotated in required reporting systems.
   2.11.2. For units that possess WRM UTC equipment assemblages, ensure equipment sets are
   operationally tested on an annual basis. WRM assemblages should be fully set-up with
   equipment turned on, validating that all necessary pieces are available and in working
   condition. Following completion of training event, assemblage must be re-packed for future
   operational use. ART/SORTS should be updated to reflect assemblage is off-line. When the
   base is host to ARC or other Active Duty AE units with similar UTCs, the unit will ensure
   the tenant or supporting units are given the opportunity to train with the host unit’s UTCs;
   however those units have ultimate responsibility for operationally testing their own
   equipment. Refer questions to the MRA through owning MAJCOM. See AFI 41-209,
   Chapter 13, for WRM assemblage access.
   2.11.3. Host Medical/Aeromedical units that maintain WRM assemblages for AE units will
   provide opportunities for those units to train, exercise with, and/or operationally test the

   equipment annually. However, the host unit is not responsible for ensuring the training and
   exercising of WRM material is accomplished. When AE units train, exercise, or inventory
   assigned WRM, comments concerning the event, including current status, should be included
   in the EMC minutes.
   2.11.4. The operational In-Flight kit is the primary resource AES units use when deployed to
   support exercises and CONUS based deployments. WRM assets may be requested through
   appropriate channels for extenuating circumstances. WRM AE kits will be deployed from
   centralized storage locations to support all OCONUS contingencies when tasked. Each
   organization will provide adequate storage and management attention to ensure operational
   kits are maintained in a ―ready‖ state.

4.1. Training Philosophy. All AE personnel must be fully trained to meet the task
requirements associated with wartime, homeland defense, humanitarian assistance, and DSCA
operations.
4.2. Training Requirements. Specific training requirements for all AF personnel are contained
in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program. Unit UDM and UTM must be fully aware of
requirements contained in AFI 36-2201 to ensure compliance. In addition, personnel
maintaining flight qualification must ensure compliance/currency with AFI 11-2AE series
publications. Upon notification of deployment, personnel will complete further training required
by line remarks and reporting instructions. Personnel will accomplish additional training
outlined in attachment 2 of this AFI.
   4.2.1. Manage        AFSC      program    IAW        AFMS        Knowledge       Exchange
   https://kx.afms.mil/kxweb/dotmil/kj.do?functionalArea=RSVP. Only applicable to
   medical AFSCs. Personnel assigned to a standard UTC must complete the RSVP training for
   their Control AFSC (CAFSC) for enlisted and Duty AFSC (DAFSC) for officers. In
   addition, personnel who are utilized as authorized substitutes on a standard UTC must
   complete RSVP training for the AFSC they are filling to meet their role on the UTC, as well
   as their control or duty AFSC.
   4.2.2. Aeromedical Evacuation Contingency Operations Training (AECOT): For initial
   training on the integration of all AE UTC capabilities comprising the Theater Aeromedical
   Evacuation System (TAES), all personnel assigned to an AES will complete AECOT.
   Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members (AECMs) will complete AECOT within 12 months
   of aircrew qualification. AC non-AECM personnel will complete AECOT within 12 months
   of assignment. Newly accessed ARC non-AECM personnel will complete AECOT within 18
   months of completion of Basic Military Training or Commissioned Officer Training and
   AFSC formal course training. To sustain currency and proficiency of TAES operations, all
   personnel assigned to an AES will repeat AECOT every 60 months at a minimum.
   Participation in Lead Command and owning MAJCOM approved exercises, phase II
   Operational Readiness Exercises/Inspections (OREs/ORIs) where TAES is implemented, or
   participation in a deployment supporting ground AE operations in the last 60 months may
   satisfy the sustainment training requirement. Parent MAJCOMs are granted waiver authority
   and will copy all requests for sustainment training credit to HQ AMC/A3OE. As lead
   command, HQ AMC/A3OE has overall authority for all AE squadron waiver requests, and
   documentation will be kept on file at the unit for duration of waiver exemption.
   4.2.3. UTC Training: Training for each UTC will consist of review of Air Force Tactics,
   Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP) for AE, METLs, Mission Capability, Manpower and
   Logistics Force Package, Concept of Operations, AMC Concept of Employment, and
   associated equipment UTC. Training will include applicability/utilization in exercise,
   contingency, homeland defense, humanitarian assistance, and DSCA operations. This
   training is required prior to the member’s initial deployment as part of the UTC, with
   frequency as directed by the unit training plan.

   4.2.4. AE Field Training: Personnel assigned to AESs are highly encouraged to participate in
   MAJCOM approved [i.e. Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC), GLOBAL MEDIC, and
   PATRIOT] exercises to the greatest extent possible.
   4.2.5. DSCA Training: Due to the increased support of DSCA operations AE personnel will
   be familiar with Department of Defense (DoD) DSCA guidance, AMC planning factors, the
   National Incident Management System (NIMS), and the Air Force Incident Management
   System (AFIMS).
4.3. Readiness Program Reporting. Personnel assigned to deployable UTCs (D-Coded UTCs)
are used to calculate training percentages for SORTS, ART, and DRRS. Specific training items
considered SORTS reportable are identified in Table 4.1 below. This training will be included in
SORTS T-level calculations and will be provided to the AES commander for consideration in
ART and DRRS ESORTS readiness assessments.

                           READINESS EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS

A2.1. Purpose of Exercises. Exercises are conducted to evaluate an organization’s capability to
execute one or more portions of its response or contingency plans. Exercises should be scenario-
driven and designed to validate procedures and improve processes outlined in plans and planning
documents. Each exercise should provide a realistic rehearsal for deployment situations or
installation response, and may be conducted in a tabletop, functional, or full-scale format. As a
result, exercises provide excellent training opportunities that augment, but should not replace,
established training programs.

(Note: AE units must work with their wing/base/installation plans and programs office/EET to
determine the best way to conduct exercises required by other AFIs)

A2.2. Exercise Types. Exercises fall into one of three categories: tabletop or walkthrough
exercises (TTX), limited scope exercises which include functional (FX) and command post
exercises (CPX), or full-scale field training exercises (FTX). The scope of the exercise varies
widely based upon its type. Exercise planners can successfully blend exercise types (for
example, a field exercise where aeromedical evacuation is managed as a functional exercise
only) to achieve objectives. Review the exercise objectives carefully to determine the
appropriate exercise method for the situation.
   A2.2.1. Tabletop or Walkthrough Exercises (TTX). A tabletop exercise is frequently used to
   test a new plan or procedure. It is designed to allow participants to examine and resolve
   problems in an informal, stress-free environment. The success of the exercise is largely
   determined by group participation and the identification of problem areas. These exercises
   are particularly effective if led by an experienced facilitator. Tabletop exercises should be
   utilized judiciously.
   A2.2.2. Functional Exercise (FX) or Command Post Exercises (CPX). A functional exercise
   is a fully simulated exercise that tests multiple functions of an organization’s response to a
   simulated event. It is a time-pressured, realistic simulation. These exercises work well in a
   training environment if facilitated by experienced exercise controllers.
   A2.2.3. Field Training Exercise (FTX). An FTX simulates a real event as closely as
   possible. To accomplish this realism, it requires the mobilization and actual movement of

   personnel, equipment and resources. FTXs are excellent evaluation and training tools, but
   they are often costly and time-consuming to plan and execute.
A2.3. Exercise Design. Exercises should be designed to locate and eliminate problems in
response and contingency plans before an event occurs. Additionally, exercises enable personnel
to practice their roles, and gain experience and confidence prior to a contingency situation.
   A2.3.1. Exercise Objectives. Well constructed exercises include these objectives:
       A2.3.1.1. Test and evaluate plans, policies and procedures
       A2.3.1.2. Reveal planning weaknesses
       A2.3.1.3. Reveal gaps in resources
       A2.3.1.4. Improve organizational coordination and communications.
       A2.3.1.5. Clarify and practice roles and responsibilities
       A2.3.1.6. Improve individual and team performance
       A2.3.1.7. Demonstrate capabilities to associated organizations; gain support and develop
       teamwork.
       A2.3.1.8. Build upon past lessons learned to establish competence in all contingency-
       related functions.
   A2.3.2. Participants. Exercise participants are determined by the size and scope of the
   exercise. A TTX might include only key decision makers, while an FTX may include all
   members of the organization, supporting organizations, and the community. Additionally,
   the exercise participants may include simulated victims, controllers, evaluators, and
   observers. The planner must ensure safety for all participants during the exercise and
   coordinate transportation, messing, billeting, and administrative support when required.
   A2.3.3. Exercise Development and Planning Factors. Various planning factors combine to
   establish an effective exercise program.
       A2.3.3.1. Realism. Exercises must be realistic and contingency based. Unit response and
       contingency deployment capabilities vary widely. Therefore, each unit’s exercise
       program must be tailored to local capabilities both on and off base and take into
       consideration such factors as support/assistance agreements, local jurisdiction, other
       military unit capabilities, and contracts.
          A2.3.3.1.1. Minimize simulations, emphasize participation, and assess actual abilities
          consistent with safety, exercise objectives, and real-world constraints.
          A2.3.3.1.2. Overseas locations must also consider host nation agreements,
          noncombatant evacuation operations, humanitarian operations, and other factors.
          A2.3.3.1.3. Exercise scenarios should maximize opportunities for training by
          appropriately incorporating team or individual participation and operational processes
          and procedures.
   A2.3.4. Threat Vulnerability. Accurately assess the threat vulnerability on base and in the
   community and design exercise objectives consistent with that threat. Keep in mind that
   documents referencing specific vulnerabilities may be classified.

  A2.3.5. Community Participation. Test MOAs/MOUs/MAAs by inviting local community
  partners and on-base agencies to participate in the exercise, as appropriate.
  A2.3.6. Wing/Base Exercise Schedule and Availability. The unit should aggressively pursue
  opportunities to participate in Wing exercises. However, the absence of Wing exercises does
  not alter the unit’s overall requirements. In these situations, the unit should continue to
  conduct exercises IAW applicable directives.
