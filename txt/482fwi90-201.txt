       1.10.3. When EET members are using a role player from the EET moulage station, the
       role player will be given the identity of the affected exercise participant. The exercise
       participant will comply with EET instruction for duty reporting. The role player will
       maintain the exercise participant‘s identity throughout processing until released back to
       the moulage station.
       1.10.4. CVI may manage a designated ―attrition center‖ to increase exercise motivation
       and provide reinforced training. EET will send personnel to the attrition center for failing
       to take appropriate self-protective measures, not displaying the proper sense of urgency,
       or displaying a hostile/disrespectful attitude. Evaluators will note full name, rank and
       unit of assignment of individual attrited. Personnel will be out of action for a 4 to 12-
       hour work period (EET discretion) beginning immediately for the remainder of their shift
       and continue the next day until their requirement is completed. Personnel directed to the
       attrition center may be sent to process through the Contamination Control Area (CCA).
       Administrative support personnel may be used to monitor the attrition center to record
       names, times of reporting, and notify applicable UCC. Regardless of an attrition center
       activation, a list of attrited personnel and reason for attrition will be sent to 482 FW/CV
       at the completion of the exercise for dissemination to Group Commanders.
    1.11. Vehicle, Equipment, and Building Damage.
       1.11.1. Equipment/Vehicles. EET will tag all damaged/destroyed equipment and
       vehicles with a placard. A brief narrative will include damage/destruction/contamination
       and a get-well time. Simulated damaged equipment may be returned to service prior to
       the get-well time if repair/decontamination capability exists and is demonstrated.
       1.11.2. Buildings/Facilities. Simulated building/facility damage will be annotated on a
       placard by EET and placed at the facility Entry Control Point (ECP) with an established
       get well time/date. Damaged facilities will be prioritized and repaired IAW paragraph
       1.12.4 Buildings will be released back to units through the 482d Civil Engineers
       Squadron (482 CES) UCC with approval of 482 CES/EET.
       1.11.3. Relocation/Evacuation of Facilities. If a building is simulated damaged or
       destroyed, all occupants must be evacuated.                Exceptions include real world
       emergency/mission response or buildings containing classified material that cannot be
       secured or moved, funds, arms, or munitions. One person may remain inside these
       facilities to provide security. Facilities that maintain funds must be secured IAW AFI 31-
       401, Information Security Program Management
       1.11.4. Contracting/financial management support will be at the direction of 482 FW
       EET or simulated as host nation support.
       1.11.5. Replacement of Damaged or Destroyed Deployed Support Equipment at Base X.
       Deployed equipment custodian will contact host base 482d Logistics Readiness Squadron
       (482 LRS) with information on damaged equipment. Host base LRS will attempt to
       reallocate equipment to replace damaged or destroyed equipment. If reallocation of
       existing assets is not possible, host base 482 LRS personnel will contact the deployed
       custodian. The deployed custodian will contact home station LRS for reconstitution.
    1.12. Commercial Power/Water Outage.
482FWI90-201 26 OCTOBER 2011                                                                  7


     1.12.1. The objective of these scenarios is to evaluate the ability to continue operations
     without commercial power for at least 24 hours. 482 CES personnel may be tasked to
     simulate damage to off-base commercial power facilities or lines beyond their ability to
     repair. 482 CES electricians will monitor actions taken.
     1.12.2. For a disruption in electrical power, host nation support (e.g. the BOS contractor)
     is responsible for generator start and continual use. They will maintain and monitor
     emergency generators.
     1.12.3. Units will be given guidance prior to the evaluation, including the facilities and
     times.
     1.12.4. The 482 FW Command Post (482 FW/CP), 482d Security Forces Squadron, Law
     Enforcement (482 SFS/LE) desk and tasked unit‘s UCC will be notified at least 30
     minutes prior to the beginning of power outage scenarios affecting their facility to ensure
     real world operations are not affected.
     1.12.5. Base Water Supply Disruption: if there is a shutdown of service, 482 CES will
     notify the base of the outage send out a boil notice until distribution is proven safe.
     Details will be coordinated with the 482 CES EET. If water disruption does not affect
     the entire installation, damage cards will be located on facilities to show time frames of
     water outage.
  1.13. Supply Procedures.
     1.13.1. When exercising at Base X, BOS and certain civilian positions as determined by
     482 EET will act as host base support.
     1.13.2. For Base X scenarios the following procedures apply:
         1.13.2.1. The Regional Supply Squadron (RSS) will source for assets affecting real
         world Not Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) assets that are not in the Mobility
         Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) and are required at Base X. If available at Base
         X, then the asset will be made available immediately. If the part is not available at
         Base X, the deployed aircraft receiving these parts cannot be used until after the
         simulated delivery time (IAW Para. 1.14.3) to the deployed location.
         1.13.2.2. Expendable part requirements will be filled from deployed bench stock, if
         available. If not, then they may be filled from MRSP or the Consumables Readiness
         Spares Package (CRSP). If the part is not available from the first two sources, then
         the part may be requested from the Base X aircraft parts store. In this case, the part
         will be ordered under an exercise activity code with the appropriate organization code
         and an exercise series document number.
     1.13.3. Supply Transportation Delays.
         1.13.3.1. If part is in MRSP it is immediately available. If the part is not
         immediately available, the ship time will be determined by 482 EET.
     1.13.4. MRSP/CRSP replenishments (due-out releases) received at Base X will be
     delivered to building 213 IAW normal procedures. These items will only be made
     available to the deployed LRS personnel after a DD Form 1149, Requisition and
     Invoice/Shipping Document has been prepared. Required time frames from Para 1.14.3
8                                                          482FWI90-201 26 OCTOBER 2011


       must elapse from the date/time of document preparation to simulate pipeline time before
       items are released.
       1.13.5. Phase supply transactions will not be processed through the deployed Combat
       Supply Activity (CSA).
       1.13.6. CSA will deploy with a computer loaded with up-to-date copies of appropriate
       software, and will demonstrate the process of transferring the MRSP to the deployed
       location.
       1.13.7. Items issued from the deployed MRSP/CRSP and deemed Not Repairable This
       Station (NRTS) by deployed Base X maintenance will be prepared for shipment to the
       Base X Flight Service Center (FSC).
       1.13.8. Turn-in actions on repairable assets issued from the Base X supply will be
       processed through the FSC.
       1.13.9. NMCS Conditions Mission Capable Slides(MICAPS). MICAP slides will only
       show simulated deployed aircraft MICAPs. During exercises/inspections the CSA should
       provide the MICAP/NMCS data for deployed aircraft.
    1.14. Nerve Agent Antidote Simulators.
       1.14.1. Issue may be individual or bulk, and will originate, with advice from the Major
       Command Surgeon (MAJCOM/SG), from the simulated Theater Commander or the
       MAJCOM.
       1.14.2. Phase I. Medical Logistics will distribute simulated Soman Nerve Agent

     will begin immediately after units provide names of deploying personnel.
     2.2.6. Personnel Shortfalls.
         2.2.6.1. Units will submit personnel shortfalls to the IDO. The IDO will submit the
         shortfalls to 482 FW/CVI with 482 FW/CC approval. Units will not make shortfall
         requests directly to 482 FW/CVI.
         2.2.6.2. Unit Type Codes (UTCs) that cannot be filled due to manning shortages,
         medical profiles, or non-world wide deployable status, should be shortfall. Local
         leave, AUGFOR, etc, are not reasons for shortfalls.
         2.2.6.3. Shortfall justifications must include manning statistics to include authorized,
         assigned, available to deploy, number of personnel currently assigned to UTCs, and
         specific non-deployable justification, if applicable.
     2.2.7. Personnel Simulations.
         2.2.7.1. Upon approval by 482 FW/CVI, all non-participating personnel that are
         recallable and can meet assigned tasking can be simulated. The simulation request
         must be accompanied by a recall message for the affected personnel. The request will
         clearly identify when the individual will be simulated available.
         2.2.7.2. EET members reflected against a unit deployment position number may be
         simulated for Phase I deployment. Simulation requests are not required. However,

     components with service/shelf life restrictions or hermetically sealed containers will not
     be opened with the exception of impulse cartridges. Hermetically sealed components
     will be delivered to the build up area, but will not be installed on assembled munitions.
     Instead, inert munitions of the same type will be used to demonstrate tasks involved in
     assembly. These inert components will be removed from assembled munitions prior to
     delivery to the flight line.
     2.3.4. Weapons loading/unloading activities, including completion times, simulated
     actions, and simulated loads, will be recorded in the aircraft‘s AF Form 2408, Generation

     2.3.5. The full SCL will remain loaded until EET acceptance, after which the deploying
     unit may download munitions and reconfigure aircraft as required. Weapons supervisors
     will accomplish AF Form 2434, Munitions Configuration and Expenditure Document to
     indicate simulated and actual configurations.
     2.3.6. An aircraft is considered generated when the pilot signs the pilot acceptance. The
     aircraft is then ―off limits‖ until the EET inspection is complete.
     2.3.7. The 482 AMXS Production Superintendent will inform EET of aircraft
     availability/priority for acceptance inspections. EET will report all discrepancies to the
     482 AMXS Production Superintendent and make an AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
     Discrepancy and Work Document, entry when their inspection is complete. Aircraft
     inspection, acceptance, and generation scoring will be performed IAW procedures in AFI

      dictates otherwise.
      2.7.6. Aircraft will be regenerated to meet Integrated Tasking Order (ITO) configuration
      requirements unless directed otherwise.
      2.7.7. Base X Aircraft Regeneration. Munitions support for regeneration will occur in
      the pre-designated Base X portion of the Munitions Storage Area (MSA). Only deployed
      personnel and equipment will be utilized during the regeneration. The Base X MSA,
      Munitions Control facility and482d Maintenance Group, Operations Center (482
      MXG/MOC) will be determined prior to each exercise. The 482 MXG/MOC will control
      aircraft regeneration.
      2.7.8. Each aviation UTC will be limited to the number of vehicles listed in the Base X
      IGESP. Vehicles will be in place at the applicable location prior to the first chalk
      arriving at Base X. If a deployed vehicle has a UHF radio installed, the radio may be
      used immediately upon arrival at Base X. Units will provide a list of vehicles at Base X
      for 482 MXG/93 FS use and will be limited to the exercise Vehicle Authorization Listing
      (VAL), which is coordinated through 482 LRS/Fleet Management prior to STARTEX.
      Deployed vehicles will be marked with an approved EET placard/sign.
      2.7.9. Deployed Aerospace Ground Equipment will be IAW the Base X IGESP and

   3.2. For separated Phase I/II OREs, a minimum of one Transition Day will precede all Phase
   II activities to configure Base X. Assumptions in para 3.1.1 – 3.1.4 apply. Infrastructure that
   does not interfere with Phase I activities may be set up at the discretion of 482 FW EET.
4. Phase II Readiness Exercise/Inspection.
   4.1. Phase II Ground Rules.
      4.1.1. Personnel who normally work in a no-play area and must enter a play area to
      perform official business must wear IPE/CWDE and react to all alarm conditions and
      exercise scenarios. This condition also applies to EET members who must perform
      duties as participants (e.g. give situational briefing inputs at the 482 FW/CP).
      4.1.2. Personnel in no-play areas will not wear IPE/CWDE and will not respond to alarm
      conditions or other exercise inputs unless directed by EET (e.g. SOF).
      4.1.3. 482 FW/CVI will determine exercise ―core‖ hours. All personnel not assigned to
      shift work to cover command and control or flying related operations will be at their duty
      station or performing their primary duty during core hours.
      4.1.4. Organizations should stagger shift work to cover command and control, flying
      related operations and other essential duties to cover responsibilities outside of core
      hours.
      4.1.5. Only those assets deployed to or available at Base X may be used by personnel in
      the Base X play area. The TPFDD will be used in conjunction with the tasking message
      or LOIs to determine what 482 FW equipment is deployed.
      4.1.6. All military personnel assigned to Homestead ARB are considered exercise
      players as determined by the 482 FW/CC. Participants not identified in applicable O-
      Plan UTCs will act as host base support personnel.
   4.2. Personnel Processing Area (PPA).
      4.2.1. The purpose of the PPA is to provide a clearly defined transition from rest to
      exercise participation status, ensure individual readiness, and enhance C2 during the
      Phase II portion of the ORE/I.

         4.2.4.3. Obtain available current information (e.g. knock codes, chem codes, re-
         located work centers, etc).
         4.2.4.4 Obtain your Accountability Card (A-Card). The A-Card will be issued upon
         your initial PPA processing. All personnel must have their A-Card on their person
         when not in a facility during the Phase II.
            4.2.4.4.1. Obtain your sticker following the play area entry briefing. Each day of
            the Phase II will have a different sticker to designated the individual has
            processed through the PPA and is aware of all BSDs/Chemical/Duress Codes,
            etc..
         4.2.4.5. PPA in-processing will cease under Alarm Blue/Red/Black conditions unless
         shift change/movement is authorized by the SS. Personnel will stand by at the PPA
         until authorization for movement is granted.
     4.2.5. Personnel Processing Area Out-processing.
         4.2.5.1. Upon being released from duty, personnel will react to all alarm conditions
         between their work center and the PPA (e.g., if you come under attack on the way to a
         bus stop, take appropriate duck and cover actions).
         4.2.5.2. Personnel are not allowed movement (i.e. transition from work center to bus
         stop) in ―Alarm Blue/Red/Black‖ conditions unless authorized by the SS.
         4.2.5.3. Personnel will out-process through the PPA. Out-processing will continue
         regardless of alarm condition.

            4.2.6.2.2. The Casualty Collection Point (CCP) and patient decontamination
            areas are play areas.
  4.3. Attack Response/Protective Measures.
     4.3.1. Duck and cover reactions will be in accordance with local and Base X guidance.
     There is no requirement to duck and cover in approved semi-hardened facilities if the
     facility is intact. Normally only the EOC/ICC is considered semi-hardened. Participants
     will operate using procedures for the type of facility they would have at Base X. No
     more than 50% of Aircraft shelters at Base X are semi-hardened; determination will be by
     482 FW/CVI.
18                                                      482FWI90-201 26 OCTOBER 2011


     4.3.2. All personnel must be familiar with the USAF standardized alarm signals.
     Homestead will use the warbling siren capability, sound bugle calls and announce the
     current alarm condition in plain language.
     4.3.3. Alarm Blue is used in place of Alarm Red for Base X scenarios in the Pacific Air
     Command (PACAF) theater.
     4.3.4. Air Base Defense Sectors are depicted in Attachment 2. During ground attacks,
     the Ground Defense Commander (through SFS ESF representative/Base Defense
     Operations Center (BDOC)) will recommend a Bugle Call, response actions to ground
     attacks and notification of threat termination to the SS. In a wartime environment, force
     protection condition changes are not linked to ground attacks. 482 FW/CP will sound the
     bugle call and make an announcement that a ground attack is in progress. They will
     indicate if a base wide attack is occurring or specify the affected sectors. Additionally,
     radio, telephone, or other means will be used to convey in clear language what is
     happening and what actions to take.
     4.3.5. The 482 FW will use small brown paper bags to simulate the M291/ M295 kits or
     other ACC/IG approved simulation guidance.
     4.3.6. Pilots will comply with the 93 FS Smart Pack, for alarm response.
     4.3.7. Aircraft taxiing prior to attack will follow the procedures outlined in the 93 FS
     Smart Pack which complies with the ACC/IG Standard Simulation for either launch for
     survival or simulate nose-in sheltering. Crew chiefs may obtain a Joint Oil Analysis
     Program (JOAP) sample on aircraft shut-down during the attack; after the sample is
     taken, the crew chief will return immediately to the HAS.
     4.3.8. Aircraft with canopies left open during chemical attacks will be out of action for
     12 hours.
     4.3.9. If a bus driver in an exercise/inspection play area encounters unexploded ordnance
     (UXO) while driving, the driver will stop the bus and notify the passengers. The bus will
     remain stopped until the ranking passenger designates one or more person onboard to
     cordon the UXO. Buses should have UXO marking materials available. The driver will
     notify vehicle dispatch of UXO location(s) and resume movement while avoiding the
     UXO.
     4.3.10. Movement in Alarm Black must be specifically authorized by the senior ranking
     SS member. This will normally be conveyed via Alarm Black Initial Release, Limited
     Release and General Release conditions.
  4.4. Contamination Control Area (CCA)
     4.4.1. The 482 CES Readiness Flight is the OPR for the wing‘s CCA.
     4.4.2. The 482 FW will demonstrate its ability to operate a CCA.
     4.4.3. 482 CES will request and the 482 FW/CC will be task units to provide trained
     personnel to operate the CCA.
     4.4.4. At the completion of CCA processing, personnel will sign a roster to verify
     processing. The CCA lead will give a copy of all sign-in rosters to EET for validation.
482FWI90-201 26 OCTOBER 2011                                                                  19


     4.4.5. Exercise casualties will not be transported to the CCA for decontamination. All
     contaminated exercise patients will be transported to the casualty decontamination
     facility/CCP.
  4.5. Pilot Chemical Warfare Procedures.
     4.5.1. Pilots en route to/from pilot rest are not required to perform CCA processing.
     4.5.2. 482d Operations Group Life Support (482 OG/OGL) will set-up an aircrew CCA
     (ACCA) processing line in a location that ensures pilot decontamination prior to entry
     into the 93 FS operations facility or AELAM/DDF area, if necessary. Pilots entering or
     exiting these facilities during Alarm Black will normally simulate processing through the
     ACCA, unless Life Support is exercising/demonstrating their ACCA capability. 482
     OG/OGL personnel will determine the extent of processing based on the time lapse
     between attacks. The squadron Top Three has the authority to waive processing
     requirements to meet mission requirements but only as a last resort. The 482 FW EET
     work center will be notified immediately.
  4.6. Airfield Attacks. The airfield is subject to exercise aircraft attacks. These attacks will
  be announced through Warlord to the 482 FW/CP or ICC.

  treatment. Casualties will normally be transported to the Medical Treatment Facility or CCP
  using vehicles of opportunity.
  4.13. Vehicle and Asset Cover Plan will be IAW ACC/IG STD SIM.
     4.13.1. Each unit‘s UCC will identify/mark what assets have been designated to be
     covered for chemical warfare environments and the locations of those assets. Units will,
     as a minimum, cover one critical asset identified in their plan (e.g. vehicles/AGE).
     Assets will be covered with two layers of plastic to demonstrate expedient cover
     capability. Assets will be high use assets routinely used during the exercise/inspection.
     Assets not covered with plastic, but identified in the unit cover plan must comply with
     ACC/IG approved simulations.
     4.13.2. Capability demonstration will include covering assets, performing cover material
     change-out and disposing of contaminated waste IAW the installation contaminated

     and equipment available at the deployed location.
     4.15.6. The Base Defense Operation Center (BDOC) will handle communication
     between the live intruder area and the EOC. Communications may consist of real-time
     events at Camp Defender/scripted events via EET inject cards.
  4.16. Fighter Squadron Operations.
     4.16.1. The Integrated Tasking Order/Air Tasking Order (ITO/ATO) will be developed
     by 482 FW/CVI and 482d Operations Group Intelligence (482 OG/DOI). All
     participating units (blue and red) will be fragged in the ITO/ATO.
     4.16.2. The 93 FS will set up a designated area for 482 EET DVR review. Hit criteria,
     sortie documentation, and DVR procedures will be IAW 3-1. Fighter squadrons will save
     alibi sheets from each pilot and one copy of all mission materials per flight until reviewed
     by EET. Alibi sheets must clearly identify the number of the DVR used for each sortie
     and should be used to bring attention to any pertinent information that the pilot feels the
     EET member should know. Alibi sheets will be filled out whether or not the sortie is
     flown
  4.17. Life Support/Pilot Escape and Evasion.
     4.17.1. Life Support EET will determine the time and place of the evaluation, if required.
     4.17.2. When tasked, the 93 FS will provide one pilot, current in combat escape and
     evasion. The exercise will take place in an EET specifically designated location and
     duration. Names, dates, and times will be identified through exercise communications
     channels. Pilots will be evaluated on their ability to recall information on their
     ISOPREP, Evasion Plan of Action (EPA), CSAR-SPINS, and employing survival
     techniques applicable to the scenario. Participants are exempt from MOPP requirements
     during this evaluation.

     while performing the EOR inspection, but will comply with the directed MOPP
     immediately upon completion.
     4.18.3. Simulated Hardened Aircraft Shelters (HAS) will have walls marked with rope,
     flagging ribbon, or other approved simulation, the HAS doors marked with cones, and be
     no more than 45 feet wide. Only one aircraft may be parked in a simulated HAS.
     4.18.4. Simulated HAS‘s will be determined by 482 FW/CVI and 482 MXG EET; no
     more than 50% of tasked aircraft will be parked in HAS‘s.
482FWI90-201 26 OCTOBER 2011                                                               23


     4.18.5. Maintenance may be performed in a secured HGS (real or simulated) during
     Alarm Black No/Initial release, provided powered AGE equipment is not being utilized
     and the HAS, has been swept for possible UXOs/damage/contamination. For any
     maintenance, all required equipment must have been pre-positioned in the HAS prior to
     the attack. Once Alarm Black Limited/General release is called, the 482 FW/CC may
     authorize mission essential tasks to continue. If authorized, HAS doors may be opened to
     the 10-foot mark and powered age operations may resume (i.e. weapons loading, power
     on checks, etc).
  4.19. Sortie Generation - Weapons.
     4.19.1. Aircraft will only fly with expendable munitions (live or inert) that are planned
     for employment. Under no circumstances will WRM Munitions be flown.
     4.19.2. Aircraft will be configured for the complete tasked SCL.
     4.19.3. All weapons loading/unloading activities, including simulated actions and
     simulated loads, will be recorded as an ―INFO note‖ in the aircraft‘s AFTO Form 781A,
     Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document..
     4.19.4. CATM-9, CATM-120 missiles may be used to fill tasked SCLs, when available.
     Live air-to-air missiles will not be used.
     4.19.5. All air-to-ground munitions will be considered expended on each sortie flown.
     Air-to-air missile, gun and ALE-50 expenditures will be based on the pilot‘s simulated
     usage or EET input. Pilots will annotate the preprinted AFTO Form 781, ARMS
     Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, by signing off the ―INFO note‖ with
     expenditures following each sortie.
     4.19.6. Reloads for all munitions will be demonstrated using half-down/half-up
     procedures.
     4.19.7. For CATM-120 expenditures, only station #9 will be used for half-down/half-up
     regardless of pilot reported expenditures.
     4.19.8. Live munitions will not be used.
     4.19.9. During the reload process (either half-up/half-down or half-down/half-up), load
     crews will remove the appropriate number of ribbons (or other approved simulation that
     tracks the # of munitions on that trailer) from munitions representing the number of
     weapons simulated loaded. They will then annotate the load on the AF Form 2434,
     Munitions Configuration and Expenditure Document and as an ―INFO note‖ on the
     AFTO Form 781.
     4.19.10. Impulse cartridge removal/installation will be accomplished IAW 482 MXG
     EET approved simulation letter.
     4.19.11. If fuse and delay options are not specified on the ITO/ATO/flying schedule,
     Munitions Flight will coordinate with Squadron Top Three or the Mission Planning Cell
     (MPC) Chief.
     4.19.12. All guns will be reloaded when the system falls below 50 percent capacity based
     on simulated usage reported by the pilot or EET input. During simulated reloads of TP
     ammo, the universal ammunition loading system (UALS) will be connected to the aircraft
24                                                        482FWI90-201 26 OCTOBER 2011


     and a full belt of TP ammo will be run through the UALS in bypass. When the load is
     complete, UALS forms documentation is required. TP ammo will not be removed from
     storage nor will rounds be removed from the aircraft if loaded.
     4.19.13. Upon each weapons reload, the Weapons Expeditor will enter the
     loading/unloading information on the AF Form 2434. All weapons expenditures (both
     simulated and actual) will be documented; a separate AF Form 2434 will be prepared for
     actual and for simulated expenditures. The AF Form 2434 will be delivered to Munitions
     Control within 2 hours of the last aircraft down time for the day. If the flying window
     crosses midnight, midnight will be the cutoff and the AF Form 2434 will be delivered to
     Munitions Control NLT 0200. Aircraft that launch, are in flight, or are recovered after
     midnight will be entered on the following day's AF Form 2434. Weapons personnel will
     annotate assembly lot numbers for all GP bombs, CBUs and GBUs on the AF Form
     2434. Signed AF Form 2434s will be hand-carried or faxed to 482 MXG EET NLT 0800
     daily.
     4.19.14. Trailers that have had their ribbons (or other approved simulation) removed,
     denoting that all munitions were used to generate aircraft, will be returned to the MSA
     and re-supplied at the production/processing facility or storage location before reuse. If
     for any reason munitions were not expended and downloaded, the ribbons will be
     reattached to the trailer.
     4.19.15. After Firing Inspection Requirements. Aircraft -6 inspections will be performed
     on all stations that fired. Tools, technical data and expendables will be available at each
     aircraft at the end of the flying day. After fire inspections will be performed for
     simulated and/actual launching/firing/releasing of munitions, gun and AME. To simulate
     inspections:
         4.19.15.1. Personnel will remain at the aircraft for amount of time required to
         perform the appropriate inspections/maintenance (time based on 1 individual
         performing after fire inspection).
            4.19.15.1.1. MAU-12, 10 minutes per station.
            4.19.15.1.2. TER-9, 15 minutes per station.
            4.19.15.1.3. LAU-117/118/129, 10 minutes per station.

            4.19.15.1.5. AN/ALE-50, 10 minutes per station.
            4.19.15.1.6. Gun, 45 minutes.
         4.19.15.2. All inspections actual or simulated will be documented.
     4.19.16. Aircraft that were not generated with munitions as described above may fly but
     their sorties will not be counted as effective.
  4.20. Sortie Generation – Munitions.
     4.20.1. Simulated combat pre-issue inspection procedures will be used. See 2.3.3.
     4.20.2. Re-supply capability will be demonstrated by breakout and delivery of munitions
     from storage locations and delivered to production sites. Half of these munitions will be
482FWI90-201 26 OCTOBER 2011                                                                 25


     off-loaded and uploaded from/to the transport vehicle at the production site, then returned
     to the storage location where half will be off-loaded/uploaded to demonstrate continued
     re-supply, if required. Production sites may use inert munitions and components to
     demonstrate assembly and trailer loading capability using half-up/half-down procedures.
     Additionally, munitions breakout and production sites may use half-up/half-down
     procedures at storage locations and production sites to show capability to load/unload
     vehicles transporting/delivering munitions and components.
  4.21. Sortie Generation - Fuel Tanks.
     4.21.1. No more than 25 percent of the daily sorties will have simulated expended tanks
     (EET will identify specific aircraft).
     4.21.2. External fuel tank expenditures will be based on exercise inputs of tanks
     simulated jettisoned and will be reported to maintenance and recorded in aircraft forms
     after each affected sortie. If fuel tanks are required for subsequent sorties, the aircraft
     may not be used until all actions necessary to simulate the replacement fuel tanks have
     occurred.
     4.21.3. Comply with all normal tank down-loading/up-loading procedures except for fuel
     transfer check. If the aircraft must immediately prepare for launch, normal leak and
     transfer checks are not required. Individual AFTO Form 781A entries will be made for
     tank jettison checks, leak check and fuel indication/transfer check. The tank jettison
     check must be completed prior to installing impulse carts. The crew chief will comply
     with external leak check upon engine start. The pilot will confirm tank indication and
     operation (feeding) prior to takeoff and clear the forms after flight.
     4.21.4. Upon notification of simulated fuel tank expenditures, maintenance shall
     coordinate the requisition and delivery of all required (WRM or available spare) fuel
     tanks with supply. To simulate re-supply of WRM tanks, host base supply will deliver
     simulated WRM tanks to the requested destination with a suitable vehicle after the
     request for replacement tanks is received and processed by AMU/host base supply.
     4.21.5. Once replacement fuel tanks are available at the required location, maintenance
     will actually download and replace one fuel tank to simulate the replacement of all
     jettisoned tanks. However, all required replacement fuel tanks, personnel, support
     equipment, tools, and consumables shall be available at the aircraft for the actual
     replacement period. A replacement fuel tank shall be installed, follow-on maintenance
     performed, and the replacement tank flown to validate the serviceability of assets. Tanks
     downloaded as simulated jettisoned may not be used for the remainder of the exercise.
  4.22. Sortie Generation – Halon.
     4.22.1. Following Phase II sorties, up to 20 percent of all aircraft halon bottles (as
     designated by 482 MXG EET) will be replaced with a simulated full bottle prior to the
     next flight.
  4.23. Sortie Generation – Fuels.
     4.23.1. All 482 FW aircraft deployed to Base X will be supported by 8 refueling units,
     one de-fueling unit and up to two hot pits. Additionally, 17 fuels personnel will be
 26                                                         482FWI90-201 26 OCTOBER 2011


      assigned to handle 24-hour Base X operations.           Two flight line expediters will be
      available for day and night shifts.
   4.24. CANN Jets. Upon a required cannibalization action at Base X, a the first available
   hard broke aircraft will be identified to the MOC and MXG EET as the CANN aircraft.
   After identification, parts may be removed from the CANN aircraft. Once a part is removed,
   the Base X CANN aircraft will carry the appropriate simulated aircraft status and will not be
   able available IAW ACC/IG Standard Simulations. As parts are received from 482 LRS and
   the appropriate time has lapsed for part replacement and operational checks, the aircraft
   status may be changed.

     5.5.3. Evaluators must be trained on the use of smoke and ground-burst simulators
     before initial use. The 482 FW/CVI will maintain a list of EET members who have been
     trained with pyrotechnic devices.
     5.5.4. All EET members are ―trusted agents‖ and will not divulge information relating to
     exercises. Any individual found to have divulged trusted agent information will be
     immediately removed from the team.
     5.5.5. Any additional training required for EET members will be tasked and tracked by
     482 FW/CVI.
  5.6. EET Training Materials:
     5.6.1. Inert UXOs (OPR: 482 CES Explosive Ordinance - CED)
     5.6.2. Exercise Scenario (OPR: 482 FW/CVI)
     5.6.3. Local base grid maps, scaled cordon overlay, Base X, and appropriate off-base
     maps (OPR: 482 MSG/CEX)

         procedures to ensure availability and requirements pertaining to use.
     5.6.8. Provide operational aircraft required for individual exercises (OPR: 482 OG/CC)
     Note: Coordination must be made with the OPR before the exercise to ensure
     availability of materials.
  5.7. Exercise Munitions.
     5.7.1. Ground burst simulators (GBS), if used, will simulate detonations/explosions of
     missiles, bombs, rockets, mortars, and artillery shells. Smoke grenades/pots/flares, if
     used, will simulate fires and impact areas.
         5.7.1.1. Location of smoke grenades and GBSs must be planned to minimize the
         possibility of creating hazards or obstructions to essential operations. Safety
         equipment will be readily available and, upon completion of the exercise, the site will
         be policed by EET for FOD and leftover debris.
     5.7.2. Exercise munitions used during local exercises will only be detonated after 482
     FW Weapons Safety (482 FW/SEW) and 482 FW/CVI have coordinated and approved
     requested detonation locations. 482 FW/CVI will provide a ―Risk Assessment and
     Authorization to use Exercise Munitions‖ letter and map to identify where GBSs/smokes
     will be used to be approved by the 482 FW/CV NLT 5 days prior to STARTEX.
         5.7.3.1. Only qualified personnel will be authorized to expend/detonate exercise
         munitions used during local exercises.
482FWI90-201 26 OCTOBER 2011                                                                29

        5.8.1.1. Coordinate the date and time of the exercise with the 482 FW/CC.
        5.8.1.2. Determine primary exercise objectives in conjunction with group EET leads
        and owning agencies by reviewing taskings, procedures in applicable OPLANS and
        CONPLANS, previous exercise reports, MAJCOM Special Interest Items (SII) and
        findings from other bases.
        5.8.1.3. Determine a scenario that will satisfy the objectives.
        5.8.1.4. Coordinate with senior 482 MSG/CEX EET member to develop
        attack/exercise scenarios for all wing exercises (e.g. meteorological data for attacks,
        type of agent, method of delivery, type of release, hazard footprint and persistency).
        5.8.1.5. Ensure no exercise prop will cause a FOD or safety hazard.
     5.8.2. Group EET Leads will:
        5.8.2.1. Assist 482 FW/CVI with development of exercise scenarios appropriate to
        their Group responsibilities.

        exercises.
     5.8.3. Team Members will:
        5.8.3.1. Be tasked to provide inputs for their portion of the exercise. Team members
        are responsible for ensuring scripts contain appropriate inputs to complete exercise
        objectives. Scenario inputs, will be due to the EET Team Chief by the established
        suspense, normally, a minimum of 2 weeks before the exercise.
        5.8.3.2. The 482 FW/CP senior member is responsible for arranging the use of the
        base Giant Voice system.
        5.8.3.3. Unit team leads and assigned EET members will develop and maintain
        detailed checklists for their respective area of evaluation to specifically evaluate
        locally established procedures contained in applicable OPLANS and other local
        CONPLANS.
30                                                       482FWI90-201 26 OCTOBER 2011


         5.8.3.4. Unit leads will coordinate all unit EET activities, attend all EET meetings
         during exercises, and attend planning meetings as appropriate for the scenario.
     5.8.4. All EET members will be familiar with ACC/IG grading criteria listed in AFI 90-
     201_ACC SUP_1_ADDENDA A.
     5.8.5. Exercise Ground Rules/Conduct of the Exercise.
         5.8.5.1. The exercise work center (Warlord Ops) will normally be located at building
         596. Another suitable location may be utilized as determined by 482 FW/CVI.
         Under normal conditions, one member of the 482 FW/CVI offices is available at the
         work center during all exercise hours.
  5.9. Initiation of the Exercise.
     5.9.1. 482 FW/CVI will initiate all exercises. Unit team leads are responsible for
     managing their respective areas of evaluation and may take initiatives as they see fit
     within the guidelines of the scenarios, sequence of events, and ground rules.
     5.9.2. Group leads assist 482 FW/CVI with determining ratings within their assigned
     area based on compliance with published procedures and compliance with safety
     procedures. They will assist/prepare written comments with justification for ratings
     above and below SATISFACTORY. However, EET members should allow the event
     being evaluated to take its natural course and should not interfere as long as valuable
     training can be safely gained.
  5.10. Exercise Scenario.
     5.10.1. Develop exercise scenario ground rules IAW AFI 10-2501 or AFI 90-201_ACC
     SUP_1. Ensure scenarios are designed to simulate the stress and pressure that would
     occur during a real incident.
     5.10.2. There are many attack response exercises that will be conducted to test the
     wing‘s ability to survive, operate, and recover from the effects of attacks by hostile
     forces. These attacks may range from terrorist activities, active shooters and sabotage to
     acts of general war. Exercise attack situations will be built around a credible intelligence
     scenario that accurately portrays the potential enemy threat in our area of operation.
     Exercises are intended to provide as much realism as possible.
     5.10.3. Infiltrators. Inspection team members and augmentees may be used as
     perpetrators during infiltrator exercises. In these instances EET will not surreptitiously
     use their credentials as an EET member to allow access or confuse personnel attempting
     to apprehend them. Where possible, EET should use a third party to play infiltrators.
     5.10.4. Smoke grenades, if used, will be placed in a can when in high concrete areas.
     5.10.5. Damaged/Destroyed/Contaminated status labels. EET inject cards/forms will be
     used        to     designate        damaged,        destroyed,    or      contaminated
     facilities/equipment/vehicles/areas. A brief narrative description will be included to
     clarify exact damage, destruction or contamination. Attrition information and fire
     fighting information will also be posted, as applicable.
     5.10.6. Simulated Casualties (wounded or dead). Moulage is the preferred method of
     simulated casualties. When moulage is not possible, inject cards will be used to identify
482FWI90-201 26 OCTOBER 2011                                                                 31


     casualties. Casualties should not be confused with personnel attrite for improper IPE or
     inadequate attack response. All casualty requests must be coordinated through 482 MDS
     EET.
     5.10.7. Simulated Craters. If required for specific scenario training, bomb/rocket craters
     will be marked on taxiways and parking aprons with traffic cones. Cones can be used to
     mark craters in the middle of the taxiway providing aircraft aren't taxiing around it and
     airfield management is notified through proper command channels. Airfield management
     will decide whether to close taxiway. Aircraft and vehicles will not be allowed to
     traverse through simulated craters. Vehicles operating within coned off areas may
     become disabled based on EET determination on scene. Craters in the runway will
     normally be simulated at an alternate location (for exercise repair purposes) or delineated
     on base maps (for C2 exercise purposes).
     5.10.8. Communication Outages (COMM-OUT). Throughout the exercise, various
     communications systems will be removed to see the wings capability for back-up
     systems. COMM-OUT procedures will be carried out until sufficient procedures have
     been followed to restore communications. During COMM-OUT procedures, great care
     will be taken to avoid emergency lines such as 911, and critical real world command and
     control hubs such as Command Post Emergency Action (EA) Cell.
  5.11. Reports. Required operational reports (voice and message) such as OPREPs,
  SITREPs, etc. will be prepared, but not transmitted. Prepared reports will be given to the
  EET member evaluating the functional area submitting the report or given to Command Post
  EET to forward to 482 FW/CVI. Additionally, the events log in the EOC and other base
  control centers will be made available for review after the exercise.
  5.12. EET Ground Rules.
     5.12.1. Dress Code for Evaluators. Normally, pressed BDUs or flight suits will be worn.
     Members will wear IPE/MOPP only as directed by the Chief, 482 FW EET. EET vests
     and badges (as required) will be worn/clearly displayed.
     5.12.2. Consider the safety of all operations. SAFETY is paramount, and EET members
     will discontinue exercise events to ensure safety of all personnel.
  5.13. EET Post-Exercise Activities.
     5.13.1. Following ENDEX, 482 FW/CVI will establish a meeting place and time for the
     following:
         5.13.1.1. Initial ―Post Exercise‖ Meeting. This meeting will be attended by all
         functional area EET team leads. The purpose of this meeting is to facilitate the flow
         of information between EET members, helping to build the ―big picture‖ of what
         happened and to help identify wing wide trends. All exercise evaluation reports will
         be due IAW suspense's established by 482 FW/CVI personnel.
         5.13.1.2. EET Hot Wash. All group leads will attend this meeting (as a minimum)
         with the purpose of reviewing and validating wing out brief slides (as required).
         5.13.1.3. A Wing Out brief will be scheduled for all OREs/EMEs. This will
         normally be held in the Wing Conference Room and will give the Chief of EET an
         opportunity to present all inputs to the 482 FW/CC and all unit commanders for
 32                                                       482FWI90-201 26 OCTOBER 2011


          discussion prior to publishing the report. All Group EET leads will attend the out
          brief.
   5.14. Reporting Exercise Deficiencies (Findings).
      5.14.1. All wing deficiencies should be reported to CVI via the evaluation report as
      directed by 482 FW/CVI. EET members should gather all facts concerning the
      deficiency and try to ascertain what the root problem is. Findings should be submitted,
      highlighting the root cause, with various symptoms (observation) listed as sub-bullets.
      Where applicable, the regulation affecting the finding should be listed, grades for the area
      evaluated submitted, and EET recommendations and solutions listed.
      5.14.2. Validation. Conducted with affected units as soon as possible. Face-to-face
      validation is preferred but not required. Telephone/email validation is authorized.
      Validating findings with the unit is an important element of integrity of the inspection.
      Validation is accomplished through open and frank discussions between the EET and
      inspected units.
      5.14.3. If an observation involves a functional area outside that of the evaluator
      submitting the observation they must discuss it with an EET member from that respective
      area prior to submitting to database.
      5.14.4. Evaluators must validate the finding. Evaluators must address the cause of the
      problem, confirm the facts and identify references. If possible, a review of what is
      believed to be the conditions, impact, and cause should be done with the responsible
      individual and his/her boss. The purpose of the validation process is to identify potential
      problems before writing them in the report.
   5.15. Guidance for Writing Observations.
      5.15.1. Superior Performer. Should be used for recognizing individuals for truly
      exceptional performance. Evaluators must remember to include the grade and full
      name(s) of individual(s). All superior performer inputs must have sub-bullet statements
      justifying the inputs.
      5.15.2. Strengths. Should be used to document a unit‘s strong areas. Strengths should
      identify things units do that are innovative and creative to allow them to accomplish the
      mission easier, more efficient, faster, etc. OPR/OCR not required.
      5.15.3. Findings. An observation is a finding if it involves a failure to comply with AFI,
      failure of a critical process, a major safety violation, is a repeat deficiency or requires
      higher headquarters involvement. A finding should point out what went wrong and the
      source of the problem. Evaluators shall cite the governing instruction/regulation. An
      OPR is required. If the 482 FW/CC is designated as the OPR, an OCR is also required.
      5.15.4. Recommended Improvement Area (RIA). An RIA is a weakness, observation,
      etc., not serious enough to be considered a finding.
      5.15.5. Grading Criteria. The five-tier rating system in AFI 90-201, Inspector General
      Inspection Activities will be used.
6. Self-Inspection Program (SIP).
   6.1. General Philosophy.
482FWI90-201 26 OCTOBER 2011                                                               33


     6.1.1. The purpose of the Self-Inspection Program is to identify and correct deficiencies
     before they become detrimental to mission accomplishment. To achieve this, the SIP
     highlights potential trouble areas for managerial attention before these areas become
     problems.
     6.1.2. The program is designed to be a user friendly tool conducive to quick, efficient,
     and accurate reviews by functional area managers and their commanders.
     6.1.3. A specific goal of this program is to give the Commander the status of wing‘s
     programs without generating excessive paperwork.
  6.2. Establishing the Self-inspection Program.
     6.2.1. The 482 FW/CC designates a Wing Self-Inspection Manager and alternate.
     6.2.2. Group commanders, squadron commanders and section chiefs will appoint
     functional area SIP managers to conduct the program within their organizations.
     6.2.3. Self-Inspection reports go through each level of supervision to the Group
     Commander. Group Commanders provide a statement of assurance of accomplishment
     of the annual Self Inspection to the 482 FW/CC, accompanied by a statement as to
     whether there are any discrepancies irresolvable at Group level.
  6.3. Dissemination of Information.
     6.3.1. Self- inspection subjects and checklists originate from a number of sources, as
     follows:
         6.3.1.1. All 482 FW functions required conducting self inspections or to identify,
         track and correct discrepancies will do so in Management Internal Control Tool
         (MICT). All functions will use the standard checklists provided in MICT; additional
         checklists may be created locally as required. Functional SIP managers must
         maintain their discrepancies in MICT.
         6.3.1.2. Any discrepancy not corrected within the one year period prior to the
         subsequent annual self inspection must be forwarded to the 482 FW/CC with an
         explanation of why it was not within the capacity of the Group to correct it [an
         example would be an issue awaiting Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) funding].
         6.3.1.3. Annual Statement of Assurance (SOA) of the completion of the Wing SI
         program is documented via an SOA included in the Management Control Program.
  6.4. Documentation.
     6.4.1. All Self Inspection Program Documentation will be maintained electronically in
     MICT; hard copies will be produced only as required.
  6.5. Conducting Self-Inspections:
     6.5.1. The self inspection report must be completed and received by that individual
     monitor‘s Group Staff self inspection monitor by Saturday of the regularly scheduled
     June Unit Training Assembly (UTA). Each Group staff will then forward a letter to the
     482 FW/Process Management Office (482 FW/CCO) or the 482 FW SI monitor advising
     of self inspection completion and delinquent functional areas. If a SI monitor‘s report
34                                                      482FWI90-201 26 OCTOBER 2011


     goes through several levels of supervision before reaching the using self- inspection
     monitor, the inspection may need to be initiated one or two months prior to the deadline.
     6.5.2. Review locally generated checklists and update, if necessary, each time a self-
     inspection is conducted. Identify problems/discrepancies in MICT and establish an
     estimated completion date estimated completion date (ECD). Take follow-up action to
     complete the correction not later than (NLT) the ECD. Updates [either closure or
     extension, with explanation of actions taken to date, actions required for completion, and
     new ECD] must be accomplished NLT the established ECD for each discrepancy.
     6.5.3. All discrepancies should be included in MICT. Supervisors/commanders will
     review subordinate reports. Not all open discrepancies need to be forwarded to the next
     level. Items which must be included are those beyond your capability to correct, those
     which cannot be corrected by the next scheduled self- inspection, those which require
     higher level assistance, and any which the supervisor wishes to forward.
