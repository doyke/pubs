OP-FE-75) and/or on the 48th Operations Group Stan/Eval ICE page at
https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/48OG/OGV/default.aspx. Upon completion, the letter will be kept in
the individual‘s gradebook. The signed Letter of Xs will be the source document for qualification.
When the SQ/CC has signed the Record of Operations Supervisor Training, the squadron training
officer (56 RQS/DOT, 492/3/4 FS/DOT) or squadron Stan/Eval (CCV) will annotate the Letter of Xs
with an ― X‖ to show the individual is qualified to perform Ops Sup duties (see AFI 11-202 Volume 2
Lakenheath Supplement, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, or waiver to accompany).
2.2.4. (Added-LAKENHEATH)           There are no Ops Sup currency requirements, but the
SQ/CC is responsible for monitoring the Ops Sups‘ performance and assessing their ability to
continue.
2.2.5. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The Ops Sup must have a minimum of 8-hours crew rest
prior to performing duties and the Ops Sup duty day will not exceed 16 hours. For duty periods
when there is no SOF on duty, Ops Sups will have 12-hours crew rest or duty day limits.
AFI11-418_LAKENHEATHSUP 14 JUNE 2012                                                            3


2.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH)           SDO. The SDO is an experienced aircrew member,
designated by the squadron DO, who has the authority to make operations-related decisions and
recommendations.
2.3.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The unit will devise an SDO training program and will track
SDO qualification (if necessary) on the squadron Letter of X.
2.3.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The SDO may be necessary when the squadron has on-
going off-station operations. These operations include sorties that do not otherwise qualify as
deployed sorties. When on duty, the SDO will be available to the OG/CC, the SOF, Command
and Control (C2) personnel and other supporting agencies to respond to squadron operations
issues. For operations where the SOF is not qualified to provide technical assistance to the type
of aircraft airborne and an Ops Sup is not readily available, the SDO will assist the SOF as
required. When an SDO is required, the SDO will provide contact procedures to the 48 FW
Command Post (48 FW/CP). The 48 FW/CP will have this information available for 48 OG/CC
(or designated representative) and the SOF. There are no crew rest requirements for the SDO.
2.4. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Duty Desk Officer (DDO). The 56 RQS DDO will be an
aircrew member qualified in their unit‘s aircraft and designated by the 56 RQS SQ/CC, tasked to
assist the Ops Sup.
2.4.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The 56 RQS Current Operations (DOC) is responsible for
establishing the DDO training program. At a minimum, the training will cover DDO procedures
and familiarization, and be conducted by a qualified DDO. This training will be documented on
a training checklist that will be placed in the member‘s training records. Upon certification, the
squadron DOT or CCV will track DDO qualification on the squadron Letter of X.
2.4.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) SQ/CCs may elect to use DDOs to man the duty desk and
assist the Ops Sup during daily flying operations at home station or at a deployed location.
However, the Ops Sup retains responsibility for all current operations-related decisions and will
be present for aircrew step briefs. The Ops Sup must be immediately available to handle these
time sensitive requirements during flying operations. The 56 RQS will utilize DDOs during all
helicopter flying operations. All daily operations and emergency procedure checklists will be
maintained at the 56 RQS duty desk. There are no crew rest or currency requirements for the
DDO.
3.1.5. (Added-LAKENHEATH)           Reduced Flying Operations. Operations, scheduled or
unscheduled, that occur when majority of the unit is not flying. Under these conditions, the
OG/CC may direct that the group-level SOF position is not required (N/R).
3.1.6. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Out of Local Area Operations. Missions that take off and
land at home base but operate outside the local area for extended periods of time. These
missions usually have primary emergency landing fields other than home base.
3.1.7. (Added-LAKENHEATH)                Deployment/Re-deployment. The departure from home
station to another location, or return to home station from another location.
3.1.8. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Cross-Country Departures/Returns. Aircraft departing from
or returning to home station for other than a deployment, exercise or contingency.

Notes:
1. The designated supervisor will be in the unit operations complex and can be immediately
   contacted or summoned by telephone, pager, radio or intercom.
2. For deployed operations, the detachment commander will coordinate with the host base OG
   for supervision requirements. This may involve integrating into the host base SOF and/or
   Ops Sup program.
3. The designated supervisor can be immediately reached by telephone, pager, radio or
   intercom.
4. For cross-country departures, Note 1 applies. For cross-country recoveries, Note 3 applies.
5. The designated supervisor will be in the unit operations complex until 45 minutes after
   departure and 45 minutes prior to arrival, and can be immediately contacted or summoned by
   telephone, pager, radio or intercom.
3.2. (LAKENHEATH)          The 48 OG/CC may impose additional requirements depending on
circumstances.
3.3. (LAKENHEATH) The primary means of contacting the unit Ops Sup is the telephone at
the unit duty desk. If the Ops Sup is not at the duty desk, the Ops Sup will ensure operations
center personnel know how he or she can be summoned. The primary means of contacting the
48 OG/CC (or designated representative) is the commander‘s hotline (or cell phone). If this
fails, the 48 FW/CP will be used to locate the 48 OG/CC (or designated representative). When
not in the office, the 48 OG/CC (or designated representative) will either provide the 48 FW/CP
a contact phone number or will maintain frequency modulation (FM) radio connectivity with the
48 FW/CP. The primary means of contacting the SOF is the telephone. The SOF also monitors
the command net on the FM radio, under the callsign RAMROD, and may contact any agency on
the FM net as the situation dictates.
4.3.1. (LAKENHEATH)         In addition to Table 1, the SOF will be on duty IAW Table 1.1.
AFI11-418_LAKENHEATHSUP 14 JUNE 2012                                                          5


4.3.3. (LAKENHEATH) The SOF reference library (located in the tower) contains the 48 FW
SOF Checklist and all pertinent regulations governing the supervision of operational flying at
RAF Lakenheath. The SOF will be familiar with the contents and use of the 48 FW SOF
Checklist.
4.3.4.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The SOF will report to 48th Operations Support Squadron
Airfield Management Flight (48 OSS/OSAA) for updates to NOTAMs and an airfield status
briefing (including at a minimum cable status, transients, exercises, real world movements, and
distinguished visitors) before reporting to the tower.             See Lakenheath Instruction
(LAKENHEATHI) 13-201, Air Traffic Control, Airfield Operations and Local Flying
Procedures.
4.3.4.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The SOF will report to the 48 OSS Weather Flight (48
OSS/OSW) for a weather briefing before reporting to the tower. For updated weather
information, coordinate with 48 OSS/OSW via the hotline, the SOF computer, or the Internet
based Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF). 48 OSS/OSW provides the current observation on
the Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) ICE page (reference the 48 FW SOF Checklist for the
link) and the local forecast on the TAF. The Mission Execution Forecast (MEF) forecast does
not supersede the forecast TAF, and is to be used for mission planning and winds and wave
assessments only. The MEF does provide links to the TAFs provided by the 21st Operational
Weather Squadron. See LAKENHEATHI 15-101, Weather Support.
4.3.4.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH)             The SOF can make a request for updated MU-meter
readings, Runway Surface Condition (RSC), and airfield sweepers from Airfield Management
(see LAKENHEATHI 13-201). The SOF will also coordinate with Airfield Management on
priority changes for snow removal/control based on aircraft launch/recovery locations. Note:
Snow removal priorities are outlined in 48 FW Plan 32-1002, Snow and Ice Control, and Airfield
Management is the approval authority for changing priorities.
4.3.4.4. (Added-LAKENHEATH) In order to help prevent low in-flight fuel issues from
occurring, in addition to the requirements in AFI 11-202 Volume 3, the SOF will give strong
consideration to declaring an alternate when the Visual Flight Rules (VFR) pattern is closed. If
the Charlie to Downwind entry procedure itself is closed, and no other portion of the VFR
pattern is affected, an alternate may not be required.
4.3.4.5. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Before commencing local flying operations, the SOF will
advise the 48 OG/CC (or designated representative) of expected runway, alternates, and any
other factors (such as winds and weather) that may affect flying. The SOF will pass the flying
status to the squadron duty desks and 48 FW/CP.
4.3.5. (LAKENHEATH) The SOF will continually monitor the Ultra High Frequency (UHF)
radio in the tower. A discrete UHF frequency (local channel 9) has been designated for SOF use.
UHF local channel 13 is designated as the Single Frequency Approach (SFA) and may be used
by Air Traffic Control (ATC), the aircrew, and the SOF during emergency recoveries. The SFA
is an ATC frequency and ATC approval is required before the SOF may transmit on it. ATC
includes: 48 OSS Airfield Operations Flight Radar Control (48 OSS/OSAR) and 48 OSS
Airfield Operations Flight Tower Control (48 OSS/OSAT). Coordination with ATC will
normally take place through the Tower Watch Supervisor. If direct contact with the Radar
Approach Control (RAPCON) Supervisor is more expedient, SOF will keep the Tower Watch
Supervisor informed of what is happening.

4.3.6.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) To the maximum extent possible, the SOF will check all
departing and arriving aircraft with the binoculars for proper gear configuration, landing lights
and flaps.
4.3.6.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Maintain vigilance and awareness of aircraft on 24 Victor
departures ensuring altitude restrictions are adhered to in order to alleviate any potential conflicts
with arrivals through Charlie. Maintain vigilance when the helicopter VFR pattern is open, the
fixed wing VFR pattern is closed, and Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) A approaches are in
effect in order to alleviate potential conflicts with helicopter Jolly East arrivals and departures
with fighters inbound on the TACAN A. If an impending conflict arises, advise the Tower
Watch Supervisor as soon as possible.
4.3.8. (LAKENHEATH) The SOF will contact squadron Ops Sups or (SDO) when severe
weather (convective activity, lightning strikes, or observed surface winds greater than 35 knots)
will impact departure and arrival corridors.
4.3.10. (LAKENHEATH)            The SOF Daily Activity Report will contain the following, as a
minimum:
4.3.10.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Blocks for: Date, SOF‘s rank and last name (up to six
changeovers), latest SOF Read File number, tour start time, tour stop time, Navigational Aid
(NAVAID), Instrument Landing System (ILS) and TACAN status, cable status, telephone status,
computer status, radio status, bird watch condition, alternate status (time, runway number, and
airfield), event narrative (time, call sign, aircraft type, tail number, type of event, termination
time), comments for the SOF program manager, extensions, waivers, administration, and the
closing SOF‘s original or digital signature.
4.3.10.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH)                The following are additional requirements for home
station operations (off station, as available): SOF links (wing/squadron flying schedule, base and
local area weather, applicable NOTAMS, and 21st Operational Weather Squadron), and
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) identifier list of 48 FW alternate and
emergency airfields.
4.3.10.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH)             In the event of in-flight fuel dumping, annotate the
approximate location, duration, and altitude of fuel dumping in the SOF tour report (see
paragraph 4.3.14.4), and then contact 48 FW Safety (48 FW/SE) to confirm fuel dumping did not
exceed environmental restrictions.
4.3.11. (LAKENHEATH) The SOF will keep the 48 OG/CC (or designated representative)
informed of significant changes to the daily flying plan. The SOF has access to the daily flying
schedule via the SOF computer. The SOF will not be responsible for inputting changes, takeoff
or land times into this database.
4.3.12. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The SOF will be a non-player during exercise operations,
and is exempt from chemical gear and ground crew ensemble requirements, and control tower
evacuations while performing SOF duties. Specifically, the SOF will not wear the gas mask,
helmet, or gloves during SOF duty. While en route to and from the tower, the SOF may be
required to dress in appropriate Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) until arrival in the
tower at the discretion of the 48 FW Commander. The SOF will not compromise crew rest or
changeover time to respond to Alarm conditions.
AFI11-418_LAKENHEATHSUP 14 JUNE 2012                                                            7


4.3.12.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) If an ATC Liaison is required, the SOF will coordinate
closely, as time permits, with both the Mission Director and ATC Liaison for operations that
affect or are affected by the exercise. The SOF will provide inputs that affect arrival and
departure sequencing.
4.3.12.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The SOF will coordinate all real world operational issues
with the Tower and RAPCON Watch Supervisors. The SOF has the authority to call an exercise
―Terminate‖ if safety of flight is compromised or in question.
4.3.13. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Sign-off each SOF Read File in the front section of the
Read File. SOF tours are logged through the SOF‘s squadron tracking system.
4.3.14. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The opening SOF will:
4.3.14.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH)             Call 48 OG/OGV to see if anything is needed in the
tower.
4.3.14.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Arrive at 48 OSS/OSAA 90 minutes prior to the first
scheduled takeoff time to start the 48 FW SOF Checklist opening procedures. This time should
be increased to 120 minutes if bad weather, ice, or snow is anticipated (see paragraph 6.2.3.1).
4.3.14.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Receive an airfield status briefing from 48 OSS/OSAA
and pick up the daily flying schedule, latest NOTAMs, Flight Information Publication (FLIP)
updates, and the SOF clipboard. Following the 48 OSS/OSAA briefing, the SOF will proceed to
48 OSS/OSW for a weather briefing.
4.3.14.4. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Begin a SOF Daily Activity Report using the electronic
log located on the 48 OG/OGV website or a paper equivalent in the format defined in paragraph
4.3.10.
4.3.15. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Prior to reporting to the tower for SOF changeover, the
oncoming SOF will call the on-duty SOF and 48 OG/OGV to see if anything is needed in the
tower, and visit 48 OSS/OSA and 48 OSS/OSW for face-to-face briefings.
4.3.16. (Added-LAKENHEATH) When night flying is conducted, the mid-period SOF is
responsible for obtaining and disseminating alternate airfield hours and status. If there are only
two SOFs scheduled during the flying window, the opening SOF will obtain alternate airfield
hours and status to pass to squadron Ops Sups and the closing SOF. Procedures are outlined in
the 48 FW SOF Checklist.
4.3.17. (Added-LAKENHEATH)            After the last engine shut down, the closing SOF,
referencing the 48 FW SOF Checklist, will:
4.3.17.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Inform the 48 FW/CP of termination of local fixed wing
flying. Once all flying is terminated early, the SOF or 56 RQS Ops Sup will ensure 48 FW/CP
notifies affected agencies. As a minimum, this includes: 48 OSS/OSAA, 48 OSS/OSW, 48th
Civil Engineering Squadron Fire Protection Flight (48 CES/CEF), 48 FW/SE, and affected air
refueling units.
4.3.17.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The SOF will complete the SOF Daily Activity Report
and route it electronically to the distribution list contained in the 48 FW SOF Checklist. The
SOF Program Manager will retain completed SOF Daily Activity Reports for one year.

4.3.17.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH)             The KVL-3000 (FM Brick) is re-keyed on the first
Tuesday (or next duty day if a holiday) of the new quarter (January, April, July, October). On
the first Monday of the new quarter, the closing SOF will leave the FM Brick and a note on the
clipboard at 48 OSS/OSAA (base operations) for the next duty SOF to have the FM Brick re-
keyed. The SOF scheduled on the re-key date will take the FM Brick to the 48th
Communications Squadron (48 CS) for re-keying. The SOF will implement the new key when
all of the commanders‘ FM Bricks are also re-keyed, usually at approximately 1300L.
4.3.18. (Added-LAKENHEATH) When flight operations are conducted during Protective
Aircraft Shelter (PAS) vault operations, the SOF will adjust pattern procedures so as not to over-
fly the PAS location. If required, the SOF will direct straight-in recoveries and full stop
landings.
4.4.5.1. (LAKENHEATH) Ensure the SOF is notified of all SQ/CC approved sorties that are
planning to make touch-and-go landings. This is not applicable for HH-60G local flying

4.4.7.5.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Ensure aircrew are briefed on: specific takeoff, landing
data, local area flying considerations, weather, alternate, local bird watch condition, divert fuel
required, aircraft status, royal flights, and NOTAM updates.
4.4.7.5.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH)              In addition, ensure aircrews are briefed on any
significant weather affecting departure or arrival by radio on the squadron operations frequency
before departure and on recovery.
4.4.8. (LAKENHEATH) For missions where a SOF is not required, this log will be prepared
by Ops Sup or SDO. Log format and content will be defined by the SQ/CC (or designated
representative). Squadrons may establish a template to define content and format. Note:
Mission commanders/flight leads are required to coordinate with Ops Sup/Top 3 prior to the
flight brief when intended sortie type, profile, airspace, and/or aircraft configuration do not
match the approved schedule.

AFI11-418_LAKENHEATHSUP 14 JUNE 2012                                                             9


4.5.4.1.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Notify the SOF of any emergency, accident or incident
that is reported by any aircraft or agency.
4.5.4.1.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH)             Assist the SOF by expeditiously relaying messages
(aircraft recall, change of alternate, aircraft accountability, aircraft diversions, and runway
closure) to airborne 48 FW aircraft through the RAF Lakenheath Tower, RAPCON, and other
agencies as required by the SOF. The 48 FW/CP will advise the SOF when all airborne 48 FW
aircraft are in receipt of the message or will pass information on aircraft that could not be
reached.
4.5.4.1.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH) If required by the SOF, call and book airfields for use as
alternates by 48 FW aircraft. Airfield contact information is available in the 48 FW SOF Checklist.
The 48 FW SOF Checklist is maintained on the 48 OG Stan/Eval Division CoP at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-OP-FE-75) and/or on the 48th
Operations Group Stan/Eval ICE page at https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/48OG/OGV/default.aspx.)
The SOF must be informed if there is a limit on the number of aircraft the alternate will or can
accept.
4.5.4.1.4. (Added-LAKENHEATH)              Advise the SOF of transient aircraft who require
assistance.
4.5.5. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The 48 OSS/OSAA section will:
4.5.5.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH)            Relay information passed from alternate air bases to the
SOF in a timely manner.
4.5.5.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) If the opening SOF has not arrived 60 minutes prior to the
first fixed wing takeoff, 48 OSS/OSAT will contact the SOF‘s squadron. The SOF‘s squadron
will then locate the SOF or expedite a replacement to the tower.
4.5.5.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH)              Perform the airfield inspection.    The inspection will
include runway, taxiways, barriers, and lighting.
4.5.5.4. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Notify the SOF of scheduled PAS vault operations to
include location(s), scheduled start and stop times, actual start time, and actual completion time.
5.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH)             During abnormal or emergency situations, the SOF/56 RQS
Ops Sup will:
5.2.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Notify the Tower Watch Supervisor as soon as possible. As
time permits, notify the 48 OG/CC (or designated representative) and the affected squadron Ops
Sup (or SOF if 56 RQS) of any emergency situation, accident, or significant incident that is
reported by an aircraft or agency. Notification should primarily be via telephone hotline. The
back-up notification method will be via FM or UHF radio.
5.2.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Comply with the 48 FW SOF Checklist and coordinate with
London Military (Mil) Distress and Diversion (D&D) Cell for the relay of messages to aircrew
on Guard and through the RAF Lakenheath Tower, RAPCON, London Mil, Ground Controlled
Intercept (GCI), 48 FW/CP and or other similar agencies (as required) to ensure time critical
information is passed to all 48 FW aircraft. Time permitting; the SOF should talk directly to as
many agencies as required to ensure 100 percent aircrew notification of messages critical to
safety of flight or recovery (runway closures, new alternate requirements, change of alternate
which requires additional recovery fuel, real world alarm conditions, aircraft recalls, etc.)
 10                                          AFI11-418_LAKENHEATHSUP 14 JUNE 2012


5.2.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Be the coordination authority for divert decisions. Time
and situation permitting, the SOF will inform the squadron Ops Sup(s) of intentions to divert
aircraft, recall aircraft, or there is a potential runway closure. The SOF will then inform the 48
OG/CC (or designated representative), 48 FW/CP and 48 FW Advanced Plans (48 FW/AP) (for
fighters) to pass details about the aircraft that divert.
5.2.4. (Added-LAKENHEATH)           Inform the host squadron when off-station aircraft are
diverting into RAF Lakenheath, and notify 48 FW/CP if any distinguished visitor aircrew are on
board.
5.2.5. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Coordinate with ATC personnel when the airfield or flying
status has changed to ensure the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) reflects the
new information.
6.1.2.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The SOF will not direct ATC to provide services other
than those outlined in ATC directives. This does not preclude the SOF from injecting
operational preferences or suggestions through the Tower Watch Supervisor. The SOF will only
use ATC frequencies after coordinating with the controlling agency, unless an unsafe situation
could immediately jeopardize safety. If a SOF commandeers an ATC frequency, he or she
assumes aircraft separation responsibility until coordinated with and re-assumed by the Watch
Supervisor.
6.1.2.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The 56 RQS Ops Sup or DDO may transmit to distressed
HH-60G aircrew without prior coordination with the SOF.
6.2.2. (LAKENHEATH) The maximum amount of time SOFs can be in the control tour is 8
hours. The 48 OG/CC (or designated representative) can waive this for surges, exercises, or
higher headquarter tasking. SOFs are required to have 48-hours crew rest prior to performing
SOF duty after crossing four or more time zones within a 24-hour period, IAW AFI 11-202
Volume 3. When night operations (not including civil twilight) are conducted, the SOF
maximum duty day is 10 hours.
6.2.3.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The SOF will be in the primary duty location 60 minutes
prior to the first scheduled takeoff (see Tables 1 and 1.1, and paragraph 4.3.14.2).
6.2.3.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) After coordination with the Tower Watch Supervisor, the
RAPCON Supervisor, 48 OSS/OSAA, 48 OSS/OSW, and 48 CES/CEF, the SOF or the 56 RQS
Ops Sup may request one 30-minute extension to the scheduled flying period. All extensions
require 48 OG/CC (or designated representative) approval. Extensions beyond 30 minutes may
be considered under special circumstances. All extensions must be documented on the SOF
Daily Activity Report, and the requester will ensure the 48 FW/CP is verbally notified. When
applicable, if a squadron extends flying operations more than 30 minutes outside the scheduled
flying window, that squadron will supply a replacement SOF. Additionally, any squadron with
off-station returns or departures outside the scheduled flying window will be responsible for
supplying a SOF.
6.3.1. (LAKENHEATH) When any local fighter activity is in progress, the primary duty
location of the SOF is the control tower. This includes local sorties flown by units deployed to
RAF Lakenheath. See paragraph Table 1.1 for the SOF duty locations during FCFs. Local
fighter aircraft will not be allowed to takeoff until a SOF is in position. The SOF will be in the
primary duty location IAW Table 1 and Table 1.1. For departures, the SOF will remain in the
AFI11-418_LAKENHEATHSUP 14 JUNE 2012                                                            11


tower for a minimum of 15 minutes after the last takeoff. For recoveries, the SOF will be in the
tower not later than 30 minutes prior to the proposed land time.
6.3.2. (LAKENHEATH) The alternate duty location is the SOF vehicle or squadron operations
duty desk. When no local fighter aircraft are airborne or scheduled to be for at least 45 minutes,
the SOF is not required to be in the tower. If not in the tower, the SOF will maintain contact
with the 48 FW/CP via the FM radio. The SOF must return to the tower not later than 35
minutes prior to the next scheduled takeoff. Note: RAF Lakenheath does not have an alternate
tower location, so, the airfield will close if the tower is evacuated. In this case, the SOF should
proceed to the SOF vehicle (48 OSS/OSAA maintains the keys) and provide assistance to
diverting aircraft. The SOF should expect to contact 48 OSS/OSW over the command net on the
FM radio if the tower is evacuated or the phone lines fail.
6.4.1.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH)           The SOF primary duty location should have as a
minimum radio equipment required to communicate with airborne aircraft, the command and
control network, and monitor ATC frequencies.
6.4.3. (LAKENHEATH) 48 OSS/OSAA holds the SOF vehicle keys. The SOF vehicle
contains only an UHF radio and binoculars. For this reason, the SOF should supplement the
vehicle‘s equipment with the SOF‘s FM radio, additional binoculars or any other equipment, as
required.
6.4.6. (LAKENHEATH) An alternate SOF kit (brief case containing required regulations,
checklists, guides, and technical orders for performing SOF duties) will be maintained by 48
OG/OGV and is available upon request by the SOF.
6.4.8. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The SOF will take actions necessary to maintain the SOF
equipment. Long-term discrepancies should be immediately communicated to 48 OG/OGV via a
phone call, and if not fixed, documented in the SOF Discrepancy File. All communication
discrepancies must be worked with the Tower Watch Supervisor‘s assistance and work orders
must be obtained from the 48 CS Maintenance Job Control Section (48 CS/SCMJ). Supply
shortages should be corrected by coordination with the oncoming SOF. If this is not feasible,
contact 48 OG/OGV for assistance.
6.5.1.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The 48 OG/CC may grant verbal approval for non-
CMR/BMC to perform SOF duties.
6.5.1.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) All SOFs must have at least 6 months on station in the F-
15C/E. If previously SOF qualified, these requirements are reduced to 60 days on station and F-
15C/E currency.
6.5.1.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The 48 OG/CC will approve all nominees prior to entry into
the upgrade program and is the qualification authority following completion of training. The master
nomination letter is maintained on the 48 OG Stan/Eval Division CoP at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-OP-FE-75) and/or on the
