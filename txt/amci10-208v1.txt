                                           Chapter 1

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This directive:
     1.1.1. Defines the basic structure and authority of the AMC Crisis Action Team (CAT) and
     supporting organizations.
     1.1.2. Details the lines of communication between the HQ AMC Staff, AMC CAT, 18 AF
     (AFTRANS), 618 Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC), and 618 TACC Contingency
     Response Cell (CRC).
1.2. General.
     1.2.1. Crisis, contingency, exercise, and wartime operations require continuous HQ AMC
     attention and timely response to both internal and external taskings, including tasks from
     USTRANSCOM, HQ USAF, 18 AF (AFTRANS), and 618 TACC. The CAT provides the
     AMC Commander (AMC/CC) with a corporate approach to time-sensitive operations and a
     flexible support staff tailored to meet worldwide air mobility requirements during times of
     crisis. The AMC CAT provides a graduated crisis response capability and the ability for the
     AMC staff to quickly respond to contingency taskings.
     1.2.2. The AMC Vice Commander (AMC/CV) convenes the CAT to direct a concentrated
     effort by the AMC staff to support crisis action planning and plan execution.
     1.2.3. The CAT, through its support staff and functional action officers, ensures 24-hour-a-
     day availability of designated functional expertise. During a contingency, the CAT's
     functional and support staff may be reduced and placed on stand-by as operations dictate at
     the direction of the Primary CAT Director, following approval by AMC/A3.
     1.2.4. The CAT will support AMC/CC and 18 AF (AFTRANS)/CC, as required.
     1.2.5. The AMC CAT will provide a CAT Liaison Officer (LNO) to the 618 TACC CRC to
     act as the CAT Director’s representative to facilitate communication and coordination.
     1.2.6. To speed coordination and ensure responsiveness to taskers, responses prepared by
     Directorate and Special Staff Agency (SSA) representatives in the CAT (CAT Action
     Officers) are considered to be the official Directorate or SSA position. Directorates and
     SSAs must ensure their processes during contingency operations account for this pre-
     coordination requirement.

                                           Chapter 2

                                            POLICY

2.1. General. Circumstances which may require AMC/CV to direct CAT activation include, but
are not limited to:
   2.1.1. Operations Plan (OPLAN) and Concept Plan (CONPLAN) implementation;
   2.1.2. Natural disasters;
   2.1.3. Major peacetime accidents;
   2.1.4. Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) exercises;
   2.1.5. Homeland Defense responses;
   2.1.6. Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).
2.2. Structure.
   2.2.1. The CAT consists of designated representatives from each headquarters functional
   area. As directed by the CAT Director, this group works time-sensitive issues required to
   support air mobility operations.
   2.2.2. The CAT Director manages the CAT Director Staff and CAT Action Officers on
   behalf of AMC/CV. The CAT Director oversees functional integration and expedites staff
   work required to support the contingency or crisis by coordinating taskings/requirements
   with the AMC staff, 18 AF (AFTRANS), and 618 TACC.
   2.2.3. The CAT Director's primary 618 TACC contact is the 618 TACC/CV (Figure 2.1).
   The TACC/CV will provide the single response for TACC to the AMC CAT regarding
   external taskings.

2.3. Composition and Sourcing.
     2.3.1. Representatives from all Directorates and SSAs will be tasked for CAT duties. CAT
     staffing is determined by the situation; the goal is to use the minimum staffing required to
     meet contingency requirements. The SIPRNET and NIPRNET will be used as the medium
     to distribute CAT taskings to the various staff agencies.
     2.3.2. CAT Director Senior Staff. The CAT Director Senior Staff (CAT Director, Deputy
     Director, Executive Officer, and NCO/Admin) provides a core cadre of personnel qualified to
     perform CAT duties when the CAT is activated. Additional personnel may be trained and
     used as the length of the contingency/crisis dictates. Once a person is trained for a Senior
     Staff position, this individual remains in the CAT duty “pool” for a minimum of one year or
     until a replacement is trained. Only fully trained personnel with access to classified, GCCS,
     GDSS, and Logbook will serve on the CAT. Establishing the necessary accounts requires
     specific security paperwork that cannot be accomplished on short notice.
        2.3.2.1. Government civilian employees of similar grade and experience as their military
        counterparts can serve on the AMC CAT. Civilians serving on the CAT must be
        approved by their Directorate or SSA, followed by appropriate coordination with civilian
        personnel flight for duties assigned, if necessary.

                                      PROCEDURES

4.1. CAT Activation.
   4.1.1. AMC/CV directs CAT activation through the AMC Command Center and the
   AMC/A3 (see Figure 4.1). The AMC Command Center notifies the CAT Director Staff,
   AMC Directors, and SG. Remaining SSA Chiefs will be notified by their CAT Action
   Officers.
   4.1.2. After activation, the composition of the CAT is determined by the Primary CAT
   Director based on the size and scope of the crisis. The Primary CAT Director will then
   coordinate with the CAT Manager to notify the CAT Action Officers required for duty.
       4.1.2.1. During normal duty hours, the CAT Manager will notify the Directorate CAT
       POCs, who will notify their CAT Action Officer.
       4.1.2.2. After normal duty hours, the CAT Manager will notify CAT Action Officers
       using the Directorate CAT POC monthly battle roster and/or the information in the
       Logbook sign in/out log.
   4.1.3. Once notified, members assigned to CAT duty must report for duty as soon as
   possible, but NLT 1 hour after notification.
4.2. Recall Rosters.
   4.2.1. Each week, the CAT Manager will provide the CAT Director Senior Staff on-call
   roster to AMC Command Center, 618 TACC/XOZ, 618 TACC/XOZX, 618 TACC/XOC,
   AMC/CVE, AMC/DS, 18AF/CCE, 18 AF/CS, and AMC/A3E.
   4.2.2. Directorate CAT POCs are responsible for ensuring their roster of qualified CAT
   Action Officers remains current (Logbook sign in-out log) and will notify the CAT Manager
   of any changes. Directorate CAT POCs will also battle roster “on-call” CAT Action Officers
   each month and provide a roster to the CAT Manager by the last duty day of each month.
4.3. CAT Deactivation. The AMC/CV directs deactivation of the CAT.
   4.3.1. All SITREP messages regarding Contingency Response Elements (CREs) will be sent
   directly to AMC/A3M during times when the CAT is in inactive status.
   4.3.2. All on-call CAT Director Staff and CAT Action Officers will enter their contact
   information into the Logbook sign-in/sign-out log at the beginning of their on-call period.

4.4. Tasking Procedures.
   4.4.1. USTRANSCOM normally uses classified Logbook to task AMC during crisis
   operations. HQ USAF normally uses classified e-mail to task AMC. During natural
   disasters, NIPRNET tends to be the primary means of communication.
   4.4.2. Active CAT. The CAT Director will normally task out all crisis-related taskings and
   other time sensitive (due in 3 days or less) taskings related to crisis/contingency operations
   received in the CAT Director’s organizational e-mail account, by message, or via Logbook.
   The CAT Director will send all other taskers to AMC/CCEE for tasking to the AMC Staff.
   4.4.3. Inactive CAT. AMC/A3X will task out time-sensitive (due in 3 days or less) taskings
   related to OCO, other contingencies, or homeland defense received in the CAT Directors
   organizational e-mail account, by message, or via Logbook. AMC/A3X will ensure
   responses to USTRANSCOM and HQ USAF are provided in Logbook or via e-mail. A3X
   will send all other taskers to AMC/CCEE for tasking to the AMC Staff.

4.5. Message Handling. During crisis operations when the CAT is activated, the CAT
Administrative Support staff ensures message traffic pertaining to a contingency or exercise
receives priority handling and delivery. The CAT is the focal point for messages to and from the
HQ AMC staff on matters relating to the crisis, contingency, war, or exercise. All outgoing
messages created by HQ AMC staff agencies relating to such situations should be released by the
CAT Director. These messages are retained locally accordingly to Air Force RDS (https://
www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm). Messages received during exercises will be
retained locally for a period of two years and then deleted from the message database.

                                   ADMINISTRATION

5.1. Training. Maximum CAT effectiveness results from thorough systems and procedures
training prior to CAT activation.
   5.1.1. Minimum training requirements vary by position, but include general training and
   orientation to the CAT, specific training on CAT systems and procedures, and continuation
   training to include participation in CAT training events and exercises.
      5.1.1.1. Directorate CAT POCs are responsible for developing training plans tailored to
      their CAT Action Officer’s participation in the CAT. Coordinate training requirements
      and scheduling with the CAT Manager.
      5.1.1.2. Certification
          5.1.1.2.1. CAT Director Certification. The Primary CAT Director will certify CAT
          Director training and qualification. The CAT Manager will maintain CAT Senior
          Staff training documentation.
          5.1.1.2.2. CAT Action Officer Certification. The Directorate CAT POC will certify
          CAT Action Officer training and qualification and will maintain training
          documentation.
5.2. Scheduling.
   5.2.1. When the CAT is activated, the Primary CAT Director will determine the CAT
   Director Staff work schedule. Normally, there will be two 12-hour shifts per day with an
   appropriate overlap to allow for continuity and proper turnover of information. Directorate
   CAT POCs will determine the work schedule for their respective CAT Action Officers.
   These schedules will be posted in Logbook and in the CAT, when activated.
   5.2.2. When the CAT is deactivated, a Directorate and SSA CAT Action Officer on-call
   schedule will be posted in Logbook (sign in/out roster) until CAT support operations are no
   longer required for the current crisis. The schedule must reflect 24/7 on-call coverage.
   5.2.3. The CAT Managers will create and manage the CAT Senior Staff and A3 CAT Action
   Officer schedules. Remaining Directorate CAT POCs will ensure proper CAT Action
   Officer coverage.
   5.2.4. All individuals identified for CAT duty will enter their contact information into the
   Logbook sign-in/sign-out log upon arriving for duty shifts.
5.3. Computer Accounts.
   5.3.1. Each Directorate and SSA will appoint a CAT Unit Program Account Manager
   (UPAM) and security manager. These positions may be filled by different individuals.

  5.3.2. Account and security managers use the GDSS Account Information Management
  System (AIMS) to obtain GDSS/ accounts. Security managers should verify CAT member’s
  security clearance information and requirement for access to a computer system in Joint
  Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS).
  5.3.3. The CAT Managers will coordinate any other system accounts that may be required.
