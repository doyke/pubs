Section B—Managing Personal Wireless Communication Systems

4. Managing Personal Wireless Communication Systems (PWCS) .
    4.1. Wireless Service. User centric wireless services are inherently non-core services, unless the wire-
    less service is mandated “core” by MAJCOM or higher authority (e.g., the decision to migrate an
    entire wing/base Land Mobile Radio (LMR) system to a trunked infrastructure requires both MAJ-
    COM and National Telecommunications and Information Administration [NTIA] approval prior to
    implementation). Wing/Base responsibility for providing core wireless services is normally limited to
    the infrastructure items required to operate the system. Funding responsibility for acquisition, opera-
    tion and maintenance of individual mobile wireless devices (e.g., hand carried or vehicular) normally
    remains with the requiring/using organization. Prior to funding, authorization to use government fre-
    quencies must be obtained through the Spectrum Certification Process in accordance with AFMAN
    33-120, Radio Frequency (RF) Spectrum Management. NOTE: Federal Communications Commis-
    sion (FCC) Code of Federal Government Regulations, Title 47, Part 15, devices are not governed by
    this AFI.
    4.1. (USAFE) Refer to AFI 33-116, Long-Haul Telecommunications Management, for guidance on
    satellite phones (e.g. INMARSAT). Refer to AFI 33-209 for guidance Secure Global System for
    Mobile Communications (secure cellular phones) and Iridium satellite phones.
    4.2. The HQ USAF/SCMN is the Air Force focal point for developing PWCS policy.
    4.3. HQ AFCA/GCLV:
       4.3.1. Is the day-to-day Air Force PWCS Manager.
       4.3.2. Provides the Air Force a single point of contact for HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, vendors, and
       other parties to improve PWCS support and formulate policy changes for HQ USAF review and
       approval.
       4.3.3. Monitors PWCS technological advances and changes to identify the types of PWCS that
       best satisfies Air Force wartime and peacetime operational mission requirements. Evaluates prac-
       tical improvements in PWCS support that enhance operational mission performance, offer signif-
       icant savings in personnel or operating costs, and/or provide other benefits.
       4.3.4. Reviews MAJCOM provided audit information, identifies patterns and trends with Air
       Force-wide applicability, and crossfeeds that information to all MAJCOMs.
AFI33-106_USAFESUP1_I 29 DECEMBER 2003                                                               7


     4.3.5. Manages the Air Force PWCS inventory Tracking and Reporting software (TRS). HQ
     AFCA/GCLV must review and approve all proposed software upgrades and/or modifications prior
     to their implementation.
  4.4. MAJCOMs:
     4.4.1. Appoint a command-level PWCS manager. Send the name, rank, Defense Switched Net-
     work number, and e-mail address to HQ AFCA/GCLV within 15 days of their appointment.
     4.4.1. (USAFE) The USAFE PWCS manager is in Ground Radio Systems Section, Mission Sys-
     tems Branch (HQ USAFE/SCNM).
     4.4.2. MAJCOM’s with bases located within the United States and Possessions (US&P) must
     comply with the NTIA narrowband mandates through acquisition of narrowband capable equip-
     ment and/or alternative communications services, or by obtaining the required waivers prior to the
     effective dates.
        4.4.2.1. After 1 January 2005, all Federal-owned/leased LMR systems in the 162-174 mega-
        hertz (MHz) band, operating within the US&P, must conform to the narrowband standards
        listed in the NTIA Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Man-
        agement. The effective date for the 138-150.8 and 406.1-420 MHz bands to conform to the
        NTIA narrowband standards is 1 January 2008. Do not use wideband equipment operating in
        these bands within the US&P after these dates without first obtaining a location-specific
        waiver from the NTIA.
     4.4.3. MAJCOM PWCS and Spectrum Managers should coordinate their activities to ensure
     compliance with the LMR narrowbanding mandates of any sovereign nations hosting U.S. Forces.
     4.4.4. Prepare supplements to this instruction, if needed, to accommodate MAJCOM unique
     operational, procedural and/or policy requirements.
  4.5. MAJCOM PWCS Managers:

          4.7.2.2. Requirement Processing and Risk Certification.
             4.7.2.2.1. If the using organization identifies a functional requirement to communicate
             sensitive unclassified or classified information, a completed operations security (OPSEC)
             analysis document and certification of risk acceptability (see AFI 10-1101, Operations
             Security) must accompany the original Requirements Document.
             4.7.2.2.2. Duplicate OPSEC analysis and certification of risk acceptability documents

            specialized mobile radio (ESMR)/wireless personal digital assistant (PDA) requirements
            and any associated OPSEC analysis and certification of risk acceptability documents
            should be reviewed and recertified annually by the requiring organization commander, the
            Wing/Base OPSEC manager, and the CSO.
            4.7.2.2.6. If the annual review indicates that the functional requirement remains
            unchanged while the level of risk has increased, but not beyond an acceptable level, pre-
            pare a revised OPSEC analysis and include it with the original document package.
            4.7.2.2.7. If the annual review indicates that the functional requirement remains
            unchanged, but the risk is no longer acceptable without encryption and a National Security
            Agency (NSA)-approved encryption device cannot be obtained, the using organization
            should discontinue using the noncompliant device until an appropriate device can be
            acquired.

     munications Security [COMSEC].)
        4.7.4.1. Coordinates all technical solutions for COMSEC-equipped PWCS devices with the
        wing/base COMSEC account manager and the requiring/owning unit COMSEC Responsible
        Officer (CRO). The COMSEC account manager and CROs acquire and manage COMSEC
        materials needed for PWCS devices containing NSA-approved encryption modules and pro-
        vide COMSEC training to users. See AFKAG-1, (FOUO) Air Force Communications Security
        (COMSEC) Operations, AFI 33-201, AFI 33-211, Communications Security (COMSEC) User
        Requirements, and AFI 33-230, Information Protection Assessment and Assistance Program,
        for guidance.
        4.7.4.2. Verifies TRS reportable, COMSEC-equipped, wing/base PWCS assets are being
        maintained according to AFI 21-109, Communications Security (COMSEC) Equipment Main-
        tenance and Maintenance Training; AFSSI 4001, Controlled Cryptographic Items; and FSAL/
        National Telecommunications Information System Security Instruction (NTISSI) 3005, Safe-
        guarding and Control of Data Encryption Standard (DES) Equipment and Associated Unclas-
        sified Communications Security Aids.
        4.7.4.3. For specific guidance on COMSEC issues relating to wireless operations outside the
        US&P, contact the appropriate MAJCOM Information Assurance authority. If interoperability
        with any host nation is required, at either the Unclassified or Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU)
        level, Air Force units may use wireless equipment provided by that host nation, if the appro-
        priate MAJCOM information protection authority approves the requirement and the host
        nations technical solution.
     4.7.5. Verifies all TRS reportable, COMSEC-equipped, PWCS devices are zeroized or the
     encryption module removed prior to turning them over to an authorized maintenance contractor
     for repair or turn in to base supply for disposal.
AFI33-106_USAFESUP1_I 29 DECEMBER 2003                                                               11


     4.7.6. Makes sure of complete demilitarization of all TRS reportable PWCS devices before being
     turned in to supply for disposal. Remove unit designations, call signs, operational procedures,
     codes, controlled cryptographic item (CCI) devices, frequency crystals, and other information that
     might compromise military operations. Reset frequencies and codes to default or generic settings
     in programmable radios.
        4.7.6.1. Place the following statement, signed by the wing/base PWCS manager, on the DD
        Form 1577, Unserviceable (Condemned) Tag-Materiel, “Per DoD Manual 4160.21-M-1, I cer-
        tify that demilitarization has been accomplished. Material is saleable-quality scrap.” Excess
        channel elements or other parts may be retained for future use or turned in according to
        AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 13, Standard Base Supply Customer’s Procedures.
     4.7.7. When the most appropriate technical solution for a base-wide, non-deployable communica-
     tions mission is a new Trunked LMR (TLMR) system, the PWCS manager assists the installation
     Spectrum manager in preparing a TLMR conversion plan for the new TLMR requirements. The
     format used for this plan is in the NTIA Manual (for requirements within the US&P). TLMR
     requirements identified outside the US&P use the guidelines provided under the applicable host
     nation agreement.
        4.7.7.1. In either case, coordinate the proposed technical solution with the installation spec-
        trum manager. Process a formal application for authorization to migrate to a TLMR system
        through the MAJCOM Spectrum Management Office and the Air Force Frequency Manage-
        ment Agency (AFFMA). Either the NTIA Spectrum Management Office (within the US&P),
        or the host nation spectrum management authority must approve the application before acquir-
        ing any TLMR equipment.
        4.7.7.2. Once a TLMR system has been installed on a base located in the US&P, submit an
        annual TLMR usage report through the MAJCOM Spectrum Management Office, in accor-
        dance with the guidelines provided in the NTIA Manual.
     4.7.8. Coordinates PWCS technical solutions with the Installation Spectrum Manager as needed.
        4.7.8.1. Coordinates all third party requests for temporary or permanent unit talk group fre-
        quency access with the installation Spectrum manager and the using unit PWCS manager.
        4.7.8.2. Obtain host nation spectrum assignments/coordination prior to PWCS deployment.
        Allow for lead-time constraints in accordance with AFI 33-118, Radio Frequency Spectrum
        Management.
     4.7.9. Refers requirements calling for the use of intrinsically safe LMR (ISLMR) equipment to
     the Base Fire Marshall and Base Safety office for processing through command safety channels.
     The command safety office determines the validity of the requirement and authorizes local acqui-
     sition.
     4.7.9. (USAFE) The Base Safety Staff and Base Fire Marshal will coordinate with the Command
     Safety Staff and Command Fire Marshal on all purchase and use of ISLMRs. The Command
     Safety Office and Command Fire Marshal must closely scrutinize requirements for ISLMRs and
     approve only those assets deemed as mission essential (i.e. required by AFI, AFOSH Standards,
     Fire Protection directives, and command directives). ISLMRs have stringent inspection, mainte-
     nance, certification, and recertification requirements. The inspection and maintenance tails impact
     the base LMR maintenance contract. The Command Safety Office and Command Fire Marshal
12                                               AFI33-106_USAFESUP1_I 29 DECEMBER 2003


     will cite the applicable reference or directive on the approved AF 3215, IT/NSS Requirements
     Document and forward a copy to the Base CSO/PWCS Manager.
        4.7.9.1. PWCS managers may participate in the development of local ISLMR operational pro-
        cedures with the base safety office when necessary.
        4.7.9.1. (USAFE) Comply with manufacturer inspection intervals as specified in equipment
        technical manual. Turn in equipment to IS certified contractor service center or manufacturer
        Factory Mutual (FM) depot. The PWCS managers will use the LMR Tracking and Reporting
        System to document inspections and maintenance on ISLMR.
        4.7.9.2. (Added-USAFE) Potential use of ISLMRs includes work in hazardous locations such
        as confined spaces and near flammable fuels, chemicals, and explosive atmospheres. When
        initially developed and during annual reviews, Master Entry Plans (MEP) will address (if
        known), the use of ISLMRs within confined spaces. If ISLMRs are not included on the MEPs,
        and it is later determined that ISLMRs will need to be used within confined spaces, then the
        use of ISLMRs in confined spaces must first be coordinated with the installation Confined
        Space Program Team before they are used in confined spaces.
        4.7.9.3. (Added-USAFE) When an ISLMR is sent in for maintenance, it must be serviced by
        a manufacturer FM certified service center to maintain its Intrinsically Safe (IS) certification.
        ISLMR will be sent in for maintenance if the case is cracked, IS certification is compromised,
        or if the radio has been tampered with.
        4.7.9.4. (Added-USAFE) Local LMR maintenance contractors must receive IS certification
        from the manufacturer. If the contractor is not IS certified, the ISLMR must be sent to the man-
        ufacturer FM depot to maintain its IS certification.
        4.7.9.5. (Added-USAFE) Users/managers may replace ISLMR accessory (i.e. batteries and
        antennas) provided they are replaced with like-IS accessory (i.e. IS batteries, IS antennas).
     4.7.10. Uses the current version of the TRS to manage reportable PWCS assets (include assets
     assigned to host, tenant, and geographically separated units). Ensure only authorized equip-
     ment-type standard designators (see Attachment 4, Table A4.1.) are used when entering equip-
     ment into the TRS. HQ AFCA/GCLV must approve any changes to the equipment-type standard
     designators.
        4.7.10.1. Performs an annual inventory of all reportable base-level (host, tenant, and direct
        reporting units) PWCS equipment. EXCEPTION: Air Force Reserve and/or Air National
        Guard tenant units may report their PWCS inventory data directly to their respective command
        PWCS managers.
        4.7.10.2. Provides using organizations with a copy of the last annual inventory report for rec-
        onciliation not later than 1 June each year, before a change in unit PWCS managers, or when
        requested by the unit commander.
        4.7.10.3. Updates the TRS database to reflect inventory changes, then completes the TRS
        MAJCOM export routines. Completes export routines each calendar year. Sends the export
        routines to the MAJCOM PWCS manager not later than 11 July.
        4.7.10.3. (USAFE) HQ USAFE/SCNM-identified discrepancies in base-level TRS data will
        be corrected and forwarded as the USAFE export routine within 30 days of notification.
AFI33-106_USAFESUP1_I 29 DECEMBER 2003                                                                13


        4.7.10.4. Retains a copy of latest using organization PWCS inventory list, signed and vali-
        dated by the unit PWCS manager and supervisor/commander, for at least one year.
     4.7.11. Trains unit PWCS managers. Initial training should occur as soon as possible but not later
     than 60 days after the unit PWCS manager has been assigned. Accomplish refresher training annu-
     ally. See Attachment 5 to conduct unit PWCS manager training.
        4.7.11.1. Maintains a PWCS point of contact listing for all units with TRS reportable
        base-level assets. Validate listing at least once a year.
     4.7.12. Briefs unit PWCS managers annually on the monitoring consent requirements outlined in
     AFI 33-219, Telecommunications Monitoring and Assessment Program (TMAP).
     4.7.13. Crossfeeds surplus PWCS equipment lists and requests for equipment assistance to unit
     PWCS managers and the MAJCOM PWCS manager. Unserviceable items or items that have
     accumulated 100 or more replacement points under the Five Year Replacement Plan are exempt
     from this requirement.
     4.7.13. (USAFE) Excess USAFE PWCS assets will be advertised for redistribution as outlined in
     Attachment 10 (Added).
     4.7.14. Performs limited maintenance on PWCS devices when such actions are beneficial to the
     Air Force and not specifically prohibited under the terms of an existing maintenance contract.
     4.7.15. Conducts a review of mission requirements, cost of tools, test and support equipment,
     repair parts stock, facilities, training, and personnel prior to establishing an organic maintenance
     capability. Full organic maintenance usually far exceeds the cost of “as-required” or contractor
     maintenance.
     4.7.16. (Added-USAFE) Use USAFE Form 23, Land Mobile Radio Service Record, to record
     all maintenance actions performed on serially numbered LMR assets and then log all maintenance
     in the appropriate section of the LMR TRS.
     4.7.17. (Added-USAFE) When transferring equipment from one unit to another, it is the gaining
     PWCS manager’s responsibility to obtain a valid frequency assignment before transferring the
     PWCS assets.
     4.7.18. (Added-USAFE) In conjunction with HQ USAFE/SCNM, develop and maintain a System
     Life Cycle plan for all PWCS assets. This plan should include TRS replacement data, mission
     changes, new technologies. (i.e. encryption, trunking, new areas of coverage, Over-the-Air Rekey-
     ing [OTAR]).
  4.8. Air Force Standard PWCS TRS:
     4.8.1. The TRS is the only authorized Air Force inventory control software for PWCS assets.
     4.8.2. Base and MAJCOM-level TRS users must comply with DoDD 5000.1, The Defense Acqui-
     sition System, October 23, 2000; DoD 5000.2-R, Mandatory Procedures for Major Defense
     Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) and Major Automated Information System (MAIS) Acquisition
     Programs, March 1996, with changes 1, 2, 3, and 4; and AFIs 33-104, Base-Level Planning and
     Implementation; and 33-112, Computer Systems Management.
        4.8.2.1. TRS users are not authorized to modify the software configuration. Submit suggested
        modifications to HQ AFCA/GCLV through the MAJCOM PWCS manager.
14                                                  AFI33-106_USAFESUP1_I 29 DECEMBER 2003


        4.8.3. The following systems/devices are reportable in the TRS:
           4.8.3.1. Land mobile radios.
           4.8.3.2. CT/PCS/ESMR/Pagers/wireless PDAs with CCI modules/attachments.
           4.8.3.3. Intra-Squad Radios (ISR) operating in the 380-399.9 MHz band (see Table A2.1.).
           4.8.3.4. Air Force-owned paging system base station transmitters.
        4.8.4. Do not report cellular telephones, pagers, wireless PDAs and other alternative communica-
        tion devices costing less than $500.00 (e.g., Family Radio Service [FRS] radios) in the TRS,
        unless they are equipped with CCI modules/attachments. The using organization is responsible for
        management and tracking these low cost alternative assets, as necessary (see paragraph 4.12.2.1.).
        PDAs will be accounted for using Information Management Processing System in accordance
        with AFI 33-112.
     4.9. CT/PCS/ESMR Systems:
        4.9.1. CT/PCS/ESMR systems may be subject to overload and user lockout during emergencies
        (fires, floods, earthquakes, etc.) and at peak operating times. Dual mode digital CTs will default
        back to analog operation whenever digital cell site signal strength is lost or when operating in ana-
        log only CT system areas.
        4.9.2. CT/PCS/ESMR assets and service acquired through base-wide, regional and/or national
        contracts often reduce the owning units operating and maintenance costs. Assign users with high
        roaming requirements to CT/PCS/ESMR contracts appropriate to their roaming needs (i.e.,
        regional, national, or worldwide). Compare options for lease/purchase and integrated instrument
        air time contracts to airtime only contracts prior to making final acquisition decisions. Base this
        evaluation on total estimated life-cycle costs including expected equipment life versus the pace of
        technology upgrades, scheduled and unscheduled replacement, maintenance support, etc.
        4.9.2. (USAFE) Pay-as-you-go (prepaid card) cell phones may be used to support urgent cellular
        telephone requirements when communications services must be responsive and use will be infre-
        quent.
        4.9.3. The analog cellular version of the Secure Telephone Unit-III (STU-III) is out of production.
        Existing cellular STU-III assets will continue to receive encryption key support from the NSA
        central facility until FY05.
           4.9.3.1. Recommend migrating to newer NSA-approved secure (e.g., Future Narrowband
           Digital Terminal) capable CT/PCS/ESMR, where available.
        4.9.4. Dual-Number Capable Cellular Telephones (CT).
           4.9.4.1. Local PWCS managers may issue dual-number capable CTs to personnel whose offi-
           cial duties require them to be immediately accessible to organizational elements such as com-
           mand posts and operational centers, regardless of the individuals proximity to a wireline
           telephone, on a 24 hour-per-day, 7 day-per-week basis.
           4.9.4.2. Issue the CT with only the primary number activated and billable to a government
           account. Refer to AFI 33-111 for policy and guidelines for government-owned wireless tele-
           phone billing.
           4.9.4.3. Activation of the secondary number capability is at the option of the CTs authorized
AFI33-106_USAFESUP1_I 29 DECEMBER 2003                                                                  15


        end user.
        4.9.4.4. Activation of a dual-number capability is not permitted on secure CTs.
        4.9.4.5. Local PWCS managers will make sure all personnel issued dual-number capable CTs
        are briefed regarding their personal liability for all costs associated with the activation and use
        of the secondary number to establish a “personal account.” These costs include, but are not
        limited to: activation fees; monthly recurring charges; long distance, roaming, excess minutes
        and other airtime fees; maintenance and insurance fees; and any charges/fees resulting from
        misuse of a government-owned instrument or resulting from an individual’s failure to cancel
        the personal account, when the CT is no longer authorized for use.
        4.9.4.6. Authorized end user of a government-owned, dual-number capable CT:
            4.9.4.6.1. Shall sign an agreement, produced in accordance with MAJCOM Judge Advo-
            cate and Contracting office guidance, that contains appropriate “hold harmless” and “per-
            sonal liability” clauses, prior to being issued a dual-number capable CT, without regard to
            whether the user elects to immediately activate the secondary number capability or not.
            4.9.4.6.2. If a secondary number is activated, the user must make sure all bills associated
            with the personal account are mailed directly to the user’s home address or post office box.
        4.9.4.7. When a CT is no longer required for the performance of duties, the user shall make
        sure that the personal account is closed and the secondary number zeroized by the vendor,
        prior to returning the CT to the local PWCS manager for reuse.
     4.9.5. (Added-USAFE) Use regular telephone (land lines) as a first priority when and where
     available, since CT services are generally more expensive.
     4.9.6. (Added-USAFE) Use of CT is only for official business. An occasional personal call on a
     CT can be justified under some circumstances (e.g. call home to inform a spouse of member’s
     whereabouts when delayed by official business or in emergency situations) when access to other
     reasonable communications (e.g. pay phone) is not available. However, individual must reimburse
     the government for personal calls that cause the cellular phone bill to exceed its monthly-allotted
     usage charge. Users who are determined by the unit commanders, designated representative, or
     CSO as making unreasonable personal calls or fraudulent calls on a CT will be required to reim-
     burse the government for service charges and military personnel are subject to disciplinary action
     under the UCMJ. Similarly, violations by a civilian employee may result in administrative disci-
     plinary action under AFI 36-704. Personal calls on government cell phone should be the excep-
     tion, not the rule. (See AFI 33-111, paragraph 25.5, and DOD Directive 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics
     Regulation, Section 2-301.) Except in emergencies, drivers of motor vehicles will not use CTs
     while the vehicle is in motion.
  4.10. FRS and ISR Systems:
     4.10.1. The FCC permits the unregulated use of FRS radios within the territorial limits of the fifty
     United States (U.S.), the District of Columbia, and the Caribbean and Pacific Insular areas (U.S.).
     FRS radios may be operated on or over any other area of the world, except within the territorial
     limits of areas where radio-communications are regulated by another agency of the U.S. or within
     the territorial limits of any foreign government.
16                                                  AFI33-106_USAFESUP1_I 29 DECEMBER 2003


        4.10.1. (USAFE) FRS devices purchased from US&P sources are not compatible to European
        specifications and frequency allocations. FRS devices purchase for use in Europe must contain a
        "CE" (European Community) stamp or pertinent markings that validate European approval. Users
        must register their frequencies with the installation spectrum management office. Illegal FRS
        equipment is subject to confiscation.
            4.10.1.1. FRS devices were intended for use by family, friends, and associates to communi-
            cate among themselves within a small area, or while on group outings. They may also be used
            for military-related (administrative) communications, provided they are not used for classi-
            fied, SBU, command and control, operational, fire/crash, security and/or emergency response/
            medical communications (see Table A2.1.). FRS units are not designed to make telephone
            calls. No FCC controlled FRS frequency channels can be assigned to any specific individual or
            organization. The 14 commercial FRS channels may be used only on a “take turns” basis.
            4.10.1.1. (USAFE) FRS radios may be used by Air Force members and employees of all non-
            appropriated fund activities (e.g. Services) and some appropriated fund activities, as follows:
            To communicate with nongovernment users during Air Force-supported or -sponsored com-
            munity activities, i.e. scouts, Special Olympics, youth activities and sporting events, funeral
            details for deceased military veterans. In addition, work crews may use FRS radios for admin-
            istrative purposes when communicating in warehouses, commissaries, base exchanges, billet-
            ing areas, and internal coordination. Under no circumstance will FRS radios be permitted for
            use in controlled areas without express written consent of the installation commander and full
            compliance with all security directives. Operational use is defined as anything operationally
            related to daily mission accomplishment (i.e. training, deficiencies, shortfalls, force strength
            and composition, status reporting).
            4.10.1.2. ISR radios are nearly identical to FRS radios. They operate on 14 channels that
            located in the 380-399.9 MHz band (396.875, 397.125, 397.175, 397.375, 397.425, 397.550,
            397.950, 398.050, 399.425, 399.475, 399.725, 399.925 and 399.975 MHz). Since this band is
            set aside for use by the DoD, within the US&P, make application through your MAJCOM
            spectrum management office for use of this ISR spectrum, prior to equipment acquisition.
            Obtain host nation approval to use these 14 frequencies, if ISR radio operation is outside the
            US&P. As with its FRS counterpart, they may be used for military-related (administrative)
            communications, provided they are not used for classified, SBU, command and control, oper-
            ational, fire/crash, security and/or emergency response/medical communications (see Table
            A2.1.).
     4.11. Wireless Personal Digital Assistants (PDA).
        4.11.1. PDAs (e.g., Palm Pilot®, Cassiopeia® or Blackberry™) that are designed solely for use
        as automated data processing equipment are subject to Air Force policy and guidance governing
        management, use, and security of desktop and notebook computer systems. (See AFI 33-202,
        Computer Security and AFI 33-112.)
        4.11.2. Hybrid PDAs designed as multi-functional voice and data wireless communications-com-
        puter devices with CCI modules/attachments will be managed by the local PWCS manager and
        entered into the TRS database in accordance with the guidance in paragraph 4.8.
     4.12. Using Organizations:
AFI33-106_USAFESUP1_I 29 DECEMBER 2003                                                                 17


  4.12. (USAFE) All unit commanders are responsible for ensuring their personnel properly purchase
  all LMRs, cellular telephones, and pagers by following the guidance in the basic instruction and this
  supplement. All unit commanders will ensure they have procedures in place to ensure their unit’s
  LMR, cellular telephone, and pager assets have been approved by the installation CSO and properly
  accounted for in accordance with the basic instruction and this supplement.
     4.12.1. Commander or Designated Representative:
     4.12.1. (USAFE) All unit commanders are responsible for ensuring their personnel manage and
     operate their CT assets consistent with DoD 5500.7-R, Section 2-301; AFI 33-111; AFI 33-219;
     AFI 33-106, and this supplement.

         4.12.1.2. Budgets for the payment of all bills relating to the acquisition, operation (including
         cellular “air time” charges) and maintenance of their unit PWCS equipment. AFI 33-111, Tele-
         phone Systems Management, outlines billing procedures associated with the acquisition and
         operation of CT/PCS/ESMR devices.
         4.12.1.3. Annually revalidates all unit-owned, PWCS assets with the CSO to determine if
         existing equipment meets known unit mission requirements.
     4.12.2. Using organizations are normally responsible for the costs (lease or purchase price, main-
     tenance costs, connection fees, monthly access fees, airtime fees, etc.) associated with the acquisi-
     tion, use, and maintenance of all CT/PCS/ESMR/wireless PDA devices acquired for their unit's
     official use. EXCEPTION: Centralized service/maintenance contracts may be established that per-
     mit budgeting/billing for service/maintenance actions through a designated base unit/agency (see
     AFI 33-111). Address all questions regarding International Merchant Purchase Authorization Card
     (IMPAC) usage for commercial services to base contracting offices.
     4.12.2. (USAFE) Units will accomplish AF Form 3215, IT/NSS Requirements Document, or
     locally developed equivalent to document all CT requirements and must have an approved
     requirements document before an IMPAC purchase is made. Using organizations will maintain CT
     records and cost data to support future audits.
         4.12.2.1. Manages and tracks all low cost, alternative communications systems/devices not
         reportable in the TRS, as necessary (see paragraph 4.8.4.).
         4.12.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Use DES Type 2 encryption on ALL LMR communications, once
         new equipment is received or once assets are equipped.
     4.12.3. Unit PWCS Manager:
         4.12.3.1. Sends a copy of the unit PWCS manager appointment letter to the base PWCS man-
         ager.
         4.12.3.2. Performs an inventory of TRS reportable PWCS equipment during the month of
         June each year (for reconciliation with the base PWCS manager’s TRS inventory), before a
         change in unit PWCS managers, or when requested by the unit commander. Paragraph 4.8.3.
         identifies reportable PWCS equipment.
         4.12.3.2. (USAFE) Tenant organizations are responsible to the host wing commander for con-
         trol and accountability of their TRS reportable assets managed by the base PWCS manager.

     4.12.3.5. Prepares requirements documents for all unit PWCS mission requirements, using
     functional terms, in accordance with AFI 33-103 and Air Force 23-series supply instructions.
     Multiple users within a unit with identical requirements may be covered by the same require-
     ment document (e.g., a technical solution that establishes a unit LMR net with 10 users nor-
     mally requires only one document). (See Attachment 6 for PWCS radio deployment planning
     guidance.)
     4.12.3.6. Makes sure excess TRS reportable equipment is turned over to the base PWCS man-
     ager for redisposition, salvage, or return to the contractor (leased equipment).

                             DETERMINING TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS

A2.1. Overview . As the Base PWCS Manager, one of your most important tasks will be to determine the
technical solution that best satisfies your customer’s communications requirements. This attachment pro-
vides a tool to assist your decision making process. Requiring units/organizations may also use this tool to
assist in preparing requirements documents.

A2.2. Existing Services . PWCS Managers must be aware of the wireless communications services cur-
rently available in, or planned for, the in-garrison/deployed local area to determine an effective technical
solution. Sources for this information include:
     A2.2.1. MAJCOM wireless communications offices (e.g., PWCS manager).
     A2.2.2. Local telephone/cellular/PCS service providers.
     A2.2.3. Electronics stores specializing in communications services/devices.
     A2.2.4. Local and regional communications company sales representatives.
     A2.2.5. Trade and professional publications.
     A2.2.6. Ads in newspapers and magazines.
     A2.2.7. Ads on local radio and television stations.

A2.3. Types of Services . Table A2.1. lists examples of the types of wireless services that may be con-
sidered when determining a technical solution.
AFI33-106_USAFESUP1_I 29 DECEMBER 2003                                                                        29


Table A2.1. Types of Services.
Type               Functions and Capabilities
LMR                Conventional: A radio network, composed of handheld and mobile radios, base
                   stations and repeaters, in which each user group is assigned their own operating
                   frequencies.
                   Trunked: A radio network, composed of handheld and mobile radios, control
                   consoles, base stations and repeaters, that relies on computer controlled time
                   sharing of a small number of frequencies to serve a large population of users.
                   ISLMR: Radios designed for operation in hazardous environments, available as
                   conventional or trunked.
Pagers             Small devices used to deliver short voice or alphanumeric messages to the user.
                   Delivery may be restricted to a local service area, or may be global via satellite.
                   Although messages are usually one-way, two-way services may be available in
                   some areas.
C e l l u l a r / P C S Radio devices that offer telephone-like services through a wireless infrastructure.
Services                PCS devices may also offer pager- like (short text message) functions.
ESMR               Cell phone like devices that offer the added functions of “direct” connections to
                   other ESMR users and paging/text messaging.
Mobile Satellite Cell phone like devices with the ability to connect with either the terrestrial based
Services         cell phone/PCS infrastructure, or to a satellite. Existing services also offer a
                 paging only device.
Wireless Local Administrative telephone systems where copper phone lines are replaced by a
Loop/Wireless wireless RF system (in some cases, copper wires are never installed). Similar to a
Office Systems cellular phone system with greatly reduced mobility – generally limited to a
               campus area or single building/office.
JTRS               A family of software programmable, multiband/multimode radios that operate
                   from 2 MHz to 2 gigahertz. These radios offer differing levels of service
                   depending on the operating domain (Ground, Fixed, and Airborne).
FRS Radio          One of the Citizens Band radio services intended for use by members of a family
                   or workgroup to communicate among themselves. Unregulated use of FRS radios
                   within the US&P may replace LMRs for certain administrative communications,
                   but must not be used to transmit classified, SBU, command and control,
                   operational, fire/crash, security or emergency response/medical communications.
                   FRS radios are non-reportable under the TRS. Use of FRS radios outside the
                   US&P is regulated by the host nation and may not be available for military use in
                   this configuration.
ISR                ISR radios are of similar construction and operational characteristics as FRS
                   radios. All ISR radios are TRS reportable and utilize the 380-399.9 MHz band.
                   Spectrum authorization must be obtained through MAJCOM Spectrum Managers
                   and the appropriate AFFMA or host nation prior to acquisition and use.

A2.4. Guidance . The following instructions provide additional guidance:
     A2.4.1. AFI 33-201 describes security standards that must be met according to the information being
     processed by the selected device.
     A2.4.2. AFI 33-103 contains information on identifying requirements and developing technical solu-
     tions.

A2.5. Determining a Technical Solution . Answer the questions in Figure A2.1. using the information
contained in your customer’s requirement document. This will help you determine the technology that
may best fill their requirements. After selecting a technology, you may need to contact local vendors to
better define the actual device required.

A2.6. Trunked LMR Systems. Before considering a TLMR System, you must be able to answer “Yes”
to the majority of the questions listed below:
     A2.6.1. Are there other federal agencies in the area (within 30 kilometers) that would be willing to
     share a TLMR system with you?
     A2.6.2. Does your base have more than 700 nondeployable users, and/or 35 or more radio networks?
     A2.6.3. Are the existing radio networks overcrowded and/or restricted in number, causing mission
     degradation?
     A2.6.4. Are you able to obtain new frequency authorizations to meet demand for radio communica-
     tions?
     A2.6.5. Is your existing conventional LMR network experiencing increased levels of interference due
     to frequency congestion in the area?

A2.7. Final Considerations . When preparing a technical solution, you must consider the following:
     A2.7.1. Can the selected device meet security requirements?
     A2.7.2. Will the selected device allow the user to interoperate with the required individuals/agencies?
     (A communication device that doesn’t talk to anyone else is useless, no matter how many bells and
     whistles it has.)
     A2.7.3. Does the selected solution make sense from a business perspective? Does it save the Air
     Force money in the long run?
     A2.7.4. Does the selected solution fit into the Base Roadmap (formerly know as the Base Blueprint)
     as developed by the Base Systems Telecommunications Engineering Manager?
     A2.7.5. If you answer “No” to any of these questions, you should reconsider your solution.

                             PLANNING FOR PWCS DEPLOYMENT

A6.1. In planning for PWCS deployment, the base CSO and PWCS managers will advise the wing/base
and unit level planners to consider their PWCS requirements well in advance of any deployment. Other
units must plan for deployment anywhere. Some of the factors to consider are:

A6.2. Will you need your handheld telecommunications devices? Can the host base satisfy the require-
ment?

A6.3. Are your in-garrison operating frequencies usable in the deployed host area? Coordinate overseas
requirements through MAJCOM and Air Force theater command frequency management offices.

A6.4. How will you maintain your deployed telecommunications devices?

A6.5. Do you need spares? What is the probability of combat damage or loss in transit or handling?

A6.6. Will chargers work on host-nation or host-base power sources? (Voltages and frequencies vary by
nation.)

A6.7. Will you need fixed/mobile base stations, repeaters, and antennas? Should you preposition them, or
will you carry and install them yourself?

A6.8. Will you need special procedures and call signs?

A6.9. Will your deployed telecommunications system give you adequate geographical coverage?

A6.10. Do you need encryption (DES, Type 1, etc.)?

A6.11. What about interoperability with other units? (Frequencies, DES, Type 1, etc.)

A6.12. Is your deploying telecommunications device capable of operating within host base/host nation
standards and technical parameters (i.e., frequency, channel spacing, power, etc.)?

A6.13. Develop a deployed continuity folder by tailoring the information in Attachment 2 to meet your
requirements. The base points of contact now become the deployed points of contact.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
Added references to Secure Global System for Mobile Communications and Iridium satellite phones. Pro-
vided guidance on Intrinsically Safe Land Mobile Radio (ISLMR).
4.1. Refer to AFI 33-116, Long-Haul Telecommunications Management, for guidance on satellite phones
(e.g. INMARSAT). Refer to AFI 33-209 for guidance Secure Global System for Mobile Communications
(secure cellular phones) and Iridium satellite phones.
4.7.9. The Base Safety Staff and Base Fire Marshal will coordinate with the Command Safety Staff and
Command Fire Marshal on all purchase and use of ISLMRs. The Command Safety Office and Command
Fire Marshal must closely scrutinize requirements for ISLMRs and approve only those assets deemed as
mission essential (i.e. required by AFI, AFOSH Standards, Fire Protection directives, and command
directives). ISLMRs have stringent inspection, maintenance, certification, and recertification require-
ments. The inspection and maintenance tails impact the base LMR maintenance contract. The Command
Safety Office and Command Fire Marshal will cite the applicable reference or directive on the approved
AF 3215, IT/NSS Requirements Document and forward a copy to the Base CSO/PWCS Manager.
4.7.9.1. Comply with manufacturer inspection intervals as specified in equipment technical manual. Turn
in equipment to IS certified contractor service center or manufacturer Factory Mutual (FM) depot. The
PWCS managers will use the LMR Tracking and Reporting System to document inspections and mainte-
nance on ISLMR.
4.7.9.2. (Added) Potential use of ISLMRs includes work in hazardous locations such as confined spaces
and near flammable fuels, chemicals, and explosive atmospheres. When initially developed and during
annual reviews, Master Entry Plans (MEP) will address (if known), the use of ISLMRs within confined
spaces. If ISLMRs are not included on the MEPs, and it is later determined that ISLMRs will need to be
used within confined spaces, then the use of ISLMRs in confined spaces must first be coordinated with
the installation Confined Space Program Team before they are used in confined spaces.
4.7.9.3. (Added) When an ISLMR is sent in for maintenance, it must be serviced by a manufacturer FM
certified service center to maintain its Intrinsically Safe (IS) certification. ISLMR will be sent in for main-
tenance if the case is cracked, IS certification is compromised, or if the radio has been tampered with.
4.7.9.4. (Added) Local LMR maintenance contractors must receive IS certification from the manufac-
turer. If the contractor is not IS certified, the ISLMR must be sent to the manufacturer FM depot to main-
tain its IS certification.
4.7.9.5. (Added) Users and managers may replace ISLMR accessory (i.e. batteries and antennas) provided
they are replaced with like-IS accessory (i.e. IS batteries, IS antennas).
