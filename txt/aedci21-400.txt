   conduct a monthly review of the audits to ensure the following minimum criteria is met: A
   random sample of 30 items of TMDE is reviewed per month for compliance with T.O 00-20-
   14, and AFI 21-113. The results of each review with or without a finding are recorded.

     Plan (CAP) will be documented within 7 calendar days of the audit.
     5.2. Results of PMEL Internal Audits will be maintained. The Laboratory PM will conduct
     a quarterly review of the audits to ensure the following minimum criteria is met: Internal
     Audits are performed annually. Audits include entire review of PMEL’s Quality System,
