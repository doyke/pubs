This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 91-2, Safety Programs, providing guid-
ance for safe explosives operations in the transportation, handling, operation, and disposition of smoke
grenades and ground burst simulators (GBS) during local exercises. It also references Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards; Technical Order (TO) 11A-1-46, Fire Fighting Guid-
ance, Transportation, and Storage; TO 11A8-2-1, Hand & Rifle Grenades…Flares & Signals, Smoke Pots
and Land Mines; TO 11A10-27-7, Storage & Maintenance Procedures for Simulators, Battlefield Effects;
and AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations. It applies to all 49th Fighter Wing Exercise Evaluation Team (EET)
personnel involved in employing these devices. Maintain records created as a result of published pro-
cesses IAW AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and dispose of records in accordance with (IAW)
the AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), available from the Air Force Portal at the AF Records Infor-
mation Management System (AFRIMS) link. Contact supporting records managers as required. Refer

                  ACTUATING PYROTECHNICS/SIMULATORS AND DEVICES

5.1. Safety Requirements :
     5.1.1. Ensure activation area is clear of trash, vegetation or any other flammables that may cause a
     fire hazard.
     5.1.2. If other than approved locations are being considered for device activation, ensure safe dis-
     tances are met and proposed areas meet requirements IAW Chapter 3.
     5.1.3. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) required:
        5.1.3.1. Leather Gloves.
        5.1.3.2. Hearing Protection for GBSs.
        5.1.3.3. Eye Protection.

5.2. Procedures for Actuating Pyrotechnic Devices.
     5.2.1. M18 Smoke Grenades:
        5.2.1.1. Hazards. Smoke grenades are 1.4 hazard class explosives. The technical hazard for smoke
        grenades is moderate fire and toxic smoke. High concentrations of smoke may be lethal.

                                              WARNING
Ensure safety pin is in place before removing the grenade from containers. Do not use the pull ring for
lifting or handling the grenade. If the safety pin is not in place, do not attempt to remove the grenade
from the container.
                                                 NOTE
M18 grenades are the only smoke grenades approved for use until current guidance is updated or
changed.

      5.2.1.2. Smoke Grenade Functioning Procedures:
          5.2.1.2.1. Ensure the grenade safety pin is installed. Remove grenades from containers.
          5.2.1.2.2. Hold the grenade in the throwing hand with the safety lever pressed against the
          palm.
          5.2.1.2.3. When ready to throw, pull the safety pin while continuing to hold safety lever down.
          Once the pin is removed the grenade is armed and must be thrown.
          5.2.1.2.4. Throw grenade into the pit, then clear the area approximately 30 feet upwind.
          5.2.1.2.5. The fuse begins to function upon release of the lever. After a delay of 1 to 2 seconds,
          the grenade filler ignites and begins to emit a colored smoke.
   5.2.2. M115A2 Ground Burst Simulators:


                                              WARNING
Simulators contain photoflash powder. These munitions will not be handled roughly, thrown, or
dropped. Unpacked simulators dropped in excess of 3 feet shall be considered unserviceable and not
used.

      5.2.2.1. Hazards. GBSs are 1.2.2 hazard class explosives. The technical hazards of these items are
      mass fire, light missile, and mass detonation. Loose gravel or debris at point of detonation can
      become a missile.

Figure 5.2. M115A2 Ground Burst Simulator.




      5.2.2.2. GBS Functioning/Actuating Procedures:
          5.2.2.2.1. Inspect simulator prior to use. Ensure safety clip is installed prior to handling.
          5.2.2.2.2. Hold simulator in throwing hand and remove metal safety clip from the cap.
          5.2.2.2.3. Remove the cap from the safety clip igniter.
          5.2.2.2.4. Grasp the cap and pull-cord as a unit and firmly pull the cord through the igniter.
          The safety fuse ignites the quickmatch in the whistle assembly and the quickmatch ignites the
          whistle composition.

           5.2.2.2.5. Toss the simulator into the retaining pit and evacuate to as close to 125 feet as pos-
           sible, with back to munitions. After a 6-10 second delay, the powder charges and whistle
           assembly are ignited.

5.3. Pre-task brief. All personnel involved with the activation and functioning of pyrotechnics will con-
duct a pre-task safety brief prior to commencement of operations using Attachment 3.
HOLLOMANAFBI91-201 17 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                        17


                                                 Chapter 6

                            USE OF FIREARMS BLANK AMMUNITION

6.1. Realworld vs Training Policy. Maintain realworld security forces outside of “Exercise Area.” Mix-
ing live and blank ammunition within an exercise area is prohibited. All magazines used with blank
ammunition will have the bottom one third of the magazine painted light blue to identify training use only
status.

6.2. Safety Requirements :
   6.2.1. Keep live and blank ammunition separate. Mixing live and blank ammunition within an exer-
   cise area is prohibited. All magazines used for blank ammunition during exercises will have the bot-
   tom one third of the magazine painted light blue to signify training use only magazines.
   6.2.2. All exercise weapons will have blank adapters affixed to them while in the exercise area. The
   Exercise Team Chief will brief safe firing distances to all exercise participants prior to the start of an
   exercise.
   6.2.3. Do not store live ammunition inside an “Exercise Area.”


                                               WARNING
Use of “Real World” security forces, armed with live ammunition within a training environment where
blank ammunition is present, poses a significant potential for a deadly accident. Use of “Real World”
security forces with live ammunition is prohibited from all exercise and training environments.

6.3. Ammunition Issue/Accountability. EET members with current Pyrotechnics Orientation Course
training will breakout and issue loaded magazines to Security Forces Squadron (SFS) / Opposing Forces
(OPFOR) team members. At the end of exercise, the custodian will reconcile remaining assets and pre-
pare/process expenditure documentation.

6.4. Disposition of brass residue. SFS /OPFOR team chiefs are responsible to ensure all members
police immediate areas and collect expended brass casings. In order to prevent aircraft Foreign Object
Damage (FOD) on the airfield, the team members will ensure all expended casings are collected upon ter-
mination of scenario. The team members will ensure all remaining blank ammunition and expended cas-
ings are returned to the licensed location and turned over to the 49 FW/XP representatives upon
termination of scenario or at the end of the shift.

6.5. Team Safety Brief. The SFS lead EET member in conjunction with 49 FW/XP team chief, must
develop clear-cut instructions to ensure real world and training forces fully understand response require-
ments. Instructions will include briefing overall rules of engagement to all participants prior to the start of
an exercise. Additionally, ensure all forces to include OPFOR clearly understand that the exercise will
cease immediately when responding to any real world situations. The Team Chief will also make it clear
and empower everyone to stop activity (call a time out), when safety infractions are observed.
