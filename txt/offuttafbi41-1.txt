4                                                       OFFUTTAFBI41-1 1 AUGUST 2011


       3.4.5. Once notified by the AED unit coordinator that an AED has been used in an
       emergency situation and forwarded to the Biomedical Equipment Technician at the 55 th
       MDG or BMET for Post Arrest Summary download, the PAD Program Manager will
       take the summary immediately from BMET, complete OAFB Form 41 AED
       Coordinated Report for the Medical Director, www.e-Publishing.af.mil and forward it
       to the Medical Director for review. The Medical Director should receive the comp leted
       report within one duty day of deploying the AED.
          3.4.5.1. The Post Arrest Summary will be forwarded to the patient’s medical record
          once reviewed by the Medical Director. The PAD Program Manager will maintain a

       3.5.3. Each unit commander has full authority to purchase and implement any number of
       AEDs, as they desire. The decision to purchase AEDs should be discussed with the PAD
       Medical Director to assess risks for SCA in a work area. However, each unit will
       implement the minimum as recommended in the initial base assessment. All purchases

     will immediately follow the Post-Use Procedure Instruction (Attachment 3).
         3.6.6.1. The Program Manager must be notified immediately after an AED is
         deployed.
         3.6.6.2. Arrange for Traumatic Stress Response (TSR) debriefing for all individuals
         involved (Attachment 4) which can be arranged through Life Skills (Mental Health).
         3.6.6.3. The Unit AED Coordinator is responsible for the restocking of accessory
         supplies after an AED was used in an emergency situation.
  3.7. Responders:
     3.7.1. Responders are individuals who are trained in BLS and who will respond to an
     emergency. Their specific training shall be set forth in accordance with local policy.
     3.7.2. Trained responders must follow the protocol in an emergency situation as depicted
     in the "AED-Chain of Survival" (Attachment 2).
  3.8. Medical Logistics:
     3.8.1. All AEDs purchased with Defense Health Program (DHP) dollars MUST be
     loaded in the Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) System with the full
     acquisition price under the Responsibility Center/Cost Center (RC/CC) of the section or
     organization that will ―own‖ the device. If an account does not exist one must be created.
     Nomenclature must be ―Public Access Defibrillator.‖ Inspection interval should be set
     for 12 months.
     3.8.2. All AEDs purchased with ―Line‖ dollars must be loaded on the organization
     CA/CRL with the full acquisition price and MUST be gained in DMLSS at no cost under
     the account of the owning organization. If an account does not exist one must be created.
     3.8.3. Maintain a list of all organizations with these devices to ensure that QA messages
     are disseminated effectively and efficiently.
     3.8.4. Maintenance of these devices is limited and should be done in accordance with the
     manufacturer’s literature. At this time, comprehensive calibration verification is not
     recommended unless specified by the manufacturer. AFMSA/SGSLE recommends an
     annual inspection of all PAD devices to ensure the integrity of the unit, status of the
     batteries, and patient pads. During this annual inspection, 55 MDG BMETs should
     validate, if possible, that user maintenance is being performed.
 6                                                         OFFUTTAFBI41-1 1 AUGUST 2011


        3.8.5. Unscheduled maintenance should be coordinated with the 55 MDG BMET shop to
        ensure that Historical Maintenance Record is updated appropriately. Most AEDs
        designed for use in a PAD program come with a warranty period ranging 4 to 7 years.
4. AED Selection. There are various companies that offer different types of AEDs, each with a
wide range in capabilities as well as price. Since it is much easier to familiarize responders with
a single unit's operation and maintenance, a single model has been designated for use on the
entire installation. Specifically, OAFB will implement/use the Medtronic Lifepak CR Plus,
which is manufactured by Medtronic Corporation. Medtronic currently is an authorized federal
supplier and has a federal contract number.
5. AED Location and Installation.
     5.1. The essential key to surviving a cardiac arrest is early access, early CPR, early
     defibrillation and early advanced care. Therefore, to provide the capability of early
     defibrillation, AEDs must be strategically placed throughout the organization.
        5.1.1. A facility site assessment should be accomplished to determine the number of
        AEDs that are necessary as well as their placement within your building. The PAD
        Medical Director will have final approval for placement of the AED’s taking into account
        the factors listed below.
        5.1.2. Factors to consider in determining AED placement include the following:
           5.1.2.1. Facility size and or accessibility.
           5.1.2.2. Number of employees in the facility.
           5.1.2.3. Identified ―High Risk‖ environments.
           5.1.2.4. Number of people that may have public access to the facility on a daily basis.
           5.1.2.5. Average age of the facility occupants.
           5.1.2.6. Incidence of heart disease given the population at hand.
           5.1.2.7. Emergency response protocol that may already be in place for your facility,
           keeping in mind that it is the time to initial shock that really matters.
        5.1.3. In order to achieve complete area coverage within a building, an AED should be
        positioned no more than one minute's travel time (one way) from any given point within
        the building.
        5.1.4. Optimal response time, from the identification of a person "down" to the arrival of
        AED on-scene, is three minutes or less.
        5.1.5. Optimal response time from the identification of a person down to the delivery of a
        shock (i.e. drop-to-shock) should be less than 5 minutes.
        5.1.6. An event timeline for a responder should ideally be as follows:
OFFUTTAFBI41-1 1 AUGUST 2011                                                                  7

                            Preparation of victim and application of chest pads
                            Detection of shockable rhythm
                            Delivery of shock


      5.1.7. AED accessory kits should be packed with the AED so that the responder will not
      lose time deciding what to take to the emergency. These kits provide items such as
      gloves, scissors, razor, tape, patient pads, a barrier mask, and a towel (Attachment 5).
   5.2. AEDs on OAFB will be placed at the following locations at minimum: Base Exchange,
   Offutt Field House, 55th Force Support Squadron Manpower and Personnel Flight (MPF),
   Patriot Club, Power Plant, Community Center, 55th Maintenance Group (Benny Davis), and
   on each Security Forces Patrol Vehicle on patrol (may be checked out of a central location).
5. 3. AEDs in medical units (ex. 55 MDG, 55 CES/CEF, Lincoln ANG Medical Unit) are not
included in the PAD program because these units are not available for public access.

                TRAUMATIC STRESS RESPONSE (TSR) INFORMATION

A4.1. What is TSR Stress Management? It is a comprehensive system of crisis intervention
designed to assist individuals and groups affected by traumatic events (natural disasters, terrorist
events, suicides, death - either accidental or intentional). Previously, this inte rvention was
known as critical incident stress management (CISM).
A4.2. What events might precipitate a request for TSR services? Many types of events have
the potential to produce individual and community traumatic stress. Events include large-scale
disasters (tornadoes, bombings, hurricanes, etc.) and small-scale disasters (suicide, death or near-
death of coworker, workplace violence event, etc.). TSR services will be provided after
traumatic events to help those who have experienced the events. The goal is to assist those
affected by traumatic events to cope with the normal stress reaction in an effective manner.
These actions are intended to minimize the impact of exposure to these events and prevent or
mitigate permanent disability if possible.
A4.3. What is the procedure for requesting TSR services? The office of record for TSR
services is the Mental Health Center (294-7411). Please address any inquiries about TSR
services to the Chief of the TSR team.
