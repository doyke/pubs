1. General.
   1.1. Official bulletin boards within organizations are an important means of communicating
   vital information to airmen as well as meeting regulatory and statutory requirements.
       1.1.1. While meeting these requirements, presenting a professional and orderly
       appearance of posted materials is important. Wing policy will be to reduce redundant
       postings, extraneous materials, and to ensure items not officially sanctioned or
       appropriate are not posted.
2. Official Bulletin Boards.
   2.1. Commanders and Section Chiefs will:
       2.1.1. Set up their respective Official Bulletin Board in a location where the majority of
       Airmen and their family members will have reasonable access; such as, building
 2                                                           482FWI33-302 27 OCTOBER 2011


        entrances or strategic places which will display information to the greatest number of
        individuals. To meet this objective, Official Bulletin Boards as defined in this instruction
        will not be located in Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF).
        2.1.2. Monitor the maintenance of the official bulletin board within their respective
        organization. Commanders and Section Chiefs will use their initiative and discretion in
        providing boards that present a neat and standardized appearance that matches the area
        décor, and meet requirements specified by 482 FW/CC and this instruction.
     2.2. Appoint a monitor and alternate to maintain each official bulletin board within their
     organization.
        2.2.1. Information concerning the location and responsible person for each official
        bulletin board will be kept readily available in each organizational headquarters or
        administrative staff sections. This information should be provided to the Wing OPR as
        required.
3. Bulletin Board Monitor Responsibilities.
     3.1. Bulletin boards will have clearly marked sections: “Official”, “Unofficial”, “Safety” and
     “Union”. More than one bulletin board may be necessary. The layout will be identified
     annually by the Wing OPR.
        3.1.1. Space on bulletin boards for union business will be in accordance with the Labor-
        Management Agreement.
     3.2. Monitors will ensure that documents located on the 482 FW CoP Bulletin Board Portal
     Page are printed and that only current displays are posted. This Portal Page contains all
     current, mandatory, and official bulletin board displays required to be posted. This page can
     be accessed from the 482 FW CoP main page.
     3.3. When organizational directives, other than this instruction, require specific documents
     be posted to official bulletin boards, the documents will be posted by the bulletin board
     monitor.
     3.4. Post all unofficial material according to the policy of the organization and ensure
     employee “For Sale” notices do not reference duty phone or office. This will prevent
     unauthorized use of government time and resources. Restricted unofficial material (such as
     political announcements, advertising of a commercial nature, and for sale items where a
     monetary gain will be made by a private company, organization, or group) is prohibited from
     being displayed.
     3.5. Maintain all bulletin boards to present a neat appearance.
     3.6. No visual aids (VA) are to be posted unless they are numbered and controlled as
     specified in AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. The Publishing Management
     office (482 CS/SCOK) assigns VA numbers.
4. Wing OPR Responsibilities:
     4.1. The Commander, 482d Communications Squadron (482 CS/CC) will be the wing OPR
     for Official Bulletin Boards in the 482 FW.

     4.1.1. 482 CS/CC will maintain a Portal Page to house all current, mandatory, and
     official bulletin board displays. This page can be accessed from the 482 FW CoP main
     page.
     4.1.2. 482 CS/CC will maintain a current listing of all 482 FW Bulletin Board locations
     and monitors.
     4.1.3. 482 CS/CC will inspect all Official Bulletin Boards annually with the Self-
     Inspection program as defined in 482 FWI 90-201, Self Inspection Program.
  4.2. 482 FW units or sections requiring Official Bulletin Board displays must send them in a
  digital format to 482 CS/CC for approval and posting to the Portal Page.
