2.4.1. Supervisors will provide a copy of the approved request for advanced leave to the base
civilian pay liaison prior to annotating the time and attendance record. The approval must
indicate the amount of hours approved.
2.10.1.4. Group commanders or equivalents are authorized to approve exigencies causing
cancellation of leave. Requests will be coordinated through the Civilian Personnel Section
(CPS).
3.11. Use of Advance Sick Leave. Supervisors will provide a copy of the approved request for
advanced leave to the base civilian pay liaison prior to annotating the time and attendance record.
The approval must indicate the amount of hours approved.
4.4. Who Approves LWOP. Group commanders or equivalents are authorized to approve
extensions of leave without pay in excess of one year. Extension requests will be coordinated
through the CPS.
8.1.1. Civilian Fitness Policy.
8.1.1.1. (Added) The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Department of the Air Force
have recognized that health promotion programs and a consistent exercise regimen significantly
reduce health risks in employees. Participants in fitness and lifestyle programs typically report
improved energy levels, job attitude, work performance and overall morale. These are all critical
factors in enhancing productivity. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Air Force to allow
eligible civilian employees the opportunity to participate in frequent, regular and/or routine
physical activities using excused absence.
8.1.1.2. (Added) Establishment and implementation of the civilian fitness policy is at the
discretion of the 56 FW Commander and is based on mission requirements. Consistent with
OPM and Air Force recognition that employee fitness enhances productivity; the purpose of the
56 FW policy is to establish a voluntary program to permit excused absence for appropriated
fund full-time permanent and term civilian employees to participate in physical fitness
activities. However, due to the work requirements that provide certain employees a paid lunch
period, because they cannot be released from the worksite, those employees should not normally
be excused to participate in physical fitness activities. Nevertheless, mission dictating, time may
be granted for these employees also.
8.1.1.3. (Added) Up to three (3) hours of excused absence per week may be granted for eligible
employees to participate in physical fitness and related activities. No additional time is granted
for dressing, showering, cleaning up, or travel. Upon an employee’s request, leave may be
granted to allow for longer periods of physical fitness activity. Unused excused absence will not
accumulate from one week to the next.
8.1.1.4. (Added) The objective of this policy is to enhance the Air Force’s mission by assisting
employees to become more physically fit in some appreciable manner. Examples of authorized
physical fitness activities are running, walking, jogging, bicycle riding, weight training,
swimming and structured exercises, i.e., push-ups, sit-ups, aerobics, etc. Golfing, bowling and
softball are examples of physical fitness activities that are not authorized under this policy.
Employees are encouraged to participate in squadron/group/wing aerobic fitness activities.

8.1.1.5. (Added) Employees must complete the Request for Approval of Excused Absence to
Participate in Physical Fitness Activities form (Attachment 2) and submit it to their supervisor
prior to starting physical fitness activities. The completed request, showing approved or
disapproved, will be maintained in the Supervisor’s Employee Work Folder.
8.1.1.6. (Added) Employees must obtain a fitness assessment from their primary care
provider/physician (obtained at the employee’s own expense). A statement from the physician
that physical fitness activities are permitted and identifying any limiting conditions must be
submitted with the request to participate in physical fitness activities.
8.1.1.7. (Added) Employees must notify their supervisor as soon as possible if their ability to
participate in previously approved physical fitness activities becomes limited.
8.1.1.8. (Added) Specific times for use of excused absence will be dictated by mission
requirements and approved in advance by the supervisor. Supervisors may adjust an employee’s
daily work schedule to accommodate the request to participate in physical fitness activities.
Supervisors may disallow participation for a short period of time and/or vary the times
employees may participate due to mission requirements.
8.1.1.9. (Added) The decision to deny, revoke or otherwise restrict excused absence for
individual employee’s participation in physical fitness activities will be based on mission
requirements or abuses personally attributable to the employee. Such decisions will not be
arbitrary or capricious and will be made by the supervisor. The decision to deny or revoke
employee participation in the program must be indorsed by squadron commanders.
8.1.1.10. (Added) Only on-base facilities, under the direct control of the 56 FW Commander,
may be used for purposes of this policy. For employees whose duty station is other than Luke
AFB, management may authorize other facilities within the confines of the duty station.
8.1.1.11. (Added) A log of excused absences for physical fitness activities will be jointly
maintained by each employee and their immediate supervisor. The log will include the date,
departure time, type of fitness activity, location and return time (Attachment 3) is a sample log
sheet). Time cards must be annotated with code “LN” along with the remark “physical fitness”
and initialed by the employee.
8.1.1.12. (Added) Employees must report to work before participating in fitness activity and
report back to work when the fitness activity is complete unless this requirement is waived by the
supervisor. This waiver requirement also applies when employees take part in fitness activities
in conjunction with their lunch period. Any waiver should be in writing and maintained with the
employee’s request to participate in the program.
8.1.1.13. (Added) Excused absence should not be approved for participation in physical fitness
activities on days when overtime/compensatory time is expected or has been previously
scheduled or when credit hours are accrued. Additionally, time spent in physical fitness
activities may not be used as the basis to accrue credit hours.
8.1.1.14. (Added) The authority to suspend, cancel or otherwise limit the policy in its entirety
exists with the 56 FW Commander and will be based on mission requirements. If such a
determination is made, advance notice will be provided in writing to the Union and any
applicable bargaining obligations will be satisfied.
