 MEMORANDUM FOR 80 FTW

 FROM: 80 FTW/IG

 SUBJECT: 80th Flying Training Wing Guidance Memorandum for The Commander’s Inspection
 Program

     By order of the Commander, this 80th Flying Training Wing Guidance Memorandum
(80FTWGM) immediately implements The Commander’s Inspection Program. This 80FTWGM
supersedes AFI 90-201 80 FTW SUP dated 1 April 2012. To the extent its directions are
inconsistent with other wing publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI
33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

     In advance of a final 80 FTWI 90-201, the attachment to this memorandum provides new
 guidance and procedures for implementation of the Commander’s Inspection Program that are
 effective immediately. Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-2 is the antecedent for the
 Commander’s Inspection Program.

     The guidance in this Memorandum becomes void after one year from the issued date, or upon
 incorporation of 80 FTWI 90-201, The Commander’s Inspection Program, whichever is earlier.




                                                       DAVID G. TOOGOOD, Lt Col, USAF

                                                                                                  3
                       COMMANDER’S INSPECTION PROGRAM

1.1. General Guidance.

    1.1.1. Applicability. This Wing Instruction applies to all 80 FTW units, organizations,
    functions, and contract activities.

    1.1.2. Parent Guidance. AFI 90-201 The Air Force Inspection System, Chapter 5, provides
    the overarching framework for the CCIP. A review of that publication is essential since its
    contents are not repeated in this Wing Instruction.

    1.1.3. Overview. The CCIP is designed to provide commanders at all levels the ability to
    readily and systematically assess the health of their core mission, assess deployment
    readiness, assess compliance with public law and other administrative requirements, identify
    improvement and innovation opportunities, and meet the requirements of parent guidance.
    The CCIP employs a comprehensive and transparent self-assessment program,
    internal/external validation, and exercises.

        1.1.3.1. The self-assessment program is the focal point of the CCIP and is intended to
        efficiently identify problems and areas for improvement. Commanders should stress
        accurate and honest self-assessments followed by effective corrective actions. The best
        units are not necessarily those with the least write-ups, but the ones who effectively
        identify their problems and correct them.

        1.1.3.2. The 80th Flying Training Wing Inspector General is designated the CCIP
        Director. The CCIP Director manages the program and uses a SharePoint site as a
        clearinghouse for processes, procedures, and information. The site can be found under
        “Inspector General” on the 80th Flying Training Wing SharePoint site.

1.2. Roles and Responsibilities.

    1.2.1. Wing Commander.

        tenant wing IG staff template with the exception that the MICT Manager and
        Inspection Superintendant will be filled as additional duties) (T-3).

        1.2.1.2. Approves all significant elements of the CCIP through the Commander’s
        Inspection Management Boards (CIMB). Approvals will be documented by the CCIP
        Director and maintained on the CCIP SharePoint site (T-3). Minimum items to be

                                                                                              6

1.4. Self-assessment Program.

1.4.1. The self-assessment program is primarily managed via the CCIP SharePoint site. The site
includes SAP manager and MICT administrator appointments, the annual schedule, a checklist
assignment matrix, business rules, and applicable publications. The wing SAP manager
manages the program by coordinating with subordinate SAP managers. The wing self-
assessment program is structured to extend to all wing units precluding the need for
independent subordinate programs.

        1.4.1.1. Locally developed self-assessment checklists (SACs). Each locally developed
        compliance publication should have an associated locally developed SAC in MICT. The
        publication OPR will develop an applicable SAC. The Wing SAP manager will be the
        approval authority in MICT for releasing a newly created SAC and properly assigning it
        in the checklist assignment matrix (T-3).

1.5. Wing IG inspections and exercises.

    1.5.1. The commander approved inspection/exercise schedule will be executed by the
    Director of Inspections. The director will determine the appropriate composition of the WIT
    for each event and develop a complete inspection plan defining the data collection methods
    and sources. Each WIT member will be given specific inspection instructions and the
    designated WIT will conduct a comprehensive internal brief prior to each inspection. The
    director will monitor the inspection/exercise progress and conduct a hot wash immediately
    following each event. A final report will be provided to the IG for approval. Approved
    reports will be maintained on the CCIP SharePoint site and presented to the applicable
    commanders (T-3).

    1.5.2. Integration with the 82 TRW self-assessment program and exercises. As a tenant unit
    on Sheppard AFB, the 80 FTW participates in several programs and exercises managed by
    the 82 TRW. For exercises, designated WIT members will augment the 82 WIT and
    evaluate the response of the 80 FTW. The exercise report will be produced by the 82 TRW
    and copies will be provided to the 80 FTW. For self-assessments of 82 TRW programs that
    the 80 FTW participates in, individuals will forward an exported PDF file of their most
    recent MICT SAC to the 82 TRW POC upon request. If the assessment occurred more than
    180 days ago, re-accomplish the SAC prior to forwarding (T-3).
