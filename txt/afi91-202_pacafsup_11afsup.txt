SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
provides administrative updates and changes the name of the 611th Air Support Group (611
ASG) to the Pacific Air Forces Regional Support Center (PRSC). Provides clarification of
inspection and assessment responsibilities and requirements for PRSC and 611th Air and Space
Operations Center (611 AOC). Forward Operating Bases (FOB), Long Range Radar Sites, Short
Range Radar Sites, Eareckson Air Station (AS), King Salmon AS, and Wake Island Airfield will
be addressed throughout this supplement as PRSC installations.
3.1.1. (Added) . The 673d Air Base Wing, Ground Safety, (673 ABW/SEG) is the host ground
safety office for 11 AF Headquarters Staff, PRSC, and 611 AOC. The 673 ABW/SEG will
conduct all required safety training (for example, Supervisor Safety Training (SST), Course II,
III, IV, V, and Unit Safety Representatives (USR)) for 11 AF and PRSC/611 AOC personnel.
The 673 ABW/SEG is responsible to conduct annual facility inspections for these units.
3.1.2. (Added) . The 3rd Wing, Weapons Safety division (3 WG/SEW) is the host weapons
safety office for 11 AF Headquarters and, when requested, serves as the numbered air force
subject matter expert in regards to 11 AF weapons safety inspections, waivers, exemptions,
deviations, site planning, and all other AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, AFI 91-
202, and AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, weapons safety responsibilities (NAF-
specific), to include Wake Island, Eareckson AS and other sites as determined by the 11 AF
Chief of Safety (11 AF/SE).
3.1.3. (Added) . Safety inspections of PRSC remote installations are the responsibility of the
611th Air Support Squadron/Quality Assurance (611 ASUS/QA), in conjunction with PRSC
installation contractors. The 11 AF/SE, and when appropriate the 673 ABW/SEG and 3 WG/
SEW, will conduct periodic visits to PRSC installations, in support of PRSC contracts. The
temporary duties (TDY) to fulfill PRSC-overseen contracts will be funded by PRSC. All other
TDYs to fulfill inspection and other 91-series requirements, not directly associated with PRSC
contracts, will be budgeted for and funded by 11 AF. As these remote facilities are government
owned, contractor operated, the inspection periodicity is at the discretion of the 11 AF Chief of
Safety, based on existing condition and potential risks. Periodic visits to FOB during active
flying deployments are desired.
3.4.1.1. (Added) . The 11 AF/SE, in lieu of the 673 ABW/SE, will perform program
management assessments on the PRSC and 611 AOC at 24-month intervals, or as prescribed by
the 11 AF/SE.
3.4.1.2. (Added) . The 611 ASUS/QA is the OPR for safety matters concerning contract
personnel at PRSC installations.
4.3.2.1. (Added) . Contract personnel at PRSC installations should report hazards concerning
government furnished equipment that cannot be eliminated immediately to 611 ASUS/QA
through the administrative contracting officer. Reported hazards will be relayed by the 611
ASUS/QA to 11 AF/SE.
4.3.2.2. (Added) . All hazard reports received by 11 AF pertaining to host or tenant facilities
will be forwarded to the host wing. All hazard reports pertaining to PRSC installations will be
tracked through the 673 ABW/SEG hazard reporting program.
AFI91-202_PACAFSUP_11AFSUP 4 APRIL 2014                                                          3


7.3.1.5.1.1. (Added) . The PRSC installations which are owned and operated by, or under
contract to, the United States Air Force (USAF) will be maintained in accordance with the
habitat guidelines as set forth in AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
Management Techniques. The PRSC installations may deviate from these guidelines when a
sound risk assessment indicates positive benefit from the deviation, or the cost of modification of
the existing habitat outweighs the potential decrease in risk. Any modifications or deviations
from the AFPAM 91-212 guidelines occurring at PRSC installations will be staffed by PRSC
through 11 AF/SE and approved by 11 AF/CV. Modification and deviation records, both
temporary and permanent, will be kept on file by PRSC, 11 AF/SE, and the applicable
installation. All current (as of the publication date) approved PRSC deviations are listed in
Attachment 18, this supplement.
7.3.1.5.1.2. (Added) . Each PRSC installation owned and operated by, or under contract to, the
USAF will establish a bird exclusion zone(s) (BEZ). The BEZ will be used as an aid in
determining the bird watch condition (BWC) and will incorporate the area in which both passive
and active harassment techniques will be employed. As a baseline, a BEZ should include a
1,000-foot buffer around all physical surfaces used for operation of USAF aircraft. The PRSC
installations will include a description of their BEZ in their Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard
(BASH) plans and may deviate from the baseline BEZ, based on documented risk management.
The PRSC installations which are owned and operated by, or under contract to, the USAF will
establish a BEZ for the purpose of declaring a BWC. Due to the infrequent operations at PRSC
installations, the passive and active harassment techniques used at PRSC installations need not
be employed on a continuing basis. Modifications or deviations to the baseline BEZ occurring at
PRSC installations will be staffed by PRSC through 11 AF/SE and approved by 11 AF/CV. All
current (as of the publication date) approved PRSC deviations are listed in Attachment 18, this
supplement.
7.3.1.5.1.3. (Added) . The PRSC installation BASH plans will be reviewed annually, prior to
the start of spring migration, by the PRSC program designee, and additionally approved by 11
AF/ SE. The PRSC BASH program will be managed in accordance with AFI 91-202. The 11
AF/ SEF will establish a Bird Hazard Working Group (BHWG) consisting of organizations
involved in airfield wildlife control, natural resources management, operations and safety. The
BHWG must meet at least semi-annually with minutes maintained. The PRSC/CC (or
equivalent) and the 611 AOC/CC will co-chair the meeting. The BHWG will coordinate base
improvement projects (for example, grounds maintenance, wastewater treatment, golf courses,
and so forth) for BASH-related issues.
7.3.1.5.1.4. (Added) . An accurate BWC MUST be declared before any flying operation may
occur at PRSC installations owned and operated by, under contract to the USAF. The meaning
of each BWC may be found in AFPAM 91-212. The criteria for declaring BWC MODERATE
are: concentrations of approximately 5 to 15 large birds (water fowl, gulls, ravens, or other birds
of similar (large) size), or approximately 15 to 30 small birds (starlings, sparrows, and so forth)
within the BEZ, but not meeting the SEVERE criteria. BWC SEVERE should be declared
when: any large bird or concentration of birds (including those in the MODERATE description)
are on or above the runway, in the arrival/departure routes, or are at concentration in the BEZ
greater than MODERATE.
7.3.1.5.1.5. (Added) . See Table 7.1, below, for BWCs following restrictions on aircraft
operations at PRSC locations:

*or equivalent (for example, AOC/CC)


7.3.1.5.1.6. (Added) . State, private, or leased airfields comply with Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) requirements for animal control and aircraft notification. Aircrew
operating on these fields should use any means available to obtain updated animal information
before landing/takeoff. The primary sources of information should be the control tower,
supervisor of flying (SOF) (if available), Base Operations Support Contractor, the appropriate
flight service station (FSS), and finally Universal Communications (UNICOM) with other
aircraft operating to/from the airfield. If satisfactory information cannot be obtained or the
information is of questionable accuracy, visually inspect the field before landing/taking off, if
conditions permit. Aircrew who experience problems obtaining satisfactory information at
contractor operated airfields should report the incident to 11 AF/SE.
7.3.1.5.1.7. (Added) . Operations into/from PRSC installations will comply with the following:
7.3.1.5.1.7.1. (Added) . At two-way sites, BWC MODERATE may warrant an over flight of
the field for visual inspection. If BWC SEVERE is called, aircraft will hold, situation
permitting, until the wildlife is dispersed.
7.3.1.5.1.7.2. (Added) . At one-way sites, airfield conditions must be briefed prior to passing
the point of commitment. If BWC MODERATE is called, the location of the wildlife, the
weather, and other factors will be considered before committing to land. If BWC SEVERE is
called the aircraft will hold, situation permitting, until the wildlife is dispersed.
7.3.1.5.1.7.3. (Added) . The 517th Airlift Squadron will maintain site videos on Cape
Newenham, Cape Romanzof, Sparrevohn, Indian Mountain, Tatalina, Cape Lisburne, and Tin
City. These videos help identify a unique hazards (optical illusions, terrain) and potential
locations for wildlife. Aircrew viewing of these videos is encouraged before a mission into one
of these sites.
8.12. (Added) . The PRSC and 611 AOC will: Comply with the host safety office
requirements and will receive the same safety services as wing subordinate units.
8.13. (Added) . The PRSC and 611 AOC will: Assist 673 ABW and 3 WG in the
investigation of unit mishaps. The 673 ABW and 3 WG are responsible for reporting mishaps.
AFI91-202_PACAFSUP_11AFSUP 4 APRIL 2014                                                  5


8.14. (Added) . The PRSC and 611 AOC will: Ensure primary and alternate USRs and Unit
Motorcycle Monitors (UMM) are appointed for their respective units. The appointed
representatives will maintain unit safety programs in accordance with host wing and MAJCOM
requirements. Forward the signed the appointment letter(s) to 11 AF/SEG and 673 ABW/SEG
and ensure both USRs and UMMs attend the required 673 ABW/SEG training. All on-base
tenant facilities will be inspected by the host wing annually (see paragraph 3.1.1, this
supplement).
9.13. (Added) . Any deployment to PRSC installations: involving explosives or live
munitions and not conducted in support of CDRNORAD CONPLAN 3310-12 MUST coordinate
explosive and munitions storage with 11 AF/SE and 3 WG/SEW, prior to conducting the
deployment.
9.14. (Added) . Currently, explosive site plans exist for Wake Island. Quantity-Distance
Safety Submissions, Explosives Safety Submissions, new construction, and any planned change
of use of existing structures at PRSC locations MUST be coordinated and approved by 11
AF/SE and 3 WG/SEW.
12.12. (Added) . Information Collections. No information collections are required by this
publication.
