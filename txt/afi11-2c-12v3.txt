                                             Chapter 2

                                  COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. Command and control of Air Force C-12 aircraft will be established by owning
MAJCOMs. When C-12 aircrews are supporting contingency operations outside their MAJCOM,
the aircrews will be informed by their owning MAJCOM what agency is vested with exercising
operational control. United States (US) Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, or the Civil Air
Patrol pilots/crew members flying Air Force owned C-12 aircraft will comply with this AFI.
   2.1.1. For the purposes of this regulation, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) is
   considered a MAJCOM and the Chief, DIA Air and Maritime Operations, is equivalent to an
   Air Force OG/CC.
2.2. Execution Authority. Execution authority for missions will be received through the local
command element. Commanders with execution authority formulate plans, allocate assets, and
approve PICs to carry out directed or training missions through a local command post or
Command and Control (C2) element. OG/CCs serve as execution authority for local training
missions. Squadron Commanders (SQ/CCs) or their designated representatives assign airlift
missions to PICs. PICs hold execution authority for missions operating outside normal
communication channels (use last known mission orders or best course of action).
   2.2.1. Off-Station Trainers (OST). Approval authority is the Wing Commander (WG/CC)
   but may be delegated to the OG/CC.
   2.2.2. Supplemental Training Mission (STM). Opportune airlift of cargo and mission
   personnel may be accomplished as a by-product of crew training missions. The training
   mission will not be degraded in any manner to accomplish the STM.
2.3. Pilot in Command Responsibility and Authority. Unit commanders shall designate an
Aircraft Commander (AC), Instructor Pilot (IP), or Evaluator Pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights
on a flight authorization form IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management. An unqualified or non-
mission ready (NMR) pilot may not be designated as PIC. PICs are:
      2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.3.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only fly
   events authorized in the mission tasking unless in the PIC’s judgment an emergency
   condition demands otherwise.
   2.3.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority.
   2.3.4. The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
   2.3.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports to C2 agents.
   2.3.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel
   and will establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior to entering
   crew rest.
   2.3.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Ground Personnel
   (MEGP), passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
   2.3.8. Responsible for ensuring all passengers are manifested properly.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                   13


2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. When conditions do not warrant starting or continuing a
mission, the executing agency or the PIC may decide to delay a mission. If the PIC refuses a
mission, the mission will not depart until the conditions have been corrected or improved so that
the mission can operate safely. Another PIC will not be tasked to take the same mission under
the same conditions.
2.5. Aircrew Responsibilities. The local C2 agency is the focal point for all mission support
activities. The PIC must inform C2 of any factor that may affect mission accomplishment. When
transiting a stop without a C2 agency, the PIC is responsible for ensuring necessary mission
information is placed into the C2 system by the most expeditious means available.
2.6. Operational C2 Reporting. All units will establish C2 reporting procedures and
requirements. Aircrews on operational missions will transmit an arrival advisory to the
destination C2 when applicable.
2.7. Mission Commander. A mission commander shall be designated when two or more
aircraft are assembled to execute a mission. The mission commander is accountable for mission
execution and will ensure all pre/post mission coordination is accomplished.
2.8. Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the DoD to cooperate with civilian law
enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-801, Assistance to Civilian
Law Enforcement Agencies, provides the policies and procedures service members must follow
when supporting federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement agencies. Coordinate all
civilian law enforcement authorities’ requests for assistance through appropriate C2 channels.

                                            Chapter 3

                                 AIRCREW MANAGEMENT

3.1. Aircrew Qualification. Primary crewmembers or those occupying a primary position
during flight must be qualified or in training for qualification. If noncurrent, or in training for a
particular event, the crewmember must be under the supervision of an instructor while
accomplishing that event (direct supervision for critical phases of flight).
3.2. Pilots:
   3.2.1. Missions With Passengers. Ensure pilot qualifications are IAW AFI 11-401 paragraph
   1.12. Touch-and-go landings with passengers on board are prohibited.
   3.2.2. Training Sorties. Ensure crew composition is IAW AFI 11-401. Mission qualification
   training and mission evaluations may be conducted on missions with passengers on board
   provided the individual in training possesses a current AF Form 8 for basic aircraft
   qualification.
3.3. Crew Composition. Minimum crew complement is one AC and another pilot.
3.4. Additional Crewmember (ACM). Unit commanders will comply with AFI 11-401 when
granting ACM status. All ACMs require valid orders annotated with ACM authority.
   3.4.1. Units will coordinate planned ACMs with the controlling agency. Duty passengers,
   once scheduled by the controlling agent or manifested, will not be displaced by ACM
   travelers.
3.5. Mission-Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP). MEGP status is granted to certain
individuals performing unique support duties directly associated with and essential to a particular
aircraft, aircrew, or mission. MEGP authority must be on the individual’s orders or other written
authorization.
3.6. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Operating Procedures. Pilot rated senior staff members
(DV7s or above) who have completed a familiarization course may occupy either pilot seat under
direct IP supervision. These individuals will log ―OP‖ for flight authorization duty code on the
Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
Do not carry passengers while conducting Senior Staff Familiarization Flights unless the senior
staff member possesses a current AF Form8 for basic aircraft qualification.
3.7. Alerting Procedures. C-12 Aircrews will normally self-alert. If C2 will accomplish the
alert then the PIC must be informed prior to the start of crew rest and will notify the crew.
   3.7.1. C2 Alerts. Aircrew alert time is normally 3+00 hours before scheduled takeoff time
   (allows 1 hour for reporting and 2+00 hours for mission preparation). Individual locations
   may increase or decrease this time depending on specific capabilities.
       3.7.1.1. The PIC may arrange an alert time that provides additional preparation time to
       accomplish the mission. The PIC may also accept alerting with reduced preparation time
       when the mission allows. In all cases, the PIC shall coordinate changes to standard
       alerting times with the appropriate C2 agency.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                       15


       3.7.1.2. C2 agents shall not alert an aircrew until the aircraft is in commission or there is
       reasonable assurance that maintenance technicians will complete repairs that allow the
       aircrew time to pre-flight and load the aircraft to meet the target takeoff time.
       3.7.1.3. C2 agents shall not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-3
       status until maintenance technicians determine required parts are available and the
       aircraft will be repaired within the target ground time.
   3.7.2. Aircrew Release. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
       3.7.2.1. On the aircrew’s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2 agent,
       or PIC during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
       3.7.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected alert
       time. The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or 12
       hours when flying in deadhead status. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to
       accept more than the 6 hour window.
       3.7.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting
       during the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time,
       the C2 agent will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12 hours
       from the time of notification.
       3.7.2.4. At the end of the legal for alert window, the PIC will contact a C2 agent and
       establish a new expected alert time.
3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. IAW AFI 11-202V3. In addition, SQ/CCs shall not schedule an
aircrew member to fly nor will an aircrew member perform aircrew duties when using nasal
sprays to treat symptoms of head congestion existing before flight unless specifically cleared by
a flight surgeon.
3.9. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP is the time period between mission reporting and final
aircraft engine shutdown. FDP for C-12 crewmembers is 16 hours.
   3.9.1. Maximum FDP is 12 hours when flying without an operative autopilot pitch axis. Do
   not takeoff with an inoperative autopilot if the planned flight duration will exceed a 12 hour
   FDP. Crews may exceed the 12 hour FDP restriction if the autopilot failed after takeoff and
   the flight duration exceeds the 12 hour FDP restriction.
   3.9.2. Maximum FDP for training missions is 14 hours. Do not conduct practice instrument
   approaches, touch and go landings, or conduct simulated emergency procedures after 12
   hours of FDP.
   3.9.3. Deadhead time is the time for crewmembers in passenger or ACM status, positioning
   or depositioning for a mission or mission support function. Crewmembers may perform
   primary crew duties after deadheading if they will not exceed their FDP which began at
   reporting time for the deadhead flight. Crewmembers may deadhead following primary crew
   duties if they will not exceed a 24-hour FDP beginning at reporting time for primary crew
   duties.
3.10. Crew Rest. The minimum crew rest period is 12 hours. Should the 12-hour crew rest
period be infringed upon by official duties, the crew will be afforded an additional 10 hours crew
rest on completion of the official duties.
 16                                                           AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008


   3.10.1. Home Station Predeparture Crew Rest. All primary and deadhead crewmembers
   should enter crew rest 24 hours prior to reporting time for missions scheduled away from
   home station for more than 16 hours. Crewmembers may perform non-flying duties,
   including mission planning, during the first 12 hours of this period. For all other missions,
   crew rest is IAW 11-202V3.
   3.10.2. En Route Crew Rest and Ground Time. Crew rest begins after all crewmembers have
   completed all post flight duties.
   3.10.3. Reentering Crew Rest. PICs are granted the authority to reenter crew rest if their
   aircraft or mission (training or operational) is not capable of departure within 4 hours from
   scheduled takeoff time. The PIC shall evaluate delay circumstances (maintenance ETIC, WX
   forecasts, crew ORM, mission priority, expected duty day, etc.) and inform execution
   authority of intent to reenter crew rest.
   3.10.4. Post-Mission Crew Rest. Crewmembers returning to their home base will be given
   sufficient time to recover from the cumulative effects of the mission and tend to personal
   needs. Crew rest begins immediately on mission termination. Waiver authority for post-
   mission crew rest will not be delegated below the OG/CC.
       3.10.4.1. One hour of post-mission crew rest time (up to a maximum of 72 hours) will be
       provided for each 3 hours Temporary Duty (TDY) to crewmembers gone from home
       station more than 24 hours. This time is in addition to and will not run concurrently with
       predeparture crew rest.
3.11. Standby Force Duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not
later than 18 hours prior to Legal For Alert time. This allows crewmembers 12 hours of pre-
standby crew rest and 6 hours for aircraft pre-flight duty. When aircrews are unable to complete
all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show time, provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby
crew rest. If MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall
place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest. SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in ALFA/BRAVO
status up to 48 hours. MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend this period for contingencies. After 48
hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12 hour pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may
provide additional local procedures for management of Standby Force Duties.
   3.11.1. ALFA Standby Aircraft Preflight Generation and Security. When tasked, SQ/CC
   shall posture an aircraft and aircrew as an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour.
   The following procedures apply to primary aircraft as well as spare aircraft generated for
   ALFA alerts. A maintenance Dash -6 and aircrew Dash -1 preflight must be completed.
   Preflight validity will be in accordance with applicable T.O. After the preflight, the PIC will
   notify the controlling agency. The aircraft will remain in a sealed posture and be referred to
   as ―cocked on alert‖. Documentation of when the aircraft was cocked on alert must be placed
   in the forms. The PIC will ensure the aircraft is secure before entering crew rest. Secure all
   hatches and doors to show unauthorized entry. Close and lock the crew entrance door with
   the key, which will prevent entry without damage to the door or lock. The aircrew preflight
   portion remains valid if performed by one crew, cocked on alert, and launched by another
   crew. Uncocking a generated aircraft is not a standard procedure but may be accomplished
   on a case by case basis. The PIC or a designated aircrew representative must be present if
   access to the aircraft is required. Ensure command and control and the controlling agency are
   notified when uncocking and recocking generated aircraft. Follow-on pre-flights done during
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                    17


   normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest. Begin FDP when C2 agent directs the
   aircrew to launch from crew rest or while performing pre-flight (begin FDP when the aircrew
   arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-flight).
   3.11.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and/or
   aircrew in BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 2 hours of unit notification.
   Follow-on pre-flights, if required, interrupt crew rest. Begin FDP when aircrew shows for
   duty.
   3.11.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a
   CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be
   legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE
   status up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, release aircrews from CHARLIE Standby or enter them
   into 12 hours crew rest for directed mission, training mission, or subsequent Standby Force
   duty.
   3.11.4. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a 12
   hour pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be able
   to launch within 2 hours of unit notification. After 12 hours, launch, release, or re-enter
   aircrews in 12 hour crew rest period before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty. NOTE:
   OG/CCs should develop local procedures for management of Standby Force Duties.
   3.11.5. Post-Standby Missions. On completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be
   dispatched on a mission. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start
   of pre-departure crew rest. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the
   post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time.
   3.11.6. Post Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following
   standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
       3.11.6.1. If standby duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is
       computed from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
       3.11.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
       authorized.
3.12. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. IAW with DoD 4515.13-R, Air
Transportation Eligibility, AFI 11-401, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
3.13. Inter-fly. Inter-fly is the exchange and/or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft
between commands. A formal inter-fly agreement is not required for an aircrew member that
occasionally acts as ―guest help.‖ Inter-fly involving the transfer of aircraft between MAJCOMs
must be coordinated and approved through the MAJCOM OPR.
   3.13.1. Each affected OG/CC who commits resources (personnel or aircraft) must concur
   with the inter-fly proposal. The inter-fly agreement will detail all training and qualification
   requirements.

                                           Chapter 4

                        AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. Redundant systems may allow crews to safely perform some missions when a
component/system is degraded. The PIC is the final authority in determining the overall
suitability of an aircraft for the mission. The PIC will ensure a detailed explanation of the
discrepancy is entered in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document;
include the following maintenance identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft status.
   4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component essential for safe aircraft operation as ME.
   4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component, which is not currently essential for safe aircraft operation as MC. These
   discrepancies should be cleared at the earliest opportunity. If circumstances change or
   mission safety would be compromised, re-designate as ME. Do not delay a mission to clear a
   MC discrepancy.
   4.1.3. Open Item (OI). The PIC will designate discrepancies not expected to adversely
   impact the current mission or any subsequent mission as an OI. These items are normally
   cleared at home station.
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. The MEL catalogues the minimum
equipment/systems required to operate the aircraft. It is impractical to prepare a list that would
anticipate all possible combinations of equipment malfunctions and contingent circumstances.
Consider equipment/systems with no listed exceptions as grounding items. A PIC who accepted
an aircraft with degraded equipment/systems is not committed to subsequent operations with the
same degraded equipment. PICs are not committed to operations with degraded equipment
accepted by another PIC.
   4.2.1. The PIC shall account for the possibility of additional failures during continued
   operation with inoperative systems or components. The MEL is not intended for continued
   operation over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.
   4.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted by mission
   requirements/directives.
   4.2.3. Waiver Policy. A PIC desiring to operate with a degraded item required to be
   functional by the MEL shall request a waiver. The PIC shall provide: 1) nature of request, 2)
   individual crew member qualification, 3) mission leg(s) requiring the waiver, and 4) the
   governing directive of waiver request to include volume, chapter, or paragraph.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. MEL waiver authority is as follows:
   4.3.1. Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority.
   4.3.2. Operational Missions. MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority.
   4.3.3. Contingency Missions. Director of Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR) (or equivalent)
   for the agency with C2, if not specified in the Operations Order (OPORD)/Tasking Order.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                       19


   4.3.4. If beyond C2 communication capability, and when faced with exigent circumstances,
   the PIC may deviate from the MEL and this chapter. Report deviations (without waiver)
   IAW this AFI paragraph 1.4 NOTE: When the PIC assumes waiver authority under
   ―exigent circumstances‖, the PIC shall exercise sound judgment and apply risk management
   principals to the decision making process.
   4.3.5. One-time Flight Clarification. Normally a Red X discrepancy is downgraded for a
   one-time flight. This condition does not preclude carrying cargo and passengers, unless
   restricted by the authority who downgraded the Red X. The priority is to move the airplane to
   a repair capable facility. PICs must coordinate with appropriate agencies to ensure repair
   capability exists at the destination. One-time flights may include en route technical stops only
   when necessary to recover the airplane.
4.4. Technical Assistance. The PIC may request technical support and additional assistance
from their home unit or MAJCOM A3V.
4.5. MEL Procedural Guidance. The Technical Order (T.O.) 1C-12(A/F/J)-1, Flight Manual,
Chapter 5 provides the C-12 MEL. The MEL lists aircraft equipment and systems considered
essential for safe flight. When the PIC considers an item essential that is not covered by this list,
that item will be treated as if it is included. The T.O. 1C-12(A/F/J)-1 MEL does not include the
Minimum Essential Subsystems List (MESL) which is maintained by the maintenance
contractor.
   4.5.1. Warning and Caution annunciator lights not specifically referenced in the MEL should
   be operative.
   4.5.2. Crews will refer to MAJCOM or unit policy regarding engine exceedance, when a
   recording system is installed. In the absence of MAJCOM or unit policy, land as soon as
   practical when an engine limit exceedance has been recorded. A maintenance supervisor will
   determine the course of action required and the disposition of the aircraft.
4.6. Gear Down Flight Operations. Limit gear down flight operations to sorties required to
move the aircraft to a suitable repair facility. Consider gear down flight only after the PIC
exhausts all avenues to repair the aircraft in place.

                               OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. A checklist is not complete until all items have been accomplished. Momentary
hesitations for coordination items, air traffic control (ATC) interruptions and deviations specified
in the flight manual, etc., are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures or limitations
may be added to the checklists (in pencil only). Currency of notes is a crewmember’s
responsibility.
   5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. MAJCOM Stan/Eval will approve the use of checklist inserts IAW
   AFI 11-215. The inserts should be placed at the end of the appropriate checklist or in an in-
   flight guide. All checklist inserts must have a POC. Operations Group Stan/Eval (OGV) shall
   approve local in-flight guides and inserts not affecting T.O. guidance and procedures.
5.2. Duty Station. Both pilots shall be in their seats during flight. One of the pilots may be out
of their seat for brief periods to meet physiological needs and crew duties. With both pilots in
their seats, PICs may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying a primary duty station during
non-critical phases of flight (the other pilot will be awake and alert). Comply with AFI 11-202V3
oxygen requirements when one pilot is out of the seat.
5.3. Flight Station Entry. Passengers and observers will not be permitted access to primary
crew positions.
5.4. Landings With Emergency. A qualified aircraft commander will accomplish the landing
during actual emergency conditions unless specific conditions dictate otherwise.
5.5. DV-2 Missions. DV-2 or higher missions require an experienced aircraft commander
(EAC) certified by the unit commander as highly experienced or certified as an instructor to be
the PIC. EACs must have 200 hours primary assigned aircraft (―other‖ time excluded) after
certification as an AC. A qualified EAC or higher will make all takeoffs and landings on these
missions.
5.6. Seatbelts. All occupants must have an assigned seat with a seatbelt. Use of seatbelts will be
as directed by the PIC and the flight manual.
   5.6.1. Infants, 2 years old or younger, may be carried in the lap of the parent or guardian but
   will have a separate seat assigned (see para 13.4.1.1 and 13.4.2). Separate flotation devices
   and oxygen sources are required.
   5.6.2. Both pilots will have the lap belt fastened at all times in flight and while taxiing the
   aircraft, unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
   5.6.3. All crewmembers will have seatbelts and shoulder harnesses fastened during takeoff
   and landing unless crew duties dictate otherwise.

5.9. Tobacco Use on Air Force Aircraft. Tobacco use of any type is prohibited on C-12
aircraft.
5.10. Advisory Calls The pilot flying (PF) will periodically announce intentions during
departures, arrivals, approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from normal
procedures. The pilot not flying (PNF) will monitor PF actions and maintain situational
awareness at all times (see note 3). Table 5.1 through Table 5.5 depict mandatory calls for non-
precision approaches, precision approaches, climbout, descent, and landing respectively.

NOTES:
1. The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land or go-around. If the runway
environment is not in sight and/or the aircraft is not in position for a normal landing, a go-around
will be made.
2. The pilot may continue to 100 feet height above touchdown (HAT) with reference to the
approach lights. The pilot may not descend below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation
(TDZE) referencing only the approach lights unless the red terminating bars or the red side row
bars are distinctly visible and identifiable.
3. The PNF will announce "100" and "50" at 100 and 50 feet HAT, as indicated on the radar
altimeter. The PNF shall assess aircraft glide path and call "go around" if the sink rate is
excessive or the aircraft will land short of the runway.
4. If the aircraft is equipped with a Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) that is
configured to automatically provide the 100 feet and 50 feet callouts, the PNF is not required to
voice these calls.

   5.10.1. Anytime an altitude or altimeter setting is changed when operating in a non-standard
   configuration, both pilots will verify the units of measure. A standard configuration is
   defined as the units of measure the pilots are accustomed to operating with.
5.11. Deviations. The PNF will announce when heading or airspeed deviations are observed, or
when the altitude is more than 100 feet from assigned and the PF is not attempting to correct the
deviation. PF will acknowledge the deviation.
   5.11.1. Any crewmember observing an altitude more than 200 feet from assigned or a
   decrease of 10 knots airspeed from desired or a potential terrain/obstruction conflict will
   immediately notify the PF. PF will acknowledge the warning.
5.12. Communications Policy. The Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to
aircrews regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to
maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
   5.12.1. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and
   mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and other critical phases of
   flight.
   5.12.2. Command Radios. The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is
   primary, and update the crew when the primary radio changes.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                     23


      5.12.2.1. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard emergency frequencies to the
      maximum extent possible.
      5.12.2.2. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of
      unauthorized frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training.
   5.12.3. Crew Resource Management (CRM) Assertive Statement. "Time Out" is the
   common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. The use of "Time Out" will:
      5.12.3.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness.
      5.12.3.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
      5.12.3.3. Notify all crewmembers when someone sees the crew departing from
      established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply uncomfortable
      with the developing conditions.
   5.12.4. As soon as possible after a "Time Out" has been called, the PIC will:
      5.12.4.1. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft.
      5.12.4.2. Allow the initiating crewmember to voice their concerns.
      5.12.4.3. The PIC will seek other crewmembers inputs relative to the stated concerns.
      5.12.4.4. After considering all inputs, the PIC will announce a course of action.
5.13. Transportation of Pets. Transporting dogs and cats in conjunction with the sponsor’s
permanent change of station is authorized. Refer to DoD 4515.13R for rules governing the
transporting of other pets.
5.14. Alcoholic Beverages. Dispensing of alcoholic beverages is IAW AFI 34-219, Alcoholic
Beverage Program.
5.15. Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements.
   5.15.1. Minimum Runway Length For Takeoff and Landings. Crews will determine aircraft
   takeoff and landing data (TOLD) performance from the flight manual or MAJCOM approved
   tab data. Field length available must exceed the longest of computed Accel After Liftoff to
   35 feet (Accel Go), Accel Stop computed without reverse corrected for RCR plus 500 feet, or
   landing distance computed without reverse over a 50 foot obstacle corrected for RCR plus
   500 feet.
      5.15.1.1. Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, the PF will initiate takeoffs from the
      beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway. The decision to make
      intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC. Runway remaining from the intersection
      will be as required in paragraphs 5.15.1 Pilots may accomplish intersection takeoffs
      provided the operating environment (i.e., gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria,
      weather, etc.) allows a safe takeoff and departure. Calculate takeoff performance based
      on the runway remaining from the point at which the takeoff is initiated.
      5.15.1.2. Minimum runway length for touch-and-go landings is 5,000 feet [1,524 meters]
      for C/D/F models and 6,000 feet [1,830 meters] for J models.
   5.15.2. During operations on runways partially covered with snow or ice, base takeoff
   computations on the reported Runway Surface Condition (RSC) or RCR for the cleared
24                                                           AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008


  portion of the runway. A minimum of 25 feet either side of centerline should be cleared. If 25
  feet either side of centerline is not cleared, compute takeoff data based on the uncleared
  portion.
  5.15.3. Use of Overruns. If overruns are available, properly stressed, and authorized for
  normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff or landing.
  5.15.4. Minimum Runway Width. Minimum runway width is 60 feet. EXCEPTION: DIA
  and Defense Security Cooperative Agency (DSCA) austere airfield qualified pilots may use
  runways less than 60 feet wide with HQ DIA/DHO-AM approval.
  5.15.5. Arresting Cables. Land beyond the approach end arresting cable(s) unless runway
  length is critical.
     5.15.5.1. Do not takeoff or land over a cable that has been reported as slack, loose, or
     improperly rigged.
     5.15.5.2. The PIC is authorized to use the entire length of the runway if conditions
     (aircraft gross weight, runway length, weather, winds, takeoff and landing data (TOLD),
     etc.) preclude taxiing forward of the approach end cable. The PIC will be aware that
     operations over arresting gear cables at speeds greater than taxi speed may result in
     damage to the brake assembly. NOTE: If an aircraft rolls over an arresting cable at
     greater than taxi speed the crew will make an AFTO 781A write-up requesting
     maintenance inspection of brake assembly.
 5.15.6. Other Airfield Requirements. Aircrews will review AMC’s Airfield Suitability
 Restrictions Report (ASRR) and supplemental theater information file (STIF) prior to off-
 station operations. The ASRR is not restrictive to C-12s but the PIC should use the
 information presented to improve situational awareness and aid risk management. Lack of an
 airfield’s inclusion in the ASRR does not preclude operations to that airfield, however, all
 other available publications concerning that airfield must be referenced by the PIC to ensure
 safe operations.
  5.15.7. RCR Limitations. If a value is not reported, use RCR 12 for wet runways and RCR 6
  for icy runways. Conversions from other braking action standards to RCR should be IAW
  DoD FLIP documents. Normally, RCR values are not reported for taxiways and ramps.
  During periods of reported low RCR, the taxiways and ramps may have an even lower RCR
  than reported for the runway. The runway surface should be considered wet when water on
  the runway causes a reflective glare.
     5.15.7.1. Do not use runways/taxiways with a reported RCR value less than 6.
     EXCEPTION: OG/CC may authorize crews to taxi on taxiways with a reported RCR
     value of 3 or greater.
  5.15.8. Wind Limitations. Airfields will be considered below minimums for takeoff and
  landing when winds (including gusts) are greater than:
     5.15.8.1. Maximum wind (any direction) – 50 knots.
     5.15.8.2. Maximum tailwind component – 10 knots.
     5.15.8.3. Maximum crosswinds – reference Table 5.6
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                   25

5.16. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage
(FOD) Avoidance.
   5.16.1. Taxi distance from obstructions is IAW AFI 11-218 and MAJCOM supplements.
   5.16.2. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the
   potential for engine FOD. Crews will carefully review taxi routes, turn requirements, and
   areas for potential FOD.
   5.16.3. Reverse Taxi. The aircraft may be backed, using reverse, when no other means of
   moving the aircraft is available or when required for familiarization during qualification
   training. This procedure will not be used at any time for the purpose of preventing delays
   when towing equipment is available or when other aircraft or equipment can be moved to
   provide adequate taxi clearance. Pilots shall exercise extreme caution during reverse taxi
   operations. Ensure a marshaller is present for all reverse taxi operations. CAUTION: Prop
   Blast during ground operations is capable of causing injury to ground personnel and damage
   to other aircraft, flight line equipment, and airport facilities.
5.17. Short Field Operations. MAJCOMs may authorize specially trained and certified pilots
to operate at air fields that do not meet the minimum runway length/width requirement. Units
conducting short field operations will comply with the following:
   5.17.1. A short-field qualified pilot will make the takeoff and landing.
   5.17.2. Operations are limited to daytime.
   5.17.3. Minimum runway length for takeoff is the computed takeoff distance (including
   climb to 50 feet) plus 500 feet.
   5.17.4. Minimum landing distance will be computed ground roll corrected for RCR without
   reverse plus 500 feet. WARNING: Mission Execution Authority shall be aware of the
   elevated risk associated with short field operations. Approving crews to utilize short field
   procedures authorizes crews to conduct operations with less than critical field length
   performance (Category III operations).
5.18. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action. As a minimum, unit commanders must implement the following
procedures:
   5.18.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.
       5.18.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.
       5.18.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate - Takeoffs and landings allowed only when
       departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
       and Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic pattern activity is prohibited.
 26                                                           AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008


      5.18.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe - All takeoffs and landings are prohibited.
      Waiver authority is OG/CC.
   5.18.2. OG/CCs establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of
   migratory bird activity. Schedulers shall make every effort to not schedule takeoffs or
   landings from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the Phase II period.
   5.18.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, PICs have the authority
   to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to observed/reported bird activity.
   5.18.4. Consider bird migratory patterns during the en route portion of the mission to help
   minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on HQ
   AFSC/SEF website contains BASH information including regionalized Continental United
   States (CONUS) bird migration patterns, Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) software
   overlay, and the latest news. The Avian Hazard Advisory system (AHAS) website is another
   source for real time bird hazard information. See AFPAM 91-212, Bird Aircraft Strike
   Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques, for additional information. The information
   derived from BASH computer models, although not restrictive, provides additional planning
   information and is useful when determining transition or low altitude training locations.
   5.18.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit to have the
   aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Bird strike damage cannot be
   accurately assessed in-flight, and undetected damage may result in a complex airborne
   emergency; only qualified maintenance personnel, on the ground, can make reliable damage
   assessments. Aircrews should not change the aircraft configuration until it has been
   determined that it is safe to do so. However, PIC judgment will prevail in any situation
   concerning safety of the aircrew and aircraft.
5.19. Functional Check Flights (FCFs) and Acceptance Check Flights (ACFs). Perform
FCFs and ACFs IAW T.O. 1-1-300, Acceptance/Functional Check Flight and Maintenance OPR
Checks, specific MDS FCF guidance (-6CF), AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance
Management, and applicable MAJCOM directives. Crews should only perform tasks or functions
contained in specific T.O. guidance. If requested to perform a non-standard function, PICs
should contact their OG/CC to see if an FCF applies.
   5.19.1. FCFs are performed after accomplishing inspections or maintenance to assure the
   aircraft is airworthy and capable of mission accomplishment.
   5.19.2. ACFs specify guidelines for accepting depot aircraft and determine compliance with
   contractual requirements .
   5.19.3. FCF Restrictions. IAW T.O. 1-1-300.
   5.19.4. The OG/CC is responsible for the FCF program. The OG/CC may authorize a partial
   FCF to check only those systems affected by maintenance, an inspection or modification.
   5.19.5. In accordance with T.O. 1C-12(A/F/J)-6CF-1, Functional Check Flight Procedures,
   conditions requiring an FCF include (but are not limited to) major retrofit modifications,
   removal or replacement of moveable flight control surfaces, major repairs that would affect
   the flying characteristics of the aircraft, adjustment, removal or replacement of major
   components of the flight control system for which airworthiness cannot be verified by
   maintenance operational checks, or removal or replacement of both engines.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                     27


   5.19.6. The approval authority to combine an FCF and ferry flight is the MAJCOM/A3/DO.
5.20. Participation in Aerial Events. See AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures,
and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement. AFI 11-209 identifies events sanctioned for support,
specifies the approval authority for each type, and stipulates that units participating in aerial
events will ensure activities are coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
through the regional AF representative.
5.21. Traffic Alert and Collision System (TCAS). IAW AFI 11-202 V3. An operable TCAS
does not relieve pilots from searching for/avoiding traffic utilizing other means (visual, radio).
5.22. Radio Altimeter. Before departure, set the radio altimeter for emergency return.
Normally, use the HAT or height above aerodrome (HAA) for instrument meteorological
conditions (IMC), or 400 feet for visual meteorological conditions (VMC) departures.
5.23. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews will not normally attempt to
recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi. Ground
crews will accomplish aircraft recovery. Unless an emergency dictates otherwise, aircrews may
only accomplish recovery if there is no aircraft damage, the surface will support the aircraft, and
the PIC has coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM maintenance authorities.
5.24. Vision 1. For aircraft equipped with Vision 1, crews may display Vision 1 on the pilot’s
Primary Flight Display (PFD) only during day, VMC conditions for situational awareness and
orientation only.

Section 6A—Pre-Mission

6.1. Aircrew Uniform.
   6.1.1. Aircrew will wear the aircrew uniform, as outlined in AFI 36-2903, Dress and
   Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement, on
   all missions, unless otherwise directed. When the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) requires
   civilian attire, dress conservatively.
   6.1.2. OG/CCs will determine clothing and equipment to be worn or carried aboard all
   flights commensurate with mission, climate, and terrain involved.
      6.1.2.1. See AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Life Support (ALS) Program, Attachment 1 for
      minimum aircrew clothing requirements. All crewmembers will have fire resistant (such
      as Nomex®) gloves in their possession.
      6.1.2.2. Crewmembers will remove rings and scarves before performing aircrew duties.
6.2. Personal Requirements.
   6.2.1. Passport. Crewmembers and passengers should carry a current passport on missions
   flown outside the United States. See Foreign Clearance Guide for specific requirements.
   6.2.2. PHS-731, International Certificates of Vaccination. Crewmembers and passengers
   should carry shot records on missions flown outside the United States. Ensure host and
   transiting country immunization requirements are met.
   6.2.3. FOD Hazards. Crewmembers will not wear wigs, hair pieces, rings, ornaments, pins,
   clips, other hair fasteners, or earrings in the aircraft or on the flight line. EXCEPTION:
   Crewmembers may wear plain elastic hair fasteners and or barrettes. These fasteners must
   not interfere with the wearing of headsets or the donning of oxygen equipment and will be
   accounted for before and after flight.
   6.2.4. Hearing Protection. Hearing protection should be worn when personnel are working
   near hazardous noise-producing sources.
   6.2.5. Flashlights. Each crewmember must carry an operable flashlight on night flights.
   6.2.6. Reflective Belt. Each crewmember shall wear a reflective belt on the flight line during
   hours of darkness or periods of reduced visibility unless directed otherwise.
6.3. Pre-Mission Actions.
   6.3.1. Crewmembers departing their local operating area will (at a minimum):
      6.3.1.1. Review FLIP, Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), OPORD, Special Instructions
      (SPINS), Operational Risk Assessment, and Country Risk Assessment as applicable.
      6.3.1.2. Review Airspace classification, Global Decision Support System (GDSS or
      GDSS2), ASRR, Giant Report and Airport Qualification Program (AQP) (if available).
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                      29


       6.3.1.3. Review the FCG for areas of operation (to include classified portion). Obtain
       necessary diplomatic clearances where required.

   6.3.5. Obtain worldwide FLIP and sufficient communications security (COMSEC) materials
   for the duration of the mission.
   6.3.6. Ensure physiological training, annual physical, immunizations, and flight evaluations
   will remain current for all crewmembers throughout the TDY period.
   6.3.7. Ensure visas have been received, if required.
   6.3.8. Obtain terrain charts for unfamiliar destinations, if available.
   6.3.9. Coordinate with C2 agency to release available seats. If the PIC releases seats at a
   location without a passenger terminal, a crewmember will need to perform the passenger
   service functions. These functions include manifesting, anti-hijacking processing, and
   ensuring visa/passport requirements are met. File a copy of the passenger manifest with the
   most responsible on-scene agency.
6.4. Aircrew Publication Requirements. Crewmembers will have access to the following

   followed by the five-digit aircraft number (example, EVAC 12345) or mission designator.
   Refer to FLIP General Procedures (GP) Chapter 4. When the AE portion of the mission is
   completed, normal call signs will be used.
   6.12.3. Search and Rescue. On actual search, rescue, and recovery missions, use the call sign
   ―Air Force Rescue‖ plus the last five digits of the aircraft tail number.
6.13. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent
possible without unacceptable mission degradation.
6.14. Flight Plan/Data Verification. Use computer flight plans (CFP) to the maximum extent
practical. The PIC has final responsibility for flight plan accuracy and diplomatic clearance
compliance. Advanced CFP (ACFP) and PFPS are approved CFP software. NOTE: MAJCOMs
may approve additional flight planning software as required.
6.15. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1, Instrument Flight
Procedures, this chapter, and appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Compute TOLD using T.O.
1C-12(A/F/J)-1, T.O. 1C-12(A/F/J)-1CL-1, and/or OGV-approved performance data extracts.
All TOLD computations should be verified by both pilots.
   6.15.1. VFR Departures. VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle clearance
   planning.
 32                                                           AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008


       6.15.1.1. VFR departures to an IFR minimum enroute altitude (MEA) or minimum safe
       altitude (MSA) are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure method for the
       airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure methods contained
       in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1 or when operational requirements dictate (i.e.
       tactical necessity). A VFR climb to an IFR MEA/MSA is only to be used as a last resort
       when the mission priority dictates increased risk. This guidance does not apply to planned
       VFR training or operational flights where the majority of the flight is to be conducted
       under VFR. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain
       are avoided.
       6.15.1.2. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by
       ensuring all the following conditions are met:
           6.15.1.2.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the
           departure route.
           6.15.1.2.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure or
           emergency return route provides obstacle avoidance. NOTE: If unable to comply
           with any of the above conditions, download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable
           conditions exist.
       6.15.1.3. Refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR outside the
       United States.
       6.15.1.4. When departing VFR, maintain VFR cloud clearances until obtaining an IFR
       clearance.
   6.15.2. IFR Departures. Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined in
   AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1.
       6.15.2.1. An IFR departure is not authorized at airfields without an instrument approach.
       6.15.2.2. Comply with all climb gradient guidance in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-
       217V1 for all engines operating (AEO) and OEI.
       6.15.2.3. C-12 aircrews are permitted to subtract 48 feet/nautical mile (ft/nm) (0.8%)
       from the published climb gradient to compute OEI requirements when the mission
       priority justifies the increased risk. NOTE: If the requirements of AFI 11-202V3 and
       AFMAN 11-217V1 cannot be met, download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable
       conditions exist.
6.16. Weather Minimums for Takeoff. Minimum Runway Visual Range (RVR) for takeoff is
1600 feet. If RVR is not available for the departure runway, visibility must be reported to be 1/2
mile (800 meters). When weather is below approach and landing minimums (ceiling or visibility)
a takeoff alternate is required (See paragraph 6.18)
6.17. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3.
Select alternates that are not restricted by FLIP, FCG, or diplomatic clearances, and are
compatible with the mission load and performance characteristics of the aircraft. The PIC retains
final authority in the choice of alternates; however, selection by support agencies normally
should be used if they meet the above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                      33


6.18. Departure Alternates.
   6.18.1. A departure alternate is required if weather (ceiling or visibility) is below landing
   minimums for the available approach (at departure aerodrome).
   6.18.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the
   aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude
   (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria. To qualify as
   a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:
       6.18.2.1. For an alternate within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be
       equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1
       hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400), or;
       6.18.2.2. For an alternate within 1 hour flying time, the existing weather must be at least
       500-1 above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than 600-
       2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain
       so for 1 hour after estimated time of arrival (ETA) at the alternate. NOTE: OG/CC may
       approve the use of an alternate up to 2 hours away. Comply with weather/approach
       requirements of para 6.18.2.2
6.19. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will
be according to AFI 11-202V3 and the following:
   6.19.1. File two alternates when:
       6.19.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for the
       available DoD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach; or
       6.19.1.2. The forecast ceiling OR visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than
       published for all non precision DoD/National Geospacial Agency (NGA)/NACO
       approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement (for example Jeppesen
       approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published
       HAA or HAT and rounding it up to the nearest one hundred feet (or as determined by
       MAJCOM terminal instrument procedures (TERPS) review). For example, a Jeppesen
       VOR approach with a published HAA of 642 feet would require a forecasted ceiling of
       700 feet; or
       6.19.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected
       for RCR.
   6.19.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the destination aerodrome is
   outside the CONUS.
   6.19.3. When filing to a remote or island destination, aircrews may use 1+15 holding fuel (in
   lieu of an alternate). Compute holding fuel using planned destination gross weight at flight
   level (FL) 200. A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which due to its
   unique geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours
   flying time. The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following
   criteria:
       6.19.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA
       and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and
 34                                                            AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008


      6.19.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
      minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a
      precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-
      precision approach minimums (excluding airport surveillance radar (ASR)), but not
      below precision approach minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours). NOTE: Most weather
      forecasts are only valid plus or minus 1 hour from estimated time of arrival.
6.20. Adverse Weather.
   6.20.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
      6.20.1.1. Crews should confirm the type of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies to, or
      what type of aircraft reported the encounter, to gain a more accurate picture for their
      route of flight.
      6.20.1.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts
      fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated.
      WARNING: Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened
      and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
   6.20.2. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged
   operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.
   NOTE: Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological
   Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and freezing rain is
   equivalent to severe icing. When freezing fog is forecast or reported, aircrews should confirm
   with the local weather agency what type (if any) icing is associated with the freezing fog.
      6.20.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain. Do not takeoff under
      conditions of freezing drizzle except when aircraft has been properly de-iced/anti-iced
      IAW flight manual procedures.
      6.20.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures below 0°C, may
      cause ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surface. When an aircraft requires de-
      icing/anti-icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
          6.20.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluid types (i.e. I, II, IV) listed
          in their respective flight manual. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all
          restrictions in their associated flight manual with respect to anti-ice/de-ice
          procedures.
          6.20.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids do not provide any anti-
          icing benefit, and therefore do not have holdover times. As a guide, for approved anti-
          icing fluids, crews may use published anti-icing holdover times IAW T.O. 42C-1-2,
          Aircraft Anti-icing Procedures, and Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA)
          holdover tables located at the HQ AFFSA website. The holdover time begins when
          anti-icing fluid is first applied and the PIC shall use time, temperature, and dilution of
          mixture to determine when times are exceeded and re-apply fluid if required.
          6.20.2.2.3. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is
          completed within 5 minutes of departure.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                   35


  6.20.3. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.
  If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2000 feet,
  avoid them by at least:
     6.20.3.1. 20 NMs at or above FL230.
     6.20.3.2. 10 NMs below FL230.
     6.20.3.3. 5 NMs for tactical low-level operations below FL230 provided the outside air
     temperature is at or above 0°C at flight altitude. Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a
     rapidly moving thunderstorm. CAUTION: Aircraft damage may occur 20NMs or more
     from any thunderstorm. Aircrews must familiarize themselves with information on
     thunderstorm development and hazards. Refer to AFH 11-203, Volumes 1 and 2,
     Weather for Aircrews.
  6.20.4. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be
  used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather. When
  relying exclusively on ground-based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller
  is unable to provide avoidance instructions, attempt to maintain VMC.
  6.20.5. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and
  advected clouds (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
  thunderstorms.
  6.20.6. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
  departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
     6.20.6.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
     6.20.6.2. Maintain at least 5 NMs separation from heavy rain showers
     6.20.6.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e. clouds within plus or minus 5,000
     feet of the freezing level or plus or minus 8°C of the freezing level. NOTE: Approaches
     or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10NMs providing
     they are not producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds,
     gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and are not forecast or
     observed to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include the planned
     missed approach corridor, if applicable).
  6.20.7. When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C
  or below, refer to the FIH Section D, Temperature Correction Chart, and AFI 11-202V3
  Temperature Correction paragraph, to ensure adequate obstacle clearance.
  6.20.8. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave
  turbulence.
     6.20.8.1. Mountain wave turbulence is normally a predictable condition. Military
     weather forecasters can advise crews of the potential for encountering mountain wave
     turbulence. However, weather data availability in mountainous regions and forecast
     model limitations prevent the prediction of all events. Crews must be familiar with the
     causes of mountain wave turbulence and the characteristic clouds that generally forewarn
     its presence.
 36                                                            AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008


   6.20.9. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of forecast or known
   volcanic activity or dust is prohibited. Plan all missions to avoid volcanic activity by at least
   20 NMs.
   6.20.10. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most conducive to lightning
   strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
       6.20.10.1. Within 8°C of freezing.
       6.20.10.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with
       thunderstorm activity.
6.21. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a logic based, common sense approach
to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during,
and after all operations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in AFI 90-901, Operational Risk
Management. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and local guidance as part
of preflight activities.

Section 6C—Preflight

6.22. Air Force Technical Order Forms 781 Series. Review AFTO Forms 781 series before
applying power to the aircraft or operating aircraft systems. An exceptional release must be
signed before flight. A maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian
normally signs the exceptional release. If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may
sign the exceptional release. Ensure that the DD Form 1896, DoD Fuel Identaplate, and Multi-
Service Corporation (MSC) card are aboard the aircraft.
6.23. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition that
might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to another
station. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation,
Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. After the maintenance
release is obtained, coordinate mission requirements with the controlling agency. The PICs
concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown.
6.24. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base (MOB). The PIC is responsible
for ensuring the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission taskings. If qualified maintenance
specialists are unavailable, the aircrew is responsible for turning the aircraft to meet subsequent
mission taskings.
   6.24.1. In those instances where maintenance personnel are not available and crew members
   are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections, the PIC will enter a red dash
   symbol in the AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
   Document, updating current status and enter a red dash symbol and a discrepancy that
   reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection (i.e. preflight, thru-flight, basic post-
   flight) is overdue.
6.25. Life Support Requirements.
   6.25.1. Oxygen. Oxygen on board for takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned
   flight from the equal time point (ETP) to recovery should oxygen be required.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                      37


       6.25.1.1. All C-12 aircraft should have two [pilots] emergency escape breathing devices
       (EEBD) on the aircraft.
       6.25.1.2. On flights carrying passengers, one Emergency Passenger Oxygen System
       (EPOS) should be available for each passenger. EPOSs will be distributed near each
       passenger seat and their use demonstrated before departure. NOTE: The EPOS is not a
       substitute for the required aircraft’s emergency passenger supplemental oxygen system
       used in the event of cabin depressurization (above 10,000 feet) but rather as a temporary
       measure to provide oxygen to passengers in a toxic environment (smoke/fumes).
       6.25.1.3. Crewmembers occupying a crew station will have an oxygen mask connected
       and readily available for use from engine start until engine shutdown.
   6.25.2. Rafts. On overwater flights, carry a life raft when the distance from land at the
   planned cruising altitude exceeds a glide ratio of approximately 2 miles per 1000 feet (12:1
   glide ratio). For example, if planned cruising altitude is FL240, a life raft would be required
   if flying more than 48 miles from land.
   6.25.3. Life preserver units (LPUs) or Personal Floatation Device (PFD). An aircrew
   member will ensure an LPU is within easy reach of each passenger and aircrew member
   before takeoff on overwater flights (outside gliding distance to land). Ensure the appropriate
   number and type of life preservers are aboard for overwater missions carrying children and
   infants.
6.26. Passenger Handling and Cargo Documentation. Reference Chapter 13.
6.27. Airlifting Hazardous Cargo. For additional information regarding hazardous materials,
refer to AFMAN 24-204.
   6.27.1. Flight Planning. The PIC will:
       6.27.1.1. Enter "Hazardous Cargo" and the mission identifier or flight number in the
       appropriate section of the flight plan. Use Remarks section of DD175, Military Flight
       Plan, and Other Information section of DD1801, International Flight Plan. Refer to the
       FCG for country specific requirements concerning over-flight when transporting
       hazardous materials cargo.
       6.27.1.2. If possible, plan the flight to minimize overflying heavily populated or
       otherwise critical areas. Approach, landing, and takeoff tracks are excluded.
       6.27.1.3. Prepare a departure message at stations when a C2 center is not available. The
       remarks section of the departure message will include: Class of hazardous material, DoD
       class or division for explosives, net explosive weight (NEW), and gross weight. If
       required, request special handling (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical escort teams,
       etc.).
       6.27.1.4. If estimated time en route (ETE) is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances
       preclude timely message receipt at destination, notify the next destination of the ETA and
       information listed in paragraph 6.29.2.3. If available, C2 will relay required information
       to next destination.

Section 6D—Departure

6.30. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are on time if the aircraft is airborne within -
20/+14 minutes of scheduled takeoff time or as specified in a MAJCOM supplement.

Section 6E—En route

6.31. Flight Progress. In-flight, use all available navigational aids to monitor the flight
management system (FMS) performance. Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of
navigation capability that degrades navigation accuracy to the controlling air route traffic control
center (ARTCC).
6.32. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM is
applied is considered special qualification airspace. Both the operator and the aircraft must be
certified for operations in this airspace. The C-12 is not currently certified for RVSM airspace.
6.33. Communications Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings (CIRVIS)
and Other Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as indicated in FLIP
planning or FLIP En route Supplement.
   6.33.1. In-flight harassment or hostile action against aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
   harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF
 40                                                            AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008


   air and ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type,
   insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed,
   and the type of harassment. Request relay of the report to the nearest C2 agency.
   6.33.2. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in AFMAN 10-206, Operational
   Reporting.
6.34. In-Flight Meals. Pilots should not eat meals at the same time and their meals should
consist of different menu items.
6.35. High Frequency (HF) Communications. Crews should conduct an HF radio ground
check if use of the HF radio may be required for ATC or C2 communications. If unable to
establish HF contact with the controlling HF station, and an alternate means of relay of ATC
information is not available, the aircraft should follow theater guidance (refer to FLIP AP 1/2/3)
or return to the nearest suitable support base for repairs.
6.36. In-flight Emergency Procedures. The PIC shall report deviations from directives that
may occur as a result of an emergency according to AFI 11-202V3. Time and conditions
permitting, inform passengers of the situation and intentions.
6.37. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care,
inform the station of intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by medical
personnel. Include the sex, approximate age, and the major complaint in the request.
6.38. Weather Forecasts. The pilot is responsible for obtaining destination weather prior to
arrival in the terminal area.
   6.38.1. The primary means of obtaining weather forecasts is for the home station weather
   flight to provide or arrange for forecast support. If this is not practical while in a transient
   status, contact the supporting Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) for the region the flight
   will originate. OWS areas of responsibility can be found in the FIH/FLIP.
   6.38.2. The ATC system can provide weather information to en route aircraft. In addition,
   weather information may be obtained through Automatic Terminal Information Service
   (ATIS) and or the Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS).
       6.38.2.1. The ARTCCs have a limited capability to provide weather information to en
       route aircraft within CONUS. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET) and
       other National Weather Service in-flight weather advisories are issued for large areas.
       Contact appropriate military weather facility or flight service station to determine mission
       applicability and impact.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.39. Descent. Before descent into unfamiliar areas, pilots will review appropriate terrain charts
to increase aircrew situational awareness of obstructions. Primary crewmembers will not be
involved in duties other than aircraft operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required
checklist items from the initial descent point to landing.
   6.39.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
   night or during marginal weather.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                    41


      6.39.1.1. A visual approach may be flown during night VFR conditions if an approved
      straight-in instrument approach to the landing runway is not available or a tactical
      approach is desired.
6.40. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   6.40.1. Aircraft category. The C-12 is certified by the FAA as a Category "B" aircraft having
   a speed range of 91 knots or more but less than 121 knots throughout the final approach
   segment and missed approach. Use the category minimums commensurate with the
   configuration appropriate speed for the approach flown. Follow the technical order guidance
   when flying the approach and if is necessary to maneuver at speeds in excess of the upper
   limit of a speed range for a category then the minimums for the next higher category should
   be used.
   6.40.2. Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply
   with the missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202V3. Use the
   Approach Climb Gradient chart in the flight manual.
   6.40.3. Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach pilots will confirm the
   existing weather is reported to be at or above required approach minimums.
      6.40.3.1. For circling approaches without published minima, the required ceiling shall be
      computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 feet rounded up to the next one hundred
      foot value. For example, if the HAA is 747 feet, add 100 feet to get 847 feet and then
      round up to the next one hundred foot value which would be 900 feet. Circling minimums
      will be no lower than 600 feet ceiling and 2 miles visibility.
      6.40.3.2. Increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by ½
      statue mile (SM) or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the
      runway approach lighting system (ALS) is inoperative. This applies only to the ALS
      itself, not to visual approach slope indicator (VASI), precision approach path indicator
      (PAPI), and other lights that are not a component of the ALS.
      6.40.3.3. If the ceiling is below the value depicted for published precision approach, but
      visibility is at or above authorized minimums, the PIC will comply with fuel
      requirements of Chapter 14, before initiating en route descent, penetration, or approach.
   6.40.4. Flight Instrumentation Requirements.
      6.40.4.1. Full flight instrumentation for a Category I ILS, for the pilot flying the
      approach, consists of an attitude indicator (ADI), a course deviation indicator (CDI), a
      means to identify the navigational aid (NAVAID) (either aurally or by verifying the
      correct station identifier on the distance measuring equipment (DME) indicator),
      complete differential pressure instruments, and heading/ compass systems.
      6.40.4.2. Full flight instrumentation for a precision approach radar (PAR), for the pilot
      flying the approach, consists of complete differential pressure instruments,
      heading/compass systems, and an attitude indicator.
   6.40.5. Category I ILS Procedures. DH for precision approaches will be as published, but no
   lower than 200 feet HAT.
 42                                                      AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008


   6.40.6. Nondirectional beacon (NDB) Procedures. NDB approaches may be flown during
   day, night, or IMC conditions.
   6.40.7. Random Navigation (RNAV) Procedures. Trained and certified C-12 pilots are
   authorized to fly RNAV and RNAV (GPS) approaches.
   6.40.8. See Table 6.1 for complete listing of C-12 Communication, Navigation System
   (CNS)/Air Traffic Management (ATM) approved operations for electronic flight instrument

   6.40.9. Established on a Segment of the Approach. When established on a segment of the
   approach and the weather is reported or observed to be below approach minimums, the PIC
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                      43


   has the option of continuing the approach to the MAPor DH (as applicable). Do not break off
   an approach until cleared by ATC.
      6.40.9.1. If the approach is continued, the PIC must have sufficient fuel available to
      complete the approach, missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with normal
      fuel reserve.
   6.40.10. Holding. An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but
   forecast to improve to or above minimums provided:
      6.40.10.1. The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate
      and hold for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to
      remain at or above alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time.
      6.40.10.2. Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel
      will be consumed.
6.41. Classified Equipment and Material. Comply with the following or as directed in
MAJCOM supplement.
   6.41.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure the C2 center or base
   operations office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security IAW Chapter 7 of this
   AFI. At bases not under jurisdiction of the AF, ensure the aircraft and equipment are
   protected. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, provides specific
   guidance concerning the security of various levels of classified equipment aboard aircraft.
   For classified aircraft components which cannot be removed and stored, lock the aircraft. If
   available, use Ravens to guard the aircraft; otherwise, use guards employed by the host
   country for flightline/airport area control. Do not leave unguarded classified information
   stored in navigation or radio equipment.
   6.41.2. Material. Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination
   and receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material. The on-site C2 center will
   provide temporary storage for COMSEC and other classified materials during en route,
   turnaround, and crew rest stops. If a storage facility is not available, the aircraft gun storage
   box may be used for material classified up to and including SECRET. Encrypted COMSEC
   will only be transferred to authorized DoD personnel. IAW Air Force Systems Security
   Instruction (AFSSI) 3021, Operational Security Instruction for the AN/CYZ-10/10A Data
   Transfer Device (DTD), after picking up material from a security facility, the crypto-ignition
   key (CIK) should be removed from the CYZ-10 and only inserted into the CYZ-10 when
   using this device.
      6.41.2.1. Remain overnight (RON) COMSEC Storage. Refer to AFI 33-201,
      Communications Security (COMSEC), for additional guidance. Every effort should be
      made to store classified material in a secure facility (i.e. Base Operations/Command Post)
      if that facility exists. If remaining overnight at a location that does not or cannot provide
      this storage capability, then the following procedures should be used:
          6.41.2.1.1. If carrying an electronic keyed device, (i.e. CYZ-10), the key will be
          removed from the device and carried by one of the pilots. Place the device
          somewhere on the aircraft not in plain view (i.e. under a seat, in a closet, in the
          baggage compartment).
 44                                                           AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008


           6.41.2.1.2. If using a KOI-18 or KYK-13, the entire device may be placed in its
           sealable/ tamper resistant pouch and placed in a securable storage box. The pouch
           will be locked and the key will be kept by an aircrew member.
           6.41.2.1.3. All classified documents (authenticators, SPINS extracts, etc) will be
           locked in a securable storage box. The key to the box will also be carried at all times
           by one of the pilots. The aircraft will then be locked, including the emergency exit.
           Upon return to the aircraft, the crew must inspect the aircraft and documents for
           tampering and report any suspected or possible compromise immediately, even if it
           delays the mission.
   6.41.3. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode 4 when required for mission
   accomplishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode 4 (ground
   test assets permitting) before deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD or
   contingency/exercise tasking.
   6.41.4. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode 4 before takeoff. Do not delay takeoff nor cancel
   a mission for an inoperable Mode 4, except when the aircraft will transit an area where safe
   passage procedures are implemented.
   6.41.5. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode 4 on all missions departing the CONUS for
   overseas locations. Aircrews can request the Mode 4 interrogation check through North
   American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) on UHF frequency 364.2.
   6.41.6. Aircraft with inoperable Mode 4 will continue to their intended destinations. Repairs
   will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and maintenance
   technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented, aircraft will follow
   procedures for inoperable Mode 4 as directed in the applicable Airspace Control Order
   (ACO).
   6.41.7. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode 4, when conducted, are mandatory
   maintenance debrief items. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation of
   the Mode 4 on all aircraft forms (AFTO Form 781A).
   6.41.8. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate the
   Mode 4 on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Before departing for any
   destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local COMSEC
   managers for guidance.
6.42. Maintenance. Complete AFTO Form 781 after each flight. After landing, crewmembers
will debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft. At stations where there is no
maintenance, and maintenance support is required, crews should contact their home unit or
maintenance contractor for guidance. Notify controlling C2 and home station of maintenance
status before entering crew rest.
6.43. Border Clearance.
   6.43.1. Normal Operations. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the
   border clearance of its aircraft.
       6.43.1.1. When support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC.
       Duties may be assigned to ground personnel, but the PIC retains ultimate responsibility.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                   45


     When a C-12 aircraft is onloaded at a base without a passenger processing function, the
     PIC is responsible for ensuring the following:
         6.43.1.1.1. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers possess current passports and valid
         visas, when required.
         6.43.1.1.2. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers have current certificates of
         immunization (shotrecord).
         6.43.1.1.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
         6.43.1.1.4. Departing or entering the US through a location where border clearance
         can be obtained.
         6.43.1.1.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and
         baggage, if required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign
         area.
         6.43.1.1.6. Spraying the aircraft (see the FCG and Paragraph 6.47).
  6.43.2. Procedures for US Entry.
     6.43.2.1. En route, distribute personal customs declarations (when not accomplished by
     passenger services) to all passengers, troops, and crewmembers. A pilot will also brief
     passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations, and prepare and compile necessary
     border clearance forms for the PIC’s signature.
     6.43.2.2. En route, notify the C2 agency at the base of intended landing of any change in
     ETA to ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
     6.43.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require an aircraft, which
     has landed in the US for customs clearance, to proceed to another base in the US to
     obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of cargo,
     passengers, and crew until arrival at the offload station, and saves intermediate offloading
     and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to proceed is valid
     only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance must be completed or a
     new permit to proceed issued by a customs official. Do not make intermediate stops
     between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination of manifested cargo
     unless required by an emergency or directed by the controlling C2 center.
     6.43.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
     normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane
     passengers, troops, or crewmembers unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life
     and property. Do not unload until approved by customs and agriculture personnel or their
     designated representatives. This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US and all
     landings required when operating on a permit to proceed or until all crew, passengers,
     and cargo complete final border clearance.
  6.43.3. Inspections of U.S. Aircraft by Foreign Officials.
     6.43.3.1. Follow USAF policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the FCG. In
     substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft are immune from searches, seizures,
     and inspections (including customs and safety inspections) by foreign officials. In
46                                                             AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008


     addition, PICs must be aware of, and adhere to, any specific FCG provisions for
     individual countries.
     6.43.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use
     the following procedures.
         6.43.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the
         PIC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to
         search without consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials
         in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as
         not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have
         authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.43.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make
         every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters
         (through MAJCOM C2) or the appropriate embassy officials. The PIC should then
         notify these agencies of foreign request by the most expeditious means available and
         follow their instructions.
         6.43.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending
         notification to USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should
         indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying
         time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do
         so.
         6.43.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
         way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action
         being pursued and that he intends to notify both USAF headquarters and the
         appropriate American embassy of the foreign action. The PIC should not attempt
         physical resistance, and should thereafter report the incident to USAF headquarters
         and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The PIC should escort foreign
         authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
  6.43.4. Exercises and Contingency Operations.
     6.43.4.1. General. Certain airlift missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or
     exit, require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
     immunization, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding,
     between these agencies and MAJCOM establishes certain procedures and waivers.
     6.43.4.2. Implementation. Implementation of the agreement is not automatic. Traffic and
     border clearing agencies implement all or part of the agreement as necessary for each
     operation. Inspection and clearance may be accomplished at the US onload or offload
     base, or at the foreign onload or offload base.
     6.43.4.3. Customs Procedures.
         6.43.4.3.1. Outbound: No requirement. Filing of Customs Form 7507 [found at
         http://www.customs.gov] is not required unless directed.

               each passenger not under command of the troop commander, to include
               observers, support personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers.
               6.43.4.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
               representative will meet the aircraft and accept the troop commander's
               certificate with respect to troop baggage. Individual baggage declarations are
               not required. The troop commander should have inspected troop baggage.
               6.43.4.3.2.3.4. Troops will debark under the observation of the customs
               representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The customs
               officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.
            6.43.4.3.2.4. For troops who are out of the country 140 days or more:
               6.43.4.3.2.4.1. One copy of the U.S. Customs Baggage Declaration Form for
               each passenger. This includes observers, support personnel, civilians, news
               media personnel, and crewmembers.
               6.43.4.3.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
               representative will meet the aircraft and collect all declarations. Troops will
               debark under the observation of the customs representative who may make
               discretionary examination of the baggage.
     6.43.4.4. Public Health Procedures.
        6.43.4.4.1. When operating from a base without a public health officer, the PIC will
        ensure all crewmembers and passengers are properly immunized.
        6.43.4.4.2. Spray the aircraft if required.
     6.43.4.5. Immigration Procedures.
        6.43.4.5.1. Outbound: No requirements.
        6.43.4.5.2. Inbound: Submit the following to the immigration inspector if carrying
        civilian passengers.
            6.43.4.5.2.1. One copy of Customs Form 7507.
     6.43.4.6. Agriculture Procedures:
        6.43.4.6.1. Outbound: No requirement.
        6.43.4.6.2. Inbound: Consult AMC Border Clearance Guide.
            6.43.4.6.2.1. The command being airlifted will instruct troops that no fresh fruit,
            milk, milk products, vegetables, plants, plant pests, soil samples, animals, meat,
            and animal products can be brought into the US. All items of troop personal
            gear/cargo are to be cleaned of mud, dirt, sand, and other foreign material before
 48                                                            AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008


              being brought aboard the aircraft. Personal gear and equipment must be examined
              for snails and other plant pests to prevent their accidental entry into the U.S.
              6.43.4.6.2.2. Before loading, the command responsible for cargo being airlifted
              will clear cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil.
              6.43.4.6.2.3. When required by agricultural quarantine regulations, the FCG, or
              higher headquarters, the aircraft will receive an aerosol treatment 30 minutes
              before landing.
              6.43.4.6.2.4. On arrival, agricultural inspectors will inspect the aircraft after
              troops have disembarked. Crewmembers will assemble remains of in-flight
              lunches for prompt removal by fleet service personnel.
              6.43.4.6.2.5. Inspectors examine baggage, equipment, and cargo as offloaded.
              Any items found to be contaminated will be held for such treatment as the
              inspector may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical cleaning, or fumigation).
   6.43.5. Military Customs Pre-clearance Inspection Program. All crewmembers will ensure
   compliance with Military Customs Pre-clearance requirements.
6.44. Insect and Pest Control.
   6.44.1. Responsibility. PICs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to
   AFJI 48-104, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces, DoD FCG, or as directed by
   higher headquarters. Certify the spraying on Customs Form 7507, or on forms provided by
   the country transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on board. The only
   exception is when mandated by the FCG.
       6.44.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent,
       National Stock Number (NSN) 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft.
       Wear leather or Nomex® gloves while spraying.
          6.44.1.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being
          sprayed.
          6.44.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely
          loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments,
          wheel wells, and other similar spaces.
          6.44.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the
          aircraft after the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and
          ventilation openings. CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after
          use, spray before boarding crew or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10
          minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on
          board.
       6.44.1.2. Spray for 105 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being
       transited. Keep used aerosol cans separate from other trash so they may be disposed of
       safely.
   6.44.2. Responsibility of PIC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the
   aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, airfield management operations, or airport
   manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                    49


   6.44.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not
   open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for
   insect or rodent infestation. Do not onload or offload cargo or passengers until the inspection
   is satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local
   requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.

Section 6G—Miscellaneous

6.45. Dropped Object Prevention. If an externally dropped object is discovered, the flight
crew will notify ATC and C2 as soon as practical.
6.46. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing and
terminating the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker.
6.47. Passenger Restrictions. No-show passenger baggage or baggage of passengers removed
from flight will be downloaded prior to departure.
6.48. Life Support and Dash 21 Equipment. Prior to departure, ensure appropriate life
support, survival, and Dash 21 equipment are aboard the aircraft.
   6.48.1. Prior to departure, review, sign, and date the AFTO Form 46, Pre-positioned Life
   Support Equipment.
   6.48.2. Prior to departure, ensure survival gear configuration matches mission requirements.
   For over-water missions, confirm appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard.
   6.48.3. Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will:
       6.48.3.1. Make an AFTO Form 781 entry for missing equipment.
       6.48.3.2. Annotate AFTO Form 46 in the next vacant column indicating the quantity
       remaining for the item.
   6.48.4. Aircraft commanders will determine whether or not to replace the missing equipment
   before continuing the mission.
6.49. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the
PIC should impound the aircraft immediately after landing and contact the controlling C2 agency
for further instructions.
6.50. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria.
Acceptance of traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach
clearance is acknowledgment that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts
responsibility of providing wake turbulence separation. Refer to FLIP GP for additional
information.

                                            Chapter 7

                                    AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
aircraft piracy (hijacking). AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, FAA
Notice (FAAN) 7110.422, Aircraft Hijack and Suspicious Inflight Activities Response and
Notification Procedures, and specific MAJCOM security publications contain additional
guidance. Aircrews will not release information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed
aircrew members or missions to the public.
7.2. Security. Aircraft security at non-United States military installations is the responsibility of
the controlling agency and/or PIC.
7.3. Air Force Installation Security Program. The following security procedures will
implement AFI31-101 requirements for C-12 aircraft:
   7.3.1. Protecting Distinguished Visitor (DV) Aircraft. When the DV is a Code 4 (3-star
   general or civilian equivalent) or above, follow these procedures:
       7.3.1.1. Parking Locations. Park DV aircraft in a prominent area so maintenance
       personnel and security forces patrols can closely monitor them.
       7.3.1.2. Notification Procedures. Establish procedures to inform security forces of the
       arrival, parking arrangements, and departure of all DV aircraft.
   7.3.2. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local
   security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If he or she
   determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate
   security is available.
   7.3.3. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force
   POC must be identified to the PIC.
7.4. Locking and Sealing. Lock the aircraft during a RON on non-secure ramps.
7.5. En Route Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to
ensure adequate en route security is available. PIC will receive a threat assessment and en route
security capability evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation prior to home station
departure and should request updates from en route C2 as required.
   7.5.1. Arrival. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following
   actions as required:
       7.5.1.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local
       authorities request payment for this service, use SF 44.
       7.5.1.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crew members to
       remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in
       the aircraft vicinity.
       7.5.1.3. Inadequate Security. If, in the opinion of the PIC, airfield security is inadequate
       and the PIC determines the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the
       FDP limits and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                      51


      considered reliable. Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as
      practical. If a departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of
      their ability. In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest
      requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.
      The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft
      protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the
      nearest DoD installation, US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as
      appropriate.
   7.5.2. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their
   duties under escort and should not be placed on the Entry Access List (EAL).
   7.5.3. Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.
7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
   7.6.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed
   to allow ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC judgment, the aircraft needs to be
   locked in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
      7.6.1.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices.
      7.6.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape
      inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
      7.6.1.3. Close and lock the door.
      7.6.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of
      a forced entry.
      7.6.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Air Force Office of Special
      Investigation (AFOSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency. Have
      aircraft thoroughly inspected prior to flight.
   7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   In addition to normal preflight activities, aircrews must inspect areas of the aircraft not
   covered by normal preflight duties, to include inside inboard main landing gear doors, nose
   wheel compartment, and the aft avionics bay for unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious
   items to host security forces. Aircrews will maintain a heightened security posture
   throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.7. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
   7.7.1. The Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), pursuant to Title 49,
   United States Code, section 44903(e), has exclusive responsibility to direct law enforcement
   activity in responding to an actual or suspected air piracy (hijacking) situation involving all
   aircraft (civil and military) in-flight in the United States.
   7.7.2. Military forces taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.7.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
 52                                                             AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008


   weapons of mass destruction, DoD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will
   consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.7.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
   7.7.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.7.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
7.8. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When operating away from home
station, the PIC will comply with this chapter and FAA Notice (FAAN) 7110.422.
   7.8.1. Preventive measures include thorough passenger anti-hijacking inspections. Do not
   board passengers until the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of
   qualified passenger service representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection
   of passengers and baggage is accomplished.
   7.8.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.
   When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform
   required inspections prior to loading.
   7.8.3. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
   baggage aboard an aircraft. EXCEPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
   State Department, Raven Team Members, and other individuals specifically authorized to
   carry weapons.
   7.8.4. Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
   aircraft. They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded
   weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations. When the tactical
   situation dictates (in coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at the order of
   the troop commander or team leader.
   7.8.5. If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to move to a safe, clear area at
   least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging
   weapons.
7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an AF installation or aircraft within
the US, response will be according to FAA Order (FAAO) 7110.422. Resist all attempts to hijack
a military aircraft.
7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude using any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life, or damage to the aircraft in
flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material on board.
7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will notify ground agencies in accordance with FIH.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                    53


7.12. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. Refer to FIH for international signals for
air intercept.
7.13. Arming of Crew Members. When crews are directed to carry weapons, one pilot will
normally be armed. All crew members should know who is armed. The following procedures
apply when arming is directed:
   7.13.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapons, ammunition, box,
   lock and key. Crew members will be armed according to C2 directives and MAJCOM
   publications.
   7.13.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapon in a holster. Conceal weapon when directed to
   prevent identifying armed crew members. Do not wear weapon off the flight line except to
   and from the C2, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities. In general,
   at overseas locations, weapons are not to be brought off the aircraft. In countries where
   FCG/Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) authorizes such action, every effort should be
   made to keep all firearms onboard the aircraft unless appropriately responding to a hostile
   event or being moved to/from storage at an armory. Raven weapons are not to be brought off
   the aircraft unless responding to hostile action or being moved to/ from storage at an armory.
       7.13.2.1. Air Mobility Command (AMC) Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed
       crewmembers must discreetly identify themselves to AMC passenger service personnel
       upon arrival at security checkpoints. One crewmember will present a valid set of crew
       orders, military identification card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear
       Firearms, authorizing the carrying of concealed weapons. Once terminal personnel verify
       this, they will allow the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crewmembers. The
       entire crew will then proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects from
       their pockets. This will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are
       armed.
7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.
Reference AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual and AFI 10-245, Air Force Antiterrorism
Standards, for Force Protection measures.

AFI 91-202 for more information concerning the HATR program.
   8.3.1. AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety
   Investigations and Reports, list HATR reportable incidents.
   8.3.2. The PIC shall report the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g. center,
   Flight Service Station (FSS), control tower, or aeronautical radio station) as quickly as safety
   allows. Include the following information in the radio call (as appropriate):
       8.3.2.1. Aircraft identification or call sign.
       8.3.2.2. Time and place (radial/DME of NAVAID, position relative to the airfield,
       incident, etc).
       8.3.2.3. Altitude or flight level.
       8.3.2.4. Description of the other aircraft or vehicle.
       8.3.2.5. Advise controlling ATC agency that the PIC will file a HATR upon landing.
   8.3.3. Deadline to file a HATR is 24 hours after event via any communication mode
   available. If landing airport has a USAF airfield management function, submit completed AF
   Form 651 to the airfield management officer for forwarding to wing safety office. If landing
   airport does not have an airfield management office, notify the safety office of the Air Force
   base nearest to location where the condition occurred, PIC’s home base safety office, or as
   prescribed by overseas MAJCOM. In that case, provide contact sufficient information to
   prepare AF Form 651.
   8.3.4. Aircrews are reminded that IAW AFI 91-202 A3.4., properly reported HATRs grant
   the aircrew immunity from disciplinary action provided:
       8.3.4.1. If they were the offending party, their violation was not deliberate.
       8.3.4.2. They committed no criminal offense.
       8.3.4.3. Their actions did not result in a mishap.
       8.3.4.4. They properly reported the incident using procedures above.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                      55


8.4. Report Violations, Unusual Events, or Circumstances. PICs shall document events that
require them to deviate from AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, (unless waived by
appropriate authority) or alleged navigation errors (include over-water position errors over
24NMs, border, or ATC violations).
   8.4.1. Describe deviation(s) using the following report format:
       8.4.1.1. Facts. Report pertinent details of the event.
       8.4.1.2. Investigation and analysis. Report circumstances which required/drove
       deviation(s).
       8.4.1.3. Findings and conclusions.
       8.4.1.4. Recommendations to prevent recurrence.
       8.4.1.5. Corrective actions taken.
   8.4.2. Include the following attachments with the report:
       8.4.2.1. Formal notification of incident.
       8.4.2.2. Crewmembers’ official statements (if applicable).
       8.4.2.3. Other pertinent documents submitted in evidence (logs, charts, etc.).
   8.4.3. OG/CC shall send the original investigation report to the appropriate MAJCOM
   within 45 days of the event/notification.
   8.4.4. Use OPREP-3 reporting procedures contained in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting,
   for navigation errors over 24 NMs.
   8.4.5. PICs shall expeditiously report unusual events/circumstances that impact their mission
   to appropriate MAJCOM agencies. Reportable events include, but are not limited to,
   spectrum interference, interception, engine failure, hostile fire, injury to passenger or aircrew
   member, etc. This list is not all exhaustive. Most events require C2 agents to forward OPREP
   reports to higher headquarters. In all cases, pass the ―who, what, when, where, why, and
   how‖ of the incident to a C2 agency.
       8.4.5.1. The Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, covered in AFI 10-707,
       Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, establishes procedures to combat the effect
       of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference. PICs who encounter electromagnetic
       interference (EMI) will report the event to the nearest C2 agency as soon as practical.
8.5. Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) Aviation Fuels Documentation. This section
prescribes aviation POL (AVPOL) procedures that ensure correct documentation, form and
invoice processing, and program supervision. Use the Multi Service Corporation (MSC) Air
Card for the purchase of aviation fuel and ancillary ground services at commercial airports (and
some military installations) worldwide. The Air Card is authorized for use by all U.S.
government aircraft, state, and local law enforcement aircraft, and some foreign government
aircraft. All PICs should plan to use the ―platinum‖ MSC card. In most cases, there will be no
changes when refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations. The
MSC card is accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. A list of all MSC-accepting
merchants can be found at https://www.airseacard.com. It replaces the SF 44 at locations that
accept the MSC card.

  8.5.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL
  procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of the MSC card
  could create financial liability for the purchaser.
  8.5.2. Refuel/defuel USAF aircraft at DoD locations whenever possible. If DoD service is
  not available, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority:
        8.5.2.1. Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) or Canadian into-plane contracts.
        8.5.2.2. Foreign government air forces. NOTE: DoD FLIP en route supplements identify
        locations with into-plane contracts.
     8.5.3. AVPOL Forms Documentation and Procedures.
        8.5.3.1. The DD 1898, Fuel Sale Slip, is the fuel transaction receipt used for purchases at
        other DoD locations, including DFSC into-plane contract locations. NOTE: If the
        contractor insists on a unique invoice along with the DD1898, annotate the vendor’s
        invoice with ―DUPLICATE DD1898 ACCOMPLISHED‖.
        8.5.3.2. The SF 44 may be used to purchase fuel, ground services and/or other authorized
        products when no MSC card contract is in place.
           8.5.3.2.1. The aircrew shall present the SF 44 as the purchase invoice when a fixed
           base operator (FBO) refuses to accept the MSC card. The aircrew shall complete the
           SF 44 and attach it to the FBO vendor ticket/invoice when the FBO also declines use
           of the SF 44 and uses its own invoice/receipt. Fuel purchases shall be documented on
           a separate SF 44 from ground services and other authorized products since the FBO
           must invoice DESC for the fuel and the customer for non-fuel product and services.
               8.5.3.2.1.1. Copies 1 and 2 of the SF 44 shall be provided to the FBO. Copy 1 of
               the SF 44 and one copy of the FBO commercial invoice, if applicable, shall be
               forwarded to the following address by the FBO to bill/invoice DESC: DESC-
               RRF, Building 1621-K, 2261 Hughes Avenue, Suite 128, Lackland AFB, Texas
               78236.
               8.5.3.2.1.2. Copy 3 of the SF 44 and one copy of the FBO commercial invoice, if
               applicable, shall be provided to the aircrew. Aircrews shall present all fuel
               purchase receipts to the designated aviation squadron Certifying Official and/or
               Accountable Official upon return to home station to enable timely validation and
               financial obligation processing into the Fuels Automated System (FAS).
        8.5.3.3. Fuel purchases where the FBO requires cash payment. Cash fuel purchases are
        only authorized when either the DoD 4500.54G, DoD Foreign Clearance Guide, requires
        cash payment or when FBO locations outside the US and US Territories refuse MSC card
        and/or SF 44 invoicing processes. Aircrews required to pay cash for aviation fuel
        purchases shall employ the following procedures: NOTE: These procedures do not apply
        to non-fuel products or services.
           8.5.3.3.1. The aircrew shall obtain cash from a local DoD Finance source that is
           charged to an approved Treasury suspense account prior to home station departure.
           8.5.3.3.2. Aircrews shall complete the SF 44 and obtain the FBO fuel vendor
           annotation in block 11 of the SF 44 to confirm total cash amount and also sign and
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                     57


        date the SF 44 blocks 20 and 21. Aircrew shall return unused cash to their local DoD
        Finance source upon return to home station. Present the completed SF 44 (for non-
        fuel charges only) to the appropriate home station administrative personnel for
        processing (e.g., Wing Refueling Document Control Officer, Finance Office, etc.)
     8.5.3.4. Purchases of ground services and other approved products (not fuel).
        8.5.3.4.1. Complete a separate SF 44 for non-fuel purchases. Provide the FBO copies
        1 and 2 of the SF 44. The FBO shall use copy 1 and one copy of the FBO commercial
        invoice, if applicable, to directly bill/invoice the purchasing organization. Block 9 of
        the SF 44 shall reflect the organization name and address of the finance office
        responsible for payment to the FBO. The purchasing organization shall make
        payment to the FBO upon receipt of the invoice from the FBO.
        8.5.3.4.2. If the vendor presents their own form for signature and accepts the SF 44,
        write the statement "SF 44 Executed" on the vendor’s form.
        8.5.3.4.3. Turn in two copies of the SF 44 to the operations officer at home station.
     8.5.3.5. DD 1896 is the aircraft fuel and oil charge card normally used at military
     locations for refueling transactions.
     8.5.3.6. Present the aircraft identaplate for purchases at SITCO agreement locations.
     Make certain the invoice includes date of transaction, grade of product, quantity
     issued/defueled, unit of measure, and signature of Air Force member who accepted
     product. If vendor also requires completed SF 44 write statement, "AF FORMS
     EXECUTED‖ on vendor’s invoice.
     8.5.3.7. Purchasing Aviation Fuel in Canada. The DoD and Canadian Department of
     National Defense have signed a memorandum of understanding allowing DoD aircraft to
     use the DD 1896 when refueling at Canadian airfields with a Canadian National Defense
     Contract (CNDC). Use the MSC card for fuel purchases at Canadian airports without a
     CNDC, and for ground handling services at all Canadian airports.
     8.5.3.8. Use host country forms to effect purchases at foreign military airfields, including
     ―replacement-in-kind‖ locations. Hand scribe information from aircraft identaplate on the
     local form.
     8.5.3.9. For off-station missions, the PIC will complete or verify accuracy of the SF 44,
     AFTO Form 781H, DD1898, and associated fuels receipts. The PIC will transmit
     required information to home station via phone, fax, or message if mission causes
     him/her to be off-station past the last day of the month.

                                           Chapter 10

  AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND
                 NUCLEAR THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)
weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security threats to the global operations
of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRN threat, passive defense measures to
mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in a contaminated
environment. NOTE: Aircrew flying C-12 aircraft not modified/equipped to support the wear of
the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE) will treat the instructions in this chapter as
non-directive. However, all crew members are responsible for maintaining a thorough
knowledge of aircrew chemical operations/procedures.
10.2. Understanding the CBRN Threat.
   10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister,
   choking, and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on
   your side. The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates
   of chemicals all decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or absorb
   into surfaces. For decontamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5 percent
   bleach solution currently appears to be the best and most practical method of removing
   chemical agents that may remain as a contact hazard on glass, and unpainted metal.
   Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water. NOTE:
   Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed chemical warfare
   agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor hazards.
   10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into
   three areas: bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally
   susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms
   or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive
   and reproduce. Viruses and toxins do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the
   medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in ―flu-like symptoms‖ is
   actually a biological attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV rays, humidity and high/low
   temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life, lasting decades under
   the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help prevent
   infection.
   10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called ―dirty
   bomb,‖ is the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive
   material without using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and
   distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure.
   10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat, and
   radiation. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a nuclear detonation can
   damage electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of shielding, distance
   from the blast, and limited time of exposure.
 62                                                           AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008


10.3. CBRN Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities
conducted to negate, contain, and manage the effects of a CBRN attack. Passive defense
measures include pre, trans, and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRN threat
through contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.
   10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive
   defense measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: inflight diversion,
   survival launch, and minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground
   equipment (AGE), and material handling equipment (MHE).
      10.3.1.1. Inflight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRN
      attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if
      at all possible. Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the
      controlling OPORD
      10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every
      reasonable effort will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances,
      aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to
      the runway. In practice, this option may only be practical for aircraft that have just landed
      or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If launch is not possible, shut down engines
      and avoid running environmental control systems. Close aircraft doors/hatches/ramps,
      don Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal protective cover on the
      base. If time does not permit using base facilities, remain in the sealed aircraft for a
      minimum of one-hour after the attack and/or follow host-base guidance.
      10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly
      contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance
      and the use of protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly
      contaminated cargo requires special precautions and must be specifically authorized by
      the senior transportation commander.
   10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided,
   protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRN environment.
   Protection is afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection, and
   hardening of facilities.
      10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. The current in-flight protective gear for
      aircrew members is the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble. The ACDE includes the
      newer Aircrew Eye-Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) above the shoulders and the
      CWU-66/P or CWU-77/P Integrated Aircrew Chemical Coverall (IACC). The Ground
      Crew Ensemble (GCE) consists of the protective mask, C2 series canister (or filter
      element for MCU-2A/P protective mask), and over garment, boots, and gloves. The
      ACDE and GCE provide protection against chemical and biological agents. They do not
      provide blast or radiation protection from an RDD or nuclear detonation. The ACDE
      requires care during donning using "buddy dressing" procedures and Aircrew Life
      Support (ALS) expertise during processing through the Aircrew Contamination Control
      Area (ACCA). (Note: Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members (AECM) will utilize the
      MCU-2A series mask).
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                      63


         10.3.2.1.1. ACDE/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized ACDE and GCE at
         home station. Aircrews will ensure their ACDE and GCE are available at all times
         while in a CBRN threat area. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag
         contents and correct sizes.
         10.3.2.1.2. ACDE Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft contamination
         is unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations can represent the highest threat to
         aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents
         is paramount. Aircrew should limit activities to essential duties only, and separate
         ground duties from air duties.
     10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled,
     contamination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE
     such as the ACDE. The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is to
     employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. The intent is to provide rest and
     relief accommodations, as well as provide medical treatment in contamination free zone.
     Aircraft should not be used as a primary collective protection facility. However, if used,
     all pressurization systems should be shut down and doors sealed if the crew finds itself in
     need of immediate protection.
     10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to
     strengthen buildings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To
     reduce the potential of vapor exposure, personnel should consider the use of facilities
     above the first floor.
  10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control
  measures limit the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through
  disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations.
     10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene
     practices, and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive
     measures.
     10.3.3.2. Inflight Decontamination. Air washing is a useful inflight decontamination
     technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal surfaces. However,
     vapor hazards may remain in areas where the airflow characteristics prevent complete
     off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at
     least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower altitudes are more effective than higher
     altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as
     possible to maximize the airflow in and around as many places as possible. Be advised
     that exterior contamination may seep into the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for
     aircrews. Use of ACDE is recommended.
         10.3.3.2.1. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and
         equipment may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated
         assets will be restricted to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US
         government control.

10.4. Flight Operations.
   10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of CBRN
   weapons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should emphasize
   ACDE wear, crew coordination, CBRN hazards and countermeasures, inflight diversion,
   plans for onload/offload in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return leg in the
   event of aircraft contamination. Alternative scenario plans should also be considered in the
   event MOPP conditions change.
   10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control
   channels to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alert
   condition. Diversion of aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless
   operational necessity otherwise dictates.
   10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions
   as the result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized.
   Although the aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot,
   thus restricting the aircraft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
   10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen
   requirements. Aircrew wear of ACDE will require use of the aircraft oxygen system to
   counter actual/suspected contamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting offers the
   greatest protection in a contaminated environment. Appropriate oxygen quantity must be on
   board to meet higher consumption rates. Use the aircraft flight manual charts to calculate the
   required quantity.
   10.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACDE based on the alarm condition (See
   Airman’s Manual (AFMAN 10-100). Use the "buddy dressing" procedures. When wearing
   the ACDE, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors will be kept in the upper left ACDE
   pocket. If the integrated survival vest/body armor is worn, the Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride
   auto injectors may be kept in the lower right flight suit pocket. This standardized location
   will enable personnel to locate the medication should an individual be overcome by CWA
   poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight suit will facilitate detection of liquid chemical agents and
   ACCA processing. M-9 paper should be placed on the flight suit prior to entering the CBRN
   threat area or when an alarm ―yellow‖ or higher has been declared. When inbound to a
   CBRN threat area, prior to descent, the aircraft commander will ensure crew and passengers
   don appropriate protective equipment IAW arrival destination's MOPP level and brief
   aircrew operations in the CBRN threat area. As a minimum, this briefing will include: flight
   deck isolation, oxygen requirements, air conditioning system requirements, IPE
   requirements, ground operations, and MOPP levels. Aircrew members must determine if the
   wear of the integrated survival vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility
   to the point that it becomes a safety issue. If the aircrew deems the equipment to create a
   safety of flight concern, then the items may be pre-positioned (instead of worn) on the
   aircraft to be readily available to the aircrew.
   10.4.6. Communicating Down-line Support. Pass aircraft and cargo contamination
   information through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be
   used to determine if a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed.
   Report the physical condition of any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and
   whether they are wearing chemical defense ensembles.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                     65


10.5. Ground Operations.
   10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a
   contaminated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-flight
   crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to
   entering crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-
   flight briefings. Then, they will report to the ACCA for processing and ACDE donning with
   assistance from ALS personnel. If possible, aircrew transport should be provided in a
   covered vehicle. Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to departure to prevent
   contamination spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they will require
   assistance from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective overcape and
   overboots prior to entering the aircraft.
   10.5.2. Onload and Offload Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
   contamination spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the
   flight deck area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine
   covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic
   bags. Aircrew members entering the aircraft will remove plastic overboots and overcape
   portions of the aircrew ensemble and ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and
   placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to entering the aircraft all personnel should implement boot
   wash/decontamination procedures. Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated environment
   will don plastic overboots and overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
   10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete
   ACDE, complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker or the
   aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required.
   10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from a
   contaminated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in
   theater war plans. Onload cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the
   aircraft. If contaminated, protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing
   the cargo on the aircraft. It is the user's responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air
   shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly contaminated cargo requires the approval
   of the senior transportation commander.
   10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the
   ground transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading
   passengers/patients. MAJCOMs will establish their own policies for transportation of
   externally contaminated patients and those infected with contagious biological agents.
   10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems
   resulting from physical exertion while wearing ACDE. The aircraft commander should
   consider factors such as ground time, temperature and remaining mission requirements when
   determining on/offload capabilities. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for
   adverse physiological effects.
   10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize thermal
   stress caused by wearing the ACDE. Aircrews must weigh all factors when performing in-
   flight and ground duties. The following are degradation factors for wearing full GCE, and
   may also be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers for the ACDE. To estimate how
 66                                                           AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008


   much time it takes to perform a task or operation, (1) take the Task Time Multiplier (Figure
   10.1) for the appropriate Work Rate and ambient air temperature and (2) multiply it by the
   time it normally takes to perform the task. For example, given a heavy work rate and an air
   temperature of 70F, the crewmember should expect a normal one hour task to take 2.1 hours
   while wearing ACDE. A more extensive discussion of this subject is found in AFMAN 32-
   4005, Personnel Protection and Attack Actions.

Figure 10.1. Task Time Multipliers
 Work Rate         Temperature
                   20-49 F     50-84 F          85-100 F
                   -6 to 9 C   10 to 28 C       29 to 38 C
 Light             1.2         1.4              1.5
 Moderate          1.3           1.4            3.0
 Heavy             1.7           2.1            5.0

   10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with
   actual/suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke
   and Fume Elimination procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close
   inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9
   detection paper. Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor
   hazards. Above the shoulder ACDE should only be removed if there is absolutely no vapor
   hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the detectable levels of currently
   fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The aircrew must take
   every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on the flight deck
   area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid those areas for the
   remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an aircrew member or
   passenger has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will
   stay in full ACDE/ GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area
   (CCA). Upon arrival, the contaminated aircraft will be parked in an isolated area and
   cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground personnel.
   10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an
   aerospace vehicle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological,
   biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X will be entered and an annotation will be made
   in historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment.
   10.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for
   protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in
   locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a
   safety factor that goes beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE
   whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases
   associated with the 10-foot rule.
         10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4
         whenever they stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                  67


     seconds. This MOPP level provides personnel the maximum protection from the
     chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
     10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves of a sort
     (i.e. leather, rubber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated
     equipment. Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent
     may still be present. The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact with
     agent residue is avoided.

                               NAVIGATION PROCEDURES

11.1. Mission Planning.
   11.1.1. Flight Plan. A pilot will cross-check the computer flight plan planned route against
   the route of flight entered on the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan or DD Form 1801, DoD
   International Flight Plan, and the approved diplomatic clearance.
   11.1.2. RNAV(GPS) approaches based on true or grid are allowed during night or IMC
   provided the printed RNAV(GPS) procedure includes all required magnetic heading
   information, the procedure is in the aircraft database and all other normal RNAV(GPS)
   requirements are met (RAIM, current database, etc.).
11.2. Flight Progress. Use the following procedures for flight progress:
   11.2.1. Prior to flight on oceanic flights, plot the oceanic portion on an appropriate chart and
   compute Equal Time Point (ETP) returns due to a medical emergency (2 engine at cruise
   altitude), loss of pressurization (2 engine at 10,000 feet), and loss of one engine (one engine
   at drift down altitude). NOTE: The differences in the two-engine normal and single-engine
   LRC profiles are significant. Therefore, special attention during mission planning should be
   given to determining turnaround point if required due to engine loss.
11.3. Navigational Aid Capability.
   11.3.1. Airspace and associated navigational aid equipment capability are continually
   evolving. Pilots must maintain a thorough knowledge of current FLIP requirements/policies.
   11.3.2. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM is
   applied is considered special qualification airspace (FL290-FL410). Both the operator and
   the aircraft must be approved for operations in these areas. Refer to FLIP AP 1/2/3 for theater
   unique information. The C-12 is not currently certified/approved for flight in RVSM
   airspace.
   11.3.3. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. Airspace where RNP is applied
   is considered special qualification airspace. RNP airspace is being incorporated around the
   world to increase air traffic capacity by decreasing separation requirements between routes.
   Pilots will immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
   RNP-10 airspace and coordinate a plan of action. Document in the aircraft forms
   malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment.
   11.3.4. RNP-10. Navigation accuracy is within 10 nm of track 95% of the time.
   Remote/Oceanic operation in RNP-10 airspace is authorized provided that all required
   equipment is operational and adequate GPS coverage is available. The GPS coverage must be
   checked using the Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) software prior to departure. If the
   FDE software verifies satellite availability and the predicted Horizontal Integrity Limit (HIL)
   is within tolerances for the airspace (e.g. less than 10 NM for RNP-10 airspace), then the
   flight is authorized. If sufficient satellite coverage for FDE is not available or the HIL is
   greater than airspace tolerances, then the flight is not authorized.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                   69


  11.3.5. Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) Airspace. Airspace where BRNAV is applied is
  considered special qualification airspace. BRNAV meets a track keeping accuracy equal or
  better than +/- 5 NM for 95% of the flight time. Minimum equipment to operate in BRNAV
  airspace is an approved GPS with Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM)
  provided that the system is monitored by the flight crew and that in the event of a system
  failure, the aircraft retains the capability to navigate relative to ground based NAVAIDs (i.e.
  VOR, DME, and NDB). Pilots will immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment
  fails after entry into BRNAV airspace and coordinate a plan of action; however, with
  sufficient NAVAID reception, the C-12 may still operate in the BRNAV airspace. Document
  in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment.
  11.3.6. FM Immunity (FMI). The C-12 (EFIS modified) is equipped with dual FMI VHF
  navigation receivers and is considered fully compliant with no restrictions. Refer to the
  applicable Area Planning (AP) series for more information concerning FMI operations.

                 AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT PROCEDURES

12.1. General. This chapter contains aircrew procedures not contained in the flight manual,
other portions of this AFI, or other publications.
12.2. Responsibilities. Aircrew may assist the normal maintenance function when critical
contingency tasking dictate their use, provided this action does not impact crew duty and crew
rest limits specified in Chapter 3 of this AFI.
12.3. Authority to Clear a Red X. Pilots are not normally authorized to clear a Red X. If a
situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are
not available to clear it, the PIC may obtain authorization to clear the Red X from the owning
MXG/CC or OG/CC. Other crew members are not authorized to clear a Red X.
12.4. Aircraft Servicing. Aircrew are not normally required to service the aircraft; however,
they are qualified and authorized to perform those aircrew maintenance support tasks found in
this volume. The aircrew performs these tasks only in the absence of qualified maintenance
personnel and is designed for support of the aircraft and its mission while away from home
station. Without exception, the applicable checklists will be used during all refueling and de-
fueling operations.
   12.4.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform
   refueling duties. Aircrews will only refuel in cases when maintenance support is not readily
   available and the mission would be delayed.
   12.4.2. Concurrent servicing is not authorized for C-12 aircraft.
   12.4.3. The dash one preflight inspection will remain valid until either:
       12.4.3.1. 72 hours from the time of inspection, or
       12.4.3.2. Another maintenance dash six preflight inspection is performed.
   12.4.4. Fire Protection and Crash Rescue. A fire bottle, if available, should be positioned
   near the front of the aircraft prior to starting engines.

                          CARGO AND PASSENGER PROCEDURES

13.1. General. A pilot coordinates loading or offloading with air terminal operations or the
shipping agency; plans loads; provides in-flight services to passengers; and supervises on-
loading or off-loading operations.
13.2. Responsibilities for Aircraft Loading.
   13.2.1. At locations with AMC air terminal facilities, aerial port personnel are responsible
   for selecting cargo and mail for airlift, completion of documentation, preparation of cargo for
   air shipment, and moving cargo to and from the aircraft to meet scheduled departure.
   13.2.2. At locations without AMC air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes
   responsibilities and provides sufficient qualified personnel and handling equipment for
   loading or offloading.
   13.2.3. The PIC is responsible for aircraft preflight, load planning (as required) of all cargo,
   preparing weight and balance documentation; operating aircraft equipment; tiedown, and
   checking the cargo against manifests. The PIC supervises and directs on/offloading and is
   responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of the aircraft
13.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. No part of the cargo load will extend over the aisle.
NOTE: All passenger hand carried items must fit under the seat and not obstruct the aisle. Any
item that does not meet this requirement will be secured so as not to obstruct the aisle.
13.4. Preflight Duties.
   13.4.1. Passenger Missions. Maximize seat availability. It may be necessary for crews to
   perform passenger service functions at stations that do not have this capability. These
   functions include manifesting, anti-hijacking processing, and ensuring visa/passport
   requirements are met. File a copy of the passenger manifest with the most responsible on-
   scene agency if there is no base operations or other agency responsible for filing the
   manifest.
       13.4.1.1. All passengers, regardless of age, are required to be assigned their own seat.
       13.4.1.2. Passengers are limited to 30 pounds of baggage unless specific allowance for
       excess baggage is pre-coordinated with the PIC. Passengers with excess baggage may be
       transported after the PIC determines the aircraft weight limitations and mission
       requirements are satisfied.
   13.4.2. Passenger may hand carry a Department of Transportation approved Infant Car Seat
   (ICS) aboard the aircraft to use in assigned seats. The ICS will be secured to the seat using
   seat belts. The pilot in command is the final authority in determining if the ICS is adequately
   secured. NOTE: Vest and harness type child restraint systems, and lap held child restraints
   are not approved for use in the aircraft. Adults may hold infants under the age of two in lap
   for any critical phase of flight. In the event of turbulence or an emergency landing, it is
   highly recommended for infants to be secured in an ICS. Sponsors will decide where infants
   will be positioned during these instances.

   13.4.3. Every effort shall be made to transport passengers with disabilities who are eligible
   to travel. Passenger service personnel and crewmembers will assist in loading, seating, and
   unloading disabled passengers. Travel may be disapproved by the chief of travel at the
   passenger travel section or the PIC if there is an unacceptable risk to the safety of the
   disabled passenger, other passengers, crew, or if operational necessity/equipment or
   manpower limitations preclude accepting disabled passengers.
      13.4.4. Download the baggage of no-show passengers and those removed from a flight.
   13.4.5. Passenger Operation of Emergency Exits. Prior to each flight, a pilot will formulate a
   passenger emergency egress plan. Only English-speaking, physically able adults (age 15 and
   older) will be seated next to the emergency exit. The intent of this is to ensure those
   passengers seated next to the emergency exit are aware of their duties and responsibilities in
   assisting the crew during emergency egress.
13.5. Weight and Balance. Accomplish weight and balance for this aircraft according to
T.O.1-1B-50, Weight and Balance, and T.O. 1C-12-1 procedures. The unit possessing the
aircraft maintains the primary weight and balance handbook containing the current aircraft status
and provides a supplemental weight and balance handbook for each aircraft.
13.6. Loaded Weapons. Weapons are considered loaded if a magazine or clip is installed in the
weapon. This applies even though the clip or magazine is empty.
   13.6.1. Personnel who will engage an enemy force immediately upon arrival (actual combat)
   may carry basic combat loads on their person. Weapons will remain clear with magazines or
   clips removed until immediately before exiting the aircraft.
   13.6.2. Personnel who will not immediately engage an enemy force will store basic
   ammunition loads in a centralized location, as directed by the PIC, for redistribution upon
   arrival at the objective.
13.7. Cargo Validation Onloading and Offloading Procedures. Proper cargo or mail
documentation will accompany each load.
13.8. Procedures for Airlifting Hazardous Cargo.
   13.8.1. The term "hazardous cargo" as used in conjunction with airlift operations, applies to
   the following classes and types of materials covered by AFMAN 24-204:
         13.8.1.1. Class 1 (Explosives).
         13.8.1.2. Class 2 (Compressed gas).
         13.8.1.3. Class 3 (Flammable liquid).
         13.8.1.4. Class 4 (Flammable solid).
         13.8.1.5. Class 5 (Oxidizer and organic peroxide).
         13.8.1.6. Class 6 (Poison and infectious substances).

     Inform the agency that ―hazardous materials" are onboard and verify hazardous
     materials/cargo message has been received. Request information is relayed immediately
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                    75


     to base operations or the civil airport manager, crash and fire protection agency, and other
     support activities. If landing at a United States civil airport without a tower, provide
     information to the nearest FAA flight service station. Transmit the following
     information:
        13.8.4.4.1. Mission number, ETA, class of hazardous material, DoD class or division
        for explosives, NEW, gross weight, and special handling requirements (e.g. isolated
        parking, security, technical escort teams, etc.).
     13.8.4.5. DoD requires aircraft carrying DoD class or division 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3
     explosives, hazardous class or division 2.3 or 6.1 zone A materials, and munitions to be
     parked in areas isolated from non-associated personnel and facilities. When such cargo is
     aboard, the PIC is responsible for ensuring the cargo is correctly identified to the tower or
     ground control. If the aircraft is not directed to an isolated area, identify the cargo again
     to tower or ground control. When identification is acknowledged, the host is solely
     responsible for selecting the parking area.
     13.8.4.6. The military host is responsible for placarding aircraft. When missions operate
     on non-military bases, the briefing to the PIC will include placarding requirements and, if
     required, placards will be furnished at the on-load base. The shipper and receiver must
     make prior arrangements with the airport manager for shipments of hazardous materials
     requiring placarding. The shipper and receiver are responsible for cargo identification,
     fire fighting procedures, and isolated parking requirements.
     13.8.4.7. Unscheduled Landing Due to In-flight Emergency. Transmit unclassified
     information to the appropriate ATC facility as follows:
        13.8.4.7.1. Nature of emergency and intent to land.
        13.8.4.7.2. Aircraft position and ETA.
        13.8.4.7.3. Number of personnel and location in aircraft.
        13.8.4.7.4. Fuel on board.
        13.8.4.7.5. Hazardous materials aboard, location of the cargo, and information listed
        in paragraph 13.8.4.5.1.
     13.8.4.8. After Unscheduled Landing. Contact the appropriate C2 center by telephone,
     HF radio, or message, giving arrival notice, hazardous materials information, and other
     pertinent information, as required.

                                         FUEL PLANNING

14.1. General. This chapter provides general C-12 fuel planning considerations and procedures.
14.2. Fuel Conservation. Do not carry extra fuel for convenience.
14.3. Fuel Planning/Management. IAW AFI 11-202V3 and the following:
      14.3.1. Required ramp fuel will consist of all fuel required for engine start, taxi, takeoff,
      climb, cruise, alternate/missed approach (if required), descent, approach, transition, landing,
      and fuel reserve (holding fuel). Plan fuel load using computer flight plan or AF Form 70,
      Flight Plan, Table 14.1, and the flight manual (fuel plan not required on local missions
      remaining within 200 NMs).
      14.3.2. Alternate fuel is the fuel for flight from intended destination to alternate aerodrome
      at optimum altitude and normal cruise speed. Compute fuel, time, and altitude from T.O. 1C-
      12(A/F/J)-1. When holding is required in lieu of an alternate at a remote or island destination,
      compute holding for 1 + 15 hours using planned destination gross weight at FL 200. This
      provides 30 minutes holding fuel in addition to the 45 minute reserve requirement. A remote
      or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which, due to its unique geographic
      location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military). The forecast weather at the remote or
      island destination must meet the criteria listed in Chapter 6. NOTE: Additional fuel may be
      added to allow crews some flexibility when dealing with unplanned contingencies (e.g.
      weather avoidance, ATC delays, etc).

  NOTES:
  1. Include all planned off-course maneuvering for departure or en route deviations.
  2. When two alternates are required, fuel plan to the most distant alternate.
  3. Minimum fuel required over destination or alternate is fuel for holding plus approach and landing
  or 600 pounds (C-12 C/D/F) or 750 pounds (C-12J), whichever is greater.

     14.3.3. Emergency fuel is 550 pounds (C-12C/D/F) or 700 pounds (C-12J). Crews will
     declare ―emergency fuel‖ whenever it is determined that they will land with less than
     emergency fuel.
     14.3.4. Fuel Computations for Class II Routing. When flying along a Class II route, crews
     should ensure they have enough fuel to complete the flight from the equal time point (ETP).
     Consider worst case recovery with one-engine inoperative or two-engine unpressurized.
     NOTE: Crews must also ensure they have enough oxygen to continue from the ETP.

                              AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION

Section 20A—General Information

20.1. Mission. The primary function of operational support airlift (OSA) for aeromedical
evacuation (AE) is transport of ill or injured DoD members and their dependents for single
patient transfers requiring little or no medical support. These AE missions may be directed at any
time. OSA aircraft will only be used with the concurrence of the appropriate theater medical
validating authority.
20.2. Definitions.
   20.2.1. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). The movement of patients under medical supervision
   between medical treatment facilities (MTF) by air transportation.
   20.2.2. Aeromedical Evacuation Control Center (AECC). A medical element established to
   operate in conjunction with command and control centers (CCC). The AECC coordinates
   overall medical requirements with airlift capabilities and monitors patient movement.
   20.2.3. Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Member (AECM). Qualified flight nurse (FN) or
   aeromedical evacuation technician (AET) performing AE duties.
   20.2.4. Charge Medical Technician (CMT). An AET responsible for ensuring completion of
   enlisted medical crew duties.
   20.2.5. Global Patient Movement Requirements Center (GPMRC). Responsible for
   coordinating all patient movement once the mission arrives at the CONUS reception aerial
   port, ensuring the patients are continued to final destinations as appropriate, and notifying
   receiving MTFs of aircraft arrival time as well as types and numbers of patients to be
   offloaded.
   20.2.6. Medical Crew Director (MCD). An FN responsible for the supervision of patient care
   and medical crew assigned to AE missions. On missions where an FN is not on board, the
   senior AET will function as the MCD.
   20.2.7. Theater Patient Movement Requirements Center (TPMRC). Responsible for the
   coordination and requirements for patient movement from communication zone (COMMZ)
   to CONUS.
20.3. Deviations and Waivers. Waivers will process through theater C2 channels and first be
approved by the medical validating authority and then the appropriate MAJCOM.

Section 20B—Aeromedical Evacuation Command and Control

20.4. Operational Control (OPCON) and Reporting of Aeromedical Forces. OPCON of
aeromedical evacuation missions is the same as for other airlift missions.
20.5. Pilot in Command Responsibilities. The PIC is responsible for ensuring the safety of the
flight and aeromedical crew, patients, and passengers. In matters concerning flight safety,
decisions of the PIC are final. The PIC will:

   20.5.1. Brief the aeromedical crew on the mission, flight plan, flight profile, and current
   threat.
   20.5.2. Maintain cabin altitude at the level requested by the aeromedical crew.
   20.5.3. Coordinate with the MCD or senior AECM to determine if any flight restrictions
   (passenger, cargo, routing) are necessary due to patient conditions.
   20.5.4. Coordinate with the MCD or senior AECM to ensure mission-required equipment is
   available and installed as necessary.
   20.5.5. Advise the AECMs of intentions to start engines, taxi, itinerary changes, in-flight
   difficulties, etc.
   20.5.6. Transmit medical movement coordination messages.
   20.5.7. Coordinate crash and rescue unit requirements when transiting airfields that are
   unfamiliar with AE requirements. Crash and rescue will stand by according to AFPD 32-20,
   Fire Protection, and T.O. 00-125-72, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static
   Ground/Bonding.
20.6. Aeromedical Crew Responsibilities. The MCD or senior AECM is responsible for
providing medical care to the patients. In matters of patient care, decisions of the aeromedical
crew are final. The aeromedical crew will:
   20.6.1. Be primarily responsible for patient activities.
   20.6.2. Assist the flight crew with aircraft AE configuration.
   20.6.3. Install and remove medical equipment and supplies.
   20.6.4. Control patient rests with the MCD or senior AECM.

Section 20C—Aeromedical Airlift Operations

20.7. Determining Factors. Consider the following factors when transporting patients on OSA
aircraft: patient's diagnosis, condition, equipment, oxygen requirements, in-flight time, in-flight
patient care requirements, and the number of medical personnel required.
   20.7.1. Patients not normally transported on OSA aircraft include:
       20.7.1.1. Patients on a Stryker turning frame. The Stryker ―A‖ frame can be carried, but
       is not recommended due to the difficulty in onloading or offloading on some OSA
       aircraft.
       20.7.1.2. Patients with a high potential for seizure activity, combativeness, or who
       require constant suctioning.
       20.7.1.3. Unstable cardiac patients, cardiac patients requiring a cardiac monitor, and
       patients with a recent history of chest pains or requiring intravenous therapy en route.
       20.7.1.4. Patients with respiratory problems requiring large amounts of therapeutic
       oxygen, ventilator support, or frequent suctioning.
       20.7.1.5. Patients with contagious illnesses.
       20.7.1.6. High-risk neonates without special medical supervision from a neonatal team.
 86                                                               AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008


20.8. Patient Load Planning Factors. The AECC (GPMRC or TPMRC) determines size and
composition of patient load on AE missions. AE mission planning factors will be according to
applicable Air Force publications.
20.9. Patient Preparation. A flight surgeon, if available, will determine the patient's suitability
for aeromedical evacuation on the C-12 aircraft. If the MCD or senior AECM determines the
patient's medical condition is beyond the capability of the aeromedical crew or aircraft, contact
the theater AECC (GPMRC or TPMRC) for further guidance. The MCD or senior AECM, in
coordination with the appropriate theater medical validating authority, may refuse to accept any
patient whose medical condition is beyond their capability. The MCD or senior AECM will
advise the PIC when a patient's condition or use of medical equipment may affect aircraft
operation.
20.10. Patient Death in Flight. When a death or suspected death of a patient occurs in flight,
the planned itinerary will not be interrupted if the next scheduled stop is a military airfield. If the
next stop is a civilian or foreign military airfield, that stop will be overflown (mission
requirements allowing). Coordination with command and control channels is essential.
20.11. En Route Diversions.
   20.11.1. The MCD or senior AECM is the medical authority on board all AE missions and
   has the responsibility to determine what is beneficial or detrimental to the patients.
   20.11.2. Should a diversion become necessary due to a change in patient's condition, the PIC
   will make every effort to comply with the requests of the MCD or senior AECM. Establish
   communications with the responsible C2 which in turn, will relay the information to the
   appropriate AECC (GPMRC or TPMRC).
   20.11.3. Should an en route diversion become necessary for reasons other than change in
   patient's condition, the PIC will coordinate with the MCD or senior AECM before deciding
   the course of action. Welfare of the patient is the prime consideration in all such decisions;
   however, crew and passenger safety is the final determinant. The PIC will notify the
   responsible C2 of the diversion and requests appropriate medical agencies be notified.
20.12. Ground Operations. Engines should be shut down during enplaning and deplaning of
patients. If possible, park aircraft so that doors used for enplaning and deplaning are upwind or
on the windward side of the aircraft. Remaining exits may be closed, but not locked.
20.13. Aircraft Pressurization. Normally, altitude restrictions are passed from the AECC
(GPMRC or TPMRC) to C2 channels for flight planning purposes. The MCD or senior AECM
will advise the pilot of cabin altitude or rate of cabin altitude change restrictions during the
preflight briefing.
   20.13.1. Therapeutic oxygen is not available on the aircraft and must be brought on board
   for patient use.
20.14. Aircraft Configuration. The AECC (GPMRC or TPMRC) MCD or senior AECM
determines the size and composition of the patient load on board AE missions. Load planning
will be according to guidelines for the C-12 aircraft. There are provisions for two litter patients
on C-12F aircraft and five on the C-12J aircraft.
AFI11-2C-12V3 14 APRIL 2008                                                                  87


20.15. Passengers and Cargo. With the concurrence of the MCD or senior AECM, the PIC
will ensure maximum aircraft usage for passengers and cargo. Passenger restrictions based on
patient considerations will be identified when seats are released.
20.16. Crash Coverage and Fire Protection. Aircraft carrying patients will be provided crash
and fire protection according to AFPD 32-20. Stand-by is not necessary during normal
operations.
20.17. AE Call Sign and Use of Priority Clearance. Only use the AE priority when carrying a
sick or seriously injured patient who requires urgent medical attention. The patient need not be
classified ―urgent‖. Only use AE priority for that portion of the flight requiring expedited
handling. Pilots should request priority handling if AE missions are experiencing long delays
during takeoff or landing phases that will affect a patient's condition.
20.18. Load Message. At military bases, the flight crew will pass inbound load messages to
proper C2 personnel. At civilian airfields, notify ground control.

20.19. Adopted Forms.

Double Blocking—When an aircraft is required to block-in at one parking spot, then move to
normal parking for final block-in. The extra time required for double blocking will be taken into
account during mission planning/scheduling. To compensate for double blocking on departure,
the aircrew "legal for alert time" may be adjusted to provide additional time from aircrew "show
time" to departure. When double blocking is required on arrival, the aircrew entry into crew rest
will be delayed until postflight duties are complete.
Due Regard—Operational situations that do not lend themselves to International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) flight procedures, such as military contingencies, classified missions,
politically sensitive missions, or training activities. Flight under "Due Regard" obligates the
military pilot in command to be his or her own air traffic control (ATC) agency and to separate
his or her aircraft from all other air traffic. (See FLIP General Planning, section 7).

Operational Control (OPCON)—Transferable command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is
inherent in combatant command (command authority). Operational control may be delegated and
is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving
organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and
giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes
authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to
accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through
the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is exercised through
subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or functional component commanders.
Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and forces and to
employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary to accomplish
assigned missions. Operational control does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction
for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training.

airport on a permit to proceed issued by customs officials at the first port of entry. This permit
lists the requirements to be met at the next point of landing, i.e. number of crew and passengers,
cargo not yet cleared. Pilots in command are responsible to deliver the permit to proceed to the
customs inspector at the base where final clearance is performed. (Heavy monetary fines can be
imposed on the pilot in command for not complying with permit to proceed procedures).
Point of No Return—A point along an aircraft track beyond which its endurance will not permit
return to its own or some other associated base on its own fuel supply.
Point of Safe Return—Most distant point along the planned route from which an aircraft may
safely return to its point of departure or alternate airport with required fuel reserve.
Positioning and De—positioning Missions—Positioning missions are performed to relocate
aircraft for the purpose of conducting a mission. De-positioning missions are made to return
aircraft from bases at which missions have terminated.

reducing ground times at en route or turnaround stations.
Pseudorange—The distance from the user to a satellite plus an unknown user clock offset
distance. With four satellite signals it is possible to compute position and offset distance. If the
user clock offset is known, three satellite signals would suffice to compute a position.
Raven Team—Flyaway Security Forces team tasked with protecting aircraft/aircrew.
Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM)—A technique whereby a GPS
receiver/processor monitors the GPS. This integrity determination is achieved by a consistency
check among redundant measurements.
Scheduled Return Time (SRT)—Scheduling tool used by air mobility units to predict when
crews will return to home station. It allows force managers to plan aircrew availability and
provide crews visibility over monthly flying activities. AMC and AMC-gained aircrews (except
those on standby at home station) will have an SRT established on their flight orders.
Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET)—Area weather advisory issued by an
ICAO meteorological office relayed to and broadcast by the applicable ATC agency. SIGMET
advisories are issued for tornadoes, lines of thunderstorms, embedded thunderstorms, large hail,
severe and extreme turbulence, severe icing, and widespread dust or sand storms. SIGMETs
frequently cover a large geographical area and vertical thickness. They are prepared for general
aviation and may not consider aircraft type or capability.
