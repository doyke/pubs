SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
updates all Grading Area Tables to reflect AFSOC/CV direction to maximize utilization of
aircrew training devices, and clarifies evaluation procedures for BAQ crewmembers attaining
mission qualification. Chapter 2, Evaluation Requirements, deletes C-130E/H aircraft; it
follows the guidance of AFI 11-202 V2 for grading criteria and Form 8/8A completion.
Chapter 3, Instructor Evaluations, clarifies grading criteria for periodic Mission evaluations of
Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ)-only instructors. Chapter 4, Pilot/Co-pilot Evaluations,
aligns non-precision approach criteria with other C-130 series, and aligns precision approach
tolerances with flight standards. Chapter 5, Navigator Evaluations, was changed to update
guidance for qualification, initial mission, and recurring qualification/mission (QUAL/MSN)
evaluations and to update grading criteria in areas 107, 116, 118, and 125. Chapter 6, Fire
Control Officer (FCO) Evaluations, was updated to reflect current and updated equipment in the
aircraft. Chapter 7, Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) Evaluations, was changed to update
periodic QUAL/MSN guidance and grading criteria in areas 151 and 152. Chapter 8, Flight
Engineer Evaluations, allows more flexible timing for area 215. Chapter 10, Loadmaster
Evaluations, eliminates the basic qualification prerequisite for mission evaluations. Chapter 13,
Special Mission Aviation Evaluations, was added to implement the new 1A9XX Special
Missions Aviation AFSC and to provide evaluation criteria for loadmasters and aerial gunners
who have completed cross-utilization training.

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Objectives. The Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Program is the commander’s tool
to validate mission readiness and the effectiveness of unit flying, to include documentation of
individual aircrew member qualifications and capabilities.
1.2. General. This instruction establishes requirements and grading criteria for ground and
flight phases of initial and periodic flight evaluations. All AC-130H/U Special Operations
Forces (SOF) aircrew evaluations will be conducted in accordance with (IAW) this instruction
and AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, as supplemented. Specific
areas for evaluation are prescribed to ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency and
capabilities of aircrews. Flight examiners use this AFI when conducting aircrew evaluations.
Instructors use this AFI when preparing aircrews for qualification. Air Force Special Operations
Command (AFSOC) is Lead MAJCOM for AC-130H/U operations.
1.3. Applicability. This instruction applies to all individuals performing crew duties on
AC-130H/U aircraft.
1.4. Key words and definitions.
     1.4.1. “Will” and “Shall” indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.4.2. “Should” is used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.4.3. “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.4.4. “Note” indicates operations procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
     emphasize.
1.5. Waivers. IAW AFI 11-202V2, AF/A3OT is the waiver authority for the USAF aircrew
standardization and evaluation programs. Waiver authority for the contents of this document is
MAJCOM Director of Operations, A3 for individual aircrew requirements. Submit requests for
waivers to this instruction through Standards and Evaluation channels to HQ AFSOC/A3V. Post
all waivers to this instruction in the individual’s flight evaluation folder behind Tab 2.
Document waivers IAW AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented.
1.6. Supplements. Units are encouraged to supplement this instruction with standard evaluation
profiles that best fit the unit’s mission, equipment, and location. Using MAJCOMs will forward
their supplements to AF/A3O-AI, through HQ AFSOC/A3V, for approval prior to publication.
Units below MAJCOM level will forward one copy of each supplement to their MAJCOM OPR
for prepublication review.
1.7. Evaluation Procedures. During the crew briefing, the evaluator will inform the aircraft
commander of any special requirements. Flight examiners will brief the examinee on the
conduct, purpose, and requirements of the evaluation, as well as all applicable evaluation criteria,
prior to flight. The examinee will accomplish all required mission planning. If an Operations
Planning Team or Deployment Planning Team accomplishes mission planning, the examinee is
ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all mission-planning paperwork.
AFI11-2AC-130V2 7 MARCH 2013                                                                     7


Flight examiners will be furnished a copy of necessary charts, flight logs, mission folders, and
any additional items they deem necessary. The flight examiner should not occupy a primary
crew position during evaluations to ensure the most comprehensive evaluation. If conditions
warrant, however, the flight examiner may occupy a primary crew position during an evaluation.
   1.7.1. Flight examiners will ensure all required training and documentation is complete prior
   to initial/requalification evaluations.
   1.7.2. The examinee will be current for all events evaluated during a recurring evaluation.
   1.7.3. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations,
   but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.
   1.7.4. Flight examiners will thoroughly debrief/critique all aspects of the flight. During the
   critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations,
   area/subarea grades assigned, and any additional training required.
1.8. Grading Instructions. All evaluations will follow the guidelines in AFI 11-202V2, as
supplemented, and this volume. Examiners will use the criteria in this volume to accomplish all
flight, simulator, and emergency procedures evaluations. To ensure standard and objective
evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with prescribed evaluation criteria.
   1.8.1. Area/Subarea Grades. Areas/subareas will have a two-level (Q/U) or three-level
   (Q/Q-/U) grading system. Discrepancies will be documented against the listed subareas.
       1.8.1.1. Q. ‘Q’ indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of all
       required information and performed aircrew duties within the prescribed tolerances.
       1.8.1.2. Q-. ‘Q-’ indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned
       area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the
       flight examiner. Deviations must not exceed prescribed ‘Q-’ tolerances, jeopardize flight
       safety, or breach flight discipline.
       1.8.1.3. U. ‘U’ indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters, thereby
       compromising flight safety; that deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
       adversely affected mission accomplishment; and/or evaluated performance constituted a
       breach of flight discipline. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade of ‘U’ requires
       debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the flight examiner.
   1.8.2. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew
   member in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. If an aircrew member
   receives an unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will
   also be unqualified. Critical areas are identified by “(Critical)” in the area title.
1.9. Evaluation Requirements. Evaluation profiles will reflect a sampling of the unit’s
missions. Evaluation tables are provided to summarize evaluation areas. Areas common to all
crewmembers are contained in Table 2.1. Instructor evaluation areas are in Table 3.1.
Evaluation areas unique to each crew position are located in their respective chapter. Each crew
specific chapter defines required events. Events required in-flight only, and/or in simulators,
and/or alternate methods (see paragraph 1.9.1 below) will be identified in the crew specific
tables. For any areas without a note, flight examiners may evaluate at their discretion if
observed. If required events are not observed, then the evaluation is incomplete and will be
accomplished on another flight. If a required event cannot be accomplished, the evaluator will

place a restriction on the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, or AF Form 8A,
Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple Aircraft), as applicable.
     1.9.1. Simulator. Weapon System Trainers (WSTs) with a C or greater certification (or
     Training Value Code (TVC) of 3 or greater for all areas evaluated as determined by simulator
     certification (SIMCERT)) may be used to accomplish evaluations. Simulator certifications
     will be located at the AFSOC/A3T website. Use the prefix SIM to indicate evaluation was
     administered in the simulator or Aircrew training Device (ATD). All Instrument (INSTM)
     evaluations may be accomplished in certified simulators. Do not conduct two consecutive
     Qualification (QUAL), Mission (MSN), or combined QUAL/MSN evaluations in the
     simulator. Initial (INIT) MSN and special qualification evaluations must be accomplished in
     the aircraft. EXCEPTION: Squadron Commander may, on a case-by-case basis, approve
     completion of INIT MSN evaluations in the simulator IAW paragraph 1.9.1.1 below, if the
     SQ/CC determines sufficient events were accomplished in flight.
        1.9.1.1. Evaluations requiring multiple sorties may be completed via different methods,
        so long as specific events are evaluated IAW paragraph 1.9 above. Document multiple
        sorties IAW AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented. Document in the comments section of AF
        Form 8/8A which portion(s) of the evaluation were conducted in the simulator.
     1.9.2. Alternate Method. When it is impossible to evaluate an area in flight due to
     equipment malfunctions, operational requirements, scheduling restrictions, etc., the area may
     be evaluated via alternate method (procedural trainer, or verbal examination) unless noted in
     the crew specific chapter. If, in the flight examiner’s judgment, an item cannot be adequately
     evaluated by an alternate method, complete the evaluation on an additional flight. Document
     in the comments section of AF Form 8/8A which portions of the evaluation were conducted
     via alternate method. EXCEPTION: Certain items listed in Table 2.1 and Table 3.1 may be
     evaluated via alternate method without additional Form 8/8A comments.
     1.9.3. Grading Criteria. To the maximum extent possible, flight examiners will use the
     grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area grades. Exercise judgment when
     the wording of areas is subjective and when specific areas are not covered. Flight examiner
     judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade. Consider cumulative
     deviations when determining the overall grade.
        1.9.3.1. Base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable
        aircraft. In some cases, momentary deviations are allowable provided the examinee
        applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying safety.
1.10. Unsatisfactory Performance. If the flight examiner observes an aircrew counterpart
jeopardizing safe flight, the examiner will assume the duties of that aircrew member (provided
the examiner’s flight duty period does not exceed AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules,
maximum flight duty period for an unaugmented crew). This does not mean the examiner must
assume the examinee's position any time unsatisfactory performance is observed. If the
examiner feels the examinee can continue safely with supervision, the examiner is not required
to assume the examinee's duties. However, if the flight examiner assumes the examinee's duties,
a Qualification Level 3 (Q-3) will be assigned as the overall grade.
     1.10.1. Evaluators    must    report   deviations/discrepancies   from   established
     procedures/directives in any area, regardless of the individual's crew specialty, to
AFI11-2AC-130V2 7 MARCH 2013                                                                    9


   squadron/group commander for evaluation and necessary action in accordance with AFI 11-
   202V2, as supplemented.
1.11. Additional Training. Flight examiners are responsible for assigning additional training,
at their discretion. Document additional training and completion IAW AFI 11-202V2, as
supplemented. Any approved training device or medium may be used for additional training.
   1.11.1. Additional training may be accomplished on the same flight as the evaluation, when
   unique situations present valuable training opportunities (i.e., crosswind landings). However,
   this option requires flight examiner discretion and judicious application. The examinee must
   be informed when the additional training begins and ends.
1.12. Rechecks. Rechecks will normally be administered by a flight examiner other than the
one who administered the original evaluation.
1.13. Special Qualifications. Special qualification evaluations are administered for events that
are not universal to all members in that crew position. Special qualification evaluations may be
conducted separately or in conjunction with QUAL/MSN evaluations. There are no requisites
for special qualification evaluations unless specified. Refer to the appropriate crew position for
any special qualification evaluation requirements.
   1.13.1. Special qualifications result in an AF Form 8/8A. Special qualification evaluations
   are SPOT evaluations IAW AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented. Further description of the
   specific event evaluated will be included in the mission description section of the comments
   block of the AF Form 8/8A. Although a unit may maintain 100 percent of its crew members
   qualified, this documentation is still required due to interfly and permanent change of station
   issues.
1.14. Basic Aircraft Qualification. Units may maintain crew members in Basic Aircraft
Qualification (BAQ) status as required. Evaluations and documentation for BAQ crew members
will be IAW AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented, and this instruction.
1.15. Multiple Qualifications. Aircrew members maintaining BAQ in multiple C-130 aircraft
require one periodic QUAL evaluation. Crew positions, evaluation requirements, and approval
authority are IAW AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented.

                             EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General. The general criteria contained in this chapter apply to all crew positions and all
evaluations. Use criteria and table in the appropriate crew position chapters for evaluations.
   2.1.1. All evaluations will follow guidelines in AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented, and Table
   2.1 in this volume. This table depicts specific grading areas that apply to all crew position
   evaluations; Table 3.1 applies to all instructor evaluations.
   2.1.2. Administer aircrew evaluations on any flight that as scheduled will accomplish all
   required items for that evaluation. Mission evaluations should be as realistic as possible with
   minimum of simulated events. Do not deviate from peacetime restrictions.
2.2. Requirements.
   2.2.1. Evaluate all crew members with guidance in the following subparagraphs, Table 2.1,
   and crew-specific chapters and tables. For instructor evaluations, also see Table 3.1.
   2.2.2. Examinations. All crew members will complete open and closed book examinations
   as a requisite to periodic evaluations. Except for pilots, all mission-qualified crew members
   will complete combined periodic QUAL/MSN examinations. Pilots must complete separate
   open and closed book examinations as requisites to periodic QUAL and MSN evaluations.
   Conduct requisite examinations IAW AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented.
   2.2.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). EPEs are requisites for all flight
   evaluations. EPEs may be conducted verbally, in-flight, in a simulator, or by another method
   determined     by the      examiner     or   unit    Stan/Eval.         Operations     Group
   Standardization/Evaluations (OGVs) may develop EPE guides for flight examiner use in
   each crew position. EPEs should be scenario-driven, and tailored to the specific crew
   position. The EPE will include areas commensurate with the examinee's qualification and
   experience level. Emphasize emergency procedures and systems knowledge. Examiners
   should include other general knowledge areas as well. For mission evaluations, evaluate
   mission-specific equipment and situations. EPEs will include sufficient inflight and ground
   emergencies to evaluate the examinee's knowledge of systems and procedures to the flight
   examiner's satisfaction.
       2.2.3.1. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in-flight. The
       examinee must recite all BOLDFACE items from memory and should provide the initial
       steps of emergency procedures that, in the opinion of the examiner, would not allow time
       for reference.
       2.2.3.2. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs for
       all crew positions. The flight examiner will assign an overall EPE grade (1, 2, or 3) in
       the Qualification Ground Phase block of the AF Form 8/8A, regardless whether all or a
       portion of the EPE was performed in-flight. EXCEPTION: For BOLDFACE use
       grading criteria in Area 4.
2.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). In accordance with AFI 11-290,
Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, CRM skills will be evaluated during
AFI11-2AC-130V2 7 MARCH 2013                                                                 11


initial and periodic evaluations. CRM skills are integral to all phases of flight; therefore no
specific area titled CRM exists. CRM skills are imbedded within specific grading criteria
(mission planning, airmanship/situational awareness, crew coordination, communication, risk
management/decision making, task management, and briefing/debriefing) and include all of the
skills listed on the AF IMT 4031, CRM Skills Criteria Training/Evaluation Form. Therefore,
use of the AF IMT 4031 is unnecessary for evaluations.
2.4. Formal Course Evaluations. Fly syllabus evaluations IAW syllabus mission profile
guidelines if stated, or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training objectives. All
required areas must be evaluated for the type of evaluation being flown, IAW guidance in this
volume. Grade training objectives and related areas using the performance criteria in this
volume. Formal course guidelines may be modified, based on local operating considerations or
examiner judgment, to complete the evaluation.
2.5. 14th Weapons School. Evaluations of 14th Weapons School personnel will conform to
guidance in AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented.
2.6. Currency of Flight Publications. Use Area 12 criteria of General Areas. Required flying
publications are specified in AFI 11-2AC-130V3, AC-130 Operations Procedures.
2.7. General Grading Criteria.

     lighting configuration, arresting cable placement, instrument procedures or TO
     limitations require an adjustment to the desired touchdown point, a simulated runway
     threshold will be identified and the grading criteria applied accordingly. For instrument
     approaches, the examinee should utilize a normal glide slope from either the decision
     height or from a point where visual acquisition of the runway environment is made.

5.1. General. Mission qualified Navigators require QUAL and MSN evaluations. Examinees
must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform all navigator duties safely and effectively,
including the operation of appropriate aircraft systems, IAW applicable TOs and directives.
5.2. Requirements. Refer to Chapter 2 for all evaluations. Instructors will demonstrate
instructional ability on all periodic evaluations; refer to Chapter 3 for instructor evaluation
grading areas and criteria. Navigator specific areas are listed in this chapter.
5.3. Requisites. Requisites for all navigator evaluations include Open and Closed book
examinations (or formal school end-of-course examinations if applicable), BOLDFACE
examination, and EPE. The various navigator evaluations are described in following paragraphs.
   5.3.1. Qualification Evaluations. After completion of the appropriate training, navigators
   may receive a QUAL evaluation enabling them to fly non-mission sorties. Thereafter, they
   require, at a minimum, recurring QUAL evaluations. See grading event criteria in Chapter
   2, Chapter 3, and Table 5.1, Notes 4 and 5 for required QUAL evaluation areas.
       5.3.1.1. AC-130H navigators require a QUAL evaluation in any C-130-series aircraft or
       certified ATD prior to the initial AC-130 mission evaluation. AC-130U navigators
       require a QUAL evaluation either in the AC-130U aircraft or WST prior to the initial
       AC-130 mission evaluation. Navigators transitioning from another AC-130 series may
       receive a combined QUAL/MSN evaluation in their new MDS.
   5.3.2. Initial/Re-qualification Mission Evaluation. Conduct INIT or RQ MSN evaluations
   on missions consisting of both live and dry fire missions. Comply with formal school course
   guidance if available. TOT criterion is to a point tangent to the orbit or as predetermined by
   the evaluator. See grading event criteria in Chapter 2, Chapter 3, and Table 5.1. A QUAL
   evaluation may be conducted in conjunction with the INIT or RQ MSN evaluation.
       5.3.2.1. For INIT or RQ MSN evaluations, AC-130U navigators require live offset, a dry
       fire profile, and TOT in addition to the periodic requirements listed below.
   5.3.3. Periodic Qualification/Mission Evaluation. Conduct the QUAL/MSN evaluation in
   the eligibility period corresponding to the earliest expiration date. QUAL/MSN evaluations
   will include required areas in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 (if applicable), and Table 5.1.
       5.3.3.1. For AC-130H, a live fire is desired, but not required. Verbally evaluate live fire
       procedures if not accomplished in-flight. TOT criterion is to a point tangent to the orbit
       or as predetermined by the evaluator.
       5.3.3.2. For AC-130U, navigators require, at a minimum, live fire procedures using the
       Radar as a sensor and demonstrating combat tweak (or two-shot procedures), calls-for-
       fire (using either peacetime or combat distances and procedures), and fuel management.
       TOT is desired.
