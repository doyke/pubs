SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It changed from
a 94 AW Instruction to a Dobbins ARB Instruction. This revision incorporates changes from the
current AFI 10-245 (30 Mar 2009). Electronic recording of RAM’s will be utilized to the fullest
extent.
1. General: The implementation of RAM’s changes the security atmosphere surrounding an
installation. A comprehensive and well-developed RAM program will alter the external
appearance and security footprint of the installation to terrorists, their supporters who may be

providing surveillance assistance, and criminal elements. RAM programs confront a terrorist or
criminal group with an ambiguous and unpredictable situation that will complicate their planning
processes for attacks. RAM’s test elements of the security system to include Force Protection
Conditions (FPCON) measures. As such, they provide training to installation personnel, allow
us to evaluate their security effectiveness and determine logistical requirements for FPCON and
various security and contingency actions. RAM execution shall be broad based and involve a
variety of career fields and personnel. Further this program is in compliance with DoD standard
14 from DoDI 2000.16 and will implement the RAM program according to DoD O-2000.12-H
and is applicable to all units on this installation. The RAM program will be included in the
current AT Plan 10-245; integrated with all FPCON’S (including FPCON NORMAL), as listed
in DoD O-2000.12-H “DoD Antiterrorism Handbook” and DoDI 2000-16 “DoD Antiterrorism
(AT) Standards” which will ensure continuity and standardization among the Air Force should
threats require United States Air Force-wide implementation.
2. Concept of Operations: During every FPCON, to include FPCON NORMAL, RAM’s will
be selected from higher FPCON measures and locally derived measures. Generally speaking,
RAM’s will be derived from the next two higher FPCONs for implementation in the current
FPCON. For example, in FPCON ALPHA, RAM’s will generally be selected from FPCON
Bravo and Charlie. However, RAM’s from FPCON NORMAL are not to be discounted and are
encouraged at any FPCON. Additional RAM’s that are not FPCON measures may be developed
and added to the listing of RAM’s. The number of RAMs conducted within a specific time frame
shall be at the discretion of the Installation Commander.
     2.1. RAM’s may be implemented at any time regardless of the current threat posture at the
     discretion of the Installation Commander.
     2.2. RAM’s can be used in conjunction with FPCON changes, Crisis Action Checklists and
     other contingency actions.
     2.3. Additional Antiterrorism measures will be incorporated in plans for functions such as
     change of commands, open house, and organized off-base activities.
3. Procedures: The process in which RAM’s will be implemented:
     3.1. RAM’s will be implemented in a purely random manner during every FPCON level to
     include FPCON NORMAL so that times for implementation, location and duration will be
     regularly changed to avoid predictability. In addition to RAM’s approved by the Integrated
     Defense Council (IDC), Unit Antiterrorism representatives (UATRS) should conduct specific
     RAM’s that are relevant to their facilities, surroundings and possible threat. The key to an
     effective the installation RAM program is the diversity of the schedule and the support of
     individual work centers tasked to perform them. The UATR will work with the Facility
     Manager to insure compliance with the required RAM’s.
     3.2. A listing of RAM’s will be continuously reviewed and/or developed by the Installation
     Antiterrorism Officer (ATO) and/or Antiterrorism Working Group (ATWG). The RAM
     listing will be revalidated by the Integrated Defense Council (IDC) at least semi-annually and
     must be endorsed by the 94 AW/CC.
     3.3. The Installation Antiterrorism Officer will develop a RAM schedule using the approved
     RAM listing. This quarterly RAM schedule will be forward to the 94 AW/CC for approval
     and signature. The RAM schedule will include for each RAM at a minimum the following:
DOBBINSARBI10-245 14 APRIL 2011                                                              3


      3.3.1. A description of the RAM to be completed.
      3.3.2. The date the RAM is to be completed.
      3.3.3. The work centers tasked to perform the RAM.
      3.3.4. The frequency of the RAM if it is to be conducted more than once.
      3.3.5. The RAM schedule may direct the time the RAM is to be conducted or just specify
      the date, depending on the nature of the RAM.
      3.3.6. Any additional instructions or requirements will be posted with the schedule.
   3.3.7. All Dobbins ARB units/tenants will comply IAW DoD 2000.16, Antiterrorism (AT)
   Standards.
4. UATR Responsibilities: The UATR will keep a RAM log (electronic recording is
acceptable and encouraged) to record the necessary information. The Installation ATO will
compile data from each unit’s RAM log and record electronically. The 94 SFS/BDOC will
record specific RAM’s and fence line checks in the daily blotter.
   4.1. Should special needs arise, tasked organizations and work centers will perform their
   RAM’s as ordered by the 94 AW/CC and record the necessary information on the UATR
   RAM log. Pertinent information concerning the time, location, and results of the RAM will
   be recorded in the log.
      4.1.1. The UATR will notify the ATO by e-mail providing all necessary information
      after completing the tasked RAM(s) and recorded in the unit log. The UATR will
      provide the following information: unit performing the tasks, the task number, building
      number, time and duration of the task and any findings. If while performing a RAM an
      observation(s) of concern is made; contact the 94 SFS/BDOC at 655-4908/4909
      immediately.
      4.1.2. If the RAM cannot be performed, the tasked organization will contact the
      Installation ATO by e-mail and provide all necessary information why the RAM could
      not be completed. Notification of why the RAM could not be completed should be made
      by the next working day.
      4.1.3. The Installation ATO will conduct random visits to organizations tasked to
      perform RAM’s to provide guidance and assistance in conducting their RAM’s and to
      evaluate the effectiveness of each.
      4.1.4. The Installation ATO will monitor, track and analyze RAM implementation efforts
      and provide the appropriate feedback to the Installation Commander.

access this share must be submitted via CAC signed email or a letter to the 94 AW/ATO.
