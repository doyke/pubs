Dover Air Force Base Instruction (DAFBI) 21-106, Crash-Damaged/Disabled Aircraft
Recovery (CDDAR): Developed to provide the basic procedures to be followed for physical
aircraft recovery/removal of a crash/disabled aircraft after all initial response events have been
accomplished IAW FSTR 10-2, Full Spectrum Threat Response, OPLAN 32-2, Standby Emission
Plan, and OPLAN 91-2, Mishap Investigation Plan, Physical aircraft removal procedures will
not be implemented until approved by the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS)
with concurrence of the Safety Investigation Board (SIB) president. This instruction outlines
policy and establishes responsibility and procedure guidelines to support an effective Crash
Recovery Program. Note: Unless your work center is a part of the initial response element (IRE)
of the Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, it remains in
a standby mode until directed by the Incident Commander (IC) to proceed to the accident site as
a part of the follow-on element (FOE) of the EM. The composition of the IRE and the FOE is
clearly stated in AFMAN 32-4004, Chapter 2, Emergency Response Operations. Additionally,
the local response procedure is directed in the 436 AW FSTR 10-2. Unless requests for
respondents are covered (tasked) in one of these documents, the AFIMS, or other pertinent
authority, considers the consequences of deviations. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-
363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the Air
