4. AED Locations and Installation.

   4.1. The essential key to surviving a cardiac arrest is early access, early CPR, early
   defibrillation and early advanced care. Therefore, to provide the capability of early
   defibrillation, AEDs must be strategically placed throughout the organization.

   4.2. A facility site assessment should be accomplished to determine the number of AEDs
   necessary as well as their placement within a building. The PAD Medical Director will have
   final approval for placement of the AEDs taking into account the factors listed below:

      4.2.1. Facility size and/or accessibility

      4.2.2. Number of employees in the facility

      4.2.3. Identified high-risk environments

      4.2.4. Number of people that may have public access to the facility on a daily basis

      4.2.5. Emergency response protocol already in place for a facility; keep in mind it is the
      time of initial shock that really matters

   4.3. In order to achieve complete area coverage within a building, an AED should be
   positioned no more than 1 minute's travel time (one way) from any given point within the
   building.

   4.4. Optimal response time, from the identification of a person "down" to the arrival of AED
   on-scene, is 3 minutes or less.

   4.5. Optimal response time from the identification of a person down to the delivery of a
   shock (i.e., drop-to-shock) should be less than 5 minutes.

   4.6. The current location of AEDs on Maxwell AFB is listed in Attachment 8. This list also
   contains location of AEDs at sister locations at the 117 MDG in Birmingham and 187 MDG
   at Dannelly Field. The PAD Program Medical Director, in conjunction with the cardiac life
   support function (CLSF), will recommend placement of additional AEDs as needed, as well
   as accept and evaluate requests from individual units. The list will be updated accordingly
   by the PAD Program Coordinator.

5. Implementation.

   5.1. Trained individuals will use AEDs to revive an unresponsive person prior to arrival of
   medical personnel.

   5.2. AEDs are not to be used by any person who has not been trained to use the device.

   5.3. Placement of the AED within a building and security of the device are the responsibility
   of the site coordinator. Placement should reasonably prevent access by non-trained
6                                            MAXWELLAFBI41-102            7 NOVEMBER 2013

    individuals (tampering/horseplay). However, quick and easy access to the device is essential
    in the event of an emergency. Selection of a monitored location is suggested if practical.

6. Acquisition and Maintenance.

    6.1. Procurement of AEDs, reusable supplies and local maintenance operations (pads and
    battery changes as recommended by the manufacturer) and costs are the responsibility of the
    intended owner. All purchases must be coordinated in advance with the Medical Equipment
    Management Office (MEMO)/(42 MDSS/SGSL) and approved by the Medical Director.
    MEMO will ensure uniformity of equipment to facilitate acquisition, training, use and
    maintenance/repair. The Medical Director will present the request to the CLSF for
    review/recommendation prior to approval. All AED units obtained outside the approval of
    the Medical Director of the PAD and CLSF are the responsibility of the owner of the unit.

    6.2. The BMET Element is the point of contact for site coordinators and manufacturer’s
    representatives concerning any problems with AEDs. Additionally, BMETs are responsible
    for any inspections or maintenance beyond the site coordinator’s ability to perform using the
    manufacturer owner’s manual. To assist the site coordinator, BMETs will issue written
    guidance for routine maintenance, inspections and post-use procedures.

    6.3. All new requests for AEDs will be accomplished utilizing the AED Request Letter
    (Attachment 9) and coordinated through the Medical Director, CLSF, BMET and Medical
    Logistics. Procurement of funding will be a unit responsibility. The Medical Logistics
    Flight will be the focal point for all AED acquisitions.

7. Quality Assurance. The Medical Director or designee and the CLSF will review all Event
Summary Sheets to assess the quality of care and will make recommendations for program
improvement as appropriate.

8. Documentation.

    8.1. Use the Maxwell AFB Form 13 to record information of the event after the actual use of
    the AED. The questions in the blocks are filled out using victim and by-stander’s
    information obtained using blue/black ink. Only one copy is required per event. When used,
    the site coordinator turns the Maxwell AFB Form 13 over to the PAD Program Director.

    8.2. Site coordinators use the Zoll AED Monthly Inspection to perform monthly inspections
    of their units. Sites using the Cardiac Science AED and Phillips AED will use the
    appropriately designated form according to Attachments 5 and 6, respectively. Each month,
    the site coordinator will fill out these forms, answering the questions in the boxes and
    annotating the correct answer using blue/black ink. Only one copy is required per year per
    AED and will be maintained with the AED.
