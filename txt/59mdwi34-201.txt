SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Changed facility name and fundraising locations. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised
material.
1. Responsibilities.
   1.1. The 59 MDW Wing Commander (59 MDW/CC) is responsible for identifying the non-
   workplace areas of Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center (WHASC).
   1.2. The 59 MDW Vice Wing Commander (59 MDW/CV) is responsible for approving or
   denying all requests for fundraising events.
 2                                                            59MDWI34-201 3 AUGUST 2009


     1.3. Facilities Management (MLRS/SGSKF) is responsible for the reservations of all
     fundraising events at the clinic and chapel location to ensure there is no conflict between
     different events.
     1.4. The command section is responsible for the reservations of all fundraising events at the
     Atrium and Patio. Atrium CCES @ 292-5999 and Patio CCCE @ 292-7015.
     1.5. 59 MDW personnel are responsible for complying with this publication and the
     guidelines in the DoD 5500.7 R Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), AFI 36-3101, Fundraising
     Within the Air Force and AFI 34-223, Private Organization (PO) Program. Failure to
     adhere to the proper procedures may result in suspension of fundraising privileges and other
     actions as deemed appropriate by the 59 MDW/CC.
2. Personnel Authorized.
     2.1. Organizations composed of military members and civilian employees may raise funds
     from among their own members for organizational support or for the benefit of their
     members. These organizations can be either chartered Private Organizations (PO) (such as
     the Top Three Association) or unofficial activities/organizations (such as unit “sunshine” or
     snack/coffee funds), as defined in AFI 34-223.
     2.2. Unofficial activities/organizations whose assets exceed a monthly average of $1,000
     over a three-month period must become a PO in accordance with AFI 34-223. The 37th
     Services Division is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for the establishment of a PO.
     Whether held by a PO or unofficial activity/organization, occasional fundraising events must
     comply with the requirements of AFI 36-3101 and AFI 34-223. AFI 34-223 defines
     “occasional” sales for fundraising purposes as being not more than two events per calendar
     quarter.
3. Designated Areas.
     3.1. Fundraising events aimed at those outside the organization may be held at the locations,
     designated in paragraph 3.2 as WHASC “non-workplace” locations, only with the pre-
     approval of the proper authority.
     3.2. At WHASC, the designated non-workplace locations for purposes of fundraising and for
     food/toy collection are as follows:
        3.2.1. The main entrance atrium/first floor.
        3.2.2. The clinic entrance/first floor.
        3.2.3. The area in front of the chapel in the basement.
        3.2.4. The Patio.
4. Prohibited Dates for Fundraising.
     4.1. The Air Force conducts two annual fundraising campaigns at the workplace: the
     Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) and Air Force Assistance Fund (AFAF) Campaign. No
     other fundraising by a non-Federal entity may be conducted within the workplace.
     4.2. During the annual AFAF and CFC campaigns, there will be no fundraising in non-
     workplace areas by POs or unofficial activity/organization, unless the fundraising event is
     otherwise legal and is approved by the 59 MDW/CC. In all such specially approved
59MDWI34-201 3 AUGUST 2009                                                                        3


   fundraising events, the donor must have the option of designating his/her donation to a
   specific participating CFC or AFAF organization or be advised that the donation will be
   counted as an undesignated contribution and distributed according to Office of Personnel
   Management (OPM) regulations.
5. Fundraising During Duty Hours.
   5.1. Air Force members may support fundraising activities as individuals as long as they do
   nothing that implies Federal endorsement and do not do so while on duty (i.e. must be on
   leave or a normal day off, or shift worker prior to scheduled duty time).
       5.1.1. The participants must be in civilian clothes.
       5.1.2. Only volunteers who are members of the fundraising organization may participate
       in the fundraising.
       5.1.3. Supervisors will not give time off for personnel to engage in a fundraising event,
       nor will “comp-time” be granted before or after the event.
   5.2. Golf tournament fundraising events may be held during duty hours, but organizers and
   participants must be on leave, pass, or otherwise in a legitimate non-duty status. This is
   distinguishable from command-sponsored and funded golf tournaments, where personnel
   may participate in duty status.
   5.3. Although it is 59th Medical Wing Policy to limit fundraising activities to one day, in
   rare cases, the 59 MDW/CC or designee can approve events up to three days.
6. Unauthorized Types of Fundraising. Fundraisers involving games of chance, lotteries,
raffles, or other activities involving gambling are strictly forbidden. Under Texas law, gambling
is illegal. Gambling is any time someone pays to win or lose something of value solely or
partially by chance. It does not include an offer of a prize, award, or compensation to the actual
contestants in a bona fide contest for the determination of skill, speed, strength, or endurance or
to the owners of animals, vehicles, watercraft, or aircraft entered in a contest; or for a chance to
receive a prize. Note: If a person purchases a ticket for an event, that is not construed as
gambling if a door prize could be received because the individual has already received an item of
value (admission to the event).
7. Equipment/Materials. POs and unofficial activities/organizations are only authorized
minimal logistical support. According to AFI 34-223, the PO may not use government-owned
consumable items such as cups, napkins, plates, and other items that will not be returned to the
government’s inventory in the same condition as when removed. Other items or equipment such
as tables, chairs, and food warmers may be used so long as the use does not result in appreciable
depreciation in the value of the item and does not impact the mission. Organizations may not
publicize their fundraising events via e-mail and may not otherwise use government time,
equipment, or supplies to announce their event. Flyers made at no expense to the government
may be distributed throughout WHMC, but they must be distributed by off-duty
personnel/employees only in authorized areas. The flyers may only be posted on approved
bulletin boards but not in the elevators.
8. Approval Process. POs or unofficial activities/organizations seeking to conduct a
fundraising event in WHASC must first obtain the approval of 802d Services Division. Next, the
event must then be coordinated with Facilities Management (MLRS/SGSKF) or Command

Section (depending on location), which will authorize the use of the space and de-conflict with
other planned events. Finally, 59 MDW/CV must approve the request. Requests must be
submitted early enough to allow 59 MDW/CV at least five (5) duty days to review the request.
A sample request form is attached. The approval documentation must be displayed in a
conspicuous place during the fundraising event.
