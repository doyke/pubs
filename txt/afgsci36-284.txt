1. Background. The TOP HAND program was established by Headquarters Strategic Air
Command (HQ SAC) in 1972 to select the command’s best missileers to conduct the
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Follow-On Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) Mission and
to prepare these board-selected officers for follow-on assignments to HQ SAC. Through the
program TOP HAND officers were provided in-depth exposure to all ICBM weapon systems and
provided a number of unique professional and staff officer development opportunities. Over the
last 30 years, the program itself has remained relatively unchanged, despite a number of
organizational changes including transition of the program to Air Combat Command and later to
Air Force Space Command (AFSPC). With the creation of a space test capability, AFSPC
expanded the TOP HAND program to include the best space and missile operators from 2001 to
2                                                       AFGSCI 36-284 1 DECEMBER 2009

2009. This instruction establishes the TOP HAND program for selected professionals conducting
the Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) mission for ICBMs within AFGSC.
2. Definition. TOP HAND is an AFGSC sponsored program that selects, trains and develops
officer personnel with exceptional job performance and proven leadership skills necessary to
execute critical ICBM systems testing. The dynamic and challenging nature of testing demands
top performers to evaluate, validate, and improve our war fighting capabilities. TOP HAND
personnel complete a rigorous program designed to develop comprehensive weapon system and
OT&E expertise beyond the scope of their current Air Force specialty code (AFSC).
Additionally, TOP HAND provides opportunities and experiences designed to promote
professional development consistent with Air Force Leadership and Force Development
Doctrine. The TOP HAND program builds skills associated with the tactical and operational
levels of leadership, as well as acquisition, resource and program management, staffing, critical
thinking and communication. TOP HAND personnel complete the program with increased
leadership ability, as well as depth & breadth of ICBM system expertise.
3. Selection. TOP HAND is a selectively-manned program. TOP HAND positions are board-
selected, providing personnel to the 576 FLTS to conduct testing vital to the command’s
warfighting mission. The 576 FLTS/CC will identify TOP HAND billets within the squadron.
3.1. Eligibility Criteria.

squadron.

results announcement.
4. Training. To produce experts qualified in OT&E, the 576 FLTS at a minimum provides
training in: test planning, execution, analysis, acquisition and program management. The
program utilizes existing AF courses when possible. The 576 FLTS conducts initial unit training
followed by a dynamic advanced ICBM training program.
