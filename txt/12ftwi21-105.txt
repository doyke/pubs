                                            Chapter 2

                                POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

2.1. General Information. Timely completion of FCF/OCF sorties and HST checks is
extremely important. FCF/OCF sorties and HST checks take priority over student training and
Instructor Development missions. FCF/OCF sorties and HST checks will normally be conducted
no later than the end of the next duty day following notification by 12 FTW/MXOQI or 12
FTW/MXQC, excluding weather delays.
2.2. FCF Policies and Procedures. FCFs will be flown when dictated by the applicable aircraft
Dash-6 series technical orders or when directed by the 12 FTW Director of Maintenance (DOM)
in consultation with subordinate 12 FTW/MX agencies and with 12 OG and/or 479 FTG
representatives.
     2.2.1. (JBSA-Randolph) A full-profile FCF for T-38C aircraft will normally be
     accomplished during the initial FCF sortie (fuel permitting), regardless of the reason for the
     FCF. Re-attempt sorties may be flown as a full or partial profile, as deemed appropriate by
     the T-38C Lead FCF Pilot or Chief, 12 OG/FCF.
     2.2.2. Full-profile FCFs on T-1A and T-6A aircraft will be minimized and are only flown as
     required by MDS Dash-6 Series Technical Orders or for FCF Pilot Upgrade/Currency. In
     these cases, full-profile FCFs will be coordinated with 12 FTW/MXI as necessary.
        2.2.2.1. Refer to Attachments 2 and 3 of this instruction for additional guidance on T-1A
        FCF sorties conducted for reasons other than specified in T.O. 1T-1A-6.
     2.2.3. Current FCF Pilots will accomplish all FCF checklist actions. Current 12 FTW
     assigned/attached MDS Instructor Pilots may fly on MDS FCF sorties to assist the FCF Pilot,
     but will not directly perform any FCF checklist actions. During T-6A and T-38C FCF
     sorties, the FCF Pilot will occupy the front cockpit. The FCF Pilot may occupy either the left
     or right seat during T-1A FCF sorties.
     2.2.4. FCF Weather Requirements. Weather requirements for conducting FCFs are IAW
     T.O. 1-1-300, in addition to any applicable MDS-specific requirements.
     2.2.5. Group FCF Chief Pilot MDS Inter-fly Authorization (FCF). The Chief, 12 OG/FCF
     and the Chief, 479 FTG/FCF may fly on any respective Group FCF sortie, provided all
     required life support and egress training is current for the MDS. If the Group FCF Chief
     Pilot is not also a qualified MDS FCF Pilot, the Group FCF Chief Pilot will occupy the rear
     cockpit on T-6A and T-38C FCF sorties and the jump seat on T-1A FCF sorties .
2.3. OCF Policies and Procedures. In addition to criteria published in AFI 21-101, and IAW
T.O. 1-1-300, OCFs will be flown when FCF requirements do not apply and operational
maintenance checks cannot be performed adequately on the ground, test equipment is not
available, or when directed by the 12 FTW DOM, in consultation with subordinate 12 FTW/MX
agencies and with 12 OG and 479 FTG representatives.
     2.3.1. OCFs must be coordinated with 12 FTW/MXOQI or 12 FTW/MXQC and will follow
     the same procedures as FCFs (i.e. scheduling, Quality Assurance AFTO 781 forms review,
     etc.) All responsibilities outlined in Chapter 1 of this instruction apply.
12FTWI21-105 5 JUNE 2012                                                                      7


   2.3.2. OCF sorties will normally be accomplished by current FCF Pilots. Exception: OCFs
   may be accomplished by current, experienced 12 FTW assigned/attached MDS Instructor
   Pilots with Chief, 12 OG/FCF or Chief 479 FTG/FCF approval. Note: the term OCF
   (Operational Check Flight) is not to be confused with a request from 12 FTW/MX for an in-
   flight operational check of non-critical aircraft systems or equipment. With Squadron
   Operations Supervisor approval, any MDS-qualified pilot may accomplish a 12 FTW/MX-
   requested in-flight check of non-critical aircraft systems or equipment.
   2.3.3. OCF Weather Requirements. OCFs will be conducted during day VMC conditions.
   Minimum weather for an OCF sortie is 1500-foot ceiling and 3 statute miles of visibility.
   The Squadron Supervisor can waive this requirement for OCF sorties when the aircraft is
   known to be operational for flight under IMC and IFR conditions, and when failure of the
   component or system to be checked would not affect the IMC and IFR operation of the
   aircraft. Minimum weather is then IAW T.O. 1-1-300, in addition to any applicable MDS-
   specific requirements.
   2.3.4. Group FCF Chief Pilot MDS Inter-fly Authorization (OCF). The Chief, 12 OG/FCF
   and the Chief, 479 FTG/FCF may fly on any respective Group OCF sortie, provided all
   required life support and egress training is current for the MDS. If the Group FCF Chief
   Pilot is not also a qualified MDS Instructor Pilot, the Group FCF Chief Pilot will occupy the
   rear cockpit on T-6A and T-38C OCF sorties and the jump seat on T-1A OCF sorties. See
   paragraph 2.3.2. for further information.
2.4. High-Speed Taxi (HST) Check Policies and Procedures. HST checks may be utilized
when maintenance operational checks require the aircraft to be taxied higher-than-normal taxi
speeds. When possible, FCF/OCF sorties are preferred over HST checks. In addition to
compliance with Chapter 1 of this instruction, the following procedures will be accomplished
when conducting HST checks:
   2.4.1. Only aircraft which are considered completely airworthy will conduct HST checks. If
   airworthiness is undetermined, an FCF will be conducted in lieu of (or prior to) conducting
   HST checks.
   2.4.2. HST checks will only be conducted by a current, qualified FCF Pilots. Current 12
   FTW assigned/attached MDS Instructor Pilots may accompany 12 OG and 479 FTG FCF
   Pilots on MDS HST checks to assist the FCF Pilot, but will not directly perform any HST
   check actions. During T-6A and T-38C HST checks, the FCF Pilot will occupy the front
   cockpit. The FCF Pilot may occupy either the left or right seat during T-1A HST checks.
   2.4.3. Prior to stepping, the FCF Pilot(s) will compute TOLD for the highest speed expected.
   The FCF Pilot(s) will review MDS Flight Manual abort procedures and associated notes,
   warnings and cautions.
   2.4.4. (JBSA-Randolph) The FCF Pilot will notify JBSA-Randolph Tower, JBSA-
   Randolph SOF (Hangover Tower and Hangover SOF as appropriate) and the respective
   Squadron Operations Supervisor prior to performing the HST check. The FCF Pilot may
   request that the runway barrier be raised, if applicable, and in IAW MDS restrictions.
   2.4.5. (JBSA-Randolph) JBSA-Randolph SOF or Hangover SOF will coordinate with the
   Tower Watch Supervisor to ensure Crash, Fire and Rescue personnel are notified of the
   proposed HST check. Note: This is done merely to provide advance notification to Crash,
 8                                                                12FTWI21-105 5 JUNE 2012


     Fire and Rescue personnel. No further readiness posture beyond that of normal flying
     operations is required or expected.
     2.4.6. (NAS Pensacola) The FCF Pilot will notify NAS Pensacola Tower and the respective
     Squadron Operations Supervisor prior to performing the HST check. The FCF Pilot may
     request that the runway barrier be raised, if applicable, and in IAW MDS restrictions.
     2.4.7. (NAS Pensacola) The FCF Pilot will notify Crash, Fire and Rescue personnel of the
     proposed HST check. Note: This is done merely to provide advance notification to Crash,
     Fire and Rescue personnel. No further readiness posture beyond that of normal flying
     operations is required or expected.
     2.4.8. During HST checks, the following speeds shall not be exceeded:
        2.4.8.1. T-1A: 100 KIAS
        2.4.8.2. T-6A: 85 KIAS
        2.4.8.3. (JBSA-Randolph) T-38C: 120 KCAS or RS-BEO, whichever is lower.
     2.4.9. IAW AFI 21-101 the fuel load will be the minimum fuel practical to accomplish the
     High-Speed Taxi check, but not less than MDS Volume 3 and applicable Technical Order
     minimums. Factors to consider are the weight of the aircraft at the time the discrepancy was
     noted and fuel required to safely recover the aircraft when the possibility of becoming
     airborne exists.
     2.4.10. Following completion of the check, the FCF Pilot will taxi the aircraft clear of the
     runway. If no problems are noted by the FCF Pilot, the aircraft may be taxied to parking or
     returned to the runway for takeoff (if a subsequent FCF/OCF sortie is also required). If the
     check is being performed as part of an FCF/OCF flight, the FCF Pilot must ensure all takeoff
     and landing data is still valid following the High-Speed Taxi check.
     2.4.11. HST Weather and Runway Condition Requirements. The High-Speed Taxi check
     will only be performed during day VMC conditions and on a dry runway. Crosswinds will
     not exceed:
        2.4.11.1. T-1A: 15 knots
        2.4.11.2. T-6A: 10 knots
        2.4.11.3. T-38C: 15 knots
     2.4.12. Group FCF Chief Pilot MDS Inter-fly Authorization (HST). The Chief, 12 OG/FCF
     and the Chief, 479 FTG/FCF may accompany the MDS FCF Pilot on any respective Group
     HST check, provided all required life support and egress training is current for the MDS. If
     the Group FCF Chief Pilot is not also a qualified MDS FCF Pilot, the Group FCF Chief Pilot
     will occupy the rear cockpit on T-6A and T-38C HST checks and the jump seat on T-1A
     HST checks.
2.5. Fuel load for FCF/OCF sorties and HST checks. Full fuel load requirements are waived
for FCF/OCF sorties requiring full-stop taxi-backs for maintenance, as long as the subsequent
flight portions can recover with appropriate fuel reserves.
12FTWI21-105 5 JUNE 2012                                                                     9


2.6. FCF Conditional Release:
   2.6.1. If an FCF conditional release occurs (IAW AFI 21-101), the FCF Pilot(s) or
   maintenance personnel will add the discrepancy that caused the conditional release in the
   next available AFTO Form 781A block. Cross reference will be made to the FCF
   discrepancy using the “see page ___ item ___ format.” A second 781A discrepancy will be
   created stating: “FCF Pilot forms review required of maintenance action prior to FCF
   release.” Reference will be made to the conditional release discrepancy using the “see page
   ___, item ___ format.”
   2.6.2. Once the discrepancy is corrected, the appropriate maintenance supervisor will review
   maintenance actions performed and present the aircraft forms to the FCF Pilot for review. If
   the FCF Pilot is satisfied with the maintenance actions performed, the FCF Pilot may release
   the aircraft from FCF by clearing the forms review and FCF entries in the AFTO Form 781A.
   Another FCF or OCF may be flown if deemed necessary by 12 FTW DOM IAW paragraphs
   2.2 and 2.3 of this instruction.
2.7. Off-station FCF/OCF/HST procedures. When an aircraft is off-station and requires an
FCF/OCF/HST, and the aircraft MDS is not supported by the transient base, 12 FTW/MX
Maintenance Repair Teams (MRT) and 12 FTW FCF Pilots will follow their home-station FCF
procedures to the maximum extent possible.
   2.7.1. The MRT will:
      2.7.1.1. Contact home-station 12 FTW/MXOQI or 12 FTW/MXQC for guidance as
      necessary.
      2.7.1.2. Create a red dash entry in the AFTO Form 781A for the FCF/OCF/HST
      requirement, to include the reason, and a red dash entry for a forms review prior to
      FCF/OCF/HST.
      2.7.1.3. Ensure a current combined BPO/Pre-flight Inspection is accomplished.
      2.7.1.4. Review the aircraft forms for completeness and accuracy and clear the forms
      review in the AFTO Form 781A.
      2.7.1.5. Brief the FCF Pilot(s) on maintenance performed, to include the reason for the
      FCF/OCF/HST prior to flight and debrief the aircrew after flight. Ensure the FCF Pilot
      makes appropriate AFTO Form 781A entries and completes the FCF checklist as
      applicable. Leave the completed FCF checklist with the aircraft forms.
      2.7.1.6. Ensure home-station Quality Assurance is informed of mission status.
   2.7.2. FCF Pilot responsibilities during off-station FCF/OCF/HST:
      2.7.2.1. Ensure the appropriate 12FTW 232 is initiated prior to flight or HST check
      (contact home station to obtain the form, if necessary).
      2.7.2.2. Review the AFTO 781 forms and receive a brief and debrief with MRT
      personnel.
      2.7.2.3. (JBSA-Randolph) Ensure the completed 12FTW 232 is returned to 12
      FTW/MXOQI (see 12FTW 232 instructions).
 10                                                             12FTWI21-105 5 JUNE 2012


      2.7.2.4. (NAS Pensacola) Ensure the completed 12FTW 232 is returned to 479
      FTG/FCF (see 12FTW 232 instructions).
   2.7.3. Quality Assurance responsibilities during off-station FCF/OCF/HST.           12
   FTW/MXOQI or 12 FTW/MXQC will coordinate with the MRT and FCF Pilot(s) to provide
   guidance as necessary. When the aircraft returns to home station, 12 FTW/MXOQI or 12
   FTW/MXQC will review the FCF checklist for completeness and ensure all documentation is
   completed and filed per requirements.
2.8. FCF/OCF/HST requirements for transient aircraft located at NAS Pensacola or
JBSA-Randolph:
   2.8.1. If the aircraft is a supported MDS, follow local FCF procedures IAW this instruction,
   AFI 21-101 and Supplements in addition to AFI 11-2MDS Series publications.
   2.8.2. If the MDS is not supported locally, the owning unit will provide qualified
   FCF/OCF/HST maintenance and aircrew personnel. 12 FTW/MXOQI or 12 FTW/MXQC
   will coordinate with the owning unit and provide assistance as required/requested.
12FTWI21-105 5 JUNE 2012                                                                      11

       T-1A FCF PILOT CURRENCY AND “HEALTH OF FLEET” FCF POLICY

(JBSA-RANDOLPH)
A2.1. In addition to criteria specified in T.O. 1T-1A-6, T-1A FCF sorties will be conducted on a
targeted schedule of once per month.
A2.2. These sorties will be flown in order to fulfill the requirements of “health of fleet”
sampling and FCF Pilot training/proficiency while avoiding undue increase in the workload of
the 12th Maintenance Directorate.
A2.3. These sorties will be coordinated based on 12 OG/FCF and 12 FTW/MXI inputs and will
be identified on the weekly flying schedule. The intent is to fly full-profile T-1A FCF sorties for
aircraft with no recent FCF on record. When planning to accomplish T-1A FCF checklist items
which require extensive post-flight maintenance action, coordination will be made during the
scheduling process. Note: for these sorties, the requirements in paragraphs 1.1.1.1. - 1.1.1.4. of
this instruction are waived. In the event that the aircraft is non-released following this initial
FCF sortie, all procedures outlined this instruction will apply for subsequent FCF/OCF sorties or
HST checks.
A2.4. In the event that an FCF/OCF sortie is required for another T-1A aircraft in the normal
course of maintenance procedures, the option will exist for 12 OG/FCF and/or 12 FTW/MXI to
cancel (or otherwise utilize) the next scheduled monthly FCF sortie.
A2.5. The Chief, 12 OG/FCF will supervise the coordination and tracking of these monthly FCF
sorties and will retain the authority, in coordination with 12 FTW/MXI, to modify this targeted
schedule as necessary.
A2.6. Additional training FCF sorties for FCF Pilot currency will be scheduled at the squadron
level as needed. Checklist items requiring extensive post-flight maintenance on these sorties will
be avoided unless prior coordination is accomplished.

(NAS PENSACOLA)
A3.1. In addition to criteria specified in T.O. 1T-1A-6, T-1A FCF sorties will be conducted on a
targeted schedule of one every other month.
A3.2. These sorties will be flown in order to fulfill the requirements of “health of fleet”
sampling and FCF Pilot training/proficiency while providing a predictable schedule for the 12th
Maintenance Directorate.
A3.3. These sorties will be coordinated based on 479 FTG/FCF and 12 FTW/MXI inputs and
will be indentified on the weekly flying schedule. The intent is to fly full profile T-1A FCF
sorties for aircraft with no recent FCF on record. When planning to accomplish T-1A FCF
checklist items which require extensive post-flight maintenance action, coordination will be
made during the scheduling process. Note: for these sorties, the requirements in paragraphs
1.1.1.1. - 1.1.1.4. of this instruction are waived. In the event that the aircraft is non-released
following this initial FCF sortie, all procedures outlined this instruction will apply for subsequent
