OPR: 436 MSS/DPCE (Margie MacLeish)                   Certified by: 436 MSS/CC (Major Regina Hargett)
Supersedes AFI 36-815, DAFBS1,                                                               Pages: 7

AFI 36-815, 5 September 2002 is supplemented as follows: Implements and outlines Dover AFB pro-
cedures for requesting emergency annual leave, advance annual leave, restoration of annual leave, sick
leave to care for a family member with a contagious disease, advance sick leave and leave without pay in
excess of 30 days. The instruction identifies employees entitled to administrative leave and assigns the
Civilian Personnel Officer and the Labor and Employee Management Relations Section as the approving
official and office of primary responsibility for the Voluntary Leave Program.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
Paragraph numbers were changed to correspond to the September 2002 version of AFI 36-815. Paragraph
2.4.1. was updated to reflect current procedures for recording advance leave. Paragraph 2.10. was updated
to reflect correct form number and office designation. Paragraph 3.11b. changed “Civil Service Retire-
ment” to “retirement” contributions and updated AFI reference. Paragraph 3.11.1. combines former para-
graphs 3-5a.(4) and (5) and eliminates the need for 4 copies of the request letter. Paragraph 4.4.a. updated
AFI reference. Paragraph 4.4.b. clarifies process for Leave Without Pay (LWOP) greater than 30 days.
Paragraph 4.4.c. updated paragraph number and eliminated the 4 copy requirement. Paragraph 4.5. added
guidance for Leave Without Pay-Uniformed Services (LWOP-US). Paragraph 7.6.4. (Added) updated
paragraph to include current designations. Paragraph 9.5. eliminated “80 hour” reference, revised donated
leave processing and updated office designation. Updated formats on Attachment 5 (Added) and
Attachment 6 (Added). A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition.
2.4. When Annual Leave is Granted. The employee’s immediate supervisor is authorized to approve
annual leave in normal situations. When emergency annual leave is needed, the employee must contact
his/her immediate supervisor as soon as possible, but not later than the end of the first two hours of the
assigned work shift. The employee must request emergency annual leave and must state when he/she
expects to return to work. When the supervisor approves the leave, the approval is final, unless it is later
shown that the basis for the request was not correct. If additional time is requested, the employee must
again contact the immediate supervisor for approval.

2.4.1. Requests for advance annual leave (before it is earned) must be in writing and approved/disap-
proved by the immediate supervisor. The supervisor will retain a copy for his/her files and the timekeeper
will attach a copy to the employee’s Time and Attendance Form for appropriate retention. A copy of the
advance annual leave approval letter is forwarded to the Civilian Pay Liaison Office. If annual leave
granted in advance is not recorded on the Time and Attendance Form, payment will not be made. (See
Attachment 5 (Added) for sample format used to request advance leave.)
2.10. Restoration of Forfeited Annual Leave. An employee who is unable to take scheduled excess
annual leave must request that leave be restored or the leave will be forfeited. The employee’s request
must be in writing to the immediate supervisor and explain why the leave was not taken. The supervisor
must verify the request. After verification, the supervisor will endorse or disapprove the request. Forward
endorsed requests with a copy of the Leave Request, OPM-71, projected annual leave forecast (or any
appropriate supporting documentation showing leave was scheduled), and the number of hours to be
restored to the Labor and Employee Management Relations Section (436 MSS/DPCE) immediately fol-
lowing the end of the leave year.
3.5.2. When a member of an employee’s family has a contagious disease and he/she submits a request for
sick leave, the employee’s supervisor will verify the information in the employee’s request and forward
the request to 436 MSS/DPCE. Based on the documentation, the Civilian Personnel Officer determines if
the disease and situation require the employee to have sick leave to attend and care for the family member.
3.11. Use of Advance Sick Leave. The employee must submit a separate written request for each period
of advance sick leave to his/her immediate supervisor. The Civilian Personnel Officer is the final approv-
ing official for advance sick leave. Requests will contain the following: the amount of sick leave
requested, the type of disability or ailment, and the length of time employed at Dover AFB; a statement
that employee is aware that, should he/she separate before repaying this advance sick leave, monies owed
will be deducted from employee’s retirement contributions if no other unpaid compensation remains to
employee’s credit; a statement from the employee’s attending physician must be attached, indicating the
amount of time the employee is expected to be incapacitated and unable to perform the full range of
assigned duties. (See Attachment 6 (Added) of this instruction for suggested format)
3.11.1. If approval is recommended, the first-level supervisor will make a statement regarding the manner
in which accumulated sick leave has been used by the employee and whether or not he or she believes the
advance sick leave will serve to expedite the employee’s return to duty. This endorsement letter will also
include the employee’s sick leave balance as of the end of the pay period immediately preceding the
employee’s request. This information may be obtained from the Supervisor’s Leave Listing, the
employee’s Leave and Earning Statement, or from the Civilian Pay Liaison (FMFPC). (See Attachment
6 (Added) for sample format and information that must be provided to request advance sick leave.) Sub-
mit the request for advance sick leave to 436 MSS/DPCE. After final approval/disapproval by the Civilian
Personnel Officer, one copy of the approval letter will be forwarded to FMFPC and two copies will be for-
warded to the supervisor (one for the employee; the other retained with AF Form 971, Supervisor’s
Employee Brief).
4.4. Who Approves LWOP. Supervisors may approve up to 30 days Leave Without Pay (LWOP). A
request for LWOP of more than 30 days must be in writing and submitted to the employee’s immediate
supervisor for review and recommendation. (If the employee’s request is for leave without pay to perform
duty with the uniformed services (LWOP-US), follow the guidance in paragraph 4.5. below). The Civilian
Personnel Officer is the final approval authority for LWOP of more than 30 days. An employee’s request
will contain the reasons for requesting LWOP and amount requested. If due to illness, a physician’s state-
AFI36-815_DOVERAFBSUP1 19 AUGUST 2004                                                                  3


ment containing information as shown in AFI 36-815, paragraph 3.11., is required. The first-level super-
visor will review employee’s request to determine if approval is justified based on the requirements
contained in AFI 36-815, Chapter 4. If the requested LWOP is more than 30 days, the first-level supervi-
sor will endorse the employee’s request recommending approval/disapproval and forward the request to
436 MSS/DPCE. Requests for LWOP in excess of 30 days will be distributed in accordance with para-
graph 3.11.1.
4.5. Leave Without Pay-Uniformed Services (LWOP-US). A Request for Personnel Action (RPA) for
LWOP-US will be submitted to the Civilian Personnel Flight for the Civilian Personnel Officer’s
approval. The RPA must contain the employee’s mailing address, special order number and date, and the
length of the active duty tour. A copy of the special order will be provided to 436 MSS/DPCE, Building
520, Room 120.
7.6.4. (Added) An Emergency services employee who is unable to get to work because of weather condi-
tions may be granted annual leave or leave without pay the same as permitted when the base is open for
normal operations. Administrative leave laws do not apply to Emergency services employees.
8.3. Absence for Brief Periods or Tardiness. Brief periods of early dismissal of less than 1 hour (some-
times referred to as the “59 minute rule”) may only be granted with explicit approval of the Installation
Commander. This authority is not further delegated.
9.5. Approving Official’s Responsibilities. The Approving Official at Dover AFB is the Civilian Per-
sonnel Officer. The Office of Primary Responsibility at Dover AFB is the Labor and Employee Manage-
ment Relations Section (436 MSS/DPCE).
