donor does not expect anything of value in return other than recognition and does not have
control over expenditure. A gift may meet the interests of the donor and can be restricted or
unrestricted. A restricted gift is a contribution designated for a specific purpose, program or
project. If the donor does not specify any restrictions, the gift is unrestricted and the institution
allocates the funds at its own discretion.
Gift to the Department of the Air Force—A gift offered to the United States, or to the
Secretary of the Air Force acting on behalf of the United States.
Gift of Services—Performance of work or labor on behalf of the Air Force with no expectation
of payment.
Gift of Travel—Funds—The donor may pay the government in advance for all, part, or none of
the travel costs. If the donor does not pay for the entire cost of the travel up front, it asks the
government to pay the remaining costs before the travel occurs. When the member comes back
to settle the travel voucher, the donor refunds the government whatever remaining amount it
previously agreed to pay, up to the total government-paid cost of the travel.
Gift of Travel—In-Kind—The donor or vendor pays directly for one or more confirmed travel
related costs (examples: lodging, ticketed travel, meals). Traveler will not be reimbursed for in-
kind gifts of travel. If an in-kind gift does not fully provide for the travel, it may be
supplemented with a gift of funds, government funds, or some combination of these, up to the
total cost of the travel.
Grant—Is the transfer of money or property from a sponsor to an institution that may require
performance of specific duties such as research, budget reports, progress reports, and return of
unused funds (examples: sponsored program funding or awards).
