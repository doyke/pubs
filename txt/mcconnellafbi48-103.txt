MCCONNELLAFBI48-103 1 JUNE 2010                                                               3


        4.1.4.2. Tab D2: OSHA Specific Substance Training Requirements: Exposures to
        certain substances mandate specific training requirements according to OSHA (29
        CFR 1910, Subpart Z). The primary substances of concern for McConnell workplaces
        (although not all inclusive) are lead (29 CFR 1910.1025), cadmium (29 CFR
        1910.1027), benzene (29 CFR 1910.1028) and methylene chloride (29 CFR
        1910.1052). This tab will delineate how the workplace supervisor will accomplish
        this training and contain the copies of or will tell where the appropriate lessons plans
        are filed.
     4.1.5. Tab E: Non-Routine Tasks: All tasks identified as non-routine according to para
     4.4. will be listed or negative documentation supplied.
     4.1.6. Any information other than that specified in para 4.1. above will not be kept with
     the HAZCOM binder.
  4.2. Hazardous Chemicals Inventory:
     4.2.1. Through the use of the Hazardous Material Pharmacy system, shop supervisors
     should not store more than a 7 to 10 day supply of hazardous materials in the work
     center. Installation CE/LG may approve exceptions on a case-by-case basis. Attempts by
     workplaces to maintain “bench stock” supplies are highly discouraged and circumvent
     the intent of the pharmacy system.
        4.2.1.1. Prior to new chemicals being introduced in the workplace, AF Form 3952
        will be submitted through the pharmacy. After approval IAW AFI 32-7086,
        Hazardous Materials Management the chemical will be added to the chemical
        authorization listing in EMIS.
  4.3. MSDS:
     4.3.1. The BEF through the HAZMART Pharmacy will maintain the MSDS master file
     for all hazardous chemicals procured by Air Force agencies at MAFB.
        4.3.1.1. MSDSs will be readily available to all workers with potential occupational
        exposures. Information will be accessed through the BEF, HAZMART Pharmacy or
        manufacturer, at mutually acceptable prearranged times. However, manufacturer
        proprietary information will not be disclosed to the workers.
        4.3.1.2. The shop supervisor will provide MSDSs on newly identified chemicals
        when requesting authorization to add to hazardous materials inventories. If MSDSs
        are unavailable locally, supervisors should contact manufacturer for that item.
        4.3.1.3. MSDSs will be procured for each manufacturer specific HAZMAT as
        different manufacturers under the same NSN and/or chemical name do not
        necessarily contain the same formulation and ingredients.
        4.3.1.4. For hazardous materials produced by Air Force components, the activity
        controlling the formulation will develop the MSDS. An MSDS will be provided to
        subsequent users and made available to affected employees.
     4.3.2. Supervisors will notify the BEF by utilizing the AF Form 3952 chemical
     authorization process each time a new potentially hazardous chemical or substance is
     introduced into the work area.

    4.4. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials:
       4.4.1. The workplace supervisor will be responsible for developing a listing of all tasks
       performed by the shop on a non-routine (less than 2 times per year) basis. This listing
       will include hazard information associated with performing non-routine tasks as well as
       protective measures required during such tasks.
       4.4.2. BEF will review all non-routine task listings upon request by the workplace
       supervisor and during health risk assessment surveys.
       4.4.3. The workplace supervisor will include this non-routine task listing as an
       attachment to the workplace written HAZCOM program.
       4.4.4. The workplace will provide negative documentation as an attachment to the
       written workplace HAZCOM program in workplaces that do not perform non-routine
       tasks.
    4.5. Contractor Operations:
       4.5.1. At locations where Air Force employees may be exposed to chemicals used by
       contractors, the contractor(s) will report the chemical usage to the HAZMART and
       provide the MSDS for these chemicals to any affected workplace supervisor for inclusion
       into their MSDS file for worker review.
           4.5.1.1. The Contract Administrator will also inform the contractor about the MSDS
           information available through the BEF or the HAZMART Pharmacy as requested, for
           inclusion in the contractor HAZCOM program.
           4.5.1.2. The activity quality assurance evaluator will advise the work area
           supervisors and Air Force employees monitoring the performance of contractors of
           hazardous chemicals introduced by the contractor. This will be accomplished during
           the pre-performance conference and subsequently during the contract performance
           period.
           4.5.1.3. The Contract Administrator will ensure that the Federal Acquisition
           Regulation (FAR), clause 52.223-3, Hazardous Material Identification and Material
           Safety Data, is included in all local procurement contracts for potentially hazardous
           materials. Contractors will provide MSDSS to the BEF for any new hazardous
           materials they may need to introduce onto the base.
    4.6. Employee Information and Training:
       4.6.1. Public Health Flight (PHF) is the point of contact for assistance in occupational
       health education, and provides consultation on training and technical matters to work
       area/shop supervisors on the AF HAZCOM Program.
           4.6.1.1. PHF will work with workplace supervisors to develop workplace specific
           training programs and lesson plans for use in training workers.
           4.6.1.2. BEF will provide specific information to workplace supervisors during
           routine or special health risk assessment surveys that will include a listing of all
           hazards associated with work in the workplace and measures to protect the workers
           from those hazards.
MCCONNELLAFBI48-103 1 JUNE 2010                                                               5


       4.6.2. Workplace supervisors will work with PHF to develop workplace specific training
       programs and lesson plans. The information provided by BEF will be incorporated into
       the training program.

           HAZCOM training for all workers upon initial assignment in the workplace and when
           new chemicals are introduced into the workplace thereafter.
       4.6.3. Documentation of Training. This training will be documented on AF Form 55, or
       in a computerized information management system designed to maintain training records.
       Optional Form 21 may be used to denote location of employee training documentation.
       4.6.4. Disposition of Training Records. AF Form 55 will be carried to their new base or
       kept by the supervisor for one year after separating or retiring.
   4.7. Labeling of Hazardous Materials Containers: All containers of hazardous materials must
   be properly labeled IAW AFI 90-821.
5. After-Hours Procedures. If the 22d Medical Group, Acute Medical Control Center (DSN
743-5020 / Commercial 316-759-5020) receives requests for review of MSDSs after normal duty
hours, they will notify the BEF on the next duty day, if not of an urgent nature. The BEF
technician on-call will be contacted anytime for response to requests involving imminent adverse
health effects.
