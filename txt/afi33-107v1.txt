This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 33-1, Command, Control, Communica-
tions, and Computer (C4) Systems. It prescribes the requirements, responsibilities, and procedures for
operation, security, and configuration management of the Strategic Automated Command Control Sys-
tem-Data Transmission Subsystem (SACCS-DTS). It applies to all users of the SACCS-DTS Network,
either through direct input or interface systems. When major commands (MAJCOMs) and field operating
agencies (FOAs) supplement this instruction, they should provide a copy to Headquarters Air Force Space
Command (HQ AFSPC)/SCMB, 150 Vandenberg Street, Ste 1105, Peterson AFB CO 80914-4730, with
a copy to Headquarters Air Force Communications Agency (HQ AFCA)/XPXP, 203 W. Losey Street,
Room 1065, Scott AFB IL 62225-5224. Refer recommended changes and conflicts between this and

cation, with an information copy to HQ AFCA/XPXP. See Attachment 1 for a glossary of references,
abbreviations, an acronyms.



1. Terminology and References.
   1.1. Applicability. This instruction applies to all users who either interface with or support the Stra-
   tegic Automated Command Control System, Data Transmission Subsystem (SACCS-DTS) Network.
   The SACCS-DTS Network provides commanders with information required for decisions affecting
   the control and direction of strategic forces. In addition, it provides subscribers with direct interface
   to the Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN), Air Force Global Weather Center (AFGWC), Com-
   mand Center Processing and Display System (CCPDS), and at Peacekeeper Intercontinental Ballistic
   Missile sites with Air Force Satellite Communications System (AFSATCOM), and Survivable Low
   Frequency Communications System (SLFCS). SACCS is two major electronically interconnected
   subsystems; the DTS and the Data Processing Subsystem (DPS).
   1.2. Authority And Organization. HQ AFSPC, as the lead command of the SACCS-DTS Network, is
   responsible for the operations, hardware maintenance, and software maintenance. They also provide
   operational guidance and hardware support. As the system program manager for acquisition , HQ Air
   Force Materiel Command (SM-ALC/LHO), provides service support according to DoD-STD-5000,
   Defense Acquisition; and Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5000.1, Defense Acquisition,
   March 15, 1996. The 55th Computer Systems Squadron (55 CSS), 55th Wing, Air Combat Command
   (ACC), Offutt AFB NE, provides operational and software support through the Computer Program
   Maintenance Facility (CPMF) and SACCS Operations Facility. Configuration management and soft-
   ware change control are the responsibility of the commander, 55 CSS, and the network software func-
   tional manager (NSFM).
   1.3. Terminology.
      1.3.1. Change Classification. A method of grouping system changes according to their nature,
      magnitude, and effect. Each group requires slightly different processing and reviewing proce-
      dures. Changes to system software, hardware, procedures, or documentation fall into one of two
      categories:
          1.3.1.1. Class I Change. A major modification or new capability to software programs. The
          Design Control Board (DCB) reviews all requirements and discrepancies designated as Class
          I changes, whether software, hardware, or procedural. Submit Class I changes on a Baseline
          Change Request (BCR) form.
          1.3.1.2. Class II Change. A deficiency, discrepancy, or problem that typically requires a
          minor correction to documentation or software to comply with existing requirements. Submit
          Class II changes on a Software Problem Report (SPR) form or on AF Form 1067, Modifica-
          tion Proposal. The Requirements Analysis Team (RAT) monitors and approves Class II
          changes.
   1.4. References. See Attachment 1.
   1.5. Document Responsibility. The commander, 55th Computer Systems Squadron, is the office of
   collateral responsibility for this instruction. Address questions to:
   55 CSS/CMTQ

2. Software Problem Reporting.
   2.1. Software Review Bodies. The following bodies handle the review, approval, and management of
   software change requests.
      2.1.1. Design Control Board (DCB). This board includes highly qualified members from software
      development, plans and management, and user communities.
          2.1.1.1. Reviews and approves all proposed Class I change requests.
          2.1.1.2. Advises the designated approval authority (DAA) on the review and actions taken for

                                              2
      all Class I changes.
      2.1.1.3. Forwards all approved changes to the Requirement Analysis Team (RAT) for action.
   2.1.2. RAT. This team is the management and review body at the CPMF level.
      2.1.2.1. Reviews Class II change requests for approval, and accepts Class I change requests
      from the DCB.
      2.1.2.2. Plans the specific programming actions for the change and monitors its progress
      through the software development cycle.
2.2. Requesting Changes. Any SACCS-DTS user can submit change requests. Submit the change
request to 55 CSS/CMT by letter or message through the SACCS-DTS Network Quality Control Cen-
ter (NQCC). You can also use AF Form 1067. Report operational discrepancies (computer aborts,
hardware and or software problems) directly to the NQCC.
2.3. Normal Problem/Trouble Reporting. The NQCC provides near real-time status of the entire
SACCS-DTS Network. The NQCC maintains records of all outages, downtimes, discrepancies, and
corrective actions through the SACCS Trouble Monitor Report (STMR).
   2.3.1. SACCS-DTS software provides automatic reporting of Initial Program Loads (IPLs),
   restarts, line outages, and equipment failures to the NQCC. Node operators provide any additional
   information requested by NQCC.
   2.3.2. Facts pertaining to specific problems (user isolations, equipment failures, line outages, etc.)
   are not classified, unless analysis determines a threat to the entire network. The Network Security
   Manager makes the classification determination, using the SACCS-DTS Classification Guide.
   2.3.3. To report a problem in system performance, users must notify NQCC by message to
   SACCS-DTS address SACNC. Use any format, but include the following information:
      2.3.3.1. SACCS-DTS address of processor or Collocated User Terminal Element (CUTE)
      where problem occurred.
      2.3.3.2. Date/Zulu Time Group of problem.
      2.3.3.3. Name and duty phone of person(s) to contact regarding the problem.
      2.3.3.4. Software version in use (available on Initial Program Load (IPL) diskette label).
      2.3.3.5. A free text description of actions leading to the problem, how the system failed, and
      corrective measures taken.
      2.3.3.6. The dump diskette label identification (ID) number, as applicable.
   2.3.4. For unusual occurrences (those not normally reported as discrepancies or disruptions), gen-
   erate a letter or message immediately to the NQCC. The report should include:
      2.3.4.1. Circumstances of the occurrence, including down and up times.
      2.3.4.2. The site, terminal, or functional area (FA) where the problem occurred.
      2.3.4.3. Applicable hardware registers, and any dump(s) taken.
      2.3.4.4. Any other pertinent information.



                                             3
   2.4. Documentation. All computer systems and programs require written documentation, with sup-
   porting references, to function successfully. Documentation must satisfy the needs of programmers,
   analysts, operators, and management personnel. The four categories are:
      2.4.1. Application documentation. Provides programmers, testers, and configuration manage-
      ment personnel the ability to ensure the integrity and operability of all code segments. Application
      documentation includes:
          2.4.1.1. System documentation describes the interrelationship of the system and its various
          programs and subprograms. System documentation also describes the interrelationship of the
          system and program with any related resources and references.
          2.4.1.2. Program documentation describes the logic of the program flow in narrative form, to
          aid the programmer in understanding what the program is accomplishing.
          2.4.1.3. Computer source code printouts describe the program operation, including comments
          to support program maintenance, debugging, and modification.
      2.4.2. Operator documentation. Operators and other system users require documentation that
      provides instructions for man-machine interaction. User’s guide, or system notification message
      listings are examples of operator documentation.
      2.4.3. Maintenance documentation. Maintenance personnel require documentation to maintain
      the system and diagnose fault areas. This includes hardware and software diagnostics, abort lists,
      error codes, unique procedures and software associated with special tests.
      2.4.4. Management documentation. Management personnel require a general, but well-defined
      narrative of major programs, sub-programs, and sub-routines as they function in the system. This
      provides command-level management the knowledge necessary to make decisions on system
      operations and software changes.
   2.5. Program Testing. The objective of program testing is to increase confidence that the software
   functions as intended in the operational environment and that it meets all specified requirements.
      2.5.1. Test and document all software changes before configuring and authorizing release as oper-
      ational software.
      2.5.2. Test system software in an environment that represents its normal operational configura-
      tion to the fullest extent possible.
      2.5.3. Document software and testing results at the appropriate level.

3. Configuration Management.
   3.1. General. This paragraph establishes procedures for configuring and controlling SACCS-DTS
   software. All SACCS functions must:
      3.1.1. Design, test, document, coordinate, and disseminate all software changes in an orderly and
      controlled manner. Incorporate only approved and configured software changes into current oper-
      ational, utility, support and maintenance software.
      3.1.2. Assign a unique control number for all software products and changes. Use the project
      control number to identify each line of code added or modified as a part of the project. SACCS


                                               4
   Configuration Management maintains the control numbers and establishes the baseline for dis-
   kette content.
3.2. SACCS Configuration Management (55 CSS/CMTQ):
   3.2.1. Maintains a master program library of the current and last two superseded source code list-
   ings on tape for each computer program release.
   3.2.2. Maintains each baseline listing (major release) until no longer needed.
   3.2.3. For on-line operational programs, retains a printed text listing of the master copy of the cur-
   rent operational software.
   3.2.4. Promotes and configures all completed projects for release and develop a release plan.
   Develops golden master diskettes for the operational librarian (55 CSS/CMOL) to use in release
   production.
   3.2.5. Does not implement any changes that impact missile operations until technical orders and
   operational manuals reflect the change.
3.3. Release Implementation. Controls release and distribution of software upgrades to prevent the
possibility of unauthorized modification (see Attachment 4). There are three types of software
release implementations.
   3.3.1. Major Release. A major release generally applies to a release affecting all sites in the
   SACCS-DTS Network. Identify major releases by the first letter of the Version ID and seven
   zeros (e.g., A0000000). Implementation may be incremental or simultaneous. For an incremental
   implementation, the existing software must work with the new software. Distribute a Software
   Version Description (SVD) detailing the changes made in the new release in conjunction with the
   software.
   3.3.2. Interim Release. Occasionally, it is necessary to correct software deficiencies or imple-
   ment operational requirements on an interim basis before the next scheduled major release.
   Interim releases are identified by alphabetic characters in the fifth and sixth positions of the Ver-
   sion ID (e.g., A000aa00). After building the interim software for affected nodes in the network,
   implement by one of these methods:
       3.3.2.1. Electronic Program Update (EPU) (see Attachment 1). Update software at affected
       nodes. This will eliminate the need to generate and distribute IPL diskettes and a SVD. Do
       not employ EPU for any changes involving Trusted Computing Base (TCB).
       3.3.2.2. Normal Release Distribution. Prepare and distribute IPL diskettes in the same man-
       ner as a major release, including a SVD.
   3.3.3. Emergency Release. When the nature of a software or operational issue requires an imme-
   diate change, prepare an emergency release. Identify emergency releases by entering numbers in
   the last two character positions of the Version ID (e.g., A00000nn). Limit emergency releases to
   single changes when possible. Since it bypasses normal software configuration procedures, use
   emergency releases with caution. Incorporate all emergency release changes in the next interim or
   major release (if still in effect). Implement emergency releases in the same manner as a major
   release. Substitute a Release Implementation Plan (RIP) for the SVD.



                                             5
3.4. Diskette Handling. Maintain software and operational information for the SACCS-DTS on
eight-inch diskettes. Verify the integrity of the shipment by inspection of the SACCS-DTS blue logo
tape (see Attachment 5 for inspection procedures). Label each software diskette with the applicable
configuration control designation and identifying data (i.e., release version, site, and date created).
   3.4.1. Handling. Protect the diskettes from extreme temperatures, magnetic forces, bending, and
   contaminants. Do not touch exposed surfaces on the diskette. When storing diskettes, keep the
   diskette in the protective jacket when not in the disk drive. Failure to follow these instructions
   could lead to damaged media.
   3.4.2. Diskette Classification. Once placed in the processor, classify and control ALL diskettes at
   the security level of the processor. Regardless of classification, account for all diskettes. Units
   will implement local procedures to account for UNCLASSIFIED and SECRET diskettes.
   Account for TOP SECRET diskettes according to DoD Regulation 5200.1, DoD Information
   Security Program Regulation, June 1986, with Changes 1 and 2, and AFI 31-401, Managing the
   Information Security Program.
       3.4.2.1. IPL Diskettes: IPL diskettes are UNCLASSIFIED when shipped from 55 CSS/
       CMOL (SACCS Library). Retain IPL diskettes as directed by the current Version Description
       Document, paragraph 2.6. Package and store superseded release versions at a separate loca-
       tion to prevent inadvertent use. Destroy all other IPL diskettes according to paragraph 3.4.7.
       3.4.2.2. System Diskettes (Menu, Journal, Dump, Empty): System diskettes are UNCLASSI-
       FIED when shipped from 55 CSS/CMOL (SACCS Library). Retain diskettes for reuse within
       the same processor until the diskette is unusable. Once unusable, destroy the diskette accord-
       ing to paragraph 3.4.7.
       3.4.2.3. Diagnostics Diskettes. Diagnostic diskettes are formatted with specific files. System
       configuration and file structure prevent them from containing any information higher than
       UNCLASSIFIED/For Official Use Only (FOUO). Employ and store diagnostic diskettes
       according to operations requirements and local procedures. Unusable or obsolete diskettes
       should be destroyed according to paragraph 3.4.7.
   3.4.3. The SACCS Operational Librarian (55 CSS/CMOL):
       3.4.3.1. Maintains an emergency back-up set of master diskettes for the current and the latest
       superseded software versions. Stores back-up masters off-site for back-up integrity.
       3.4.3.2. Produces release software diskettes. Distributes release diskettes with the SVD or
       RIP. Distributes new software versions only to those sites requiring the changes.
       3.4.3.3. Uses US Postal Service, Registered mail or United Parcel Service (UPS) to distribute
       outgoing IPL diskettes. Seals the inner wrapping with logo tape imprinted with the SACCS-
       DTS logo.
       3.4.3.4. Does not use software master diskettes for any purpose other than for reference and
       emergency reproduction.
   3.4.4. Diskette Retention.
       3.4.4.1. Dump Diskettes. Retain used dump diskettes for a minimum of 10 days. If not
       required for dump analysis, reuse dump diskettes as necessary.


                                             6
          3.4.4.2. Journal Diskettes. Base Communications Processors (BCPs) retain journal diskettes
          for 10 days. SCPs retain journal diskettes for 30 days. If not required for system analysis or
          message tracking, reuse journal diskettes as necessary.
      3.4.5. Diskette Analysis. If there is a need to analyze a dump diskette or journal diskette, NQCC
      will arrange remote dump action and or shipment of the diskette. Missile crews will not process
      remote dump actions from the Launch Control Centers (LCCs), but return dump diskettes to the
      issuing agency for remote dump processing. When shipping diskettes, comply with the require-
      ments of DoD Regulation 5200.1 and AFI 31-401 for handling classified media.
      3.4.6. Diskette Labeling. Reference AFI 33-107, Volume 2, Strategic Automated Command Con-
      trol System-Data Transmission Subsystem (SACCS-DTS) Network Security Program (Attach-
      ment 2) for specific labeling instructions. The 55 CSS/CMO labels diskettes with identifying
      serial numbers and a diskette name. Do not remove this label. Label each diskette with markings
      or warning notices (i.e., Restricted Data, Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), etc.) accord-
      ingly. Do not remove United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) Form 148, SIOP
      Label, once placed on the diskette.
      3.4.7. Diskette Destruction.
          3.4.7.1. Destroy classified media according to Air Force System Security Instruction (AFSSI)
          5020, Remanence Security. NOTE: Destroy the diskettes locally. Do NOT return media to
          SACCS Library for destruction.
          3.4.7.2. Document destruction of diskettes according to DoD Regulation 5200.1 and AFI 31-
          401. Forward one information copy of destruction records to the 55 CSS/CMOL (SACCS
          Library) for accountability purposes.
