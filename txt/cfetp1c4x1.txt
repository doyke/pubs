                                                 5
Section A - General Information

1. Purpose. This CFETP provides the information necessary for the Air Force Career Field
Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers,
supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage and conduct an effective and efficient career
field training program. The plan outlines the training that individuals in AFSC 1C4X1 must
receive in order to develop and progress throughout their careers. For the purpose of this plan,
training is divided into four areas: initial skills, upgrade training (UGT), qualification training (QT)
and continuation training (CT). Initial skills training is the Air Force Specialty (AFS) specific
training an individual receives upon entering into the AFSC. This training is provided by Det 3,
342 Training Squadron (TRS) at Hurlburt Field, FL. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory
courses, task qualification requirements, and Career Development Course (CDC) completion
required for award of the 5-, 7-, and 9-skill level. Qualification training is hands-on task
performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position. This training
program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the
performance skills/knowledge training required to do the job. Continuation training is additional
training provided to 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-level personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond
the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes, some of which are:

1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, develop, manage, and conduct a career field training
program. Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an
individual’s career.

1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in this specialty and
recommends training throughout each phase of an individual's career.

1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training
delivery method.

1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact implementation of the desired career field
training program.

2. Use. MFMs and supervisors at all levels use the plan to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive
training program is available for each individual in the specialty.

2.1. AETC training personnel develop and revise formal resident, non-resident and exportable
training based on requirements established by the user and documented in Part II of the CFETP.
They also work with the AFCFM to develop procurement and acquisition strategies for obtaining
resources needed to provide the identified training.

2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial and
upgrade skills requirements. Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training,
contract training, or exportable courses. MAJCOM and NGB developed training to support this
AFSC must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate available training
resources.
2.3. The list of courses in Part II is used as a reference to support training.

                                                   6
2.4. Submit recommended CFETP improvements/corrections to the AFSC Training Manager at
342 TRS/DORM, 950 Voyager Dr, Lackland AFB, TX 78236-5724.

3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to
ensure currency and accuracy. MFMs and AETC training managers will identify and coordinate
on the career field training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate
duplicate training. The AFCFM is the approval authority. MAJCOM and NGB representatives
and AETC training personnel coordinate on the career field training requirements. The AFCFM
is the authority for waiving any mandatory training requirement(s). Process waiver requests to
the AFCFM as described in AFI 36-2201 V5, Air Force Training Program Career Field
Education and Training.

superintendent skill level play an extremely important role in the Air Force’s ability to accomplish
its mission. Therefore, it is essential that everyone involved in training do their part to plan,
develop, manage, conduct, and evaluate an effective and efficient training program. The guidance
provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure individuals receive viable training at the appropriate
points in their career. The following narrative and the AFSC 1C4X1 career field flow charts
identify the training career path. They define the training required in an individual’s career.

5.1. Apprentice (3) Level. Meeting mandatory requirements listed in the Air Force Enlisted
Classification Directory (AFECD) specialty description, completion of the TACP Apprentice
Course, L3ABP1C431 0T0( ), at Hurlburt Field, FL is mandatory. The decision to train specific
task and knowledge items in the initial skills course is based on a review of the Occupational
Survey Report (OSR) data, Training Requirements Analysis (TRA) data and 1C431 Subject Matter
Expert (SME) input. Task and knowledge training requirements are identified in Part II, Section
A. Individuals must complete the initial skills course to be awarded AFSC 1C431.

5.2. Journeyman (5) Level. Upgrade training to the 5-skill level in this specialty consists of tasks
and knowledge training provided in Career Development Course (CDC) 1C451. Individuals must
meet mandatory requirements listed in the AFECD specialty description, be certified on all core
tasks indicated on the STS, complete unit specific duty position tasks, complete Survive, Evade,

6. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to
encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Tactical Air Control Party career
field. This CFETP was developed to include life-cycle (day one through retirement) training
requirements for this specialty. The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to
meet the training requirements. The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication
of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.
6.1. Initial Skills Training. The initial skills course was revised to provide training needed to
prepare graduates for TACP duty positions. A continuing requirement exists for all individuals to

                                                  8
receive combat survival training (Course S-V80-A, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape
(SERE) Training) or Air Force Career Field Manager approved equivalent. A minimum of six
graduates per class require attendance at airborne training (Course L5AZA1T231-001, Airborne
Parachutist, at Ft Benning, GA) to ensure the career fields ability to sustain it’s Designed
Operational Capability (DOC) statement requirements to support U.S. Army airborne operations.

Section C - Skill Level Training Requirements

9. Purpose. Skill level training requirements in this career field are defined in terms of tasks and
knowledge requirements. This section outlines the specialty qualification requirements for each
skill level in broad, general terms and establishes the mandatory requirements for entry, award, and
retention of each skill level. The specific task and knowledge training requirements are identified
in the STS at Part II, Sections A and B of this CFETP.

10. Specialty Qualifications:

10.1. Apprentice Level Training: NOTE: Apprentice Physical Training. Superior physical
conditioning is a cornerstone of combat effectiveness. TACP apprentice training emphasizes
physical training to assure that course graduates have the temperament and potential to meet the
intense physical challenges inherent in the TACP specialty. Efficient training of TACP
Apprentices (3-skill level) is a complex effort. The demanding physical nature of the TACP career
field coupled with the requirement to conduct high risk training/operations requires persistent
attention to detail in training. This attention to detail can be learned and reinforced through
Motivational Training (MT) applied during the TACP Apprentice Course. MT will be IAW
AETCI 36-2203, para 3.5.2.10, Technical and Basic Military Training Development, and
implemented into the course via an Annex to the Course Training Plans. MT must be tied to and

PART II

Section A - Specialty Training Standard

1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes
beginning 15 Jan 10 for 3-skill level training. Course implementation for 7-skill level training will
be with classes beginning 4 Jan 10. The CDC was activated 20041001 and will start the revision
process when this CFETP is published.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201 Volume 5, this STS:

2.1. Lists in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks,
knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for Airman to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and
7-skill level. Items in column 1 marked with an asterisk (*) are the tasks/knowledge trained in
resident wartime courses. Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies, by skill level, minimum task training
requirements for upgrade to a particular skill level.

2.2. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and
knowledge training requirements. Task certification must show documentation entries IAW AFI
36-2201 Volume 3, On the Job Training Administration.

2.3. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the
proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the
task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course. For current
CDC listings, see the AFIADL Catalog maintained at
http://www.au.af.mil/au/afiadl/curriculum/catalog/html/catalogtoc.htm.

2.4. Qualitative Requirements. The proficiency code key is used to indicate the level of training
and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.

2.5. Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for OJT when placed in AF Form 623, OJT
Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201, Volume 3, On The Job Training Administration.

2.6. Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion
System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKT) are developed at the USAF Occupational
Measurement Squadron by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.
The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team
members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study
references listed in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS) catalog. Individual
responsibilities are listed in chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing
System. WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces.

2.7. Documentation. Document and certify completion of training. Identify duty position
requirements by circling the subparagraph number or letter next to the task statement. Task are
trained and qualified to the “Go” level. “Go” means the individual can perform the task without
assistance and meet local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures (“Go”



                                                 21
level equates to 3c in the STS proficiency code key). Review AFI 36-2201 Volume 3 for the latest
guidance.

2.7.1. Transcribing. Transcribing documentation to a new CFETP is an administrative function,
not a re-evaluation of training. Therefore, supervisor and trainer are considered synonymous for
the purpose of documentation. Transcribe within 120 days (240 days for ARC) of published date
of revised CFETP. Upon publication of a new CFETP, use the following procedures to transcribe:

2.7.1.1. Use the new CFETP to identify past and current training requirements and to transcribe
qualifications from the previous CFETP.

2.7.1.2. For tasks previously certified and required in the current duty position, circle the
subparagraph number next to the task statement and enter the current date in the completion
column. Trainee initials in the trainee column and the current task certifier or supervisor/trainer
initials in the trainer column.

2.7.1.3. For tasks previously certified but not required in the current duty position (do not circle),
transcribe only the previous certification date (no initials). If the task later becomes required in the
duty position, recertify using current dates and initials.

2.7.1.4. Annotate the AF Form 623a, (for example, “I certify the information contained in the
CFETP dated XX was transcribed to the CFETP dated XX, and the trainee was given the
superseded CFETP.” Signed and dated by supervisor and trainee).

2.7.2. Decertification and Recertification. When a supervisor determines an Airman is unqualified
on a task previously certified for their duty position, the supervisor erases the previous
certification, or deletes certification when using automated system. Appropriate remarks
pertaining to the reason for the decertification are entered on the AF Form 623a. Begin
recertification (if required) following procedures in AFI 36-2201 Volume 3.

2.7.3. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available, the supervisor identifies
knowledge items in the CFETP, Part II, CDC column. Using Technical references required for
career knowledge training, the supervisor briefs Airmen on their use. Airman completes study of
references, is evaluated by the supervisor, and is certified in the CFETP. For two-time CDC
course exam failures, supervisors identify all STS items corresponding to the areas covered by the
CDC. The trainee completes a study of STS references, undergoes evaluation by the task certifier,
and receives certification on the STS. NOTE: Career knowledge must be documented prior to
submitting a CDC waiver.

3. Recommendations. Comments and recommendations are invited concerning the quality of
AETC training. Reference this CFETP and address correspondence regarding changes to 37
TRG/DOS, 1220 Truemper Street, Lackland AFB, TX 78236. A Customer Service Information
Line (CSIL) has been installed for the supervisor’s convenience to identify graduates who may
have received over or under training on task/knowledge items listed in this training standard. For

4. Surveys

4.1. Graduate Assessment Surveys. The Graduate Assessment Survey (GAS) is part of the AETC
Training Evaluation program. Training evaluation provides the basis for determining the quality of
training as specified in AETCI 36-2201, Training Evaluation. The GAS survey is comprised of a
few simple questions directed at the immediate supervisor of recent graduates from Technical
Training. The supervisor is considered the best qualified to evaluate the graduate who recently
arrived from technical training. When answering the questions, the graduate is assessed as he was
upon arrival at his first duty station. The survey questions lean heavily on the first column in the
Specialty Training Standard (STS). The first column contains tasks that serve as the contract
between the Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) career field and AETC for initial training. For more
information concerning the GAS refer to AETCI 36-2201 or download the handbook at
https://www-r.aetc.af.mil/ttms/eval_quick_reference.htm

4.2. Field Evaluation Questionnaire (FEQ). FEQs are designed to solicit feedback from
supervisors and/or graduates to determine if graduates were trained as specified in the training
standard. FEQ Summaries (FEQS) summarize questionnaire results. Supervisors are the preferred
source for evaluating recent graduates of initial skill courses. Survey graduates when a supervisory
survey would not provide adequate feedback. When both graduate and supervisor data are
gathered, present the data for each separately. In supervisor questionnaires, ask for an overall rating
of graduates' job performance. In graduate questionnaires, ask for a rating of overall training
provided. For more information concerning the FEQ and FEQS, refer to AETCI 36-2201.
