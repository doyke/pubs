SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is the first publication of AFI 36-704, substantially revising AFR 40-750, 23 July 1982.
This issuance aligns the instruction with AFPD 36-7.

(MACDILL) This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
Major changes include clarification of the process for coordination and issue of disciplinary
action letters. Note that all adverse actions that are appealable to the Merit Systems Protection

      for preparation in final form. See paragraph 6.1.3. for additional information regarding
      final coordination of proposed and final notices.

        6.1.2. (Added-MACDILL) . Notices of Final Decision: Written employee replies to
        proposed notices and/or memos of oral replies prepared by the appropriate official to
        refute the charges will accompany draft notices of final decision.
        6.1.3. (Added-MACDILL) . When notices of proposed and final decision actions have
        been prepared in final form, and prior to the signature of the appropriate issuing official,
        they must be reviewed and coordinated on by the Civilian Personnel Officer. The
        supervisor responsible for issuing the disciplinary letter to the employee will ensure that a
        copy of the letter reflecting date of delivery, etc., is forwarded to the Employee Relations
        Specialist the same day the letter is delivered. The following information will be entered
        on the coordination sheet and included in the file:
"I have reviewed the notice of (proposed) (final decision to) (specify type of action) and agree
that it is appropriate on merit and procedurally correct." This statement will be signed and dated
by the Civilian Personnel Officer.

     6.2. The office of the staff judge advocate reviews notices of proposed adverse actions and
     notices of final decisions for legal sufficiency.
     6.2. (MACDILL) All disciplinary and adverse actions will be reviewed by the office of the
     Staff Judge Advocate prior to final coordination by the Civilian Personnel Office. All
     adverse actions that are appealable to the MSPB must also be coordinated through the
     LLFSC. The installation Staff Judge Advocate, in coordination with the Civilian Personnel
     Office, will submit proposed actions and decision documents in cases appealable to the
     MSPB to the LLFSC for coordination prior to issuance of the proposal or decision document.

Section B—Administering Constructive Disciplinary and Adverse Actions

7. General Information. This section gives general guidance to supervisors and managers for
the constructive administering of disciplinary and adverse actions. It doesn't establish mandatory
procedures.
     7.1. Constructive Discipline. Maintaining discipline usually is not a problem within a work
     environment where supervisors:
            Establish, clearly communicate, and consistently enforce reasonable rules and
            standards of conduct and performance.
            Set a good example.
            Identify conduct and performance that needs improvement in a way that respects the
            employee's dignity.
            Treat employees fairly and encourage them to improve.
            Recognize good performers.
AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010                                                               9


   7.2. Principles of Constructive Discipline. Constructive discipline is preventive in nature.
   The objectives are to:
           Develop, correct and rehabilitate employees.
           Encourage employees to accept responsibility.
           Prevent situations where no alternative to taking discipline exists.
   7.3. Carrying Out Constructive Discipline. When considering and taking disciplinary
   action, supervisors:
       7.3.1. Investigate the alleged offense and consider all available relevant information.
       7.3.2. Ensure that any action taken is fair, timely, and for good cause and that it complies
       with applicable law, regulation and policy.
       7.3.3. Ensure that disciplinary action contributes to the objective of constructive
       discipline in paragraph 7.2
       7.3.4. Conduct interviews and inquiries and discipline employees in private to minimize
       embarrassment.
       7.3.5. Involve the minimum number of people necessary when gathering facts and
       coordinating actions.
       7.3.6. Don't make information about disciplinary and adverse actions available to those
       outside of management circles or those that aren't affected by the action without the
       employee's consent.
       7.3.7. Observe the employee's right to representation. See paragraph 27. for guidance
       concerning the employee's right to representation including, where applicable, the
       employee's right to union representation.
       7.3.8. May not ask the employee to resign or retire to avoid discipline (see paragraph 9.).
8. Distinguishing Disciplinary From Nondisciplinary Situations. Improper identification of
whether a cause of action is a disciplinary or nondisciplinary situation may lead to a failure to
meet all requirements.
   8.1. A cause of action due to delinquency or misconduct personally attributable to the
   employee is a disciplinary situation. Examples include on or off-duty misconduct, absence
   without approved leave, violation of leave procedures, etc.
   8.2. A cause of action not due to an employee's delinquency or misconduct, but which is
   personal to the employee, is a nondisciplinary situation. Examples include inefficiency,
   physical or mental inability to perform the duties of the position, or lack of work or funds
   necessitating a furlough, etc.
9. Voluntary Separation and Reductions.
   9.1. Determine whether a separation or reduction in grade or pay is voluntary or involuntary
   based on each set of circumstances.
       9.1.1. Under most circumstances, voluntary actions include those that employees:
              Are free to choose.
 10                                                 AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010


              Clearly understand.
              Are permitted a reasonable time period in which to choose a course of action.
              Are permitted to set the effective date.
           9.1.1.1. Supervisors may suggest another effective date for a voluntary action, but
           may not arbitrarily set an earlier or later date.
       9.1.2. An employee confronted by supervisors with a potential disciplinary or adverse
       action may choose to voluntarily:
              Accept a reduction in grade or pay.
              Resign.
              Retire.
           9.1.2.1. Supervisors may discuss these alternatives with employees but may not
           advise or ask employees to resign or retire.

Section C—Disciplinary and Adverse Actions and Their Requirements

10. Governing Requirements. Supervisors and managers must respect employees' rights
established by law, regulation, policy, or collective bargaining agreements. Take disciplinary
and adverse actions by:
       Notifying employees of the proposed action.
       Giving employees an opportunity to respond to proposed actions.
       Notifying employees of the final decision.
       Informing employees of their access to appellate or grievance procedures.
Supervisors must accomplish disciplinary and adverse actions through written documents that
meet specified criteria. EXCEPTIONS: Supervisors need not document oral admonishments
discussed in paragraph 11. or, where applicable, oral notices of proposed reprimands discussed in
paragraph 12.4.4.
   10.1. Standard for Taking Disciplinary and Adverse Actions: Managers and supervisors:
       10.1.1. May take a disciplinary or adverse action only for such cause as will promote the
       efficiency of the service.
       10.1.2. May not take a disciplinary or adverse action against an employee on the basis of
       any of the reasons prohibited by 5 U.S.C. 2302.
   10.2. Burden of Proof:
       10.2.1. In order to meet the standard for taking an action, managers and supervisors
       must:
              Clearly specify the charges or reasons upon which the action is based.
              Be able to prove the specific charges or reasons which form the basis for the
              action by a preponderance of the evidence.
AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010                                                               11


             Be able to show the connection or “nexus” between the charges and the impact on
             the efficiency of the Air Force.
             Be able to show that the penalty imposed was appropriate under the circumstances
             (see paragraph 32.).
      10.2.2. Harmful Error. If harmful error is alleged in an appeal or grievance, the burden
      is upon the appellant or grievant to show that -- based upon the record as a whole -- the
      error was harmful (i.e., the outcome would probably have been different absent the error).
   10.3. Applying Requirements. Managers ensure that disciplinary and adverse actions
   comply with all legal and regulatory requirements.
      10.3.1. Third party review may find actions that don't comply with governing
      requirements defective, either procedurally or on merit or both. The third party may
      reverse the action or reduce the severity of the action.
      10.3.2. An action that is not sustained by a third party because of a harmful error in
      procedures may be initiated again if the Air Force corrects the deficiency. An action may
      not be initiated again if the third party's modification or reversal is based on the merits of
      the case.
11. Oral Admonishment.
   11.1. Supervisors:
      11.1.1. Issue oral admonishments to correct minor misconduct or delinquency or to
      motivate employees to improve their work habits, work methods, or behavior.
      11.1.2. Note the date they issue an oral admonishment on the employee's AF Form 971,
      Supervisor's Employee Brief.
          11.1.2.1. Delete the reference to the admonishment 2 years after the effective date.
   11.2. The Relationship of Oral Admonishment to Other Disciplinary Actions. An oral
   admonishment is informal and the least severe penalty enforced in the Air Force discipline
   program. Oral admonishments are disciplinary actions but not adverse actions. See
   paragraph 37.3 for an explanation of the use of oral admonishments in relation to
   Attachment 3.
   11.3. Difference From Performance Discussions or Counseling Sessions. Performance
   discussions and counseling sessions are nondisciplinary. Use them to guide, encourage, or
   instruct employees (see AFI 36-1001).
   11.4. Steps In Considering and Taking an Oral Admonishment. This paragraph sets out
   recommended steps for supervisors to follow when imposing an oral admonishment for an
   employee's misconduct or delinquency. These steps are not mandatory unless stated as such.
   EXCEPTION: Follow a collective bargaining agreement if it gives other instructions.
   Supervisors:
      11.4.1. Observe employee representation entitlements according to paragraph 27.
      11.4.2. Gather available facts.
 12                                               AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010


      11.4.3. Interview employees privately. Tell them the purpose of the interview. State the
      problem and the facts so they can clearly understand.
      11.4.4. Give employees an opportunity to answer and express their views on the matter.
      If employees request reasonable time for thought before responding, honor the request, if
      possible.
      11.4.5. Consider employees' answers and any explanations offered.
      11.4.6. Resolve any outstanding questions before making a decision. Advise employees
      that you will issue a decision as soon as possible and that you will tell them when you do.
      11.4.7. Determine appropriate action:
          11.4.7.1. If the discussion satisfactorily resolves the matter, tell the employees. Take
          no further action.
          11.4.7.2. If the discussion doesn't satisfactorily resolve the matter and you decide to
          issue an oral admonishment, tell the employees and explain why. Tell the employees
          that they are being disciplined by receipt of an oral admonishment. Identify areas
          where employees need improvement, suggest how they may do so, and offer to help.
      11.4.8. Document the admonishment on AF Form 971. Include:
              The words "oral admonishment" to distinguish the action from nondisciplinary
              counseling.
              A brief description of the reason for the admonishment.
              The effective date.
              A note that you advised the employee of the admonishment.
      11.4.9. Ask the employee to initial AF Form 971. See the requirements for recording
      and deleting references to oral admonishments in paragraphs 11.1.2 and 11.1.3.
NOTE: Employees' initials on AF Form 971 show their awareness of the oral admonishment,
not their agreement.


      11.4.10. Follow up on oral admonishments by offering help, making suggestions, and
      encouraging the employee to improve. Note these follow-up actions and any
      improvement in employees' conduct on AF Form 971.
12. Reprimand.
   12.1. Purpose and Use. Supervisors and managers use reprimands to correct significant
   misconduct or delinquency and repeated lesser offenses. It is a severe disciplinary action that
   should be adequate for many disciplinary situations requiring an action more severe than an
   oral admonishment.
      12.1.1. Supervisors make sure written reprimands are clearly identified with the subject:
      "Notice of Reprimand."
AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010                                                           13


     12.1.2. Supervisors send a copy of the "Notice of Reprimand" to the CPF for temporary
     filing in the employee's Standard Form 66, Official Personnel Folder (OPF), for 2 years
     from the date of the reprimand. The CPF destroys it when the 2 years expire.
     12.1.3. Supervisors note the date they issue a reprimand on the employee's AF Form 971.
     Delete the note when the reprimand expires.
     12.1.4. In the establishment of a progression of penalties (see paragraph             34.),
     supervisors may make a reprimand more "severe" by:
            Referencing previous offenses;
            Indicating the seriousness of their concern with the continued misconduct or
            delinquency; or
            Warning that a further offense could result in a more severe penalty. Note: Be
            sure to use the phrase, "could result" rather than "will result. "
     12.1.5. Supervisors may issue a reprimand as the last step in a progression of penalties if
     the written notice clearly warns that a further offense could lead to removal.
  12.2. The Relationship of Reprimands To Other Disciplinary Actions:
     12.2.1. A reprimand is the least severe formal penalty. It is a disciplinary action but not
     an adverse action. It carries the same weight as a suspension when it is used as a prior
     offense penalty to support the penalty imposed for a later offense.
     12.2.2. Reprimands may constitute a more severe penalty when:
            Air Force policy precludes the use of suspension.
            A suspension might be managerially unsound even though the offense is serious
            enough to warrant suspension.
            The offense doesn't warrant suspension but meets the criteria in paragraph 12.1.4.
  12.3. Difference From Letters Stating Standards or Requirements.
     12.3.1. Don't use letters documenting standards of conduct as disciplinary actions or
     reprimands.
     12.3.2. Don't use letters that establish special requirements, such as letters outlining
     leave approval procedures or warning employees of the potential consequences of certain
     delinquencies, as reprimands.
     12.3.3. Use reprimands to discipline employees who have been advised of management's
     expectations but fail to meet them for reasons within their control. Supervisors may
     restate these requirements in letters of reprimand.
  12.4. Steps In Considering and Taking a Reprimand. This paragraph sets out
  recommended steps for supervisors to follow when imposing a reprimand for an employee's
  misconduct or delinquency. The steps are not mandatory unless stated as such.
  EXCEPTION: Follow a collective bargaining agreement if it gives other instructions.
  Supervisors:
 14                                               AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010


      12.4.1. Complete the steps in this paragraph as soon and efficiently as possible but not
      necessarily during one session.
      12.4.2. Observe employees' right to representation according to paragraph 27.
      12.4.3. Gather available facts.
      12.4.4. Interview employees privately. Tell them the purpose of the interview. State the
      problem and the facts so they can clearly understand. If applicable, tell employees the
      interview serves as an oral notice of proposed reprimand.
NOTE: Unless a governing collective bargaining agreement provides otherwise, supervisors
must give employees a notice of proposed reprimand. The notice may be given orally or in
writing.


      12.4.5. Give employees an opportunity to answer and express their views on the matter.
      If employees request reasonable time for thought before answering, honor the request, if
      possible. Follow the guidelines in paragraph 28.
      12.4.6. Consider employees' answers and any explanations they offer according to
      paragraph 29.
      12.4.7. Resolve any outstanding questions before making a decision. Advise employees
      that you will issue a decision as soon as possible and that you will tell them when you do.
      12.4.8. Determine appropriate action:
          12.4.8.1. If the discussion satisfactorily resolves the matter, tell the employees. Take
          no further action.
          12.4.8.2. If the discussion doesn't satisfactorily resolve the matter and you decide an
          oral admonishment is adequate penalty under the circumstances, take the steps
          outlined in paragraphs 11.4.7 through 11.4.10
          12.4.8.3. If the discussion does not satisfactorily resolve the matter and you decide a
          reprimand might be warranted, tell employees that you have not made a decision but
          will tell them when you do so.
          12.4.8.4. If, after discussing the case with the CPF, you decide to reprimand the
          employee, prepare a "Notice of Reprimand" and coordinate it with the CPF before
          delivering it to the employee. Note: This notice is required. See paragraphs 17.5 and
          17.6 concerning the notice contents.
          12.4.8.5. Send documentation of the action to the CPF according to paragraphs
          12.1.2 and 20.
          12.4.8.6. Note the reprimand on the AF Form 971 according to paragraph 12.1.3
13. Suspensions:
   13.1. Purpose and Use:
      13.1.1. Consider a suspension, regardless of its duration, as an adverse action. Use it as
      a severe disciplinary action. Ordinarily, it is the final step in the disciplinary process
AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010                                                             15


      before removal action and is accompanied by a warning to employees that a further
      violation of rules could result in removal. Note: Be sure to state the warning in terms of
      "could" rather than "will" result in removal.
      13.1.2. A suspension prevents an employee from performing work and denies salary for
      the suspension period. Therefore, supervisors may not impose a suspension for
      indebtedness or for performance-related factors in nondisciplinary situations.
      13.1.3. Normally, you shouldn't suspend employees for more than 30 days.
   13.2. Suspensions for 14 Days or Less. When proposing a suspension for 14 days or less,
   supervisors must provide employees:
          Advance written notice stating the specific reasons for the proposed action (see
          paragraph 16.).
          A reasonable time, but not less than 24 hours, to answer charges orally and in writing
          and to furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of their answer.
          The right to representation by an attorney or other representative (see paragraph 27.).
          A written decision and the specific reasons for the decision at the earliest practicable
          date (see paragraph 17.).
      13.2.1. Normally, supervisors give employees 7 days to answer a proposed suspension
      for 14 days or less.
   13.3. Suspensions for More Than 14 days. See paragraph 14.4 for requirements for
   suspensions for more than 14 days.
14. Removal, Suspension for More Than 14 Days, Reduction in Grade or Pay, or Furlough
for 30 Days or Less.
   14.1. These actions include:
          Actions based solely on factors unrelated to performance.
          Actions based on factors both related and unrelated to performance.
          Actions based solely on factors related to performance that aren't covered by AFI 36-
          1001.
NOTE: See paragraph 15. for special procedures when a reduction in grade is based on
reclassification or job-grading determinations.
   14.2. Removal. A disciplinary removal is the most severe disciplinary action. Consider it
   rehabilitative since it could help employees improve their performance in future positions.
      14.2.1. Before initiating a removal, carefully review the facts and circumstances in each
      case. Make sure they support the conclusion that the employee has demonstrated
      unwillingness or refusal to conform to the rules of conduct or has so breached the
      employee-employer relationship that other rehabilitation is not appropriate and removal is
      warranted for the offense.
      14.2.2. Supervisors and managers may remove an employee:
              For misconduct on or off the job. (See paragraph 10.2.1.).
 16                                                AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010


              For actions before appointment which reflect upon the employee's suitability for
              federal employment.
       14.2.3. Normally, supervisors take a progression of disciplinary measures before
       deciding to remove employees. EXCEPTION: If employees commit egregious
       misconduct or flagrantly violate rules and regulations, supervisors may remove them for
       a first or second offense.
   14.3. Furlough for 30 Days or Less. For a furlough of any duration, managers must apply
   for prior approval from HQ USAF/DPC. Don't announce a proposed furlough before getting
   it approved.
       14.3.1. Submit requests through command channels and include:
              The reasons you consider a furlough necessary.
              The efforts you made to avoid the furlough.
              The number of employees involved, their skills, and the proposed length of the
              furlough.
   14.4. Action Requirements. Supervisors and managers give employees against whom they
   initiate an action under this paragraph or paragraph 15.:
           At least 30 days advance written notice stating the specific reasons for the proposed
           action. EXCEPTIONS: See paragraph 14.5.
           A reasonable time, but not less than 7 days, to answer your charges orally and in
           writing and to furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of their
           answer.
           The right to representation by an attorney or other representative (see paragraph 27.).
           A reasonable amount of official time to review the material relied on to support the
           proposed action, to prepare an answer, and to secure affidavits (see paragraph 28.1.).
           EXCEPTION: If the employee is covered by a collective bargaining agreement,
           follow the provisions of that agreement.
           A written decision and the specific reasons for the decision at the earliest practicable
           date (see paragraph 17.).
   14.5. Exceptions. (Additional information concerning use of the following exceptions is in
   5 CFR 752.404[d]).
       14.5.1. Crime Provision.
       14.5.2. Furlough Without Pay due To Unforeseeable Circumstances.

Section D—Change To Lower Grade Based on Reclassification or Job-Grading
Determination.

15. Change to Lower Grade. This paragraph addresses reduction in grade (demotion) of an
employee whose position is downgraded because of a determination that the position warrants
classification at a lower grade due to a classification error or job grading standard change when
the position has been classified at the higher grade for less than 1 year. Note: When demoting
AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010                                                            17


employees under the circumstances of this paragraph, managers also apply the provisions of
paragraphs 14.4 , 16., and 17.
   15.1. Contents of Notice of Proposed Adverse Action. In addition to the requirements of
   paragraph 16., managers make sure the notice of proposed adverse action:
           Contains a statement why the position is being downgraded (for example, because of
           an erroneous classification or because of the application of a new or revised
           standard).
           Encloses a copy of the official position description and either the OPM classification
           certificate or the classification decision of the Air Force comparing the grade
           controlling duties and responsibilities of the position with the applicable published
           classification or job-grading standards. EXCEPTION: If the classification guides and
           standards are too long to copy, include a statement outlining the arrangements you
           made for the employee to review the items.
       15.1.1. Proposing officials must not suggest in the notice of proposed adverse action that
       the notice constitutes a final decision to demote the employee. The notice may state,
       however, that the Air Force or OPM has decided to downgrade the position.
   15.2. Consideration of Employee's Answer. The employee's answer is considered by an
   Air Force official according to paragraph 5.2.2
       15.2.1. When the classification decision results from an OPM certificate, recommending
       or deciding officials need not consider or respond to employees' disagreement with that
       decision. EXCEPTION: If the Air Force classification decision was based on application
       of an OPM or Air Force precedent decision and employees' answers contest that decision,
       managers must consider and respond to employees' answers in notices of decision.
   15.3. Effective Date of Downgrading. The position may not be downgraded before the
   deciding official makes a final decision on the proposed demotion or the advance notice
   expires.

circumstances. Supervisors may deliver notices either personally or by mail.
   19.1. Normally, supervisors, or their designees, hand notices to employees and ask them to
   sign one copy, acknowledging receipt.          Should an employee refuse to sign the
   acknowledgement copy, the person making the delivery can sign and date a statement of
   delivery to include the place, date, and time of delivery, and note the employee's refusal to
   sign. Note: The employee's written acknowledgement doesn't indicate agreement with the
   notice.
   19.2. If personal delivery is impossible for some reason, supervisors must chose a method of
   mail delivery. This delivery method is important; seek advice about preferable means from
   the CPF.

       answers).
       The notice of decision including the specific reasons for it.
       Any order effecting the action.
       A statement of your reasoning as to the appropriateness of the penalty imposed in

       material).
   20.1. Send a copy of the file to the MSPB or Air Force Civilian Appellate Review Office,
   Appellate Review Division (AFCARO/ARD) if either asks for it and to the affected
   employee if requested by the employee.
   20.2. Retain records of reprimands for 2 years from the date of the notice of decision to
   reprimand. Screen and destroy expired reprimands from the Official Personnel Folders.
   Delete references to expired reprimands from the AF Form 971 (see paragraph 12.1.3).
   20.3. Delete references to oral admonishments from the AF Form 971 2 years from the date
   of the admonishments (see paragraph 11.1.2.1).
21. Advance Notice Period:
   21.1. Oral admonishments and reprimands require no minimum advance notice period.
   21.2. For a suspension for 14 days or less, supervisors must give at least 24 hours advance
   notice. Normally, supervisors give employees 7 days' notice.
   21.3. The minimum notice period for adverse actions under paragraph 14. and paragraph 15.
   is 30 days. EXCEPTION: See paragraph 14.5 for information on the use of a shortened
   notice period.
   21.4. Supervisors may take additional time if needed. You need not set a tentative date for
   action when issuing a notice of proposed action. In the notice of proposed action, state that
   any adverse action will go into effect "not earlier than ______ days (the number of days of
   advance notice) from the date you receive this notice."
22. Identification of the Proposed Action. In the notice of proposed action, supervisors state
the most severe action proposed. State the exact number of calendar days for proposed
suspensions. EXCEPTION: Provide no end date for indefinite suspensions. (See Attachment 1
for definition of indefinite suspension).
   22.1. Supervisors may later reduce a proposed action, but they can't make the proposed
   action more severe without canceling the original notice and giving the employee a new
   proposal. Don't propose the most severe action with the expectation that it may later be
   reduced.
 22                                                AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010


   22.2. When an adverse action results in pay reduction, state the employee's new salary in the
   notice. For a change to a lower grade, state the employee's exact pay plan, series, position
   title, and grade. If an employee doesn't qualify for grade retention, state whether the
   employee is entitled to pay retention.
23. Specific Reasons (Includes Causes of Action). In the notice of proposed action, state all
the specific reasons relied on to support the proposed action. (For reprimands, include this
information in the notice of reprimand unless a written notice of proposed reprimand was
issued.) Supervisors need not include every reason that might have been used to support their
proposed action.
   23.1. Normally, cover the current cause of action in the introductory paragraph of the notice
   of proposed action. Include supporting reasons (such as prior offenses) in separate
   paragraphs.
   23.2. The supervisor who initiates the action must identify and state the cause of action.
   Causes for adverse action may be reasons personal to the employee such as on or off-the-job
   misconduct, delinquency, or physical or mental inability to perform the duties of the position.
   Causes also may be impersonal reasons such as the application of new or revised
   classification standards or the need to correct a merit promotion error.
24. Adding Reasons. If supervisors amend a notice to add further reasons for action, they must
give employees sufficient time to answer the added reasons and take no action until the required
notice period expires. Note: The advance notice period starts again from the date the added
reasons are received by the employee.
25. Material Relied on To Support the Action. Supervisors assemble the material they relied
on to support the reasons for the proposed action and make the file available to the employee.
This material may include:
       Statements of witnesses.
       Documents.
       Investigative reports or extracts from the reports.
       Relevant material concerning any previous record or action that serves as the basis for the
       current action.
   25.1. Supervisors may enclose a copy of the supporting material with the notice of proposed
   action, stating in the notice that they've done so.
   25.2. Supervisors must allow employees, the employee's representative, or the employee's
   designated physician under 5 CFR 297.205 to review all supporting material. Don't use
   material to support your reasons for the action that can't be shown to these individuals.
26. The Official to Whom Employees Answer. Normally, the person who signs the notice of
final decision receives employees' oral or written answers. Managers may designate another
person to receive the answer as long as that person has the authority to recommend a final
decision and serves in a position superior to the employee (not necessarily in a supervisory
position or in a higher grade), or a designated CPF official (see paragraph 5.2.2).
AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010                                                             23


27. Employee Representation.
   27.1. Supervisors and managers must give a union representative of an appropriate
   bargaining unit the opportunity to be represented at any examination of an employee in the
   unit by a representative of the agency in connection with an investigation if:
          The employee reasonably believes the examination may result in disciplinary action
          against the employee and;
          The employee requests representation.
   27.2. Employees who receive a notice of proposed disciplinary or adverse action may get
   help preparing their answer. Employees may be represented by an attorney or other
   representative when making an oral answer to a proposed adverse action.
   27.3. Representatives may accompany employees answering charges orally or may answer
   for employees. Representatives' time qualifies as official duty time or as whatever the
   collective bargaining agreement states if representatives clear time in advance and serve in an
   active duty status.
      27.3.1. Employees in an exclusive bargaining unit have the right to representation
      according to the terms of any governing collective bargaining agreement.
      27.3.2. Employees who aren't in an exclusive bargaining unit have the right to be
      represented by the person of their choice, subject to paragraph 27.4 and paragraph 27.6
   27.4. Disallowing Representatives. Managers may disallow the employee's choice of
   representative if any of these criteria apply:
          Activities of the individual as a representative could cause a conflict of interest or
          position.
          Release of the individual from his or her duties could give rise to unreasonable costs
          to the Government.
          The individual's priority work assignments preclude his or her release to serve.
      27.4.1. Fully, clearly, and specifically state the basis for the disallowance in writing.
      Include citations of regulatory provisions and other authorities.
      27.4.2. Deliver the disallowance to the employee within 5 workdays after receiving
      notification of a designated representative or as soon as possible thereafter if the
      employee is unavailable.
      27.4.3. In an adjudication, use this notice of disallowance as the basic explanation of
      your position (see paragraph 27.6.2.1).
   27.5. Bargaining Unit Employees' Right To Challenge Disallowance of
   Representative. Employees in an exclusive bargaining unit may challenge the decision to
   disallow their choice of a representative through the collective bargaining agreement or 5
   U.S.C. 7118, as appropriate.
   27.6. Nonbargaining Unit Employees' Right to Challenge Disallowance of a
   Representative.
 24                                               AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010


       27.6.1. Employees who aren't in an exclusive bargaining unit have the right to challenge
       the decision to disallow their choice of a representative by addressing the challenge,
       through the CPF, to AFCARO/ARD.
           27.6.1.1. In the challenge, employees must explain why the representative should
           serve and why the manager's reasoning for disallowance is wrong.
           27.6.1.2. Employees must make sure the challenge is received by the CPF within 5
           days of the disallowance.
       27.6.2. Within 2 workdays after receipt of the employee's challenge, the CPF sends the
       file to AFCARO/ARD for decision.
           27.6.2.1. The CPF makes sure the file contains a clean, readable, and unmarked copy
           of the following documents, as applicable:
                  The designation of representation, the disallowance, and the employee's
                  challenge.
                  The employee's and the designated representative's official position
                  descriptions.

                  Relevant local and MAJCOM (or comparable organization) regulations.
                  Cases, policy statements, and other materials cited as authorities.
           27.6.2.2. When it is necessary to submit a marked copy, you must certify to the
           unavailability of an unmarked copy, and identify all extraneous markings.
       27.6.3. The CPF sends the employee an information copy of the transmittal letter to
       AFCARO/ARD.
       27.6.4. The Director of AFCARO, or designee, expedites a final decision based on the
       file received from the CPF.
       27.6.5. AFCARO/ARD sends the decision to the employee with an information copy to
       the CPF. These decisions aren't subject to further administrative review.
       27.6.6. Supervisors and managers wait for AFCARO's decision before taking any further
       action on the disciplinary or adverse action.
28. Employees' Answers. Employees who receive a written notice of proposed adverse action
may answer that notice to the designated official as many times as they wish. (See paragraph 30.

   28.1. Time Allowed:
       28.1.1. Supervisors must give employees a reasonable response period for:
              Obtaining advice and assistance.

       be given to employees) .
       28.1.3. Within the response period, supervisors must allow employees who request it a
       reasonable amount of official time for the purposes specified in paragraph 28.1.1
       EXCEPTION: Follow the applicable provisions of a collective bargaining agreement if
       the employee is covered by that agreement.
       28.1.4. Supervisors must determine reasonable total response time and reasonable
       official time for each action initiated. Base this determination on:
              The facts and circumstances of the individual case.
              The complexity of the issues involved the case.
              The amount and type of material in the file to be reviewed.
              The need for help and the employee's difficulty in getting it.
       28.1.5. Supervisors must honor reasonable requests from employees for additional time,
       if possible. Note: The Air Force authorizes no standard, predetermined definition of
       "reasonable. "
   28.2. Character of Answer. Employees may answer the notice of proposed action orally
   and in writing. When an employee answers the notice of proposed action orally, supervisors
   summarize the primary points of the interview. If possible, obtain the signature of the
   employee to show agreement with the record.
   28.3. Content of Answer. Supervisors must give employees the opportunity to answer in
   whatever way they think may influence the final decision in their favor or reduce the penalty.
       28.3.1. In their answers, employees may:
              Deny or dispute the charges.
              Address matters that aren't related solely to the charges in the notice of proposed

       29.1.1. If an employee's answer in any way refutes the reasons contained in the advance
       notice, the deciding official must review the evidence objectively and determine whether
       a "preponderance of evidence" supports the proposed action. That official decides
       whether the action stands, needs modification, or may be withdrawn.
   29.2. The person designated to receive employees' answers writes a letter explaining any
   management delays in reaching a final decision caused by the need to collect additional
   evidence or other unusual circumstances. Include the approximate date the final decision will
   be made.
   29.3. Under no circumstances may the deciding official base the decision to take an action
   solely on the conclusion that the employee "failed to refute" the charges.
30. Premature Appeal or Grievance. Employees may not grieve or appeal a notice of
proposed action or a notification that initiation of action is being contemplated. Designated
officials to receive employees' answers to notices of proposed actions consider an employee's
attempt to obtain appellate or grievance reconsideration of a proposed action to be an answer to
the notice of proposed action.
   30.1. Employees may contest final decisions that have gone into effect by filing a timely
   appeal or grievance.
31. Appeal and Grievance Rights. Disciplinary actions and adverse actions are subject to
review under the procedures of the MSPB, the Department of Defense (DoD), the Air Force, or
negotiated grievance procedures between the Air Force and exclusive collective bargaining units,
as applicable. Written notices of final decision contain specific information about those rights;
and, if alternatives exist, the employee is required to select the procedure to be used. Some
general rules are included below; but because not all employees have the same appellate or
grievance rights, an employee who has received a notice of final decision should carefully
review the appellate or grievance information in it and may ask CPF assistance on specific
questions.
   31.1. Oral Admonishments, Reprimands, and Suspension for 14 Days or
   Less. Bargaining unit employees with access to a negotiated grievance procedure may grieve
   those actions through that procedure only.
       31.1.1. Bargaining unit employees without access to a negotiated grievance procedure
       and nonbargaining unit employees may grieve such actions through the DoD grievance
       procedure in DoDCPM 1400.25-M, Chapter 7, Subchapter 13, Administrative Grievance
       System.
   31.2. Removals, Suspensions for More Than 14 Days, Reduction in Grade or Pay, or
   Furlough for 30 Days or Less.
       31.2.1. Employees who may appeal an action covered by paragraph 31.2 to the MSPB or
       grieve the action through the negotiated grievance procedure of a collective bargaining
       agreement, where applicable, but not both, include:
           31.2.1.1. An employee in the competitive service who has completed a probationary
           or trial period.
           31.2.1.2. An employee in the competitive service serving in an appointment that
           requires no probationary or trial period, and who has completed 1 year of current
AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010                                                              27


           continuous service in the same or similar positions under other than a temporary
           appointment limited to 1 year or less.
           31.2.1.3. An employee in the excepted service who is a preference eligible and who
           has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar position.
           31.2.1.4. Unless excluded by 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(8), an employee in the excepted
           service who is a nonpreference eligible and who has completed 2 years of current
           continuous service in the same or similar positions under other than a temporary
           appointment limited to 2 years or less.
           31.2.1.5. An employee with competitive status who occupies a position in Schedule
           B of 5 CFR, Part 213.
           31.2.1.6. An employee who was in the competitive service at the time his or her
           position was listed under Schedule A, B, or C of the excepted service and still
           occupies that position.
           EXCEPTION: See paragraph 2.1. for the employees excluded from this instruction.


       31.2.2. An employee not included in paragraphs 31.2.1.1 through 31.2.1.6, but who has
       received an action covered by 31.2, may grieve such action through the DoD grievance
       procedure in DoDCPM 1400.25-M, Chapter 7, Subchapter 13, Administrative Grievance
       System, unless that procedure excludes either the employee or the action being grieved
       from its coverage.

Section F—Selection of Appropriate Disciplinary Actions.

32. Penalty Selection. Supervisors determine which penalty to impose in a particular situation
by applying responsible judgement to Air Force disciplinary policy. Take the disciplinary action
on the basis of conclusions that sufficient evidence is available to support the reasons for action
and that the action is warranted and reasonable in terms of the circumstances which prompted it.
   32.1. Governing Criteria. Supervisors observe the principle of "like penalties for like
   offenses in like circumstances." Apply penalties as consistently as possible considering the
   particular circumstances of the cause for disciplinary action.
       32.1.1. Don't apply penalties with "...mathematical rigidity or perfect consistency
       regardless of variations in circumstances or changes in prevailing regulations, standards,
       or mores," (Douglas v. Veterans Administration, et al., MSPB Decision No.
       AT075299006, 10 April 1981).
       32.1.2. Supervisors consider all relevant penalty selection factors. Select penalties that
       aren't disproportionate to the offense and contribute to the solution of the problem and to
       the attainment of an effective management environment.
   32.2. Factors in Penalty Selection. Some of the factors that may be relevant in selecting
   the appropriate penalty are listed at paragraphs 32.2.1 through 32.2.12 Not all of the factors
   will be relevant in every case and others may be relevant in particular cases. Selection of an
   appropriate penalty (including a reprimand) involves a responsible balancing of the relevant
   factors based on the individual case. Some of the relevant factors may weigh in the
 28                                                AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010


   employee's favor while others may not or may even cause management to view the situation
   as more serious and deserving of a more severe penalty than originally thought. When
   selecting a penalty, supervisors and managers consider the following factors:
       32.2.1. The nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the employee's
       duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or
       technical or inadvertent, or was committed maliciously or for gain, or was frequently
       repeated.
       32.2.2. The employee's job level and type of employment, including supervisory or
       fiduciary role, contacts with the public, and prominence of the position.
       32.2.3. The employee's past disciplinary record.
       32.2.4. The employee's past work record, including length of service, performance on the
       job, ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability.
       32.2.5. The effect of the offense upon the employee's ability to perform at a satisfactory
       level and its effect upon supervisors' confidence in the employee's ability to perform
       assigned duties.
       32.2.6. The consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the
       same or similar offenses in like or similar circumstances.
       32.2.7. The consistency of the penalty with the Guide to Disciplinary Actions
       (Attachment 3).
       32.2.8. The notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the Air Force.
       32.2.9. The clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were
       violated in committing the offense, or had been warned about the conduct in question.
       32.2.10. The potential for the employee's rehabilitation.
       32.2.11. The mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense such as unusual job
       tensions, personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, or bad faith, malice or
       provocation on the part of others involved in the matter.
       32.2.12. The adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in
       the future by the employee or others.
   32.3. Penalty Support. If an employee grieves or appeals an action, supervisors and
   managers must prepare to support the appropriateness of the penalty (see paragraph 10.2.1).
       32.3.1. Supervisors and managers must include a statement of their reasoning as to the
       appropriateness of the penalty imposed in the record described in paragraph 20.
33. The Guide To Disciplinary Actions (Attachment 3). The guide helps supervisors and
managers select appropriate penalties by providing a framework for interrelating all the relevant
facts to possible courses of action and to available penalties. Use it to evaluate causes of action
(offenses), whether or not specifically described, so that a sound, supportable penalty may be
selected. Avoid mechanical use of the guide. The guide is an expression of typical causes and
typical penalties only; therefore, causes of action and penalties in the guide may not meet the
demands of all situations. Use it as guidance along with supervisory judgment in considering the
AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010                                                                29


particular circumstances of the matter and the appropriateness of the particular action
contemplated.
   33.1. Cause of Action. The "Cause of Action" column in the guide explains many of the
   common offenses, but it does not include every possible one. In using that column to apply
   general Air Force policy, supervisors compare each cause of action in the particular case at
   hand to all of those described and use those that relate to the situation. If there is a
   corresponding cause of action shown in the guide, use it to guide further consideration. If the
   cause of action in the particular case at hand is not shown, supervisors fit that offense into the
   general framework by relating its nature and seriousness to the fundamental characters of
   those listed. Supervisors need not use the precise language in the guide to describe an
   offense.
   33.2. Typical Penalty.
       33.2.1. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the "Typical Penalty" column in the guide
       establishes a range of penalties for a particular or comparable offense, not a required one.
       The guide prescribes no minimum penalty for any cause of action, except where required
       by law or executive order. Supervisors may not establish a minimum penalty by policy
       statement or by implementing instruction. Unless restricted by law or executive order,
       supervisors and managers may impose no penalty at all or may choose from penalties
       ranging from oral admonishment to removal.
       33.2.2. When considering which offense column of the guide to use, supervisors and
       managers need not establish that an employee's prior offenses were of the same character
       as the current offense. The severity of the penalty depends on the relationship of the
       current offense to relevant factors including those discussed in paragraph 32.2 See
       Attachment 3 for further guidance on how to determine the penalty.
34. Progression of Penalties. Supervisors and managers apply increasingly more severe
penalties as the employee continues to breach the employee-employer relationship. Such a
progression establishes a constructive disciplinary process (see paragraph 7.).
   34.1. Supervisors usually begin a progression of penalties with oral admonishments and
   proceed through reprimand to suspension. If employees continue not to meet their
   responsibilities, the supervisor may end the progression of penalties in removal.
   34.2. For example: if the supervisor imposed a 3-day suspension for a first offense, a second
   offense would call for at least a 3-day suspension, even though the applicable items in the
   guide might show a range of reprimand to removal. Similarly, if a supervisor imposed a 5-
   day suspension for a second offense, consideration of the penalty to be imposed for a third
   offense would begin with a 5-day suspension.
   34.3. Supervisors impose a removal for misconduct or delinquency only after a progression
   of penalties unless discharge for a first or second offense is clearly warranted.
   34.4. Supervisors need not include suspensions in a progression if the preceding reprimands
   clearly show that removal could result from repetitive improper behavior (see paragraph
   12.1.4 and paragraph 12.1.5).
35. Combination of Offenses. A particular situation may involve only one offense, may appear
to involve more than one offense when there is actually only one, may involve more than one
 30                                                AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010


significant offense, or may involve more than one offense only one of which is significant.
Avoid multiplying a single offense into several by including petty instances in your notice of
proposed action when the significant offense provides ample basis for taking necessary action.
   35.1. When different, significant offenses occur in combination, supervisors may include
   each offense as a cause of action. In this case, supervisors may impose a more severe penalty
   than would be appropriate for a single offense; but the penalty normally will not exceed that
   typically imposed for the most serious offense as determined by applying the appropriate
   offense column of the guide for the number of offenses in combination, including any prior
   offenses.
36. Series of Offenses. A series of offenses occurs when more than one offense is committed
by an employee at different times and appropriate action could not be completed on each of these
offenses individually before another was committed, even though management has proceeded at
a reasonable pace. Supervisors may assess a more serious penalty for a series of offenses than
would be appropriate for a single offense. However, the penalty imposed normally will not
exceed the most severe shown in the appropriate offense column of the guide (considering the
number of offenses in the series and any prior offenses) for the most serious cause of action in
the series.
37. Prior Offenses. See Attachment 1. Supervisors may use an employee's prior offenses in
determining the severity of the penalty for a current offense even though the prior offenses may
have involved different infractions. When used in this manner, supervisors show the prior
offenses and the resulting penalties imposed in the notice of proposed action (if any) and in the
notice of final decision.
   37.1. Supervisors may consider a suspension as a prior offense only if its effective date fell
   within the 3 years preceding the date of the current notice of proposed action.
   37.2. Supervisors may consider an oral admonishment or a reprimand as a prior offense only
   if its effective date fell within the 2 years preceding the date of the current notice of proposed
   action.
   37.3. Supervisors may not consider a breach of the employee-employer relationship for
   which an oral admonishment was imposed as an "offense" for the purpose of applying
   Attachment 3.
       37.3.1. Supervisors may use an oral admonishment to support their decision that a
       reprimand would be an appropriate penalty. Don't use an oral admonishment to support
       selection of an adverse action penalty.
       37.3.2. Supervisors may use an oral admonishment in any disciplinary action to
       document that an employee has been apprised of a rule, regulation, other directive, or of
       his or her past misconduct or delinquency.

                                    GLOSSARY OF TERMS


Adverse Action— A removal, suspension, furlough for 30 days or less, or reduction in grade or
pay. These actions don't include those resulting from reduction in force. Adverse actions may or
may not be for disciplinary reasons.
Bargaining Unit Employee— An employee included in an appropriate bargaining unit for
which a labor organization has been granted exclusive recognition.
Cause of Action— A recognizable offense against the employee-employer relationship such as a
violation of rule, regulation or procedure; employment-related off-duty misconduct; failure to
fulfill an employment-related agreement; or a mandatory requirement to take an action personal
to an employee. It is disciplinary if it results from delinquency or misconduct by the employee.
(A disciplinary cause of action is also called an offense.) It is nondisciplinary, for example, if it
results from the employee's disability, the employee's declination of functional transfer, or a
management determination such as reclassification of the employee's position or termination of
an extended temporary promotion.
Charge— Sometimes used to refer to the reason stated in notices of proposed action and of final
decision when the reason is disciplinary.
Counseling— A nondisciplinary method of providing information, instruction, guidance, advice,
assistance, or encouragement. Don't confuse counseling with oral admonishment, which is
disciplinary.
Current Continuous Employment— A period of employment or service immediately
preceding an adverse action in the same or similar positions without a break in Federal civilian
employment of a workday.
Days— Days refers to consecutive calendar days, including holidays, weekends, and other
nonduty days.
Disciplinary Action— An action management takes to correct an employee's delinquency or
misconduct. Included are oral admonishments, reprimands, suspensions, removals and, in some
cases, reductions in grade or pay. Except for oral admonishments and reprimands, these
disciplinary actions are also adverse actions.
Furlough— A nondisciplinary action placing an employee in a temporary nonduty and nonpay
status because of lack of work or funds or for other nondisciplinary reasons. A furlough is an
adverse action if it is for a period of 30 calendar days or less. A furlough for more than 30
calendar days is a reduction-in-force action covered by 5 CFR Part 351.
Grade— A level of classification under a position classification system.
Harmful Error— An error by management in the application of its procedures that is likely to
have caused management to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in
the absence or cure of the error.
Indefinite Suspension— The placing of an employee in a temporary status without duties and
pay pending investigation, inquiry, or further agency action. The indefinite suspension continues
AFI36-704_MACDILLSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010                                                              33


for an indeterminate period of time and ends with the occurrence of the pending conditions set
forth in the notice of action which may include the completion of any subsequent administrative
action.
Nexus— A reasonable connection or factual relationship between the reasons for the action
taken and the efficiency of the service.
Nondisciplinary Adverse Action— An adverse action that is taken for reasons other than to
correct an employee's delinquency or misconduct.
Offense— A cause of action due to an employee's delinquency or misconduct.
Oral Admonishment— A disciplinary discussion between a management official who has
authority to take disciplinary action and an employee subject to that authority in which the
employee is informed that he or she has been disciplined by receipt of an oral admonishment. It
is a disciplinary action which is not an adverse action.
Pay— The rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an
employee.
Preponderance of the Evidence— The degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person,
considering the record as a whole, would accept as sufficient to find that a contested fact is more
likely to be true than untrue.
Prior Offense— A prior cause of action for which a disciplinary penalty has been imposed.
Reason— Includes the current cause of action and facts, circumstances, and considerations
relied on to support the action (for example, prior offenses).
Reprimand— A formal disciplinary letter issued to an employee by a management official who
has authority to discipline the employee. It is a disciplinary action which is not an adverse
action.
Similar Positions— Positions in which the duties performed are similar in nature and character
and require substantially the same or similar qualifications, so that the incumbent could be
interchanged between the positions without significant training or undue interruption to the
work.
Suspension— An action placing an employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a temporary status
without duties and pay. A suspension is a disciplinary action and an adverse action.

                           GUIDE TO DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS

NOTE: See Section F of this regulation for information concerning use of this guide and
selection of appropriate penalties in disciplinary actions:
A3.1. Cause of Action Column:
   A3.1.1. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION EXACTLY AS
   SHOWN IN THIS COLUMN. What is important is to state exactly what the employee did
   wrong, preferably without using legal terms suggesting crime. If such legal terms were used,
   it might be necessary to prove all the elements necessary to establish that the crime has been
   committed, including felonious intent.
   A3.1.2. Cause is best identified by a specific charge or label for the offense IF that charge or
   label is relevant. BE CAREFUL TO SELECT A LABEL WHICH FITS THE FACTS
   AND NOT TO DISTORT THE FACTS TO FIT A SPECIFIED OFFENSE IN THE
   GUIDE.
A3.2. Typical Penalty Column. This column does not dictate the penalty to be imposed for a
particular (or comparable) offense; rather, it establishes the range of penalties within which the
penalty imposed usually falls. Unless otherwise restricted, management may impose no penalty
at all or has available a choice of severity of action ranging from oral admonishment to removal.
   A3.2.1. Oral Admonishment. An oral admonishment is a disciplinary action that is often
   adequate to effect the required correction or improvement, particularly when the employee
   has no previous history of violations. See paragraph 37.3 for the use of the oral
   admonishment in relation to this attachment.
   A3.2.2. Reprimand. A reprimand is a severe disciplinary action that should be adequate for
   many disciplinary situations which require an action more severe than an oral admonishment.
   It may be made more "severe" according to paragraph 12.1.4
   A3.2.3. Suspension. A suspension is a severe disciplinary action. Ordinarily, it is the final
   step in the disciplinary process before removal and is accompanied by a warning to the
   employee that a further violation of rules COULD result in removal (see paragraph 13.1.1)
       A3.2.3.1. A suspension may NOT be imposed for indebtedness nor performance-related
       factors when the situation is nondisciplinary.
       A3.2.3.2. Suspensions seldom should exceed 30 days unless an indefinite suspension is
       used.
   A3.2.4. Removal. Removal is the most severe disciplinary action. Before it is initiated, the
   facts and circumstances in the case must be carefully reviewed to ensure they support the
   conclusion that the employee has demonstrated unwillingness or refusal to conform to the
   rules of conduct or has so breached the employee-employer relationship that other
   rehabilitation is not appropriate and removal is warranted for the offense.
