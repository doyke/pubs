1.1. General. This instruction implements AFI 11-202V1, AFSOC Sup 1, and provides for
training management of Non-Standard Aviation (NSAv) assigned and attached aircrew members.
Training policy, guidance, and requirements are set forth for each phase of aircrew training.
Training is designed to progressively develop the combat readiness of each aircrew member,
while maintaining previously acquired proficiency.
   1.1.1. Qualification Training (chapter 2) qualifies aircrew members for basic, non-tactical
   aircrew duties.
   1.1.2. Mission Qualification Training (chapter 3) qualifies aircrew members in an assigned
   aircrew position for a specific aircraft, to perform the command or unit tactical aircrew
   duties.
   1.1.3. Continuation Training (chapter 4) provides the capability for aircrew members to
   reinforce and build upon previous training and conduct continuation aircrew training
   designed to enhance aircrew readiness. An aircrew member in continuation training may be
   assigned mission ready (MR), basic mission capable (BMC), or basic aircraft qualification
   (BAQ) status. Continuation training provides aircrew members the capability to reinforce
   and build upon previous training and conduct Air Force Task List (AFTL), United States
   Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Joint Mission Essential Task List (JMETL), and
   AFSOC Mission Essential Task List (METL)-based, combat-oriented aircrew training.
   1.1.4. Upgrade/Specialized Training (chapter 5) upgrades an aircrew member to aircraft
   commander (AC), instructor, or flight examiner in their respective crew position. It also
   provides selected aircrew members training leading to special mission event qualification or
   certification.
1.2. Training Objective. The overall objective of the aircrew training program is to develop
and maintain a high state of aircrew readiness to facilitate immediate and effective employment
in non-standard aviation missions, exercises, contingencies, limited war, and general war
operations.
   1.2.1. The training program must train aircrew in the skills, knowledge, and attitudes (SKA)
   required in accomplishing assigned missions. Regulatory, directive, and authoritative
   sources of required information include but may not be limited to AFI 11-202V3, AFSOC
   Sup 1., General Flight Rules, Mission Design Series (MDS)-specific instructions, Federal

1.4. Aircrew Training Policy.
   1.4.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness
   consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for
   realism against the expected threat, crewmember capabilities, and safety. This
   instruction/volume provides training guidelines and policies for use with operational
   procedures specified in applicable flying/operations publications
   1.4.2. Training missions will be designed to achieve combat capability in squadron-tasked
   roles, maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. Training
   missions will emphasize basic combat skills or scenarios that reflect procedures and
   operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition
   capabilities.
   1.4.3. Sortie Allocation Guidance
      1.4.3.1. In general, inexperienced crewmembers should receive sortie allocation priority
      over experienced crewmembers. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows:
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011                                                                   13


         1.4.3.1.1. Squadron-assigned CMR
         1.4.3.1.2. FTU(AFSOTC) CMR/BMC

         1.4.3.1.4. Wing-assigned CMR
         1.4.3.1.5. Wing-assigned MQT
         1.4.3.1.6. Wing-assigned BMC
  1.4.4. The primary training method for NSAv initial qualification, requalification, or
  upgrade training is attendance at a formal school. USAF policy dictates the use of formal
  schools unless attendance is impractical. The secondary method is in-unit training using
  applicable formal school courseware. If no formal school exists, primary method is via
  MAJCOM approved in unit training. Secondary method training (SMT) requires a waiver be
  submitted through appropriate channels per this instruction and approved by HQ AFSOC/A3.
  Note: Formal schools will not forward written examinations as part of the courseware for in-
  unit qualification training. Any aircrew member who was previously disenrolled from a
  formal course for substandard performance is ineligible for a secondary method training
  waiver. AFSOTC is the primary source for formal training products. When specific formal
  courseware is not published, use of locally developed training syllabi is authorized. Units
  will forward locally developed syllabi for in-unit training to HQ AFSOC/A3T for review and
  approval.
  1.4.5. Secondary Method Training (SMT). Aircrew members (primary or supervisory) must
  complete SMT within 120 days from the date of their first syllabus event or first flight,
  whichever occurs first. Individuals will start training within 60 days of reporting for duty or
  within 60 days or being selected for additional airframe qualification.. Individuals unable to
  complete training within these limits may continue training; however, their units will notify
  HQ AFSOC/A3T with a description of the difficulty and expected completion date (not to
  exceed an additional 120 days). If SMT is not completed by this date, any further extension
  requires HQ AFSOC/A3 approval. Commanders will ensure aircrew personnel engaged in
  qualification or requalification training complete their training in a timely and uninterrupted
  manner. Duties not directly related to qualification or requalification training should be
  minimized.
     1.4.5.1. Formal School courseware requests. For SMT, the waiver authority (per Table
     1.1) will include the appropriate formal school as an addressee on all correspondence and
     will request that the formal school forward applicable courseware to the aircrew
     member’s unit of assignment. Courseware includes but is not limited to; the course
     syllaus, briefings, Computer Based Training (CBT) modules, student and instructor
     guides, and training guides and grade sheets for the student’s training folder. The unit
     training office will verify the current version is used.
     1.4.5.2. Complete academic, ground, and flight training outlined in the courseware.
     When the courseware is adapted for local use, modify it only if the training is
     incompatible with local training conditions (e.g., simulator not available).
     1.4.5.3. AFSOC approved differences training may be conducted in unit without a
     waiver (see chapters 2 and 3).
 14                                                         AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011


       1.4.5.4. Units conducting training where a waiver is not required (i.e., complete training
       for restricted AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, AFSOC approved
       differences training) will send a request for any applicable courseware through channels
       to HQ AFSOC/A3T, with an information copy to the appropriate formal school. Include
       unit point of contact (name, rank, office symbol, and telephone number) and the name
       and rank of the individual who will receive the training.
1.5. Additional aircraft training.
   1.5.1. When an aircrew member receives training in an additional aircraft from sources
   outside the unit, the individual must provide documentation to squadron training. Squadron
   CC will approve all additional training. This documentation should include copies of
   logbook entries, endorsements, other certificates of training, and/or airmen certificates. This
   documentation will be maintained for one year in an AF Form 4109 .
   1.5.2. Additional aircraft training documentation will be routed through the squadron
   training office to squadron stan/eval to be documented in the individuals Flight Evaluation
   Folder (FEF).
   1.5.3. Training Restrictions. Additional aircraft may be a designated primary aircraft for
   pilots only if the aircraft is certified for IFR flight. Other crewmembers may be assigned
   additional aircraft as primary at the discretion of the unit DO.
   1.5.4. Aircrew will not maintain currency in more than two aircraft (HQ AFSOC/A3V is
   approval authority for NSAv aircrew qualification in more than two aircraft). Exception:
   Unit and HQ AFSOC evaluators will not maintain currency in more than three aircraft ( HQ
   AFSOC/A3 is approval authority for NSAv aircrew qualification in more than three aircraft).
1.6. Training Forms. Aircrew training records and forms will be established and maintained
per chapter 6 of this instruction.
   1.6.1. AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications, or AF Form 1381, USAF Certification
   of Air Crew Training, will be used to document ground/flying training associated with
   mission qualification, and to document instructor certified and one-time/initial flying training
   events. The AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381 is maintained in the individual’s FEF per AFI
   11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.
   1.6.2. The following forms aid management of aircrew training programs.
       1.6.2.1. AF Form 4109, SOF/CSAR Aircrew Training Record, is used as the training
       record jacket to document in-unit qualification or upgrade of an aircrew member. It
       documents applicable ground training, special function training, part task training,
       cockpit procedures training, simulator training, and flying training accomplished by
       crewmembers.
       1.6.2.2. AF Form 4110, Comments – SOF/CSAR Training Record, is used to document
       narrative comments on aircrew training activities.
       1.6.2.3. AF Form 4111, SOF/CSAR Training Record, is used to list required proficiency
       levels (RPL), indicate events for training sortie completion, and to document
       demonstrated student task and subtask performance and knowledge proficiency levels.
       Units are authorized to overprint and reproduce AF Form 4111 for approved course
       syllabi. The number of training tasks in the appropriate training guide is a recommended
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011                                                                       15


       minimum, which normally allows the student to achieve proficiency. It is neither
       intended to restrict the number of times the task must be accomplished nor restrict
       proficiency advancement.
   1.6.3. IAW the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP), personnel in Air Force
   specialty code (AFSC) 1AXXX are exempt from maintaining on the job training (OJT)
   training folders (AF Form 623).
1.7. Aircrew Training While DNIF. Crewmembers whose status is ―duty not involving
flying‖ (DNIF) may log ground training events, including simulator training, if the member’s
physical condition allows. Consult the flight surgeon initiating AF Form 1042, Medical
Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty, actions if the DNIF status includes
ground training limitations.
1.8. In-flight Supervision. Unless specifically directed, the unit commander/director of
operations determines the level of supervision necessary to accomplish required training. If the
mission objectives include introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies,
then an instructor is generally required.
   1.8.1. All squadron instructors should be CMR. Attached instructors may maintain BMC
   status with approval of the SQ/CC/.
   1.8.2. The following personnel must be supervised by an instructor from a like crew position
   when performing aircrew duties:
       1.8.2.1. Non-current crewmembers.
       1.8.2.2. Crewmembers in initial, difference, upgrade or requalification flying training.
       1.8.2.3. Unqualified crewmembers and Senior officers who have not completed initial
       qualification as outlined in chapter 2 and as outlined in Paragraph 1.11.
   1.8.3. For unqualified, non-current, or senior officer pilots, the instructor pilot must be at a
   set of controls during critical phases of flight, or when an individual is regaining currency or
   qualification in specific events.
1.9. Service Commitments. Formal training, either primary or secondary method, conducted
per this instruction may incur a service commitment IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service
Commitments (ADSC). Reference the appropriate AFI for program specifics. Individuals will
acknowledge the incurred service commitment (SC) by signing the appropriate Service
Commitment Acknowledgement Statement, prior to entering training, PCS, or departure from
home station. The unit training officer will notify AFPC/DPSFO via the servicing MPF once
training is complete.
1.10. Waivers: HQ USAF/A3O is the waiver authority for training requirements specified in
AFI 11-202V1, which has been delegated to HQ AFSOC/A3 for specific aircrew training events
(case by case basis).      These requirements currently include initial Cockpit Resource
Management(CRM) training, initial aircrew flight equipment and procedures training, Survival
Evasion Resistance and Escape (SERE), flight evaluations, and egress training (see AFI 11-
202V1, for specific guidance). For case-by-case individual waivers for flight physical and
physiological training currencies, HQ AFSOC/SGP and AFMSA/SGPA are the respective
waiver authorities. Some ground training items (e.g., small arms training, water survival, etc.)
are tasked by other agencies. Reference the source instruction to determine the waiver authority

   1.10.1. Waivers to the requirements of this instruction will be submitted via message, memo,
   fax, or E-mail through the group training office to the group commander, and then to HQ
   AFSOC/A3T for approval, unless otherwise specified. Group commanders are the delegated
   waiver authority for flying hour requirements and for ground and flying training
   requirements as outlined below in paragraph 1.10.4. and 1.10.5. Groups will keep an
   accurate record of waivers granted and notify HQ AFSOC/A3T, as appropriate, by message
   when such waivers or extensions are issued.
      1.10.1.1. Units will maintain waiver logs for one year. As a minimum, track the
      following information: Waiver type, approval authority, approval date, waiver number,
      waiver expiration date, and copy of the signed waiver.
   1.10.2. General Waiver Format. Name, grade, flying organization (assigned or attached),
   present crew position (including special mission qualifications), total flying time and primary
   aircraft assigned (PAA) time (including instructor, evaluator and aircraft specific simulator
   time, if applicable) and justification, crew qualification to which member is qualifying or
   upgrading, scheduled training start date, expected upgrade or qualification date, date last
   event accomplished, remarks, and requesting unit point of contact (include name, rank,
   telephone number, and office symbol). Waiver format templates are available on the HQ
   AFSOC/A3T Community of Practice (CoP).
   1.10.3. Units requesting waivers for SMT in-unit qualification, mission qualification, or
   upgrade of an aircrew member will send requests through appropriate channels to HQ
   AFSOC/A3T. Formal schools will forward current copies of courseware materials to units
   semi-annually. Maintain copies of waivers in the individual’s training folder. If the training
   incurs an ADSC per paragraph 1.9., include the statement ―Individual acknowledged receipt
   of ADSC by signing the AF Form 63, Active Duty Service Commitment Acknowledgement
   Statement on (date AF Form 63 signed).‖
   1.10.4. Operations Group(OG) commander may:
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011                                                                    17


       1.10.4.1. Waive 10 percent of the total and PAA hours required for upgrade in crew
       positions, on an individual basis only. Waive 50% of required PAA hours for the same
       qualification in additional NSAv aircraft (e.g., PC-12 Instructor Pilot(IP) to M-28 IP). A
       copy of the waiver must be filed in the individual’s training record. Students attending
       formal school will bring a waiver letter to the formal school for insertion into their
       training record.
       1.10.4.2. Extend ground training requirement due dates up to 2 months for Note 1 items
       in Table AX.4.2 on an individual basis only. Exception: Items referenced in paragraph
       1.6. levied by other AFIs may not be waived by the OG/CC unless specifically authorized
       to do so in the source AFI). These events may count towards the next periodic
       requirements (units should note on waiver when events were accomplished and the
       ARMS due date should be updated.
       1.10.4.3. Extend due dates for the duration of an exercise, contingency or operational
       mission for Table AX.4.2 events on an individual basis only if a crewmember goes
       overdue while away from home station and the training is not available at the deployed
       location. Exception: Items referenced in paragraph 1.6. levied by other AFIs may not be
       waived by the OG/CC unless specifically authorized to do so in the source AFI.
       1.10.4.4. Waive flying training requirements (Table AX.4.3 and Table AX.4.4 except as
       otherwise noted) on an individual basis only. Wings/groups must keep an accurate record
       of waivers granted. Notify HQ AFSOC/A3T when waivers are issued.
   1.10.5. Unit commanders may carry new crewmembers as ―mission ready‖ (MR) for up to
   six months if an aircrew member arrives at the unit after a PCS or formal school and is not
   MR in all core mission events. Units must notify HQ AFSOC/A3T of any OG/CC
   extensions. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform events in which they are not
   qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. This policy does not apply to
   basic aircraft qualification events. If training is not complete in six months, the aircrew
   member becomes ―non-mission ready‖ (NMR). Squadrons will have six months from the
   time a new core mission event is added and MAJCOM guidance issued to train and qualify
   aircrew in the new event.
1.11. Senior Officer Flying/Supervisory Aircrew. See AFI 11-202V1, AFSOC Sup 1, for
more information on senior officer flying/supervisory aircrew guidance.
1.12. Intra-command and Inter-command Transfer of Aircrews. For intra-command
transfer of aircrew members, the gaining organization will honor validated training completed by
newly assigned crewmembers prior to the transfer. For inter-command transfer, certifications
and qualifications should be accepted to the maximum extent practical, as long as training and
evaluation standards are equivalent. The operations officer at the gaining unit should review the
individual's career training folder and flight evaluation folder to determine which certifications
and qualifications will be honored. Aircrew members qualified in the same MDS are considered
qualified in that equipment throughout the force when used for the same mission.
   1.12.1. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Screening. Losing units will screen individual
   flight and ground training records during unit out-processing. Accomplish this screening in
   sufficient time to correct discrepancies prior to PCS. Losing unit will provide a printed copy
 18                                                         AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011


   of current ground and flying training summaries to individuals prior to PCS. See AFI 11-
   401, Aviation Management, for additional guidance.
   1.12.2. Instructor training and qualifications may be accepted at the discretion of the gaining
   unit commander.
1.13. Initial Cadre for Change of Aircraft, Equipment, or Capability. When possible,
qualified personnel in other units operating like equipment will provide the initial cadre. In some
instances, it will be necessary for units converting from one design aircraft to another to form an
initial cadre of aircrew personnel for whom certain training qualification requirements may be
waived. Authorization to form initial cadre crews will be contained in the conversion program
action directive. Unless otherwise stated in the program action directive, the following
conditions will apply to management of initial cadre aircrew qualification for aircraft conversion:
   1.13.1. A nucleus of personnel (initial cadre) will be formed to begin aircrew training.
   Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held; for example,
   PC-12 IP to M-28 flight examiner.
   1.13.2. Units will send proposed initial cadre list by name, rank, current crew position and
   aircraft, total flying time, and requested crew qualification level through channels to
   AFSOC/A3 for approval.
       1.13.2.1. Following final approval, publish a squadron letter to identify initial cadre
       instructors and flight examiners by aircraft and crew qualification and file in each cadre
       individual’s FEF (Tab 2).
       1.13.2.2. If a checkride was accomplished, enter appropriate comments in the remarks
       section of AF Form 8 explaining the individual’s status as initial cadre instructor or flight
       examiner.
   1.13.3. Initial cadre is not required for minor aircraft modifications when any required
   training for that modification is provided by the contractor and/or can easily be accomplished
   in-unit. Conduct differences training for the new equipment and log training on a letter of Xs
   or Memo for Record (MFR). Crewmembers will not fly with new equipment until trained.
   1.13.4. The initial cadre will be responsible for the development of:
       1.13.4.1. Training materials for aircraft qualification and tactical qualification for
       applicable crew positions. As a minimum, these training materials will consist of ground
       and flying training AF Form 4111.
       1.13.4.2. Appropriate aircraft flight manuals. Vendor supplied manuals are sufficient
       providing that they are printed in English and are determined by the initial cadre to be
       accurate.
       1.13.4.3. Appropriate aircraft checklists that cover the spectrum of anticipated
       employment of the aircraft in question.
       1.13.4.4. Aircraft specific addenda to AFSOCI 11-2NSAvV3, NSAv operations
       Procedures, covering the operation and restrictions for the aircraft.
       1.13.4.5. Aircraft specific tests IAW chapter 2 and chapter 3 of this instruction.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011                                                                     19


       1.13.4.6. This material must be approved by HQ AFSOC/A3 prior to training any
       crewmember other than the initial cadre.
       1.13.4.7. Initial cadre status will expire at the end of the 17th month following the month
       of the first flight in the aircraft that initial cadre status was granted. The initial cadre
       must complete AF Form 8 evaluations IAW applicable 11-2NSAv, Volume 2, or current
       AFSOC guidance prior to that expiration.
1.14. Unit Aircrew Capability. Squadrons will maintain mission ready status on primary
aircrew members. Commanders will train aircrews to meet capabilities specified in unit
Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statements. Supervisory aircrew and staff members
assigned above squadron level, which are in excess of the unit’s mission requirements, will
maintain mission ready, basic mission capable, or basic aircraft qualification status, as required.
Note: To change from BMC to MR status, a crewmember will begin maintaining full MR flying
currency. The unit commander may assign additional training, as desired.
   1.14.1. Commanders will not assign additional duties to first assignment ―pipeline‖ (directly
   out of formal MDS training) crewmembers (officer and enlisted) for their first 6 months in
   the unit. This policy allows pipeline students to learn the weapon system without distraction
   of an additional duty; however, first assignment senior personnel (more than one previous
   flying assignment) may be assigned additional duties.
   1.14.2. Aircrew members will not perform long term duties which detract from the primary
   duties of training for, or performing the unit flying mission.
1.15. Publication Administration. Recommendations for improving the publication are
encouraged. Forward recommendations through appropriate channels using AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication.

                                            Chapter 2

                                QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. Overview. This chapter outlines the minimum requirements for basic aircraft qualification
training which may be completed via initial qualification, requalification, conversion, or
differences training. Duties not directly related to qualification or requalification training should
be minimized. The squadron commander will determine which crewmembers will obtain and
maintain currency in specific aircraft. Commanders will ensure aircrew members completing
qualification training meet the requirements of this chapter.
   2.1.1. Basic qualification training (BQT) in each specific aircraft is completed via the NSAv
   initial qualification training (IQT) SOI approved by AFSOC/A3TA.                    Individuals
   transitioning from other aircraft, or requalifying per requirements of section 4.4.6., must
   complete the full aircraft specific IQT course (proficiency advance is encouraged).
   2.1.2. Qualification training provides the training necessary to initially qualify crewmembers
   in a basic crew position and flying duties without regard to the unit’s mission. Upon
   completion of qualification training, the crewmember attains BAQ status. BAQ is typically a
   prerequisite for mission qualification training (MQT), but crewmembers enrolled in an
   aircraft specific IQT course may proceed to the mission phase of training before completing
   BAQ requisites (IAW the approved syllabus course flow).
2.2. General Requirements. The primary method of initial qualification and requalification
training is the appropriate formal training course. If no requalification course exists, conduct
requalification using the initial qualification course. Completing the appropriate formal course
satisfies the training requirements of this chapter. When attendance is not practical or quotas are
not available, units may request secondary method in-unit qualification training waivers IAW
paragraph 1.4.
   2.2.1. Crew Position Requirements. Crewmembers will be trained to meet the crew
   requirements listed in the AOM/POH/AFM/AFSOCI/AFI.                    Typically, crewmembers
   completing their initial qualification in NSAv aircraft will be trained and evaluated as NSAv
   mission crewmembers. Unit commanders and Group commanders can approve pilots to be
   certified as aircraft commanders based upon prior aircraft/MDS qualifications, experience,
   performance, and judgment. Upon unit commander approval, individuals may be qualified
   as instructors if they meet the previous experience requirements of paragraph 5.3. Previously
   qualified NSAv crewmembers may re-qualify directly to their previously held crew position.
   Crewmembers qualifying directly to IP must receive training in both seats before
   certification. The required MDS PAA time may be waived up to 50% by the OG/CC if the
   transition is within NSAv airframes.
2.3. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate formal course SOI,
AFI 11-202V1, AFSOC Sup 1, and this instruction. The (SOI) designates the course prerequisite
approval authority.
2.4. Ground Training Requirements. Crewmembers must complete ground training
requirements IAW Basic Aircraft Qualification Ground Training Requirements table appropriate
for their aircraft as modified by RTM prior to the first training flight in the specified aircraft.
See aircraft specific attachment Table AX .2.1 for Basic Aircraft Qualification Ground Training
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011                                                                    21


Requirements(i.e., Table A3.2.1. for PC-12, A4.2.1. for M-28, etc.). Event [G002] is not
required for flight surgeon, medical technician, or combat camera aerial photographers. See AFI
11-202V1, AFSOC Sup 1., for flight surgeon, medical technician, and combat camera aerial
photographer training requirements.
   2.4.1. Written Examination. Open and closed book qualification examinations for each
   specific aircraft must be completed before the completion of basic qualification flying
   training. Written examinations must satisfy the requirements of AFI 11-202V2, AFSOC Sup
   1, and AFSOCI 11-2NSAvV2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program. The formal
   school will not forward their examinations as part of the courseware for in-unit
   qualifications. When qualification training is completed by secondary method, the student
   will complete the appropriate group stan/eval or equivalent examination IAW AFI 11-202V2,
   AFSOC Sup 1, Para 5.2.7.
   2.4.2. Familiarization in lieu of Qualification. In specific cases where NSAv instructor
   aircrew members operate similar systems/equipment in their primary or additional aircraft,
   HQ AFSOC/A3T with concurrence of HQ AFSOC/A3V may waive requirements for aircraft
   qualification and authorize familiarization and egress training in lieu of qualification in the
   additional aircraft. This training will be documented in the members training folder and AF
   Form 1381, USAF Certification of Aircrew Training.
   2.4.3. NSAv Aircraft Prerequisite Training.
       2.4.3.1. Pilatus PC-12 Training Course (initial) [G045]. All pilots must complete the
       HQ AFSOC/A3T approved PC-12 training course (Series 9, 10 or suitable alternate
       approved by HQ AFSOC/A3T) prior to their first flight. This course is designed to
       provide a baseline of knowledge on aircraft systems and performance before
       commencing formal USAF flight training.
       2.4.3.2. Dornier Do328 Training Course (initial) [G042]. All pilots must complete the
       HQ AFSOC/A3T approved Do328 training course (or suitable alternate approved by HQ
       AFSOC/A3T) prior to their first flight. This course is designed to provide a baseline of
       knowledge on aircraft systems and performance before commencing formal USAF flight
       training.
       2.4.3.3. Bombardier Q200 Training Course (initial) [G043]. All pilots must complete
       the HQ AFSOC/A3T approved Q200 training course (or suitable alternate approved by
       HQ AFSOC/A3T) prior to their first flight. This course is designed to provide a baseline
       of knowledge on aircraft systems and performance before commencing formal USAF
       flight training.
2.5. Flying Training Requirements. Satisfactorily completing the appropriate formal course
satisfies the requirements of this section. Approved in-unit qualification training must be
accomplished IAW applicable formal school courseware and the guidance below:
   2.5.1. Flying training lessons should be completed sequentially. If mission scheduling or
   student progress dictates otherwise, in-unit training sequences may be changed by the unit
   Operations Officer.
2.6. Basic Aircraft Qualification Conversion/Differences Training. Conversion training is
normally associated with training between MDS (e.g., M-28 to Do 328). Difference training is
 22                                                        AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011


conducted when training in a different series aircraft in the same mission design (e.g., M-28
Block 0 (zero) to M-28 Block 10 (ten)). Use difference training when changing between same
design aircraft and the amount of training needed for qualification does not warrant attendance at
a formal qualification course. Additionally, accomplish difference training when an aircraft is
modified and any required training for that modification can easily be accomplished in-unit.
BAQ difference training qualifies an aircrew member to be a basic crewmember. Primary
method for differences training is via completion of a formal school transition course (TX). If a
TX course is not available, the alternate method is via in unit ground and flight training IAW HQ
AFSOC/A3T approved AF Form 4111, satisfactory completion of the qualification written
open/closed examinations, and instructor certification on the AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381
for the new aircraft. Aircrew members entered into differences training will complete training
within 180 days after the first flight of the training program.
   2.6.1. Difference training is required when being certified in an aircraft which is a different
   series, but the same mission and design. For the purposes of basic qualification training, the
   Series 10 and 11 PC-12 are considered the same MDS and difference training is not required.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011                                                                     23


                                            Chapter 3

                      MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT)

3.1. Overview. This chapter establishes the minimum training requirements for completing
mission qualification and requalification. Aircrew members completing mission qualification or
requalification will meet the requirements of this chapter. Upon completion of mission
qualification training, the crewmember will be assigned either basic mission capable or mission
ready status.
3.2. General Requirements. The primary method of mission qualification or requalification is
to complete the appropriate formal training course. Completing the appropriate formal course
satisfies the training requirements of this chapter. If no requalification course exists, conduct
requalification using the initial mission qualification course. When attendance is not practical or
quotas are not available, units may request waivers to conduct secondary method mission
qualification training IAW paragraph 1.4.1. using formal school courseware. The secondary
method requires use of formal school courseware and a waiver from the appropriate waiver
authority. This courseware establishes the minimum training requirements to meet standards
specified in AFSOCI 11-2NSAvV2. Units may supplement courseware to meet local
requirements. Submit courseware change requests to HQ AFSOC/A3T prior to implementation.
3.3. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate formal course SOI,
AFI 11-202V1, AFSOC Sup 1, and this instruction. The SOI designates the course prerequisite
approval authority.
   3.3.1. This does not preclude simultaneous basic qualification and mission qualification
   training. Simultaneous or concurrent multiple aircraft qualification upgrades will not be
   accomplished.
   3.3.2. If there is not a separate mission requalification course, aircrew members requalifying
   in the unit’s mission will comply with the initial mission qualification course prerequisites.
3.4. Ground Training Requirements. Complete ground training in IAW the appropriate
Mission Qualification Ground Training Requirements Table as part of mission qualification
training or prior to certifying individuals as mission ready. See aircraft specific attachment
Table AX .3.1 as modified by RTM for Qualification Ground Training Requirements(i.e., Table
A3.2.1 for PC-12, A4.2.1 for M-28, etc.). Completion of training will establish due dates for
recurring ground training required in Chapter 4. Credit any training accomplished at a formal
school. Qualified mission ready crewmembers transferred from other units require only unit
specific mission ready training events or events which are due/overdue.
   3.4.1. Academic Training. Complete academic and ground training delineated in
   applicable courseware. If not included in the course syllabus, accomplish the minimum
   requirements listed in AFI 11-202V1, AFSOC Sup 1, seperately.
   3.4.2. Written Examination. Crewmembers must complete a written examination before
   the end of mission qualification flying training. Formal school end of course examinations,
   group stan/eval or equivalent examinations for SMT satisfy this requirement. The formal
   school will not forward their examinations as part of the courseware for inunit qualifications.
 24                                                        AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011


   3.4.3. Events [SS20], [G070], [SS25, 26], [SS27, 28] and [G046] are not required for flight
   surgeon, medical technician, or combat camera aerial photographers. See AFI 11-202V1,
   AFSOC Sup 1 for flight surgeon (FS), medical technician, and combat camera aerial
   photographer training requirements.
3.5. Flying Training Requirements. Satisfactorily completing the formal training course
satifies the requirements of this section. Approved in-unit qualification training must be
accomplished IAW applicable formal school courseware and the guidance below:
   3.5.1. Flying training lessons should be completed sequentially. If mission scheduling or
   student progress dictates otherwise, in-unit training sequences may be changed by the unit
   operations officer.
   3.5.2. There should be minimum time lapse between training missions, and every effort
   should be made to complete mission qualification training requirements within the prescribed
   time period.
   3.5.3. Crewmember requirements may be completed on training or operational missions
   under the supervision of an instructor in the same aircrew position. Comply with restrictions
   in AFSOCI 11-2NSAv, Vol. 3, NSAv Operations Procedures.
3.6. Mission Differences Training. Difference training is required when being certified in an
aircraft which is different in mission design, but the same airframe model. This training will be
performed using the HQ AFSOC/A3T-approved differences training syllabus and courseware
and documented in the individual’s Career Training Folder.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011                                                                    25


                                           Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General Requirements.
   4.1.1. Requirements in this chapter and the RTM satisfy the minimum flying and related
   ground training to maintain currency. Individual proficiency may require a greater number
   of events. Commanders will ensure aircrew members receive sufficient continuation training
   to maintain individual proficiency.
   4.1.2. Training requirements may be completed on any sortie if the accrediting criteria of
   this instruction are met. Sorties and events that are compatible may be credited on the same
   flight. For aircrew maintaining currency in multiple aircraft, with approval from unit
   commander/director of operations, requirements may be divided between those aircraft to
   meet this instruction’s requirements. Each requirement, however, will be accomplished at
   least once in each aircraft if applicable. For example, the requirement for Local Proficiency
   Sorties (LPS) each semiannual period is an LPS requirement in each aircraft. A requirement
   for 12 instrument approaches each period may be divided equally between each aircraft in
   which currency is maintained.
   4.1.3. Aircrew members will not log continuation training requirements in events in which
   they are unqualified.
   4.1.4. Training events accomplished on a evaluation or an instructor certification (that event)
   may be credited toward the individual’s volume requirements.
   4.1.5. Flying training events accomplished during formal training will use the course
   completion date (successful evaluation date) to establish the due dates for subsequent
   currency and requirements. Use actual dates for ground training. Certification events trained
   to a 3C in the FTU will use the date of the checkride as the initial accomplishment date.
   4.1.6. Aircraft flying training requirements may be accomplished in an aircrew training
   device (ATD) as noted in Table AX.4.3 and Table AX.4.4 A simulator event certification
   letter issued by Lead Command/A3T may permit ATD event logging in excess of Table
   AX.4.3 and Table AX.4.4
4.2. Training Levels (TL) The use of experience based FTLs and Ground Training Levels
(GTLs) allows the squadron commander to prioritize training resources. Aircrew members
must meet the minimum criteria established in paragraph 4.2.1. and the Minimum FTL Hour
Requirements Table approporiate to their aircraft as modified by RTM before assignment to the
respective training level. See aircraft specific attachment Table AX .4.1 for Minimum FTL
Hour Requirements(i.e., Table A3.4.1 for PC-12, A4.4.1 for M-28, etc.). When these minima
are met, awarding a training level is at the sole discretion of the squadron commander. Note:
The aircrew member’s availability to fly should not be a factor in assigning a TL.
   4.2.1. FTLs are based on minimum PAA time and total time per the Minimum FTL Hour
   Requirements Table approporiate to their aircraft as modified by RTM. For basic
   qualification FTL, PAA time will include any variant of PC-12 or U-28.
       4.2.1.1. FTL ―A‖-Highly experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members.
 26                                                       AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011


      4.2.1.2. FTL ―B‖-Experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members.
      4.2.1.3. FTL ―C‖-Inexperienced BAQ and MR aircrew members (Pilots not certified as
      aircraft commanders).
   4.2.2. Crewmembers may be assigned different FTLs for basic and mission qualifications
   and individual events. For example, an aircraft commander or loadmaster coming from C-
   130s might be assigned basic FTL ―A‖ with a mission FTL ―C‖.
   4.2.3. Change of FTL. Once a semiannual period begins, personnel will not be moved to a
   level requiring fewer events until the next semiannual period.
   4.2.4. GTLs are based upon operational flying experience.
      4.2.4.1. GTL ―1‖ – Aircrew members with 5 years or greater of operational flying.
      4.2.4.2. GTL ―2‖ – Aircrew members with less than 5 years of operational flying.
4.3. Proration of Training Requirements. See AFI 11-202V1, AFSOC Sup 1.
4.4. Recurrency and Requalification Training. Training is required whenever an aircrew
member does not meet a currency requirement in this instruction. An aircrew member will not
perform events unsupervised until training has been accomplished.
   4.4.1. Loss of Currency. Failure to accomplish events listed in continuation training (Tables
   AX.4.2 through AX4.4) or as outlined in RTM results in a loss of currency for that event.
   Crewmembers are non-current the day after event currency expires.
      4.4.1.1. Loss of currency in any Table AX.4.3 event results in loss of basic aircraft
      currency(Exception is night takeoffs and landings see Table AX.4.3 note 2). These
      individuals will fly under the supervision of an instructor or flight examiner on sorties
      until recurrent. With SQ/CC approval, aircrew who become non-current in their primary
      aircraft while deployed may continue to fly secondary aircraft on that deployment. That
      member will be non-current in all aircraft upon redeployment. Without SQ/CC approval,
      loss of currency in the aircrew member’s primary aircraft causes loss of flight
      authorization in secondary aircraft. Regaining currency in the primary aircraft
      automatically regains flight authorization in secondary aircraft. Loss of currency in
      secondary aircraft does not affect currency in the primary aircraft.
          4.4.1.1.1. If basic semiannual currency is lost (failure to complete the requirements
          of Table AX.4.3), it is lost for aircraft in which a crewmember maintains currency.
          Lost basic semiannual currency may be regained in any aircraft in which a
          crewmember maintains currency.
      4.4.1.2. Loss of currency exceeding 6-months. Crewmembers non-current in designated
      BAQ events (Table AX.4.3 note 1 events) in excess of six months results in loss of BAQ.
      Crewmembers non-current in designated mission events (Table AX.4.4 note 1 events) in
      excess of six months results in loss of mission qualification.
   4.4.2. Regaining Currency.
      4.4.2.1. Only Table AX.4.3 and Table AX.4.4 Note 1 events require an evaluation
      (unqualified) if loss of currency exceeds 6 months (see AFI 11-202V1, AFSOC Sup 1).
      Other events require showing proficiency to an instructor in the aircraft or simulator (per
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011                                                                    27


       simulator event certification letter) to regain currency. If loss of currency exceeds 24
       months in non-Note 1 events, additional training will consist of ground and flight training
       as directed by the unit commander (training folder must be opened).
       4.4.2.2. Aircrew non-current in special mission events which only require an instructor
       certification (Table 5.4) may regain currency by showing proficiency in that event to an
       instructor.
       4.4.2.3. Aircrew non-current more than 24 months in special mission events (Table
       AX.4.4) requiring an evaluation will complete initial training and evaluation
       requirements for that special mission event.
   4.4.3. Requalification Training. Crewmembers requiring requalification will accomplish
   training IAW AFI 11-202V1, AFSOC Sup 1, and chapters 2, 3, and 5 of this instruction.
4.5. Ground Training. Table AX.4.2 designates ground training requirements for aircrew
members. See aircraft specific attachment Table AX .4.2 for NSAv Ground Training
Requirements(i.e., Table A4.4.2 for PC-12, A4.4.2 for M-28, etc.). Crew members will comply
with the time periods listed for their FTL/GTL. Conduct training IAW the referenced
publications, notes in Table AX.4.2, and the guidance below. The governing directive or RTM
takes precedence over chapter 4 requirements. If this instruction is also listed as a governing
directive, the most restrictive guidance should be followed.
   4.5.1. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events.         Make-up training should be
   accomplished at the earliest opportunity. The following apply when crewmembers exceed
   due dates for Table AX.4.2 events.
       4.5.1.1. Grounding items.      Crewmembers will not perform flight duties until the
       grounding item is satisfied.
       4.5.1.2. Training status items. Crewmembers will not fly without instructor supervision.
       4.5.1.3. Mission Ready (MR) items. Failure to accomplish MR events in Table AX.4.2
       results in non-mission ready status and the individual will not deploy as a crewmember.
   4.5.2. Block Training. Each group operations training office should establish and administer
   a centralized aircrew block training session. Block training should include all recurring
   ground training required to maintain readiness.
   4.5.3. Ancillary training. This volume is not a comprehensive list of all ancillary training
   required by the Department of Defense (DOD). Ancillary training parent instructions take
   precedence over this AFSOCI for those training items.

4.7. Basic Aircraft Qualification Event Definitions. The following event definitions apply to
Table AX.4.3 Failure to accomplish currency or volume requirements results in loss of basic
aircraft currency.
   4.7.1. Aircrew Proficiency Sortie (APS) [ST14].
An aircrew proficiency sortie may be logged for an individual who is flying in a primary crew
position and meets the following position specific criteria:
       4.7.1.1. Pilots must accomplish at least three events from Table AX.4.3 to log an APS.
       Pilots may log more than one APS on multi leg missions if at least three events were
       accomplished on each leg/APS to include a full stop landing.
       4.7.1.2. Loadmasters must perform normal crew duties during a sortie to include a
       takeoff and landing. Loadmasters may log an APS on any sortie carrying cargo or
       passengers. Loadmasters may log more than one APS on multi leg missions if cargo or
       passengers are carried on each leg.
   4.7.2. Local Proficiency Sortie (LPS). To log an LPS, a pilot must accomplish at least one
   hour of primary or instructor time practicing instrument, transition, and emergency
   procedures. A pilot must fly maneuvers under the supervision of an IP and repeat them until
   an acceptable level of proficiency is attained or the LPS may not be credited. If the LPS is
   incomplete, the instructor will recommend whether the entire LPS or just the incomplete
   events must be re-accomplished. Instructors and flight examiners need not complete all LPS
   events on a single sortie. Credit an LPS when all events are complete. Instructor pilots are
   not required to fly with another IP to credit this event. Unit commanders may add to the
   following minimum LPS sortie criteria:
       4.7.2.1. A review of boldface/critical action procedures.
       4.7.2.2. Two instrument approaches, one of which should be a RNAV (GPS) approach.

                          UPGRADE/SPECIALIZED TRAINING

5.1. General. This chapter identifies the prerequisites and training requirements for qualified
aircrew members upgrading to additional levels of qualification and certification in specialized
flight events.
5.2. Aircraft Commander Certification. See current MAJCOM RTM for Table AX .5.1
Minimum Hours Required to Certify for Initial Aircraft Commander(i.e., Table A3.5.1 for PC-
12, A4.5.1 for M-28, etc.).
   5.2.1. NSAv Aircraft Commander Certification. Since the NSAv formal pilot qualification
   course teaches to aircraft commander standards, any pilot who has previously held an aircraft
   commander rating in another MDS and has completed a NSAv aircraft specific formal pilot
   qualification program is eligible to be certified as an aircraft commander. Each aircraft
   commander certification will be documented on an AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381.
5.3. Instructor Upgrade. A sound and practical aircrew instructor program is a prerequisite for
effective training, standardization, and aircraft mishap prevention.
   5.3.1. Unit commanders will personally review each instructor candidate’s qualifications and
   select instructors based on their background, experience, maturity, and ability to instruct.
   The following characteristics must be considered:
       5.3.1.1. Instructional Ability.   An instructor is a teacher and must understand the
       principles of instruction.
       5.3.1.2. Judgment. Instructors must possess judgment necessary to meet unexpected or
       induced emergencies, and the ability to exercise sound judgment through mature
       realization of their own, their student’s, and the aircraft’s limitations.
       5.3.1.3. Personal Qualities. The instructor must have patience, tact, understanding, and
       the desire to instruct others. Instructors must have a personality which inspires and wins
       respect of each student.
       5.3.1.4. Technical Knowledge. The instructor must be thoroughly familiar with
       respective aircraft systems and equipment, normal and emergency operating procedures,
       and the prohibited maneuvers and aircraft performance under all conditions of flight.
       Additionally, instructors must be thoroughly familiar with aviation management, flying
       training, and flying operations publications.
       5.3.1.5. Flying Experience. Instructors must possess reasonable flying experience to
       include desired standards of skill and proficiency in both the aircraft and assigned
       missions. Flying hours alone cannot be accepted as criteria for selection to instructor.
       5.3.1.6. Tactical Experience. The instructor must be familiar with how their MDS can be
       employed in threat areas. They must be familiar with applicable Air Force Tactics,
       Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) volumes.
   5.3.2. Initial Candidates. Initial instructor upgrade candidates must be mission ready in their
   unit’s mission for a minimum of 6 months

       5.3.2.1. Instructor candidates must meet Table AX.5.2 requirements. See current
       MAJCOM RTM Table AX .5.2 for Minimum Hours Required to Upgrade to
       Instructor(i.e., Table A3.5.2 for PC-12, A4.5.2 for M-28, etc.).
           5.3.2.1.1. Loadmasters must have at least one year of flying experience in AFSOC
           aircraft and should be a 5-level Loadmaster primary AFSC in order to be considered
           for instructor upgrade.
   5.3.3. Ground and Flight Training Requirements. Before being designated an instructor,
   candidates will demonstrate to a flight examiner their ability to instruct and perform selected
   maneuvers and items according to applicable directives. In addition, candidates will adhere
   to the following:
       5.3.3.1. Qualify in the applicable formal school instructor course for their crew position
       IAW the ETCA. If no formal school instructor course exists, conduct ground and flying
       training IAW the applicable MAJCOM syllabus/AF Form 4111. First time instructors
       must complete academic instructor training course (AITC) or equivalent.
       5.3.3.2. BAQ instructors may keep that status during mission qualification. Prior to
       instructing mission events, they must finish MQT and complete an instructor flight
       evaluation on a tactical mission.
   5.3.4. Instructor Requalification.    See AFI 11-202V1, AFSOC Sup 1 and applicable
   MAJCOM supplement.

   supplement.
   5.3.6. Crewmembers Previously Qualified as USAF Aircrew Instructors. See AFI 11-
   202V1, AFSOC Sup 1. With OG/CC approval, these crewmembers may upgrade in-unit
   without a secondary method training waiver. OG/CCs should take into consideration the
   previously qualified instructors’ experience with AFSOC roles, missions and combat
   experience. They must meet requirements of paragraph 5.3.2.
5.4. Flight Examiner Upgrade. Flight examiners are selected from the most qualified and
competent instructors. Before being designated as a flight examiner, candidates will demonstrate
satisfactory knowledge of command training and evaluation policies and procedures. In
addition, they will demonstrate the ability to administer an evaluation IAW AFSOCI 11-
2NSAvV2. Conduct initial training IAW MAJCOM approved AF Form 4111. Certification will
be annotated on AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381.
5.5. Special Mission Qualifications and Certifications. The commander will select aircrew
members qualified in the unit’s mission to maintain additional special qualifications and
certifications. A flight evaluation is required for special mission qualifications, while
Certifications are gained IAW paragraph 5.6. Special mission events are not considered core
mission events and are not required for mission ready status. Instructors are authorized to teach
any special qualifications in which they are qualified and current unless specifically restricted.
5.6. Instructor Certified Events. Events which require instructor certification on the AF Form
4348 or AF Form 1381 and the crew positions that require certification are listed below. These
events may be taught at the formal school as part of mission qualification training. Formal
school instructors will make AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381 entries for training completed
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011                                                                 39

certified and current unless specifically restricted. Complete training IAW MAJCOM approved
AF Form 4111 and the guidance below:
   5.6.1. Functional Check Flight (FCF) Program. Units may use the formal training FCF
   course when available. Training may be conducted in unit, without a waiver, using the
   MAJCOM approved AF Form 4111. After instructor certification on the AF Form 4348 or
   AF Form 1381, maintain currency IAW MAJCOM policy. Training will require an initial
   ground and flight phase. A written test will be required every 12 months. It should ensure
   familiarization with appropriate technical orders, instructions, and maintenance manuals.
   Training will also emphasize proper accomplishment of ground and in-flight maneuvers in
   accordance with aircraft manuals and AFSOC-approved courseware. Completion of training
   will be documented on a letter furnished to QA and an entry will be made on the individual’s
   AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381. OG/CC will appoint an FCF OIC IAW AFI 21-101,
   Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management. Additionally, the unit commander will
   appoint an FCF monitor to manage the certification of other crewmembers. This individual
   will be a rated FCF pilot. Reference AFI 11-202V3, and T.O. 1-1-300, for further guidance.

                                            Chapter 6

                             AIRCREW TRAINING RECORDS

6.1. General. This chapter provides guidelines on proper training documentation. Instructions
are provided for AF Form 4109, Aircrew Training Folder, AF Form 4110, Comments-
CSAR/Special Operations Training Record, and AF Form 4111, CSAR/Special Operations
Training. MAJCOM approved substitute may be utilized in lieu of these forms.
6.2. Career Training Folder. Units will maintain a career training folder for assigned or
attached crewmembers. Completed training records will be included in a single binder of
appropriate size to provide an accurate representation of an individual’s long term progression
and any positive or negative trends related to their training.
   6.2.1. The name of the crewmember will be clearly posted on both the binder spine and front
   cover. The front cover must also prominently display the following statement: ―PRIVACY
   ACT INFORMATION - The information accessed through this system is FOR OFFICIAL
   USE ONLY and must be protected in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 and AFI 33-
   332, Privacy Act Program.‖ Each training record within the binder will be tabbed separately
   to differentiate between programs. The binder will be divided into sections as follows:
       6.2.1.1. Section 1 - Table of Contents. This should clearly list each item contained
       within the binder and the tab where it is located. It should be kept as current and accurate
       as possible and clearly display the date of the last update.
       6.2.1.2. Section 2 - Record of Review. The training section will review the career
       training folder for accuracy and completeness annually. Annotate the date of review as
       well as the name and office symbol of the reviewing official. Include any comments or
       discrepancies noted. If an expanded explanation is necessary, use an MFR signed by the
       unit training officer. File these documents behind the record of annual review in
       chronological order with the most recent on the bottom. No annual review is required for
       crewmembers in inactive/non-flying positions. Annotate the timeframe during which the
       individual was in non-flying status in appropriate chronological space in the record of
       annual review (i.e., Feb 2010-Jun2010 Inactive/AFSOC staff).
       6.2.1.3. Section 3 - Completed Training Records. This section will ideally contain all
       flight training records (qualifications, certifications, specialized mission training, etc.),
       whether they are completed in-unit or at the FTU. The records will be in chronological
       order starting with initial qualification and ending with the most recently completed
       training on the bottom. Each training record within the folder will be tabbed separately to
       differentiate between programs. The tabs will be numbered in order with the member’s
       initial qualification (whether completed at the FTU or in-unit) labeled Tab #1. During
       inspections, permanent training folders may be reviewed to ensure compliance with this
       chapter. Individual training records contained within section three of the permanent
       training folder will not be open to inspection during these visits.
   6.2.2. Career training folders are covered by the Privacy Act of 1974 and shall be used for
   official business only. Maintain folders in a secure area within the unit’s training section.
   Only instructors and supervisors should have regular access to these records. Individuals
   may sign out their own records.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011                                                                       41


   6.2.3. When a crewmember makes a PCS move, the squadron training section will copy the
   table of contents and record of annual review as a minimum. The unit shall seal the career
   training folder in an envelope along with the individual’s FEF and give it to the member for
   delivery to the next duty station.
       6.2.3.1. Crewmembers PCS to an active flying assignment. The losing unit squadron
       training section will keep these documents for six months from the date the individual
       departs home station, in the event records are lost or destroyed en route.
       6.2.3.2. Crewmembers PCS to an in-active flying assignment, separating or retiring. The
       losing unit squadron training section shall keep these copies until the member arrives at
       his next flying assignment or five years (whichever is less).
6.3. Entry into Upgrade. Initiate a training folder (AF Form 4109) for formal training courses
(formal school or in-unit), mission certification, special qualification, certification training, in-
unit upgrade program to the next higher crew qualification, requalification training (formal
school or in-unit), and corrective action or additional training. Each training folder must include
documentation of entry into the training program by the unit leadership. This will normally
consist of an entry on the first AF Form 4110 in the trainee’s record. Units may also substitute a
copy of the minutes from an upgrade board, MFR, or other locally produced form in place of the
AF Form 4110 entry. This document must be signed by the unit operations officer or
commander.
6.4. AF Form 4109. This form is the cardstock folder used to hold required training documents.
It is available from the pubs distribution office or by establishing an account on the AF e-
publishing homepage. It is mandatory for basic/mission qualification training and any special
mission qualification training (leading to either a special mission evaluation or instructor
certification). Some locally developed syllabi/courseware may be approved by HQ AFSOC/A3T
for implementation without the AF Form 4109 on a case-by-case basis. An AF Form 4109 is
also required for corrective action as a result of an evaluation (other than end-of-course
evaluations). This requirement may be waived by the unit operations officer if corrective action
is limited and would not warrant the initiation of a training folder. The flight examiner who
directed the additional training will annotate training deficiencies on the AF Form 4110.
"Active" AF Form 4109 records will be maintained in a location readily accessible to
instructors/trainers, supervisory personnel, and the individual aircrew member. Comply with the
following instructions when completing the AF Form 4109.
   6.4.1. Ground Training Summary (top inside left). This is a chronological record of ground
   training events. Entries are required for any part task trainer (PTT), Cockpit Procedures
   Trainer (CPT), simulator(SIM) training, or ground training (GT). Entries are not required for
   formal academic (classroom) instruction conducted per formal school courseware.
       6.4.1.1. Date. Self-explanatory.
       6.4.1.2. Training Period. Enter sequential training period designators (e.g., PTT-1, CPT-
       3, etc.)
       6.4.1.3. Status. Enter "C" if training is completed. Otherwise, enter incomplete (I) and

       6.4.6.2. Additional Codes. Use these codes on preprinted AF Form 4111 as indicated.
       6.4.6.3. Training Period Designators. Use the following codes to describe flight training
       periods: T-Transition, I-Instrument, M-Mission, EV-Evaluation, N-Night, or as dictated
       by syllabus. FTUs may use more descriptive designators, if required.
       6.4.6.4. Remarks. This section may be used for additional information at unit discretion.
       Otherwise, it should be left blank.
6.5. AF Form 4110. Use this form to record a narrative of student performance during flying
and ground training sessions and administrative comments related to student training. It is
available through AF e-publishing. This form is required for formal training completed at the
FTU or in-unit. The form shall be maintained on the left side of the AF Form 4109. Comply
with the following instructions when completing the AF Form 4110.
   6.5.1. Name or Trainee Name. Self-explanatory.

   pertinent to the individual’s training (e.g., recommendations for proficiency advance,
 44                                                         AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011


   monthly/quarterly reviews, etc.). Write-ups for student flying training events should comply
   with the following format:
       6.5.4.1. Profile. This section should start by listing the sortie or event completed or
       indicate why the sortie was incomplete if it was not finished for any reason and what
       items yet remain to complete it. A brief description of weather and other related factors
       (e.g., illumination levels for an NVG sortie) should be the next item. The rest of the
       section should be a brief summary of training completed, to include specific events and
       number of iterations where relevant. The write-up should leave the next instructor no
       doubts as to where to pick up training. Enter detailed comments whenever the
       performance level attained is below the printed RPL.
       6.5.4.2. Strengths. This section should be a brief summary of the student’s strengths.
       Make every effort to identify useable, relevant strengths to further build a picture of
       student progression for the next instructor. There should always be some strength or
       strengths to emphasize but if the sortie does not lend itself to identifying any or none are
       honestly noted, state ―none noted.‖ If no strengths are noted, strong consideration should
       be given to awarding the student an ―unsatisfactory‖ for the training period.
       6.5.4.3. Weaknesses. This section should be a brief summary of the student’s
       weaknesses. It should, again, contribute to the next instructor’s ability to understand the
       proficiency level the student has attained. It should also give the student areas in which
       to strive for improvement. An honest assessment is critical but avoid being overly harsh
       or judgmental. There should always be some weakness or weaknesses to emphasize but
       if the sortie does not lend itself to identifying any or none are honestly noted, state ―none
       noted.‖ If no weaknesses are noted, strong consideration should be given to awarding the
       student an ―excellent‖ for the training period.
       6.5.4.4. Recommendations. Write primarily for the next instructor but also include
       recommendations for the student where applicable. List items the next trainer should
       emphasize or other suggestions to maximize the student’s next training event. Enter the
       next recommended step for the student (i.e., continue with training, proceed to
       evaluation, proficiency advance, etc.).
       6.5.4.5. The individual making the entry will sign after each write-up, and print his/her
       name and crew/supervisory position. The student will initial next to the trainer’s
       signature. This only indicates that he/she has read and understands the entry. It does not
       necessarily indicate agreement/concurrence.
6.6. AF Form 4111. Use this form to document required maneuver item file (MIF) and RPL.
Typically, this will be a pre-printed form provided by the FTU. Locally developed overprints
may be used when formal courseware is not available. These must be approved by HQ
AFSOC/A3T prior to use. Approved AF Form 4111 overprints may be posted on the HQ
AFSOC/A3TA website. Comply with the following instructions when completing the AF Form
4111.
   6.6.1. Name. Self explanatory.
   6.6.2. Crew Position. For aircrew members in a program designed to advance them to a
   higher crew position, enter the qualification to which they are upgrading. For other training,
   enter the crew position currently held.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011                                                                      45


   6.6.3. Course/Phase. Enter formal course title, if one exists, or enter a descriptive identifier
   for other types of training.
   6.6.4. Programmed Training Profile. This line should contain the sortie identifiers for each
   training event and the syllabus-directed training time.
   6.6.5. Actual Training Profile. The instructor should log the actual training time the student
   received.
   6.6.6. ID. Leave blank.
   6.6.7. Task/Topic Listing. List each MIF item number from the syllabus (if applicable) and
   a description of the task required (i.e., safety/judgment, lead/wing responsibilities, etc.) on a
   separate line.
   6.6.8. Min Event. List the minimum number of events needed to complete training (if
   applicable).
   6.6.9. GR/PK. List the performance (P) and knowledge (K) grade attained on that sortie.
   On a preprinted form, the instructor should slash through the item if the RPL is met. If the
   RPL is not met, or is exceeded, write the actual RPL attained over the preprinted
   number/letter. Award grades IAW procedures listed on the back cover of the AF Form 4109.
   6.6.10. Required Proficiency Level. This is the final RPL the student must attain for the
   maneuver prior to recommendation for evaluation or certification. One RPL should be listed
   for each MIF item or training event.
6.7. Periodic Reviews. Operations officers will review active training folders quarterly, and
squadron training representatives will conduct a monthly review (quarterly for ARC units).
Annotate monthly and quarterly reviews with a signed entry on AF Form 4110 or on a unit
developed form placed on the top left of the training folder. In those months where a quarterly
review is completed, the monthly review is not required.
   6.7.1. At the monthly review, check that training is correctly documented and instructor
   writeups adequately document student performance. If errors are discovered, take immediate
   action to correct them or document reasons the errors could not be corrected (i.e., instructor
   not available for signature). Note: Whether the trainee is progressing in a satisfactory
   manner, identify any significant problems encountered, and recommend any adjustments to
   training. Review the time elapsed between training flights. If an excessive amount of time
   has elapsed between training rides, document the reasons (N/A ANG).
   6.7.2. The quarterly review should focus on trainee progression. The operations officer
   should take this time to determine if students are performing up to standards and the training
   program is meeting his goals or vision for the unit. Document any relevant findings and
   direct any changes to the training program.
6.8. Instructions for Closing Out Training Records. Close out the training record with a final
entry on the AF Form 4110, whether a training program is successfully completed or terminated
for other reasons (failure to progress, extended DNIF, etc). Both the unit training officer and the
unit ops officer must sign this entry. Units may substitute an MFR, or other locally produced
form, in place of the AF Form 4110 entry. This document must be signed by the unit training
officer and operations officer.
 46                                                       AFSOCI11-2NSAvV1 3 MAY 2011


   6.8.1. For successful completion of training, indicate that training has been satisfactorily
   completed, the new qualification or certification is awarded, and records have been updated
   (to include the AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381, letter of Xs, FEF, and ARMS database as
   required). Also, include any restrictions (if applicable).
   6.8.2. For termination of training (for cause or unrelated factors), indicate the reasons for
   termination of the upgrade and plans to re-enter the trainee into the program again at a later
   date (if any).
6.9. Instructions for Documenting Aircrew Qualifications. Units must accurately track all
qualifications and certifications for each crewmember. This is best accomplished through a
combination of the AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381, a locally-generated letter of Xs (or
equivalent), and the AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification Worksheet.
   6.9.1. AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381. Maintain the AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381 in
   the member’s flight evaluation folder IAW AFSOCI 11-2NSAv, Vol. 2. Events requiring
   documentation on the AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381 are listed in Table 5.4 of this
   instruction.
   6.9.2. Letter of Xs. A letter of Xs is the commander’s tool to track specialized training not
   appropriate for the AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381 (i.e., locally required certifications, and
   training in new equipment or procedures). Specific procedures and format may be
   determined locally, but it must contain the following minimum information: crewmember
   name, highest qualification currently held, and any specialized training completed (not
   documented elsewhere). Include any other information required by the unit commander.
   6.9.3. AF Form 4324. This form is the source document used to update aircrew certification,
   assign training profiles, and formal flying training dates in ARMS. The squadron Stan/Eval
   or training office will complete this form and submit to SARM personnel to assign training
   profiles when a new crewmember in-processes to the unit. Complete a new form when
   training profiles are added, aircrew certification codes change, and when formal school
   courses are completed.

Conversion training requires completion of a formal school initial qualification course.
Core Mission Events—A crewmember must be qualified in all core mission events to be
considered Mission Ready (MR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC). Loss of qualification
(noncurrent greater than 6 months) in any core mission event results in loss of overall mission
qualification.

Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI)—Aircraft assigned to a unit for performance of
its wartime mission. PMAI forms the basis for the allocation of operating resources to include
manpower, support equipment, and funding of flying hours.
Total Flying Time—Total time for all aircraft flown in military service to include student time.
Time accumulated must be in the aircrew member's current rating (i.e., pilot, navigator, etc.).
Training Status—A deficient status in which a crewmember must fly under the supervision of
an instructor when occupying a primary crew position. Once deficient items are corrected, the
crewmember is removed from training status.
Volume—For the purposes of this instruction, volume refers to the number of events an aircrew
member must accomplish in a given period of time (i.e., quarterly or semiannually).
