   24.4. If the Control Tower deems that a runway/taxiway check is required, Airfield
   Management shall be notified as soon as possible. The Control Tower shall coordinate with
   Airfield Management when suspending aircraft operations in the affected area until Airfield
   Management completes the check. If normal operations cannot be immediately resumed
   following the check, Airfield Management shall close the affected area and issue a NOTAM,
   as appropriate.
   24.5. Airfield Management shall perform a runway FOD check after the first touch-and-go
   landing or full stop landing (whichever comes first) for any returning sorties that attempted
   release of any external lanyard-type weapons IAW AFI 11-2B-52, Vol 3_5 BWSUP1,
   B-52—Operations Procedures. Wing Scheduling shall annotate the local flying schedule
   with “Runway Check Required” for all sorties requiring a runway check upon recovery.
25. Noise Abatement Procedures
   25.1. Aircraft shall not operate over the Minot AFB housing area. There are no nighttime
   restrictions for noise abatement at Minot AFB.
   25.2. Ceremonial Quiet Hour Requests
       25.2.1. The term “quiet hours” is used to denote a period of reduced aircraft noise levels
       at Minot AFB. Operations permitted during quiet hours are dependent on the type of
       ceremony being conducted.
       25.2.2. When directed by 5 OG/CC, the Control Tower shall minimize aircraft
       movement within the confines of the base.
 18                                                   MINOTAFBI11-250 14 JANUARY 2014


       25.2.3. Requests for quiet hours shall be forwarded to the Airfield Operations Flight
       Commander no later than 10 days prior to the requested date. The Airfield Operations
       Flight Commander shall coordinate with the 5 OSS/CC, 91 OG/CC and 5 OG/CC as
       needed. The Quiet Hours request form can be found in Attachment 2. Factors to
       consider include the proximity of the movement to the event, the type of movement and
       aircraft involved, and whether the event is indoors or outdoors. Requestors should expect
       a 15-minute buffer to be added to both the beginning and end of their request.
       25.2.4. The following denotes the quiet hour categories:
           25.2.4.1. Category 1: Operations are suspended; aircraft and helicopters cannot take-
           off, land, taxi, perform engine starts, engine test operations, ground equipment (AGE)
           test operations or to be towed; restrictions also include: towing support equipment, air
           munitions or fuel truck operations.
           25.2.4.2. Category 2: Aircraft test, AGE or engine test operations not to exceed “idle
           power” are authorized; all aircraft take-offs, landings, and taxi operations are
           prohibited.
           25.2.4.3. Category 3: Routine support aircraft operations are in effect. Aircraft take-
           offs are suspended; aircraft returning to Minot will be required to recover from a
           straight-in approach to “full stop landing” only. Over-flights and practice approaches
           are prohibited.
   25.3. During Designated Quiet Hours
       25.3.1. As a general policy, ATC shall terminate/deny all departures and practice
       approaches, disapprove all aircraft requests for taxi clearance, and deny requests for
       engine runs based upon the quiet hour category requested. 54 HS helicopters are able to
       depart if responding to: security situation, PL-1 convoy or SAR/MEDEVAC.
       25.3.2. Airfield Management and CE shall determine on a case-by-case basis if breaks in
       airfield construction are necessary, based on the noise level of the construction being
       accomplished and the location relative to the quiet hours event.
       25.3.3. The event POC shall call the Airfield Operations Flight Commander immediately
       after the conclusion of the event in order for Airfield Management to cancel local
       NOTAMs and resume operations. Only the 5 BW/CC, 5 OG/CC, 5 OSS/CC, or
       5OSS/DO can terminate quiet hours.
       25.3.4. Airfield Management shall issue a local NOTAM describing quiet hours
       including limited restrictions.
26. Restricted/Classified Areas on the Airfield: The red lines on aircraft parking ramps
indicate restricted areas. These areas are considered active when aircraft are parked within the
confines of the marked restricted area. Entry into restricted/classified areas is only authorized
via designated Entry Control Points (ECPs) and with appropriate restricted area badges. The
Mass Parking Area (MPA), Alternate Parking Area (APA) and Overflow Parking Area (OPA)
have Entry Control Points (ECPs).
27. Procedures for Suspending Runway Operations: Airfield Management or Tower may
suspend runway operations when any unsafe runway conditions are observed or reported.
MINOTAFBI11-250 14 JANUARY 2014                                                                 19


Note: Only Airfield Management personnel can resume runway operations following a
suspension, once they have physically checked the area. The OG/CC or representitive (SOF)
may wave this check with the understanding that they are accepting responsibility for the safety
of the landing surface.
28. Procedures for Opening/Closing the Runway: Airfield closures and restrictions shall be
processed IAW AFI 13-204V3. Procedures for opening or closing the runway shall be IAW
local checklists outlined in the Airfield Management Operating Instruction (AMOI) and Air
Traffic Control Operating Instrucion (ATC OI). Airfield Management is the only agency that
can open or close an airfield. For the airfield to be considered open, both Airfield Management
and the Control Tower must be on duty.
   28.1. For operations outside of published FLIP operating hours, the airfield will open 1 hour
   prior to the first takeoff or 1 hour prior to an arrival.
   28.2. The airfield will remain open 30 minutes after the last takeoff when operating outside
   of normal hours. In the event of a recall, both facilities shall be operational within 1 hour of
   notification.
29. Protection Precision Approach Critical Areas: Criteria outlined in AFI 13-204, V3, and
FAAO 7110.65 shall be used to protect the precision approach critical areas identified below.
   29.1. Glide Slope and Localizer Precision Approach Critical Areas: Instrument hold
   lines are designated on Taxiways Alpha and Juliet to protect the Runway 29 glide slope
   critical area and Runway 11 localizer critical areas. See Figure 3 and 4.
   29.2. Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ): The POFZ is an 800 feet wide by 200 feet
   long rectangular area centered on the runway centerline, beginning at and extending outward
   from the threshold, designed to protect aircraft flying precision approaches from ground
   vehicles and other aircraft when the ceiling is less than 300 feet, or visibility is less than ¾
   statute mile (or runway visual range below 4,000 feet). See Figure 3 and 4.
30. Civil Aircraft Operations
   30.1. Civil aircraft operating at USAF airfields must comply with procedures in AFI 10-
   1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, AFI 10-1002, Agreements for Civil Aircraft Use of Air
   Force Airfields, and AFI 10-1003, Use of Air Force Installations for Non-Government
   Business by Civil Air Carriers Participating in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) Program.
   30.2. Civil aircraft are authorized to conduct practice approaches at Minot AFB, provided
   there is no delay to military aircraft. IAW AFI 10-1001, Air Force airfields are available for
   use by civil aircraft so far as such use does not interfere with military operations or
   jeopardize the military utility of the installation. Access will be granted on an equitable
   basis. Air Force requirements take precedence over authorized civil aircraft use. This
   instruction carries the force of US law, and exceptions are not authorized without prior
   approval from the Civil Aviation Branch, Bases and Units Division, Directorate of
   Operations, (HQ USAF/XOOBC), 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1480.
   Proposed exceptions or waivers are evaluated as to current and future impact on Air Force
   policy and operations.

   30.3. Civil Use of Military NAVAIDS/Air Traffic Control Landing Systems
   (ATCALS): There are no NAVAIDS on Minot Airfield that are part of the National
   Airspace System.
31. Airspace Letters of Agreement/Letters of Procedure/Operations Letters Airspace and
Controlling Agencies: All Letters of Agreement, Letters of Procedure and Ops Letters that
pertain to airspace, ATC or airfield operations procedures will be kept on file in the Airfield Ops
file plan and library in Airfield Management. These will be reviewed annually with applicable
base agencies IAW AFI directives. ATC at MAFB is provided by the following agencies:
   31.1. Minneapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC): IFR traffic above flight level
   (FL) 230.
   31.2. RADAR Approach Control service is provided by Minot Approach; Minneapolis
   ARTCC delegates Minot Approach responsibility for the control of IFR/VFR/special VFR
   (SVFR) aircraft operating at or below FL 230 and within the lateral limits of points “Alpha”
   through “Foxtrot.”

Figure 9. Minot Approach Airspace

Section B—VFR Procedures

32. VFR Weather Minima: VFR weather minimums in the MAFB local flying area are IAW
AFI 11-202, Vol 3. To conduct VFR flight, the reported weather must be at least a 1,500’ AGL
ceiling and 3 statute miles (SM) visibility for fixed wing aircraft. For helicopters to conduct
VFR flight, the reported weather must be at least a 1,000’ AGL ceiling and 3 statute miles (SM)
visibility.
   32.1. Aircraft requesting to depart VFR shall notify the Control Tower on initial contact with
   the intended direction of flight and if radar flight following is desired.
33. Simulated Flame Out Procedures: Simulated flameout approaches and other practice
precautionary approaches are not authorized at Minot AFB. Any aircraft, however, may make
precautionary approaches when engine failure is considered possible; see FAA JO 7110.65 para
3-10-13. Note: Arresting systems are not available at Minot AFB as referenced in para 8.
34. VFR Entry Procedures:
   34.1. If radar service is not used/available, pilots shall contact Tower with the ATIS code
   prior to entering the Minot AFB Class D airspace and state intentions.
   34.2. Unless otherwise advised by the Tower, fixed-wing aircraft shall enter Minot AFB
   Class D airspace at traffic pattern altitude and fly a 45-degree entry leg to downwind or enter
   via initial.
35. Opposite Direction Procedures: The following minima apply to fixed wing aircraft
operating under IFR and VFR:
MINOTAFBI11-250 14 JANUARY 2014                                                               23


   35.1. Arrival versus Arrival: An arrival shall not proceed closer than 10 mile final until the
   opposing arrival inside of 10 miles has made a full stop, or executed missed approach,
   climbed out, and turned away from the final approach course.
   35.2. Arrival versus Departure: An arrival shall not proceed closer than 10 mile final from
   the time an opposing departure is released, airborne, and turned away from the final approach
   course.
   35.3. Departure versus Arrival: A departure shall not become airborne from the time an
   opposing arrival reaches 10 mile final, lands, or executes a missed approach and climbs out.
36. VFR Pattern Guidelines and Procedures:
   36.1. Rectangular Traffic Pattern
      36.1.1. The rectangular traffic pattern shall normally be entered using a 45 entry to
      downwind. Traffic pattern altitude is 2,900’ MSL. Use of the rectangular pattern is
      based on a reported ceiling at or above 1,700’ AGL and 3 SM visibility. The use of left
      or right closed traffic is permitted as directed by ATC for both Runway 29 and 11. See
      Figure 12.
      36.1.2. Turns to crosswind leg shall not be made prior to the departure end of the
      runway, unless otherwise approved by ATC.

   36.3. Overhead Traffic Pattern
      36.3.1. The overhead traffic pattern is 3,400’ MSL with a left break only for Runway 29
      and a right break only for Runway 11. The overhead pattern is open when there is a
      reported ceiling at or above 2,200’ AGL and 3 SM visibility.
      36.3.2. VFR entry to initial shall be made only after Control Tower approval. Aircraft
      shall report entering a 5-mile initial unless otherwise instructed by the Control Tower.
      36.3.3. Aircraft being radar vectored for the overhead pattern shall be instructed to
      contact the Control Tower no later than 8 miles from the airfield after reporting the
      runway in sight to the radar controller. IFR or basic radar service shall be provided to
      aircraft conducting overhead approaches until aircraft reaches initial.
MINOTAFBI11-250 14 JANUARY 2014                                                               25

Figure 15. Overhead Runway 29




   36.4. Protection of Overhead Traffic Pattern: When aircraft are utilizing the overhead
   traffic pattern, the Control Tower shall ensure that any departing aircraft remain at or below
   2,900’ MSL until departure end of the runway to ensure protection of the overhead pattern.
   36.5. Unusual Maneuvers: The 5 OG/CC, or designated representative, is responsible for
   approving unusual maneuvers in Minot AFB Class D Airspace (aerial demonstrations, high-
   speed passes, etc).
   36.6. Tactical Arrivals/Departures: For tactical arrivals, see ARDA procedures paragraph
   42. Departure procedures are not utilized at Minot AFB.
 26                                                  MINOTAFBI11-250 14 JANUARY 2014


   36.7. Reduced Same Runway Separation Procedures: Reduced Same Runway
   Separation Procedures do not apply at Minot AFB.
37. Radar Traffic Pattern
   37.1. Minot Arrival airspace boundaries consist of a parallel line two miles south of the
   runway and a 20 mile arc north of the runway surface to 6,000’ MSL.
   37.2. Fixed wing aircraft being vectored in the radar traffic pattern shall normally be on a
   downwind 6 miles north of and heading parallel to the runway. Base leg headings shall
   normally be issued between 10-15 miles from the airport on a heading that is 90 degrees off
   the runway heading. Dogleg headings shall be issued to give the aircraft a 30 or less
   intercept angle to final approach (Attachment 7).
   37.3. Helicopter rectangular radar traffic patterns shall be conducted in the same manner as
   paragraph 36.2., with the exception that the downwind can be established three miles north of
   the runway if coordinated between Approach and Control Tower. Base turn shall be issued
   between 7-9 miles from the airport.
   37.4. All portions of the radar traffic pattern shall normally be flown at 4,000’ MSL unless
   otherwise directed by ATC or requested by the pilot and approved by ATC.
   37.5. During periods when the radar is not operational, multiple practice approach patterns
   may be denied. Aircrew should expect to fly multiple practice approaches only in those
   situations where they are absolutely required (i.e. check rides). Under normal circumstances
   with a radar outage, aircrew can expect to fly one approach to a full-stop. Aircrew should
   expect to be given radials to the initial approach fix and to fly the full approach. No vectors
   shall be provided. Depending upon traffic, including traffic at Minot International Airport,
   holding instructions may be issued.

Figure 16. Arrival Airspace
38. Breakout/Missed Approach/Go-around and Local Climbout
   38.1. All aircraft executing an IFR approach and remaining in the radar pattern will be
   instructed to fly runway heading, climb and maintain at or below 2,900’ MSL until departure
   end of runway, then climb and maintain 4,000’ MSL. Locally assigned aircraft will be
   instructed to, “EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT.”
   38.2. Standard go-around shall be used by aircraft 6 miles or less from the runway. Base
   assigned aircraft shall be issued, “EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT” unless otherwise
   coordinated. Transient aircraft shall be issued “FLY RUNWAY HEADING, MAINTAIN
   AT OR BELOW 2,900 UNTIL DEPARTURE END, THEN CLIMB AND MAINTAIN
   4,000.”
   38.3. An aircraft outside of 6 miles that is unable to complete the approach is a “Breakout.”
   The Tower and DATCF shall verbally coordinate the breakout instructions. Aircraft shall be
   issued, “(AIRCRAFT CALL-SIGN), APPROACH/LANDING CLEARANCE CANCELED,
   (ATC INSTRUCTIONS AND REASON).” Aircraft shall acknowledge instructions as soon
   as possible with ATC.
39. Lost Communications
MINOTAFBI11-250 14 JANUARY 2014                                                                27


   39.1. While in the radar pattern, if no transmissions are received for one minute, the aircraft
   shall attempt contact on 363.8 UHF or 119.6 VHF. If no response is received, squawk 7600
   and proceed VFR. If unable to maintain VFR, climb to 6,000’MSL, intercept the Minot AFB
   (MIB) 15 Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) arc to final and proceed with a published
   instrument approach procedure. If on final, outside the final approach fix or turning to final,
   maintain the last altitude assigned by the controller until established on the appropriate
   segment of the approach procedure. If on final, inside the final approach fix and unable to
   proceed visually, execute a missed approach.
   39.2. Departures: If radio communications cannot be established by 30 miles from the MIB
   TACAN, aircraft desiring to return to Minot AFB will squawk 7600, maintain an altitude of
   14,000’ MSL and proceed direct MIB TACAN. Aircraft shall then track out on the MIB 022
   radial to TUBES and hold as published. When the aircraft is ready for the approach, it shall
   IDENT and start descent to 6,000’ MSL in holding. When reaching 6,000’ MSL, the aircraft
   shall execute either the ILS or TACAN to the runway from which it departed.
   39.3. Arrivals: If radio communications cannot be established by 20 miles from the MIB
   TACAN, aircraft will squawk 7600, maintain the last assigned altitude and proceed direct the
   MIB TACAN. Aircraft shall then track outbound on the MIB 022 radial to TUBES and hold
   as published. When the aircraft is ready for the approach it shall IDENT and start descent to
   6,000’ MSL in holding. When reaching 6,000’ MSL, the aircraft shall execute either the ILS
   or TACAN to the runway from which it departed.
40. Helicopter Procedures
   40.1. Avoidance Areas: Helicopters shall not operate over the Minot AFB housing area, the
   WSA adjacent to the APA, the munitions storage area adjacent to the Runway 11 approach
   end, the Combat Arms Training Maintenance (CATM) facility or the grenade firing range,
   unless directed by ATC. When using the North Corridor arrival/departure, remain over the
   drainage ditch for noise abatement and potential forced landing areas. Avoid overflight of
   the MPA and the APA. Avoid overflight of the OPA and Taxiway Juliet when aircraft are
   parked there.
   40.2. Taxiway Echo Operations: Taxiway Echo is a high-density aircraft and uncontrolled
   vehicular transit area (uncontrolled movement area). To enhance safety in the area,
   helicopter operations should be limited to the time necessary for safe aircraft arrival and
   departure. Helicopter aircrews shall exercise extreme caution when operating to/from
   Taxiway Echo and remain vigilant of vehicles at all times.
      40.2.1. The Control Tower shall notify MOC when unaided night helicopter operations
      are in progress on Taxiway Echo.
      40.2.2. The Control Tower shall advise helicopter pilots of known vehicular traffic to
      include 5 MXS trailer operations. Trailer operations entail munitions being moved on
      Taxiway Echo. Restrictions apply because the vehicles used to tow the munitions cannot
      turn around on Taxiway Echo.
   40.3. Helicopter Operational Sites
 28                                                 MINOTAFBI11-250 14 JANUARY 2014


      40.3.1. There are six helicopter operational sites established in accordance with AFTTP
      3-3.H-1. They are: the Helicopter Training Area (HTA), Rescue 1 (R1), Defender 2
      (D2), the Greenhouse, the 5th Medical Group operational site, and area around T-1.

Figure 17. Helicopter Operational Sites




      40.3.2. The 54 HS assumes operational responsibility while conducting operations within
      the operational sites located within in the Minot AFB boundries. The Control Tower
      shall provide traffic advisories, as required, for other air traffic around the Helicopter
      Operational Sites. ATC is not responsible for separation between two or more
      helicopters in the vicinity of the Helicopter Operational Sites. Pilots must receive
      Control Tower approval to extend any of the lateral or vertical limits of any Helicopter
      Operational Site.
      40.3.3. When operating in the Helicopter Operational Sites, aircraft shall remain on the
      Control Tower frequency unless otherwise approved by the Control Tower. Control
      Tower approval is required prior to entering or departing any Helicopter Operational Site.
      40.3.4. The HTA is located directly north of the small arms range, south of Township
      Road, east of the sewage lagoon, and west of Firing Lane. The airspace boundaries are
      defined as follows: within a two statute mile radius of the center of the slide area
      excluding the area south of a line one statute mile north and parallel to the runway
      centerline. The vertical limit of the HTA is from the surface to 2,400’ MSL.
      Participating helicopters shall not operate south of the drainage ditch.
MINOTAFBI11-250 14 JANUARY 2014                                                                 29


     40.3.5. Non-participating aircraft shall remain outside the boundaries of the HTA or
     overfly the HTA at or above 2,900’ MSL.
     40.3.6. Participating aircraft shall not overfly any buildings to include the firing range, or
     the firing range vertical danger zones. Additionally, aircraft shall not operate in the HTA
     when the M-203 grenade launcher range is in use. 54 HS personnel must coordinate with
     CATM prior to using the HTA.
     40.3.7. Rescue 1 is the primary operational site for daytime helicopter operations. It is
     the grassy area between the helicopter parking ramp and Taxiway Echo. This area is
     known as a hover point.
        40.3.7.1. R1 is an unlighted hover point and shall not be used for nighttime unaided
        arrivals or departures.
        40.3.7.2. Nighttime unaided arrivals and departures shall use lighted taxiways or the
        runway. R1 may be used for nighttime aided arrivals and departures (aided
        operations use night vision devices).

3-260-01, AFI 13-204V3, and ACCI 32-1056, Airfield Planning and Design.
78. Prior Permission Required (PPR) Procedures
   78.1. Requests for PPRs will be coordinated through Airfield Management. Airfield
   Management will coordinate all requests for PPRs through the appropriate agencies using
   locally developed operating instructions and checklists.
   78.2. Approved PPR requests and accompanying details will be sent out on the daily
   Transient Aircraft Log to inform the appropriate agencies of mission details, service
   requirements, etc.
   78.3. For PPR requests that fall outside of published Transient Alert hours, published airfield
   hours, or will drive the airfield to open earlier or remain open past closure times, the Airfield
   Operations Flight Commander or his/her representative will forward request details up the
   chain of command to receive approval from the OG/CC to ensure proper maintenance
   support will be provided and no conflicts exist.
79. Air Evacuation Aircraft Notification: The Control Tower will notify Fire Department
when medical Air Evac flights are 15 flying miles out and inbound for landing.
80. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Notification:
   80.1. Airfield Management will notify the Control Tower, DATCF, and Command Post of
   any updated information on arrival or departure of DVs.
   80.2. Command Post will act as the single focal point for all inquiries and information
   concerning DV arrivals. Agencies other than Command Post and Airfield Management will
   not contact DATCF or Control Tower directly. Command Post will receive notification on
   DV arrival from Airfield Management.
   80.3. Airfield Management will request a 60-mile-out call from DATCF. For aircraft being
   controlled using non-radar procedures, a call NLT 30 miles out will be made.
81. Weather and Coordination Procedures: MAFBI 15-101, Weather Support Plan, outlines
hazardous/severe weather notification procedures and lightning response.
   81.1. Airfield Management shall activate the Secondary Crash Net (SCN) when lightning is
   within 5 or 10 miles. The SCN shall also be activated during any weather warnings. Airfield
   management personnel shall also announce over the Ramp Net any information received for
   Weather Watches and Warnings. This is to alert contractors on the airfield and airfield
   drivers of possible adverse conditions.
   81.2. ATC shall receive weather messages through the AFAS. Upon notification of
   lightning within 5 or 10 miles or a tornado warning, the Control Tower shall inform all
   aircraft on their frequencies and include the warnings on the ATIS.
   81.3. The 5 OG/CC or designated representative may authorize aircraft approaches or
   departures if thunderstorms are officially observed between 5 and 10 NM from the
   airfield. Thunderstorms must not be producing hazardous conditions at either the airport or
   in the landing or takeoff corridors being used. Thunderstorms must not be forecast or
   observed to be moving in directions that threaten either the airport or landing/takeoff
 50                                                 MINOTAFBI11-250 14 JANUARY 2014


   corridors. Crew and passengers shall remain on board the aircraft until the lightning warning
   expires. Crews should not expect any ground support during the warning period.
82. Airfield Snow Removal Operations:
   82.1. Each morning during snow season, generally 1 October-1 May, Airfield Management
   shall notify Snow Control (5 CES/CEOHP) of all parking locations for aircraft that are
   expected to fly that day. Updates shall be passed along as required.
   82.2. Airfield Management shall coordinate snow removal priority areas IAW with the
   MAFB Snow and Ice Control Plan. During the 5 BW flying window, the SOF, in
   conjunction with Airfield Management establishes the snow removal priorities. During
   periods outside the 5 BW flying window, Airfield Management shall use the priority pre-
   established in the MAFB Snow and Ice Control Plan and known transient traffic as a
   guideline to directing snow removal operations.
   82.3. Airfield Management shall conduct runway condition readings (RCRs) for the
   runways, taxi routes, parking areas and other required areas of the airfield. Airfield
   Management shall coordinate with SNOW 1 (callsign for the snow control supervisor) and
   the SOF to prioritize snow removal efforts.
   82.4. During snow removal on the runway, Airfield Management will suspend runway
   operations. During runway operation suspension, all vehicles, including Snow Control will
   still be required to contact tower prior to accessing the Controlled Movement Area, IAW AFI
   13-213, Airfield Driving Instruction.
   82.5. 5 OG/CC approval is required for 5 BW aircraft to taxi, takeoff or land when runway
   or taxiway RCR is less than 8.
   82.6. Every effort must be made to have the required surfaces properly prepared when
   aircraft are ready to taxi. Snow removal must continue after taxi begins but the target time
   for having the airfield ready for operations should be NLT 30 minutes prior to takeoff.
   82.7. The decision to use potassium acetate shall be made by 5 OG/CC based on
   recommendations by Snow Control.
   82.8. When snow removal is required on the runway, snow control vehicles should be given
   priority access to the runway over aircraft practice approaches. During these times, aircraft
   should expect a restricted low approach at or above 500 feet.
   82.9. SNOW 1 may assume responsibility for all snow control vehicles and be the single
   point of contact for reporting all snow vehicles in and out of the CMA, provided that SNOW
   1 remains in the immediate vicinity of the CMA. Additionally, all snow control vehicles will
   scan the RAMP Net and have the ability for two-way radio contact with Tower, IAW AFI
   13-213, Airfield Driving Instruction, in the event it becomes necessary to have the vehicles
   exit the area.
83. 5 BW Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Procedures: Refer to MAFBI 91-
212, Minot AFB Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Program, for specific agency
responsibilities. During wing flying operations, the 5 OG/CC determines the Bird Watch
Condition (BWC). The authority to upgrade or downgrade the BWC rests with the 5 OG/CC or
the SOF, acting as his/her representative. Airfield Management shall determine the BWC in the
absence of the SOF. Airfield Management provides recommendations for determining,
MINOTAFBI11-250 14 JANUARY 2014                                                                   51


upgrading or downgrading the BWC to the 5 OG/CC and the SOF. The Control Tower provides
bird sightings or reports to Airfield Management for relay to Command Post, the SOF, and
5 BW/SE.
   83.1. BWC Terms and Restrictions:
      83.1.1. BWC Low: Bird activity on and around the airfield represents a low potential for
      strikes. No operating restrictions.
      83.1.2. BWC Moderate: Bird activity near the active runway that presents an increased
      potential for strikes. More specifically, this refers to bird activity that does not affect the
      runway or the flight path of an aircraft, but presents a suitable hazard if birds alter their
      flight path. BWC MODERATE requires increased vigilance by all agencies, supervisors,
      and aircrews. Takeoffs and full stop landings are allowed. Transition training by fixed
      wing aircraft requires 5 OG/CC approval and shall be kept to the minimum required for
      mission accomplishment.
      83.1.3. BWC Severe: Bird activity on or immediately above the active runway or other
      specific location representing high potential for strikes or affecting the flight path of
      inbound or departing aircraft. Supervisors and aircrews must thoroughly evaluate
      mission needs before conducting operations in areas under BWC SEVERE. 5 OG/CC
      approval is required for all takeoff and landings of fixed wing aircraft. Transition
      training is prohibited.
      83.1.4. The Control Tower is the primary agency for transmitting the BWC to airborne
      aircraft or aircraft awaiting departure. The Control Tower shall ensure any BWC other
      than low is included in the ATIS broadcast.
   83.2. 54 HS BWC Operating Guidance:
      83.2.1. During BWC Low: No operational restrictions exist.
      83.2.2. During BWC Moderate: Pilots shall limit patterns to a minimum.
      83.2.3. During BWC Severe: Within the traffic pattern, only full stop landings are
      permitted.
84. SOF/Tower/Airfield Management Interface:
   84.1. The Airfield Operations Flight Commander shall provide a dedicated SOF position
   with radio and landline communications in the Tower. The 5 BW SOF normally occupies
   this position, but other units may utilize it upon request. A SOF shall be available IAW AFI
   11-418.
   84.2. Tower shall:
      84.2.1. Not clear 5 BW aircraft for departure without a SOF in the Control Tower unless
      prior notification has been received that the SOF shall be operating elsewhere. This
      provision can only be waived by the 5 OG/CC or his/her representative.
      84.2.2. Inform the SOF of any changes that impact flying or ATC training requirements,
      such as schedule changes, etc.
 52                                                   MINOTAFBI11-250 14 JANUARY 2014


       84.2.3. Coordinate and track SOF console (Enhanced Terminal Voice Switch [ETVS],
       position 5) equipment outages with Airfield Systems. The Control Tower shall not track
       outages with the SOF’s computer or LAN equipment.
   84.3. Supervisor of Flying shall:
       84.3.1. Complete an equipment check of the ETVS to include all radios and landlines
       prior to assuming SOF duties.
       84.3.2. Utilize a headset and a muted speaker console arrangement to the maximum
       extent possible and when requested by the watch supervisor.
       84.3.3. When advice is extremely technical, or when the SOF feels that relay of
       information by the controller could cause an unacceptable delay, coordinate with the
       watch supervisor to transmit directly to the affected aircraft. The SOF must not perform
       ATC functions or transmit ATC instructions or clearances to an aircraft. The use of ATC
       communications equipment for messages not directly associated with air traffic services
       is governed by FAA Order JO 7210.3, Facility Operation and Administration. IAW AFI
       13-204V3, a person who commandeers an ATC frequency assumes responsibility for
       separation of aircraft. In addition, as the SOF position has its own dedicated lines, the
       SOF should not use ATC intercom or phone lines without coordinating with the watch
       supervisor.
       84.3.4. Avoid coordinating directly with tower controllers. All coordination and requests
       shall be passed through the watch supervisor.
       84.3.5. Inform the watch supervisor of any changes that impact flying or required pilot
       training such as schedule/mission changes, check rides, etc.
85. Taking of Photographs on the Airfield: All personnel requesting permission to take
photographs of the airfield or facilities/aircraft on the airfield should refer to Minot AFB Plan 31
vol 1, Integrated Defense Plan. 5 OG/CC is the approval authority for all airfield photo passes
distributed to individuals that are not involved with media for profit. Media agencies shall
coordinate with Public Affairs prior to contacting Airfield Management for photo
passes. Airfield Management shall notify Security Forces of approved airfield photo passes.
86. Night Vision Device (NVD) Procedures for Airfield Operations Personnel: Airfield
Operations personnel shall not use NVDs while operating a vehicle on the airfield or in the
Control Tower while working a control position. Procedures for situations that may require
Airfield Management use of NVDs while driving on the airfield can be found in MAFBI 13-213.
87. Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) Training Area Procedures: When notified of
activation, Tower shall avoid aircraft overflights at or below 1,000 AGL or as requested.
MINOTAFBI11-250 14 JANUARY 2014                                                                53
