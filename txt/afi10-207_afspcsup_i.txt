                                            Chapter 1

                                       ORGANIZATION

1.1. Command Post
    1.1.1. Unless otherwise indicated in this instruction, the term CP applies to HHQ command
    centers/watches, installation command posts, and CP work centers (Air Mobility Command
    Centers, etc.).
    1.1.2. Each installation (base, station, etc.) operating a CP will maintain and operate a single
    CP (where determined to be legal and beneficial) to support C2 activities/functions for all
    resident and tenant units/organizations. CP infrastructure is comprised in one of the
    following ways:
       1.1.2.1. Command Post. The CP serves as one of the core functions of the IC2 construct.
       The CP is a full-time, 24/7 C2 node, directly responsible to commander(s) and serves as
       the focal point of operations, as well as the receipt and dissemination of orders,
       information, and requests necessary for the C2 of assigned forces and operations.
       1.1.2.2. Consolidated Command Post. A CP comprised of CP elements from two or
       more separate wings/units from the same component who merge together to share a
       common facility with each element responsive to the same CP managers. There is one
       set of CP managers, one chain of command, and the controllers are trained and certified
       to facilitate C2 for every mission aspect represented by the host and former tenant CP.
       Active Component (AC) manpower authorizations at a Consolidated CP will be owned
       by the MAJCOM operating the installation and 1C3 billets will be assigned to the host
       wing Program Element Code (PEC). Individuals from different components may
       perform duties within a Consolidated Command Post during austere manning, e.g.
       activation of ARC forces.         NOTE: NAF/AFCHQ/FOA/DRU are included in
       consolidation actions.
           1.1.2.2.1. All personnel working in a Consolidated CP must be thoroughly trained
           and certified on mission tasks performed prior to the consolidation. All mission tasks
           and responsibilities (e.g., operating instructions (OIs), quick reaction checklists
           (QRCs) and duties and responsibilities) will be incorporated into the Consolidated CP
           mission, IAW this instruction. CP managers will ensure continued training on
           mission tasks using the 1C3 Master Training Plan (MTP) and Chapter 7 of this
           instruction. Controller training (certification, recertification, written and performance
           examinations), as well as semiannual evaluations, will emphasize time sensitive
           mission task prioritization, in addition to controllers recognizing the need to save
           lives, protect resources, and accomplish the mission.
           1.1.2.2.2. Consolidated CPs will only be referred to as “(Base name) CP.”
           1.1.2.2.3. ARC manpower authorizations at a Consolidated CP will be owned by the
           ARC element they represent.
       1.1.2.3. CP Association. A CP comprised of CP elements from two or more separate
       wings/units from different components (AC or ARC) who share a common facility with
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                             9


     each element responsive to the same CP managers. The CP manager team will normally
     be a mixture of the components involved. ADCON of controllers resides with the
     component they are a member of, i.e., ARC personnel work administratively for ARC.
     Controllers in a CP Association are trained on all mission tasks supported by the CP
     Association. This type of CP applies where the determination has been made that
     component-specific mission aspects can be mutually supported by the CP console crew.
     This type of CP is not applicable where CP elements from only one component are
     concerned; in that instance refer to Consolidated CP.
        1.1.2.3.1. All personnel working in a CP Associations must be thoroughly trained
        and certified on mission tasks performed prior to combining. All mission tasks and
        responsibilities (e.g., OIs, QRCs, and duties and responsibilities) will be incorporated
        into the CP Association mission, IAW this instruction. CP managers will ensure
        continued training on mission tasks using the 1C3 MTP and Chapter 7 of this
        instruction. Controller training (certification, recertification, written and performance
        examinations), as well as semiannual evaluations, will emphasize-time sensitive
        mission task prioritization in addition to controllers recognizing the need to save
        lives, protect resources, and accomplish the mission.
        1.1.2.3.2. CP Associations must obtain CSAF approval through the Total Force
        Enterprise (TFE) Review Process. Units will coordinate proposals through
        MAJCOMs and submit to AF/A3O for TFE Review, legal review, and CSAF
        approval. Use AFI 90-1001, Responsibilities for Total Force Integration as guidance
        when preparing proposals. Should the combining of components present legally
        significant issues, AF/JAA will coordinate with SAF/GCM for additional review.
        Any significant operational concerns will be addressed by AF/A3O.
        1.1.2.3.3. CP Associations must be properly staffed according to approved
        memorandums of agreement/memorandums of understanding (MOAs/MOUs) that
        adhere to the CSAF approved construct. Coordination among component and
        MAJCOM 1C3 MFMs is vital to ensure each mission is supported without
        degradation.
        1.1.2.3.4. CP Associations will only be referred to as “(Base name) CP.”
        1.1.2.3.4. (AFSPC) AFSPC CP Associations are Patrick CP (responsible for the 45
        Space Wing (SW)/920 Rescue Wing (RQW) (AFRC), Schriever CP (responsible for
        the 50 SW/310 SW(AFRC), and Peterson CP (responsible for the 21SW/302
        AW(AFRC).
     1.1.2.4. Collocated Command Post. A CP comprised of CP controllers from two or more
     separate wings/units from different components (AC or ARC) who share a common
     facility. Each CP element has its own CP managers, chain of command and C2
     responsibilities. Controllers in a Collocated CP may share information with one another,
     but do not share work, i.e., controllers are not trained to perform one another’s
     component specific mission. Additionally, both ADCON and OPCON of CP controllers
     reside with the commander from each controller's component. This type of CP only
     applies to a CP whose elements are from different components, where organization of a
     Consolidated CP/ CP Association, is deemed impractical. This type of CP is not
     applicable where only the CP elements from a single component are concerned.
10                                                AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013


     1.1.2.5. Regional Command Post. A CP that is fully integrated into one facility
     comprised of CP personnel from two or more installations in the same geographical
     region and may include CP elements from different components (AC or ARC). ADCON
     of ARC CP personnel resides with the ARC unit commander to which they are assigned.
     There is one set of CP managers and all CP controllers are capable of facilitating C2 for
     every mission aspect represented by all wings and tenant units supported. Once
     established, Regional CP will follow the same guidance as Consolidated CP/ CP
     Association as outlined in this instruction.
     1.1.2.5. (AFSPC) The Colorado Springs Regional Command Post (CSRCP) will be
     responsible for providing effective C2 to the 10th Air Base Group (ABG) and United
     States Air Force Academy [USAFA]; the 50 SW and 310 SW [Schriever Air Force Base
     (AFB)]; and the 21 SW and 302 Airlift Wing (AW) [Peterson AFB], which are all
     geographically located in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
        1.1.2.5.1. All personnel working in a Regional CP must be thoroughly trained and
        certified on mission tasks performed prior to the regionalizing. All mission tasks and
        responsibilities, e.g., OIs, QRCs, and duties and responsibilities will be incorporated
        into the Regional CP mission, IAW this instruction. CP managers will ensure
        continued training on mission tasks using the 1C3 MTP and Chapter 7 of this
        instruction. Controller training (certification, recertification, written and performance
        examinations), as well as semiannual evaluations, will emphasize time sensitive
        mission task prioritization in addition to controllers recognizing the need to save
        lives, protect resources, and accomplish the mission.
        1.1.2.5.2. Prior to creation of a Regional CP, composed of more than one component
        the same coordination from paragraph 1.1.2.3.2, above, must be accomplished.
        1.1.2.5.3. Regional CP establishment must be coordinated with the CP MFM(s),
        MAJCOM A3(s), and the AFCFM. Final approval authority is the AF/A3O.
        1.1.2.5.4. AC manpower authorizations at a Regional CP will be owned by the
        MAJCOM operating the installation. 1C3s billets will be under the host wing PEC.
        1.1.2.5.5. ARC manpower authorizations at a Regional CP will be owned by the
        ARC element they represent.
        1.1.2.5.6. Region CPs will only be referred to as “(Region) CP.”
     1.1.2.6. MAJCOM headquarters are authorized to operate a separate command center
     and will be aligned IAW with this AFI.
     1.1.2.6. (AFSPC) The AFSPC Command Center will operate independently of the
     CSRCP.
     1.1.2.7. Waivers to operate separate, stand-alone CPs on single installation due to
     mission considerations will be considered on a case-by-case basis. AF/A3/5 may waive
     the requirements for consolidation/combining/collocating if doing so would degrade the
     C2 of operational resources. Refer to Attachment 2 for waiver format.
     1.1.2.7. (AFSPC) Submit waiver requests IAW Chapter 14.
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                         11


   1.1.3. Air Operations Centers (AOC) are governed by AFI 13-1, AOC Volumes 1-3. AOCs
   without an Air Mobility Division (AMD) are not authorized 1C3s. 1C3X1s who are
   authorized and assigned to AOCs will follow the AFI 13-1 series. Utilization of a 1C3X1
   from another function (e.g., MAJCOM Command Center) to fill manning in an AOC is not
   authorized. Command Centers physically located in an AOC will be physically separated
   due to the nature of the duties and Emergency Action Procedures (EAP).
   1.1.4. AF organizations at the wing or group level residing on an installation operated by
   another service component (i.e., Joint Basing) may maintain and operate a stand-alone CP
   when the C2 needs of the AF organization cannot be met by the host unit. Waivers for joint
   base installations will through all affected wing/unit CCs and MAJCOM/A3s; waiver
   authority is AF/A3O.
1.2. C2 Direction.
   1.2.1. The Chief of Staff, United States Air Force (CSAF) exercises C2 of AF forces through
   a global structure of fixed and expeditionary C2 facilities. The AF Service Watch Cell
   (AFSWC), as part of the AF Operations Group (AFOG), provides positive and effective C2
   of AF assets in support of the AF mission. The AFSWC communicates CSAF direction
   directly to MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs.
      1.2.1.1. The AFOG is an FOA which reports directly to the Director of Air Operations
      (A3O), under the Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS), Operations, Plans and Requirements
      (A3/5). In addition to operating the AFSWC, it performs a multitude of functions, such
      as: Providing briefings to the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) and CSAF;
      contingency response and oversight for HQ USAF through the stewardship of the
      Headquarters Air Force (HAF) Crisis Action Team (CAT); weather operations in support
      of the White House and HQ USAF; and aerial event and flyover coordination and
      approval.
      1.2.1.2. As the vital information link between MAJCOMs and AFCHQs, Unified
      Commands, and the Joint Staff, the AFOG provides air and space power
      recommendations to the CSAF and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) during
      contingencies, crises, and wartime operations. Additionally, the AFOG is responsible
      for:
          1.2.1.2.1. Organizing, training, equipping, and running the HAF CAT.
          1.2.1.2.2. Organizing, training, equipping, and running the AFSWC.
          1.2.1.2.3. Serving as the office of primary responsibility (OPR) on all requests for
          AF forces and personnel.
          1.2.1.2.4. Providing daily operations/intelligence briefs to SECAF/CSAF.
          1.2.1.2.5. Providing weather support to the President, Secretary of Defense, Joint
          Staff, Sister Services, and other government agencies.
   1.2.2. MAJCOM command centers direct/exercise C2 of MAJCOM resources. Within the
   MAJCOM C2 structure, the MAJCOM command center is authorized to communicate
   command (CJCS, Combatant Command [COCOM], USAF, or MAJCOM) directions to
   operational organizations. However, there will be instances where CJCS or COCOM
   direction is communicated directly to the AFCHQ AOC or executing/supporting forces (e.g.,
 12                                                  AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013


   Operations Plan [OPLAN] 8010 directives). MAJCOM command centers originate
   command directions, oversee status and location of MAJCOM resources, and manage
   operational reporting. MAJCOM command centers that fall under COCOM direction will
   continue to follow this instruction except where it is inconsistent with specific COCOM
   direction.
   1.2.2. (AFSPC) The AFSPC Command Center communicates AF service direction and
   AFSPC Commander (CC) direction to AFSPC units and oversees the CP activities of
   assigned NAFs, wings, and direct reporting units (DRUs) in AFSPC.
   1.2.3. The installation CP is the primary agency authorized to communicate command
   (CJCS, COCOM, USAF, or MAJCOM) directions to operational organizations supporting
   the entire installation (e.g., security forces, base operations). CP is the only installation C2
   function authorized to receive and process Emergency Action Messages (EAM) and prepare
   and transmit AF operational reports (AF OPREP-3). Installation CPs will provide C2
   support to tenant units, to include relaying command directions, flight following, and
   operational reporting.       Tenant units must coordinate and communicate operational
   requirements involving host resources through the CP. Resulting MOAs will be developed
   IAW AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures and maintained on file.
   1.2.4. Waivers. Unless otherwise stated, A3O has delegated A3O-AC, as the waiver
   authority for this AFI. Operational waivers must be routed and signed by the MAJCOM/A3
   (may be delegated to the next lower level) prior to being submitted to the HAF/A3O-AC. All
   other waivers unless specifically identified within this AFI will be routed from the Wg/CC to
   the MAJCOM/MFM up to the AFCFM. Refer to Attachment 2 for the required waiver
   format. Approved waivers will be valid for a period of 1 year from approval date unless the
   waiver approval states otherwise.
1.3. Organization.
   1.3.1. The MAJCOM command center is the focal point of the MAJCOMs operations and
   conducts activities according to MAJCOM plans and policies. MAJCOM command centers
   will be organized as a staff agency under the MAJCOM commander, typically
   administratively aligned under the Director of Staff (DS) or Director of Operations (A3).
   Additionally, MAJCOM command centers will not be aligned/assigned under an AFCHQ
   AOC.
   1.3.2. The installation CP is the focal point of an installations operation and conducts
   activities according to assigned units’ plans and policies.
      1.3.2.1. The installation CP serves as the executive agency for C2 for commanders
      during routine operations, emergencies, contingencies, and increased readiness. The CP
      is a direct representative of the commander and serves as the sole agency responsible for
      executing CP related C2 activities. CP functions and responsibilities will not be
      delegated to external agencies.
      1.3.2.2. The installation CP will be a wing staff office organized directly under the wing
      organizational structure. CP managers are tasked with the responsibility of operating the
      CP on behalf of the wing commander. As such, either the wing commander or vice wing
      commander will be the reporting official for the CP Chief. In cases where installation
      CPs are not assigned a CP Chief, the wing commander or vice wing commander will be
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                             13


       the reporting official for the CP Superintendent. No additional operational layers of
       organization will be established between CP managers, the on-duty CP controllers, and
       the wing commander/vice.
       1.3.2.3. The small unit CP (i.e., Munitions Support Squadrons [MUNSS]) is organized as
       a flight within the squadron. As such, the squadron commander will be the reporting
       official for the CP Chief.
       1.3.2.4. At joint bases where the AF is the supporting component, the CP remains the
       responsibility of the Operational (Mission) Wing Commander
1.4. Operational Unit Responsibility. The responsibility to establish and operate the CP
resides with the installation commander. The CP will serve as the core 24/7 C2 node of the IC2.
The CP will provide full C2 support to all installation units.
1.5. CP Functional Areas.
   1.5.1. As a minimum, CPs consist of the following functional areas: Command Post
   Operations with Emergency Action (EA) cell (if applicable), Reports, and Training. These
   functional areas perform duties in support of four core competencies: Mission monitoring,
   EA, emergency management, and operational reporting (includes Status of Resources and
   Training System [SORTS]).
   1.5.2. MAJCOMs (in coordination with assigned or supported COCOMs) should consider,
   and may specify, additional peacetime/wartime functions for collocation or removal from the
   CP when not required due to mission type. Areas to consider are: Security control; mobility
   control; air defense control; damage control; Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
   Nuclear (CBRN) control; and base defense operations.
1.6. Provisions.
   1.6.1. CP will not be tasked to utilize Mass Notification Systems (MNS) to push “routine”
   public address announcements.
       1.6.1.1. CPs will not be tasked to review/route routine or non-emergency base-
       wide/MAJCOM headquarters message traffic.
       1.6.1.2. CP will not serve as the base telephone operator, point of contact (POC)/primary
       operator of the base marquee, base public web page, or video teleconferencing (VTC)

       on single controller waivers are not authorized to leave the CP controlled/restricted area
       without a replacement controller.
3.2. Security Clearances. All 1C3s/officers assigned to CP must possess a TS clearance. Any
assigned 3D0X1 personnel must possess a security clearance commensurate with the unit’s
mission. Due to the amount of time involved in security background investigations, individuals
may perform CP controller duties after being granted an appropriate interim TS clearance while
awaiting Defense Security Service actions, adjudication, and award of final TS clearance.
   3.2.1. Controllers serving in a critical PRP billet must be eligible for a TS security clearance
   based on a SSBI or SSBI-PR completed and adjudicated within the last five years. Refer to
   AFMAN 10-3902, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) for additional

   3.2.2. At no time will the EA console be manned where both controllers on duty possess
   only an interim TS clearance.
   3.2.3. At no time will the single controller possess only an interim TS clearance. This
   restriction also applies to positions with single controllers trained in Headquarters, United
   States Strategic Command EAP (EAP-STRAT) and/or deployed to an overseas theater for
   OPLAN 8010 reconnaissance operations.
   3.2.4. All personnel from other functional areas performing duties in the CP must possess, as
   a minimum, a Secret clearance (e.g., MOC, ATOC).
   3.2.5. All 1C3X1 personnel, regardless of assignment, will maintain a current TS security
   clearance once an initial TS has been awarded. CP managers will ensure each 1C3X1
   assigned to the CP has a current TS security clearance and submits their periodic review in a
   timely manner. This includes all 1C3X1 personnel serving in C2 facilities where TS
   information is not processed/maintained on a routine basis. If a 1C3X1’s TS security
   clearance has been permanently revoked, CP managers will immediately initiate procedures
   to remove the individual from the 1C3X1 AFSC.
   3.2.5. (AFSPC) Notify HQ AFSPC/A3OP, CP Policy and Procedures, via e-mail if an
   individual’s Top Secret clearance has been temporarily or permanently revoked.
   Additionally, ensure this information is annotated on the monthly manning report.
3.3. Additional Qualifications. Additional qualifications may be required locally or by
MAJCOMs to support unique mission or functional area requirements (e.g., certification under
the PRP, access to Sensitive Compartmented Information [SCI], or OPLAN 8010).

3.4. Duty Schedule and Restrictions. Due to the 24-hours a day, 7 days a week, manning
requirement for the C2 facility, CP controllers working rotating shifts (e.g., console controller
duty) will not perform additional duties/details beyond the scope of C2 functions (e.g., base
clean up, snow removal, augmentee duties) outside of the CP. This provision does not apply to
personnel assigned to overhead positions who routinely work normal day shift schedules. CP
personnel who reside in the dormitory are not exempt from performing bay orderly functions in
the dorm common areas.
   3.4.1. The duty schedule is approved by the CP Superintendent or designated alternate.
   3.4.2. Each CP is different with regard to creating a work schedule. Controllers will not
   perform more than 12 hours of continuous duty (plus necessary time for shift changeover)
   and will be provided eight hours of uninterrupted rest before shift or any scheduled CP
   meetings. EXCEPTION: In times of emergency, controllers may be required to perform
   duty in excess of 12 hours to ensure uninterrupted C2. The standard work schedule for
   deployed operations is 12-hour shifts, 6 days on duty, 1 day off. This standard supports the
   C2 force module concept of all 9ACP UTCs (6x 1C3X1s) per location as the manpower
   baseline for deployed operations.
   3.4.3. CP controllers will not consume alcohol within eight hours preceding a scheduled
   console shift, or while on console duty.
   3.4.4. CP managers may appoint personnel as project officers for base activities or to
   attend/become full-time members of base-level working groups (e.g., EET, Base Security
   Council), as long as it does not negatively impact day-to-day operation of the CP.
   3.4.5. CP controllers must coordinate leave requests and appointments with the duty
   scheduler NLT the 15th day of the preceding month of a published duty schedule.
   Controllers will plan for bay orderly duties, dental and medical appointments, WAPS testing,
   training requirements, and leave projections and make every effort to de-conflict with the
   schedule. Controllers will advise supervisors of appointment scheduling/rescheduling
   problems immediately.
   3.4.6. External agencies must consult with CP managers NLT the 15th day of the preceding
   month before scheduling CP personnel for WAPS testing, training, bay orderly, or mandatory
   appointments, to prevent duty interference/impact to CP operations.
   3.4.7. CP controllers will be afforded 24 hours off prior to WAPS and CDC)/Upgrade
   Training EOC testing IAW para 2.6.12. of this AFI.
   3.4.8. CP managers will designate a minimum of one individual to attend mandatory
   formations (e.g., Commander’s Call). The designated individual attending the mandatory
   formation will brief all CP personnel on items of interest during the next training meeting
   and/or establish a CIF item for information requiring immediate dissemination. CP overhead
   personnel are required to attend mandatory formations, unless performing console duties or
   otherwise excused by CP managers.
   3.4.9. To aid analysis of work distribution, duty schedules (to include changes) will be
   retained for a minimum of six months and may be maintained electronically.
   3.4.10. Shift Requirements. All certified controllers are required to perform at least two full
   shifts per calendar month verified through events log review. Individuals not meeting this
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                            31


   requirement will be decertified and must complete recertification training and be recertified
   IAW Chapter 7 of this AFI. ARC Traditional CP management and controllers must perform
   4 hrs of console currency a month or 8 hrs in 60 days to maintain certification, verified by
   events log entry. NOTE: controllers, and certified back office personnel can take up to 59
   days of consecutive leave or TDY without being decertified for not working two full shifts
   per month.
3.5. Unit Manning.
   3.5.1. UMD General Information. Manpower management is an essential part of resource
   management and key to mission accomplishment. CP managers must understand the basics
   of identifying and managing manpower to meet the mission.
      3.5.1.1. The UMD is a computer-generated product extracted from the Manpower
      Programming and Execution System (MPES) and is a key product used in the
      management of manpower resources at all organizational levels. It lists the number and
      type of manpower (enlisted, officer, or civilian); authorized and required grades, and
      AFSC required by personnel accounting symbol (PAS); Functional Account Code (FAC);
      Office Symbol Code (OSC); and whether the positions are funded or unfunded
      requirements.
      3.5.1.2. Additional data codes are also used to further define positions and organizational
      structure, such as duty titles, supervisory positions, organizational structure titles,
      authorization effective dates, and Program Element Codes (PEC). The UMD does not
      reflect information about the individuals who are filling the authorized positions; the
      UPMR, generated by the personnel community, provides specific data associated with
      assigned personnel.
      3.5.1.3. CP managers will request a UMD from the installation Manpower Office (MO)
      quarterly. Managers will then review their UMD to ensure it accurately reflects unit
      requirements. Immediately report any UMD changes or discrepancies to the unit
      manpower POC and MFM.
          3.5.1.3.1. AF, MAJCOM, and unit actions can affect authorization levels. Some
          actions not only affect authorization levels, but can also impact the funded grade. A
          grade imbalance between what is required and what is funded (authorized) may occur
          as a result of legislative and budgetary constraints on the allocated grades or HHQ
          action.
          3.5.1.3.2. HQ USAF implements congressional and DoD grade constraints by
          creating grade factors. The two types of factors created and distributed are: (1)
          overall command grade factors for each enlisted grade and (2) Career Progression
          Group (CPG) factors for each AFSC, to the first three digits. Command grade factors
          ensure authorized grades do not exceed command ceiling constraints. A CPG factor
          ensures equitable allocation of the grades within each AFSC in each command. Both
          types of factors are applied to the budgeted end strength. AFCFMs can recommend
          adjustments to HQ USAF/A1M, but when making adjustments, they must maintain a
          zero sum gain of total grades allocated for each command.
   3.5.2. Initiating and Tracking Manpower Changes to the UMD.
32                                                AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013


     3.5.2.1. A unit will periodically need to change an existing requirement on the UMD to
     realign positions or grade conversions, etc. An authorization change request (ACR) is
     used to request this change. The unit identifies the requested change and provides
     detailed justification and installation functional POC information to the servicing MO.
     The MAJCOM/A1 POC evaluates the request and coordinates it with the MFM before
     finalizing the request.
     3.5.2.2. If the ACR is approved, the MAJCOM POC updates the change in the MPES
     and the servicing MO will receive an authorization change notice (ACN) generated by
     the MPES. The MO will send a copy of the ACN to the affected unit’s POC. The ACN
     details the approved change, rationale for the change, and the name of the MAJCOM
     project POC. To ensure the accuracy of the UMD, unit POCs should update their UMD
     as soon as they receive an ACN. If the request is disapproved, the MAJCOM provides
     rationale to the submitting unit through the servicing MO.
  3.5.3. UPMR. CP managers gather information on other full time/part time borrowed or
  loaned personnel and update this information monthly through the commander’s support staff
  (CSS) or equivalent. The UPMR reflects the “faces” to the UMD “spaces” and is critical to
  ensure personnel are assigned to positions on the CP UMD. An imbalance between the
  UMD and UPMR can have a negative impact on the mission and the unit’s ability to meet
  AEF taskings. CP managers will request UPMR quarterly, and report discrepancies to the
  CSS and MFM immediately.
  3.5.4. Preparing the CP Manning Report. The CP manning report provides CP functional
  managers with current and projected manning status based on the UMD and UPMR. It is a
  valuable tool assisting in determining future manning and tasking priorities. OPR for this
  report is the AFCFM. MAJCOMs may add to the content of the manning report; however, as
  a minimum, the manning report will contain the information stipulated in para 3.5.5 of this
  AFI. Consolidated CP/ CP Association manning reports will meet the requirements of all
  parent MAJCOMs/functional managers (e.g., MAJCOM MFMs, and ANG Functional
  Manager). CP managers will:
     3.5.4.1. Ensure the PDS accurately reflects authorizations.
     3.5.4.2. Maintain an updated current (quarterly) copy of the UMD and UPMR.
     3.5.4.3. Verify accuracy of duty AFSC and position number on personnel actions.
     3.5.4.4. Maintain a suspense file of personnel actions and verify approved actions are
     correctly entered into the PDS.
     3.5.4.5. Coordinate permanent change of assignment (PCA) actions. Ensure required
     documentation is completed and submitted.
     3.5.4.6. Allocate projected gains against forecasted or actual vacant authorizations.
  3.5.5. CP Manning Report Submission Instructions. The manning report will be submitted
  monthly to MFMs (AD FOAs/DRUs will submit reports to AFCFM), refer to Attachment 4
  for an example. When significant changes occur that require HHQ involvement, CP
  managers will notify the MFM/AFCFM (as applicable) ASAP. MAJCOMs may develop
  guidance or instruction for submitting manning reports; however they must contain a
  minimum of the following:
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                           33


  3.5.5. (AFSPC) CP Manning Report Submission. Use the AFSPC Manning Report format
  and detailed guidance provided at Attachment 7 and submit the report NLT the fifth
  calendar day of the month, via e-mail, to HQ AFSPC/A3OP, CP Policy and Procedures. The
  report “as of date” is the first day of the month.
     3.5.5.1. Position. The 7-digit position number (PN) from the UMD.
     3.5.5.2. Authorized Rank. Rank authorized for PN.
     3.5.5.3. Authorized AFSC. AFSC authorized for PN.
     3.5.5.4. Assigned Rank. Rank of person currently assigned to PN. If the person has
     been selected for promotion, include the letter “P” immediately after the current rank.
     3.5.5.5. Name. The full name and middle initial of person assigned to PN. If more than
     one person is assigned to a single PN, ensure this is properly reflected. Include projected
     gains and annotate month/year gained in remarks. Designate senior controller status next
     to name (e.g., Jones, James A. -SR).
     3.5.5.6. Date Arrived Station (DAS). The date individual arrived on station. Use month
     and year (e.g., Feb 07).
     3.5.5.7. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Projection. The date member is scheduled
     to perform a PCS move. Use month and year (e.g., Feb 07).
     3.5.5.8. Deployment Status. This block reflects the last date an individual deployed to
     support a contingency tasking. Use month and year (e.g., Feb 07). Annotate “none” if an
     individual has not previously deployed. Use “non-deployable” if an individual cannot
     deploy. NOTE: Do not state the reason a member cannot deploy as this may violate The
     Privacy Act of 1974 or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
     Finally, include the AEF Tempo Band the member is assigned to.
     3.5.5.9. Remarks. Mandatory remarks, if applicable, are listed below. Other remarks
     may be added as necessary (e.g., if individual is decertified, has PRP or security
     clearance issues, or anything else affecting CP manning). Mandatory remarks follow:
        3.5.5.9.1. Identify CP Chief, Superintendent, NCOIC CP Operations, NCOIC
        Training and NCOIC Reports. Also identify SORTS Program Manager, if SORTS is
        a separate function from Reports.
        3.5.5.9.2. Projected gains and losses to include rank, name, and projected gain/loss
        date.
        3.5.5.9.3. TDY status for TDYs 15 or more days in duration, to include estimated
        time of return (ETR) or projected departure date (PDD). For example: TDY JEFX
        07-1, ETR 15 Jun 06, or Tasked for AEF 1, PDD 28 Aug 06.
        3.5.5.9.4. CPs supporting OPLAN 8010 taskings or US Air Forces Europe (USAFE)
        Nonstrategic Nuclear Forces (NSNF) must aggressively track award of the Nuclear
        C2 SEI. CP managers will denote CP controllers not yet awarded the Nuclear C2 SEI
        and state the reason and estimated date of award (EDA). For example: “Has attended
        the Joint Nuclear C2 (JNC2) Course and is formally certified, but does not have 12
        months experience/EDA Feb 07.”

            CONSOLE OPERATIONS REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES

5.1. Publications Library. The CP will establish and maintain a publications library IAW this
chapter, MAJCOM guidance, and AFI 33-322. A sufficient number of copies will be maintained
to support console operations, training, and ACP. Publications that are allowed to be maintained
electronically must have backup copies available (e.g., portable hard drive, CD-R or DVD-R), to
ensure document survivability during equipment outages/catastrophic failures.
5.1. (AFSPC)Publications Library. AFSPC CPs will maintain the minimum publications
listed in Attachment 1 of this supplement.
5.2. OIs.
   5.2.1. OIs will be developed when the situation cannot be completely covered by QRCs or as
   mission changes dictate (e.g., new requirements, consolidating/combining CP). OIs must
   contain complete information to accomplish the specific task involved and reference all
   applicable publications and background materials (e.g., policy directives, instructions,
   operator’s manuals). OIs must be reviewed by CP managers prior to publication and
   semiannually after publication. The review will be documented on the AF Form 4436 and
   maintained in all OI binder(s).
   5.2.2. CP OIs relating to Nuclear Surety will be reviewed by Unit Weapons Safety
   semiannually, IAW AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program.
   5.2.3. Each CP will maintain current applicable OIs. OIs will be prepared and numbered
   IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. OIs may be combined, at the
   discretion of CP managers, so long as the topics are adequately addressed (e.g., equipment
   operation and communications systems listing, outages, and reporting). The minimum
   required OIs are:
       5.2.3.1. Specific controller duties and responsibilities (10-series).
       5.2.3.2. Local training and certification procedures (10/36-series).
       5.2.3.3. Equipment operation (e.g., emergency power, alarm systems, closed circuit
       flight line video, Giant Voice) (33-series).
       5.2.3.4. Communication system listing, outages, and reporting (33-series).
       5.2.3.5. Self Inspection Program (90-series).

       5.2.3.8. Hazardous cargo mission procedures (24-series).
       5.2.3.9. Installations with an airfield will develop OIs for special category mission
       procedures (e.g., CLOSE WATCH, National Airborne Operations Center [NAOC]
       Support, Nuclear Airlift, CLOSE HOLD, Special Operations) (11-series).
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                              39


       5.2.3.10. Security. This OI should address all aspects of security to include physical,
       personnel, industrial, computer, emissions, communications, and operations, as
       applicable (31-series).
       5.2.3.10. (AFSPC) Security. CP will develop a set of OIs to cover local security
       procedures for primary and alternate facilities. These instructions will include as a
       minimum procedures for the receipt and storage of material from transient personnel,
       information security, physical security, operational security (OPSEC) and
       entry/circulation control.
       5.2.3.11. Mobility requirements (10-series).
5.3. Checklists. Checklist use is mandatory. Checklists outline actions to be taken in response
to emergencies, abnormal or recurring circumstances, to implement LERTCON actions (e.g.,
EAMs), or to implement operational order (OPORD) or OPLAN requirements. They will be
brief, concise, and lead controllers through an orderly and prioritized sequence from initiation to
completion. CP managers must review checklists semiannually or immediately after a
procedural change is made to the checklist. Semiannual reviews will be documented on AF
Form 4436, maintained in all checklist (EAC, CBC, QRC) binders. Checklist containing
classified information/formats will be marked and maintained IAW DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-
401.
5.3. (AFSPC)Checklists. Each CP will develop checklists using AFSPC Form 1, Command
Post Checklist, with all blocks completely filled in. Enter the date of the most recent change in
the “Date” block of the AFSPC Form 1. For multi-page checklists, the date will be the same on
all pages. Documentation of the semi-annual review is maintained in front of each checklist
binder. CPs are authorized to use a computer-generated AFSPC Form 1, as long as all fields are
replicated and the bottom left of the form clearly states AFSPC Form 1.
   5.3.1. Checklist Markings. The use of "read a step, do a step, mark a step” checklist
   discipline is required. Controllers will not proceed from one step to the next without
   appropriately marking each step. However, all steps must be annotated appropriately before
   a checklist is considered complete. The following standard markings will be used:
       5.3.1.1. A “√” (check) indicates an action was accomplished.
       5.3.1.2. An “O” indicates an action was initiated but not completed. (Opening a step
       prior to reading/acting on the step is not required.)
       5.3.1.3. An “N” indicates an action does not apply.
       5.3.1.4. A “P” indicates an action was previously accomplished.
       5.3.1.5. An “S” indicates an action was simulated.
   5.3.2. EACs. EACs are developed and maintained IAW applicable EAPs for the receipt,
   validation, and dissemination of HHQ directives.
       5.3.2.1. EACs must be immediately available to controllers for use.
       5.3.2.2. Each CP will have a minimum of two identical EAC binders.
       5.3.2.3. Real world and exercise EACs may be maintained in the same binder; however,
       they will be clearly identifiable as real world or exercise.
40                                                AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013


     5.3.2.4. (Added-AFSPC) AFSPC CPs will not maintain EACs in a binder with other
     types of checklists (i.e., QRCs and CBCs). Annotate EAC completion in the CP daily
     events log.
  5.3.3. CBCs. CBCs address routine recurring subjects that are not time-sensitive in nature,
  including, but not limited to, shift checklists and changeover checklists. A minimum of one
  set of CBCs is required. CBCs will not be intermingled with QRCs. They may be placed in
  the same binder with the QRCs, but will be maintained in a separate section. CBCs will
  include:
     5.3.3.1. Shift Changeover Checklists. Shift changeover checklists are developed and
     maintained to ensure oncoming CP controllers complete all required actions prior to
     assuming duty, including, as a minimum, the following items (as applicable):
         5.3.3.1.1. Review and ensure all CIF items are initialed.
         5.3.3.1.2. Events logs. Review current day and previous logs since controller’s last
         shift.
         5.3.3.1.3. AF Form 1109, Visitor Register Log. Review visitor register log to ensure
         visitor accountability, and account for all visitor badges.
         5.3.3.1.4. Review incoming and outgoing messages.
         5.3.3.1.5. COMSEC material inventory.       Physically identify, inventory, and
         document equipment and systems as required.
     5.3.3.2. Controller Shift Checklists. Shift checklists are developed and maintained to
     ensure controllers complete all required actions throughout their shift, including, as a
     minimum, the following items:
         5.3.3.2.1. Secure voice equipment tests. Accomplish communication checks with
         another unit after each change of keying material or at least weekly for each secure
         voice telephone system (e.g., NATO Secure Voice, Secure Fax. voice over IP
         [VOSIP], DSRN, and Secure Terminal Equipment [STE]) installed in the CP console
         area. Log results in the CP daily events log. Report any discrepancies to the
         appropriate agency and document work order/trouble ticket information on
         communications outage log.
         5.3.3.2.1. (AFSPC) Secure voice equipment tests. Log secure communication
         checks conducted by the AFSPC Command Center in the CP daily events log.
         5.3.3.2.2. INWS tests. Log test completion, results and any deficiencies in the CP
         daily events log. Report any deficiencies to the appropriate agency and document
         work order/trouble ticket information on communications outage log.
         5.3.3.2.3. Daily security checks. Controllers will conduct daily security checks IAW
         AFI 33-201 V2, COMSEC User Requirements, and log the results in the CP daily
         events log. Additionally controllers will annotate actions on the Activity Security
         Checklist, SF 701 and report any discrepancies to the security manager.
         5.3.3.2.4. Emergency lighting test. Conduct weekly functional checks of emergency
         lighting systems and flashlights. Controllers will log results in the CP daily events
         log. Report any discrepancies to the appropriate agency.
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                           41


         5.3.3.2.5. Time standardization. CP clocks will be hacked at least once daily with
         the U.S. Naval Observatory Master Clock (DSN 312-762-1401/Commercial 202-762-
         1401) to within one second. Log time hack results in the CP daily events log.
         5.3.3.2.6. Required reports. List all recurring/routine reports.
         5.3.3.2.7. Housekeeping tasks. List tasks to be accomplished by duty controllers.
         5.3.3.2.8. CP duress alarm test. Test each CP duress alarm activation point weekly.
         Controllers will log results in the CP daily events log. Report any discrepancies to
         the appropriate agency.
     5.3.3.3. End of month COMSEC checklist. The end of month COMSEC checklist is
     developed and maintained to ensure all required COMSEC actions are completed each
     month.
     5.3.3.4. (Added-AFSPC) Daily COMSEC inventory, if applicable.
     5.3.3.5. (Added-AFSPC) Zulu changeover to include closing the events log, opening
     new events log.
  5.3.4. QRCs. QRCs will be structured to save life, protect resources, and rapidly
  disseminate time sensitive information. QRCs will be brief, concise, and lead controllers
  through an orderly and prioritized sequence of actions. QRC automated notifications and
  conferences are authorized and encouraged (e.g., telephone alerting systems, network-centric
  emergency notification systems, INWS).
     5.3.4.1. QRCs must be organized and tabbed to allow controllers to instantaneously
     select appropriate QRC. A minimum of three complete, identical sets of QRCs will be
     maintained: One at each controller position and one for the ACP. An electronic copy of
     the QRCs will be maintained external to the CP, in the event of a catastrophic event that
     prevents proper evacuation of the primary facility. MAJCOMs may authorize the use of
     electronic QRCs; however, paper copies must be maintained in the event of a complete
     power failure/inability to access electronic media.
     5.3.4.1. (AFSPC) Since the 61 ABG/CP is only manned for single controller operations;
     they are only required to maintain two complete sets of QRCs. All units will tab and
     index each set of QRCs by sections for easy reference. When checklist attachments are
     used, they must be referenced in the main body of the checklist with which they are
     associated.
     5.3.4.2. The QRC binder will be conspicuously labeled to identify the contents as QRCs.
     QRC binders will be divided into six standardized sections, to expedite training and
     accessibility. MAJCOMs/Units are authorized to add additional series as needed.
     Deletion of any of the series is not authorized, regardless of mission. The QRC binders
     will include the following, as the minimum:
         5.3.4.2.1. 100 Series – Emergency Management
         5.3.4.2.2. 200 Series - Aircraft/Missiles/Satellites
         5.3.4.2.3. 300 Series - Recalls
         5.3.4.2.4. 400 Series - Security

         5.3.4.2.5. 500 Series - Weather
         5.3.4.2.6. 600 Series - Nuclear Related
         5.3.4.2.7. 700 Series - Miscellaneous
     5.3.4.3. QRC construction. Use the following guidelines when constructing QRCs:
         5.3.4.3.1. Prioritize all checklist steps. Agencies and individuals listed to be
         contacted should be prioritized based on the initial data collected.
         5.3.4.3.2. Only emergency response notifications (e.g., ambulance, fire department,
         security forces) will be made prior to considering/initiating required AF OPREP-3
         actions.
         5.3.4.3.3. Telephone notifications will be limited to essential agencies/personnel
         only. The maximum number of initial notifications per checklist will not exceed ten
         per controller. Pre-built conference calls will count as one notification. Include
         appropriate primary and alternate agency contacts, during duty and non-duty hours,
         when practical.
         5.3.4.3.4. QRCs will include a step indicating CP daily events log entries are
         required, this step usually occurs at the second to the last step of QRCs.
         5.3.4.3.5. QRC steps will refer controllers to Reports Guidebook and/or AFI 10-206,
         when applicable.
         5.3.4.3.6. Incorporate steps addressing AFRCC/RCC notification into applicable
         QRCs.
         5.3.4.3.7. Checklist design will include the following considerations:
            5.3.4.3.7.1. Warnings. Critical information found in checklists that, if not
            followed, could result in mission failure, serious injury, or death.
            5.3.4.3.7.2. Cautions. Serious information that, if not followed, could result in
            mission degradation or equipment damage.
            5.3.4.3.7.3. Notes. Important checklist information that helps explain procedures
            or provide additional information.
            5.3.4.3.7.4. Lead-ins. Statements found in checklists that direct which steps
            should be accomplished in a particular situation; they can also direct the use of a
            different checklist. Lead-ins are usually presented in an “if, then” format and are
            always underlined.
            5.3.4.3.7.5. QRC validation. List the specific reference(s) used to develop the
            checklist in the “reference” block at the bottom of the QRC; using “Local
            Procedures” or “N/A” for a reference is not an authorized option. List the date of
            checklist development or latest change in the “date” block.
  5.3.5. QRC subjects listed in Attachment 5 of this AFI are not all-inclusive. CP managers
  will develop and maintain QRCs based on their unit mission and/or probability of
  occurrence.
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                            43


   5.3.6. Nuclear Surety QRC Review. QRCs relating to Nuclear Surety will be reviewed by
   unit weapons safety personnel annually, IAW AFI 91-101. Safety review will be
   documented on a letter of record or other tracking sheet.
   5.3.7. QRC Changes. CP managers must approve all new checklists, as well as significant
   revisions to existing ones. The Training Manager will ensure all controllers are trained in
   new procedures and significant changes to existing procedures prior to posting. Controllers
   will be advised of checklist changes by CIF. Changes to QRCs relating to Nuclear Surety
   must also be reviewed by unit weapons safety personnel prior to posting.
5.4. CP Daily Events Log. The purpose of the CP daily events log is to serve as an official
continuous record of events affecting the unit or functions of the CP. Because CPs must be able
to reconstruct the events which occur on any given day, events logs will be completed for each
24-hour period.
   5.4.1. All CPs will maintain a CP daily events log using the AF Form 4377, Events Log, or
   other media prescribed by the owning MAJCOM. CPs are authorized to use a computer
   generated (CG) AF Form 4377, as long as all fields are replicated and the bottom left of the
   form clearly states CG AF FORM 4377. CP daily events log will be opened at 0001Z and
   closed at 2359Z; continuous 24-hour logs, whether web-based or not, is authorized at
   MAJCOM discretion.
   5.4.1. (AFSPC) Computer generated events logs will be signed digitally with CAC
   certificates if they are electronically maintained.
   5.4.2. Classifying CP daily events logs. Unclassified CP daily events logs will be marked
   “For Official Use Only” (FOUO); classified logs will be marked according to content.
   5.4.3. Entries to the CP daily events log will be made in chronological sequence using Zulu
   time.
   5.4.4. Events logs for exercises will be maintained separate from real world CP daily events
   logs.
   5.4.5. As a minimum, the CP daily events log will document the following:
       5.4.5.1. All controllers on duty.
       5.4.5.2. Shift checklist/changeover completion.
       5.4.5.3. Significant events and notifications. Entries will include the checklist used and
       actions taken.
       5.4.5.4. Receipt of EAMs (include, as a minimum, originator and date-time-group
       [DTG]).
       5.4.5.5. Changes to unit posture/preparedness.
       5.4.5.6. Any event that requires initiation of a QRC.
       5.4.5.7. Results of communications and equipment checks and/or outages.
       5.4.5.8. Other actions prescribed by this AFI, such as time hacks, emergency light tests,
       secure voice tests, etc.

      5.4.5.9. (Added-AFSPC) All actions taken for AF OPREP-3s and CCIRs. This includes
      checklists used, commander approval, voice message (jabber) up-channeled, all record
      copy messages (SKiWeb) sent and any other items of significance.
      5.4.5.10. (Added-AFSPC) Area security checks.
   5.4.6. CP managers will review the preceding day’s CP daily events log NLT the next duty
   day. The CP manager reviewing the log will annotate the review by placing their initials and
   date in the “reviewed by” block on the AF Form 4377. If MAJCOMs use a different media,
   it must include a location for CP managers to annotate review. Events logs are to be
   maintained as an official record IAW AFI 33-322, Records Management Program.
5.5. CIF Binder. The CIF binder is used to keep CP personnel informed of operational
information such as HHQ policy/guidance, commander’s policy letters, leave and duty
schedules, training requirements, events, etc. The CIF binder will be maintained in the
immediate console area.
   5.5.1. The CIF binder will contain three distinct sections, one for each type of CIF item.
   Types of CIF items include:
      5.5.1.1. Temporary CIF Items. CIF items that are temporary in nature and support
      procedures that are expected to pass or be integrated permanently into checklists, OIs,
      MAJCOM instructions, or moved to Permanent CIF items. Temporary CIF items must
      be integrated, moved, or rescinded within 90 days of issue.
      5.5.1.2. Permanent CIF Items. CIF items that support procedures that are permanent in
      nature and do not fit into checklists, OIs, or MAJCOM instructions. These items either
      originated as permanent items or have been moved from Temporary CIF Items.
      Permanent CIF items are maintained until no longer needed.
      5.5.1.3. C2CIF Items. CIF items are produced by AF/A3O-AC and/or MAJCOM Policy
      and Procedures that support procedural changes impacting the AF/MAJCOM CPs.
      C2CIF items will be retained until rescinded or superseded by the issuing level.
   5.5.2. AF/A3O-AC/MAJCOM C2CIF Program. The C2CIF program ensures important
   information on C2 operations is disseminated in a rapid and formalized manner. C2CIFs
   address a variety of issues such as test programs, interim policies and procedures, SORTS,
   operational reporting, etc. CP managers are responsible for setting up procedures to ensure
   this program is fully implemented at the local level.
      5.5.2.1. Release Authority. AF/A3O-AC/MAJCOM C2 Policy and Procedures.
      5.5.2.1. (AFSPC) Release Authority. HQ AFSPC/A3OP, CP Policy and Procedures, or
      AFSPC/A3O is the releasing authority for AFSPC C2CIFs.
      5.5.2.2. C2CIF Numbering. AF/A3O-AC/MAJCOM C2 Policies and Procedures office
      maintains a master list of C2CIF items released and controls their respective C2CIF
      program. AF/A3O-AC items are identified by the designator “AF”, calendar year (CY),
      and sequence number. As an example, the first AF/A3O-AC originated C2CIF item for
      CY 2011 is coded AF 11-001, the second AF 11-002, and so on. MAJCOM C2CIFs are
      identified by the appropriate MAJCOM acronym, CY, and sequence number. As an
      example, the first Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) C2CIF item for CY 2011 is coded
      AFSPC 11-001, the second AFSPC 11-002, and so on.
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                             45


      5.5.2.3. C2CIF log. A listing of each active C2CIF issued will be identified on a C2CIF
      log. The C2CIF log will contain an assigned C2CIF number, subject/title, rescind date,
      and remarks.
   5.5.3. Unit CIF Program. The CP managers, NCOIC CP Operations, and Training Manager
   are authorized to post Unit CIF items. Items posted by the NCOICs CP Operations or
   Training Manager must be coordinated with CP managers prior to being posted.
      5.5.3.1. Unit CIF Numbering. CIF items are numbered by CY and sequence number.
      For example, 11-017 means the CIF item is the 17th item for the CY 2011.
      5.5.3.2. Unit CIF Logs. A listing of each active CIF assigned to each CIF category will
      be developed. The log will contain an assigned CIF number, title, date and person
      making entry, date and person removing, and remarks.
      5.5.3.3. CIF Disposition. CP managers will conduct a monthly review of the CIF binder;
      reviews will be documented on AF Form 4436, and maintained in the CIF binder. CP
      managers will ensure old material is removed and filed/destroyed as appropriate, and that
      controllers are initialing CIF items IAW 5.5.4.1. Items of continuing value will be
      incorporated into directives, OIs, or filed in the file plan.
      5.5.3.4. (Added-AFSPC) Air Force CP CoP Webpage. All AFSPC CP certified
      controllers will be registered on the SIPRNet Air Force Command Post Career Field
      Community of Practice (CoP) webpage, to readily access C2CIFs.
   5.5.4. Personnel Actions/Responsibilities:
      5.5.4.1. On-coming controllers are required to read and initial all new items prior to
      assuming shift. All day staff personnel must read and initial all new items at least once a
      week, or prior to assuming shift, whichever occurs first.
      5.5.4.2. Upon reading the CIF, controllers place their initials on the corresponding line
      on the CIF log. Initialing the CIF log is an official statement by the controller that the
      CIF has been read and understood.
      5.5.4.3. Upon receipt of a C2CIF message, on-duty controllers will:
          5.5.4.3.1. Log message receipt in the CP daily events log.
          5.5.4.3.2. Take appropriate action as directed by the C2CIF message.
          5.5.4.3.3. File the message sequentially in the appropriate section of the CIF binder.
5.6. Changeover Briefing. CPs will develop a briefing controllers will receive prior to
assuming shift or “sitting in” including, as a minimum, the following items:
   5.6.1. EAM/FPCON/LERTCON/INFOCON status. Address the current alert status, review
   of applicable EAMs, and the status of any open EACs.
   5.6.2. Airfield Status. For units with an operational airfield, address the status of runways,
   taxiways, lighting, Navigational Aids (NAVAID), and aircraft communications.
   5.6.3. Weather Conditions. Cover current and forecasted weather, to include weather
   watches, weather warnings, and other weather conditions that may impact unit mission
   accomplishment.

   safe inventory date and required combination change date as required.
   5.6.13. COMSEC.       List any events concerning COMSEC material/account, i.e.,
   supersessions, compromises.
5.7. CP Displays. CP displays provide controllers, CAT, and EOC all information necessary to
lead, direct, execute, and report the status of all assigned mission resources. Computer generated
displays are preferred; however, CPs must maintain the capability to manually update and
display data in case of system failure. If computer generated, the files must be secured limiting
access only to those who require it. NOTE: TBMCS, GDSS, or unit-developed systems (or
combination of both) may be used to satisfy the requirement. Computer generated displays will
be maintained IAW para 4.1.8 of this instruction.
   5.7.1. Ensure displays are functional in design and are large enough for all personnel who
   need access to see. System inputs/updates must be reflected on all systems simultaneously
   and input at the direction of a competent authority (e.g., CAT coordinator/admin, CP
   controller, EOC director).
   5.7.2. Recommended displays include, but are not limited to:

                                           Chapter 6

                        MISSION MANAGEMENT/MONITORING

6.1. Mission Movement. Execution of the mission is accomplished by controllers performing
pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight coordination, direction, and reporting necessary to ensure
successful mission accomplishment for all tasked missions.
   6.1.1. Mission management is the function of organizing, planning, directing, and
   controlling Combat Air Forces (CAF), Mobility Air Forces (MAF), Special Operations
   Forces (SOF), and training missions operating worldwide. Mission management includes
   mission execution authority, i.e., the authority to direct where and when a mission goes and
   what it does once it arrives. This function is typically performed at the AOC level. An
   example of mission management functions are those performed by the 618 AOC Tanker
   Airlift Control Center (TACC) and 623 AOC (SOF).
       6.1.1.1. Overall C2 mission management of MAF is provided by the NAF AOC that
       tasked the mission (e.g., 618 AOC (TACC) will mission manage 18 AF-tasked missions
       and the 613 AOC will mission manage 13 AF-tasked missions).
   6.1.2. Mission monitoring is the function of organizing, planning, directing (limited), and
   controlling missions operating from or through a location. Mission monitoring does not
   include mission execution.
       6.1.2.1. The CP will mission monitor all locally executed and transient missions IAW
       applicable directives.
   6.1.3. General responsibilities for mission execution. C2 agencies such as the CP, MOC,
   ATOC, AM Ops, etc., are responsible for managing activities surrounding the execution of
   the mission and reporting the status of those activities. CPs will generate and utilize a
   mission Sequence of Events (SOE) tracking mechanism as directed by their MAJCOM.
   Some of these activities include, but are not limited to, monitoring the current maintenance
   status and parking spot of aircraft committed for, or operating missions, and alert/alert
   backup aircraft. Controllers track loading spots and aircraft towing intentions, and, as
   required, accidents/incidents involving aircraft and associated equipment. They also monitor
   the actual times passenger, cargo, and fleet service operations are completed; revisions to
   payload figures; locations of preferred remote parking spots; information concerning any
   hazardous cargo (including that required by AFJI 11-204, Operational Procedures for
   Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials, Department of Transportation [DOT] class and
   division, gross weight, and net explosive weight [NEW]); air transportation data pertaining to
   the required and actual movement of Mission Impaired Capability Awaiting Parts (MICAP)
   and Very, Very Important Parts (VVIP) items; and information concerning sensitive cargo
   and/or passengers (e.g., third country nationals) which may restrict reroutes or diversions or
   require action to comply with the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide; and DV movement
   information. Other responsibilities and functions are based upon specific unit missions.
   6.1.4. Overall C2 of USAF SOF missions is provided by the 623 AOC, Hurlburt Field, FL.
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                            49


   6.1.5. CP controllers must maintain complete situational awareness concerning status and
   location of unit and transient aircraft. Controller situation awareness is instrumental to the
   prevention of and rapid response to instances of aircraft piracy (i.e., hijacking).
      6.1.5.1. IAW AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (HIJACKING),
      commanders are required to immediately notify the NMCC, through CP channels, of any
      suspected or confirmed act of aircraft piracy. A step early in the Aircraft Piracy/Aircraft
      Hijacking QRC must address this requirement.
      6.1.5.2. Controllers must review/understand the Crisis Management Guideline per AFI
      13-207 (Attch 3).
6.2. Aircrew/Mission Support. The aircrew and CP interface is accomplished to provide an
exchange of required mission information.
   6.2.1. CPs will provide information to support aircrew needs as necessary, such as:
      6.2.1.1. Aircraft tail number and call sign.
      6.2.1.2. Aircraft maintenance status.
      6.2.1.3. Aircraft parking spot.
      6.2.1.4. Departure time, route, and mission number.
      6.2.1.5. Fuel load.
      6.2.1.6. Cargo/passenger load.
      6.2.1.7. Advanced Computer Flight Plan (ACFP) (when needed).
      6.2.1.8. Unique mission requirements.
      6.2.1.9. VIP information.
      6.2.1.10. Deadhead crew, additional crewmember (ACM), etc., information.
      6.2.1.11. Itinerary to next crew rest point.
      6.2.1.12. Diplomatic clearance information.
      6.2.1.13. 24-hour access to an aircrew intelligence read file.
      6.2.1.14. Air refueling (A/R) information (e.g., receiver/tanker, mission status, A/R track
      weather, unique A/R radio frequencies).
      6.2.1.15. GDSS Airfield Database (AFD) printout (when needed).
      6.2.1.16. Latest copy of North Atlantic Track (NAT) message (if applicable).
   6.2.2. Coordinate with the Flight Manager, when local events will impact a flight managed
   mission. Conversely, the Flight Manager will coordinate changes to flight managed missions
   with the CP.
   6.2.3. Although not mandatory for all aircrews, CP controllers must be able to direct
   aircrews to information regarding local departure briefings upon request. The CP may also
   be designated by the local commander as a location where aircrews on flight-managed
   missions will receive their aircrew departure papers, containing much of the information in
 50                                                 AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013


   the list above. Controllers can also provide a telephone patch to the most appropriate
   agencies to support aircrews as required.
   6.2.4. Aircraft commanders will ensure they receive applicable information for each mission.
   When requested by the aircraft commander, the CP will provide or arrange for additional
   information or briefings related to such matters as, but not limited to:
      6.2.4.1. Hazardous cargo
      6.2.4.2. Electronic warfare activities
      6.2.4.3. Intelligence/terrorist threat
      6.2.4.4. Diplomatic clearance
   6.2.5. For all en route arrivals, the aircraft commander and ACMs will contact the
   appropriate CP and provide or receive the following information, as applicable:
      6.2.5.1. Stage posture
      6.2.5.2. Legal for alert time/alert window
      6.2.5.3. Crew/ACM orders
      6.2.5.4. Base information handout
   6.2.6. CPs contacted by any aircraft in need of assistance will take action to guarantee safety
   of flight and coordinate assistance requested.
6.3. Originating Mission Setups.
   6.3.1. Not less than 6 hours prior to mission departure, CP will ensure the following agencies
   have entered their information into GDSS, TBMCS, or other MAJCOM approved system for
   each mission departing their station:
      6.3.1.1. Current operations: Mission identifier and schedule.
      6.3.1.2. Applicable flying squadron: AC name and last four digits of social security
      number, squadron, wing, scheduled return time (SRT), call sign, and the breakdown of
      the aircrew (numbers of officers male and female and enlisted male and female).
      6.3.1.3. Maintenance group: Aircraft tail number, aircraft due home date (DHD), and
      parking.
6.4. Special Category Missions. Occasionally, CP controllers manage missions that are
operated with requirements and procedures different from standard missions. These special
category missions may place additional demands on the C2 system above those required for
normal operations.
   6.4.1. CLOSE WATCH. CLOSE WATCH procedures expedite the flow of essential
   mission information up channel to the agency imposing the procedure and ensure designated
   missions receive special attention. CPs will adhere to the following procedures for CLOSE
   WATCH missions:
      6.4.1.1. Mission movement forms, including computer equipment screen faces (e.g.,
      TBMCS, GDSS) used by the CP, will be prominently annotated with the words "CLOSE
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                           51


     WATCH" or the letters "CW" to facilitate the rapid identification of CLOSE WATCH
     missions.
     6.4.1.2. The CP monitoring a Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM) CLOSE
     WATCH mission will ensure the onload and offload contacts (airlift) or receivers (air
     refueling) are promptly notified of delays that affect on time operation of the mission and
     will advise them of the revised scheduling.
     6.4.1.3. PHOENIX BANNER/SILVER/COPPER Missions. (Refer to AFI 11-289,
     Phoenix Banner, Silver, and Copper Operations) PHOENIX BANNER resources consist
     of designated aircraft and certified aircrews that support the President of the United
     States (POTUS). PHOENIX SILVER missions support the Vice President. PHOENIX
     COPPER missions support the Secret Service. These missions have an established
     priority of 1A1 and will be tasked and mission managed as "CLOSE WATCH" missions
     by 618 AOC (TACC). PHOENIX BANNER missions are the highest JCS priority
     missions flown by HQ AMC.
  6.4.2. CLOSE HOLD Missions. AMC operates certain missions that are highly sensitive.
  These missions place an unusual burden on the C2 system, since any facet of the mission
  may require special handling procedures and limited access. The sensitive information may
  include the itinerary, the material being transported, or the unit being supported. By
  identifying a mission as "CLOSE HOLD", HQ AMC limits the access to particular mission
  information and requires modification of certain C2 procedures. Real time mission
  movement reporting WILL NOT be accomplished on CLOSE HOLD missions. Specific
  modifications to normal C2 procedures, when required, are identified in the tasking order
  (mission operating directive, OPORD, etc.).
  6.4.3. PHOENIX PUSH. PHOENIX PUSH is a code name used to designate a mission with
  high-level interest from senior AF and DoD leadership, Congress, or the
  national/international media. PHOENIX PUSH may be designated for an entire mission or a
  particular segment of a mission; the designation may also be added after a mission has
  departed home station. While PHOENIX PUSH missions are CLOSE WATCH/CLOSE
  HOLD missions, they must receive special attention in addition to normal CLOSE
  WATCH/CLOSE HOLD procedures.
     6.4.3.1. Once a mission has been designated as PHOENIX PUSH, the GDSS CLOSE
     WATCH/CLOSE HOLD fields will be annotated, and a remark will be added indicating
     PHOENIX PUSH status.
     6.4.3.2. The PHOENIX PUSH designator mandates expeditious handling of the mission
     at all levels of operations.
     6.4.3.3. CP controllers will keep the 618 AOC (TACC) informed of any unusual actions
     relating to a PHOENIX PUSH mission. This must be done immediately, via the most
     expeditious communications means available, normally telephone. Due to the sensitive
     nature of PHOENIX PUSH missions, an advisory message will not suffice.
  6.4.4. Silent Running. Silent Running operations are designed to permit aircraft movement
  while minimizing the transmission of in-flight data and air/ground communications. They
  will operate within the C2 system and will be designated CLOSE HOLD missions. These
  missions will be preplanned to operate along a specified track or within a planned corridor to
 52                                                  AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013


   minimize conflict with other military missions or civilian air traffic. These procedures may
   be used in the event normal International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) procedures
   become unworkable or undesirable. CPs will not transmit to the aircraft unless:
       6.4.4.1. The aircraft commander requests information.
       6.4.4.2. Emergency situations dictate.
       6.4.4.3. Radio transmissions made at pre-determined times and with pre-determined
       information required by the mission-operating directive.
   6.4.5. Special Operations. While most special operations missions can be executed with
   either normal or CLOSE HOLD procedures, some missions operate outside the scope of the
   normal C2 system. In such cases, CPs will not be provided mission operating directives,
   OPORD, etc. No services will be required or expected from the CP. Special care must be
   exercised to preclude compromising such missions by queries as to the mission/status of the
   aircraft. Such queries will not be made without the specific approval of the commander.
   Special operations aircraft commanders or trusted agents will advise CPs of services
   required.
   6.4.6. Nuclear Airlift Operations. Nuclear airlift missions are all designated as CLOSE
   WATCH. The exact status of each mission is continuously monitored by the appropriate CP
   and the 618 AOC (TACC). Classification of nuclear mission information is governed by the
   USAF Special Weapons Overflight Guide (SWOG), AF Nuclear Weapons Security
   Classification Guide for Nuclear Weapons, mission directives, and nuclear transportation
   technical orders.
       6.4.6.1. Do not use terms that reveal nuclear cargo is on board a specific aircraft,
       mission, or at a specific location. The following guidelines will be used for nuclear airlift
       missions:
           6.4.6.1.1. Do not try to talk around classified information on the radio, telephone, or
           message by substituting terms.
           6.4.6.1.2. When discussing a particular mission, use only the mission number or
           aircraft tail number. References to the mission number and itinerary are unclassified
           in themselves; however, including type of security required, mission priority, cargo
           data, or special regulations that reveal nuclear cargo is involved may be classified.
       6.4.6.2. The 618 AOC (TACC) exercises operational control (OPCON) over all AMC
       nuclear airlift missions.
6.5. Mission Movement Reporting. Real-time mission movement reporting is essential for
effective and responsive global C2.
6.6. Radio Discipline. Radio discipline is essential to mission effectiveness. CPs will ensure
only information essential to mission execution and not available by other means will be
transmitted to, or requested from, airborne aircraft. Every effort will be made to exchange
required information with an aircrew prior to departure or after arrival, and by means other than
radio when possible. CPs will use voice call signs from Voice Call Sign Listing (VCSL) to the
maximum extent to identify military aircraft, organizations, activities, and geographical locations
when establishing and maintaining voice communications.
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                              53


6.7. Hazardous Weather/Runway Conditions. The C2 system must ensure local hazardous
weather and runway condition information is disseminated to appropriate agencies, and
confirmation is received from those agencies when actions have been taken to prevent damage to
AF assets.
   6.7.1. CPs will ensure meteorological watch (METWATCH) advisories, weather warnings,
   and runway surface condition data are received from weather units and AM Ops and
   disseminated to local agencies and departing/arriving aircraft.
   6.7.2. The requirements outlined above are in no way intended to constrain commanders
   from exercising their inherent responsibilities for safety of assigned aircraft, both in-flight,
   and on the ground. Commanders will establish procedures that provide "feedback" through
   the C2 system to indicate METWATCH advisories, weather warnings, and runway surface
   conditions have been disseminated.
6.8. Aircraft Flying DV Personnel. All C2 facilities will notify the AFSWC via Jabber
AF.Watch room of any USAF aircraft carrying the DVs listed below that deviate from their
scheduled itinerary by more than 14 minutes. Report all deviations unless caused by the DV
(e.g., late arrival).
   6.8.1. POTUS/VPOTUS
   6.8.2. SECDEF
   6.8.3. CJCS/VCJCS

                                           Chapter 7

                      TRAINING, TESTING, AND CERTIFICATION

7.1. Training Program Requirements.
   7.1.1. CP training falls into three categories: Initial, recurring, and recertification
   (previously referred to as refresher training.) Units will develop and implement a training
   program for all three categories, using the AF standardized MTP core documents (MTL/AF
   JQS, ATP, and POI) posted on the SIPRNet AFKN website under the “AF Command Post”
   CoP. Instructional System Development (ISD) is the official AF process for training
   personnel and developing instruction materials. To ensure learning activities are based on
   the desired learning outcome, AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional System Development, will be
   used. Other training systems meeting or exceeding the ISD standard may be used in
   conjunction with the ISD, provided the desired learning outcome is achieved. MAJCOMs
   may prescribe ISD training for unit CP Training Managers at their discretion.
   7.1.2. The goal of using ISD or a comparable system is to increase the effectiveness and
   cost-efficiency of education and training by fitting CP training and instructions to the job.
   With ISD, CP training products are constantly evaluated for improvement and quality. Other
   systems must provide an evaluation capability comparable to ISD.
   7.1.3. Prior to performing unsupervised duties, CP personnel will be trained and certified
   IAW this AFI and MAJCOM supplements. Certification equates to qualification.
   Consequently, all CP personnel must be trained, certified, and maintain certification to
   support worldwide deployment requirements.
   7.1.4. Training Manager qualifications are established in Chapter 3 of this AFI.
   7.1.5. All training will be administered by a certified CP controller. Task trainers must have
   completed the AF Training Course and be recommended by their supervisor, with
   documentation in the individual’s AF Form 623A. Training Managers must ensure a copy of
   each task trainer’s AF Training Course certificate/MILPDS printout is in the individual’s AF
   Form 623, Tab six.
   7.1.6. The CP Chief/Superintendent will review the progress of trainees in initial
   certification or recertification training to ensure training remains effective. The review will
   include a detailed description of observations and progress, and will be documented at least
   monthly on the trainee’s AF Form 623A.
7.2. AF 1C3 MTP. The MTP, along with this AFI, contains specific instructions for
documenting and administering the controller training program.
   7.2.1. The AF 1C3 MTP consists of:
      7.2.1.1. MTL/AF JQS
      7.2.1.2. ATP
      7.2.1.3. POIs
      7.2.1.4. Performance standards
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                           55


       7.2.1.5. Examples of completed AF controller training forms, evaluation scenario scripts,
       and self-study letters.
   7.2.2. MAJCOM MTP. MAJCOMs will establish MAJCOM MTP specific requirements.
   7.2.2. (AFSPC) The AFSPC Master Training Plan (MTP) is maintained on the SIPRNet AF
   CP Career Field CoP webpage.
7.3. Unit Training Plan (UTP). The UTP is the AF 1C3 MTP and MAJCOM/FOA/DRU MTP
combined/tailored to meet unit needs. All units will create a UTP tailored to their CP mission.
CP managers will ensure the UTP is used to train personnel during initial, recurring, and
recertification training.
   7.3.1. Units will not deviate from the direction listed below when creating their UTP without
   approval from the AFCFM.
   7.3.2. Tailoring the MTP will be completed by adding unit unique tasks/subtasks to the
   MTL, modifying the ATP to include these new tasks/subtasks, creating a POI for each added
   item, and then updating the performance standards portion of the document.
7.4. MTL/AF JQS.
   7.4.1. The MTL/AF JQS consists of the following phases:
       7.4.1.1. Console Operations (Phase 1)
       7.4.1.2. EA (Phase 2)
       7.4.1.3. Manage Reports Program (Phase 3). Phase 3 is position specific (i.e., AF
       OPREP-3, SORTS, or both). Phase 3 will be trained by an individual already qualified in
       Phase 3 and completed prior to being appointed to the position.
       7.4.1.4. Manage Training Program (Phase 4). Phase 4 is position specific. Phase 4 will
       be trained by an individual already qualified in Phase 4 and completed prior to being
       appointed to the position.
       7.4.1.5. AEF just-in-time training (Phase 5). Phase 5 will be accomplished immediately
       after notification of AEF tasking. Exception: Phase 5 does not need to be accomplished
       if the member attends Theater Mobility Command and Control (TMC2) course.
       7.4.1.6. Once Phase 3, 4, and/or 5 have been completed, place the date of completion
       (each phase) on the individual’s JQS and AF Form 623A.
   7.4.2. Adding. MAJCOM or unit unique tasks will be added to the respective MAJCOM or
   unit AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS. Supplementing
   an AF/MAJCOM task with a unit task on a separate AF Form 797 is authorized (i.e., AF
   7.1.2, U 7.1.2). MAJCOM/Unit unique subtasks will be added to each respective task (block
   1, block 2, etc.), as appropriate.
   7.4.3. Deleting. MAJCOMs/Units are not authorized to delete, waive, or reword tasks from
   the MTL/AF JQS. 100% of all of Phase 1 and 2 tasks must be trained prior to certification.
   7.4.4. Modifying. MAJCOMs maintain authority to modify subtask performance standards
   (e.g. change to knowledge level). CP managers may submit requests to modify subtask
 56                                                 AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013


   performance standards to their MFM for approval. The request must be in writing and
   include the justification for modification.
   7.4.5. All certified controllers will have an AF Form 623 and an AF Form 623A regardless
   of rank and position. Training managers will maintain the individual’s MTL/AF JQS in the
   AF Form 623 until the MTL/AF JQS is no longer needed (e.g., separates, retires). PCSing
   individuals will carry their AF Form 623s to their next duty station so the gaining Training
   Manager can evaluate the individual’s knowledge level. An individual’s MTL/AF JQS will
   be maintained in the AF Form 623, unless classified, in which case it will be stored according
   to its highest classification in a secure area and will not be carried to the next assignment.
   7.4.6. (Added-AFSPC) Waivers. Submit waiver requests IAW Chapter 14.
7.5. ATP.
   7.5.1. Adding. Tasks and subtasks requiring recurring training will be added to the ATP
   within the same block and task that it was added to in the MTL/AF JQS (i.e., AF 7.1.2, U
   7.1.2, AF 7.1.3). CPs will determine the frequency of recurring training for each added
   task/subtask. CPs will identify the subtask by type: Knowledge, Performance, or Both.
   Frequency of required recurring training will be annotated by placing an “X” in the
   respective “month” column of the ATP.
      7.5.1.1. Knowledge. The use of mental processes that enable a person to recall facts,
      identify concepts, apply rules or principles, solve problems, and think creatively.
      Knowledge is obtained through self-study, training meetings, and testing.
      7.5.1.2. Performance. Part of a criterion objective that describes observable controller
      behavior (or the product of that behavior) that is acceptable to the evaluator as proof that
      learning has occurred.
      7.5.1.3. Both. Ability to recall facts, identify concepts, apply rules or principles, and
      demonstrate observable behavior which pertains to the task.
   7.5.2. Deleting. MAJCOMs/CPs are not authorized to delete or reword tasks from the AF
   ATP.
   7.5.3. Modifying. MAJCOMs maintain authority to modify subtask performance standards
   (e.g. change to knowledge level). CP managers may submit requests to modify subtask
   performance standards to their MFM for approval. The request must be in writing and
   include the justification for modification.
   7.5.4. (Added-AFSPC) Waivers. Submit waiver requests IAW Chapter 14.
7.6. POIs.
   7.6.1. Adding. MAJCOMs/CPs will develop a POI for each task/subtask added to the
   MTL/AF JQS. POIs will be added to the respective task/subtasks and will include:
      7.6.1.1. References to specific instructions, manuals, pamphlets, OIs, and QRCs for each
      added task/subtask. Under no circumstance will “local procedures” be used as a
      reference at the unit level.
      7.6.1.2. Training Managers will establish a training/evaluation standard to ensure
      trainee/controller proficiency on the added task/subtask.
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                                57


       7.6.1.3. Learning steps will be added to the task/subtask to ensure trainee receives all
       pertinent information required to accomplish the task/subtask.
   7.6.2. Deleting. MAJCOMs/CPs are not authorized to delete or reword task/subtasks from
   the POIs.
   7.6.3. Modifying. Units are authorized to expand upon existing POIs by adding learning
   steps or updating references.
7.7. Performance Standards.
   7.7.1. Adding. MAJCOMs/CPs will create a performance standard for each added
   task/subtask identified as a “Performance” or “Both” and identify with an “E” on the ATP in
   the month of March or September (or both) when the task/subtask will be evaluated.
   7.7.2. Deleting/Modifying. Deleting and modifying performance standards will follow the
   same guidelines as MTL/AF JQS, ATP, and POI.
   7.7.3. (Added-AFSPC) Waivers. Submit waiver requests IAW Chapter 14.
7.8. Certification Requirements. All officers, enlisted, and civilians assigned to the CP and
performing console duties must meet training, certification, and evaluation requirements as
outlined in this chapter.
   7.8.1. Controller certification signifies the controller has completed initial certification or
   recertification training and is certified in UTP Phases 1 and 2. The certification type
   “Controller” may be preceded by the group, wing, MAJCOM, or combined designation and
   level (e.g., 33 ABG Controller, 54th Wing Controller, CP Controller, AMCC Controller) but
   regardless of how it is annotated, the certification type “Controller” indicates the controller is
   trained and certified on all parts of UTP Phases 1 and 2.
   7.8.2. All certification actions will be documented on AF Form 4374, Command Post/Center
   Controller Certification Record.
7.9. Certification Timelines.
   7.9.1. All controllers will enter initial certification or recertification training within 15
   calendar days of reporting for duty to the CP. Training Manager will conduct an evaluation
   with the trainee within 5 duty days of entering initial certification training to determine the
   tasks to be trained. Document this evaluation on AF Form 623A.
   7.9.2. For Airmen participating in the First Term Airman Center (FTAC) program, the date
   entered training is the first duty day after FTAC completion. If a class date is not available
   within 15 days of date arrived station, initial certification training will begin and an
   annotation in the AF Form 623A will be made detailing the break in training. CP Controllers
   will not participate in any base detail that extends the FTAC program beyond the standard
   AF 2-week period.
   7.9.3. Active duty, full-time ARC, or Traditional Reservist (TR) Command Post controllers
   on 90 consecutive Military Personnel Account (MPA) days will complete initial certification
   or recertification certification training within 90 calendar days from the date entered training
   (120 days for controllers with a NC2 mission). If training goes beyond 90/120 days, the
   MFM must be notified immediately. Actions in this situation will include (as a minimum):
 58                                                   AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013


       7.9.3.1. Approval from the MFM to continue training with an estimated training
       completion date.
       7.9.3.2. Recommendation for removal from the 1C3X1 AFSC based on training history.
       7.9.3.3. Recommendation for administrative separation based on the member’s failure to
       progress.
   7.9.4. Active duty and full-time ARC CP managers will complete initial/recertification
   certification training within 120 calendar days of assuming the position (180 days for CP
   managers with a NC2 mission); if training goes beyond 120/180 days the MFM must be
   notified immediately. Actions in this situation will include (as a minimum):
       7.9.4.1. Approval from the MFM to continue training with an estimated training
       completion date.
       7.9.4.2. Recommendation for removal from the 1C3X1 AFSC based on training history.
       7.9.4.3. Recommendation for administrative separation based on the member’s failure to
       progress.
   7.9.5. Traditional ARC CP controllers will be certified within one year of reporting for duty.
   Certification will be accomplished IAW this AFI and applicable MAJCOM supplements.
   Traditional ARC controllers in 8010 units will be certified within 18 months or 120 duty
   days, whichever comes first.
   7.9.6. Personnel at OPLAN 8010 units awaiting a TS clearance will begin training in areas
   not requiring a TS clearance; however, these personnel will not be certified until an interim
   or final TS clearance is attained and they have completed the TS portions of training.
   7.9.7. Personnel previously certified at their assigned unit, but decertified for any reason
   (TDY, convalescent leave, failures, etc.), will be recertified within 30 calendar days (45
   calendar days for OPLAN 8010/NSNF committed units) of returning to duty.
7.10. Initial Certification Training.
   7.10.1. CP controllers without CP console experience within the past 2 years will receive
   initial certification training. Initial certification training will encompass all areas in Phase 1
   and Phase 2 of the AF/MAJCOM MTP and UTP.
   7.10.2. Initial certification training provides controllers with the knowledge and skills
   necessary to perform duties effectively at home station or in a deployed environment.
   During initial certification training, personnel will accomplish all training requirements
   identified in the UTP for the certification area being trained.
   7.10.3. Block Test. During initial certification training, the trainee upon completing each
   block of the UTP in Phase 1 and 2, will be administered an open book written examination
   containing a minimum of 10 questions and/or a performance evaluation encompassing
   “knowledge”, “performance”, and “both” tasks/subtask. Units with only one block of
   training for Phase 2 are not required to administer a block test (Phase and certification test
   will sufficiently cover material and avoid redundancy in this situation). Block exam scores
   and evaluation ratings will be documented on the individual’s AF Form 623A.
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                               59


   7.10.4. Phase Tests. After completing each phase (1 and 2) the trainee will be administered
   a multiple-choice written examination. Each phase will have a separate exam, will be open
   book, and will consist of a minimum of 30 questions. The minimum passing score for all
   phase written examinations is 90% (critiqued to 100%). Phase exam scores and evaluation
   rating will be documented on the individual’s AF Form 623A and AF Form 4374. Phase
   exams must be completed prior to being administered a multiple-choice written exam for
   certification.
   7.10.5. Certification Test. Certification test will be accomplished IAW 7.13.3.1.
   7.10.6. UGT. Controllers entered into initial certification training are also required to be
   entered into UGT using the 1C3 CFETP, IAW AFI 36-2201. Training Managers/Supervisors
   will open Specialty Training Standard (STS) task when the controller begins training on that
   applicable STS task. STS tasks will not be signed off as complete until the controller has
   demonstrated that they have achieved the required knowledge level of the STS task. STS
   task do not need to be signed off in order for a controller to be certified.
7.11. Recertification Training. Recertification training is a condensed version of initial
certification training. It is designed to teach controllers, with prior CP experience (within the
past 2 years), local procedures and command unique mission requirements. It is also used to
recertify controllers who have not performed CP duties for a period of 60 or more calendar days
in their respective command. Controllers will be entered into recertification training for the
following reasons: PCS, TDY, and decertification for cause.
7.11. (AFSPC)Recertification Training. The Superintendent and NCOIC, Training will
interview the trainee and review the training records to determine the level of recertification
training required. The training manager will develop the exact content of refresher training
based on local task requirements, controller’s previous experience, and currency of duties
performed.
   7.11.1. PCS. Controllers PCSing into a unit with recent CP experience (within the last 2
   years) will be entered into recertification training. Trainees will receive initial certification
   training on command/unit specific tasks not previously trained as well as recertification
   training on tasks that have been trained previously but require unit mission/system
   familiarity. The time the controller spends in recertification training will be determined by
   the Training Manager, after an interview to determine their individual needs (not to exceed
   time criteria in para 7.9. of this AFI). AF Form 4374, page 1, will always be completed upon
   the first certification approval at the new PCS location.
   7.11.2. TDY. Controllers who have not performed CP duties for a period of 60 or more
   calendar days within their respective command will be entered into recertification training.
   The individual requirements for the controller will be determined from the results of an
   interview by the Training Manager (not to exceed time criteria in para 7.9.7. of this AFI).
   7.11.3. Decertification for cause. Controllers decertified IAW para 7.14. of this AFI will be
   entered into recertification training. The individual requirements for the controller will be
   determined from the results of an interview by CP managers or the Training Manager (not to
   exceed time criteria in para 7.9.7. of this AFI).
   7.11.4. Recertification Test. Recertification test will be accomplished IAW 7.13.3.1.

7.12. Recurring Training. The purpose of recurring training is to ensure CP controllers remain
qualified in all areas pertaining to their unit’s mission. This training is based on the requirements
established in the AF/MAJCOM/Unit ATP. Training Managers will cover tasks on the ATP
through a combination of training meetings, self-study, and proficiency training. 100% coverage
of all subtasks identified on the ATP for that month will be documented on the self-study letter.
   7.12.1. Training meetings will be conducted in a classroom environment and occur a
   minimum of once per quarter. Specific requirements will be outlined in MAJCOM
   supplements.

           for the period (month/quarter) covered by the training meeting will be documented on
           the monthly self-study letter(s).
           7.12.1.1.2. (Added-AFSPC) Administrative,           general     interest  items      (i.e.,
           commander’s call), support agencies training (i.e., SFS, space/launch operations,
           etc.), and training items identified in the UTP, but not required for that specific
           month, may be covered but will not count towards the required three hours of formal
           training unless it is an identified task on the ATP for the period covered or it is added
           to the applicable self-study letter.
           7.12.1.1.3. (Added-AFSPC) AF Form 4371, Record of Controller Formal Training,
           must be detailed enough for those reviewing the minutes to understand the substance
           of what was briefed.
           7.12.1.1.4. (Added-AFSPC) All meeting minutes will include the name of each
           briefer, topics covered by each briefer, MTL/ATP task coverage, duration of each

           include trip highlights and tie-in to the current month’s MTL/ATP topics.
           7.12.1.1.6. (Added-AFSPC) To aid in reconstruction of the training meeting, audio
           and/or video recordings are authorized but must be classified according to content and
           controlled IAW applicable security guidance.
           7.12.1.1.7. (Added-AFSPC) Training meeting minutes will be posted in the CIF
           within 24 hours of the training meeting.
           7.12.1.1.8. (Added-AFSPC) AF Form 4371, Record of Controller Formal Training,
           will be filed in the Training Binder and maintained for two years.
       7.12.1.2. All CP controllers must attend the CP training meetings, unless excused by CP
       managers. Training Managers will ensure all personnel not present at the training
       meeting receive training NLT 5 calendar days after returning to duty.
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                           61


     7.12.1.2. (AFSPC) CP controllers (except personnel who are TDY/deployed/on leave)
     will not miss two or more consecutive training meetings. CP managers will use caution
     when scheduling training meetings to ensure the same individuals do not miss
     consecutive meetings due to shift schedules.
  7.12.2. Self-Study. The Training Manager will create a monthly self-study letter outlining
  that month’s training requirements based on the ATP. The self-study letter will be signed by
  the CP Chief or Superintendent and detail the task/subtask areas to be studied/reviewed by all
  personnel. Personnel will thoroughly review all identified requirements, to include each
  learning step within the POI of the identified task/subtask. CP managers will ensure
  supervisors are involved with helping subordinates complete and understand self-study
  requirements. The self-study letter will be published NLT the first day of each month. The
  self-study letter will be retained in the CIF until superseded. When removed, it will be
  maintained in the Training Binder, Section I for 12 months.
     7.12.2.1. As a minimum, the self-study letter will contain the following information:
         7.12.2.1.1. When applicable, the agenda for the training meeting, (briefings, lectures,
         guest speakers, etc.).
         7.12.2.1.2. The task/subtask areas to be studied/reviewed (self-study) by all CP
         personnel.
         7.12.2.1.3. The performance evaluation or scenario training schedule for the month,
         if applicable.
         7.12.2.1.4. New/Revised publication and checklists.
         7.12.2.1.5. Areas that require extra study.
  7.12.3. Proficiency Training. Proficiency training consists of monthly written exams (EA
  and general knowledge), and monthly performance evaluation or scenario training.
     7.12.3.1. Monthly Examinations. A 90% score (critiqued to 100%) is required to pass
     monthly written examinations. Personnel failing to achieve a passing score are required
     to be retrained in deficient areas (missed subtask areas) and must be retested within 5
     duty days (for ARC personnel, training will occur prior to the next monthly examination).
     Monthly examination scores will be documented on the AF Form 4372.
         7.12.3.1.1. Active duty/full time ARC members failing to pass the monthly
         examinations will be required to complete a minimum of 12 hours of
         remedial/supplemental training. ARC members will follow MAJCOM guidance.
         This training will be documented in the individual’s training records, to include the
         AF Form 623A.
         7.12.3.1.2. Training Managers will ensure controller training materials (tests,
         scenarios, evaluations) are properly controlled to prevent compromise or disclosure.
         Paper or electronic copies of the master will be retained for 12 months from the end
         of the month they cover. Ensure electronic copies are archived on an authorized
         recordable device (e.g., CD or external drive) at least quarterly.
             7.12.3.1.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) NCOIC, Training will maintain copies of all
             monthly (EA, GKT), phase, certification exams, training scenarios and
62                                                AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013


            evaluations for 12 months.
            7.12.3.1.2.2. (Added-AFSPC) Retests will include areas of weakness and the
            areas missed on the original test. Retraining and retesting actions will be
            documented in the individual’s AF Form 623A, Individual Training Record
            Folder in addition to the AF Form 4372 documentation.
        7.12.3.1.3. General Knowledge Examination. All personnel will be administered a
        monthly “General Knowledge” open-book written examination covering the
        “Knowledge” and “Both” based task/subtasks derived from Phase 1 and identified on
        the ATP for that month. This examination will consist of at least 30 questions.
        7.12.3.1.3. (AFSPC) General Knowledge Examination. If General Knowledge
        Examinations (GKE) are not built by the training managers, then one of the training
        managers is required to take the GKE prior to administering the tests to controllers to
        resolve any discrepancies. The individual who builds the GKE will be the only
        certified individual exempt from taking the examination for that month.
        7.12.3.1.4. Emergency Actions Examination. All personnel certified at locations that
        process EA will be administered a monthly closed-book written examination covering
        “Knowledge” and “Both” based subtasks derived from Phase 2 and identified on the
        ATP for that month. This examination will consist of at least 30 questions.
            7.12.3.1.4.1. COCOM EAP examinations will be administered IAW governing
            procedures specified by the COCOM for that unit. If COCOM EAPs do not
            dictate specific examination requirements, a minimum of 30 questions and a
            minimum passing score of 90% will be required.
            7.12.3.1.4.1. (AFSPC) The individual who builds the EA examination will be
            exempt from taking the EA examination for that month.
     7.12.3.2. Scenario Training. All certified personnel will be administered monthly
     training scenario (except during evaluation months) covering “Performance” and “Both”
     based task/subtasks identified on the ATP. Scenario training scripts will contain a
     minimum of three situations, and progressive in nature when possible. At a minimum,
     each training scenario will include an emergency management situation, processing of
     two EAMs, and creation/submission of an AF OPREP-3. Following each situation, a
     minimum of four discussion questions (pertaining to the situation) will be administered to
     the trainee. Scenario training is not graded, but rather used as a learning tool for
     controller performance proficiency. On the AF Form 4372, Record of Controller
     Recurring Training, annotate the date of the training scenario. Scenarios will not be
     conducted on the console.
        7.12.3.2.1. A HHQ or locally evaluated exercise can satisfy all or some of the
        scenario training requirements.     Training Managers must determine which
        task/subtasks were performed and whether they meet the standards.
        7.12.3.2.1. (AFSPC) If a HHQ or locally evaluated exercise is used to satisfy all, or
        portions, of the scenario training, the NCOIC, Training (or alternate) must be present
        during the entire portion of the exercise that is being assessed. This ensures the
        training manager is able to assess and train controllers properly. A HHQ or locally
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                                63


         evaluated exercise can only be used to satisfy scenario training requirements for the
         controllers on duty at the time of the exercise; all other controllers are still required to
         complete the scenario training.
         7.12.3.2.2. Paper or electronic copies of the master performance scenario scripts will
         be retained for 12 months from the end of the month they cover.
     7.12.3.3. Performance Evaluations. All certified personnel will be administered a
     semiannual performance evaluation covering “Performance” and “Both” based subtasks
     identified on the ATP. Semiannual performance evaluations will be administered during
     March and September each year. Performance evaluation scripts will contain a minimum
     of five situations and progressive in nature when possible. Evaluations will not be
     conducted on the console.
         7.12.3.3.1. All performance evaluations will be rated either “SAT” or “UNSAT” and
         documented on the AF Form 4372.
         7.12.3.3.2. An evaluation is rated as “SAT” if the controller completes all of the
         tasks within the number of allowable “assists” or “errors” identified in the
         Performance Standards portion of the MTP.
         7.12.3.3.2. (AFSPC) An “assist” is when a controller is unable to perform an action
         or find the reference on how to perform an action without direction from the
         instructor/evaluator. An “error” is defined as an action by an evaluated controller that
         does not complete the task(s) IAW procedures and/or checklists.
         7.12.3.3.3. An evaluation is rated as “UNSAT” if the controller exceeds the
         allowable number of “assists” or “errors” for an evaluated task identified in the
         Performance Standards. If an “UNSAT” is received, the Training Manager will
         document the rating and identify the task(s) that were not proficiently performed on
         AF Form 4372, and prepare the AF Form 4374 for the certifying official(s) to
         decertify the controller for failing to meet certification standards IAW 7.14.1.3.
         Decertification actions will be documented on an individual’s AF Form 623A.
         7.12.3.3.4. CP managers will ensure personnel receiving an “UNSAT” rating on
         performance evaluations are trained in deficient areas (missed subtask areas).
         Controllers receiving an “UNSAT” will be retrained and reevaluated on deficient
         areas within 10 calendar days of the initial performance evaluation and provide the
         certification official with a recommendation for recertification. These actions will be
         documented on an AF Form 623A.
         7.12.3.3.5. OPLAN 8010 EA Performance Evaluations. OPLAN 8010 units will also
         comply with additional evaluation/scenario training requirements as outlined in
         applicable EAP volumes.
  7.12.4. Missed Training.
     7.12.4.1. Active Duty/Full Time ARC Personnel.
         7.12.4.1.1. All certified controllers absent from duty for 60 days or more within their
         respective command, will be decertified and entered into recertification training when
         returned to duty. Decertification and recertification will be documented IAW this
         chapter.

          7.12.4.1.2. All personnel absent from duty for 59 days or less will review and make
          up all missed training not accomplished, i.e., training meetings, examinations,
          training scenarios, performance evaluations, etc., within ten calendar days of
          returning to duty. Training Managers will ensure personnel are briefed on all
          procedural changes and/or significant events that occurred during their absence.
       7.12.4.2. Traditional Reservist (TR) Personnel:
          7.12.4.2.1. TR personnel that miss monthly training, will review the C2CIF, and
          make up all missed training. Supervisors or Training Managers will ensure personnel
          are briefed on all procedural changes and/or significant events that occurred during
          their absence. This training must be accomplished prior to assuming duty.
          7.12.4.2.2. TR personnel who miss two or more consecutive Unit Training Assembly
          (UTA) weekends will be decertified and entered into recertification training upon
          returning to duty. Prior to returning to duty, personnel will be recertified.
          Decertification and recertification will be documented IAW this chapter.
7.13. Certification. Certifying official(s) must sign the CP controller’s AF Form 4374. At the
MAJCOM level, the certifying official is the MAJCOM Commander; this duty will not be
delegated below the MAJCOM Director of Operations (A3) or designated representative. At the
installation level, the installation commander or designated representative is the certifying
official(s); this authority will not be delegated below the vice installation commander or
comparable position. CP personnel assigned below installation level, such as a Contingency
Response Group (CRG) or Air Mobility Squadron (AMS) will be certified by the commander;
this authority will not be delegated below the deputy commander or comparable position. The
certifying official(s) must conduct a personal interview with each CP controller prior to
certification. For Consolidated CP/ CP Association, refer to para 7.18.
   7.13.1. Certification       is    accomplished   following      successful     completion     of
   initial/recertification training.
   7.13.2. Certification provides a consistent standard against which personnel are evaluated
   and serves to quickly determine who has the necessary skills and knowledge for the job. All
   CP personnel must be certified prior to performing unsupervised controller duties.
   Certification must be maintained by completion of all recurring training requirements.
   Failure to maintain established certification standards will result in immediate decertification.
   7.13.3. CP managers will ensure personnel have been trained and are proficient on all
   tasks/subtasks required for certification. Certification criteria consists of the following:
       7.13.3.1. Certification tests will be a minimum of 30 questions covering tasks from
       Phase 1 and a minimum of 30 questions covering tasks from Phase 2. A 90% passing
       score is required, and failures will result in remedial training of the tasks that were
       missed.
       7.13.3.2. The certification performance evaluation will be conducted in the same manner
       as identified in para 7.12.3.3. of this AFI. The certification performance evaluation script
       will not be the same script used for the semiannual performance evaluations.
   7.13.4. Results of the certification tests and certification performance evaluation will be
   recorded on the AF Form 4372 and AF Form 4374.
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                              65


   7.13.5. After the certifying official(s) has interviewed the controller and determined they are
   fully qualified, the certifying official(s) will sign and date the AF Form 4374.
   7.13.6. Certification date will be documented on the individual’s AF Form 623A.
   7.13.7. An AF Form 4374 will be maintained on each certified controller until the controller
   PCSs/PCAs (until arrival at new duty station), separates, or retires from his/her assigned unit.
   A change in the certifying official(s) does not result in a requirement to accomplish new
   certification documents.
   7.13.8. Personnel in OPLAN 8010 committed units are required to have access to NC2 –
   Extremely Sensitive Information (NC2-ESI) materials prior to certification. IAW CJCSI
   3231.01B, Safeguarding Nuclear Command and Control Extremely Sensitive Information,
   wing commanders may grant NC2-ESI access to persons assigned to positions requiring
   permanent access to NC2-ESI materials. Access can be granted once an interim TS
   clearance is obtained and the requirements of CJCSI 3231.01B are met. CP managers will
   ensure that two interim TS certified controllers are not on duty at the same time.
   7.13.9. If a controller fails to certify within the required time frame, CP managers will notify
   CFM through their MFM of the reason for delay and the estimated certification date. A copy
   of this notification will be filed in Tab 7 of the individual's AF Form 623 and documented on
   the AF Form 623A.
7.14. Controller Decertification/Recertification. CP managers will ensure personnel remain
proficient in all certification areas, take immediate action to correct deficiencies, and remove
personnel found not suitable for CP duty. Controllers who have been decertified for substandard
performance two times or more within a 6-month period will be evaluated by CP managers and
certifying official(s) for removal from the 1C3X1 AFSC. Controllers who have been decertified
for substandard performance three times within a 6-month period will be removed from the
1C3X1 AFSC IAW with the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD). All
reassignment, retraining, or discharge actions due to training deficiencies will be coordinated
with the MFM and submitted through the local Force Support Squadron.
7.14. (AFSPC)Controller Decertification/Recertification. CP Managers will notify AFSPC
1C3 Functional Manager via email of all reassignment, retraining, or discharge actions due to
training deficiencies and courtesy HQ AFSPC/A3OP CP Policy and Procedures.
   7.14.1. Decertification. Decertification will be signed by the certification authority for items
   that are listed below. Personnel will be decertified for several reasons, to include:
       7.14.1.1. Extended periods of absence IAW para 7.11.2. of this AFI.
       7.14.1.2. Failure to maintain proficiency standards, to include failing two EA exams (to
       include HHQ exams) within a 6-month period, or receiving an “UNSAT” on a
       performance evaluation.
       7.14.1.2. (AFSPC) If the controller receives a second test failure during an IG/SAV
       exam in a 6 month period then decertification will occur on the same duty day and the
       controller will be placed into a minimum of 12 hours of remedial/supplemental training.
       7.14.1.3. Security clearance withdrawal.
 66                                                 AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013


      7.14.1.4. AEF Deployments. Controllers will be decertified when tasked to deploy for
      60 days or longer. Decertification must be documented within 30 days of departure from
      home station.
   7.14.2. Recertification. The CP Chief is authorized to recertify controllers who are absent
   for 60 days or more, performing command post related duties. All other certification actions
   are the responsibility of the certifying official(s). NOTE: CP Superintendent (regardless if
   CP Chief is assigned/available) are not authorized to recertify controllers absent for 60 days
   or more.
   7.14.3. The AF Form 4374 will be used to decertify and recertify controllers.
      7.14.3.1. Following completion of recertification training, the Training Manager will
      document review in the appropriate spaces on the AF Form 4374 and forward to CP
      managers for further review. CP managers will review the trainee’s progress and
      document review in the appropriate area. Signatures of the Training Manager and a CP
      manager indicate “recommend for recertification” to the certifying official(s).
      7.14.3.2. The certifying official(s) interviews the controller and if the member is found to
      be qualified, the certifying official(s) signs and dates the AF Form 4374.
      7.14.3.3. Decertification and recertification actions (i.e., supplemental training provided,
      scores, etc.) will be documented on the individual’s AF Form 623A.
7.15. Training Binder Requirements. The following training documentation will be
maintained in a Training Binder. The binder will be divided into four sections:

       examination will result in consideration for decertification. CP Managers will propose
       recommendations to the certifying official. Documentation of the EA exam failure and
       recommendation will be annotated on the AF Form 623A.
       7.17.3.2. (Added-AFSPC) If the decision is made to decertify the controller, the
       controller must be decertified that same day.
       7.17.3.3. (Added-AFSPC) Regardless if the controller maintains certification after
       failing an IG administered test, any controller failing a SAV or IG administered closed-
       book EA examination is required to complete a minimum of 12 hours of
       remedial/supplemental training. Retesting by the controller must be accomplished no
       later than 3 duty days after the failure. Document training on the AF Form 623A.
       7.17.3.4. (Added-AFSPC) Any failure of an IG/SAV EA Exam will be documented on
       the AF Form 623A and AF Form 4372.
7.18. Training of Certified Controllers in Consolidated CP/ CP Association. Controllers
assigned to a Consolidated CP/ CP Association will be entered into a training program created by
the Consolidated CP/ CP Association Training Managers, to ensure all aspects of the installation
mission can be supported.
   7.18.1. For Consolidated CP/ CP Association, AF Form 4374s will be signed by all
   applicable Wing Commanders with 1C3 personnel assigned to perform duties, for the
   Consolidated CP/ CP Association.
   7.18.2. When required, controllers will attend mandated C2 courses (e.g., JNC2) to meet
   Consolidated CP/ CP Association training requirements.
   7.18.3. CP managers should work with the applicable MAJCOM’s CP Policy and
   Procedures branches to determine additional training requirements.

                                           Chapter 8

                               FACILITY REQUIREMENTS

8.1. General. This chapter outlines the minimum facility requirements for CPs.
   8.1.1. The working area for a CP is based on the functions performed and maximum number
   of personnel required to perform the tasks during peak periods. CP managers will ensure the
   CP facility meets standards in UFC 4-010-01 DoD, Unified Facility Criteria; AFH 32-1084,
   Facility Requirements; AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense; and AFI 10-2501, Air Force
   Emergency Management Program Planning & Operations.
   8.1.2. When selecting a facility for the CP, commanders must consider survivability in a
   CBRN environment, as well as its ability to provide protection against threats IAW AFI 10-
   2501.
   8.1.3. Commanders are not required to modify an existing CP to meet the specifics of this
   instruction, unless the CP is unable to support the unit’s mission. However, all programmed
   modification/renovation must meet the criteria of this AFI.
8.2. Construction Requirements.
   8.2.1. Structure. The EA cell/console area will be physically separated from the remainder
   of the CP by a locking door (and windows, if applicable) to limit access during EAM
   processing.
   8.2.2. Outer Door. The CP will have a primary external entrance door. The door will be of
   a construction type and installation that assures appropriate security IAW AFI 31-101, and it
   will be equipped with a mechanical or electronically operated cipher lock. The outer door
   can be either solid construction (if no inner door installed) or heavy metal-wire mesh (if inner
   door installed). If equipped with a key lock system, it will only be for emergency use. Strict
   safeguards must be incorporated to ensure keys are used for emergency purposes only.
   8.2.3. Inner Door. The inner entrance door (if installed) must be of solid construction,
   except for a reinforced window or peephole and securable credentials slot. Solid wood
   constructed doors will be reinforced externally with a steel sheet cover to prevent removal of
   the door. Ensure each external pin, bolt, screw, or other fastening device is protected to
   prevent removal. Doorframes shall be compatible with both the strength of the door and the
   adjoining wall construction IAW AFI 31-101.
   8.2.4. EA Cell/Console Area. Wall and ceiling silencing materials (or other means of noise
   reduction) should be used to keep noise levels to a minimum. The CP will have a raised,
   pedestal-style floor or dropped ceiling, in order to accommodate cableways. Ceilings and
   floors will be constructed with adequate security safeguards. All efforts should be made to
   ensure that communications and electrical supply cableway, ducts, and associated outlets are
   constructed in the floors, walls, and ceiling, to assure complete coverage and flexibility for
   additional needs and for ease of access and servicing. When the CP and the supporting areas
   (CAT, EOC, etc.) are located adjacent to each other, they will be physically separated by a
   securable means that facilitates message transfer (e.g., a small pass through door which is
   securable from the CP side).
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                                69


8.3. Facility Requirements.
   8.3.1. Emergency Power. All CPs shall have an Emergency Generator system and an
   Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) as authorized by and IAW AFI 32-1063 and AFH 32-
   1084. The generator system shall be designed to support the maximum CP operating load
   and be capable of both manual and automatic operation to start and stop the generator and to
   transfer load. The UPS system shall be installed and capable of supporting all mission
   critical equipment. The ACP emergency generator system and UPS shall be afforded the
   same protection standards as the CP.
   8.3.2. Emergency Lighting. At a minimum the CP console area must be equipped with
   emergency lighting (i.e., battery-powered lighting) with a weekly functional test conducted
   and logged in the events log.
      8.3.2.1. The CP will augment the emergency lighting system with flashlights (to include
      spare batteries and bulbs), to permit continued safe occupancy for at least 2 hours after a
      complete power loss or the length of time required to evacuate.
      8.3.2.2. At locations with TPC material, the emergency lighting will be focused on TPC
      material safes, or the entire area will be lighted, to ensure control can be maintained until
      material is secured.
   8.3.3. Locks. Each door of the standoff area will be equipped with an electronic door lock.
   Locks must provide remote unlocking capabilities from the EA console; local unlocking by
   cipher pad, shielded push button unlocking and key on the exterior side of the door or door
   frame. Electronic locks must be configured so only one door is open at any time (to include
   remote unlocking from the EA consoles). In the event of failure, electronic locks should fail
   in the locked position and have a manual override to allow for emergency egress. If locks
   fail in the open position a manual locking system must be installed to prohibit unauthorized
   entry. Cipher locks are authorized for use on CP inner and outer doors. Inner and outer
   doors will not have the same combination. Cipher locks are also authorized for EA
   cell/console area doors. Cipher lock combinations will be changed annually (as a minimum),
   when the combination is compromised, when personnel PCS/PCA/retire, or when a person
   having access is permanently decertified or has lost/temporarily lost their security clearance.
   8.3.4. Closed-Circuit Television. If the CP entrance is located where controllers would have
   to leave the console to perform personal identification, a closed-circuit television system
   must be installed. If this system is not available, one-way glass must be installed.
   8.3.5. EAM Processing Light and Written Instructions. A light will be placed outside the
   EA cell/console area and outside the standoff area, adjacent to the entrance phone or outer
   door of CP. The light will be activated from within the EA cell/console area when on-duty
   controllers are processing EA traffic. A sign will be placed with written instructions (in
   English and host nation language, if applicable) next to the phone, detailing entry procedures
   when the EAM processing light is activated.
   8.3.6. Telephone. A telephone will be mounted on the exterior of the standoff area next to
   the outer door. It should provide a direct line (hotline or speed dial) to the console. If hotline
   or speed dial is not available, CP Managers will post phone numbers and instructions for
   dialing console controllers.
 70                                                 AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013


   8.3.7. Ventilation. The CP will have air conditioning and heating that is controlled from
   inside the CP, when feasible/possible. The CP may have a HVAC Emergency Shutdown
   pushbutton within the CP for use in the event of a chemical or biological hazard. All
   ventilation and access openings will be constructed with security safeguards.
   8.3.8. EA Cell/Console Area. The EA cell/console area door must allow for visual
   identification of personnel requesting entry and for rapid emergency exit from the cell. All
   transparent partitions or windows in the EA cell/console area must have drapes, blinds, or
   one-way glass to secure the cell during EAM processing. Whatever the method used, it must
   prevent direct or indirect visibility of the EA cell/console area.
8.4. Facility Layout.
   8.4.1. EA Cell/Console Area. The EA cell/console area is normally one and the same. A
   separate space to process EA physically separated from the console area is not required,
   unless otherwise unable to meet the requirements of this paragraph. CP managers will ensure
   the EA cell/console area is a secure area within the facility to process EA. The EA
   cell/console area must have adequate space for day-to-day operations and also for additional
   personnel during contingency operations. The EA cell/console area must be constructed and
   equipped to accomplish the required duties. Additionally, it must be fitted with a duress
   capability terminating at the Security Forces Control Center (SFCC)/Base Defense
   Operations Center (BDOC). MAJCOMs may specify units where the EA cell and console
   area are physically separated from one another in order to preserve synergy with lateral C2
   agencies (e.g., CPs collocated with MOC and or ATOC controllers, where employment of
   other methods of isolation such as windows, shades, or sliding doors are not practical).
   8.4.1. (AFSPC) EA Cell/Console Area. The duress alarm system must provide for separate
   alarm activation from each controller position (includes entry controller position when
   manned).
   8.4.2. CP Manager and Administrative Area. An area within the confines of the CP facility
   will be reserved for the Chief, Superintendent, and the administrative staff with adequate
   office space to accommodate the number of personnel and any equipment necessary to
   perform their day-to-day duties. Privacy and close proximity to the console area are key
   considerations for the administrative area. The area will have workspace, seats, standard
   office equipment, and file storage.
   8.4.3. Training Area. An area within the confines of the CP facility will be reserved for the
   training area, with easy access to the console area, to facilitate training and testing of
   controllers. The area will have a dedicated console simulator (to train scenarios and evaluate
   currency), workspace, seats, standard office equipment, safes, and file storage. The training
   area will have adequate office space to accommodate the number of personnel and any
   equipment necessary to perform their day-to-day duties. The key considerations for
   determining where to locate a dedicated training room are: Assure privacy to conduct
   classified training up to and including TS or Secret (depending on mission) and close
   proximity to the console area.
   8.4.4. CAT Area. To ensure a good cross flow of information, a collocated CAT area is
   highly recommended. If not possible due to space limitations, secure communications (e.g.,
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                            71


   dedicated phones, visual displays) must exist between the CP and CAT to ensure effective
   coordination.
   8.4.4. (AFSPC) CAT Area. Ensure that procedures are developed that provide for efficient
   and effective communications flow between the CAT and controllers. It is imperative to the
   mission that both the controllers and the CAT members are kept informed of all events that
   take place during the exercise and/or real world situations.
   8.4.5. Frame Room. The CP will have a room physically separated from the rest of the CP
   by fixed walls and a locking door (to hold the telephone switch frame), remote satellite
   communications (SATCOM) equipment, assorted radio cabinets, and COMSEC equipment,
   as applicable. The preferred location for the frame room is within the CP secure area. Frame
   rooms located outside the CP area must be identified, secured, and treated as the same
   protection level (PL) as the CP.
   8.4.6. Other CP Areas.
       8.4.6.1. Kitchen. CP managers will ensure controllers have proper food preparation
       equipment, food storage equipment (e.g., refrigerator and microwave), and a sink within
       the CP.
       8.4.6.2. Restrooms. CP managers will ensure sufficient restrooms support the maximum
       number of personnel required during peak periods (e.g., CAT activation). When
       possible, restrooms should be located within the CP secure area.
       8.4.6.3. Storage. The CP will have sufficient storage space to store housekeeping
       supplies, controller chemical warfare ensembles, emergency rations, and in-place
       equipment spares, as applicable.
   8.4.7. Emergency Exit. All CPs must have an emergency exit that can only be opened from
   inside the CP. Exit doors will not open directly into the EA cell/console area. The doors will
   have an audible alarm for controllers on the console to be alerted when opened.
   8.4.8. (Added-AFSPC) Workout Area. Due to controllers working rotating shifts, when
   space allows, CPs should have a workout area for controllers.
8.5. General CP Requirements. Ensure all CP console positions (e.g., senior, duty, reports
controller) are provided enough “immediate” workspace for computer systems, checklists, and
other material deemed necessary in the performance of the mission.
   8.5.1. Reproduction Equipment. The CP will have a copier authorized to reproduce, as a
   minimum, SECRET material located within the CP, in the immediate vicinity of the console.
   8.5.2. The EA cell/console area will have a minimum of two 24-hour wall clocks; one set to
   local time, the other set to Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) (ZULU time). The clocks
   must have a battery back-up and be hacked, at a minimum, daily with the U.S. Naval
   Observatory Master Clock to within one second.
   8.5.3. Event Timer. The EA cell/console area must have the means to provide an audible
   alarm for required or recurring events.
   8.5.4. Safes. Ensure the EA cell/console area has a General Services Administration (GSA)
   approved security container, equipped with an XO-style digital lock, dedicated to store TS,
   TPC material, COMSEC TPI, and COMSEC material, as applicable. Ensure safes are
 72                                                   AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013


   maintained and combinations are changed IAW AFI 33-201 V2, COMSEC User
   Requirements.
   8.5.5. (Added-AFSPC) Cross-cut shredder. Use for destruction of classified material and
   COMSEC. Purchase the shredder from the National Security Agency (NSA) evaluated
   destruction device approved listing. Device must be certified to destroy material up to the
   highest classification of material maintained within the CP.
   8.5.6. (Added-AFSPC) Location of CP equipment. Equipment normally operated by the
   on-duty controller will be located within the console area for immediate access. Equipment
   positioning must comply with applicable requirements in AFI 33-203 V1, Emission Security.
   8.5.7. (Added-AFSPC) Equipment Manuals/Instructions. Documentation must be
   maintained by the NCOIC, Systems for each piece of equipment (CP and ACP) that provides
   instruction for use and who to contact if the equipment malfunctions. (e.g., Operations
   Manuals)
8.6. ACP. The goal for an ACP is to replicate the capabilities housed in the primary facility.
CP managers must develop procedures to perform CP duties from an alternate site located away
from the primary facility. This facility is not required to be an exact duplicate of the primary CP,
but must provide the ability to provide continued C2 capability and comply with mission/PL
requirements and communication systems, should the primary CP become
unusable/incapacitated. MAJCOMs will supplement this paragraph to establish minimum
specific facility and equipment requirements.
8.6. (AFSPC)ACP. The following are minimum established requirements for AFSPC Alternate
CPs/Alternate Command Center: NIPRNet/SIPRNet terminals with print capability, secure
phone lines STE, Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN), multi-line (conferencing capable)
console phones, Communication Security (COMSEC)-cleared shredder, status display boards
(i.e., readiness conditions, weather, aircraft, key personnel), same Land Mobile Radio
(LMR)/Ultra High Frequency (UHF)/Very High Frequency (VHF)/High Frequency (HF)
capability as primary CP. Furniture will be in good condition and free from safety hazards, and
be positioned in a fashion to allow for an effective flow of communication between controllers.
All phones in the EA Cell must have push-to-talk handsets. All mission-essential C2 systems
will also be available in the alternate. The ACP/Alternate Command Center will be cleared to
process the highest level of classification the mission dictates. Maintain the current Emission
Security (EMSEC) letter on file.
   8.6.1. General Requirements. The general requirements for CPs and EA cells/console areas
   outlined in this instruction also apply to ACPs in the areas of building construction, security,
   power, emergency lighting, ventilation, emissions security (EMSEC) and computer security
   (COMPUSEC), storage, communications, and display space.
   8.6.2. Activation of ACP. CP managers will develop and maintain OIs and/or QRCs to
   ensure timely placement of required CP personnel and material in the ACP in response to
   either an emergency situation requiring evacuation or commander directive. As a minimum,
   the following items should be addressed in the ACP activation OI/QRC:
       8.6.2.1. Required Material. Either pre-position required materials or plan for the
       transportation of the material to the ACP. Classified pre-positioned material must be
       stored IAW applicable security directives.
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                           73


          8.6.2.1.1. Controller Weapons. Provide controller weapons, if applicable, and the
          capability to follow procedures IAW AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling
          Manual.

          markers, blank paper, and forms, as required.
       8.6.2.2. Information Updates. Provide primary and alternate methods for the timely
       transfer of pertinent information between the primary CP and the ACP, if applicable.
       8.6.2.3. Transfer of Control. Provide procedures for transfer control from the primary
       CP to the ACP and back, to include notification of appropriate HHQ agencies.
       8.6.2.4. Systems. ACP systems will be tested quarterly.
       8.6.2.5. Semiannual Activation. CP managers will ensure ACP is activated for a
       minimum of 2 consecutive hours. Activations as a result of real world and or exercise
       events will fulfill the semiannual requirement, as long as all systems were tested and or
       activated. Documentation of ACP activation will be kept with CP evacuation kit for a
       minimum of 2 years. MAJCOMs will prescribe documentation requirements. ACP
       facility/systems discrepancies must be corrected as soon as practical. Additionally, all
       ACP facility/systems discrepancies will be briefed as part of the shift change briefing
       until resolved.
       8.6.2.5. (AFSPC) Semiannual Activation. Documentation of ACP activation will be
       logged in the daily events log. Documentation in events log will include names of
       controller(s) completing activation, status of all systems tested (include work order
       submission information for any deficiencies), and all other ACP actions completed as
       directed by AFI 10-207 and this Supplement.
       8.6.2.6. Evacuation/Relocation Kit.       CP managers will establish a “CP
       Evacuation/Relocation Kit” that includes flashlights, one copy of all checklists, paper
       copies of required forms, computer(s), radios, cellular telephone, and other materials
       deemed necessary for sustained C2 operations.
       8.6.2.7. Secure Transport. CP managers will establish procedures for expedient and
       secure transport for controllers, classified, and COMSEC material to and from the
       alternate facility. If flying operations are ongoing, consideration toward obtaining a
       vehicle with suitable communications will be made.
8.7. CP Facility Remodeling. Prior to construction, CP managers will coordinate design/plans
with the installation SF Information Security and Physical Security section, Civil Engineering,
Communications Squadron EMSEC personnel, and MAJCOM C2 Policy and Procedures, to
ensure compliance with guidelines. This includes initiation of equipment installation/removal
affecting CP layout. CP managers will maintain a copy of the most current configuration
drawing(s). Include the following items:
   8.7.1. Location of each functional area.
   8.7.2. Clearance-level required for personnel working in each area.
   8.7.3. Location of classified processing equipment and level of classification (STE, TBMCS,
   etc.).

                                           Chapter 9

                          SYSTEMS AND STATUS REPORTING

9.1. General      Information. This       chapter      identifies   required    communications
systems/capabilities in the CP.
9.2. C2 Systems and Applications. The following is a list of common C2 systems and
applications CPs need to carry out their C2 functions. The list is not all inclusive. Commander’s
discretion is paramount and a risk assessment should be thoroughly conducted before removing a
system or application from local use.
   9.2.1. Secure/Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Networks (SIPRNET/NIPRNET)
   Computers. Access to SIPRNET/NIPRNET is required at each console position, allowing
   for proper information flow; operating communication database-run applications; mission
   monitoring; transmitting/receiving reports; and performing overall C2. Controllers must
   have active accounts and be able to log into all systems.
   9.2.2. Secure/Non-Secure Facsimile. The capability to receive and transmit critical
   information (e.g., EAM, WARNORD, Plans, etc), through the telephone network via
   secure/unsecured means is required as a back-up for SIPR/NIPR outages or degraded
   communications.
   9.2.3. Land Mobile Radio (LMR). Radio communication service between mobile and land
   stations, or between mobile stations. LMRs are required for commanders’ quick-time recall
   and availability status. Other suitable systems, such as Blackberry® or cellular phone with
   mass notification capability, may be approved in lieu of LMRs.
   9.2.4. Secure Voice Communication.           Secure phones are encrypted            telephone
   communication systems allowing units to discuss classified (e.g., STE, VOSIP)
   9.2.5. Cellular Telephone. At least one cellular telephone must be maintained by the CP, to
   maintain communication with external agencies when landlines are not in service. CP
   managers will ensure cellular phone storage practices do not violate EMSEC requirements.
   Weekly cellular phone checks must be accomplished and results annotated in the CP daily
   events log.
   9.2.6. C2 communications console. Consoles will integrate network and application
   technology to enable calls, recording, UHF, and phone-patch capability. The console must
   meet JCS-directed Joint Interoperability Test Command (JTIC) certification (DODI 8100.3,
   Department of Defense (DoD) Voice Networks) and Multi-Level Precedence and Preemption
   (MLPP) compliance (CJCSI 6215.01B, Policy for Department of Defense Voice Networks)
   for all C2 communication systems.
   9.2.7. High Frequency (HF)/Ultra High Frequency (UHF)/Very High Frequency (VHF)
   Radio. HF/UHF/VHF radios are required to communicate directly with aircraft and mission
   essential personnel and are mission dependent. As a minimum, all CPs, regardless of
   installation mission/configuration (i.e., lack of an operational mission/active runway) will
   have a UHF radio, to facilitate C2 with aircraft transiting their area.

  collocated agencies (e.g., ATOC, MOC, EOC) will have a push-to-talk feature installed.
  9.4.5. (Added-AFSPC) Land Mobile Radio (LMR). Prior to entering the CP, LMRs will be
  turned off and the battery disconnected. Emergency response personnel (fire department,
  security forces, etc.) may take radios into the CP when responding to a situation if
  Commander approved and is stated in governing Wing/Base directives. Commanders may
  authorize the use of LMRs by specific CAT positions while they are performing CAT duties.
  Personnel transiting the facility are not authorized to bring LMRs into the CP. Commanders
  will take the following into consideration when making the decision:
     9.4.5.1. (Added-AFSPC) The CP is not a designated Sensitive Compartmented
     Information Facility (SCIF), a Top Secret Working Area (TSWA), or a secure
     telecommunications facility (TCF).
     9.4.5.2. (Added-AFSPC) LMRs are not permitted in the EA cell and Global Command
     and Control System (GCCS) terminal areas.
     9.4.5.3. (Added-AFSPC) The Commander conducts a thorough risk analysis
     considering, as a minimum, COMSEC, EMSEC, and Operational Security (OPSEC)
     factors.
     9.4.5.4. (Added-AFSPC) Each CP will establish formal procedures for taking LMRs
     into the CP. These procedures must be coordinated with applicable communications,
 78                                                   AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013


       COMSEC, EMSEC, OPSEC, security forces and intelligence agencies. Precautions must
       be taken to prevent compromises of classified information and OPSEC violations.
       9.4.5.5. (Added-AFSPC) LMRs will be stored in a storage area at the CP (either outside
       or inside the entrapment area). If the Commander chooses, LMRs may be stored in a
       lead-lined container inside the CP to facilitate an orderly relocation process.
       9.4.5.6. (Added-AFSPC) LMRs are authorized for use during communications outages
       or when relocated to an alternate facility with limited communications capabilities.
       9.4.5.7. (Added-AFSPC) Cellular phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) will be
       turned off and left at the CP entrance or an alternate location (i.e., vehicle or office). CP’s
       are not responsible for any electronic devices stored while visitor’s or CAT members are
       operating in the CP. Cellular phones are authorized for use during communications
       outages or when relocated to an alternate facility with limited communications
       capabilities.
9.5. Cryptographic and Communications Security (COMSEC). The AKAC-1553, Triad
Numerical Cipher/Authentication System, is the primary 1C3 authentication document and will
be maintained in all CPs. The AKAC-1553 may be used by any AF C2 node to authenticate with
other AF C2 nodes in time of suspected duress, validate direction/orders received, and/or to
authenticate with transiting aircraft, etc. Maintain additional cryptographic and COMSEC
material applicable to mission requirements.

                                          Chapter 10

    COMMAND POST/COMMAND CENTER SECURITY AND ENTRY CONTROL
                       REQUIREMENTS

10.1. Physical Security Considerations. It is the responsibility of CP managers, in conjunction
with the unit Resource Protection Program Manager, to ensure appropriate security measures are
in-place and maintained. The CP facility must be designated and controlled as a USAF
Controlled Area (PL-4) or Restricted Area (PL- 1–3) at the PL equal to the highest PL
resource(s) owned/supported/executed by the CP, IAW AFI 31-101, and applicable MAJCOM
supplements. If the CP is physically collocated with the CAT/EOC, a separate restricted area
must be established for the CP EA cell.
   10.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) Additional Physical Security Considerations. The PL of the CP
   facility will also be recorded in the Integrated Defense Plan (IDP). If the CP PL is
   determined to be 1, 2 or 3, include rationale in the IDP to explain the designation (with
   specific detail on operational support of assets assigned).
10.2. Entry and Circulation Control. Entry and circulation control procedures are based on
the PL assigned to the facility and contained in each Installation Security Instruction or
Installation Defense Plan, in addition to AFI 31-101 and applicable MAJCOM supplements. The
CP must have an OI and/or QRC for CP entry and circulation control. As a minimum, the
following areas will be addressed:
   10.2.1. Entry and Exit Procedures. Strict entry procedures are required to provide adequate
   protection for personnel working inside the restricted area and to eliminate unnecessary
   traffic. CP entry is controlled by the on-duty controllers during normal day-to-day
   operations. Armed SF or SF augmentees may control entry during CAT activation,
   contingencies, increased FPCONs, or as determined by the commander. No other individuals
   will admit or allow entry of any persons desiring access without the specific approval of an
   on-duty controller. Unit procedures must comply with the following, if applicable:
       10.2.1.1. During routine operations, only one door of an entrapment/standoff area may
       be open at a time.
       10.2.1.2. During routine operations, personnel exiting the CP must ensure the
       entrapment/standoff area is clear (i.e., no one in entrapment/standoff area) before opening
       the inside door. When an armed entry controller is present, he or she will control access
       into the entrapment/standoff area and CP.
   10.2.2. Unescorted Entry. Visitors authorized unescorted access to the CP may be permitted
   entry upon examination of their RAB and supporting security techniques IAW AFI 31-101.
       10.2.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) CP Chief and/or Superintendent will ensure personnel
       granted unescorted access to the CP possess the appropriate security clearance, need-to-
       know, and require frequent access to perform their official duties.
       10.2.2.2. (Added-AFSPC) CP Chief and/or Superintendent are the only command post
       personnel authorized to recommend issuance of a line badge or entry control badge for
       the CP restricted/controlled area.
80                                                   AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013


     10.2.2.3. (Added-AFSPC) The entry control badge will be used by all personnel
     granted unescorted access and must be displayed above the waist and in plain sight at all
     times while in the CP.
  10.2.3. IG team members and SAV/FAV team members are not required to have the locally
  designated CP area numbers open on their RAB; inspectors and evaluators will use their own
  military ID (CAC), RAB, and/or advanced entry control card from their home station for
  entry, if a Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) visit request or valid EAL is in place.
  10.2.4. Personal recognition is a valid technique and can be used after initial verification of
  the individual’s authorization to enter, i.e., all visitors to the CP must be initially identified
  and processed.
  10.2.5. Escorted Entry. Anyone not possessing unescorted entry authority for a specific
  restricted area must be escorted into and while within the area. CP Managers will ensure
  there are procedures to preannounce the presence of escorted personnel requiring authorized
  entry to a restricted area.
     10.2.5.1. When personal recognition cannot be made, escort officials will direct
     personnel requesting entry to pass their restricted area badges and other identification
     credentials through the entrapment/standoff area credentials slot for verification. The
     inner door shall remain secured until the process is complete.
     10.2.5.2. Escort officials will visually confirm personnel inside the entrapment/standoff
     area prior to opening the inner door, to verify only the expected personnel are present, no
     apparent duress exists, and the individual(s) is/are in possession of a RAB or other
     authorized identification. Escort officials will check the contents of bags or packages
     before allowing access to visitors.
     10.2.5.3. Only personnel designated as escort officials by CP managers are authorized to
     sign personnel into the CP, using the AF Form 1109. Escort officials for the CP
     controlled/restricted area will be limited to CP personnel, wing commander, and vice
     wing commander, as applicable. Escort officials must be trained IAW AFI 31-101.
  10.2.6. Circulation Control.
     10.2.6.1. Direct access to the EA cell/console area will be restricted to essential CP
     personnel and key personnel designated by CP managers. Only duty controllers will
     control access to the EA cell/console area.
         10.2.6.1.1. Routine operations. During routine operations, only those CP personnel
         authorized direct access (e.g., the commander, EA controllers, and CP managers) into
         the CP will be given the cipher lock combinations to the external doors. Only
         certified controllers will have the cipher lock combination to EA cell door, if the CP
         is so equipped.
         10.2.6.1.2. CAT Operations. During CAT or high-density operations, when an
         armed SF or SF augmentee has been posted, the SF/augmentee may be given the
         cipher lock combinations to CP inner and outer doors to control entry (not the EA cell
         door). The cipher lock combinations will be changed immediately upon completion
         of the exercise/operation or resolution of the crisis situation.
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                            81


           10.2.6.1.2. (AFSPC) CAT Operations. When the CP entry control is manned by SF
           personnel or trained augmentees, the CP will provide the entry controllers an Entry
           Authority List (EAL), special written security instructions, and positional duty
           briefings before they assume entry control duties.
           10.2.6.1.3. Once visitors requiring escort have been processed into the CP by an
           escort official, the escort official may designate another individual authorized
           unescorted entry to control visitors. The escort official must ensure the escort is
           aware of the safety and security requirements pertinent to the visit. Procedures must
           be in-place to ensure personnel without both a need to know and the proper security
           clearance are cleared from the EA area and restricted from hearing conversations
           when the unit missions dictate classified discussion between controllers.
10.3. RABs. Security directives require the base or unit to have an instruction covering the
administrative procedures for granting restricted area entry. Although the base regulation is not
the functional responsibility of the CP, CP managers must ensure the base regulation does the
following:
   10.3.1. Designates enough CP personnel, by position, authorized to sign the AF Form 2586,
   Unescorted Entry Authorization Certificate, and to ensure timely coordination of the form,
   but not so many that close control is lost.
   10.3.2. Has a restricted area number designated for the CP. When coordinating an AF Form
   2586, authorize this area for all personnel who are authorized unescorted access to the CP
   restricted/controlled area.
   10.3.3. Has a separate restricted area number specifically designated for EA cell. When
   coordinating on an AF Form 2586, authorize this area only for those personnel who work in
   the EA cell, e.g., the commander, EA controllers, and CP managers.
10.4. EALs. The CP will prepare and maintain records that contain all permanent EALs, active
one-time EALs, and EALs applicable for duration of evaluations/inspections/exercises. All
EALs must be validated and authenticated according to AFI 31-101, applicable MAJCOM
supplements, and local procedures.
   10.4.1. Unit EALs. The CP will request validated and signed copies of EALs from the SF
   function to support unescorted entry procedures.
   10.4.2. Emergency Power Generator Access List. For CP that control access to the
   emergency power generator, an access list will be maintained. This access list will include
   maintenance personnel and all personnel trained to start emergency generators.
   10.4.3. Frame Room Access List. This list is required when the frame room is located
   outside the CP and will contain the names of essential maintenance personnel.

                                        Chapter 11

                 COMMAND POST CONTINGENCY DEPLOYMENTS

11.1. Contingency Deployments.
   11.1.1. In support of crises and contingencies, the USAF and CP career field are committed
   to provide forces where and when needed throughout the world. Preparing CP personnel for
   deployment is necessary and entails requirements and actions to be completed; also known as
   personnel readiness responsibilities.
   11.1.2. To achieve maximum personnel readiness, IAW AFPAM 10-100, Airman’s Manual,
   Section 2, ensure the following requirements and actions are completed: Readiness
   (ancillary) training, information assurance awareness training, contingency out-processing,
   medical out-processing, current and available documentation that must be hand-carried for
   in-processing at Forward Operating Location (FOL), and possession of all required
   equipment/uniforms/personal baggage.          Supervisors will ensure scheduling of
   training/appointments and requirements/actions are completed in a timely manner.
11.2. Contingency Training.
   11.2.1. MAJCOM and CP managers need to look beyond the normal training scope of
   satisfying home unit mission requirements because of our increased involvement in
   contingency deployments. MAJCOMs, working in conjunction with the AFCFM and CP
   managers, will identify contingency training to support mission requirements at FOLs in the
   ATP/MTL.
      11.2.1.1. MAJCOMs will cross-tell information on tasks being performed at the FOLs.
      This information will be used to identify contingency training requirements in their
      ATP/MTL.
      11.2.1.2. MAJCOMs/Units will take the tasks identified in the ATP/MTL and build
      contingency training into their Master Lessons Plans.
   11.2.2. The AFCFM and MFMs are encouraged to attend the Contingency Wartime
   Planning Course (CWPC), at Maxwell AFB, AL. This course provides senior leaders and
   managers with a foundation of knowledge in Joint and AF contingency and deliberate
   planning processes and systems.
11.3. Contingency Management. Contingency management ensures personnel and equipment
are properly sourced to meet the demands of wartime/contingency operations. Based upon
inputs provided by individual CP managers, MFMs will posture all MAJCOM 1C3X1 resources
in UTC Availability. AFPC/DPW will recommend sourcing of resources to meet worldwide
contingency requirements based upon what is postured within the AEF Time Phased Force
Deployment Data (TPFDD) Library. MFMs will validate AFPC/DPW recommendations, and
then the tasking will flow to the unit via a Joint Operations Planning and Execution System
(JOPES) Levy.
   11.3.1. AEF Assignment.
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                            83


       11.3.1.1. The assigning of controllers to an AEF tempo band is mandated by CSAF, to
       ensure each Airman knows the specific AEF band and block they are assigned. This
       provides each Airman with stability and predictability of their AEF deployment window.
       11.3.1.2. CP managers are responsible for assigning controllers, by name, to a specific
       UTC and ensuring controllers know which tempo band they are assigned to within 15
       days of arrival on station. Document the UTC and controller understanding on the
       individual’s AF Form 623A.
          11.3.1.2.1. CP managers should ensure their resources (controllers) are evenly
          distributed across all bands, to prevent being over-tasked in a single band, as well as
          providing AFPC/DPW personnel in every band.
          11.3.1.2.2. Before placing a controller in a tempo band, CP managers should
          consider factors such as the member’s date arrived station, previous deployments, and
          any other factors which may impact their ability to deploy in an assigned band. Once
          assigned to a tempo band, the member will remain in that tempo band for the duration
          of their assignment unless a HAF directed realignment is directed according to AFI
          10-401.
       11.3.1.3. Priority for placement of controllers against a UTC is based on deployment
       coding. DWS is first, DXS is second, and DXX is last. Additional personnel assigned
       over authorizations are spread across the AEF blocks to provide reserve assets. Refer to
       AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution for further guidance
       concerning planning, deployment, employment, sustainment, posture coding,
       redeployment, and reconstitution of forces.
   11.3.2. Commanders Remarks. It is required that CP managers enter specific remarks in the
   “Commanders Remarks” section of the AEF Reporting Tool (ART) assessment report when
   a UTC is marked “Yellow” or “Red”. Remarks need to be specific enough that the MFM and
   AFPC/DPW know exactly if a UTC is available to deploy and if it is not.
11.4. CP Post Deployment Critique. MFMs and CP managers are responsible for ensuring CP
personnel returning from a deployment complete a CP Post Deployment Critique Form
(Attachment 6) within 30 calendar days of returning to duty. Critiques will be reviewed by the
individual’s CP managers and sent to the MFM. MFMs will forward all critiques to the AFCFM
for review and action.
11.4. (AFSPC)CP Post Deployment Critique. Submit the completed CP Post Deployment
Critique Form to HQ AFSPC/MFM and HQ AFSPC/A3OP-P, Command Post Policy and
Procedures, via e-mail.

                COMMAND POST INSPECTIONS/ASSISTANCE VISITS

12.1. Overview. The SAV/FAV, Self-Inspection (SI), and Compliance Inspection (CI)
programs are designed to review unit CP programs for compliance with published guidance.
Additionally, the SAV and FAV programs provide command advice, clarification, and assistance
to facilitate unit compliance with existing policies, and identify potential deficiencies and
corrective actions.
12.2. SAV/FAV. SAVs/FAVs are not IG-related inspections.                     SAVs/FAVs are
periodic/recurring visits from MAJCOM headquarters functional experts to headquarters and
subordinate CPs. The purpose of the program is to enhance standardization; ensure the
effectiveness of training, procedures, equipment, and facilities; improve resource management
and mission effectiveness, and assist CP managers in identifying and correcting deficiencies.
Teams will not give IG-type ratings related to programs or personnel performance.
12.2. (AFSPC)SAVs/FAV. CP Managers will notify HQ AFSPC/A3OP, CP Policy and
Procedures, via e-mail if AFRC is planning to conduct a SAV on the CP. Email will include

   SAV/FAV Team is made up of functional experts. The purpose of a SAV/FAV is to provide
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                        87


  guidance and assistance, and ensure compliance with baseline standards IAW HQ USAF and
  AFSPC C2 policy and procedures. SAV/FAVs will be conducted utilizing current AF and
  AFSPC Self-Assessment Checklists (SAC), in addition to any other areas deemed necessary
  during the course of the visit or as identified on the SAV/FAV request.
     12.2.4.1. (Added-AFSPC) SAV Testing. The AFSPC SAV team will administer a
     closed book EA exam to all certified controllers. Controllers who are between 12 hour
     night shifts may be scheduled to test at the discretion of the CP leadership or SAV Team
     Chief. Controllers in training will take the examination on a “no fault” basis.

       12.3.1.1. Be locally tailored to the organization's structure and mission.
       12.3.1.2. Contain oversight mechanisms to provide adequate coverage of the
       organization's mission, resources, training, and people programs. These mechanisms
       may consist of periodically administered checklists, quality control or assurance reviews,
       internal audits, functional inspections, management information systems, numerical
       summaries, management objective reviews, analysis programs (trend, management, or
       comparative), etc.
       12.3.1.3. Identify problems without regard to the difficulty of resolution.
       12.3.1.4. Contain a feedback mechanism, so identified problems can be tracked until
       resolved, waivers or outside assistance obtained, or limiting factors reported formally.
       12.3.1.5. Contain a mechanism that will, according to importance or severity, direct
       problems to the proper level for action or attention.

performance, or capabilities in these areas could result in legal liabilities, penalties, severe injury,
or negative mission impact.
   12.4.1. Locations where one CP supports multiple MAJCOMS, the MAJCOM that owns the
   installation will be responsible for conducting the CI. The report will be shared with the
   supporting MAJCOMs, and will suffice for the supporting MAJCOM CI requirements.
   12.4.2. The CP is responsible to meet all supported MAJCOM mission/inspection
   requirements.
   12.4.3. CIs/ORIs/NSIs are conducted IAW AFI 90-201 and MAJCOM supplements.

Terms
Advanced Computer Flight Plan (ACFP)—An AMC document that provides flight crews with
winded, optimized flight plans for improved fuel economy and increased payloads. The flight
planner uses a Microsoft Windows based interface and communicates with the mainframe
located at Scott AFB, IL. Once the optimized flight plans are calculated, they are returned to the
user. Flight plans can be received in a format which will allow the user to open that flight plan
in PFPS (Portable Flight Planning Software), ultimately allowing the user to manipulate the data
and/or load the flight plan electronically into the aircraft mission computer. Creates electronic
flight plan Forms 175 and 1801 for filing with FAA. Database derived from Digital
Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) provided by NIMA. Future developments include
a web-based interface and improved interoperability with AFMSS and AMC C2 systems.

Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)—Airlift service provided for the movement of patients by AMC
aircraft assigned for aeromedical evacuation purposes.
Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF)—An organization comprised of air and space
capabilities that provides tailored force packages to meet combatant commander needs across the
full spectrum of military operations. AEFs are inherently capable of performing one or more of
the AF’s basic functions: Counterair, counterspace, counterland, countersea, strategic attack,
counterinformation, C2, airlift, air refueling, spacelift, space support, special operations
employment, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and combat search and rescue. The
fundamental underpinning to the sustained execution of these functions is the AF’s ability to
provide the full complement of Expeditionary Combat Support forces.
Air Mobility Control Center (AMCC)—AMCC is the functional name for the C2 flight that is
a part of each AMS. AMCCs provide C2 support at key en route locations. Normally OCONUS
AMCCs manage all aircraft and aircrews operating AMC and AMC-gained missions through
their location. Assigned personnel monitor strategic mobility missions, report mission
movement, and coordinate ground support activities to include maintenance, aerial port services,
and aircrew support for all AMC and AMC-gained missions transiting their station.
Air Mobility Division (AMD)—The air mobility division of an AOC plans, coordinates, tasks,
and executes air mobility operations for the COMAFFOR/JFACC. As one of the five divisions
of the AOC under the AOC Director, the AMD provides integration and support of all JOA air
mobility missions. The AMD Chief ensures the division effectively participates in the AOC
planning and execution process. The AOC director provides policy and guidance to the AMD
regarding the air and space planning and execution process. The AMD tasks intratheater air
mobility forces through wing and unit command posts when those forces operate from home
bases, and through applicable forward C2 nodes. The AMD usually consists of the following
four teams: the air mobility control team (AMCT), the airlift control team (ALCT), the air
refueling control team (ARCT), and the aero medical evacuation control team (AECT). The
DIRMOBFOR should be collocated in the AOC to facilitate their close working relationship
with the AMD.
Air Operations Center (AOC)—The senior agency of the AF component commander that
provides C2 of AF air and space operations and coordinates with other components and services.
Augmented Aircrew—A basic aircrew supplemented by additional aircrew members to permit
in-flight rest periods. As a minimum, an augmented crew provides for in-flight rest for
crewmembers, if they are authorized and required for aircraft being flown or missions being
performed.
Authentication—A security measure designed to protect a communication system against the
acceptance of fraudulent transmission or simulation by establishing the validity of a message,
transmission, or originator.
Border Clearance—Those clearances and inspections required to comply with Federal, state,
and local Agricultural, Customs, Immigration, and immunization requirements.
Change Of Operational Control (CHOP)—The date and time (Greenwich Mean Time-GMT)
at which the responsibility for operational control of a force or unit passes from one operational
control authority to another. The CHOP point is the geographical position where responsibility
for operational control of a mission is transferred.
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                            103


Closed Circuit Flightline Video (CCFV)—Provides closed circuit television system with
taping capability. Monitors and camera controls are located in AMC CPs, AMCCs, and SFCCs.
Cameras are strategically placed and monitor aircraft parking, maintenance, and loading areas.
CLOSE HOLD Missions—Certain highly sensitive missions that require special handling,
limited access, and modification to normal C2 procedures.
CLOSE WATCH Missions—Term used to ensure designated missions receive special
attention, all possible actions are taken to ensure on-time accomplishment, and users are notified
when delays occur or can be anticipated.
Command and Control (C2)—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. C2
functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications,
facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and
controlling forces/operations in the accomplishment of the mission.
Command and Control System—The facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, and
personnel essential to a commander for planning, directing, and controlling operations of
assigned forces pursuant to the mission.
Command Center—The Command Center serves as the Higher Headquarters (HHQs) full-time
24/7 C2 node. The Command Center is a direct representative of the HHQs commander and
serves as the focal point of the HHQs operation, and as such receives and disseminates laterally,
up and down the chain-of-command) orders, information, and requests necessary for the C2 of
assigned forces and operations.
Command Post (CP)—The CP serves as one of the Installation’s Command and Control (IC2)
full-time 24/7 C2 nodes, directly responsible to the installation commander for IC2. The CP is a
direct representative of the (installation) commander and serves as the focal point of the unit
operation, and as such receives and disseminates orders, information, and requests necessary for
the C2 of assigned forces and operations.
Command Post Managers—The CP Chief and Superintendent directly in charge of the CP.
NOTE: Unless specifically addressed, the use of the term “CP managers” in this AFI implies
actions may be completed by either the Chief or Superintendent.
Contingency Response Group (CRG)—CRGs are designed to be first responders for opening
airbases. These units will bridge the gap between the seizure forces and the follow-on
combat/expeditionary combat support forces. CRGs are critical to the AF’s ability to rapidly
deploy U.S. military forces and initiate air operations of any type in minimal time at any base or
location around the globe. CRGs may also provide C2, aerial port services, quick turn
maintenance, force protection and various airbase support capabilities for AMC’s Global
Mobility mission. The CRG CONOPs and AFI 10-202, Contingency Response Groups,
describes CRG operations.
Crisis Action Team (CAT)—A staff formed by the commander to plan, direct, and coordinate
forces in response to contingencies, crises, natural/manmade disasters, or wartime situations.
The CAT develops courses of action and executes the commander's and HHQ’s directives. The
composition and function of the CAT is largely mission driven and therefore a MAJCOM or unit
commander prerogative. However, membership for the CAT is most frequently a combination

of the commander’s senior staff and special staff which includes a CP representative. The
composition of a CAT varies according to the situation.
Defense Switching Network (DSN)—The basic general-purpose switched voice network of the
Defense Communications System (DCS).
Diversion—Operational term for the in-flight change of an aircraft's intended destination to any
other airfield. Diversion is differentiated from a reroute in that a diversion occurs during flight.
DV/VIP—Distinguished visitor/very important person. Military passengers, including those of
friendly nations, of star, flag rank, or equivalent status to include diplomats, cabinet members,
and members of Congress. Others may be designated as VIPs due to their mission or position by
the agency of the Department of Defense authorizing the individual's travel. BLUE BARK
passengers are handled by AMC as VIPs. DV/VIP Codes are listed in the DoD Flight

Emergency Action Messages (EAM)—Messages through which JCS and subordinate
commanders pass significant directives to their forces.
Emergency Operations Center (EOC)—The central emergency management C2 element for
expanded emergency or contingency response operations that require additional support beyond
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                            105


the Incident Command Staff capabilities; including major accidents, natural disasters, enemy
attack, and terrorist use of CBRNE materials. The EOC is organized into 15 Emergency Support
Functions (ESF), as mandated by the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) and
identified in AFI 10-2501.
En Route Station—Station between points of origin and destination at which missions will stop.
Flight Manager—Flight Managers are trained in accordance with (IAW) AFI 11-255, Volume
1, Integrated Flight Management Training, and evaluated and certified IAW FAA, AF, and
MAJCOM standards. Flight Managers confirm information (weather, NOTAM, intelligence)
needed to plan assigned sorties is accurate, complete, and deconflicted; create risk-mitigated
flight plans; file flight plans with ATS, prepare, publish, and transmit accurate and complete
ADP’s, provide verbal departure briefings to aircrews when contacted by the aircrew, flight
watch the sortie from takeoff to landing assisting aircrews in execution as required, and
coordinate sortie mission issues with appropriate authorities. They serve as the focal point of a
centralized support network which proactively monitors the sortie’s operational environment,
predicatively analyzes changes in key information elements that could pose hazards/risks to
sortie success, derives alternatives and pushes actionable plans (dynamic retasking) to the
aircrew and ATS.
Force Protection Condition (FPCON)—The FPCON system is a program standardizing the
military services identification of, and recommended responses to terrorist threats against U.S.
personnel and facilities. FPCONs are declared IAW AFI 31-101. Complete descriptions and
measures are detailed in AFI 31—245, Antiterrorism(AT).
Global Command and Control System (GCCS)—GCCS is a single, global C4I architecture to
support the war fighter, whether from a foxhole or from a Combatant Commander’s CP. A
major part of the initial GCCS application environment is JOPES, which was migrated,
translated, and developed from legacy and prototype subsystems, to run within the GCCS
infrastructure.
Global Decision Support System (GDSS)— GDSS is used for MAF and SOF aircraft
worldwide. It is also used by CAF for selected missions. It is capable of unclassified/classified
operations and interfaces with over 40 systems, to include GCCS and TBMCS accessed via
GDSS client, remotely from the WWW, with a deployable remote (disconnect) capability. AMC
is the lead command, responsible for GDSS development, testing, fielding, requirements, and
application training.
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)—Also called Zulu time. Used as the standard time throughout
the world.
Hazardous Cargo/Materials— Explosive, toxic, caustic, nuclear, combustible, flammable,
biologically infectious, or poisonous materials that may directly endanger human life or property,
particularly if misused, mishandled, or involved in accidents.
Information Operations Condition (INFOCON)—Identifies the criteria for posturing forces to
combat attacks against our information infrastructure. INFOCONs will be established to defend
against a different type of warfare that’s not limited to physical boundaries. INFOCONs address
protection of AF assets against electronic offensive actions and defensive countermeasures,
jamming, and denial of service. They will also prompt the response to generate offensive forces
 106                                                AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013


and detail defensive countermeasures. An INFOCON establishes specific alert levels and
defines graduated response AF commanders must take at all organizational levels.
Installation Commander—The individual typically responsible for all operations performed by
an installation, normally the host unit commander.
Installation Command and Control (IC2)—The IC2 construct provides the commander of a
USAF home station or a deployed AEW/AEG to an expeditionary base with a single,
consolidated C2 center from which to monitor, assess, plan, and execute the full range of
installation activities. A key function of IC2 is the CP, other key IC2 functions may include the
CAT, MOC, EOC, SFD, Fire (911), and a basic intelligence function. Regardless of physical
location, all IC2 nodes should be linked virtually (virtual IC2) to expedite information flow
during disasters/contingencies.
Installation Notification Warning Systems (INWS)—The INWS is a combination of methods
using audible and visual signals, verbal messages, and electronic communication.
Communication modes include sirens, horns, radio tone alerting, MNS, unaided voice
systems, public and broadcast address systems, local area network messaging, telephone
alert conferencing, pagers, television, radio, flags, signs, and other electronic or mechanical
methods. See UFC 4—021-01 for details about warning standards.
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Codes—Four letter codes that identify
specific locations. The first letter indicates the ICAO region and the nation/location by the last
three letters. All Continental US codes begin with "K." (For example: "KCHS" designates
Charleston AFB and "KDOV" stands for Dover AFB.) This listing also includes Encode and
Decode listings, e.g., 4-letter code to airport and airport to 4-letter code.
Jabber—Common instant messaging platform that works in a fashion similar to chat rooms,
using a distributed architecture. CPs utilize SIPRNet Jabber to transmit time sensitive
operational information (AF OPREP-3s).
Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT)—A JCS-directed, AMC-managed
program which provides basic airborne and combat airlift proficiency/continuation training for
airdrop, assault landing, and aircraft static loading conducted in a joint DoD environment. It
ensures continued combat readiness of forces assigned and/or programmed for assignment to
unified commands.
Mission Management—The function of organizing, planning, directing, and controlling airlift
and/or tanker mission operating worldwide. Mission management includes mission execution
authority, the authority to direct where and when a mission goes and what it does once it arrives
there.
Mission Monitoring—The function of organizing, planning, directing (limited), and controlling
aircraft operations. Mission monitoring does not include mission execution authority.
Operations Center—The facility or location on an installation/base used by the commander to
command, control, and coordinate all crisis activities.
Operational Readiness—JCS defines Operational Readiness as the capability of a unit, weapon
system, or equipment to perform the mission or function it is organized or designed to undertake.
It may also be used in general sense to express a level or degree of readiness posture. When used
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                              107


in this latter context, JCS has directed all references to readiness posture be classified a minimum
of SECRET.
Operational Unit—A numbered AF organization, which employs assigned combat air, space
and cyber forces, and is listed in USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP), Volume 3, Part 1,
Combat Forces (WMP-3).
Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF)—Designated AMC airlift squadrons and aircrews trained
and certified for peacetime movement of nuclear cargo.
Rescue Coordination Center (RCC)—A primary search and rescue facility suitably staffed by
supervisory personnel and equipped for coordinating and controlling search and rescue and/or
combat search and rescue operations. Personnel of a single service or component operate the
facility unilaterally.
Strategic Knowledge Integration Web (SKIWeb)—provides net-centric, asynchronous,
collaborative event management capability in order to improve situational awareness for all
SIPRNET and Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) authorized users.
Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM)—Those airlift requirements that require special
consideration due to the number of passengers involved, weight or size of cargo, urgency of
movement, sensitivity, or other valid factors that preclude the use of channel airlift.
Special Air Mission (SAM)—Those missions operated by the 89 AW in support of the special
airlift requirements of the Department of Defense.
Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS)—The Joint Staff controlled system that
provides authoritative identification, location, and resource information to the President,
Secretary of Defense, and the JCS.
United States Message Text Format (USMTF) Program—The Secretary of Defense
mandated message format standard. The objective of the program is to produce messages that
are both human readable and machine processable; reduce the time and effort required to draft,
transmit, analyze, interpret, and process messages; improve information exchange through
vocabulary control; provide uniform reporting procedures to be used in all defense conditions
from peacetime through crises, war, and post-attack; and facilitate exchange information
between the United States and allied commands; and reduce or eliminate dual reporting by U.S.
units when they operate with allied commands or units or after their change of operational
control to allied nations or organizations.

Figure A7.1. AFSPC MANNING REPORT




A7.1. (AFSPC) Monthly Manning Report Updates. Ensure when completing the report you
modify the header to reflect your unit designator, base name, and current month/year. Change
the file name to your base (i.e., “Peterson Manning Report.XLS”). The same file will be used for
the entire calendar year. Each month’s manning report will be created on a separate worksheet
tab named for the month it covers. When emailing the report, send the entire file (with all
previous months’ tabs for the current year).
A7.2. (AFSPC) Instructions: Follow manning report instructions from Chapter 3 of this
instruction and all additions amplifying instructions below.
   A7.2.1. (AFSPC) Assigned #s: All personnel are considered assigned as soon as they
   arrive on station and sign-in to the unit and will continue to be counted as assigned until their
   final out-processing for a PCS or until their actual date of separation/retirement. When any
   of the conditions described in this paragraph occur and have not been previously identified
   on your manning report, the unit will update and re-submit their manning report.

  A7.2.2. (AFSPC) Available #s: All personnel are to be considered available as soon as they
  are certified and will continuously be counted as available unless they are deployed or de-
  certified. Personnel who are on leave or TDY will continue to be counted as available as
  long as they are certified.
  A7.2.3. (AFSPC) Certification Type: Use “MULTI” in the cert type column to identify
  personnel as certified in all mission areas performed by your unit (EA – Emergency Actions
  and C2OP – C2 Operations). For all personnel currently entered into initial/refresher
  certification training (to include personnel who have been de-certified), use “TRNG”. If
  individual is decertified due to deployment, use “DPLY”. If individual has been de-certified
  and removed from the CP, leave cell blank. If de-certified for any reason other than
  deployment, provide a complete explanation in the remarks (Note: If reason is medical, do
  not state specific reason, annotate “MEDICAL” and end date).
  A7.2.4. (AFSPC) AEF Pair & TDY Status: Enter the AEF band & block the member is
  assigned to.        If the member is non-deployable, (i.e., medical, established
  retirement/separation date, etc.) provide unclassified reason and end date in remarks column.
  (Note: If reason is medical, do not state specific reason, annotate “MEDICAL” and end
  date.) For civilian converted billets, if non-deployable, use “N/A” in AEF cell and leave
  status blank, otherwise follow above guidance. If TDY state “Y” or “N” in TDY block and
  annotate location in the Remarks section.
  A7.2.5. (AFSPC) Last DEP/STRD: Enter date (MMM YY) for either return from last
  deployment supporting a contingency tasking or the unaccompanied Short Tour Return Date
  (STRD). Do not enter dates for both, only enter the most current return date. If individual
  has never been deployed or completed an unaccompanied short tour, use “NONE”. For
  civilian converted billets, if non-deployable, use “ND”, otherwise follow above guidance.
  A7.2.6. (AFSPC) Remarks: The following are mandatory comments – UGT status (if
  applicable); Deployed /TDY location with return date (MMM YY); terminal leave start date
  and actual approved retirement or separation date; SR Controller waivers; Security clearance
  status if not a final TS; DAV codes/reasons and end date for non-deployable status (Note: If
  reason is medical, do not state specific reason, annotate “MEDICAL” and end date). Add
  other additional remarks as desired.
  A7.2.7. (AFSPC) Inbound Personnel: All inbound personnel will be annotated and
  highlighted in yellow in this section. When individuals arrive on station, remove from
  Inbound section and update the assigned section.
  A7.2.8. (AFSPC) All positions from your unit’s Regular AF (RegAF) UMD will be listed
  in the upper section of the manning report. All other positions, to include IMAs, over-hires,
  augmentees, Traditional Reservist on man days, and AFR UMD positions will be included in
  the lower section of the manning report. All ART positions will include their GS designation
  under authorized rank. The CP Chief, Superintendent, and SORTS manager positions will be
  listed at the top of the applicable section and all other positions will follow listed in order of
  authorized rank. All 1C3s working in the command post will be identified on the manning
  report.
  A7.2.9. (AFSPC) Manning Percentages: To aid the MFM in projecting assignments and
  deployments, manning numbers for authorized, assigned, available and assigned/available
AFI 10-207_AFSPCSUP_I 26 JUNE 2013                                                          119


   percentages will include data for current status as well as a 3, 6, 9, and 12 month forecast.
   While it is understood that manning numbers frequently fluctuate, having this forecasted
   information will allow the MFM to make decisions based on the current data available.
   Authorized/available/assigned numbers will only include 1C3X1 billets. Do not include the
   CP Chief, converted SORTS billets or any over-hires in the current or forecast
   numbers/percentages.
   A7.2.10. (AFSPC) All changes that have occurred from the previous month’s report will be
   highlighted by using red text, all other text will be black.
A7.3. (AFSPC) Submission: AFSPC manning reports will be submitted NLT the fifth
calendar day of each month via e-mail to HQ AFSPC/A3OP, CP Policy and Procedures. The
report “as of date” will be the first day of the month. Format for the subject of e-mail will be
“base name month Manning Report” (i.e. Peterson November Manning Report).
