1. Policy.
     1.1. The Crashed, Damaged or Disabled Aircraft Repair (CDDAR) program is established to
     recover damaged or disabled aircraft in minimum time to return Yokota AB to operational
     status as soon as practical after a mishap. The CDDAR program will be consistent with the
     following considerations:
        1.1.1. The requirement to reopen the runway for operational use.
        1.1.2. Prevention of secondary damage to the aircraft.
        1.1.3. Preservation of evidence for mishap investigation.
        1.1.4. Safety of personnel involved with recovery operations.
        1.1.5. IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, when an aircraft is under
        investigation by the Interim Safety Investigation Board, recovery operations will not
        proceed until the board president releases the aircraft. Personnel who are not engaged in
        the investigation will remain outside of the recovery area. The crash recovery team may
        be called upon to perform tasks as required by the investigation team.
     1.2. The CDDAR program instruction is procedural and will not take precedence over
     aircraft-specific technical data in recovery of crashed, damaged or disabled aircraft.
Warning: Transient aircraft servicing air logistics center (ALC) should be contacted to
determine composite material risks and requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE)
and special handling instructions. Caution: The aircraft and crash site will be disturbed only to
the extent required to eliminate an imminently dangerous situation to the aircraft, support
equipment and personnel, and will remain in an undisturbed state until the aircraft is released to
maintenance by the incident commander.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. 374th Maintenance Squadron (374 MXS) Maintenance Flight will:
        2.1.1. Maintain a crash recovery trailer and equipment for home station and
        funded/provided unique Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft specific CDDAR
        equipment. Maintain inventories of specialized crash recovery tools, aircraft tow vehicle,
        tow bar, slings, belly bands, snatch cables, air bags, CDDAR kits and current TOs to
        meet expected crash recovery operations for home station and AMC supported aircraft.
        (AMC will provide/maintain Technical Data for all AMC peculiar aircraft.)
        2.1.2. Provide personnel required to perform CDDAR operations.
        2.1.3. Provide primary and alternate Crash Recovery Team Chiefs (CRTCs).
     2.2. 374 MXS Repair & Reclamation (R&R)/Transient Alert (TA) Section will:
        2.2.1. Manage the CDDAR program and ensure personnel are trained in recovery
        operations. Crash recovery team (CRT) composition and member duties are defined in
        Attachment 2 of this instruction.
        2.2.2. Conduct CRT member training. Selected personnel will be trained for emergency
        and nonstandard towing procedures, standard and nonstandard aircraft lifting procedures,
