     deployment task.       Reports will consist of: 1.) a commander’s memo summarizing
     previous report results/issues, current training plan summary and significant
     shortfalls/limiting factors (LIMFACS) affecting training. 2.) A completed squadron
     training health slide (revised) summarizing critical training issues. Guidance and
     template           can         be         found         at      A3TO’s           COP,

        will submit an End-of-Cycle Training Report each training cycle (12 months). Report all
        deviations from the training requirements in this volume or the RTM, after proration, to
        ACC/A3T at the end of the training cycle. Include in the report all training requirements
        waived by the OG/CC. Squadrons deployed during the end of the training cycle are still
        required to submit an End-of-Cycle Report by the 15th of October. Squadrons will report
        the number of training months and waived number of deployed months. Guidance and
        template           can         be       found          at         A3TO’s            COP,

        only significant shortfalls or LIMFACS that affect 20% or greater of the crew force and
        all events/sorties waived by the OG. Include possible solutions or specific assistance
        required if able. The MAJCOM will attempt to rectify or minimize noted
        shortfalls/LIMFACS while the training cycle is under way.
            1.2.5.13.1. Shortfalls occur when required mission training tasks are not
            accomplished due to shortages of equipment, munitions, etc. Example: unable to
            accomplish actual weapons release due to a shortage of training weapons.
            1.2.5.13.2. LIMFACS are factors, constraints, restrictions, etc. that degrade training
            effectiveness. Example: squadron's ability to accomplish actual weapons release is
            limited due to the lack of ranges that allow aircraft to drop munitions. This may
            include support hardware and software.
     1.2.6. Individual pilots will:
        1.2.6.1. Hand carry all available training records to assist the gaining unit in assessing
        qualifications and training requirements.
        1.2.6.2. Be responsible for completion of training requirements and currencies within the
        guidelines of this volume.
        1.2.6.3. Ensure they participate only in ground and flying activities for which they are
        qualified, current, and prepared.
1.3. Processing Changes:
     1.3.1. Forward recommendations for change to this volume to MAJCOM A3 on AF Form
     847.
     1.3.2. MAJCOMs will forward approved recommendations to HQ ACC/A3.
     1.3.3. HQ ACC/A3 will:
        1.3.3.1. Coordinate all changes to the basic volume with all MAJCOM/A3s.
        1.3.3.2. Forward recommendations for changes to this volume to HQ USAF/A3O-AT for
        HQ USAF/A3/5 approval.
        1.3.3.3. Address time sensitive changes by immediate action message.
        1.3.3.4. MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G) will determine training requirements for
        subordinate units. AFI changes will be issued via revision, Interim Change (IC), or
        Administrative Change (AC) to this publication. Due to dynamic requirements of
        Combatant Commanders, training requirements and currencies may be altered regularly.
        These training requirement and currency adjustments may be made via RAP Tasking
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                   9


       Memorandum. HQ ACC/A3 will be an info addressee on all changes. HQ ACC/A3 will
       include MAJCOM supplemental guidance in the next publication of the AFI.
1.4. Training. Pilot training is designed to progress a pilot from Initial Qualification Training
(IQT) (B Course or Transition/Re-Qualification Training (TX)), then to Mission Qualification
Training (MQT), and finally to Continuation Training (CT).
   1.4.1. IQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify pilots in a basic position and
   flying duties without regard to a unit's mission. Upon completion of IQT, the pilots attain
   Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. BAQ is a prerequisite for MQT. Except for
   General Officers above the wing level, BAQ is not a long-term qualification status. Waiver
   authority for any pilot, other than general officers above the wing level, to remain BAQ is
   MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G).
   1.4.2. MQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify or re-qualify pilots in a
   specific position and flying duties to perform the missions assigned to a specific unit. Pilots
   maintain BAQ status until they complete MQT. Completion of MQT or formal training unit
   (FTU) instructor course is a pre-requisite for BMC and completion of MQT is a pre-requisite
   for CMR.
   1.4.3. CT. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of pilot training in the basic flying
   skills contained in the BAQ portion of the Training Cycle Event Requirements Table and the
   BAQ portion of the Mission Requirements Table (see the RTM). These skills ensure safe
   operation of the aircraft. The second consists of specific mission-related training required to
   accomplish the unit's assigned missions.
   1.4.4. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) is the CT program designed to focus training on
   capabilities needed to accomplish a unit's core tasked missions. Upon completion of IQT and
   MQT, pilots will have received training in all basic missions of the unit (see Chapter 3 for
   exceptions). Pilots will then be assigned to a Combat Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic
   Mission Capable (BMC) position.
       1.4.4.1. Combat Mission Ready (CMR). The minimum training required for a pilot to
       be qualified and proficient in all of the primary missions tasked to their unit and weapons
       system.
       1.4.4.2. All designated combat aircraft (CC-coded) unit active duty API-1 positions, and
       flying SQ/ CC and SQ/DO positions are designated CMR positions. OG/CCs may
       designate other API-6 positions not assigned to the flying squadron as CMR.
       (EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect to train the front line of
       their Unit Manning Document (UMD) API-1s to CMR and designate the overage BMC.
       In this case, priority should be given to inexperienced pilots and no less than 50% of the
       total CMR positions should be inexperienced pilots (where possible)). [For ANG: Any
       pilot may be designated CMR or BMC at OG/CC discretion.] CMR pilots maintain
       proficiency and qualification in all core missions of the flying unit to which they are
       assigned or attached. CMR pilots maintain currencies which affect CMR status,
       accomplish all core designated flight training (sorties and events), and all mission ground
       training. Failure to complete this training or maintain these currencies results in
       regression to Non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived by appropriate authority. While
 10                                                     AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010


      in N-CMR status, pilots may perform missions (including exercises and contingencies)
      and events in which they are current and qualified at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
      1.4.4.3. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). The minimum training required for pilots to be
      familiar in all of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapons system.
      BMC allows pilots to be qualified and proficient in some of the primary missions.
      1.4.4.4. Active duty pilot positions that are not CMR are BMC. Pilots who have primary
      jobs as wing supervision, staff officers that directly support the flying operation, FTU
      instructors and operational test pilots, will carry BMC designations. These pilots are
      required as to provide additional sortie generation capability (in lieu of or in addition to)
      the personnel assigned to the flying squadrons. BMC pilots will maintain familiarization
      with all unit core missions. They may also maintain proficiency and qualification in some
      of the unit core missions. BMC pilots must be able to transition from familiarization to
      proficiency and qualification in 30 days or less. BMC pilots will accomplish all mission
      related ground training designated by their attached SQ/CC. BMC pilots may deploy and
      may participate in any mission for which they are proficient and qualified, without
      additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC. Failure to complete BMC required
      training results in regression to non-BMC (N-BMC) status. The SQ/CC will determine
      missions pilots in N-BMC status may perform and what level of supervision is required.
      1.4.4.5. N-CMR/N-BMC. Pilots that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status will accomplish
      requirements in accordance with paragraph 4.7.
      1.4.4.6. Specialized Training. Training in any special skills necessary to carry out the
      unit's assigned mission. It is not required by every pilot. Specialized training consists of
      upgrade training such as flight lead upgrade (FLUG), instructor pilot upgrade (IPUG),
      etc., as well as CT to maintain proficiency and qualification in unit tasked special
      capabilities and missions. Specialized training is normally accomplished after a pilot is
      assigned CMR/BMC status and is additive to CMR/BMC requirements. Unless otherwise
      specified, pilots in CMR or BMC positions may hold special capabilities/qualifications as
      long as any additional training requirements are accomplished.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies.
   1.5.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness
   consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for
   realism against the expected threat, pilot capabilities, and safety. This volume provides
   training guidelines and policies for use with operational procedures specified in applicable
   flying/operations publications.
   1.5.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (ACC TRSS) will develop and validate training
   programs when/where tasked by the HQ ACC/A3. Other MAJCOMs may submit requests
   for training program support to the HQ ACC/A3. If validated, these requests will be
   prioritized and tasked to ACC TRSS. Designated test units (CB-coded) may develop syllabi
   to upgrade Operational Test Pilots in support of specific test plans. These syllabi will be
   approved by the OG/CC and submitted to ACC TRSS.
   1.5.3. Design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron tasked roles,
   maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RAP training
   missions should emphasize either basic combat skills, or scenarios that reflect procedures and
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                  11


   operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition
   capabilities. Use of procedures and actions applicable to combat scenarios are desired (e.g.,
   appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery
   procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, Intel briefing/debriefing).
   Tactical training will include use of inert and live ordnance, threat simulators,
   countermeasures, and dissimilar aircraft as much as possible.
   1.5.4. In-flight Supervision.
      1.5.4.1. Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervision
      necessary to accomplish the required training. If the mission objectives include
      introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, then an instructor
      pilot (IP) may be required.
      1.5.4.2. IPs and flight lead (FL)-qualified SQ supervisors may allow any pilot to lead
      limited portions of a mission if they are appropriately briefed. This provision will only be
      used to allow the pilot to practice events in which the pilot is already qualified or to help
      determine if the pilot is ready for FLUG. In either case, the IP or SQ supervisor is
      responsible for the flight.
      1.5.4.3. Flight leads may give their wingman the tactical lead for specific tasks. As the
      tactical lead, the wingman makes tactical decisions for the flight, but the flight lead
      retains overall authority and responsibility.
1.6. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Policy and Management:
   1.6.1. The RAP training cycle is each fiscal year and executed IAW the RAP Tasking
   Memorandum. Each RAP qualification level is defined by a total number of RAP missions,
   broken down into mission types, plus specific weapons qualifications and associated events
   as determined by the MAJCOM and unit commanders.
   1.6.2. The total number of RAP missions for a qualification level is the primary factor for
   maintaining an individual's qualification level. The breakout of mission types is provided as a
   guideline to be followed as closely as possible but minor variances are authorized (excludes
   Red Air allocations). Variations in mission types may be used as a basis for regression by the
   SQ/CC. Qualification in a mission is determined by the SQ/CC considering the MAJCOM
   guidance and the individual's capabilities.
   1.6.3. An effective RAP training mission requires accomplishing a tactical mission profile or
   a building block type mission (BFM, etc). Each mission requires successfully completing a
   significant portion of the events applicable to that sortie type, as determined by the SQ/CC
   and Attachment 2.
   1.6.4. The SQ/CC's first priority should be to train all designated pilots to CMR.
   1.6.5. Progression from BMC to CMR requires:
      1.6.5.1. A 1-month look back at the higher mission rate.
      1.6.5.2. Qualification in all core missions, and weapons events required at CMR.
      1.6.5.3. Confirmation that the progressed pilot can complete the prorated number of
      sortie/event requirements remaining at CMR by the end of the training cycle.
 12                                                     AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010


      1.6.5.4. Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification
      or certification.
      1.6.5.5. Squadron CC certification.
   1.6.6. SQ/CCs will determine and assign pilots that will train for and maintain special
   capabilities or qualifications. Specialized training is normally accomplished in addition to
   baseline CMR/BMC sortie/event requirements; except for mission commander and flight
   lead training.
   1.6.7. Wing CMR and BMC pilots will fly the required monthly mission rate. If unable, refer
   to Regression, paragraph 4.7
   1.6.8. End of Cycle training requirements are based on the pilot's experience level on the last
   day of the current training cycle.
   1.6.9. Units converting to another mission-design-series (MDS) may fly pilots in CMR
   positions at the BMC rate until one month prior to the operationally ready date if the CMR
   sortie rates cannot be supported. CMR pilots should be flown at a CMR rate for the month
   prior to initial operational capability (IOC). Active duty wings converting to new MDS are
   authorized one SQ equivalent (7/6 for 24/18 or less PAI) of additional API-6’s during the
   conversion period. However, total wing staff flying the new aircraft shall not exceed total
   authorized for final conversion equipage.
1.7. Training Program Development:
   1.7.1. RAP mission/sortie and event requirements (see Attachment 2 for definitions) apply to
   CMR and BMC pilots as well as those carrying special capabilities or qualifications and are
   IAW the RAP Tasking Memorandum (RTM). The standard mission requirements, contained
   in the RTM, establish the minimum number of missions per training cycle for BMC and
   CMR levels of training. The RTM takes precedence over this volume, and will contain
   updated mission requirements and/ or missions/events not yet incorporated in Attachment 2.
   The RTM dictates what SIM missions/ events will be logged as RAP missions/events and
   what currencies will be updated in the SIM. The RTM will dictate what number of RAP SIM
   missions will be used for lookback. The RTM applies to all F-15 pilots.
   1.7.2. BAQ requirements are different from BMC or CMR requirements. These
   requirements ensure basic pilot skills are maintained (see the RTM). The basic BAQ
   requirements are incorporated into BMC and CMR requirements and can be viewed as the
   traditional ―non-RAP‖ requirements. ―Non-RAP‖ requirements no longer exist since all
   requirements are contained in one sortie/mission table (in the RTM) and in one event table
   (Training Cycle Event Requirements Table of the RTM).
   1.7.3. Experiencing/Collateral mission requirements must be considered when developing
   unit flying hour programs.
      1.7.3.1. Experiencing sorties are additional training sorties necessary to achieve desired
      proficiency in optimum time. RAP sorties may not provide sufficient hours to experience
      pilots to achieve overall unit experience levels. The USAF sets a required number of
      hours to experience pilots and a percentage goal of the unit pilots that should meet these
      requirements.
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                  13


       1.7.3.2. Collateral sorties are not directly related to combat employment training but are
       necessary in day to day unit operations. These include but are not limited to functional
       check flights, ferry flights, incentive/orientation flights, deployments, and air shows. For
       the annual training cycle, the MAJCOM may allocate a block of sorties to the unit for
       these purposes.
   1.7.4. Unit flying hour programs are allocated a number of attrition sorties that compensate
   for non-effective training sorties. Non-effective sorties are logged when a training sortie is
   planned, but a major portion of valid training for that type of mission is not accomplished
   due to poor weather, air aborts, etc. In order to accurately allocate the number of attrition
   sorties, it is essential that non-effective sorties are logged appropriately.
1.8. Training Records and Reports:
   1.8.1. Units will maintain pilot records for individual training and evaluations IAW:
       1.8.1.1. AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training
       1.8.1.2. AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program
       1.8.1.3. AFI 11-401.
   1.8.2. Track the following information for all pilots (as applicable):
       1.8.2.1. Ground training.
       1.8.2.2. Requirements and accomplishment of individual sorties, RAP sorties, sortie
       types, and events cumulatively for the training cycle.
       1.8.2.3. RAP sortie requirements and accomplishment using 1-month and 3-month
       running totals for look-back.
       1.8.2.4. Currencies:
       1.8.2.5. Weapons employment records in sufficient detail to document all employment
       attempts.
   1.8.3. Units may fill in ARMS with either the date of the last FTU or United States Air Force
   Weapons School (USAFWS) equivalent training accomplished, or the unit mission
   certification date.
1.9. Armament Recording:
   1.9.1. Pilots will use and assess all available training documentation such as air combat
   maneuvering instrumentation (ACMI), aircraft video tape recorder (AVTR) tapes and/or
   Digital Video Recorder (DVR) images for radar, heads-up display (HUD), Joint Helmet
   Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), situation displays, or any other important data on all
   tactical missions. Pilots will review their data with their flight/element member(s).
   1.9.2. As a guide, the following items should be reviewed: titling, weapons parameters,
   accuracy, identification procedures, adherence to Training Rules (TRs), communications
   procedures and discipline, flight discipline, proper Anti-G Straining Maneuver IAW
   paragraph 6.4.2.5., tactical employment, and instrument approaches.
1.10. Pilot Utilization Policy:
 14                                                      AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010


   1.10.1. Commanders will ensure wing/group tactical pilots (API -1/6s) fill authorized
   positions IAW unit manning documents and that pilot status is properly designated. The
   overall objective is that pilots perform combat-related duties. Supervisors may assign pilots
   to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, flight evaluation board (FEB)/mishap board
   member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of pilot tasking,
   flying proficiency, currency, and experience. For inexperienced pilots in the first year of their
   initial operational assignment, supervisors should limit the non-flying duties to those related
   to combat activities.
   1.10.2. Duties required by various publications that may be assigned to CAF API -1 pilots
   are weapons and tactics officer, programmer, flight safety officer, supervisor of flying (SOF),
   mobility/ contingency plans, training (except ARMS documentation), SQ
   Standardization/Evaluation Liaison Officer (SELO), squadron aircrew flight equipment
   officer, electronic combat pilot, and other duties directly related to flying operations (runway
   operations monitor [ROM], range control officer [RCO], etc.). In some instances, such as
   squadron-assigned flight safety officers, API -1s may be attached to the wing. API -1s will
   not be attached to wing staffs or man wing staff positions unless total wing pilot API -1
   manning is 100 percent or better. CCs will ensure wing staff pilots (API -6s) perform duties
   justified in MAJCOM manpower standards documents and authorized in UMDs.
1.11. Sortie Allocation Guidance:
   1.11.1. Inexperienced API -1 pilots should receive sortie allocation priority over experienced
   pilots. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows:
      1.11.1.1. Formal Training Units and USAFWS. Formal syllabus training, Instructor
      Upgrade, Instructor CT, authorized staff personnel not performing Instructor or FE duties
      (to include API-5 pilot-physicians not on instructor orders).
      1.11.1.2. Combined Formal Training and Operational Units. Formal syllabus
      training, CMR API -1, MQT API -1, CMR API -6, MQT API -6, BMC, API -5 pilot
      physicians, others.
      1.11.1.3. Operational Units. CMR API -1, MQT API -1, CMR API -6, MQT API -6,
      and BMC (to include API -5 pilot physicians).
      1.11.1.4. Test and Test Evaluation Squadron (TES) Units. Requirements directed by
      MAJCOM, training required to prepare for assigned projects/tasking, BMC training
      requirements that cannot be accomplished on primary missions, API-5 pilot physicians.
   1.11.2. Wing API -6 authorizations are IAW unit manning documents.
   1.11.3. For FTU only wings, all API -6 pilots will maintain instructor status (optional for
   WG/ OG CC, functional check flight (FCF) pilots, and one other). These wings will fly API -
   1/6 pilots as required by programmed flying training (PFT). For wings consisting of both
   FTU and operational units, at least one of the following pilots will maintain formal IP status:
   WG/CC, WG/CV, OG/CC, and OG/CD.
   1.11.4. API-8 rated personnel flying authorizations, ACC/IGS inspectors in API-6 billets and
   Test Unit aircrews will be IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance. API-8 pilots should fly
   the BMC rate, however they are not required to complete BMC specific missions/events or
   meet monthly look-back requirements. API-8 pilots will fly at least the BAQ mission/sortie
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                15


    and event requirements. Test unit pilots will fly the BMC sortie rate as a minimum and will
    meet monthly BMC lookback. Units should provide assigned API 6/8 flyers adequate
    resources to maintain minimum training requirements. However, API-6 flyer support will not
    come at the expense of the flying squadron's primary mission. API-6 flyers will accomplish
    training requirements with allotted BMC sorties or MTC missions. API-8/ACC/IGS flyers
    will strive to accomplish all mission and event requirements with allotted BMC sorties or
    MTC missions. If attached units cannot meet attached flyer requirements, they must request
    relief IAW AFI 11-401, as supplemented. Units requiring flying hour adjustments for
    attached API-8 and applicable API-6 flyers must request program changes IAW MAJCOM
    directives.
    1.11.5. (ANG: N/A) There is no maximum sortie requirement for CMR pilots. Table 1.1.
    defines the maximum sortie requirements for other pilots. On occasion, unique operations
    may require pilots to fly more than the maximum number of sorties authorized, however, this
    may impact training of other pilots.
    1.11.6. Pilots assigned or attached to ACC/IGS as API-6s will maintain RAP currencies
    /lookback per API-8 guidance.

                           INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines Initial Qualification Training (IQT) of pilots into unit
aircraft. IQT includes Basic (B course) and transition/re-qualification/senior officer (TX) training
and normally will be conducted during formal syllabus courses at formal training unit (FTU)
squadron whenever possible. In exceptional circumstances, when FTU training is not available
within a reasonable time period, IQT may be conducted at the local unit IAW provisions of this
chapter. This local IQT will normally be conducted using appropriate formal USAF Transition or
Re-qualification Training Course syllabus tracks, flow programs, and requirements. When local
IQT is authorized, the gaining MAJCOM assumes responsibility for the burden of providing this
training locally. The following guidance applies only to other than formal course IQT.
2.2. Approval/Waiver for IQT:
   2.2.1. MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3T) is approval authority to conduct local IQT, and
   (ANG: ACC/ A3G) is waiver authority to change the formal requirements of locally
   conducted IQT. Info HQ ACC/ A3T.
   2.2.2. MAJCOM/CC (ANG: ACC/CG) is the approval authority for non-formal course IQT
   for Colonel selects and above to be conducted at the unit to which the officer is assigned.
   2.2.3. Requests to conduct local IQT will include the following:

   qualification and instrument evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2F-15,Volume 2, F-
   15--Aircrew Evaluation Criteria).
2.3. Prerequisites. Course prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course syllabus
and the USAF Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA).
2.4. Ground Training. Ground training may be tailored to the individual’s background and
experience or peculiar local conditions. However, available and current reference materials such
as AFTTP 3-3, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals, instructor guides, and audiovisual programs
should be used as supporting materials to the maximum extent possible. Simulator missions may
be accomplished in a Full Mission Trainer (FMT), weapons and tactics trainer (WTT), cockpit
familiarization trainer (CFT) or cockpit procedures trainer (CPT) if the ViWS’s are not available
in the MTC.

   and estimated completion date.
   2.5.3. Pilots in IQT will fly under IP supervision (dual or chased) until completing the
   qualification checkride.
   2.5.4. Formal course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements for
   IQT. However, additional training events, based on student proficiency and background, may
   be incorporated into the IQT program with authorization of the SQ/CC. Additional training
   due to student non-progression is available within the constraints of the formal course
   syllabus and may be added at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
   2.5.5. Combat Edge familiarization flight training (if unit is equipped) will be conducted
   before other high-G flight maneuvers are accomplished.
2.6. IQT for Senior Officers:
   2.6.1. All formal training courses for senior officers (colonel selects and above) will be
   conducted at the FTUs unless waived IAW paragraph 2.2.
   2.6.2. Senior officers must meet course entry prerequisites and will complete all syllabus
   requirements unless waived IAW syllabus and paragraph 2.2.
   2.6.3. If senior officers must be trained at the installation to which they are assigned, they
   will be in formal training status. Unit duties will be turned over to appropriate deputies or
   vice commanders until training is completed. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by
   MAJCOM/CC (For ANG: ACC/ CG).

                          MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. Mission Qualification Training (MQT) is a unit developed training program that
upgrades newly assigned pilots to BMC or CMR to accomplish the unit mission. Guidance in
this chapter is provided to assist the SQ/CCs in developing their MQT program. MQT should not
be built as a validation of FTU course phases. The SQ/CC is responsible for developing the unit
specific MQT program and the OG/CC will approve for use. Units are allowed to further tailor
their program for all pilots, based on current qualification, experience, currency, documented
performance, and formal training. Applicable portions of MQT may be used to create a re-
qualification program for pilots who have regressed from BMC or CMR, to specifically address
deficiencies which caused regression.
   3.1.1. MQT will be completed within 90 calendar days (ANG: 120 calendar days). Timing
   starts at the pilot's first duty day at the gaining operational unit. If a pilot elects to take leave
   prior to entering MQT, the timing will begin after the termination of the pilot's leave.
   Training is complete upon SQ/ CC certification to CMR/BMC. Notify MAJCOM/A3T if
   delay beginning MQT due to security clearance exceeds 30 days. If training exceeds the
   specified limit, units will notify MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G).
   3.1.2. The following CMR/BMC training items are granted grace periods for completion
   after MQT; failure to comply will result in regression to N-CMR/N-BMC until training is
   complete. AAR and night training accomplished in IQT may fulfill MQT requirements as
   determined by the SQ/CC. Night MQT should be flown with NVGs if the upgrading pilot is
   already NVG qualified. All night training requires demonstrated proficiency and currency in
   similar day events, unless accomplished dual with an IP. Unaccomplished AAR and night
   training will be accomplished NLT 90 days (ANG: 180 days) from completion of MQT.
   3.1.3. Pilots in MQT will not fly in FLAG-level exercises, or Weapon System Evaluation
   Program (WSEP). The OG/ CC will determine MQT participation in other exercises.
   3.1.4. Prior to CMR certification, if not accomplished during FTU training, pilots must
   complete low altitude step-down training (LASDT) and initially qualify in all weapons
   delivery/employment events required QUAL at CMR/BMC.
3.2. Ground Training:
   3.2.1. Units will develop blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to their mission as
   determined by the SQ/CC. Training accomplished during IQT may be credited towards this
   requirement.
   3.2.2. Pilots transferring from another MAJCOM require the theater-specific portions of
   instrument refresher course (IRC) before flying without a theater-experienced pilot in the
   formation. MQT academics and the MQT local area orientation (LAO) mission may satisfy
   this requirement.
   3.2.3. Initial Verification: Initial verification will be completed within 90 days (ANG: 180
   days) after completing MQT. Suggested briefing guide is at Attachment 3. Each pilot (not
   required for BMC) will demonstrate to a formal board a satisfactory knowledge of the
   squadron’s assigned mission. Board composition will be established by the SQ/CC). Desired

   composition is SQ/CC or SQ/DO (chairman), weapons, electronic combat, intelligence, and
   plans representatives.
3.3. Simulator Training:
   3.3.1. ViWS’s in the MTC will be used on SIM MQT-1 and -4 if available. If unavailable,
   SIM MQT-1, -2, and -3 may be combined into one or more CFT/CPT/FMT/WTT Static
   aircraft missions to accomplish appropriate switchology and emergency procedures training.
   SIM MQT-2 and -3 may be flown in the WTT. MQT pilots should fly the missions outlined
   below (ANG: locally developed SIM profiles). Each training device mission will include
   selected emergency procedures and unusual attitude/inadvertent weather entry procedures.
   During emergency procedure (EP) SIM missions, departure recognition and recovery
   procedures will be accomplished to include both autoroll and spin recoveries. SIM MQT-1 is
   a prerequisite for the first MQT flight.
   3.3.2. MQT SIM Profiles:
       3.3.2.1. SIM MQT-1--Local Area Orientation/Instruments. Normal ground
       operations, standard departure(s), navigation, emergency airfield procedures and
       approaches, published penetration and approach to primary alternates and home base,
       emergency divert procedures, EPs.
       3.3.2.2. SIM MQT-2--Tactical Intercepts. Alert scramble and launch procedures;

       employment; separation/egress; wounded bird procedures; recovery and landing.
       3.3.2.5. SIM MQT-5--Emergency Procedures Evaluation (If Required). This
       evaluation will be administered by a FE IAW MAJCOM and unit directives.
3.4. Flying Training. The appropriate missions from those listed below will be used to upgrade
to BMC and CMR. Unit-developed MQT programs should use profiles typical of squadron
missions. Maximum use of armament recording assets and captive missiles is encouraged on all
MQT missions.
   3.4.1. Supervision. A FL-qualified SQ supervisor or IP in the element is required unless
   specified otherwise. On some sorties, more specific guidance is provided. The SQ/CC will
   determine the proper flight position of the supervisor/IP unless specified otherwise.
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               21


  3.4.2. If more than 14 calendar days elapse between sorties, an additional review sortie will
  be flown before continuing in the program.
  3.4.3. All pilots must conduct practice airborne emergency procedures training during any
  one of the MQT sorties. As a minimum, the training will consist of briefing, flying, and
  debriefing a simulated critical action procedures scenario, to include airborne coordination
  with the SOF.
  3.4.4. Sortie Requirements. The Mission Evaluation Checkride, flown IAW AFI 11-
  202V2 and AFI 11-2F-15V2 is mandatory, if not previously accomplished in the MQT

     the unit's primary mission tasking.
  3.4.6. Low Altitude Step-Down Training (LASDT):
     3.4.6.1. To conduct low altitude operations safely, pilots need to be knowledgeable of
     aircraft handling and performance characteristics, tactical formation, intercept, offensive
     maneuvering and defensive reactions, and navigation. The low altitude environment
     requires a well-supervised LASDT program, including initial certification and currency
     requirements. LASDT qualifies pilots to conduct low altitude training (LOWAT) in the
     block 500 feet to 1,000 feet AGL. LOWAT block certification is required prior to
     performing unsupervised operations in that low altitude block.
     3.4.6.2. LASDT missions will be supervised by an IP or FL-qualified squadron
     supervisor who has completed LASDT training and is current.
     3.4.6.3. Demonstrated proficiency down to 500 feet AGL is required for LOWAT
     qualification and is normally accomplished during IQT. Units may accept a transfer
     pilot's LOWAT qualification from previous IQT or MQT. LOWAT qualification is a
     requirement for CMR status.
     3.4.6.4. Entry into LASDT (other than at FTU) requires SQ/CC approval. Upon
     successful completion of LASDT training, the SQ/CC will certify the pilot LOWAT
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              23


     qualified. Squadrons may accept documented LASDT certification for pilots coming
     from other units/ commands. With SQ/CC approval, low altitude training conducted at a
     formal course may be used to fulfill applicable requirements of this paragraph.
     3.4.6.5. LASDT will be scheduled and briefed as a primary portion of the mission.
     Compatible RAP CT sorties and events may be accomplished in conjunction with
     LASDT as long as the objectives of LASDT training are met. LASDT training will not
     be accomplished on an alternate mission. IPs/FLs must be aware of the added stress
     and task loading associated with low altitude operations and provide breaks in training
     above the training altitude. Develop training profiles to avoid over-tasking the upgrading
     pilot, and upgrade sortie continuity should be emphasized.
     3.4.6.6. TR’s will be IAW AFI 11-214, Aircrew and Weapons Director Procedures for
     Air Operations; and AFI 11-2F-15, Volume 3, F-15--Operations Procedures. During
     LASDT, KIOs will include a climb to above 1000 feet AGL.
     3.4.6.7. An IP or squadron supervisor, in the element, will supervise all sorties.
     3.4.6.8. Ground Training. LASDT training. Coverage should support the mission and
     concept of operations of the squadron, incorporating appropriate portions of AFTTP 3-1,
     and AFFTP 3-3. Complete all academic training prior to flight training/briefing.
        3.4.6.8.1. AHC. Discuss aircraft performance as it applies to the low altitude
        environment, to include: control response (low/high speed, over-G potential, speed
        brake use, stores effects); afterburner (fuel considerations, selection techniques),
        acceleration/ deceleration, level turns, vertical maneuvering, climb/dive/slice,
        recoveries, effects of gross weight/ CFT, power settings, density altitude, G-loading,
        and bank angles; terrain avoidance (ridge crossings), HUD use, terrain clearance
        versus turning room, dangers inherent in over-banking during turns, importance of
        frequent cross check of aircraft attitude relative to horizon, and any available
        computer-based depictions of LOWAT dangers; use the media "How Low Can You
        Go?", or equivalent if available.
        3.4.6.8.2. Environmental Factors. Discuss out-of-cockpit visibility and FOV
        restrictions, sun angle, terrain and G-excess-illusions/perceptions, WX
        considerations, and HUD use.
        3.4.6.8.3. Task   Management. Discuss            low     altitude   tasks    and   task
        management/prioritization concept.
        3.4.6.8.4. Low Altitude Tactical Formation (LATF). Discuss formations
        (including line abreast and wedge), hazards at low altitudes, task prioritization,
        tactical turns, visual lookout/ mutual support.
        3.4.6.8.5. Defensive Reactions. Discuss visual lookout and mutual support, threat

          satisfactory completion of this mission, the SQ/CC can certify the pilot LOWAT
          qualified.
3.5. Initial Aircrew Chemical Defense Training (ACDT). (N/A for CB/TF-coded and ANG
ADF units) ACDT is designed to ensure pilot proficiency in the overall use of the Aircrew
Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE) and to familiarize pilots with combat capabilities while
wearing ACDE. Pilots must complete Initial ACDT NLT 90 days (ANG: 180 days) from MQT
completion. Initial ACDT affects CMR/BMC, but is non-grounding. All initial ACDT is to be
accomplished prior to the first ACDE flight. Pilots will be ACDE certified upon the completion
of initial ACDT. Pilots who accomplished initial ACDT in previous tours in a fighter type MDS
are not required to reaccomplish the ACDE Flight.
   3.5.1. Ground Training. All pilots will complete required mobility ancillary training.
   Aircrew Chemical Defense Training/ACDT (LL04) initial, CT refresher, Egress Training
   with ACDE (LL05) are IAW AFI 11-301, and Emergency Parachute Training with ACDE
   are IAW AFI 16-1301, Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) Program, will be
   accomplished once in a career (per MDS). See Ground Training Table (see the RTM) for
   currency requirements and reference instructions.
   3.5.2. Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE) SIM. A SIM mission in full ACDE
   gear (anti-exposure suit liner may be substituted), harness, and G-suit. Within the mission
   profile, practice doffing simulated contaminated equipment. An ACDE SIM mission may use
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                   25


   existing SIM mission profiles and count toward TAC SIM training cycle requirements. Units
   will use their best available simulator or actual aircraft cockpit for ACDE SIM training. The
   ACDE SIM will be accomplished once in a career (per MDS), and should be conducted as
   close as possible to the day before (but not more than 30 days prior) to the ACDE flight.
   3.5.3. Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE) Flight. The ACDE flight will be
   accomplished once in a career (unless previously accomplished in a fighter type MDS).
   Flight training must consider limitations of operating while wearing ACDE. Full donning and
   doffing procedures/ sequence will be practiced in conjunction with the ACDE flight but the
   only ACDE worn inflight will be mask, filter pack, and gloves.
   3.5.4. ACDE Flight Restrictions:
      3.5.4.1. Pilots will be fully current and qualified in an event prior to accomplishing that
      event on an ACDE flight.
      3.5.4.2. Minimum formation spacing is route unless fingertip is required for safe mission
      accomplishment (i.e., WX penetration).
      3.5.4.3. Minimum altitude is 500 feet AGL except takeoffs, approaches and landings.
      3.5.4.4. No night sorties. AAR requires an IP in the flight.
      3.5.4.5. Weather minimums are 1500 feet ceiling and 3 miles (4.8 km) visibility for
      pilots wearing ACDE.
      3.5.4.6. Dual cockpit operations will be used to the maximum extent possible with a
      safety observer, qualified in the aircraft, not wearing ACDE in the rear cockpit. Solo
      operations will be supervised by an ACDE qualified FL from a chase position.
      Formations, to include chase, are limited to two-ship and only one pilot in the element
      will be wearing ACDE unless both aircraft are dual with an experienced pilot in each
      RCP. Pilots wearing ACDE gear will not fly in dissimilar formations.
      3.5.4.7. Operations supervision should not conduct ACDE flying training when, in their
      judgment, temperature/dew point conditions are not favorable to safe operations.
      3.5.4.8. Due to physical incompatibility between the JHMCS visor and the pilot's CW
      mask, ICWT will not be conducted with the JHMCS display unit (DU) attached to the
      helmet until an alternative to the current visor fitting process is developed. The traditional
      55P helmet is the preferable option for the ACDE sortie, if available, until JHMCS
      ACDE compatibility is achieved.
3.6. Flight Surgeon:
   3.6.1. Ground Training. Flight surgeons who are assigned to units and who have not
   previously flown the unit-assigned aircraft will accomplish the following before the initial
   flight briefing: Aircraft general review; hanging harness training (as applicable); egress
   training, protective equipment training; applicable testing, AGSM training (to include the
   review of "Anti-G Strain Technique Reinforcement and Assessment"), and an instrument/EP
   simulator (if available) with an instructor (1 hour minimum). CRM is a onetime per MDS
   requirement for FS that will be accomplished prior to first flight (OG waiverable).
   3.6.2. Flight Training. The first flight in the unit-assigned aircraft will be with an IP and
   may be flown in conjunction with other training sorties. The briefing and sortie will

4.2. Ground Training. Ground training will be accomplished IAW the Ground Training
Table (see the RTM). Waiver authority for the ground training specified is IAW the reference
directive. Ground training accomplished during IQT/MQT may be credited toward CT
requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished. This list is intended to be a
single source reference for MDS-specific ground training only. This list does not include non-
MDS specific ancillary training. Training should be tracked in ARMS. Where discrepancies
exist, the reference directive takes precedence.
   4.2.1. Simulator (SIM): The Training Cycle Event Requirements Table in the RTM depicts
   the minimum EP and TAC SIM training requirements to be accomplished in the best
   available simulator. SQ/CC will determine the required supervision for CT SIM missions,
   based on SIM capabilities, and mission training objectives. Units should develop scenarios
   that cover both EP and tactical MTCs based on expected employment tasking and general
   systems knowledge requirements. Emphasis should be placed on training not easily or not
   attainable during live flying. Units will update scenarios as required.
       4.2.1.1. EP SIM missions will accomplish the following at least once in each training
       cycle: unusual attitude recoveries, spatial disorientation, inadvertent weather entry,
       controlled flight departure recognition and recovery procedures, controlled and
       uncontrolled ejection parameters, aircraft subsystem failure checklist procedures, relevant
       critical action procedures, and precision instrument procedures.
       4.2.1.2. TAC SIM missions will accomplish the following at least once in each training
       cycle: DOC relevant combat employment, threat recognition/reaction and counter tactics,
       system failure procedures, critical action procedures, departure recognition and recovery,
       and controlled/uncontrolled ejection parameters.
       4.2.1.3. EP missions will be accomplished in the MTC or FMT. If a unit does not have
       access to an MTC or FMT, EP missions will be accomplished in the WTT.
   4.2.2. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT).
       4.2.2.1. An SEPT must be accomplished once per month. It can be accomplished by
       table top or SIM. Review abnormal/emergency procedures and aircraft systems
       operations/limitations. Use realistic scenarios and carry EPs to a logical conclusion.
       Critical action procedures and squadron special interest items should be emphasized.
       Incorporate the following into squadron SEPT programs:
          4.2.2.1.1. SQ/CC/DO involvement in the selection of a monthly SEPT topic.
          4.2.2.1.2. Develop SEPT scenarios using actual mishaps/incidents.
          4.2.2.1.3. Discuss at least two EPs for each phase of flight.
          4.2.2.1.4. Accomplish two SEPTs each training cycle with an IP or SQ supervisor to
          include min fuel and emergency divert training, and mid-air collision avoidance in all
          phases of flight.
       4.2.2.2. An SEPT will be accomplished for the month a pilot is flying. Currency will
       expire at the end of the calendar month. An SEPT may be accomplished the month prior,
       but will only count for one month (i.e. an SEPT accomplished at the end of May can
       count for June, but June only.) A pilot is grounded until the SEPT is completed for that
       month.
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                29


     4.2.2.3. Table top SEPTs should be accomplished with at least two pilots. Keep groups
     small and ensure all members participate.
     4.2.2.4. Completion of a simulator EP profile satisfies the monthly SEPT requirement.
     For IP/ FE, administering the SEPT/EP Sim will satisfy their SEPT requirement.
  4.2.3. Weapons/Tactics Academic Training. Units will establish a weapons/ tactics
  academic training program to satisfy MQT and CT requirements. Training is required in each
  training cycle. Audio-visual programs may be used in place of academic instruction.
  Successful completion of the program requires an examination (85% minimum). Use
  additional testing to validate qualification to the maximum extent. Pilots who score at least
  85% may receive credit in lieu of ground CT where authorized by governing regulations.
     4.2.3.1. Academic instructors should be USAFWS graduates or have attended WIC
     academics.
     4.2.3.2. Instruction and tests should include (as applicable), but are not limited to:
         4.2.3.2.1. Air-to-air weapons description, operation, parameters, fusing, limitations,
         preflight, tactics, normal and emergency procedures/techniques.
         4.2.3.2.2. ACBT. Principles of aerodynamics, maneuverability, AHC, formations,

         the academic outline in paragraph 6.8.
  4.2.4. Verification:
     4.2.4.1. The purpose of Verification is to update pilots on their DOC tasked mission.
     Each pilot will participate in a squadron initial/continuation Verification as a briefer,
     board member, or seminar participant. Pilots who participate in a unit deployment to a
     tasked theater of operations may receive credit for continuation verification.
         4.2.4.1.1. BMC pilots should accomplish an initial Verification and/or participate in
         continuation Verifications to facilitate future upgrade to CMR status, at the discretion
         of the SQ/CC.
  4.2.5. US/Russia Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities. (For NORAD tasked
  ASA units) Initial, annual refresher, and pre-deployment training for the prevention of
  Dangerous Military Activities will be conducted to ensure that all pilots are familiar with the
  agreement and the implementing provisions contained in CJCSI 23-11.01, , Implementation
  Procedures for the Agreement between the United States and Russia on the prevention of

   between the U.S. and Russia section of the Flight Information Handbook.
4.3. Flying Training. All pilots except API-8 and ACC/IGS inspectors will accomplish the
requirements in the Training Cycle Event Requirements Table via the current RTM. API-8
flyers and ACC/IGS inspectors should attempt, but are not required, to accomplish the events on
the Training Cycle Event Requirements Table. Failure to accomplish these requirements may not
affect BAQ, BMC, or CMR status but may require additional training as determined by the
SQ/CC. In addition, the BAQ/BMC/CMR guidance from paragraph 4.1. and the following are
required:
   4.3.1. Special Capabilities/Qualification Requirements:

       Requirements Table (see the RTM), as applicable, and the BAQ Instrument and AHC
       mission/sortie requirements found in the RAP Tasking Memo. In addition to RAP
       missions, formal training syllabus-directed missions and approved test plan missions
       apply to the BMC rate requirement for TF or CB coded units respectively. For
       instructors, failure to accomplish these requirements will not affect instructor status, but
       will require additional training as determined by the SQ/CC prior to performing instructor
       duties in the delinquent events.
          4.3.2.1.1. Pilots assigned/attached to CB-coded units and the 475 WEG need not
          maintain IP status.

   4.5.1. ACC/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3) may authorize qualification in more than one mission
   design series (MDS) aircraft for pilots only when such action is directed by command
   mission requirements and is economically justifiable. This authority cannot be delegated
   below MAJCOM level. Unless required for unit mission accomplishment, commanders must
   not permit pilots qualified in primary mission aircraft to maintain qualification in support
   aircraft. Individuals assigned to positions covered by paragraph 4.5.2. have ACC/A3
   approval, and do not need to submit specific requests.
      4.5.1.1. Submit multiple qualification requests through command channels to ACC/A3
      (ANG: NGB/A3). All requests must contain full justification. Approval for multiple
      qualification request must be provided to the appropriate host installation aviation
      management office; flight accomplishments are not authorized until aircraft assignment is
      updated into ARMS.
      4.5.1.2. Individually authorized multiple qualifications are valid as long as the individual
      is assigned to the specific position, and aircraft requested, or until rescinded by the
      approval authority.
   4.5.2. Paragraph 4.5. does not apply to F-15A/B and C/D aircraft. F-15A/B and F-15C/D are
   considered the same MDS.
   4.5.3. Multiple qualification is not appropriate for senior wing supervisors of units with
   different types of aircraft. Wing commanders will qualify in only one of their wing's aircraft;
   the Wing/CV or OG/CC should qualify in another of the wing's aircraft (not the same one
   selected by the WG/CC).
   4.5.4. Multiple Requirements. Pilots will satisfy at least 50 percent of the sortie
   requirements of their primary aircraft in that aircraft. If CMR, they will meet all RAP
   sortie/event requirements of the primary aircraft. In addition, pilots will fly an equitable
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                  33


   distribution of emergency patterns, instrument sorties, penetrations, non-precision
   approaches, and precision approaches in each MDS to fill their Training Cycle Event
   Requirements Table (see the RTM).
   4.5.5. Multiple Currencies. Pilots will fly at least once each 45 days in each aircraft. They
   will comply with all other currency requirements for each aircraft.
   4.5.6. Pilots must complete conversion training IAW an approved syllabus.
4.6. Currencies/Re-currencies/Re-qualification:
   4.6.1. Currency. Table 4.1 defines currency requirements for all F-15 A/B/C/D pilots. If a
   pilot loses a particular currency, that sortie/event may not be performed except for the
   purpose of regaining currency as noted.
   4.6.2. Re-currency is required whenever a pilot exceeds a currency requirement in this
   volume.
      4.6.2.1. Overdue training requirements must be satisfied before the pilot is considered
      qualified to perform tasks applicable to the type of training in which delinquent. Training
      annotated as affecting CMR status will require regression to N-CMR status until
      appropriate training as specified by SQ/ CC is accomplished. Training identified as not
      affecting CMR status does not require regression from CMR status although it may result
      in grounding until training is completed (e.g., life support training). The duration of
      grounding and status of sortie lookback will determine the effect on CMR status.
      4.6.2.2. Unless otherwise specified, supervisory requirements pertaining to recurrency
      may be satisfied in the cockpit or flight position that offers the best control of the
      mission, as determined by the SQ/CC.
   4.6.3. MAJCOM/AOS Currency Requirements. Units will comply with AFI 11-207,
   Combat Aircraft Delivery, for additional currencies required for the flight delivery of aircraft
   coordinated through MAJCOM/AOS.
   4.6.4. Landing/Sortie Recurrency:
      4.6.4.1. Loss of landing/sortie currency requires the following action (timing starts from
      the last landing):
          4.6.4.1.1. 31-90 Days (46-90 Days - Experienced). Regain landing currency.
          4.6.4.1.2. 91-135 Days. Same as above, plus instructor supervised SIM (tactics,
          normal and emergency procedures for CMR pilots; normal, instrument, and
          emergency procedures for BMC pilots).
          4.6.4.1.3. 136-210 (225 for Experienced pilots) Days. Same as above, plus
          (CMR/BMC) closed and open qualification examinations and an EPE evaluation.
          4.6.4.1.4. 211 (Inexperienced) / 226 (Experienced) or More Days. IQT, landing
          recurrency, LASDT re-qualification, and appropriate weapons event initial
          qualification.
   4.6.5. ACBT:
      4.6.5.1. Pilots losing currency in ACBT must accomplish the following sorties:
 34                                                      AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010


          4.6.5.1.1. 61-90 Days (91-120 Experienced). BFM.
          4.6.5.1.2. 91-180 Days (121-180 Experienced). AHC, and BFM.
          4.6.5.1.3. Over 180 Days. Re-accomplish a tailored program IAW Chapter 3.
   4.6.6. JHMCS Recurrency:
       4.6.6.1. Pilots losing currency in JHMCS must accomplish the following sorties:
          4.6.6.1.1. 121-180 Days (181-240 Experienced). BFM.
          4.6.6.1.2. Over 180 Days (240 Experienced). Re-accomplish a tailored program
          IAW Chapter 6.
   4.6.7. Loss of/Re-qualification to IP Status. IPs will be decertified if:
       4.6.7.1. Failure of a Flight Check. To regain IP status, the IP must successfully complete
       a flight check IAW AFI 11-202V2, and AFI 11-2F-15V2.
       4.6.7.2. Failure of an INST/QUAL open book test. To regain IP status, the IP must
       successfully re-accomplish the written exam.
       4.6.7.3. Expiration of instructor currency To regain status, see Table 4.1.
       4.6.7.4. Loss of CMR/BMC status due to loss of currency in an event/sortie and the
       SQ/CC deems decertification is required. If the SQ/CC does not elect this option or if the
       instructor becomes non-current in events/sorties that do not require removal from
       CMR/BMC status, instructor status may be retained, but the IP will not instruct in that
       event/sortie until the required currency is regained.
   4.6.8. NVG Re-currency. Pilots losing NVG currency must accomplish the following
   events plus conduct an academic refresher prior to unrestricted night operations:
       4.6.8.1. 2-ship basic formation work / light drills and unit specific mission elements.
       4.6.8.2. Tactical turns and maneuvers.
       4.6.8.3. Minimum of one intercept IAW NVG-2 profile not to exceed 1v1.

NOTES:

1. See Attachment 2 for demanding/non-demanding sortie definitions. In addition, BAQ pilots
will fly in a supervised status (with a SQ supervisor or IP) any time a non-demanding sortie is
required.

2. Re-currency supervision level will be SQ supervisor or instructor, in the aircraft or chase,
qualified and current in the Event. To regain RCP IP landing currency, FCP must be occupied
by a BMC/ CMR pilot current and qualified in landing.

3. Supervision will be SQ supervisor or instructor, qualified and current in the event. For NVG
currency, supervision will be an NVG current, qualified pilot in aircraft or current, qualified SQ
supervisor or instructor in the element.

4. Performance or instruction will update CT ACBT currency. Performance or instruction of
LOW A/A will update CT LOW A/A currency.

5. Flight leaders may update currency from either lead or wing position. Recurrency will be
accomplished from wing position. Wingmen may only update currency from wing position.

6. LOW A/A - Event is defined as performing realistic, mission oriented air-to-air operations
while in a LOWAT certified low altitude block (at or below 1000 ft AGL over land). Event
includes skills necessary to seek out, and engage offensively, an aerial target at low altitude. For
the F-15A/ B/C/D, this event also includes low altitude navigation, tactical formation, defensive
maneuvering to avoid or negate threats.
 36                                                        AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010



7. Currency is required in the pilots low altitude category for operations below 1000 feet. Loss
of currency requires pilots to operate above 1000’ AGL. Re-currency requires satisfactory
performance in the following events: vertical awareness training, hard turns, tactical formation
and defensive maneuvering.

8. Instructor pilot currency is 60 days. Non-currency for 61-180 days requires an instructor re-
currency flight with an IP; over 180 days requires a Stan/Eval flight check. IP rear cockpit
landing currency is 45 days. F-15 FWIC student sorties count as instructor sorties for currency.
Performing as an instructor in the MTC on an upgrade will update currency.

9.    An NVG academic review is required prior to the recurrency sortie.

10. For IPs, accomplishing or instructing the event from either C/P will update currency.

11. If non-current in precision approaches, increase the pilot weather minimum by one category.
If day VFR, the supervision level is a pilot, current and qualified in the event; all other times
require an IP IAW AFI 11-202 V3. Currency can be updated in the MTC, and pilots may regain
their currency in an MTC on a case-by-case basis with SQ/CC approval.

4.7. Regression.
     4.7.1. CMR/BMC Regression for Failure to Meet Lookback. Only RAP training and
     Contingency Operations missions may be used for lookback. If a pilot does not meet
     lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, SQ/CCs can either regress the pilot to
     N-CMR/N-BMC status, as applicable; remove the pilot from a CMR manning position; or
     initiate action to remove the pilot from active flying status.
         4.7.1.1. Failure to meet 1-month RAP/Contingency Operations mission lookback
         requires a review of the pilot's 3-month mission history. If the 3-month lookback has
         been met, the pilot may, at SQ/CC discretion, remain in CMR/BMC status. Failure to
         meet the 3-month lookback will result in regression to N-CMR/N-BMC status as
         appropriate, or the pilot may be placed in probation status for 1 month at the SQ/CC's
         discretion. If probation is chosen, the only way to remove a pilot from probation and
         preserve the current status is to re-establish a 1-month lookback at the end of the
         probation period (see Figure 4.1.).
         4.7.1.2. CMR/BMC pilots regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC status for lookback, must
         complete a SQ/CC approved re-certification program to return the pilot to CMR/BMC
         standards. Upon completion of the re-certification program, the CMR/BMC pilots must
         also meet 1-month lookback requirement prior to reclaiming CMR/BMC status. The
         missions and events accomplished during the re-certification program may be credited
         towards their total/type sortie and event requirements for the training cycle as well as for
         their monthly sortie requirement.
         4.7.1.3. Lookback computations begin following completion of MQT. The pilot must
         maintain 1-month lookback until 3-month lookback is established. SQ/CCs may apply
         probation rules as described in paragraph 4.7.1.1. if a new CMR/BMC pilot fails to meet
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                37


       1-month lookback while establishing 3-month lookback. In addition, 1-month lookback
       will start the first full month of CMR/BMC status.
   4.7.2. Regression for Weapons Qualification. Failure to maintain RAP tasked weapons
   qualification at the end of the training cycle will require:
       4.7.2.1. For Events Tasked as Qual at CMR/BMC. Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC.
       To regain CMR/BMC, the pilot must re-achieve initial qualification in the deficient
       weapons event (see paragraph 5.2.). Events accomplished for this initial qualification
       may count toward the cumulative CT event qualification required at the end of the
       training cycle.
       4.7.2.2. For Events Tasked as Fam at CMR/BMC, Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC
       Status. To regain CMR/BMC, the pilot must accomplish at least three of the weapons
       deliveries under the supervision of a squadron supervisor or instructor. Events
       accomplished for this initial qualification may count toward the cumulative CT event
       qualification required at the end of the next training cycle.
   4.7.3. Pilots who fail an aircraft qualification, mission, or instrument evaluation will be
   handled IAW AFI 11-202V2, and AFI 11-2F-15V2. Pilots will regress to Non-CMR/Non-
   BMC status as applicable. These pilots will remain N-CMR/N-BMC status until successfully
   completing required corrective action, a re-evaluation, and are re-certified by the SQ/CC.
4.8. End of Cycle Requirements. Pilots who fail to complete mission and/or event
requirements of this volume by the end of the training cycle may require additional training
depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency. Refer to paragraph 4.9. to see if some of
these requirements can be prorated. In all cases, report training shortfalls IAW paragraph 1.12.
   4.8.1. Pilots that fail to meet the total annual RAP mission requirement may continue CT in
   CMR/ BMC status as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional
   training is required.
   4.8.2. Pilots that fail to meet requirements from the Training Cycle Event Requirements
   Table (RAP Tasking Memorandum) event requirements may continue CT in CMR/BMC
   status as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is
   required.
   4.8.3. Failure to meet RAP Mission Type Requirements will result in one of the following:
       4.8.3.1. Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC if the SQ/CC determines that the mission type
       deficiency is significant. To regain CMR/BMC status, the pilot will complete all deficient
       mission types. These missions may be counted against the total requirements for the new
       training cycle.
       4.8.3.2. Continuation at CMR/BMC if total RAP missions and lookback are maintained
       and the mission type deficiencies are deemed insignificant by the SQ/CC.
   4.8.4. Failure to accomplish missions required for Special Capabilities/Qualifications will
   result in loss of that qualification. The SQ/CC will determine re-qualification requirements.
4.9. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC
may prorate all training requirements when DNIFs, emergency leaves, COT leaves, non-flying
TDY/exercises (ANG: and or mandatory training required by civilian employment),
 38                                                      AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010


combat/contingency deployments, preclude training for a portion of the training period. Normal
annual leave will not be considered as non-availability. Extended bad weather, which precludes
the unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive days may be considered as non-availability.
(ANG: End-of-cycle proration is permitted for documented attrition (i.e. HHQ or weather
cancels, MNDs, ground or air aborts) in monthly increments when the total number of
occurrences ranges from one half to one times the individual’s normal monthly rate of flying).
The following guidelines apply:
   4.9.1. Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-
   availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
   4.9.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of training non-availability in the training cycle.
   Use Table 4.2. to determine the number of months to be prorated based on the cumulative
   calendar days of training non-availability.
   4.9.3. If IQT or MQT is re-accomplished, a pilot's training cycle will start over at a prorated
   share following completion of IQT/MQT training.

   4.9.4. Example: Capt Jenkins was granted 17 days of emergency leave in January and
   attended SOS in residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days. His
   SQ/CC authorized a total of two months proration from his training cycle (two months for
   the 73 cumulative days of non-availability for flying). (ANG: Maj Johnson is an experienced
   CMR pilot with a normal monthly requirement of 6 sorties. He had eight attrition
   occurrences throughout the training cycle, therefore his SQ/CC can prorate one month of Maj
   Johnson’s training requirements).
   4.9.5. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next
   lower whole number, but no requirement may be prorated below one.
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               39


   4.9.6. Newly assigned/converted pilots and pilots achieving CMR/BMC after the 15th of the
   month are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration
   purposes. Events and missions for the remainder of the training cycle may be prorated. A
   prorated share of RAP missions must be completed in CT.
   4.9.7. Night, Deployable Aerial Reflective Target (DART)/Aerial Gunnery Target System
   (AGTS)/BANNER (as applicable), and AAR requirements accomplished during MQT may
   be credited toward prorated CT requirements if accomplished during the cycle in which the
   pilot was declared CMR/BMC, unless specified otherwise by MAJCOM.
   4.9.8. A pilot's last month on station prior to departing PCS may be prorated provided 1
   month's proration is not exceeded. Individuals departing PCS may be considered CMR for
   reporting purposes during a period of 60 days from date of last flight, or until loss of CMR
   currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty station, whichever occurs first.
   4.9.9. CMR pilots who attend F-15 USAFWS in TDY-and-return status may be reported
   throughout the TDY as CMR. Upon return, those pilots will accomplish a prorated share of
   mission/event requirements (see Table 4.2.).
   4.9.10. Contingency Operations. Contingency operations can have a positive or negative
   impact on a unit's CT program, as emphasis is on supporting the actual contingency. A
   potential lack of training opportunities while supporting contingency operations can place a
   burden on the unit, forcing it to accomplish the majority of its CT program in a reduced
   period of time or with reduced assets. The following proration procedures are intended to
   provide flexibility in accomplishing the unit's CT program.
      4.9.10.1. Normally, all missions flown during contingency operations will be logged as
      contingency operations sorties. These sorties do not count toward total RAP
      requirements, but may be used for lookback purposes. Except AAR, CHAFF, FLARE,
      HAVE QUICK, AND SECURE VOICE, RAP events logged during contingency
      operations sorties do not count toward annual RAP requirements, but may be used to
      update currencies. Upon relief from contingency operations, units will prorate RAP
      missions and events for the period of time each individual was tasked. In addition,
      proration is authorized for the deployment preparation and deployment recovery time
      where home station flying is reduced by the MAJCOM.
          4.9.10.1.1. For ANG units, individuals deployed for more than a seven day period
          may prorate a one month portion of RAP sorties and events.
      4.9.10.2. As the training quality of missions flown at contingency locations may vary
      considerably, OG/CCs are authorized to allow sorties that provided valid training to be
      logged as RAP sorties. Events accomplished on these sorties count toward RAP event
      requirements, and these sorties/events may not be prorated.
          4.9.10.2.1. Upon release from contingency operations, proration is computed by
          calculating the sorties to be prorated for the entire deployment, and then subtracting
          the number of valid RAP sorties as authorized by the OG/CC. The result is the
          allowable sortie proration. Negative numbers equate to zero. Events will be prorated
          at SQ/CC discretion based on the events accomplished during valid RAP sorties.
4.10. Regaining CMR/BMC Status:
 40                                                    AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010


   4.10.1. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet the end of cycle weapons
   qualifications and/ or event requirements, re-qualification is IAW paragraph 4.7.
   4.10.2. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.7., the
   following applies (timing starts from the date the pilot came off CMR/BMC status):
      4.10.2.1. Up to 90 Days. The pilot must complete Sq/CC directed re-certification
      program in accordance with paragraph 4.7.1.2. In addition, all RAP event currencies must
      be regained. The Sq/CC will approve any other additional training prior to re-certification
      to CMR.
      4.10.2.2. 91-180 Days. Same as above, plus qualification and tactical written
      examinations.
      4.10.2.3. 181 Days and Beyond. Re-accomplish MQT; SQ/CC will determine if the
      MQT certification sortie requires a Form 8 checkride.
4.11. Example of the Lookback, Regression, Proration, and Re-Qualification Process:
   4.11.1. Maj Johnson is an experienced CMR pilot in ACC with a 1 and 3 month lookback
   requirement of 9 and 27 RAP sorties respectively. On Feb 3, he flew an ACBT sortie prior to
   departing for a non-flying TDY staff tour for two months. He reported back for flight duty on
   6 Apr. What is his status throughout his TDY and on his return?
      4.11.1.1. The SQ/CC wanted to list Maj Johnson as a countable CMR pilot for reporting
      purposes throughout the TDY. Therefore, on 1 Mar, his Flt/CC performed the mandatory
      1 month lookback (Feb) on Maj Johnson. He only flew 1 RAP sortie, failing the 1 month
      lookback. The Flt/CC then performed a 3 month lookback (Dec, Jan, Feb). This showed
      that he flew only 20 sorties for this period. Had he flown seven more sorties, his SQ/CC
      could continue Maj Johnson at CMR. However, with 20 sorties, Maj Johnson did not
      meet the 3 month lookback for a CMR pilot.
      4.11.1.2. The SQ/CC decided to carry Maj Johnson on 1-month probation. On 1 Apr,
      Maj Johnson's 1 month-lookback (Mar) was 0 sorties. The SQ/CC must now regress Maj
      Johnson to N-CMR. When Maj Johnson returns, the SQ/CC will have to place him in a
      re-certification program. Upon completing this program, Maj Johnson will need to re-
      establish his 1-month lookback by 1 May. Failing to do so would force him to be reported
      N-CMR for an additional month until the next lookback process on 1 June.
      4.11.1.3. If he had returned on 22 Mar, and had last landed the jet 48 days ago, he could
      fly a non-demanding sortie to regain demanding sortie and landing currency. For CMR
      purposes, Maj Johnson would need to fly 9 RAP sorties to recapture his 1-month
      lookback and get off probation. Although Maj Johnson was still CMR in Mar, the SQ/CC
      flew him with an IP on his first few sorties in order to regain his landing, AAR, LOWAT,
      and Formation T/O and Landing currencies.
      4.11.1.4. At the end of the training cycle on 30 Jun, the SQ/CC prorated 2 months off of
      Maj Johnson's total requirements. In spite of this proration, Maj Johnson was deficient in
      one RAP sortie category. The SQ/CC could regress Maj Johnson to Non-CMR, if deemed
      significant. After accomplishing the tailored re-certification program (the deficient
      sorties), the SQ/CC would re-certify Maj Johnson to CMR. This training counts for the
      new training cycle.
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                41


Figure 4.1. Regression Flow Chart.




4.12. Instruments. Develop an instrument training program to ensure instrument proficiency
including lost wingman training, briefings on how to recognize and deal with spatial
disorientation, HUD-off unusual attitude recoveries, and transition from visual to instrument
conditions. It will also stress the use of primary and standby cockpit flight instruments, rather
than the HUD, during instrument recovery from unusual attitudes or spatial disorientation and
proper integration of the HUD into the normal instrument cross-check.
   4.12.1. Units which seldom encounter bad weather and/or night recoveries should exercise
   pilot and approach facilities by periodically simulating "weather day" recovery operations, as
   determined by the SQ/CC.
   4.12.2. Pilots transferring from another theater require the theater-specific portions of IRC
   before flying. MQT that includes theater-specific portions of IRC academics and the MQT
   LAO mission may satisfy this requirement.
 42                                                     AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010


   4.12.3. Pilots may accomplish RAP events on an instrument mission provided
   accomplishment does not interfere with the primary goal of instrument training. Pilots should
   practice the transition from instruments to visual references on all instrument approaches.
   Instrument missions are RAP requirements and will be logged as such.
4.13. G-Awareness Continuation Training. Units will develop a CT program that provides
feedback to pilots and imprints a proper AGSM so that it becomes an integral part of pulling Gs.
   4.13.1. The basis of this program is to give each FL, SQ supervisor, aerospace physiologist
   and flight surgeon the skills needed to evaluate a flight member's AVTR to ensure a proper
   AGSM is being performed. This program also makes assessment of the AGSM a normal
   debrief item after every flight. The assessment should be done as a normal part of AVTR
   assessment while reviewing other tactical portions of the mission.
   4.13.2. Use the following minimum guidance to implement the unit's program:
       4.13.2.1. Incorporate AGSM technique and assessment into FLUG, IPUG, and squadron
       CT program. Place emphasis on briefing, debriefing, and assessing the AGSM using the
       AVTR in the debrief on a daily basis. FLs, IPs, SQ supervisors, Aerospace Physiologists
       and flight surgeons should become adept at assessing and teaching the correct AGSM.
       The video, "Anti-G Strain Technique Reinforcement and Assessment," or Anti-G strain
       technique academics will be presented annually by a qualified physiologists, flight
       surgeon, or IP squadron supervisor to all pilots as part of weapons academics. Academics
       will include a discussion of the limitations imposed on aircraft performance as a result of
       an ineffective AGSM.
       4.13.2.2. Units will include "AGSM effectiveness" on MQT and "AGSM assessment" on
       FLUG and IPUG grade sheets. Evaluate these areas during sorties where more than five
       Gs are pulled.
       4.13.2.3. Fly the tactical portion of all basic missions (BFM, ACM, etc.) in hot mic to
       enable assessment of the AGSM. Set intercom volumes at a level which is comfortable
       for the pilot but still allows assessment of breathing and AGSM technique in the debrief.
       For high task sorties (DACT, CFTR, etc.), it is highly desired for pilots to fly hot mic.
       The purpose of this is to identify breakdowns in the AGSM which commonly occur
       during high task portions of a mission.
       4.13.2.4. Film G-awareness exercises in HUD and in hot mic. The second turn of the G-
       awareness exercise for A/A sorties will be a minimum of 180 degrees of turn.
       4.13.2.5. FLs will emphasize G-awareness when appropriate during the flight briefing.
       4.13.2.6. FLs will assess the AGSM effectiveness of flight members during mission
       debriefings. This assessment should not be limited to the G-awareness exercise. Evaluate
       the AGSM after the pilot has had the time to fatigue, to get an accurate assessment of a
       pilot's AGSM during a tactically and G-demanding portion of flight. AGSM should also
       be evaluated under relatively low intensity G.
   4.13.3. FLs or SQ supervisors will identify pilots having poor AGSM technique or low G-
   tolerance to the Flt/CC or appropriate operations supervisor. The SQ/DO or appropriate
   operations supervisor will determine what action is required to improve the pilot's G-
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                  43


   tolerance. The SQ/CC will determine if refresher training is required IAW AFI 11-404,
   Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew.
   4.13.4. All SQ flight surgeons assigned to fighter/attack/FAC(A)/Recce/FTU are required to
   complete centrifuge training IAW AFI 11-404. During centrifuge training they will receive
   instruction on AVTR review.
   4.13.5. The squadron will develop a program to ensure an A/A mission tape for each pilot is
   reviewed each training cycle by an aerospace physiologist or squadron flight surgeon and
   documented. A squadron supervisor will review the documentation. If an aerospace
   physiologist or squadron flight surgeon are not available, a squadron supervisor will review
   the tape and document appropriately.
4.14. Low/Slow Speed Electronic Identification (EID)/Visual Identification (VID)
Procedures:
   4.14.1. For Strategic Defense Units and units specifically tasked to perform the strategic
   defense mission or counter drug role, comply with current approved guidance.
   4.14.2. For all other units, the objective of this low/slow EID/VID training is to expose pilots
   to problems associated with intercepting low/slow flying aircraft (rotary and fixed wing) for
   visual identification practice in a threat environment. Emphasis should be placed on
   dissimilar adversaries below 2000 feet AGL and 200 KIAS (helicopters are desired).
   Training will be conducted IAW AFTTP 3-1, AFI 11-2F-15V3, and AFI 11-214.
      4.14.2.1. Unit developed ground training programs will be designed for unit specific
      equipage and employment taskings. Academic sessions should be conducted during
      weapons and tactics training and maximum use of the visual recognition program is
      encouraged.
      4.14.2.2. Flying training missions should, to the maximum extent possible, include
      helicopter operations and considerations. Possible assets include USAF helicopters, USN
      helicopters, USA helicopters, and propeller aircraft. Creation of a realistic environment to
      stimulate the aircraft EID/VID suite is essential to the conduct of low/slow VID
      procedures. Units must make every effort to maximize effective use of limited assets as
      well as to instill awareness and actions appropriate to this training. SQ/CC's will
      determine the depth of ground and flying training necessary prior to participating in
      exercises and contingency operations.

                                           Chapter 5

                      WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT QUALIFICATION

5.1. General. This chapter outlines requirements for the initial qualification to employ weapons
(AIM-120, AIM-9 and GUN) and the requirements to maintain qualification in weapons
employment during Continuation Training. Refer to Attachment 2 for further guidance in
weapons events.
5.2. Initial Qualification:
   5.2.1. Initial missile employment qualification is evaluated on the mission qualification
   check ride and is achieved by meeting the "qualified" criteria for weapons employment IAW
   AFI 11-2F-15V2. Qualification in one missile category is assumed for other missile
   categories in such cases where only one type of missile was employed.
   5.2.2. Initial gun employment qualification is achieved by scoring an individual (i.e.,
   element/team hit is not applicable for initial qualification) hit during a live fire pass on a
   DART/AGTS/BANNER (as applicable) target. A hit is one bullet impact on the
   DART/AGTS/BANNER (as applicable). For initial qualification use any dart pattern as
   defined in AFI 11-214. If DART/AGTS/BANNER (as applicable) are not available, gun
   qualification may be accomplished via tape or DVR assessment. Strafing is a valid method of
   exercising the gun system, but does not qualify as A/A gunnery.
   5.2.3. The initial qualification satisfies weapons qualification requirements until the end of
   the current training period.
   5.2.4. Pilots must accomplish initial qualification in any weapons requiring qualification at
   CMR/ BMC except the gun.
5.3. CT Qualification:
   5.3.1. During CT each pilot's weapons employment will be assessed for validity IAW
   AFTTP 3-1 criteria and the results in each category (AIM-120, AIM-9, and GUN) will be
   recorded for the current training period for RAP required tasks. Qualification in weapons
   employment is maintained by achieving a 75 percent valid at pickle rate for AIM-120/9 shots
   and a 75 percent valid attempt at trigger squeeze rate for the gun. This qualification is valid
   throughout the next training period.
   5.3.2. To maintain DART/AGTS/BANNER (as applicable) qualification, pilots will use
   basic or tactical patterns as defined in AFI 11-214 and must achieve a hit.
5.4. Failure to Qualify:
   5.4.1. If qualification is required at CMR/BMC, failure to qualify will result in regression to
   N-CMR/ N-BMC and entered into re-certification until re-qualification is accomplished.
   5.4.2. DART/AGTS/BANNER (as applicable) re-qualification requires an individual hit
   IAW hit criteria in paragraph 5.3. above. Re-qualification may be accomplished using basic
   or tactical patterns. If DART/AGTS/BANNER (as applicable) are not available, gun re-
   qualification may be accomplished via VTR assessment.
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                             45


   5.4.3. SQ/CC will determine the corrective action required to re-qualify a pilot in those
   categories in which the pilot failed to meet standards.
5.5. Weapons Employment Parameters. The following employment parameters and
requirements form the basic frame work for pilot weapons employment training and all
deliveries will conform to limits established for each specific event.
   5.5.1. Missile employment parameters must be IAW AFTTP 3-1 criteria.
   5.5.2. Gun employment parameters must be IAW AFTTP 3-1 criteria.
       5.5.2.1. Gun pattern descriptions, procedures, training rules, and foul criteria are
       contained in AFI 11-2F-15V3 and AFI 11-214 as supplemented.
       5.5.2.2. Aircraft rounds limiter will be set as desired.
       5.5.2.3. Hit criteria: IAW AFTTP 3-1
          5.5.2.3.1. DART/AGTS/BANNER (as applicable). One bullet impact is required.
          5.5.2.3.2. During live-fire gun employment on an AGTS target with an inoperative
          scoring system a hit can be declared if VTR assessment shows that the firing
          parameters met AFTTP 3-1 hit criteria and the gun was fired. A hit may not be
          declared if the shot is non-assessable.
          5.5.2.3.3. During live-fire gun employment failure to qualify during hot passes will
          not be reversed by VTR assessed hit on cold passes.
5.6. Live Ordnance. Live ordnance training is essential to pilot combat capability. Every
attempt should be made to give each pilot the opportunity to employ as many types of weapons
inventoried on the unit's UCML as possible. To provide this opportunity, as a goal, all CMR
pilots should expend the following ordnance. (AFI 36-2217, Munitions Requirements for
Aircrew Training)
   5.6.1. For units tasked with DCA, Strategic Defense, and/or OCA-A missions: One live A/A
   missile employment per year.

                                 SPECIALIZED TRAINING

6.1. Specialized Training Programs. This chapter outlines upgrade training programs for
special capabilities and qualifications. These programs are intended to provide a basic starting
point and may be modified by the SQ/CC based on the unit's requirements and/or the upgradee's
previous experience, qualifications, and documented performance. Unless governed by a formal
syllabus, ground and device training for these programs will consist of unit-developed academics
and scenarios. Flight training will be conducted in accordance with a program approved by the
SQ/CC.
6.2. Simulator Instructor (SI). The following mission profiles should be used to train and
qualify selected simulator instructors to operate the IOS. The contractor simulator instructor
program will be IAW the appropriate contract. SQ/CCs will determine the number of SIs
required to perform the unit mission. The required supervision for this upgrade program is an
IOS qualified/current instructor.
   6.2.1. Academic Training. Prior to the first IOS mission, the upgrading simulator instructor
   (USI) will complete the following unit developed blocks of instruction:
       6.2.1.1. Principles of Instruction. Learning objectives, instructor responsibilities,
       instructor relationship, training facilities, and publications.
       6.2.1.2. Techniques of Fight Instruction. Training objectives and environment;
       maneuver demonstration, performance, and review; recognition and analysis of common
       errors.
       6.2.1.3. Conduct of Flight Briefing. Training objectives, order of presentation, use of
       briefing guides and audiovisual aids, debriefing techniques.
       6.2.1.4. Conduct of Phase Briefings. Techniques for briefing, use of visual aids, review
       of applicable briefings.
       6.2.1.5. Evaluations. Grading systems and preparation/use of gradesheets.
   6.2.2. Mission Profiles (Based on Simulator Capabilities):
       6.2.2.1. SI-1, IOS Operations. Mission initialization, CRT page review and
       modification, keyboard operation, light pen operation, emergency shutdown,
       record/playback, hard copy, performance, and procedures monitoring.
       6.2.2.2. SI-2, IOS Operations. Tactics mission file, console-operated air intercepts and
       options, A/A weapons scoring, ground threats and modifications, surface-to-air
       engagement scoring, program and simulator freeze, mission parameter modifications.
       6.2.2.3. SI-3, Practical Exercise. The USI will conduct a regularly scheduled simulator
       mission from the IOS under supervision of an IOS-qualified instructor.
   6.2.3. Following successful completion of SI-3, the SQ/CC will certify the pilot's SI status in
   appropriate written format (memorandum, ARMS, gradesheet, etc.).
6.3. Flight Lead Upgrade. SQ/CCs will select only highly qualified, motivated, and
responsible pilots for this program. Initial entry may be as a 2-ship/element FL until experience
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                47


and proficiency warrant further progression, in which case, responsibilities for employment will
not exceed 2 aircraft until certified as a 4-ship FL. The SQ/CC will determine when a 2-ship FL
may train toward larger, more complex formations (3 or 4-ship, mission commander, etc.). FL
training should place appropriate emphasis on 4-ship tactical employment.
   6.3.1. The following minimum flying hours are required prior to entering FL upgrade
   training:
       6.3.1.1. 250 hours PAI required (Up to 25 MTC hours may be applied to meeting this
       requirement), or
       6.3.1.2. 400 hours IP/MP/FP in an 11Fxx/11K3C/11K3D AFSC of which 150 hours are
       PAI, or
       6.3.1.3. 50 hours PAI, if previously qualified 11Fxx AFSC flight lead.
       6.3.1.4. (ANG) For converting units, SQ/CCs may select prior qualified pilots to
       upgrade to flight lead concurrently with the MQT top-off program regardless of PAA
       hours.
   6.3.2. Ground training will consist of locally developed instruction in the following areas:
       6.3.2.1. FL Responsibilities. FL/wingman relationship, unit training objectives.
       6.3.2.2. Mission Preparation. Mission objectives, wingman requirements and
       responsibilities, currencies, capabilities, delegation of mission planning duties, and
       briefing preparation.
       6.3.2.3. Conduct of Flight Briefings and Debriefings. Objectives, use of briefing
       guides and audiovisual aids, flight member involvement, briefing techniques,
       debriefing/questioning techniques, tape review responsibilities and procedures.
       6.3.2.4. Conduct of Missions. Control of flight, flight discipline, emergency
       procedures, training rules, and responsibilities to SQ/CC.
       6.3.2.5. AGSM Techniques. Briefing, debriefing, and AVTR/DVR assessment. Review
       the video, Anti-G Strain Technique Reinforcement and Assessment.
       6.3.2.6. IFEs and Emergency Diverts.
       6.3.2.7. FLUG SIMs. Tactical intercepts, OCA, and DCA SIMS.
   6.3.3. Flight training will be conducted in accordance with a program approved by the
   SQ/CC. The following is a recommended baseline program which may be modified as
   necessary to meet unit and/or upgradee specific needs. Missions may be flown in any order
   provided day training precedes respective night training. SQ/CCs will determine which
   sorties are required based on a review of previous experience and may certify a flight lead
   with appropriate restrictions based on training not accomplished (i.e. AAR, etc.). An
   evaluation sortie is required. Two formation takeoffs and landings, a day and night aerial
   refueling, and a trail recovery will be accomplished as a flight lead during the program. Tape
   review/assessment, to include a review of AGSM, will be accomplished on every sortie. All
   FLUG training will be under the supervision of an IP or flight lead-qualified squadron super-
   visor. Dissimilar adversaries should be used to the maximum extent practical during FLUG
48                                                   AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010


  training. FLUG-8 through 10 are only required for 4-ship FL upgrade. (NOTE: If 2- and 4-
  ship upgrade training are combined, only one evaluation sortie is required.)
     6.3.3.1. FLUG-1--BFM. Mission Objectives: Practice leading and controlling 1v1
     BFM mission. Specific Mission Tasks: Briefing (emphasis on pursuit curves, AHC,
     weapons employment zones, high AOA maneuvering, departure/loss of control
     prevention/recovery, and GLOC awareness); formation takeoff (lead); weapons system
     checks; tactical formation; offensive and defensive BFM from visual perch setups;
     weapons employment; BD check; recovery, single ship landing, mission reconstruction/
     debriefing; tape review/ assessment (to include AGSM).
     6.3.3.2. FLUG-2--ACM. Mission Objectives: Practice leading and controlling a 2 v 1
     ACM mission. Specific Mission Tasks: Briefing (emphasis on engaged/support fighter
     responsibilities, attack options, radio procedures, radar/visual lookout techniques,

       6.5.3.3. Accomplish applicable SIM requirements established at unit level prior to
       flights.
   6.5.4. Flying Training. As a minimum, the upgrading MCC will observe a certified MCC
   during the planning, briefing, flight, and debriefing of at least one composite force mission.
   Prior to certification, the upgrading MCC will then plan, brief, fly, and debrief a minimum of
   one mission under the supervision of an IP or Squadron Supervisor who is MCC qualified.
   This program establishes the minimum guidelines for upgrade to MCC.
       6.5.4.1. To qualify as a MCC sortie, the pilot must be acting as the Mission Commander
       for a joint/composite mission responsible for two or more types of aircraft with four or
       more total aircraft or more than four own MDS aircraft versus a minimum of four pre-
       planned aircraft. Unit tasking should drive force composition.
       6.5.4.2. The MCC will determine overall upgrade mission effectiveness in case of
       fallout.
   6.5.5. Certification. Following satisfactory completion of the above requirements, the
   SQ/CC will certify a new MCC by placing a letter of certification in the training folder and
   indicating qualifications on letter of Xs.
6.6. DART/AGTS/BANNER (as applicable) Tow.
   6.6.1. Ground Training. Prior to the first DART/AGTS/BANNER (as applicable) tow
   mission, the upgrading tow pilot will be thoroughly familiar with preflight, takeoff, enroute,
   deployment, employment, flight restrictions, emergency procedures, towing
   procedures/techniques, and training rules.
   6.6.2. Flying Training. Tow pilots will be certified by the squadron commander and
   accomplish a minimum of one upgrade sortie which will include one basic dart pattern and
   one tactical pattern (if applicable). The upgrading pilot will accomplish the upgrade sortie in
   the FCP of a B/D model under the supervision of a tow-qualified (for the pattern being
   flown) pilot in the RCP.

           This instructor may certify additional instructors within the Squadron and Operations
           Group.
           6.8.1.1.2. Units will designate highly experienced NVG IPs to conduct local
           academic training, and will use MAJCOM approved courseware. For local
           academics, NVG instructional videos will be used to demonstrate NVG visual
           illusions in place of the terrain board.
           6.8.1.1.3. Academics will be accomplished within 60 days prior to accomplishing
           NVG-1. If more than 60 days elapse prior to NVG-1, pilots must review the NVG
           academics. If more than 180 days elapse between completion of NVG academics and
           NVG-1, pilots must re-accomplish NVG academics.

       debrief an NVG 1-3 type sortie to an IP level. Complete tasks for NVG 1-3 sorties, as
       appropriate.
6.9. Contingency/Exercise Spin-up Training. This training will be conducted prior to support
of contingency operations (if time permits) or exercises. The objective of this training is to
ensure the pilot's ability to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking. For contingency
operations, units are responsible for contacting appropriate gaining command/operations to
determine expected mission taskings. For exercises, units are responsible for referring to
appropriate EXPLANS and contacting appropriate exercise POCs prior to deployment to
determine expected mission taskings. These EXPLANS include COMACC EXPLANS 80 for
Red, Maple, and Coalition Flags, EXPLAN 323 for Green Flag West, and EXPLAN 163 for
Green Flag East. This assures the units are prepared for the appropriate tasking and allows the
responding OG/CC to tailor this training for the theater, threat, and tactics for the assigned task.
The SQ/CC is then responsible for implementation of this spin-up, prosecuting the required
missions, and determining the specific requirements necessary to reach the desired level of
proficiency. Emphasis will be placed on training needed for missions not accomplished in daily
operations. This training will be conducted IAW all applicable instructions.
   6.9.1. If a pilot is not assigned to the tasked squadron, they must receive spin-up training as
   determined by the tasked SQ/CC. This applies to all attached pilots (OG/WG/HQ staffs, etc.),
   and all pilots augmenting from other squadrons (operational, FTU, weapons school, test,
   etc.). The objective of this training is to ensure attached/augmenting pilot is proficient to
   conduct all missions in support of expected tasking. The deploying SQ/CC will determine the
   amount of spin-up training required for each attached/augmenting pilot based on the pilot's
   level of proficiency, currency, qualification, experience, etc. For augmenting pilots, once the
   amount of spin-up training is determined, the augmentee's SQ/CC is responsible for ensuring
   the spin-up training is accomplished.
   6.9.2. Ground Training. All applicable pilots will complete ground training as necessary
   prior to their support of contingency operations or exercises.
       6.9.2.1. Academics. Units will brief exercise SPINS, ROE/Training Rules, command
       and control, engagement authority and procedures, and visual identification.
       MAJCOM/IN will assist the unit's intelligence functions in the development of threat
       assessments and visual recognition training materials.
       6.9.2.2. Visual Recognition. Pilots must be able to visually identify aircraft (rotary and
       fixed wing, including joint/allied assets) they are likely to encounter by name or
       numerical designator and determine whether the aircraft is a threat or non-threat (training
       should incorporate all aspects/angles, theater specific paint schemes/fin flashes, and
       various configurations), identify ground equipment, and determine major categories of
       naval vessels.

   6.9.3. Flying Training. Tailor spin-up training to ensure all supporting pilots are proficient,
   current, and qualified in all expected mission taskings.
6.10. Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) Qualification Training. The purpose
of this program is to train IPs, flight leads, and wingmen in JHMCS high off-boresight system
(HOBS) operation and employment. The qualification program outlined below is the minimum
training required to qualify inexperienced pilots in JHMCS employment. Squadron Commanders
may tailor this program for experienced pilots
   6.10.1. Ground Training. Pilots upgrading to JHMCS must complete the following
   requirements prior to their first sortie:
       6.10.1.1. JHMCS Academics
          6.10.1.1.1. Initial academics will be accomplished locally or during simulator
          orientation (if available).
          6.10.1.1.2. Academic courseware will be approved by MAJCOM.
          6.10.1.1.3. Academics will be accomplished within 60 days prior to the first JHMCS
          qualification sortie. If more than 60 days elapse between academics and the first
          sortie, pilots will reaccomplish academics.
       6.10.1.2. JHMCS Simulator Orientation Training
          6.10.1.2.1. Although        AIM-9X       capability    is   incorporated    into     unit
          ViWS/FMTs/WTTs with the current OFP, JHMCS-modified SIMs may not be
          available for initial orientation training. If a SIM with JHMCS is available, pilots will
          complete JHMCS SIM-1 prior to flight. Cockpit orientation and JHMCS preflight in
          an aircraft with external power is an acceptable substitution for JHMCS SIM-1 when
          MTC is not JHMCS capable.
          6.10.1.2.2. JHMCS SIM-1 Mission Objectives. Introduce JHMCS preflight,
          ground operations, radar/missile cueing and employment, JHMCS degraded and
          failure modes, system limitations, emergency egress, ejection, and human factors
          implications (display fixation, fatigue, etc.). Specific Tasks: JHMCS preflight, strap-
          in, boresight, switchology/HOTAS functions, ground operations, JHMCS and AIM-
          9X Built-in Test (BIT) and indications, FENCE check, weapons/radar/navigation
          display orientation, helmet mounted display (HMD) auto acquisition modes, radar
          and missile (AIM-9M/X) cueing and employment, AIM-9X Fighter Data Link
          cueing, "uplook" cueing orientation, declutter modes, and after landing checks.
          Special subjects to be emphasized during all JHMCS training include the potential for
          display fixation and ejection risks.
   6.10.2. General Instructions
       6.10.2.1. Entry into JHMCS qualification training requires SQ/CC approval. Squadron
       commanders should allow pilots to accomplish JHMCS training concurrent with MQT.
       6.10.2.2. Except for JHMCS-2, qualification training will be flown in order.
       6.10.2.3. JHMCS-2 may be flown at any time after JHMCS-1 and is not required prior to
       JHMCS-3 certification. However, pilots may employ JHMCS IAW their LOWAT
       category only after completing JHMCS-2 (limited to 1000 AGL until accomplished).

Terms
Air Combat Training (ACBT)—A general term which includes (D)BFM, (D)ACM, and
(D)ACT. The prefix (D) refers to dissimilar assets. When present, dissimilar is optional. When
the prefix is missing, similar is assumed as flown/required. When present without parenthesis,
dissimilar is assumed flown or required. This convention corresponds to all facets of ACBT (i.e.,
BFM, ACM, ACT).
 70                                                     AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010


Air Combat Tactics (ACT)—Training in the application of BFM, ACM, and tactical intercept
skills to achieve a tactical air-to-air objective. (AFI 11-214)
Air Sovereignty Alert (ASA) Training—Training to maintain proficiency in day/night
intercepts on slow/ low-flying aircraft and traditional intercepts, with emphasis on target
identification and shadowing procedures.
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—The status of an aircrew who has satisfactorily completed
training (MQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational missions but
does not maintain CMR status. Aircrew accomplishes training required to remain familiarized in
all, and may be qualified and proficient in some, of the core missions of their weapon system and
unit. These aircrew members may also maintain special capabilities. (Refer to paragraph 4.3.)
Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ)—A status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed training prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to fly the unit aircraft. The
member must perform at the minimum frequency necessary to meet the most recent sortie and
flight standards set for the weapons system. BAQ will only be carried by aircrew until
completion of MQT. BAQ is not a permanent qualification except for General Officers above the
wing level, and any other crew members specifically authorized by MAJCOM A3. Aircrews are
not authorized to perform RAP-tasked combat event/sorties without instructor aircrew or SQ
supervisor supervision. Flight duties will be limited to those identified in paragraph 4.3.
Certification—The process of certifying aircrew tactical employment and special weapons
capabilities, procedures, and rules. Replaces verification for nuclear tasked units.
Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT)—A training device in which the controls, switches,
and instruments do not have to respond to trainee inputs. Used for checklist use, normal
procedures, and emergency procedures, AFI 36-2251, Management of Air Force Training
Systems).
Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT)—A training device in which instruments and displays are
activated to respond to trainee inputs. Used for safety of flight, instrument, normal, and
emergency procedures (see AFP 50-11, AFI 36-2251).
Combat Edge (CE)—A positive-pressure breathing-for-G (PPG) system which provides pilots
additional protection against high positive G accelerations experienced during flight. The system
consists of aircrew equipment (high-pressure mask, counter-pressure suit, G-suit), and aircraft
equipment (oxygen regulator, G-valve, and interfacing sense line). At 5-G and above, regulated
air and oxygen are supplied to the system to provide automatic mask tensioning, vest inflation,
and positive pressure breathing to the mask.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—A status of a pilot who has satisfactorily completed training
(MQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational missions, and
maintains qualification and proficiency in these missions. All active duty API -1/2's, Squadron
Commander, Operations Officers, and OG/CC designated API -6 manning positions are required
to maintain this qualification level. EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, they may elect to
train the front line of their UMD to CMR with the overage designated as BMC. Approximately
50% of the pilots selected for CMR must be inexperienced. (Refer to paragraph 4.3.)
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                  71


Composite Force Training (CFTR)—Scenarios employing multiple flights of the same or
different types of aircraft, each under the direction of its own flight leader, performing the same
or different roles. (AFI 11-214)
Continuation Training (CT)—Training to maintain proficiency and improve aircrew
capabilities to perform unit missions and aircrew proficiency sorties not flown in formal syllabus
missions, tests, or evaluations. Applicable to CMR and BMC aircrew.
Currency—The minimum frequency required to perform an event or sortie safely.
Delivery Parameters—Data reflecting current delivery considerations for general purpose
ordnance as well as tactical survivability. Appropriate aircraft/ weapons Tech Orders must be
consulted for live ordnance safe escape criteria and dash one performance charts for recovery
altitudes.
Electronic Protection (EP) Intercept—An intercept performed against a target using active
and/or passive EA against attacker's radar, causing the attacker to employ EP techniques or
tactics. Does not include co-channel interference.
Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE)—An evaluation of aircrew knowledge and
responsiveness to critical and non-critical EPs conducted by a FE in a CPT, CFT, UTD, or
aircraft cockpit.
Experienced Pilot (EXP)—Pilots require one of the following to be considered experienced:

1,000 hrs (FP/IP/MP/EP), of which 300 are PAI, or
600 fighter hrs, of which 200 hrs are PAI, or
previously fighter EXPERIENCED and 100 hrs PAI .
Hours are defined as FP/IP/MP/EP time and fighter time is defined as hours logged in
aircraft with an assigned AFSC of 11FX or sister service equivalent (e.g. Navy F—18 pilot).

            GLOSSARY OF MISSION/SORTIE AND EVENT DEFINITIONS

A2.1. Mission/Sortie Definitions.
   A2.1.1. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC). Basic skills sortie. Training for
   proficiency in utilization and exploitation of the aircraft flight envelope, consistent with
   operational and safety constraints, including, but not limited to high/maximum AOA
   maneuvering, energy management, minimum time turns, maximum/optimum acceleration
   and deceleration techniques, and confidence maneuvers.
   A2.1.2. Attrition Sortie. Programming tool used to forecast future flight hour and sortie
   requirements. Attrition sorties are derived from historical data and used to account for sorties
   cancelled before flight. Launched sorties cannot be considered attrition (see Non-effective
   Sortie definition).
   A2.1.3. Basic Fighter Maneuvers/Air Combat Maneuvers (BFM/ACM). Building block
   sorties. BFM (1 v 1) Training designed to apply aircraft handling skills to gain proficiency in
   recognizing and solving range, closure, aspect, angle off, and turning room problems in
   relation to another aircraft to either attain a position from which weapons may be launched,
   or defeat weapons employed by an adversary. ACM (2 v 1 or 2 v 1+1) Training designed to
   achieve proficiency in element formation maneuvering and the coordinated application of
   BFM to achieve a simulated kill or effectively defend against one or more aircraft from a pre-
   planned starting position.
   A2.1.4. Collateral Sorties. Sorties not directly related to combat employment or basic skills
   training but necessary for accomplishment of unit missions. These include ferry flights,
   deployments, FCF flights, incentive flights, orientation flights, airshows, etc. These sorties
   are not required for RAP training purposes.
   A2.1.5. Commander Option Sortie/Mission. A sortie that may be used to provide
   individualized training based on proficiency and demonstrated performance. This sortie may
   be allocated above the guidelines in the RAP Tasking Memo for all mission types (Except
   CMR Red Air). The intent is to use these missions as necessary throughout the training cycle,
   rather than allocating them at the beginning of the training cycle.
   A2.1.6. Contingency Sortie. A mission tasked and flown while deployed for a contingency
   operation in which training is limited. These sorties are logged as Contingency Operations
   Sortie (SC13) in ARMS. These sorties and events accomplished on the sorties do not count
   towards annual RAP requirements however, the sorties may be used for lookback and the
   events to update currencies.
   A2.1.7. Defensive Counter Air (DCA). Mission sortie designed to develop proficiency in
   DCA mission tactics. Mission elements include: Intel scenario and mission planning,
   execution of tactics to detect, engage, and negate aircraft employing adversary tactics and
   weapons capabilities to penetrate protected airspace or attack a specific target area, and in-
   flight report.
   A2.1.8. Demanding Mission. Sorties that task the pilot to the extent that flying frequency
   and continuity are most critical. Authorized sorties/events requiring demanding mission
AFI11-2F-15V1 7 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                  75


  currency are: (D)ACM, (D)ACT, LOWAT (below 1,000 feet AGL), SQ/CCs may add
  sorties/events to the demanding sortie list, depending on unit tasking and the individual's
  capabilities. Also see Non-demanding Sortie.
  A2.1.9. 4-Ship Flight Lead (4FL ) Mission/Sortie. Special qualification sortie. Sortie where
  FL leads a flight of 4 or more. May be logged in conjunction with baseline training
  requirements. Aircraft attrition to 3 ship employment may count.
  A2.1.10. Force Protection. Mission sortie designed to develop proficiency in force
  protection tactics. Mission elements include: Intel scenario and integrated mission planning
  to support force package objectives, execution of tactics to detect and negate threats
  employing adversary tactics and weapons capabilities to disrupt force package
  employment/destroy package assets, and in-flight report.
  A2.1.11. HVAA Protection. Mission sortie designed to develop proficiency in protecting a
  high value airborne asset. Mission elements include: Intel scenario and integrated mission
  planning to HVAA objectives, execution of tactics to detect and negate threats employing
  adversary tactics and weapons capabilities to disrupt/destroy employment or the asset, and
  in-flight report.
  A2.1.12. Instructor Pilot (IP) Mission/Sortie. Special qualification sortie. Sortie where IP
  acted in the capacity of an instructor. IPs/supervisors will log an IP sortie when acting in that
  capacity on a building block MQT sortie (BFM, ACM, BSA), IPUG missions, when
  occupying the rear cockpit when the rear cockpit is not the primary duty location, or on any
  sortie where IP duties preclude effective combat mission training. On other sorties, IPs may
  log a rap mission sortie if quality training was obtained for the instructor. May be logged by
  evaluators on check rides if the above conditions apply. Will not be dual-logged with other
  RAP sorties.
  A2.1.13. Instrument Mission/Sortie. Basic skills sortie. Training designed to ensure
  instrument proficiency. RAP events may be accomplished on an instrument sortie provided
  accomplishment does not interfere with the primary goal of instrument training. Units are
  allocated sorties for every pilot to accomplish their requirements.
  A2.1.14. Mission Commander (MCC) Mission/Sortie. Special qualification sortie. Sortie
  where pilot acted in the capacity of a MCC for a joint/composite mission responsible for two
  or more types of aircraft with four or more total aircraft, or more than four own MDS aircraft
  versus a minimum of two pre-planned adversary aircraft. May be logged in conjunction with
  baseline training requirements.
  A2.1.15. Night Mission. Sortie on which either takeoff or landing and at least 50 percent of
  flight duration or 1 hour, whichever is less, occur between the end of evening civil twilight
  and the beginning of morning civil twilight, as published in the American Air Almanac.
  A2.1.16. Non-demanding Mission. A day sortie that provides the pilot with the opportunity
  to regain basic flying proficiency without excessively tasking those skills that have been
  under-used during the non-flying period. Authorized sorties/events flown for/on a non-
  demanding sortie are: instruments, AHC, BFM, Red-Air TI/ACT bandit, low level
  navigation at or above 500 feet AGL, basic weapons delivery, and basic intercepts. SQ/CCs
  may delete sorties/events from this non-demanding sortie list, depending on unit tasking and
  the individual's capabilities.

      paragraph 4.6.7.
   A2.1.17. Non-Effective Sortie. A sortie planned and launched as a training mission, test
   mission, Basic Skills sortie, or collateral sortie that, due to some circumstance (weather, IFE,
   maintenance, etc.), fails to accomplish a sufficient number of planned events.
   A2.1.18. RAP SIM. SIM mission that meets requirements dictated in the RTM that is
   counted toward RAP lookback and experience pilot requirements.
   A2.1.19. Red Air Mission/Sortie. A/A sortie where tactics, aircraft simulation, weapon
   systems, and/or maneuvering is limited to the extent that complete own MDS training is not
   accomplished. Restrictions which limit aircraft capabilities to some level which might be
   encountered in combat do not require logging the sortie as Red Air. Red Air sortie allocations
   in the tasking memo are a maximum cap on degraded training. Unused Red Air allocations
   should be flown in one of the other A/A training mission categories.
   A2.1.20. Sweep. Mission sortie designed to develop proficiency in OCA-A sweep tactics.
   Mission elements include: Intel scenario and tactical mission planning, execution of tactics
   designed to detect, engage, and negate simulated adversary aircraft which are operating
   within specific commit criteria (i.e. range, airspace corridor, vul time, etc), and in-flight
   report.
A2.2. Event Definitions:
   A2.2.1. Unless otherwise specified in these event descriptions, units will determine the
   necessary parameters for fulfilling and/or logging tasked events. Event is defined in one of
