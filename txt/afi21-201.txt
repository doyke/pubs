SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. This
revision complies with AFI 33-360 waiver tier requirements and changes the publication title
from "Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management" to "Conventional Munitions
Management" to reflect the scope that includes munitions supply chain management, inventory
and management, and maintenance management. This revision updates numerous conventional
munitions management procedures to reflect changes to Department of Defense (DoD) policies,
Chief Financial Officer (CFO) guidance, Information Technology (IT) capabilities, and
Management Information Systems (MIS). This revision updates inventory processes and
controls to satisfy CFO Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirements. This
revision also updates munitions processes, and reflects changes to accountability and
management requirements for munitions and missile systems. Finally, this revision makes
appropriate administrative changes.

                         MUNITIONS PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

3.1. Conventional Munitions Serviceability and Product Assurance. Assurance of munitions
reliability is essential to effective air and ground operations in support of training and combat
operations. The key elements of munitions reliability are Aging and Surveillance (A&S) testing,
periodic surveillance inspections, specific event inspection/testing (e.g., pre- or post-use, receipt,
shipping, and special). These processes ensure fielded munitions systems perform according to
design specification at the intended point-of-use. Suspect assets are segregated prior to use,
issue, or delivery.
   3.1.1. General Product Assurance Duties and Responsibilities. All munitions activities,
   flights, and munitions-using organizations execute the following key Product Assurance
   duties and responsibilities: (T-0).

     Maintenance Worksheet, and maintain completed DA Form 2404 IAW DoD 4500.9-R.
     (T-0).
     3.4.3.3. Upload DA Form 2404 and most current Inspection Checklist for each ISO into
     ACAMS IAW DOD 4500.9-R, Part VI and AFI 24-203. (T-0).
     3.4.3.4. The DAC conducts the in-resident CSC certification course. CSC distance
     learning course (Ammo-43-DL) is also available on the DAC website and is authorized
     for CSC initial and refresher training/certification for Air Force personnel.
  3.4.4. Budgeting for MILVAN Costs.
     3.4.4.1. When USAF owned MILVAN containers are used for local storage of munitions
     assets, munitions components, or munitions equipment, maintenance and repair of AF
     owned ISO containers are a PEC 28030 expense. (T-1). In this case, units shall budget
     annually for container maintenance and inspection costs. (T-1).
     3.4.4.2. Costs to train and qualify munitions personnel to maintain, inspect, and certify
     MILVANS (organic/contract) periodically or prior to munitions loading are a PEC 28030
     expense. (T-1).

3.6. Munitions Security.
   3.6.1. Risk Categories. Risk Categories and munitions storage and facility security criteria
   are IAW DoD 5100.76-M, AFI 31-101, and Lead Command supplemental guidance to AFI
   31-101.
   3.6.2. Release of Munitions Information to the Public or Foreign Entities.
      3.6.2.1. Public release of Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) munitions information
      requires approval of the installation, MAJCOM, or HAF Public Affairs (SAF/PA) office.
      (T-0). Technical data content requires additional T.O. content manager approval. (T-0).
      Requesters will submit information/data to be released to include proposed oral
      conversations and/or statements, speeches, articles, photographs, brochures,
      advertisements, displays, presentations, etc. (T-0). Contractors, manufacturers, and other
      non-government agencies must screen and certify in writing to the releasing approval
      authority that SBU munitions information submitted for release approval is unclassified,
      technically accurate, and suitable for open publication.
      3.6.2.2. Any government or commercial agent receiving a request for release of
      classified or unclassified conventional munitions information to a foreign government or
      individual must obtain approval IAW AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific And
      Technical Information. (T-1).
   3.6.3. Determining Classification of Munitions Information. Executive Order (E.O.)
   12958 mandates that the Original Classification Authority (OCA) determines whether
   damage to national security would result and the level of damage that would reasonably be
   expected to be cause from unauthorized disclosure of information. The OCA must be able to
   identify and describe the damage. Munitions Information Classification Rules listed in
   Table 3.1, Munitions Information Classification Rules do not address all possible
   combinations of information, but serve as a guide. Table 3.2, General Classification Rules
   outlines general classification designations for munitions information.
      3.6.3.1. Security classification guides are developed IAW DoDM 5200.01, DoD
      Information Security Program: Overview, Classification, and Declassification, Vol. 1,
      Enclosure 6. PM will coordinate weapons-specific security classification guides
      affecting munitions or missile systems or their end-items with AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-C
      prior to publication or update. Weapon-specific security classification guides are posted
30                                                               AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


     on the GACP website. PM is responsible to keep security classification guides current
     and posted on the GACP website. Weapon-specific security classification guides take
     precedence over security classification guidance in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2.
     3.6.3.2. Three primary terms are used in munitions classification determination. Proper
     use of these terms will avoid unnecessary classification:
        3.6.3.2.1. Requirements: The Non-nuclear Consumables Annual Analysis (NCAA)
        and Tactical Air Missile Program (TAMP) documents calculate requirements for
        munitions to support unified commander missions under the methodology in DoDI
        3000.04, DoD Munitions Requirements Process (MRP). The WCDO indicates the by
        base distribution of the NCAA and TAMP Combined Theater Requirement (CTR)
        data. Requirements are normally classified by the OCA using the logic rules outlined
        in the Table 3.1 and 3.2.
        3.6.3.2.2. Allocations: The approved quantity of munitions items allocated to a
        command or theater based on a fair share of the stockpile. Allocations and associated
        requisitions are normally unclassified.
        3.6.3.2.3. Quantity: The on-hand amount of munitions available at any given time.
        Refer to the specific weapons classification guide for classification of quantity
        information. When items in the paragraphs below are not discussed or included, on-
        hand quantities are normally unclassified. On-hand quantities used in association
        with any of the items below shall be classified as SECRET or above.
            3.6.3.2.3.1. References to a specific plan, OPLAN, or Concept Plan
            (CONPLAN).
            3.6.3.2.3.2. Assessments of NCAA and TAMP requirements against on-hand
            quantities, base, command, or theater resulting in a capability assessment
            (percentage, proportion, ratio, color-code, etc.).
            3.6.3.2.3.3. Identity or designation of the units that the wartime/contingency
            stocks are intended to support.
            3.6.3.2.3.4. C-Day for establishment of re-supply.
            3.6.3.2.3.5. Theater start-time periods.

3.7. Key and Lock Control Procedures for Conventional Munitions Facilities. See AFI 21-
200.
3.8. Munitions Training Programs.
   3.8.1. General Training Requirements. Training focuses on management of assigned
   programs, munitions processes, and qualification of technicians and supervisors to execute
   effective control, accountability, storage, receipt, shipment, inspection, maintenance,
   assembly, flightline delivery, and limited disposition of conventional, precision guided,
   NWRM, and associated components.
        3.8.1.1. Munitions training programs will emphasize CAS operations, processing
        procedures, operation of Automated Identification Technology (AIT) equipment, and
        TMRS (if applicable) throughout the range of munitions operations. (T-2).
        3.8.1.2. Maximize the use of the Air Force Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide
        located on the AF Conventional Munitions SharePoint site (see Training Tools / Guides
        tab) when developing local training programs. (T-2).
   3.8.2. Munitions Qualification Training. Training to achieve proficiency, experience, and
   skill in mandatory, wartime, core, and supervisor assigned tasks; and to enable skill level
34                                                                 AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


  upgrade IAW the 2W0X1 Munitions Systems CFETP. The focus of qualification training is
  on technical tasks such as checkout, operation, organizational level use and maintenance of
  assigned munitions, tools, test, handling equipment, vehicles, and facilities. Qualification
  training may also include specific home station training, deployment/UTC task requirements,
  and other AF unique specialized certification requirements.
  3.8.3. CMT Program. The CMT program is designed to provide hands-on familiarization
  training to develop core knowledge for all 2W0XX and company grade officers assigned to
  the MUNS/Munitions Flight. CMT is not intended to fully qualify personnel in all tasks.
  The unit's conventional munitions mission or OPLAN tasking (in-place or deployed) has
  primary emphasis in the CMT program and includes all facets of the munitions support
  mission, accountability, and CAS processes. CMT training will utilize standard CAS screens
  and CAS help screens to promote proficiency in CAS transaction processing. CMT
  programs should attempt to develop cross-functionality in the use of personnel to the
  maximum extent possible. CMT participation by Munitions Supervision (e.g., Capt, Lt,
  CMSgt, and SMSgt) should focus on leadership, mentorship, hands-on review, and
  adaptation of the CMT curriculum at the point of instruction. Munitions Supervision is
  responsible for establishing and implementing an effective CMT program and directs the
  Training Section/element NCOIC in all stages of program development. (T-2). Munitions
  Supervision, supported by the Training Section and other workcenters shall:
     3.8.3.1. Develop a task-training list used to manage training for all contingency tasks and
     operations. (T-2). The task-training list will identify the task to be instructed and the
     frequency (18 month maximum). Because supporting tasks are equally critical, the
     MUNS Superintendent/Flight Chief may designate personnel that only require CMT
     training on supporting tasks as identified on the task-training list.
     3.8.3.2. Determine the number of personnel (total number or percentage of assigned)
     required to train on each contingency task to meet the unit's most demanding contingency
     requirements. (T-2). When developing the task training list, number of personnel to train,
     and frequency of training consider the following:
         3.8.3.2.1. The usage and type tasked munitions from the UCML, weapons task
         qualification listing, ITO, aircrew training syllabus, and OPLANs.
         3.8.3.2.2. Collateral mission tasking, MEP, and base support plans.
         3.8.3.2.3. The criticality of supporting tasks.
         3.8.3.2.4. The complexity, frequency, and duration of tasks performed.
         3.8.3.2.5. The need for flexibility in the use of personnel during contingency
         operations.
         3.8.3.2.6. The scheduling and the availability of personnel.
     3.8.3.3. Develop and coordinate CMT training outlines with Wing Safety and QA (or
     equivalent) for ground/weapons safety adequacy and technical accuracy; the MASO to
     promote standardization of CAS tasks and processes; and with the local
     logistics/maintenance training flight to ensure the course curriculum and training outlines
     meet requirements of AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional Systems Development. (T-2).
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                    35


     3.8.3.4. Ensure all 2W0XX personnel assigned outside the Munitions Squadron/Flight
     attend CMT at intervals designated by the MUNS Superintendent/Flight Chief. (T-3).
     This ensures munitions personnel retain familiarization on core munitions tasks and meet

       Illustrated Parts Breakdown - Acceleration Monitor Assembly (AMA).
3.11. Untagged Plastic Explosive (PE). Commanders (or equivalent) of units that use, possess,
or store munitions and explosives ensure that personnel in the performance of their duties,
comply with the provisions of Public Law 104-132, The Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act of 1996. Refer to paragraph 1.4.23. (T-0).
   3.11.1. Air Force personnel shall not accept, possess, or provide storage for untagged PE
   assets, unless specifically excepted/exempted by the Act or written provision. (T-0). This
   applies to routine, emergency, temporary, or long term conditions and includes requests from
   other military service organizations and federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies. If
   the tagging status or condition of a PE asset is unknown and/or cannot be verified, the item
   shall be considered untagged.
   3.11.2. Before storing any untagged PE, Commanders shall obtain advice from the local
   Judge Advocate (JA). (T-0). USAF personnel are not exempt from the provisions of this Act
   and JA or USAF units may disapprove requests to store exempted/excepted untagged PE if
   such storage imposes undue legal, safety, security, operational, or environmental constraints.
   3.11.3. Any proposed exception from the Act must be fully approved, in writing, and
   provided to the local JA for legal review and advice to the Commander of the storing activity
   before the munitions storage activity may accept untagged PE items for storage. (T-0).

   activity, is responsible for preparing and petitioning the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
   Firearms, and Explosives for any exception/exemption from provisions of the Act.
3.12. Disposition of Munitions. (refer to paragraph 9.7 for DoD level munitions disposition
guidance)
   3.12.1. The Military Munitions Rule (MMR). The EPA MMR (hereinafter referred to as
   MMR) amended Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations requiring
   Waste Military Munitions (WMM) to be managed as a hazardous waste. The MMR is a
   federal standard rather than a national standard. Each state may either adopt the MMR or
   choose to enact a state MMR regulation that is more stringent than the Federal regulation.
   Therefore, each installation (led by its environmental function) must determine and
   understand the extent of state (or territory) adoption and compare it to MMR and DoD
   implementation policy of the MMR.
   3.12.2. Disposition of Recovered WMM. WMM are either recovered military munitions
   determined by EOD to require a Level 1 or 2 emergency response or military munitions
   designated by the appropriate AF Designated Disposition Authority (DDA), Conventional
   Munitions – Hill AFB or Air Superiority Missiles (ASM) - Robins AFB, as no longer
   acceptable for any useful purpose and requires routine disposition. (T-0).3.12.2.1. A “Level
   1” emergency response (Immediate Response) involves a recovered explosive item that is not
   safe to transport or store and typically requires immediate in-place destruction. A Level 1
   response is directed by the Installation Commander and does not require DDA approval prior
   to disposal. A Level 1 emergency response item shall never be transported to or stored in the
   MSA.
42                                                                AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


     3.12.2.1. A “Level 2” emergency response (Imminent and Substantial Endangerment
     Response) involves a recovered explosive item that is not immediately dangerous and can
     be temporarily transported and stored awaiting state notification or permits for local
     destruction. A Level 2 response is directed by the Installation Commander and does not
     require DDA approval prior to disposal. When Level 2 emergency response item is
     turned over to the MSA for temporary storage, the EOD specialist will annotate
     “IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT RESPONSE (Level 2)” on the
     FOB Turn-in document.
     3.12.2.2. A “Routine” response involves a recovered explosive item that is declared safe,
     is excess, obsolete, or has non-hazardous damage beyond economical repair. An AF
     DDA is the only approval authority for “Routine” disposition of military munitions items
     as WMM. When a Routine response item is turned over to the MSA for storage, the
     EOD specialist will annotate “ROUTINE” on the FOB turn-in document.
     3.12.2.3. When on-hand, issued, or in-use military munitions are turned-in, inspected, or
     used and subsequently identified as unserviceable, excess, obsolete, or have non-
     hazardous damage beyond economic repair, munitions personnel will request disposition
     from a DDA IAW paragraph 3.12.14
  3.12.3. EPA or State Authorization to Treat WMM. Installations can be EPA or state
  authorized for treatment of WMM as RCRA hazardous waste in specified Open Burn/Open
  Detonation (OB/OD) units. Where a treatment permit has been issued or interim status pre-
  permitting authorization obtained by the installation, WMM shall be managed IAW the
  EPA/state permit or interim status rules.
     3.12.3.1. When the EPA and/or a state environmental regulatory agency (or host nation
     equivalent) grants an emergency disposal permit or authorization, items will be disposed
     of IAW emergency disposal procedures. (T-0).
     3.12.3.2. If the EPA/state agency does not grant an emergency disposal permit or other
     authorization, the installation environmental and legal offices shall immediately elevate
     the issue to the MAJCOM munitions staff and environmental offices and the regional
     USAF environmental office for resolution.
  3.12.4. DDAs. The AF DDA for conventional munitions other than ASM is at Hill AFB.
  The AF DDA for ASM is at Robins AFB.
  3.12.5. Identification of Hazardous Waste/WMM. Units will not identify unused military
  munitions as hazardous waste unless authorized by an AF DDA, EOD (Level 1 or 2
  Response), or the installation commander. (T-1).
     3.12.5.1. Once authorization is granted to identify a munitions item as WMM, units shall
     comply with all applicable environmental requirements. (T-0).
     3.12.5.2. When a munitions asset is declared WMM during an emergency or routine
     response, EOD (Level 1) or the munitions activity (Level 2 and Routine) will
     immediately request the installation environmental function obtain the necessary permit
     or oral authorization from Federal, State and/or local authorities. (T-0). Oral
     authorizations must be documented by the installation environmental office who must
     follow-up with the agency to assure a complete record is maintained. (T-0).
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                         43


   3.12.6. Installation/Base Environmental Function. All activities that manage WMM shall
   consult with the base environmental function to determine the applicable Federal, State, and
   local laws. (T-0).
      3.12.6.1. Refer all administrative, regulatory, permit, legal, and policy conflicts/disputes
      to the installation environmental and legal offices for resolution with the appropriate
      Federal/State authority. The installation shall comply with all applicable environmental
      laws and permit conditions pending resolution of any conflict. (T-0). In resolving
      conflicts, protection of life and explosive safety will be the primary concern of the
      decision-maker and AFMAN 91-201 standards will remain in effect pending resolution.
      3.12.6.2. OCONUS locations shall follow the MMR environmental requirements in this
      AFI unless a conflict exists with host-nation laws or governing standards, DoD Overseas
      Environmental Baseline Guidance Document, or Status of Forces Agreements. (T-0).
   3.12.7. Periodic Safety Evaluation. Annually, the munitions activity will request EOD re-
   evaluate munitions from Level 2 emergencies that are in temporary storage awaiting
   destruction permits to ensure they have not become an immediate hazard (e.g., Level 1
   emergency response). (T-0). Contact the supporting EOD unit immediately when the safety
   of munitions assets is in question. (T-0).
   3.12.8. Disposition of Excess Munitions. (T-2).
      3.12.8.1. Report serviceable excess via the automated serviceable excess program on the
      GACP website. Refer to the User's Guide posted under the serviceable excess link.
NOTE: MASOs should only report Master Subsidiary Relationship Group (MSRG) serviceable
excess if unique circumstances exist (e.g., mission changes, Base Realignment and Closure,
construction projects that impact capacity, loss of NEW).
      3.12.8.2. Do not report MSRG excess if current allocations or future requirements exist.
      3.12.8.3. OCONUS units must obtain MAJCOM concurrence before reporting MSRG
      excess.
   3.12.9. Disposition of DoD Stock-listed Munitions.
      3.12.9.1. When DoD stock-listed conventional munitions, missiles, and related explosive
      components become unserviceable at base level, the intent of the DoD is to ship assets to
      the appropriate location for further evaluation/screening for recycling and other utility
      before final disposition.
      3.12.9.2. Only an AF DDA may designate munitions as waste.
          3.12.9.2.1. Product Team/Integrated Product Team (PT/IPT) evaluates and
          recommends actions to the appropriate AF DDA. DDAs are designated in writing by
          the Product Group Manager (PGM) and have final disposition authority.
          3.12.9.2.2. The AF DDA response to an ADR will either direct shipment to another
          location for further evaluation/screening for resource recovery and recycling or
          designate the munitions as waste and direct shipment to an EPA permitted or interim
          status OB/OD unit.
 44                                                                 AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


         3.12.9.2.3. The AF DDA will furnish the appropriate address if the ship to location is
         an Army Depot. The MASO must assure this address is included in the
         supplementary address (blocks 45-50) of the shipping document. (T-1).
         3.12.9.2.4. If the AF DDA directs shipment to another installation, the originating
         MASO must assure compliance. (T-1).
      3.12.9.3. If the AF DDA has no alternative disposition for the munitions, the base will
      receive notification to dispose.
         3.12.9.3.1. Segregate waste munitions from serviceable/unserviceable assets. (T-1).
         3.12.9.3.2. Clearly mark waste munitions. (T-1). Such identification may be by
         individual unit, pallet load, igloo, etc.
         3.12.9.3.3. Separate storage facilities are not required for munitions designated as
         waste provided that all requirements of the MMR or applicable state law are met and
         DoD Explosive Safety Board (DDESB) standards are followed.
      3.12.9.4. Initiate ADRs on unserviceable CC-H/CC-P assets upon inspector
      classification. (T-1). Once disposition instructions have been provided, units may
      accumulate assets for quarterly consolidated shipments unless otherwise directed on the
      ADR.
NOTE: Submit ADR for CC-F assets only when no repair DoDAAC is available in CAS.
Submit ADR for CC-E/CC-G assets when they are excess to requirements or repair
capability/resource constraints indefinitely prevent maintenance.
      3.12.9.5. The MMR provides that munitions which are stored in compliance with all
      requirements of the rule, including the requirement to meet DDESB standards, are not
      considered ‘waste’ by EPA until the munitions leave the magazine door en route to a
      non-military owned or operated treatment, storage, or disposal facility.
      3.12.9.6. The MMR provides that munitions that are deteriorated or damaged to the point
      that the munitions cannot be put into a serviceable condition, and cannot reasonably be
      recycled or used for other purposes, are WMM while in storage. When deteriorated or
      damaged munitions are identified, base munitions personnel should notify the
      Environmental Function to determine if the state or territory has adopted the MMR
      Conditional Exemption for storage and to ensure the required regulatory notifications are
      made. If the Conditional Exemption is not available, the supporting EOD unit should be
      contacted to address the WMM as an emergency response (Level 1 or Level 2).
      3.12.9.7. Unserviceable and non-repairable inert munitions items and accessories with
      DEMIL code other than ‘F’ and valued at $500 or less per item, which cannot be used for
      local training, may be approved for disposal by the MASO using the CAS ADR process.
      Disposal will be IAW DoD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual, DoD
      4160.28-M Vol. 2, and DoD 4160.28-M Vol. 3, Defense Demilitarization: Procedural
      Guidance. (T-0). Refer to AFI 20-110 for disposition of NWRM assets.
      3.12.9.8. Unserviceable, inert munitions items and accessories with DEMIL code ‘F’
      valued at $500 or over may have utility as spare parts and related historical data could be
      used for trend analysis. Submit ADR in CAS to the appropriate AF DDA. (T-1).
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                      45


  3.12.10. Disposition of DoD Non-Stock-listed Munitions.
     3.12.10.1. MASOs may authorize local disposition of research, development, test, and
     evaluation assets, or excess items that have been used in research and development
     projects/tests if project managers cannot return them to an original configuration (L10
     stock-listed items). Project managers are responsible for providing disposition
     instructions and for all costs associated with disposal.
     3.12.10.2. Assets subjected to temperature treatment, vibration, or impact testing
     (regardless of stock-listed status) are considered unserviceable will not be returned for
     issue or redistribution. (T-0).
     3.12.10.3. After a non-stock-listed munitions item has been used/considered for use in a
     test or evaluation program, the asset will be evaluated to determine its safety and proper
     identification. Project managers are responsible for costs associated with obtaining
     proper safety/identification evaluation if this cannot be determined by local agencies.
        3.12.10.3.1. If assets cannot be properly identified, meet Hazard Classification (HC)
        requirements, DOT requirements, or otherwise accepted for another program they
        should, on a case-by-case, be considered for local treatment/demilitarization.
        3.12.10.3.2. If the safety of an asset (from a storage and handling aspect) cannot be
        determined with certainty, treat the asset as a Level 2 response and coordinate its
        treatment/disposal with the base environmental function, EOD, and the appropriate
        AF DDA. (T-0). The installation commander has the final disposition authority.
  3.12.11. Disposition of COTS, Non-Stock-listed, Military Munitions.
     3.12.11.1. Request disposition for munitions purchased through the COTS through the
     ADR process. (T-1). If local stock numbers are assigned, list a DoD stock-listed item
     that the COTS munitions asset is closely related to (i.e., shotgun shells, 9mm hollow-
     point) in the remarks section.
     3.12.11.2. Commanders have ‘cradle-to-grave’ responsibility for COTS munitions
     purchased at the local level that are not approved for munitions system management, but
     have received Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board (NNMSB) approval. (T-1). This
     includes all use outside the MSA and final disposition of malfunctions, residue, and
     excess.
  3.12.12. Disposition of Non-Stock-listed, Non-Military Munitions.
     3.12.12.1. When munitions found on base or turned in from amnesty boxes are delivered
     to the MSA, munitions personnel will ensure that EOD or Security Forces Squadron
     (SFS) have determined whether item(s) are derived from any military source. (T-1). If
     this determination can be made with certainty, follow disposition instructions contained
     in paragraph 3.12.2.
     3.12.12.2. If it cannot be determined if the item(s) are from a military source, or safe
     from a storage and handling aspect, treat item(s) as a Level 2 response and coordinate its
     disposal with the base environmental function and EOD. (T-1).
        3.12.12.2.1. The installation Commander has the final disposition authority.
46                                                                 AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


        3.12.12.2.2. If the decision is made to dispose, existing USAF OB/OD Units should
        be considered based on cost effectiveness. Prior to selecting an existing OB/OD Unit,
        the following conditions must exist:
            3.12.12.2.2.1. When explosive assets are declared Level-2, the munitions activity
            shall initiate actions through the local base/installation environmental function
            IAW paragraph 3.12.8. (T-1).
            3.12.12.2.2.2. The receiving installation OB/OD Unit must be EPA permitted to
            treat the type and quantity of munitions requiring disposal and to receive those
            waste munitions from off-site sources for disposal.
  3.12.13. Disposition of unserviceable Foreign Military Sales (FMS) munitions
  generated at AF installations.
     3.12.13.1. The host installation FMS manager must request the installation munitions
     unit initiate disposition action for any FMS munitions in writing. (T-1).
     3.12.13.2. The munitions unit will initiate an ADR IAW paragraphs 3.12.18 and
     3.13.6; and below as requested by the host installation FMS manager. (T-1).
     3.12.13.3. Process assets with an NSN in CAS as an ORG TIN and assets with no NSN
     in CAS as Non-CAS ADR. (T-1).
     3.12.13.4. The ADR will include: (T-1)
        3.12.13.4.1. The reason for reporting.

      the AF DDA.
      3.12.14.4. Manage and file the ADR document IAW Attachment 6.
   3.12.15. Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA).
      3.12.15.1. In addition to level 1 and level 2 emergency, and routine EOD responses,
      USAF officials, including local military commanders, may be directed/required in
      Immediate Response Authority (IRA) situations to provide EOD support to domestic
      local civilian law enforcement agencies IAW AFI 10-801, Defense Support to Civil
      Authorities (DSCA).
      3.12.15.2. Hazardous military explosives items or improvised explosive devices will not
      be returned to the MSA for storage unless directed by higher authority. (T-1).
      3.12.15.3. Requests from civil authorities for non-immediate EOD support (e.g.,
      materials not of DoD origin) will be subject to approval by the Secretary of Defense. (T-
      0). Examples of non-immediate DoD EOD support include use of DoD materials,
      equipment, and USAF munitions storage facilities.
3.13. Management of Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH).
   3.13.1. MPPEH. Material owned or controlled by the DoD (to include DoD contractors as
   provided in contracts) that, prior to determination of its explosives safety status, potentially
   contains explosives or munitions. MPPEH typically includes munitions containers and
   packaging material; debris remaining after munitions use, demilitarization, or disposal; and
   range-related debris. MPPEH also includes material that potentially contains a high enough
   concentration of explosives that the material presents an explosive hazard (e.g., equipment,
   drainage systems, holding tanks, piping, or ventilation ducts that were associated with
   munitions production, demilitarization, disposal operations).
   3.13.2. Excluded from MPPEH is:
      3.13.2.1. Munitions within the DoD-established munitions management system.
      Munitions maintained, stored, transported, and utilized within the operational stockpile
      are not considered MPPEH. This includes empty containers temporarily retained for
      repacking assets in maintenance or in-use for current operations.
      3.13.2.2. Air Force owned munitions in the possession of defense contractors when the
      requirements of DoD 4140.62 is complied with by the contractor as provided in contracts.
      3.13.2.3. Munitions containers or packaging material that can be positively identified as
      explosive free through normal visual means are not considered MPPEH. These
      containers are inspected, certified, marked, sealed, segregated, and disposed of IAW
      DoDI 4140.62; DoD 4160.28-M, Vol. 1, 2, and 3; and T.O. 11A-1-60.
      3.13.2.4. Military munitions or material transferred within or released from DoD control
      that are used for their intended purposes. Transfer or release occurs when a receiver has
48                                                                AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


     acknowledged receipt of MDAS IAW paragraph 3.13.3.2 or MDEH IAW paragraph
     3.13.3.3 by signing the DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document (or
     equivalent document) and has taken physical custody of the MDAS or MDEH from a
     DoD activity.
  3.13.3. MPPEH Inspection and Documentation. (T-0). Inspect, certify, and document
  Ammunition, Explosives, Dangerous Articles (AEDA), AEDA residue, MMPEH, range
  residue, and explosives-contaminated property IAW DoD 4160.21-M, DoD 4160.28-M, Vol.
  1, 2, and 3, DoDI 4140.62, and T.O. 11A-1-60. All generated MPPEH requires inspection
  and documentation by qualified personnel to classify MPPEH as either MDAS or MDEH.
     3.13.3.1. Once MPPEH is determined to be either MDAS or MDEH, this material is no
     longer considered to be MPPEH.
     3.13.3.2. MDAS is previously generated MPPEH that has been inspected and
     documented (certified) as not presenting an explosive hazard. Once identified and
     documented as MDAS, ensure this material is not misidentified as either MPPEH or
     MDEH.
     3.13.3.3. MDEH is previously generated MPPEH that cannot be documented as MDAS,
     and includes MPPEH that has been inspected and documented to present a known
     “specific” or suspected “maximum” explosive hazard potential. Once identified and
     documented as MDEH, ensure this material is not misidentified as either MPPEH or
     MDAS. The MDEH classification only addresses the explosives safety status of material.
     EXAMPLE: If the specific explosive hazards of MDEH cannot be positively determined,
     the material is assumed to contain the “maximum” potential explosive hazard.
     3.13.3.4. Inspect and document MDAS or MDEH after a 100-percent inspection and an
     independent 100-percent reinspection or after processing by a DDESB-approved means
     with an appropriate post-processing inspection. (T-0).
        3.13.3.4.1. Documentation of MDEH will include the inspection and reinspection
        (processing and inspection) determining the explosives safety status (known or
        suspected) of the material present. Only one signature is required to document
        MDEH when a visual inspection can positively identify the known “specific” or
        suspected “maximum” explosive hazard present; otherwise two signatures are
        required.
        3.13.3.4.2. Documentation of MDAS will include the inspection and reinspection
        (processing and inspection) with two independent signatures by trained and certified
        personnel.
        3.13.3.4.3. When two signatures are required:
            3.13.3.4.3.1. The first signatory must be technically qualified and may be either a
            DoD employee or a DoD contractor. This signatory must have performed or
            witnessed the initial 100-percent inspection or DDESB-approved processing of
            the material.
            3.13.3.4.3.2. The second signatory must be a technically qualified U.S. citizen
            who may be either a DoD employee or a DoD contractor. This signatory must
            have performed or witnessed the independent 100-percent reinspection or
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                        49


            conducted an independent quality assurance inspection of processed material
            using an approved sampling method.
            3.13.3.4.3.3. Each signatory must ensure the chain of custody was maintained
            before signing the explosives safety documentation. If the chain of custody is
            found to have been broken while under DoD control, the explosives safety status
            documentation is no longer valid. The affected material will be considered
            MPPEH and shall undergo either a second 100-percent visual inspection process
            or reprocessing using a DDESB-approved methodology with appropriate post-
            processing inspection to re-establish the explosives safety status and chain of
            custody of this material.
        3.13.3.4.4. Visual inspections may be used when the explosives safety status of
        material and safety can be positively assured. (T-0).
        3.13.3.4.5. When visual inspection cannot classify MPPEH to be MDAS, document
        and manage the material as MDEH, or utilize other DDESB-approved means (e.g.,
        thermal treatment) to remove the explosive hazard, inspect, and certify as MDAS
        before release. (T-0).
        3.13.3.4.6. Utilize required documentation statements for the determination of
        material’s explosives safety status (e.g., MDAS, MDEH) per DoDI 4140.62. (T-0).
     3.13.3.5. USAF munitions personnel and qualified munitions inspector’s trained IAW
     the provisions of paragraph 3.8.4 are considered qualified to handle, inspect, and certify
     MPPEH. Refer to DoDI 4140.62 for Qualification and Training guidelines.
     3.13.3.6. Consult with the appropriate AF DDA (ASM – Robins AFB; Conventional
     Munitions – Hill AFB) and the local environmental function if a determination cannot be
     made if the residue is non-hazardous (see paragraph 9.7.5). (T-0). Report findings from
     the test to GACP for consolidation for future reference. (T-2).
  3.13.4. Controlling MMPEH, MDAS, and MDEH. Control, manage, and segregate
  MPPEH, MDAS, and MDEH to maintain a continuous chain of custody and prevent its
  unauthorized use, transfer, or release. (T-0). Comply with supply chain materiel
  management policies and explosive safety standards IAW management procedures and
  processes in Chapter 7. (T-1).
     3.13.4.1. Establish and maintain a chain of custody for all MPPEH, MDAS, and MDEH
     through its life-cycle until transfer, expenditure, or disposal. (T-0). Utilize existing CAS
     and munitions management procedures and processes in Chapter 7 to maintain a chain
     of custody for these assets. (T-1). Existing physical, transactional, and informational
     processes all contribute to maintaining a chain of custody.
     3.13.4.2. IAW DoDI 4140.62, MPPEH will be managed and processed (e.g., sorted,
     vented, inspected, segregated, secured) on the operational range or at the point of use to
     minimize handling and transport prior to processing and to facilitate disposition. (T-0).
     In certain circumstances, the movement of MPPEH from either the operational range or
     point of use could require its management as WMM under applicable Federal or State
     requirements.
 50                                                                 AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


          3.13.4.2.1. Air Force units, organizations, and activities that generate range-related
          debris are responsible for managing security, custody, inspection, and documentation
          of MPPEH and MDEH from collection through its disposition or release from DoD
          control as MDAS.
NOTE: Air Force munitions personnel secure, manage, inspect, and document MPPEH, MDEH,
or MDAS only when it is returned to the base or installation MSA for processing.
          3.13.4.2.2. Operational units and ranges will minimize the physical transfer of
          explosive residue or munitions constituents from MPPEH during the management and
          disposition process. (T-1).
      3.13.4.3. Generating activities collect MPPEH, MDAS, and MDEH (e.g., scrap, waste,
      and residue) and will identify assets, segregate the materiel, and determine the point at
      which no further material will be added to prevent comingling. (T-0). Generated
      MPPEH, MDAS, and MDEH explosive, incendiary, and chemical ammunition is
      dangerous and will never be commingled with other types of property.
      3.13.4.4. Ensure that containers and holding areas to process, manage, segregate, and
      control MPPEH, MDAS, and MDEH are located in secure areas and included in local
      facility threat assessments, when conducted by Resource Protection personnel. (T-1)
      These containers and holding will be secured and clearly marked as to identify:
          3.13.4.4.1. The hazards (if any) that may be present. (T-0).
          3.13.4.4.2. The explosives safety status of the material present. This consists of
          documentation of the processing and inspection of MDAS supported with two
          independent signatures by trained and certified personnel IAW paragraph 3.13.3.
      3.13.4.5. AF units and organizations contact DLA Disposition Services for guidance on
      availability of containers for use at the source, by scrap generators. (T-2).
   3.13.5. Transfer or Release of MPPEH. USAF munitions personnel will only transfer or
   release MPPEH and MDEH to those DoD components, activities, and personnel that meet
   the requirements for certification, licensing and permits, transportation, training, and
   experience outlined in DoDI 4140.62. (T-0).
      3.13.5.1. USAF personnel will not release MPPEH to non-DoD entities for possession,
      management, or processing. (T-0).
      3.13.5.2. Contracts or other legal agreements to transfer or release MPPEH to non-DoD
      entities are the responsibility of the generating activity. AF munitions activities and
      personnel do not generate MPPEH and therefore do not establish or fund contracts for
      release of MPPEH to non-DoD entities.
      3.13.5.3. Explosive hazards must be identified and documented prior to the transfer of
      any MPPEH, MDEH, or MDAS within the DoD; transfer of MDEH to a qualified
      receiver; or release of MDAS to the public. (T-0).
      3.13.5.4. A legible copy of the explosives safety status documentation shall accompany
      documented material upon its transfer from DoD control. (T-0). DoD Components
      generating MPPEH will maintain copies of explosives safety status documentation for 3
      years after release from DoD control. (T-0).

  3.13.6. Munitions and MPPEH Demilitarization/Disposal Documentation Procedures.
     3.13.6.1. All ADR munitions assets authorized for demilitarization or disposal must be
     processed using program Create ADR Shipment (AMI28A). (T-1).
         3.13.6.1.1. When the demilitarization or disposal activity is not on the same base as
         the munitions account processing the A5J input, the DoDAAC of the base where the
         demilitarization or disposal activity is located must be entered as the “Ship to”
         address. (T-1).
            3.13.6.1.1.1. Demilitarize inert, empty, or non-explosive munitions and
            components according to their DEMIL Code. (T-1). When munitions flight
            personnel conduct the demilitarization, the base DLA Disposition Services
            DoDAAC will be the “Ship to” address.
            3.13.6.1.1.2. Ship MDAS which have not been demilitarized or processed as
            scrap to central disposal activities per paragraph 7.13. (T-1). Process these
            shipments using the ‘Shipment For Disposal’ selection within Create ADR
            Shipment (AMI28A). (T-1).
            3.13.6.1.1.3. Process demilitarized or scrap MDAS not shipped through local
            deployment and distribution flight (e.g., turned over to base scrap vendors,
            recycling activity/points) using the ‘Shipment For DRMO’ selection within
            Create ADR Shipment (AMI28A). (T-1). The MASO will print name and sign in
            block 22 and date block 23 on the A5J when these assets are delivered to a base
            scrap vendor or recycling activity/point. (T-1).
         3.13.6.1.2. Demilitarize explosives or classified assets as directed by DoD 4160.21-
         M and DoD 4160.28-M, Vol. 1, 2, and 3. (T-0). Demilitarize non-explosive and non-
         classified assets per assigned demilitarization code. (T-0). Refer to the asset IDR or
         Web Federal Logistics Information System (WebFLIS) for demilitarization code,
         CIIC, and definitions.
  3.13.7. Temporary Property Accountability. (T-2).
     3.13.7.1. DLA Disposition Services: Munitions authorized for demilitarization or
     disposal according to the ADR will be scheduled for demilitarization or disposal on a
     certain date.
     3.13.7.2. Produce disposal documents no earlier than 5 duty days before the scheduled
     demilitarization or disposal date.
     3.13.7.3. Routed documents to the Munitions Inspection element for shipment inspection
     and temporary property accountability before the assets are transferred to the
     demilitarization activity or the DLA Disposition Services.
     3.13.7.4. Provided DLA Disposition Services the original A5J or SHP DD Form 1348-
     1A (if applicable) and maintain a copy in the Munitions Operations element.
     3.13.7.5. EOD:   Documents for the emergency disposal of munitions will be
     accomplished IAW paragraph 7.10.2.3.2.4.
  3.13.8. Demilitarization/Disposal Certification Procedures. (T-0).
 52                                                                    AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


      3.13.8.1. DLA Disposition Services.     If residual saleable materiel remains, the
      demilitarization official must certify that "DEMILITARIZATION HAS BEEN
      ACCOMPLISHED. THERE IS RESIDUAL MATERIEL WHICH HAS BEEN
      DOWNGRADED TO SCRAP." The stock number must be circled and the word SCRAP
      entered. The scrap materiel and the documents must be returned to DLA Disposition
      Services for processing.
      3.13.8.2. EOD. For complete destruction of items or emergency disposal actions, the
      disposal and witnessing officials must certify "DISPOSAL HAS BEEN
      ACCOMPLISHED. THERE IS NO RESIDUAL MATERIEL WHICH HAS BEEN
      DOWNGRADED TO WASTE." This statement will be annotated on the consumption
      issue document and signed by the disposal and witnessing officials.
3.14. Captured Enemy Ammunition (CEA).
   3.14.1. CEA Reporting. Report CEA when found or located to the NAF/higher
   headquarters as soon as possible. (T-2). Reports should include types, quantity, date, time,
   location, and circumstance of discovery/capture and request disposition instructions. (T-2).
   3.14.2. CEA Safety. Treat all CEA in the same manner as Unexploded Explosive Ordnance
   (UXO) and do not handle CEA until declared safe by EOD. (T-0). If possible, from a safe
   distance identify and record pertinent facts such as the date, time, location (map reference),
   type (e.g., bomb, artillery shell, rocket), quantity, size, obvious markings, and other relevant
   information (e.g., Serial Number (S/N), nation of origin).
   3.14.3. CEA Acceptance and Property Responsibility. Only competent command
   authorities (Joint Captured Materiel Exploitation Center (JCMEC), Combined Captured
   Materiel Exploitation Center (CCMEC), Joint Forces Commander, Joint Task Force
   Commander, etc.) will make determinations on whether CEA shall be disposed of in-place,
   identified and rendered safe for relocation, or retained for its inherent intelligence value. (T-
   1). Munitions personnel are not authorized to make these decisions and shall elevate any
   CEA issues through command channels. (T-1). Munitions personnel shall not take
   possession of, handle, or transport any CEA designated for emergency or routine disposal
   until declared safe by EOD. (T-0).
      3.14.3.1. After competent authorities identify and direct CEA to be retained for
      intelligence or other purpose, units may be directed to assist EOD personnel in render
      safe, handling, and relocation operations. Once certified safe by EOD personnel, CEA
      becomes the property of the United States Government and the responsibility of the DoD.
      3.14.3.2. Technically qualified personnel from other military services, coalition forces,
      or government agencies will usually take charge of CEA. When these activities take
      possession of CEA, responsibility of USAF munitions personnel or the MASO to manage
      and dispose of CEA is relinquished.
      3.14.3.3. USAF munitions personnel will only accept CEA when specifically directed by
      the Joint Captured Materiel Exploitation Center (JCMEC)/Combined Captured Materiel
      Exploitation Center (CCMEC) (CCMEC may be established for coalition operations). (T-
      0).

  3.14.4. Accounting for CEA. (T-1). Only account for CEA in CAS when there is an
  official NAF validated requirement. This requirement must be stated in a document, memo,
  or other written form, to maintain and issue CEA to USAF or other government agency
  personnel in the performance of their official duties. When a valid USAF CEA requirement
  exists, manage CEA in CAS as follows:
     3.14.4.1. Load a local pseudo CAS IDR record for CEA with all the available
     information provided from EOD.
     3.14.4.2. Process a FOB turn-in to establish accountability of CEA.
     3.14.4.3. Account for and inventory CEA in the same manner as other Air Force
     munitions.

  3.14.5. CEA Serviceability Procedure.
     3.14.5.1. Do not issue CEA known to be unserviceable or containing physical defects or
     characteristics that cause serviceability to be suspect. (T-0). Request disposition of these
     item IAW paragraph 3.14.6. (T-1).
     3.14.5.2. Serviceable and safe to handle CEA may be evacuated, collected, and stored
     wherever directed by JCMEC, MAJCOM, or NAF.
     3.14.5.3. CEA may require segregation from other munitions stocks depending on the
     degree of uncertainty about the condition and history of the CEA. Consult with the local
     Explosive Safety office, and EOD (if necessary), to determine the degree of separation
     appropriate for storage of CEA. When EOD cannot absolutely identify the condition of
     CEA, it shall be treated as Hazard Class/Division 1.1 IAW DoD 6055.09-M, DoD
     Ammunition and Explosive Safety Standards, Vol. 1, General Explosives Safety
     Information and Requirements. (T-0).
     3.14.5.4. Contact the local EOD unit or coordinate through the theater A4 to obtain

munitions organizations that administer combat plans and training programs. In a MUNS, the
CMT program is administered by the Production CMT element. Focus must be directed on the
flight’s capability to support all contingencies in tasked OPLANs with trained personnel and
deployable resources. Responsibilities outlined in this section can be expanded, as long as it
does not degrade flight combat capabilities. This element is not required for deployed units,
small and unique organizations, and munitions activities that do not support aircraft. In addition
to the responsibilities in AFI 21-101 and AFI 21-200, Combat Plans and Mobility, and Training
element personnel shall:
 78                                                                  AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014

                                            Chapter 7

              MANAGING CONVENTIONAL MUNITIONS OPERATIONS

7.1. General Munitions Operating Procedures. This chapter provides munitions management
procedures at the tactical level (installation/base). It describes the requirements and processes to
manage munitions accountability and complete CAS transactions as depicted in Figure 7.1,
Munitions Operational Flow Process (Peacetime and Wartime). These processes focus on near-
real time CAS transaction processing using automated-, direct-, or remote-input methods on the
flightline and in the munitions area during peacetime and wartime. Near-real time asset visibility
is an Air Force requirement at all levels. To the maximum extent possible, utilize available
technologies to process transactions within 1-hour. (T-3).
   7.1.1. The Munitions Operational Flow Process. All munitions activities and units use a
   single munitions operational flow process in peacetime and in wartime, at home-station and
   at deployed locations, to effectively support aircraft SGO and other missions. All munitions
   transactions are processed within CAS. (T-1). Munitions supervisors and managers must
   integrate these processes into their section, element, and crew procedures, operating
   instructions, and training plans to ensure personnel are knowledgeable of these processes. (T-
   2). Major process phases include: Planning, Execution, and Transaction as depicted in
   Figure 7.1. Each phase includes processes that occur continuously, overlap, and are not
   bound by geography or mission. The sequence or workcenter alignment of processes may
   differ locally. However, each step is essential to enable effective decision-making, assure a
   high level of accountability, near-real time CAS transaction processing accuracy, and total
   asset visibility.
       7.1.1.1. Planning Phase. Refer to Figure 7.1.
           7.1.1.1.1. Receive Demand/Requests: Munitions requests for external support are
           received from supported organizations and agencies. Munitions requests for internal
           munitions activity are derived through the munitions scheduling process, such as
           receipt, shipping, maintenance, inspection, or warehousing tasks. Integrate external
           and internal schedules to effectively meet all workload requirements. (T-1).
               7.1.1.1.1.1. Requests to support SGO are normally received in the form of an Air
               Tasking Order (ATO), flying schedule, or through AF 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying
               Schedule Coordination. When received, the controlling activity, generally
               Munitions Control will evaluate and prioritize accordingly. (T-1).
               7.1.1.1.1.2. Requests to support custody accounts and other non-flying unit
               customers are received by Munitions Operations or Munitions Control from the
               account custodian or unit representative through electronic or other
               communications. These requests are processed in CAS by munitions personnel,
               added to the munitions schedule as scheduled or unscheduled tasks, and
               accomplished to meet the customer demand. (T-1). Customer support should not
               be delayed by internal unnecessary scheduling processes or management controls.
               Focus processes on meeting customer demands and requests quickly and
               efficiently.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                      81


        7.1.1.1.2. Validate Allocation (Peacetime Only): During peacetime operations,
        ensure munitions are not expended without an approved allocation. (T-0). Remaining
        allocations are validated by Munitions Control or other controlling function using the
        Asset Level Inquiry (AMQ07A). (T-3). All munitions functions that direct, handle,
        process, deliver, and support flightline munitions have responsibilities to ensure that
        approved allocations are not exceeded. In wartime, munitions requests are only
        constrained by asset availability and safety factors.
        7.1.1.1.3. Determine Asset Availability: After validating allocations, determine
        availability of assets. Review various CAS programs for pre-built assets that satisfy
        requests using Complete Round Inquiry (AM522A), Complete Round Asset Summary
        (AM523A), etc. Determine component availability to satisfy any remaining
        quantities using Complete Round Analyzer (AMR01A), Complete Round Build-up
        (AMJ01A), etc.
        7.1.1.1.4. Component/Lot Selection: Select and utilize available pre-built assets. If
        additional assets are needed select components by lot, or requisition assets, if
        authorized.
     7.1.1.2. Execution Phase. Refer to Figure 7.1.
 82                                                            AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


Figure 7.1. Munitions Operations Flow Plan (Peacetime and Wartime).




         7.1.1.2.1. Movement to Build/Processing Locations: Break-out selected assets,
         deliver to build-up/processing sites, and update locations using CAS Movement
         Process (AM104A). (T-1).
             7.1.1.2.1.1. Once moved to the build-up/processing site, manage locations IAW
             Movement Control OI. (T-3).
             7.1.1.2.1.2. Notify Munitions Control of any fire and hazard symbols and CIIC
             changes. (T-0).
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                        83


        7.1.1.2.2. Inspect Assets and Process Condition Codes Changes:             Perform
        appropriate inspections IAW T.O. 11A-1-10 and T.O. 11A-1-63 and any required
        preparatory or maintenance actions. (T-0). Process any required CC changes in CAS.
        (T-0).
        7.1.1.2.3. Identify CR Batch Quantity, Process WSN Build, and Build/Assemble:
        After inspections, preparatory actions, and CC updates are completed, begin the CAS
        CR build-up process. (T-1).
           7.1.1.2.3.1. Properly identify all components used to build CRs. (T-1). A WSN is
           a 14-digit code identifying the CRWC, DoDAAC, and batch number. CAS
           assigns a separate WSN for each build of a particular CRWC.
           7.1.1.2.3.2. Assembling a CR in CAS may be done either before, during, or after
           assembly of physical assets. However, to prevent mixing WSN component lots it
           is recommended that the CR assembly be processed in CAS prior to beginning the
           physical build-up/assembly. It is essential that a new WSN be generated any time
           a component lot is depleted or changes during a CR build. (T-1).
               7.1.1.2.3.2.1. When a CAS generated WSN is assigned, each CR will be
               properly marked with an abbreviated WSN IAW Attachment 1. (T-1).
               Unless prohibited by the item T.O. the CR will be conspicuously marked. (T-
               1). Marking of abbreviated WSN on chaff/flare magazine, 2.75" rockets,
               BDU-33 practice bombs, and 105MM rounds is not required.
               7.1.1.2.3.2.2. If CAS or AIT is not immediately available, document all CR
               build-up, assembly, or processing actions on an AF IMT 4331 and process CR
               actions in CAS within one-hour. (T-3). Assign and annotate a “T”
               (Temporary) designator on each CR between the CRWC and batch number
               signifying it a Temporary WSN (BL2CM-TXXX). (T-2). When CAS
               becomes available either remark the CR with the CAS assigned permanent
               WSN, or retain the temporary WSN on each CR provided that a WSN cross-
               reference list is maintained. (T-2).
               7.1.1.2.3.2.3. Additional local CR suffix markings may be used with the
               abbreviated WSN to identify munitions configurations. EXAMPLE: A CR
               wired for Triple Ejection Racks (TER) or parent-mount racks and/or (X or +)
               fin configuration; a CR marked with (BC21H-35T+) might identify a conical
               MK-82 wired for a TER “T” with the fin in the + configuration.
        7.1.1.2.4. Move to Holding Area, Load Aircraft, Release Assets to Customer: After
        CR munitions are assembled (if applicable), all assets (e.g., CR, AUR, components)
        are typically moved to holding areas awaiting custodian pick-up, to trailers and then
        holding areas for future delivery, to storage locations, or directly to aircraft parking
        locations for aircraft loading. All of these locations are loaded in CAS as facilities or
        containers allowing the use of CAS Movement Process (AM104A) to process these
        movement transactions in CAS.
           7.1.1.2.4.1. CR Movements: For CRs, use an abbreviated WSN showing the
           CRWC and the last three digits of the WSN as part of the CAS location.
           EXAMPLE: BL2CM-XXX. (T-2). Units may use remaining “location” field
 84                                                                  AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


             characters IAW their Movement Control OI. (T-3).
NOTE: CAS provides the default location for CnC moves.
             7.1.1.2.4.2. Validating Munitions Movements. Munitions managers, sections,
             and work centers must use the Storage Location Report (AM567A) to assist in
             reconciling assets in operating locations. (T-1).
             7.1.1.2.4.3. Release Assets to Requestor/Customer: External non-flying unit
             customers pick-up assets from the MSA. (T-3). Validate customer authority and
             credentials to receive/accept munitions and obtain digital or hard copy signature
             acceptance for all munitions assets released. (T-0).
          7.1.1.2.5. Pre-transaction Data Validation: Before processing any CAS receipt,
          shipment, or expenditure transaction, task data supporting a transaction must be
          validated at the “point-of-use” to ensure 100-percent accuracy. (T-1). This validation
          is a step in the “Execution” phase and is essential to support SGO or customer
          support processes. EXAMPLE: An individual processing a CAS transaction queries
          CAS to determine the correct assets loaded on an aircraft prior to processing the
          expenditure.
             7.1.1.2.5.1. Receipts and Shipments: Validate all information and data on
             receipt/shipping documents matches physical assets or exterior markings exactly
             before processing receipt and shipment transactions. (T-1). Process these
             transactions in CAS IAW paragraphs 7.9 and 7.13 as they occur throughout the
             day. (T-0).
             7.1.1.2.5.2. Flightline Movements and Expenditures: Validate flightline task
             activity before processing movement or expenditure in CAS. (T-1).
             Documentation of munitions/weapons activity on an AF IMT 4331 by munitions
             personnel and the AF IMT 2434 by the weapons expediter indicate this validation
             has been completed. See paragraph 7.11.2.3.4 for aircraft gun ammunition and
             countermeasure expenditures.
          7.1.1.2.6. Download, Recover, or Refrag Assets: If assets are not shipped or
          expended, then download, recover to the munitions area, or refrag the assets to
          another mission. This generally involves a location movement using CAS Movement
          Process (AM104A).
      7.1.1.3. Transaction Phase: Refer to Figure 7.1.
          7.1.1.3.1. Processing CAS Transactions: This phase culminates all previous steps
          within the Munitions Operations Flow Process and results in properly processed CAS
          transactions. Processing transactions in CAS changes the asset posture, stockpile
          balance, location, or asset condition. These changes are visible to stockpile managers
          at all levels and may impact logistics support decisions. Timeliness of CAS
          processing should not overshadow the importance of accuracy. CAS transactions
          may be processed by any person performing the munitions/weapons task (technician,
          inspector, bay-chief, supervisor, crew chief, weapons expediter, etc.) or personnel in a
          centralized control activity (Munitions Control, storage dispatch, etc.). Personnel
          processing CASD transactions must have a valid CAC card, an Air Force Portal
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                         85


          account, authorized CAS access by the MASO, and are assigned to perform these
          activities by munitions/weapons supervision. CAS transactions are processed using
          automated-, direct-, or remote-input methods as follows:
NOTE: Automated- or direct-input methods will not be used to process/record munitions
inventories. Only use remote input with CAS generated, manual, or digital count sheets IAW
paragraphs 7.5.8 and Attachment 3. (T-1).
              7.1.1.3.1.1. Automated-Input: Process automated-input transactions IAW this
              guidance, paragraphs 7.1.2 and 7.1.3, and published AIT equipment manuals or
              guidance. (T-1). Automated-input is the preferred CAS input method (except for
              inventories), and is the only “point-of-use” processing method. Munitions and
              weapons personnel maximize the use of AIT automated-input at units and
              installations where AIT capabilities have been bed-down. (T-1). Automated-input
              includes AIT capabilities, Hand-Held Terminal (HHT) readers, Radio Frequency
              Identification (RFID), and other machine devices enabled by secure Common
              Access Card (CAC) authentication and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
              capabilities. Automated capabilities are functional at any location the Internet is
              accessible by signing onto the web-enabled CAS system. Transactions may be
              saved in the hardware memory to be uploaded into CAS later (batch mode) or
              transmitted immediately through hard-wired or AF approved wireless technology
              to a base LAN or Wide Area Network (WAN). Munitions and Weapons
              managers must be aware of AIT capabilities and personnel training to obtain the
              full benefits of AIT automated “point of use” CAS processing and to determine
              the input method that best meets mission requirements.
              7.1.1.3.1.2. Direct-Input: Process transactions directly into CAS through key
              punch using docked, undocked, or wireless enabled computers or laptops from or
              near work locations. (T-1). Munitions and weapons personnel use direct-input
              (except for inventories) when automated-input methods are not available or
              cannot be employed effectively to streamline operational processes. (T-1). When
              using direct-input methods, processes should not be inhibited by excessive
              management controls. Munitions and Weapons managers should place emphasis
              on validation of the data captured at all steps in the operational process to ensure
              data is processed accurately and timely into CAS at periodic intervals.
              7.1.1.3.1.3. Remote-Input: Process CAS transactions using remote-input when
              automated-input and direct-input methods are not available or cannot be
              employed effectively to streamline operational processes. (T-1). Units will use
              remote-input to record and process munitions inventories. (T-1). Remote-input
              involves passing CAS transaction information (e.g., movement, expenditures)
              using secure and unsecure Land Mobile Radios (LMR), telecommunications, or
              runners to Munitions Control or other processing locations where CAS transaction
              are processed. When using remote-input, manually document all munitions and
              weapons loading activity. (T-1). Document munitions activity on the AF IMT
              4331 and document weapons loading and expenditure activity on the AF IMT
              2434 IAW AFI 21-101. (T-1). If CAS is available, once activity is completed and
              documented, information may be “remotely” called to Munitions Control or other
              controlling activity via radio/telephone for immediate CAS processing. Then,
86                                                              AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


        physically deliver the AF IMT 4331 or AF IMT 2434 to a designated location to
        validate the previously processed CAS transactions. (T-1). If CAS is not
        available, document activity and physically deliver the information to a
        designated location for future CAS processing. (T-1). Retain this documentation
        until the 100-percent movement validation is completed IAW paragraph 5.2.8.
        (T-1).
     7.1.1.3.2. Validate CAS Flightline Data Entry: This validation provides the MASO
     and munitions managers with confidence that CAS transaction history for Flightline
     activity is accurate. The Transaction History Report (AM903A) must be compared
     against the AF IMT 2434 or other supporting documents. (T-1). Discrepancies shall
     be researched and corrected. (T-0).
     7.1.1.3.3. Document Control and Management: Routing, control, and management
     of documents represent the final steps in the Munitions Operational Flow Process.
     Elimination and reduction of paper documents within this process remains an
     important goal. However, certain accountable, auditable, or other documents key to
     management review and validation must be routed to appropriate activities.
     Procedures to manage documents including routing, flow, control, and filing are
     provided in Attachment 6. Additionally, the following documentation guidelines
     apply:
        7.1.1.3.3.1. Munitions Process Documentation: Munitions/weapons managers
        and the MASO direct documentation when required by policy; when in their
        judgment, it is necessary to maintain an auditable document trail; or to validate
        data accuracy of CAS transaction processing.             In addition to required
        documentation, munitions/weapons managers must decide what level and amount
        of data recording is necessary to validate munitions activity and CAS transactions.
        Managers should avoid excessive management controls and documentation that
        delays or hinders customer support /mission execution.
        7.1.1.3.3.2. The AF IMT 4331: This is a multi-purpose form designed to record
        all types of munitions transaction/data for accountable, auditable, and non-
        accountable munitions activity during peacetime and wartime. This form is also a
        management tool that facilitates the validation of CAS transaction processing.
            7.1.1.3.3.2.1. Completing the AF IMT 4331: The first six blocks of this form
            are administrative in nature and determine what process the form will be used
            to record. The remaining blocks are used to capture individual transaction
            data related to that process. Each line is capable of recording all the necessary
            information to process a single transaction in CAS and is self-explanatory.
            This form may also be used to record movement of custody account assets
            stored within the MSA, initial transfer of assets to custodians, or receipts of
            assets from custodians.
            7.1.1.3.3.2.2. Modification of the AF IMT 4331: MAJCOMS may authorize
            local modification to the AF IMT 4331 as long as the original data elements
            are included.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                     87


            7.1.1.3.3.3. The AF IMT 2434, Munitions Configuration and Expenditure
            Document: This form is used to record weapons/munitions loaded and expended
            from aircraft. Document weapons/munitions activity and route the form IAW
            AFI 21-101. (T-1).
  7.1.2. Internet Access. CAS is a web-based system that is dependent on connectivity to the
  Internet; it is not optional. Timely and accurate munitions up-channel reporting and
  subsequent resupply efforts depend on this connectivity. Ensure CAS has continuous
  Internet connectivity to support the Air Force mission. (T-0). Where approved and when
  available, use of commercial wireless technology to speed data input is authorized.
  7.1.3. CAS Automated Identification Technology (AIT) Enablement and Use. CAS AIT
  allows technicians, weapons expediters, and supervisors use hardware and software
  applications to transmit transaction data automatically into CAS. AIT data capture and
  transaction processing occurs before, during, and after munitions/weapons processes.
  Transaction data may be saved in hardware memory for future upload into CAS or
  transmitted immediately through hard-wired or AF approved wireless devices via a base
  LAN or WAN. In addition to technical and procedural guidance for the use of AIT
  equipment located on the AF Conventional Munitions A2I site, use the following CAS AIT
  guidance:
     7.1.3.1. Processing Munitions Movements and Expenditures: Except where stated
     otherwise, process transactions in CAS as actions occur throughout the day using AIT
     equipment such as HHT scanners. (T-3). If AIT capability is not available or functional,
     maximize the use of direct-input IAW paragraph 7.1.1.3.1.2 (T-3). If direct-input
     capability is not available or functional, then utilize remote-input IAW paragraph
     7.1.1.3.1.3 (T-3).
     7.1.3.2. Batch Mode Processing: If automated capability is available and functional, but
     wireless connectivity is unavailable, HHT scanners will operate in “Batch Mode”. In this
     mode, transactions are recorded, captured, and remain “unprocessed” in the HHT scanner
     memory until connectivity is restored through wireless connectivity or by docking the
     HHT scanner.
         7.1.3.2.1. Once connectivity is obtained (wireless or docked) all “unprocessed” batch
         mode transactions are downloaded from the HHT and uploaded into CAS AIT
         Conflict Resolution (AMP09A) program.
         7.1.3.2.2. Units with enabled AIT capabilities shall develop processes to ensure off-
         line (batch mode) transactions are processed at intervals sufficient to support the
         mission. (T-3).
     7.1.3.3. AIT Conflict Resolution (AMP09A): The CAS AMP09A program ensures that
     CAS processes transactions downloaded from HHT scanners in the chronological
     sequence that they actually occurred to avoid transaction “conflicts” within CAS.
     Transactions captured in HHT memory during offline operations are not automatically
     processed when downloaded to CAS after connectivity is restored . Downloaded CAS
     transactions must be synchronized in the chronological order based on the transaction
     date/time stamp, and prior to aircraft recovery.
88                                                                     AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


        7.1.3.3.1. To support accurate AIT data capture in an off-line environment, an AIT
        transaction captured and downloaded by one HHT scanner may not process in CAS
        because the transaction is dependent upon the download and processing of a
        transaction from another HHT scanner. EXAMPLE: In an off-line mode, Crew 1
        moves a loaded trailer from an operating location (OL1) to a holding pad (HP1) and
        then crew 2 moves the trailer from (HP1) to a flightline location (S1). If crew 2
        downloads the trailer movement transaction from HP1 to S1, CAS would create an
        error, since CAS would still show the trailer in OL1. CAS will not process the crew 2
        transaction until crew 1 downloads and processes the first movement transaction
        (OL1 to HP1).
        7.1.3.3.2. Units using AIT must monitor the AIT Conflict Resolution (AMP09A)
        program on a daily basis to ensure outstanding transactions are being cleared and
        processed in CAS. (T-3).
     7.1.3.4. AIT Barcode Labels: To automate the data entry process, CAS provides the
     capability to print two-dimensional AIT barcode labels. Barcode data identifiers tell the
     HHT scanner what type of data is being read and where it should be placed on the HHT
     screen. The following types of labels can be printed using a standard desktop printer or a
     hip printer attached to the HHT:
        7.1.3.4.1. Warehouse Label: The warehouse label contains the structure and
        location, and when scanned displays the contents of that location. Place the
        warehouse label on corner markers to identify a specific structure location. (T-1). If
        corner markers cannot be utilized, affix labels to walls, clipboards, signs, or other
        means to clearly display labels to meet operational needs. (T-1).
        7.1.3.4.2. Container Label: The container label contains the container ID and IUID,
        and when scanned displays the container and any assets within the container. Place
        the container label near the field number or at a location that best facilitates visibility
        and ease of use. (T-1).
        7.1.3.4.3. WSN Label: The WSN label contains a WSN, and when scanned will
        select that specific WSN. Place the WSN label on the munitions item in a location
        that best facilitates visibility when installed on an aircraft (e.g., fin or airfoil group for
        bombs and near the missile S/N). (T-1).
        7.1.3.4.4. Asset Label: The asset labels; if used, contains the mandatory data
        elements for marking munitions, and are applied IAW MIL-STD-129. (T-0). All
        available asset information is pre-populated based on the indicative data record and
        user input. All data elements are editable and users must ensure that data is accurate.
        (T-0). The asset label can be generated for all levels of packaging. The label
        contains a unique traceability code to prevent duplicate scanning.
        7.1.3.4.5. United Nations (UN) and Performance Oriented Packaging (POP)
        markings are not included in the asset label. Users must add these markings. (T-0).
        7.1.3.4.6. Consolidated Asset Label. The consolidated asset label provides the same
        capability as the Asset Label except it allows multiple NSNs to be added to the label.
        Apply this label IAW MIL-STD-129. (T-0).
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                        89


       7.1.3.5. AIT Equipment. AFI 91-208, Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to
       Ordnance (HERO) Certification and Management requires evaluation and approval of
       AIT equipment for use around explosives. The HERO approval process identifies
       standoff distances from munitions items for specific equipment.
           7.1.3.5.1. Coordinate with ACC/A4WC prior to purchasing any AIT equipment for
           use around munitions to ensure the HERO requirements are being met. (T-0).
           7.1.3.5.2. A list of HERO approved and authorized devices is posted on the AF
           Conventional Munitions A2I SharePoint site. Units shall also coordinate purchase of
           any AIT equipment with the local Communications activity. (T-0).
   7.1.4. Structure Management. All munitions facilities, revetments/pads, Hardened Aircraft
   Structures (HAS)/PAS, aircraft parking spots, and holding areas for munitions, will be loaded
   as individual CAS structures. (T-2). This process allows assets to be moved between
   structures using the normal CAS Movement Process (AM104A) and enables the use of CAS
   management products to track assembled assets in their physical location using the Storage
   Location Report (AM567A). In addition, a structure titled “Off-Station” may be created for
   assets currently “off station” and planned to be receipted at a Forward Operating Location or
   due to return to the base.
   7.1.5. Container-in-Container (CnC) Management. CnC capability provides a parent-
   child relationship that enables the movement of a container and its contents in a single move,
   where the NEW, compatibility and CIIC of the contents are applied to the container’s
   location within a structure.
NOTE: Units may manage ready-use/operationally configured gun ammunition and
countermeasures following CnC procedures or use locally developed procedures included in a
Movement Control OI.
       7.1.5.1. Containers are categorized by “type” and “sub-type” to improve overall
       container management. Templates and naming conventions for container types and sub-
       types are pre-defined in CAS to standardize these across the Air Force. If container types
       or sub-types do not support requirements, contact your MAJCOM.
EXAMPLE: Container Type and Container Sub-Types:
Aircraft: B-1B, F-15C, F-16B30, etc.
Trailer: MHU-110, MHU-196, 40ft, etc.
ISO: 20ft side opener; 20ft end opener, etc.
SUU: SUU-25
SDB: BRU-61
MAGS: Chaff/Flare, Chaff, Flare
AGM-88: CNU-335
       7.1.5.2. Once loaded, a container ID carries a maintenance detail record. While not
       mandatory to update, they enable additional capabilities. The maintenance detail record
       varies based on container type. Aircraft detail records have information on the owning
       organization and allow the ORG/SHP code and munitions CAT Codes to be specified for
 90                                                                    AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


       all expenditures processed against the given container ID. An ISO detail record is used to
       update container information necessary to ship a loaded or empty container. All detail
       records provide the capability to check the contents being moved into it against a
       specified Complete Round Weapons Code (CRWC) or codes.
       7.1.5.3. Container IDs may be added or deleted from the system as needed by the using
       organization. Items in the context of CnC are not accountable in CAS.
           7.1.5.3.1. An accountable container may be assigned a container ID for ease of
           tracking, however it is the stock level of this NSN that is accountable, not the CnC
           container ID.
           7.1.5.3.2. Once the container ID is assigned, the accountable NSN is moved into the
           container ID, pairing the two together to make it easier to track and utilize.
       7.1.5.4. Individual Container Identification. A unique 10-digit identifier must be
       assigned to each container managed in CAS and cannot be duplicated, regardless of type
       or sub-type. Each unit will load individual containers by appropriate container type and
       sub-type using Container Maintenance (AM106A). Container ID naming conventions
       are standardized across the AF enterprise as follows:
NOTE: The Container ID Naming Convention reference list can be found on the AF
Conventional Munitions SharePoint site.
NOTE: If a “duplication” error is received in CAS contact the CAS Help Desk or submit a CAS
Trouble Ticket.
           7.1.5.4.1. Aircraft: Load the two-digit aircraft wing designator “tail flash” as
           position 1 and 2 (i.e., Langley = FF), the two-digit year of manufacture as position 3
           and 4 (i.e., 1989 = 89), and a 6-digit aircraft tail number as position 5 thru 10 (i.e.,
           FF89123456). Units are not required to update aircraft container locations in CAS.
NOTE: Units without assigned aircraft will use a two-digit Command Code of parent MAJCOM
as the tail flash designator. As follows:
0B – USAFA                                                   0D – USAFE
                      0J – AETC
0R – PACAF                                                   0M – AFRC
                      XX – AFSOC
1C – ACC                                                             1F – GACP
                                      1L – AMC
1M – AFMC                                                    1S – AFSPC
                      3X – AFCNT
4Z – ANG                                                             GS – AFGSC
           7.1.5.4.2. Trailers: Load the two-position wing designator as position 1 and 2, the
           three-digit trailer type as position 3 thru 5, and the five-digit assigned S/N as position
           6 thru 10 (e.g., FF11012345 = MHU-110 or FF25F12345 = 25FT). Units will update
           trailer container locations in CAS.
           7.1.5.4.3. Transportation Modules (Mods): Load the two-position wing designator as
           position 1 and 2, the three-digit module type as position 3 thru 5, and the five-digit
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                         91


         assigned S/N as position 6 thru 10 (e.g., FFB3312345 = BDU-33, FFRKT12345 =
         rockets, or FFC-F12345 = Chaff-Flare). Units that have loaded containers under
         Chaff and/or Flare type must move the containers to the “Chaff-Flare” type. Units
         will update module container locations in CAS.
         7.1.5.4.4. Ammunition Loaders: Load the two-position wing designator as position 1
         and 2, the three-digit loader type as position 3 thru 5, and the five-digit assigned S/N
         as position 6 thru 10 (e.g., FFALS12345 = ALS, FFLAL12345 = LAL, or
         FFUAL12345 = UALS). Units will update ammunition loader container locations in
         CAS.
         7.1.5.4.5. Magazines: Chaff/Flare, Chaff, Flare Magazines (MAGS): Load the two-
         position wing designator as position 1 and 2, the three-digit MAG type as position 3
         thru 5, and the five-digit assigned S/N as position 6 thru 10 (e.g., FFA4812345 =
         ALE-48, FFA5012345 = ALE-50, FFCFM12345 = Chaff/Flare magazine). (T-2).
         Units are not required to update magazine container locations in CAS. (T-3).
         7.1.5.4.6. ISO Containers: Load the four-digit ISO designator as position 1 thru 4
         (e.g., USAF or USFU) and the 6-digit S/N as position 5 thru 10 (i.e., USAF123456).
         Units will update ISO container locations in CAS when loaded with explosives. (T-1).
         7.1.5.4.7. Missile Containers: To facilitate updated NEWQD capabilities in CAS,
         missile container IDs will be loaded as follows: Load the two-digit aircraft wing
         designator as position 1 and 2, the three-digit container type as position 3 thru 5, and
         the five-digit assigned container S/N as position 6 thru 10 (e.g., FF43112345 = CNU-
         431 or FF35512345 = CNU-355). (T-1). Units will update missile container locations
         in CAS when they contain missiles. (T-1).
         7.1.5.4.8. SDB (BRU-61 Racks): To facilitate managing individual SDB munitions
         loaded on BRU-61 racks, SDB container IDs will be loaded as follows: Load the
         two-digit aircraft wing designator as position 1 and 2, the three-digit SDB (BRU-61)
         container type as position 3 thru 5, and the five-digit assigned container S/N as
         position 6 thru 10 (e.g., FFB6112345 = BRU-61). (T-1). Units will update SDB
         locations on SDB (BRU-61) containers. (T-1).
  7.1.6. NWRM Management. Effective management, accountability, Positive Inventory
  Control (PIC), and Total Asset Visibility (TAV) is essential for classified munitions assets, to
  include CAS-managed NWRM assets.
     7.1.6.1. Policy for CAS-managed NWRM management include this AFI which provides
     CAS processes applicable to all classified munitions assets and procedures for NWRM
     receipt, in-check, inspection, stockpile surveillance, warehousing, inventory,
     accountability, and shipment; AFI 20-110 which provided NWRM roles, responsibilities,
     and discrepancy reporting procedures; and AFI 24-203 which provides procedures for
     NWRM transportation documentation, marking, and packaging. All of these must be
     used in conjunction with this AFI for proper NWRM management. For specific NWRM
     procedures, refer to the various processes throughout Chapter 7 of this AFI.
     7.1.6.2. The following requirements apply to all CAS-managed NWRM items:
 92                                                                    AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


           7.1.6.2.1. Nomenclatures for CAS-managed NWRM NSNs will be preceded by
           “NWRM” in the IDR. (T-0).
           7.1.6.2.2. Ensure items managed in CAS have the time change indicator set to “Y”.
           (T-0).
           7.1.6.2.3. All NWRM assets in shipment are subject to Classified and Sensitive
           Munitions Shipment oversight and validation procedures IAW paragraph 7.13.4.7
           before NWRM shipments are removed from the CAS Intransit Table IAW. (T-0).
           7.1.6.2.4. Maintenance processing for CAS-managed NWRM:
              7.1.6.2.4.1. Account for and track NWRM by S/N on the CAS stock record
              throughout the entire maintenance process. Include these procedures in the local
              Movement Control OI IAW paragraph 5.1.1.4 (T-1).
              7.1.6.2.4.2. Use DIFM consumption issue procedures IAW paragraph 7.10.2.3.3
              for NWRM items issued to replace installed components. (T-1).
              7.1.6.2.4.3. DIFM issued NWRM assets disassembled for maintenance are
              subject to inventory procedures IAW paragraphs 7.5.8 (stock) or 7.8.4 (custody)
              and Attachment 3. (T-0).
   7.1.7. Local Stock Numbers. Local stock numbers are created using CAS Load Local
   IDR/IDR Challenge (AMD03A).
       7.1.7.1. Assets with a Part Number (P/N) greater than 8 characters will be loaded with a
       Local “L” identifier in CAS as a local stock number. (T-2). In this case, a P/N “P”
       identifier will not be used in the National Item Identification Number field. (T-2). CAS
       will truncate any digits beyond the “P” plus the 8 character P/N causing the asset to lose
       its P/N identity. This constitutes a valid requirement to assign an “L” control in CAS.
       Units are not required to submit an AF IMT 86, Request for Cataloging Data/Action.
       7.1.7.2. If no P/N exists for non-accountable containers that are not stock listed, enter the
       following data elements as shown and enter any remaining data elements as required (T-
       3):
           7.1.7.2.1. Local Stock Number: “8140PCONTAINERS”.
           7.1.7.2.2. Unit Cost: “0.01”.
NOTE: If the unit procured non-accountable boxes, packaging, or crates locally, use the local
procurement cost per container.
           7.1.7.2.3. Source of Supply: “999”.
           7.1.7.2.4. Noun: Use a plain language description of the non-accountable container
           (Wirebound Crate RR-170 Chaff, 20mm Ammo Trays, etc.)
7.2. MASO Management of Munitions.
   7.2.1. Establishing and Operating the Munitions DoDAAC. The MASO establishes the
   Munitions DoDAAC IAW paragraph 9.1. There is only one appointed MASO per
   DoDAAC. An alternate MASO is not authorized. As such, the MASO operates the
   munitions account and may pre-appoint delegates, in writing, to operate and manage account
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                         93


   activity to include signing specified documents and listings. The MASO will sign the
   certificate of transfer and all inventory adjustments.
   7.2.2. MASO Task Accomplishment and Delegations. Specific MASO accomplished
   tasks and authorities/responsibilities that may be delegated are outlined within Table 7.1,
   MASO Task Accomplishment and Delegations Authority. The MASO ensures required
   documentation is controlled IAW Attachment 6 and signed IAW Attachment 6, Table
   A6.1.
         7.2.2.1. The term “MASO will” indicates a task/responsibility accomplished by the
         MASO. These tasks can only be delegated when the MASO is absent from the duty
         section for at least one entire duty day. This “absence” rule applies to MASO
         accomplished tasks listed in the left column of Table 7.1.
         7.2.2.2. The term “MASO must ensure” indicates a task/responsibility that the MASO
         may delegate even when not absent from the duty section. These tasks are listed in the
         right column of Table 7.1. MASO, Munitions Operations element, or accountability
         tasks within this AFI not listed in Table 7.1. are considered “Must Ensure” tasks and may
         be delegated.

      7.2.2.3. Regardless of delegation authority, the MASO is responsible for account
      management and ensuring a clear understanding of responsibility and authority that
      accompanies each level of delegation.
             7.2.2.3.1. If clear responsibility and authority cannot be maintained during a period
             of delegation, Munitions Supervision or the MASO should advise the appointing
             authority to consider transferring the account to a new MASO.
             7.2.2.3.2. Only an NCO, Officer, or civilian having a detailed working knowledge of
             munitions accountability procedures will be given MASO delegation. (T-1).
  7.2.3. Munitions Customer Guides and Munitions Customer Information Matrix. The
  MASO ensures that munitions owning and using organizational commanders and custodians
  are familiar with the policies, responsibilities, and procedures of this AFI, those listed on the
  AF Form 68, and the Munitions Customer Information Matrix provided in Attachment 4. (T-
  1). When used in conjunction with the briefing topics on the AF Form 68, this matrix
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                      95


   replaces the requirement to develop a separate Munitions Customer Guide. Units who
   develop a separate Munitions Customer Guide to aid customers will review and update these
   guides IAW AFMAN 33-363. (T-1).
   7.2.4. Off-Line Processing (Post-Post). Off-line processing operations are used as an
   interim measure when CAS system operation is disrupted. Units will notify their MAJCOM
   when their CAS systems operation has been down exceeds 24 hours. (T-2). Post-post
   operations allow continued support during periods of computer downtime. The MASO is
   responsible for initiating post-post procedures and recovering IAW Attachment 2 and
   MAJCOM/NAF guidance.
NOTE: The intent and focus of Post-Post recovery is to update CAS records to match the asset’s
current physical location, not to process every asset movement that occurred during off-line
processing.
   7.2.5. Conventional Munitions Restricted or Suspended (CMRS). (T-1).
       7.2.5.1. Custody Account CMRS Procedures: When CMRS notices are received, the
       MASO ensures that account custodians with affected assets are notified verbally. Within
       24-hours, a follow-up notification will be sent to affected custodians and their
       commander electronically via e-mail using the Outlook® read receipt option. As a
       minimum, notifications to custody accounts shall include:
          7.2.5.1.1. NSN and Nomenclature.
          7.2.5.1.2. Lot or SNs.
          7.2.5.1.3. Applicable suspension, restriction or release notice.
          7.2.5.1.4. Specific suspension or restriction.
          7.2.5.1.5. Required turn-in action including date and time.
          7.2.5.1.6. Availability of replacement assets.
       7.2.5.2. Consumption Account CMRS Procedures: Consumption account users/units
       (e.g., Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE), Egress, P&S, etc.) will monitor the CMRS
       system for restricted or suspended munitions items.
          7.2.5.2.1. The MASO must brief consumption account users using the AF Form 68,
          Part II, Briefing Statement to make them aware of their responsibilities to register,
          obtain access, and utilize the CMRS system on the GACP website to receive auto-
          notifications of daily updates for installed aircraft/AFE munitions. Refer to the
          CMRS section of the GACP website for instruction to assist AFE users in developing
          their CMRS training. Auto-notifications from the CMRS system include:
              7.2.5.2.1.1. NSN and Nomenclature.
              7.2.5.2.1.2. Lot or SNs.
              7.2.5.2.1.3. Applicable suspension, restriction or release notice.
              7.2.5.2.1.4. Specific suspension or restriction.
 96                                                                  AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


          7.2.5.2.2. When receiving AFE equipment from another installation, AFE personnel
          will verify records to ensure installed munitions are not affected by CMRS restriction
          or suspension and are suitable for their intended purpose.
          7.2.5.2.3. Munitions assets affected by CMRS or otherwise unsuitable for their
          intended purpose will be removed from AFE. Units contact the local munitions
          organization to initiate turn-in, requisition, and request issue for replacement assets.
7.3. Forecasting Procedures.
   7.3.1. General Forecasting Guidance. Implement forecasting procedures IAW this AFI
   and guidance published annually in the PCAR memorandum distributed by the GACP.
      7.3.1.1. MASO: Ensures forecasts are submitted and allocation procedures followed
      IAW the guidance in this AFI, GACP PCAR memorandum, MAJCOM munitions staff,
      and data provided from MUFMs. (T-1).
          7.3.1.1.1. The MASO is responsible for AMST validation of unit level Host
          command forecasts and other using command forecasts that have been validated by
          the assigned custodian prior to the assigned MAJCOM due date, remaining forecast
          records are the responsibility of the using MAJCOM MUFM.
          7.3.1.1.2. The MAJCOM MUFMs are responsible for PCAR forecasts identified for
          MUFM level validation. The applicable MAJCOM suspense date will apply.
          7.3.1.1.3. The MASO validates that DoDAAC forecasts were input, but does not
          validate the functional user’s requirements.
      7.3.1.2. MUFM: The MUFM is the central focal point for all functional area munitions
      requirements for base level users assigned to or within their functional areas. The
      MUFM ensures that functional area munitions forecasts are prepared, submitted, and
      managed IAW AFI 21-201 and annual PCAR guidance for their functional area.
      Additionally, the MUFM shall (T-1):
          7.3.1.2.1. Task each subordinate unit to develop and submit requirements to the
          MUFM or the MUFM may centrally develop and submit their functional
          requirements. If the MUFM does not develop functional requirements centrally,
          notify and direct subordinate units to seek assistance from the MASO to developing
          their forecast for submission to the MUFM.
          7.3.1.2.2. Develop (e.g., collect, consolidate, and validate) or consolidate their
          functional area munitions requirements forecast and submit the consolidated forecast.
             7.3.1.2.2.1. Validate all unit or consolidated forecasts for accuracy and
             completeness (e.g., CRC, DODIC, and NSN) on the consolidated forecasts using
             the capabilities of the AMST FAM.
             7.3.1.2.2.2. Submit forecasts in the AMST FAM on the GACP website for
             inclusion in the 5-year munitions forecast.
          7.3.1.2.3. Seek assistance from the MASO or MAJCOM (or NAF) munitions staff
          (or equivalent) to build and submit forecasts. The munitions staff does not validate
          other functional area user requirements.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                      97


      7.3.1.3. Account Custodians: Request and obtain general-user access to AMST if
      required to submit a munitions forecast. Once the custodian has obtained AMST access,
      request level 6 access to the AMST FAM. (T-1).
   7.3.2. Missiles. To support CMT and Weapons Load Training, units will only forecast for
   non-expendable DATM/CATM missiles IAW the AF Standard For Non-expendable
   Airmunitions Training guide. (T-1). Units will not forecast for AIM/CATM requirements for
   expendable or non-expendable Aircrew munitions. (T-1). ACC/A3TW centrally forecasts for
   these assets IAW AFI 11-212.
   7.3.3. NWRM. Forecasts, allocations, and distribution activity for CAS-managed explosive
   and non-explosive NWRM assets is a coordinated process between MAJCOMs, GACP,
   AFNWC, AFNWC/NC, and applicable SPOs.
      7.3.3.1. CAS-managed NWRM is forecasted by field units through the MAJCOM or
      centrally by the SPO to the AFNWC or GACP. The GACP is the allocation, OOCR, and
      distribution approval authority for CAS-managed explosive NWRM. The AFNWC/NCL
      or the SPO is the allocation, OOCR, and distribution approval authority (via the GACP)
      for CAS-managed non-explosive NWRM. Once an allocation change is approved, the
      AFNWC/NC SPO coordinates with the GACP to change the DLAR using AMST.
      7.3.3.2. The AFNWC/NCL and applicable SPOs reviews and updates requirements and
      allocations annually and submits approved allocations to the GACP for update in AMST
      by 31 July each calendar year.
      7.3.3.3. The MASO at an installation/base with NWRM requirements will validate
      forecasts for all CAS-managed NWRM assets. (T-1). In some cases, host/user command
      relationships may need to be established to differentiate between managing and using
      Commands. EXAMPLE: Trainers used by an AF Global Strike Command (AFGSC)
      unit but managed by a MASO assigned to AFMC on the same base.
   7.3.4. WRM Mobility, CAT Code B. Forecast for miscellaneous mobility munitions
   covered in AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1, Ground Munitions using the Ground Munitions
   Authorization Tables (GMAT) for Ground Munitions located on the GACP website. (T-1).
   Forecast these ground munitions under a single wing mobility account, ORG/SHP code
   002BP and FUC L4. (T-1). ORG/SHP account 002BP is a forecasting and allocation
   management account only; do not expend these assets from the DoDAAC stock account or
   against ORG/SHP 002BP. (T-1).
NOTE: MAJCOMs may provide additional guidance for units managing multiple command
code mobility requirements from a single DoDAAC.
      7.3.4.1. CAT Code B munitions requirements will be validated by the functional areas
      they support (e.g., Security Forces, Civil Engineers, Prime Beef) and coordinated through
      the Installation Deployment Officer (IDO). (T-1).
      7.3.4.2. Prior to forecasting for unit CAT Code B assets the MUFM will coordinate with
      gaining MASO, or MAJCOM/NAF to ensure the assets are not already positioned and
      stocked in-place to support deployment.

  7.3.5. Cartridge Actuated Device/Propellant Actuated Device (CAD/PAD) TCI. Units
  forecast for CAD/PAD items listed in T.O. 00-20-9, Forecasting Replacement Requirements
  for Selected Calendar and Hourly Time Change Items, Table 4.1 and IAW AFI 21-101.
     7.3.5.1. CAD/PAD item end users must forecast for items not visible in the ALC
     IMDS/REMIS/G081 by using the AFTO Form 223, Time Change Requirements Forecast
     (automated or manual) IAW T.O. 00-20-9. (T-1).
     7.3.5.2. Units supporting KC-10 aircraft must also forecast for ARD 863 cartridges.
     Refer to the annual PCAR memorandum for guidance on ARD cartridge forecasting. (T-
     1).
  7.3.6. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE). AFE munitions are explosive items installed into
  aircrew survival vests, parachutes, survival kits, and life rafts. Forecast for AFE munitions as
  follows:
     7.3.6.1. For AFE munitions without an MSRC, forecast in the same manner as
     CAD/PAD munitions IAW paragraph 7.3.5. These items will be identified during the
     quarterly Munitions, P&S, and FSC meetings. (T-1).
     7.3.6.2. For AFE munitions with an MSRC, forecast IAW paragraph 14.2. OOCR
     procedures apply to these types of assets.
     7.3.6.3. AFE Replacement (Time Change) Munitions. CAT Code A is used to forecast
     replacements for assets approaching their time change interval (e.g., end of service life)
     and for predicted or known failure rates.
     7.3.6.4. AFE Munitions Initial Build-up: CAT Code T is used to forecast requirements
     for initial build-up of AFE munitions for existing or new aircraft/aircrews.
     7.3.6.5. AFE Training Munitions: CAT Code D is used to forecast aircrew pyrotechnic
     signaling devices required to support aircrew training.
  7.3.7. Non-expendable Airmunitions Training Items. Forecast for the minimum
  quantities of non-expendable airmunitions required to provide realistic munitions production,
  maintenance, and weapons load crew training utilizing non-expendable airmunitions
  authorizations in the Air Force Standard for Non-expendable Airmunitions Training located
  on the AF Conventional Munitions SharePoint site and IAW AFI 11-212, Munitions
  Requirements for Aircrew Training.
     7.3.7.1. Provide justification for forecasts that exceed the standard authorizations
     referencing validated Air Force or Higher Headquarters directives.
     7.3.7.2. Establish munitions custody accounts with Munitions Operations element and in
     CAS to manage allocations and requisitions for these training items.
  7.3.8. COTS Forecasting. COTS munitions purchases are to meet unique, non-recurring,
  short-term (less than one year) or immediate requirements for stock-listed items that are
  currently not available for requisition through normal AF distribution channels. Approved
  COTS munitions maintained longer than one year from approval date, require annual
  revalidation. (T-1).
     7.3.8.1. Long-term Munitions Requirements: The COTS process is not established to
     support long-term munitions requirements.    Units identify long-term munitions
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                         99


       requirements through the Lead Command/NAF MUFM to the Air Staff functional user
       agency. The Air Staff functional (using) agency develops and submits a Capability
       Production Document (CPD) to the appropriate ALC for long-term procurement,
       sustainment strategies, cataloging, and management. (T-1).
       7.3.8.2. The COTS Munitions Approval Process: COTS munitions will not be purchased
       or used until final written approval is obtained from the GACP COTS Munitions Program
       Manager (CMPM). (T-1). The approval process ensures the safety and health of Air
       Force personnel and accountability while supporting operational requirements.
EXCEPTION: AFMC/A4M develops and coordinate COTS guidance for all AFMC RDT&E
activities. The AFMC COTs guidance applies to all agencies supporting AFMC RDT&E
activity regardless of host unit MAJCOM.
           7.3.8.2.1. Previously Approved COTS Procedures:
              7.3.8.2.1.1. Stock listed assets listed in the JHCS/MHP or listed in the COTS
              database via the GACP website require installation level approval IAW
              paragraph 7.3.8.3. The database contains approved active, disapproved, and
              archived COTS. Units shall inform AFSFC/SFXW by e-mail of any intent to
              purchase previously approved COTS ground munitions. (T-1). Additionally, units
              inform the GACP CMPM of their intention to purchase COTS by using the e-mail
              address specified in paragraph 1.5.7. (T-1).
NOTE: for continued access to JHCS applications, users can register at the link provided in
paragraph 1.4.20.
              7.3.8.2.1.2. Units will obtain installation and ALC level approval before
              purchasing archived COTS which have an expired Interim Hazard Classification
              (IHC). (T-0).
           7.3.8.2.2. New COTS Procedures: Obtaining approval to purchase new COTS
           munitions follows a five step process that includes:
              7.3.8.2.2.1. The requesting unit must develop a COTS package that includes all
              IDR data elements listed in paragraph 7.3.8.3.1 on the manufacturer’s letterhead.
              Submit the COTS package to the MASO for review to ensure there is no like item
              in the AF inventory and there is no previously approved COTS package for a like
              item.

       Program.
7.4. Allocations and Stock Levels Management.
   7.4.1. General Allocation Guidance. A unit’s allocation is the quantity of a munition NSN
   that is expected to be available to a unit within the designated FY. The allocation provides
   authorization to requisition and use an item for its allocated purpose. Each base’s portion of
   the command allocation is distributed to the MASO via AMST. The MAJCOM/NAF may
   review, realign, or adjust unit allocations based on theater positioning objectives, unit
   requirements, and storage capabilities. Allocations are managed continuously throughout the
   munitions operational flow process to maintain timely processing, visibility, and
   accountability.
       7.4.1.1. MASO: Within 2 duty days of the new FY allocations being auto-loaded in
       CAS (e.g., 27 to 30 Sep), compare the CAS Organizational Record Listing (AM513) to
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                    103


      the AF Form 68 and AMST to validate that all ORG/SHP codes, host/user relationship
      codes, and Functional User Codes (FUC) are loaded correctly. (T-1). The MASO ensures
      only one FUC assigned to each individual ORG/SHP code (e.g., separate ORG/SHP for
      S3/Security Forces, C1/Combat Arms, S1/Dog Training). (T-1). Additionally, the
      MASO will:
         7.4.1.1.1. Use the SAAR system through the GACP website for all non-Master
         Subsidiary Relationship Group (MSRG) managed assets. (T-1).
EXCEPTION: This does not apply to approved COTS or RDT&E which will be managed IAW
paragraphs 7.3.8 and 7.16.
         7.4.1.1.2. Ensure allocations for flightline support are not consolidated into to a
         single wing account. (T-1). These allocations support ORG/SHP codes aligned to a
         specific AMU or Squadron.
         7.4.1.1.3. Approve/disapprove requests for munitions, missiles, and NWRM - TYPE
         Trainers in excess of non-expendable allocations left on custody accounts when the
         organization has a valid requirement and has submitted an Out-of-Cycle Request
         (OOCR) for the assets and the GACP, AFNWC, or SPO has not tasked the unit to
         ship these assets. (T-1). CAS allocations will not be increased to support excesses.
         (T-1).
         7.4.1.1.4. Notify customers of excess munitions requiring turn-in action by NSN,
         quantity, and CAT Code NLT 7 duty days after the allocations are auto loaded in
         CAS. (T-2).
             7.4.1.1.4.1. Freeze the custody account and take action IAW paragraph 7.8.5
             when the custodian does not schedule turn-in of identified excess. (T-2).
             7.4.1.1.4.2. Ensure excess munitions expended after MASO notification are
             processed using OOCR procedures IAW paragraph 7.4.2 (T-1).
      7.4.1.2. MUFM:        Once allocations are released, the MUFM finalizes all
      theater/command positioning decisions in AMST prior to the GAP working group
      convening. Coordinate and submit OOCR and ATR when requirements change,
      transferring allocations within their functional area, and for munitions availability
      according to paragraphs 7.4.2 and 7.4.3.
      7.4.1.3. Account Custodians: Schedules turn-in of non-expendable and expendable
      munitions excess allocations with Munitions Inspection within 14 calendar days of
      MASO notification. (T-2). Turns-in all excess annually NLT 15 Nov. (T-1).
   7.4.2. Out of Cycle Request (OOCR). Using organizations request allocation increases
   using the OOCR process in AMST. (T-1). Assets are allocated based on available and
   projected stocks and may not be 100-percent supportable. OOCRs for assets that were not
   100-percent allocated may not be approved. Contact the MUFM/MASO for guidance on
   OOCR submission.
      7.4.2.1. Only submit OOCR for allocated expendable assets when at least 70-percent of
      the allocation has been expended in CAS. (T-1). Future anticipated expenditures will not
      be used to satisfy the 70-percent expenditure requirement. (T-1).

      7.4.2.2. If end of FY expenditures are not processed in CAS prior to the FY cutoff IAW
      paragraph 7.11.4, and there is no “new” FY allocation the MASO will contact the
      appropriate MUFM who will support requirements from the “new” FY allocation or
      direct an OOCR be submitted. (T-2). In this case, submit the OOCR within 15-calendar
      days of processing the prior FY expenditure for the quantity of assets expended. (T-2).
      7.4.2.3. OOCR for all other items, OOCR for OCONUS MAJCOMs, and OOCR for new
      munitions requirements (e.g., mission changes) may be submitted at any time with
      sufficient justification.
      7.4.2.4. Prior to submitting an OOCR for munitions other than aircrew training:
         7.4.2.4.1. The custodian will initiate the OOCR in AMST by citing the authorizing
         directive, formula, and expenditure data (if applicable). (T-1).
         7.4.2.4.2. The MASO will validate the OOCR data and reported expenditures. (T-1).
         If valid, the MASO may convert the OOCR to an ATR and transfer from other
         accounts within their DoDAAC; when they contain the same “Using” command code.
         The MASO may also redistribute unused allocations within the DoDAAC by
         completing an ATR in AMST IAW paragraph 7.4.3. (T-1).
         7.4.2.4.3. If the MASO is unable to support the OOCR, the MASO will update the
         OOCR in AMST. (T-1). The OOCR is automatically forwarded to the next review
         level.
         7.4.2.4.4. The MUFM with MAJCOM/NAF munitions staff assistance will attempt
         to transfer allocations between functional areas within their responsible areas. (T-1).
         Allocation transfers from non-expendable to expendable CAT Codes require approval
         from Air Force Security Forces Center (AFSFC/SFXW) for ground munitions,
         AFCEC/CXD for Explosive Demolition materials, and AF/A5R-C for air-munitions
         and associated components. (T-1).
         7.4.2.4.5. The MUFM, MAJCOM/NAF munitions staff, and GACP work closely to
         ensure approved OOCRs do not cause unnecessary munitions movements. (T-1).
         Source and consolidate munitions movements using the most economical means
         possible. (T-1).
         7.4.2.4.6. If the MUFM with MAJCOM/NAF assistance cannot support an OOCR
         they will finalize, forward, or deny the OOCR in AMST. (T-1).
  7.4.3. Allocation Transfer Requests (ATR). ATRs are submitted to support Weapons
  Training Deployments, exercises, competitions, demonstrations, test, or training. After
  coordination with the MAJCOM/NAF MUFM, the MASO submits an ATR in the AMST
  FAM. (T-1). Process ATRs IAW the Air Force Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide
  posted on the AF MC2 SharePoint site and the following:
      7.4.3.1. Asset availability, rather than the transfer timeline, is the primary basis for
      determining whether munitions support can be provided by the host unit. MASOs and
      units will make every effort to support the transfer timeline.
      7.4.3.2. The losing MASO will ensure the unit has sufficient allocations to support
      exercise requirements and pass allocations to the supporting MASO not later than 60
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                      105


       calendar days in the Continental United States (CONUS) and 90 calendar days Outside
       Continental United States (OCONUS) before the exercise begins. (T-2).
       7.4.3.3. The losing/gaining MASOs will ensure the allocation transfer is processed in
       CAS IAW the Air Force Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide within 14 calendar
       days of the ATR date. (T-2). The gaining MASO and MAJCOM/NAF will notify the
       losing MASO and MAJCOM/NAF of supportability by updating AMST no later than 7
       calendar days after date of the ATR. (T-2).
       7.4.3.4. The gaining MASO has requisition (stock control) responsibility for all
       increased or transferred allocations provided the time requirements in paragraph 7.4.3.3
       are met. (T-1).
       7.4.3.5. Within 14 calendar days of event completion (e.g., exercise, test) the host unit
       will complete the After Action Report (AAR) on the GACP website using the original
       ATR number. (T-2).
       7.4.3.6. Within 7 calendar days of receiving the AAR the losing/gaining MASO will
       process allocations remaining from the event within CAS. (T-2).
   7.4.4. Stock Levels. Stock levels enable management of physical stock against allocations
   and positioning objectives. Levels are established in CAS as authorized by the DLAR and
   MAJCOM/NAF instructions. The MASO will:
       7.4.4.1. Validate and maintain stock levels in CAS IAW the DLAR and MAJCOM/NAF
       instructions and notifies custodians when their approved annual allocations are available
       in AMST. (T-1).
       7.4.4.2. Validate that new FY stock levels are accurately loaded in CAS. (T-1). Do not
       process new FY expenditures until the new FY levels have been validated. (T-1).
       7.4.4.3. Notify the GACP using the CRM of any host/user relationship or stock level
       allocation discrepancies. (T-1).
       7.4.4.4. Use the SAAR system through the GACP website for all non-MSRC managed
       assets. (T-1).
EXCEPTION: This does not apply to approved COTS or RDT&E which will be managed IAW
paragraphs 7.3.8 and 7.16.
   7.4.5. WRM Aircraft Munitions Levels. Munitions Supervision and MASOs will:
NOTE: This AFI takes precedence over AFI 25-101 for matters related to CAS processing,
munitions warehouse management, and accounting processes for munitions in CAS.
       7.4.5.1. Train personnel to manage all aspects of WRM levels throughout the munitions
       operational flow process. (T-2).
       7.4.5.2. Actively monitor WRM allocations and stock levels against on-hand stock
       balances to ensure WRM levels remain supportable. (T-1). Review current WRM levels
       against on-hand CAS balances using the Level Reconciliation Listing (AMC12A). (T-3).
       7.4.5.3. Communicate shortfalls and constraints with commanders, MAJCOM, NAF, and
       GACP. (T-1).
 106                                                                 AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


       7.4.5.4. Maintain built-up assets and components on the DoDAAC stock record account.
       (T-1). Do not designate stock assets as WRM or segregate from other stock assets prior
       to expenditure. (T-1). Once assets are expended, they are categorized as WRM (or
       another category) and a CAS expenditure is processed against the appropriate ORG/SHP
       code and CAT Code. (T-0).
       7.4.5.5. Munitions assets may be physically stored at Geographically Separated Units
       (GSU)/remote locations (e.g., another base, installation, or region) to support WRM
       requirements. In this case, account for assets on the DoDAAC stock record account
       assigned to the physical storage base/installation, or on a host DoDAAC stock record
       account if no DoDAAC is established. (T-1). If accounted for on a host DoDAAC, load
       storage structures, storage locations, and manage assets on the host DoDAAC stock
       record account. (T-1).
       7.4.5.6. WRM levels for CAT Code G and X may be provided by the MAJCOM/NAF
       via a WCDO. WRM levels for CAT Code F and T are provided by the MAJCOM/NAF
       via AMST. AF/A5R-C provides CAT Code Z (STAMP) allocations centrally.
       7.4.5.7. Load WRM air munitions levels for CAT Code G, X, and Z against ORG/SHP
       code 002WR. (T-1). Load WRM air munitions levels for CAT Code F and T against the
       appropriate squadron ORG/SHP code as reflected in AMST. (T-1).
NOTE: Allocations loaded against ORG/SHP code 002WR are positioning objectives only and
do not restrict munitions expenditure to support valid WRM, combat, or contingency operations.
   7.4.6. WRM Mobility, CAT Code B. The MASO manages WRM Mobility, CAT Code B
   munitions allocations and accounts as follows:
       7.4.6.1. Unless otherwise authorized in this AFI, manage CAT Code B munitions on the
       DoDAAC stock record account. (T-1). This increases logistics flexibility in support of
       various levels of effort, reduces inventories, management, and administrative tasks for
       accounts with little or no activity.
       7.4.6.2. Do not physically segregate CAT Code B allocated mobility munitions in base
       stock. (T-1). Units may utilize CAS location suffixes to enhance management as
       identified in the local Movement Control OI. (T-1).
       7.4.6.3. CAT Code B assets being deployed will either be shipped from DoDAAC stock
       record account to the deployed location DoDAAC for subsequent issue; or issued to
       custody accounts prior to deployment and managed from the home station custody
       account. (T-2).
          7.4.6.3.1. Except when authorized IAW paragraph 7.4.6.5, do not issue/release
          assets prior to receipt of execution or mobilization order or prior to coordination with
          the IDO.
EXCEPTION: During local exercises, physical assets may be broken out, staged, and processed
for deployment as “bulk-shipped” assets. Generate shipping documents using the CAS training
database.
          7.4.6.3.2. Ensure proper security and transfer documentation for these assets IAW
          paragraph 7.6.3.7 whether real-world or exercise.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                        107


      7.4.6.4. The MASO may submit ATRs to allocate the next higher QUP for mobility
      accounts. If the ATR is approved, units may ship CAT Code B mobility assets to the
      nearest QUP. EXAMPLE: The GMAT authorizes 90 rds, 27 rds are allocated IAW
      paragraph 14.2.4 (e.g., 90 rds x .30 = 27 rds). The MASO would submit an ATR to
      increase the allocation to 30 rds allowing deployment of 2 full clips (2 clips x 15 rds = 30
      rds).
      7.4.6.5. When an organization/functional user requests issue of CAT Code B allocated
      munitions before receipt of an execution/mobilization order, they must provide
      justification to the MASO and IDO. (T-2). The MASO advises the IDO on whether
      management of a separate custody account is justified by the need. (T-3). The IDO shall
      only consider issuing CAT Code B ammunition to custody accounts when:
          7.4.6.5.1. Mission circumstances dictate immediate access to munitions and local
          issue/shipment procedures cannot support required deployment timelines. (T-2).
          7.4.6.5.2. The unit/organization frequently deploys with munitions to locations with
          no established munitions DoDAAC. (T-2).
          7.4.6.5.3. Total quantities of wing allocations can support segregation of specific
          unit’s CAT Code B mobility munitions allocation. (T-2).
          7.4.6.5.4. Sufficient CAT Code B allocations are not pre-positioned at the deployed
          location.    The IDO and MASO coordinate with the gaining MASO or
          MAJCOM/NAF munitions staff to ensure assets are not already pre-positioned to
          support deployed munitions requirements. (T-2).
      7.4.6.6. When the IDO and MASO allows/approves custody account(s) for CAT Code B
      munitions:
          7.4.6.6.1. Limit custody accounts to one per separate residual force (i.e., PRIME
          BEEF, security forces, EOD, OSI, etc.). (T-2).
          7.4.6.6.2. Do not requisition replacements for assets deployed from home station. (T-
          2). Requisitions may be submitted after expenditures are validated and processed or
          shipments are processed removing assets from the DoDAAC stock account. (T-2).
   7.4.7. CAD/PAD TCI. Plans and schedules generated at the quarterly munitions and P&S
   meeting serve as the MASO’s authority to schedule and issue authorized TCI assets to the
   maintenance activity. Assets ordered beyond those planned and scheduled during the
   quarterly meeting must be coordinated between the MASO and P&S. (T-3).
      7.4.7.1. Limit on-hand CAD/PAD stock balances to one per MDS supported in case of
      inadvertent firings or maintenance defects. (T-1). Justify additional asset balances
      through the IM by SAAR. (T-1).
EXCEPTION: If an item has an AFTO Form 223 for scheduled maintenance, a SAAR is not
required to justify the consumption issue.
      7.4.7.2. MASOs may issue assets one calendar quarter ahead of their forecasted quarter
      without IM approval. For issue requests beyond the next calendar quarter, the using
      organization will coordinate the request with the IM. (T-2). This will be documented and
      provided to the MASO as justification to issue assets ahead of schedule. (T-2).
108                                                                   AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


      7.4.7.3. RDT&E and A&S programs will follow stock level guidance developed by
      AFMC/A4M. (T-1). The AFMC/A4M guidance applies to all agencies/activities
      supporting AFMC RDT&E and A&S activity regardless of host unit MAJCOM.
      7.4.7.4. TCI Extension Requests: Home station PS&D personnel request TCI extensions
      IAW AFI 21-101 and T.O. 00-20-1 for all aircraft. (T-1). The IM is authorized to direct
      inter-command redistribution of CAD/PAD parts as required without MAJCOM
      coordination.
      7.4.7.5. ICBM and Launch Facility TCI: Load stock levels for ordnance replacement
      assets IAW allocation levels approved by the CAD/PAD-JPO, AFLCMC/EBHJ, Hill
      AFB, UT.
      7.4.7.6. Transient C-5, C-17, KC-10, and KC-135 Strategic Airlift Hubs:
      Bases/installations supporting transient strategic aircraft may submit a SAAR to request
      authorization to keep one complete aircraft system load of TCI on hand for each MDS
      common to that base. This TCI stock supports unforeseen/inadvertent transient aircraft
      firing or unforeseen maintenance incurred while away from home station.
         7.4.7.6.1. When authorized and assets are on-hand to support transient aircraft,
         consumption issue time change items to an existing account using DIFM procedures
         IAW paragraph 7.10.2.3
         7.4.7.6.2. When assets are not on-hand, request lateral support through the GACP.
         7.4.7.6.3. The MASO requests disposition of serviceable excess CAD/PAD thru the
         GACP IAW paragraph 3.12.12.
  7.4.8. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE). (T-1).
      7.4.8.1. AFE Replacement Munitions (Time Change): Issue CAT Code A allocated AFE
      munitions using consumption issue and DIFM control procedures.
      7.4.8.2. AFE Munitions Initial Build-up: Issue CAT Code T allocated AFE munitions
      using consumption issue and non-DIFM control procedures. Issue CC-A and CC-C
      assets with sufficient time remaining to fill requirements in this CAT Code.
      7.4.8.3. AFE Training Munitions: Issue CAT Code D allocated AFE munitions using
      custody account procedures. (T-1). Do not consumption issue or use DIFM control
      procedures. (T-1). Issue CC-B or CC-C assets to fill these requirements before issuing
      CC-A assets.
      7.4.8.4. Tracking Installed AFE Munitions: Units issued AFE (consumption/custody)
      are responsible for tracking assets by item, lot number, and prescribed shelf/service life in
      the Automated Life Support Management System (ALSMS) or Automated Life-
      sustaining Equipment Record and Tracking System (ALERTS) according to AFI 11-301,
      Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program. AFE units follow CMRS Procedures IAW
      paragraph 7.2.5.
      7.4.8.5. AFE Aircraft Transfer Procedures: Losing units will initiate action to transfer
      assets/allocations to the gaining custody account. The gaining custody account custodian
      will ensure transferred (incoming) munitions are processed through the MASO.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                    109


   7.4.9. Non-expendable Airmunitions Training Items. Non-expendable airmunitions
   training items are allocated as CAT Code C, non-explosive training end-item munitions
   based on forecasts submitted by units, MAJCOMs, or MUFMs IAW paragraph 7.3.
      7.4.9.1. Availability of many training munitions are constrained limiting allocation and
      distribution. Not all forecasted non-expendable airmunitions training requirements will
      be satisfied.
      7.4.9.2. Munitions allocated to AETC Schoolhouse units and the 9 MUNS (AFCOMAC)
      will be carried in Condition Code (CC)-B in CAS and are intended for training use only.
      Use of 1500 series tags to identify CC-B student munitions is not required when
      supporting student training.
   7.4.10. COTS Levels. (T-1). The MASO will load CAT Code S stock levels in CAS for
   approved COTS munitions using a local “L” NSN provided by the GACP CMPM.
   EXAMPLE: 1375L12345600. The requesting unit will provide the MASO with copies of all
   COTS approval documents to support loading/adjusting CAS stock levels and validating
   purchase/use.
      7.4.10.1. CAS Management: Approved and locally procured COTS munitions will be
      managed on CAS accountable records. Otherwise, manage COTS using established
      procedures for stock-listed munitions. Units will not use the Non-accountable Program
      (AM101A).
EXCEPTION: AFMC/A4M shall develop, coordinate, and publish COTS guidance for AFMC
RDT&E agencies. AFMC/A4M guidance shall apply to all Air Force organizations that support
AFMC RDT&E activities regardless of host unit or MAJCOM.
          7.4.10.1.1. Units that locally purchase COTS munitions will turn in all COTS
          munitions to the MASO prior to use. (T-1). Units will ensure vendor/contractor
          ordered munitions have the delivery destination to the base munitions activity (FV
          account). (T-1).
          7.4.10.1.2. The MASO will pick-up COTS munitions on stock record and then issue
          COTS munitions to a valid unit custody account. (T-1).
      7.4.10.2. Unauthorized Use: COTS assets on-hand without approval will be reported to
      the GACP CMPM. (T-1). In this case, units will immediately discontinue use, and if
      COTS munitions are required, submit a COTS request and data package for approval
      IAW paragraph 7.3.8 (T-1). Approved COTS munitions maintained longer than one
      year from approval date must be revalidated annually. (T-1).
      7.4.10.3. COTS Disapproved for Munitions System Management: When approved
      COTS munitions are not approved for munitions system management, but have received
      NNMSB approval, the using unit accepts full “cradle-to-grave” responsibility IAW
      paragraph 3.12.11.2. (T-1).
      7.4.10.4. Local COTS Instructions. Units requiring and using COTS munitions will
      develop a written OI to address accountability, storage, handling, training, emergency
      procedures, and disposition of malfunctions (duds), residue, and excesses. (T-1).
      Additionally, using units shall publish local safety instructions IAW AFMAN 91-201. (T-
 110                                                                  AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


       1). Instructions will be approved through Munitions Supervision, Environmental Office,
       EOD, and Weapons/Explosive Safety Office prior to purchasing the munitions. (T-1).
       7.4.10.5. Disposal: COTS munitions will be disposed of IAW paragraph 3.12.8
       7.4.10.6. Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program. BASH program allocations are
       managed in the same manner as other COTS munitions.
       7.4.10.7. Air Force Shooting Program (AFSP) Munitions Management: Refer to AFI
       34-271, Air Force Shooting Program.
7.5. Managing Munitions from the DoDAAC Stock Record Account.
   7.5.1. Without specific approved exception, do not use custody accounts to manage SGO
   munitions assets (e.g., flightline, aircraft munitions), non-expendable airmunitions training
   assets, and other munitions assets used by the munitions squadron (MUNS)/munitions flight.
   (T-1). Manage these munitions assets, to include NWRM (airmunitions), from the DoDAAC
   stock account. (T-1). This includes assigned tenant flying units (e.g., Total Force Integration,
   Air Reserve Component (ARC)).
NOTE: Only issue non-expendable airmunitions training assets to custody accounts when used
by organizations external to the munitions unit.
EXCEPTION: Lead Commands may approve unit level custody account management
procedures in support of SGO only for the following: Non-traditional SOCOM and AFCENT
operations, helicopter support at Missile Wings, A&S programs, and RDT&E programs. In
these cases, units will manage the custody account IAW paragraph 7.11.
       7.5.1.1. Establish ORG/SHP code accounts to forecast and manage allocations/levels.
       7.5.1.2. Load authorized/approved levels against the ORG/SHP code for the account but
       do not issue assets. (T-1).
   7.5.2. When tenant flying units have a separate DoDAAC, allocation and accountability
   management IAW this AFI is the responsibility of the tenant unit. (T-1). If tenant flying
   units do not have a separate DoDAAC, any tenant unit munitions allocations are applied
   against the appropriate squadron ORG/SHP codes in CAS, and accountability and
   expenditure of the munitions assets is managed on stock record account by the unit owning
   the DoDAAC. (T-1).
   7.5.3. To the fullest extent possible, expend SGO assets by CR (if applicable) against the
   appropriate ORG/SHP code using near-real time CAS transaction processing (e.g.,
   automated-, direct-, or remote-input methods) IAW paragraph 7.1.1.3. (T-3).
   7.5.4. Assets allocated and managed on DoDAAC stock do not require physical segregation.
   The appropriate ORG/SHP code and CAT Code is assigned only at the point of expenditure.
   (T-1).
   7.5.5. When stock levels are not sufficient to support total wing allocations, the MASO must
   coordinate with wing operational planners (e.g., Operation Group Weapons and Tactics,
   IDO) to determine priority of support. (T-1).
   7.5.6. Munitions Supervision may utilize munitions maintenance and production facilities
   (e.g., build pads, maintenance bays, line-delivery) as stock storage locations to enable

  effective stock management in support of SGO. If used, ensure this practice meets AFMAN
  91-201 requirements. (T-0).
  7.5.7. An AF Form 68 is not required to satisfy/process flightline demands, munitions
  managed within the MSA, Small arms Ammunition Combat Consumption (SmACC) issues
  to ORG/SHP code 920CC, or for the single wing mobility account 002BP. Do not expend
  assets from ORG/SHP code 920CC or 002BP, these are not expenditure accounts. (T-1).
  7.5.8. DoDAAC Stock Inventories. There are three types of DoDAAC stock inventories.
  The Annual, Semi-annual, and Perpetual Inventory; Monthly 10-percent Inventory; and the
  Change of MASO inventory. These inventories validate the physical inventory control
  process and accuracy of accountable records by reconciling NSN, quantity, lot number, CC,
  and location. Additionally, these inventories ensure materiel accountability is properly
  executed IAW DoDI 5000.64, Accountability and Management of DoD Equipment and
  Other Accountable Property and DoD 5100.76-M. The MASO ensures DoDAAC stock
  inventories are conducted as follows:
     7.5.8.1. The results of all DoDAAC stock inventories will be documented on an
     inventory results memorandum. (T-1). Inventory results will be briefed to and the
     memorandum will be signed by the Unit Commander over the DoDAAC stock account;
     and submitted back to the MASO within 15 calendar days of receipt. (T-1). For contract
     munitions organizations, the ACO or Functional Commander will sign the inventory
     results memorandum. (T-1). All inventory results memorandums will include the
     following areas. (T-1):
         7.5.8.1.1. Compliance with established procedures.
         7.5.8.1.2. Custody account record accuracy.

         7.5.8.1.3. Inventory control.
         7.5.8.1.4. Proper storage procedures.
         7.5.8.1.5. Adherence to safety and security criteria.
     7.5.8.2. The account or specific assets being inventoried will be frozen before
     conducting physical counts. (T-1).
     7.5.8.3. The MASO ensures munitions users are aware of inventory dates by publishing
     them in available base media such as bulletins, e-mail to customers, or SharePoint sites.
     (T-3).
     7.5.8.4. Inventories will be performed and recorded utilizing only CAS generated or
     manual inventory count sheets. (T-1).
     7.5.8.5. During inventories, minimize account transactions by only processing
     emergency requests submitted in writing and approved by the group commander (or
     equivalent). (T-3).

          7.5.8.7.3. NWRM: All CAS-managed NWRM assets (stock and custody) will be
          inventoried during March and September. (T-0).
              7.5.8.7.3.1. Utilize semi-annual DoDAAC inventory procedures found in AFI 20-
              110 and this publication. (T-0).
              7.5.8.7.3.2. If any NWRM asset is found to be without a manufacturer assigned
              S/N, report the condition to the IM via the GACP CRM. The IM and ES will
              coordinate to provide the MASO an appropriate pseudo S/N. (T-0).
          7.5.8.7.4. Only open containers, to including “LITE” boxes, when:
              7.5.8.7.4.1. Evidence of pilferage or forced entry exists. (T-0).

          7.5.8.7.5. Annual, Semi-annual, and Perpetual Inventory:
              7.5.8.7.5.1. Annual Inventory: Except for NWRM, assets stored at collocated
              operating bases, remote/alternate storage locations, and in depot accounts, may
              conduct one complete annual wall-to-wall inventory in either March or
              September. (T-0).
              7.5.8.7.5.2. Semi-annual Inventory: Initiate and conduct semi-annual inventories
              in March and September. (T-2).
EXCEPTION: At deployed locations only, the most recent change of MASO inventory may be
used to satisfy the semi-annual inventory requirement when no more than 180 calendar days
have elapsed between any combination of semi-annual and change of MASO inventories.
              7.5.8.7.5.3. Perpetual Inventory: A perpetual inventory is any method that results
              in counting the entire munitions inventory three times a year. Depot accounts will
              count the entire munitions inventory twice a year. (T-1).
                 7.5.8.7.5.3.1. The perpetual inventory may be accomplished in place of and
                 as a substitute for the annual and/or semi-annual DoDAAC stock inventory.
                 (T-2). EXAMPLE: Inventory 25-percent of the DoDAAC stock monthly
                 (25-percent per month x 12 months = 3 complete inventories).
                 7.5.8.7.5.3.2. Do not include CAS-managed NWRM assets, custody account
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                      113


                 assets, and non-accountable courtesy storage assets in the perpetual inventory.
                 (T-2). These assets will be inventoried as prescribed in Semi-annual and
                 custody account inventories (if applicable). (T-2).
              7.5.8.7.5.4. Units conducting semi-annual or perpetual inventories will reconcile
              and validate the following items at least semi-annually in March and September;
              or annually, in March for depot accounts: (T-1).
                 7.5.8.7.5.4.1. All outstanding AWM/AWP workorders against the CC-E and
                 CC-G assets that the workorders are assigned to. (T-1).

                 7.5.8.7.5.4.3. CAS and TMRS records by NSN, quantity, and CC. (T-1). Use
                 the Asset Balance Report (AM501A) along with TMRS Database Records
                 Count for AURs and Unassembled Components Reports by NSN. (T-1).
                 Document differences to record balances and CCs. (T-1). Submit validated
                 TMRS or CAS listings to munitions supervision for review prior to filing by
                 the MASO. (T-1).
NOTE: A missing Materiel Management Aggregation Code (MMAC) on an NSN in
TMRS is not considered a reconciliation error, but should be reported to the RAM
Program Office for update in the next TMRS autoload.
                 7.5.8.7.5.4.4. CAT Code S container levels for containers maintained on
                 stock. (T-2).
          7.5.8.7.6. Monthly 10-percent Inventory: This inventory identifies negative trends
          between annual/semi-annual DoDAAC stock inventories and to ensure all assets are
          inventoried annually.
              7.5.8.7.6.1. Exclude custody accounts, courtesy storage, and assets stored at
              collocated operating bases and remote sites/alternate storage locations. (T-2).
              7.5.8.7.6.2. Monthly 10-percent inventories are not required when utilizing a
              perpetual inventory cycle. (T-3).
              7.5.8.7.6.3. Except during months when a 100-percent DoDAAC stock inventory
              is conducted (March and September), conduct a 10-percent monthly inventory of
              the DoDAAC stock record account (to include depot accounts). (T-1).
                 7.5.8.7.6.3.1. Conduct Monthly 10-percent inventories by NSN or by facility.
                 (T-1). Inventories performed by facility will be considered a 10-percent, and
                 will be treated as such, even though CAS will identify them as “Special”. (T-
                 1).
                 7.5.8.7.6.3.2. Validate AWM/AWP records/status for all NSNs selected for
                 the 10-percent inventory. (T-2).
          7.5.8.7.7. Change of MASO Inventory: This inventory enables the outgoing and
          incoming MASO to jointly review and validate results of the physical inventory of
          the DoDAAC stock account. This inventory excludes custody account and courtesy
          stored assets.
 114                                                                   AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


          7.5.8.7.8. Sealed Structure Inventories: Sealed structures (to include sealed ISO
          containers) not opened since the last inventory, are not required to be opened for
          semi-annual, monthly 10-percent, or change of MASO inventories. (T-3). Inventory
          of sealed structures is at the discretion of the current MASO or on-coming MASO.
          (T-3).
          7.5.8.7.9. APF Inventories: Inventories of APF ISO containers is only required when
          they are being opened for inspection and during reconstitution. (T-3). Verification of
          structure seals is required during 10-percents that affect stored APF assets and all
          semi-annual and change of MASO inventories. (T-1). A physical inventory will not
          be conducted at the time of transfer of the APF account. (T-2).
          7.5.8.7.10. Clearing DoDAAC Stock Inventories:
             7.5.8.7.10.1. Process all required transactions (inventory counts, recounts, IADs,
             etc.) to clear all annual, semi-annual, and perpetual DoDAAC stock inventories in
             CAS by the last day of the month in which the inventory is conducted. (T-1).
             7.5.8.7.10.2. Process all required transactions (inventory counts, recounts, IADs,
             etc.) to clear 10-percent and change of MASO inventories in CAS within 30
             calendar days of inventory start (freeze) date. (T-1).
NOTE: Change of MASO inventories may not align to a specific month and may be filed
beyond the end of the month that the inventory began.
             7.5.8.7.10.3. When processing inventories, assets location changes (e.g.,
             movements) will not be updated as part of the Inventory Process (AM427A)
             unless a “total” physical balance discrepancy. (T-1).
NOTE: This avoids incorrect Net Explosive Weight Quantity Distance (NEWQD) updates and
ensures creation of a CAS transaction audit trail for all movement “from/to” locations.
             7.5.8.7.10.4. Movements processed using the CAS Movement Process
             (AM104A) to correct asset locations when no overall balance discrepancy exists
             does not require an IAD package. (T-2).
             7.5.8.7.10.5. Administrative or supporting documents (e.g., inventory packages)
             may be filed beyond the end of the inventory month when additional research of
             accountable inventory discrepancies delays inventory completion. (T-1).
       7.5.8.8. DoDAAC Stock Inventory Discrepancies:
          7.5.8.8.1. Document all DoDAAC stock inventory discrepancies on the inventory
          results memorandum IAW paragraph 7.5.8.1 (T-0). Additionally, brief the MUNS
          Supt/Munitions Flight Chief and Squadron Commander on the inventory results. (T-
          1). Contract munitions organizations will also brief inventory discrepancies and
          corrective actions to the QAE and the Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO). (T-
          1).
          7.5.8.8.2. If a munitions item cannot be initially accounted for (either gain or loss), or
          is not in the reported/documented location, immediately notify the MASO, conduct
          an initial physical search for the asset, and research the asset’s transaction history. (T-
          0). If these actions do not locate the asset, do not determine the reason for the
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                         115


           overage, or do not identify a legitimate explanation for the gain or loss (e.g., short
           shipment, over shipment, erroneous or unprocessed transaction), the MASO may be
           required to report the gain or loss to the Security Forces or Air Force Office of
           Special Investigations (OSI). (T-1). Refer to DoD 5100.76-M, Enclosure 11, Reports,
           Investigative Aids, and Disposition of Records for reporting criteria and timelines. (T-
           0).
           7.5.8.8.3. Report AA&E that is lost, missing, stolen, or recovered IAW DoD
           5100.76-M and AFI 31-101. (T-0). Additionally, report all NWRM discrepancies
           IAW AFI 20-110. (T-0).
NOTE: IAW AFI AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, a potential
compromise of classified information occurs when an investigating official concludes that a
compromise of classified information has more than likely occurred as a result of a security
incident.
           7.5.8.8.4. Forward stockpile discrepancies found during the inventory (e.g., broken
           metal banding, illegible markings, ballooned barrier bags, damaged containers) to the
           Materiel and Production Section/Flight Chief for resolution. (T-2).
7.6. Deployed Munitions Management. (T-1)
   7.6.1. Expendable Aircraft Munitions. When a unit moves munitions via tactical ferry to a
   deployed location with an established DoDAAC, each deployed location will transfer assets
   using the “Import” option in the CAS Expeditor Management (AM2W1A) program. This
   process transfers the assets loaded on the specific aircraft from home station to the gaining
   DoDAAC as stock assets. WSN records are also transferred retaining the original WSN.
NOTE: Bulk assets will still be transferred utilizing the shipping/receiving method.
       7.6.1.1. If the assets were assigned to a custody account, the assets must be returned to
       stock then transferred to the gaining location as stock assets.
       7.6.1.2. Expenditures during In-transit: The MASO at the receiving location (gaining
       MASO) will ensure that a validation is conducted to verify quantity of assets received
       and expended. Expend the appropriate quantity against the ORG/SHP code as identified
       in paragraph 7.11.3.5.
   7.6.2. Mobility Air Forces (MAF) Staged/Deployed WRM Countermeasures. Tactical
   Control (TACON) and non-TACON:
       7.6.2.1. Accountability for C-5/C-17 WRM countermeasures remain with the home
       station MASO until resupply is required when these aircraft are staged at OCONUS
       locations.
       7.6.2.2. Countermeasures loaded on staged C-5/C-17 aircraft that require resupply will
       be imported at the time of download IAW paragraph 7.6.1. Run a CAS ad hoc report
       using the “Containers Table” to identify both the owning DoDAAC and current CAS
       maintaining DoDAAC. The receiving location will coordinate with the losing location to
       obtain service life data.
       7.6.2.3. The aircraft container and associated munitions will only be imported by another
       DoDAAC when resupply is needed or when the staged aircraft returns to home station.
116                                                                  AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


      Every effort will be made to ensure the Chaff-Flare Magazine Container is loaded on one
      of the owning DoDAAC tails to ensure SPRAM accountability.
      7.6.2.4. Accountability for C-130 WRM countermeasures will be managed at the
      deployed location MASO when aircraft are deployed to OCONUS locations. The
      deployed DoDAAC will import WRM countermeasures IAW paragraph 7.6.1. The
      deployed location will coordinate with the originating location to obtain service life data.
      The following is not authorized:
         7.6.2.4.1. Cross-loading of countermeasures from deploying or redeploying aircraft.
         7.6.2.4.2. Holding countermeasures from a deployed aircraft for loading during
         redeployment.
  7.6.3. Non-expendable Training Munitions. Accountability and allocations of deployed
  non-expendable training munitions (e.g., captive missiles, argon bottles, AMAs) will be
  transferred to the deployed DoDAAC. (T-1).
      7.6.3.1. Follow the deployed location’s MAJCOM, theater, and installation/base
      guidance or procedures written in command/base supplements, deployment orders, or
      other reporting instructions that specify management and control of munitions assets at
      deployed locations.
      7.6.3.2. Communication between the deployed location MASO and home station MASO
      is essential to the allocation transfer process. The MASO shall validate deployment
      requirements, and ensure physical management, security, safety, and accountability of
      munitions upon arrival and throughout the deployment.
      7.6.3.3. Only deploy essential non-expendable training munitions. Prior to deployment,
      home station munitions supervision shall coordinate with deployed location munitions
      supervision to validate availability of in-place training munitions for use by the deployed
      unit.
      7.6.3.4. Deployed to Established DoDAAC: When deploying non-expendable training
      munitions to an established DoDAAC, the following procedures will be used:
         7.6.3.4.1. When non-expendable munitions assets are tactical ferried and transferred
         using the “Import” option in the CAS Expeditor Management (AM2W1A) program,
         the home station MASO will ensure an ATR is submitted IAW paragraph 7.4.3.
         7.6.3.4.2. Maintenance records and documentation for deployed CATM assets (i.e.,
         TMRS) may be maintained and managed at the deployed location.
         7.6.3.4.3. The home station munitions supervision will ensure TMRS records are
         electronically transferred to the deployed location. Munitions supervision at the
         deployed location will ensure records are maintained (e.g., TMRS) during the
         deployment and electronically transferred back to the home station upon
         redeployment.
         7.6.3.4.4. The deployed unit is responsible to ensure all non-expendable training
         munitions return to home station upon redeployment.
      7.6.3.4.5. Deployed to No Established DoDAAC: When deploying non-expendable
      training munitions to a location with no established DoDAAC, manage assets from home
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                      117


     station until a DoDAAC is established or the deployed location’s MAJCOM or theater
     managers provide specific instructions.
  7.6.4. Deployment of Custody Account Assets. If custodians require shipment of assets
  via the transportation activity to an established DoDAAC, assets will be turned in to the
  MSA and appropriate shipment documents processed. Shipment documents must be
  forwarded to the gaining MASO.
     7.6.4.1. If shipment is to a location with no established DoDAAC, contact
     MAJCOM/NAF munitions staff, which will coordinate with the MAJCOM/NAF with
     operational oversight of the deployment location to establish a DoDAAC IAW
     paragraph 9.2 or designate an existing DoDAAC to provide MASO oversight.
     7.6.4.2. Instead of shipment, the MASO may request MAJCOM/NAF (or equivalent)
     approval to retain deployed assets on custodial account. OSI, Para Rescue, AFE, or other
     missions that support frequent operations/training missions shorter than 30 calendar days
     may maintain assets on home station Custody Account.
     7.6.4.3. If custodians ship munitions using mobility channels, the MASO must turn-in
     and ship assets. Shipment documents will be forwarded to the gaining MASO at the
     DoDAAC designated by the NAF or Lead Command with operational oversight.
     7.6.4.4. The IDO or deployed commander will designate a responsible individual to be
     the munitions courier. The individual will be responsible for maintaining accountability
     of assets until they are turned in to the home-station or deployed MASO.
     7.6.4.5. Munitions requested in support of contingency tasking without a custody
     account should be the exception and not the standard operating procedure. In this case,
     deploying members must furnish a copy of their orders or other official communication
     (i.e., official e-mail or memorandum signed by IDO) stating member must deploy with
     ammunition. (T-2). Establish a custody account as applicable and process IAW
     paragraph 7.6.4 (T-1).
     7.6.4.6. If personnel must hand-carry weapons and munitions, the following procedures
     must be used:
         7.6.4.6.1. The MASO must process turn-in (if required)/shipment (PTO) to
         applicable DoDAAC, if known. A copy of the shipment document will be forwarded
         to the gaining MASO at the DoDAAC designated by MAJCOM/NAF with
         operational oversight. The MAJCOM/NAF will establish a DoDAAC IAW
         paragraph 9.2 or designate an existing DoDAAC to provide MASO oversight.
            7.6.4.6.1.1. Provide a copy of the shipment document to deploying individual.
            7.6.4.6.1.2. The following statement will be on the back of the shipment
            document and briefed to the member: “Small arms ammunition will be controlled
            and the person receiving the munitions must maintain accountability and lot
            number integrity for these assets. The shipping document and munitions will be
            turned in to the Air Force munitions storage area at the deployed location. If a
            storage area has not been established, member will retain accountability for these
            assets. Member will document on the back of the shipment document if assets are
            expended or turned over to any other military storage area (Army, Navy, etc.). If
 118                                                                  AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


              turned over to a military authority, member will receive documentation showing
              who accepted accountability for the assets to include: Name, rank, organization,
              and home base DSN (Do not use SSN). This documentation will be given to the
              home station MASO upon return from deployment.”
       7.6.4.7. Once munitions have been shipped units must contact the MAJCOM/NAF for
       replacement procedures.
7.7. Base Level Requisition Management. (T-1). The requisitioning process is the method
used to satisfy munitions requirements and obtain allocated munitions for use during the FY.
These include stock level objectives; DLAR and TAMP; AWP; Unsatisfactory Report (UR)
/Deficiency Report (DR) for CAS-managed NWRM assets; and/or approved ATR or OOCR.
   7.7.1. GAP Working Group. Determines call forward levels when positioning objectives
   are completed and recorded in the DLAR. Positioning objectives do not include projected
   expenditures or deliveries. Asset availability is defined as assets in the current AF inventory.
   7.7.2. Requisitioning Guidance. The GACP, AFNWC (for NWRM TYPE Trainers), and
   SPOs provide coordinated requisitioning guidance and direct OCONUS WRM munitions
   movements in coordination with the MAJCOM munitions staffs.
NOTE: Refer to Chapter 11 for contingency sourcing guidance.
   7.7.3. Processing and Supporting Requisitions. Submit and manage requisitions IAW
   GACP, AFNWC, and SPO coordinated guidance and this AFI. Prior to processing or
   supporting requisitions, ensure:
       7.7.3.1. Required technical data and storage capacity is available.
       7.7.3.2. An allocation exists for the assets and requisitioned quantities do not exceed the
       allocation:
EXCEPTION: When ordering by QUP or quantity per shipping container approved allocation
(stock levels) may be exceeded.
          7.7.3.2.1. Requisitioned quantities consider current on-hand balances, validated due-
          ins, projected current FY expenditures, and approved ATR/OOCR. EXAMPLE: A
          unit allocated 1,000 each, has 900 each on-hand, and requisitions 100, however,
          usage rates do not support the need for 100 more.
          7.7.3.2.2. Detailed justification is provided in the CAS requisition “Remarks” field to
          support unique or specific requirements or when past expenditure history does not
          support the request.
          7.7.3.2.3. Requisitions in support of the annual DLAR include the applicable FY that
          the DLAR applies to in “Comments” field of the CAS requisition. EXAMPLE:
          “FYXX alloc”.
       7.7.3.3. The proper Project Codes and requisitioning priorities are used. Requisitioning
       priorities are established in Table 7.2, Requisitioning Priorities. PACER AMMO project
       codes are identified in Table 7.4, PACER AMMO Project Codes.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                         119


   7.7.4. MICAP Requisitions (RDD 999). MICAPs are authorized only when lack of an
   asset will cause grounding of a MICAP reportable end item IAW the SRD found in T.O. 00-
   20-2.
       7.7.4.1. Submit MICAP requisitions in CAS. If CAS is unavailable, submit requisitions
       IAW DLM 4000.25-1, Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures
       (MILSTRIP) and GACP or MAJCOM guidance using the “MICAP” link on the GACP
       CRM.
       7.7.4.2. Units with MICAP requisitions will contact the GACP via the CRM and by
       telephone as soon as possible after submitting a MICAP requisition in CAS (see Chapter
       1 for GACP contact info).
       7.7.4.3. The GACP will work directly with the IM and the designated shipping activity
       to facilitate the quickest MICAP processing to the requesting unit. Provide the IM and
       shipping activity with supporting justification, such as aircraft ground date, intra-theater
       support options, and any related communications.
       7.7.4.4. Due to commercial transportation constraints at Hill AFB, on the last duty day of
       the week, field units must make every effort to submit and notify the GACP of MICAP
       requisitions NLT 0900 Mountain Time to allow MICAP shipments to be shipped by 1200
       that day. If delivery is to be made on a non-duty day (Saturday), the receiving unit must
       provide the specific recipients name and phone number. MICAP requests received
       during non-duty days will be processed and shipped the next duty day.
   7.7.5. Requisition Follow-Up Support. The GACP will contact the requesting unit when
   additional information/clarification is needed for a requisition. Munitions Operations
   personnel contact the GACP via the CRM for requisition follow-up support. Units shall
   utilize all available requisition follow-up/research tools prior to contacting the GACP.
NOTE: The AFMC Tracker located on the AF Portal provides integrated logistics query tools
that can be used to monitor and reconcile requisitions.
       7.7.5.1. Units will monitor requisitions weekly using the CAS Requisition Status Report,
       IGC, and the AFMC Tracker. Additionally, reconcile requisitions to satisfy AWP
       actions with the Munitions Scheduling weekly.
       7.7.5.2. Sourced Requisitions: Follow-up monthly with the Ship from DoDAAC. For
       requisitions sourced to depots or DoDAAC FV2172, follow-up through the GACP via the
       CRM no earlier than 2-weeks prior to the RDD.
       7.7.5.3. New/Pending Requisitions: Contact the GACP via the CRM to validate/update
       status when in new/pending status for more than 14 calendar days.
       7.7.5.4. Backordered Requisitions: Contact the GACP via the CRM after the Estimated
       Release Date (ERD) has passed. The ERD can be found in the CAS Detailed Backorder
       Listing (AMI22A). For CAD/PAD assets not available prior to required installation date,
       coordinate with P&S to submit shelf/service life extensions to the applicable IM.
       7.7.5.5. The GACP is authorized to approve, disapprove, cancel/change requisitions
       based on changing/ competing priorities, trend analysis and/or unit input, transportation
       constraints, or worldwide (or theater) availability/shortages of assets when not
       economically feasible to ship (e.g., small quantities).
 120                                                                   AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


       7.7.5.6. When canceling a sourced requisition or unsatisfied RDO, the GACP will notify
       the unit by entering rationale in the CAS requisition “Remarks” field.
       7.7.5.7. When an ALC IM suspects an abuse of the priority system, the IM or PM should
       contact the GACP to validate the priority. The ALC IM or PM will not change a
       requisition priority without contacting the GACP to validate the priority.

   7.7.6. NWRM. An approved allocation in CAS constitutes verification of a requisition.
   Verification of NWRM requisitions is accomplished through the annual forecasting and
   allocation process via AMST and CAS.
       7.7.6.1. Manual release of NWRM requisitions is not required when
       organizations/DoDAACs with an approved allocation for an NWRM asset is loaded in
       CAS. In this case, DoDAACs are authorized to requisition up to the allocated
       level/quantity.
       7.7.6.2. NWRM requisitions will not be increased up to QUP. Only requisition up to the
       approved allocated quantity.

       due-ins, projected current FY issues/expenditures, and approved ATR/OOCR.
   7.7.7. WRM. OCONUS units will not requisition (call forward) WRM assets. WRM call
   forward assets will be planned and coordinated based upon available transportation, funding,
   and storage availability.
   7.7.8. Missiles. Units will not requisition AUR missiles to include Captive Air Training
   Missiles (CATM). (T-1). Missile allocations are centrally controlled by HAF and published
   in the DLAR, TAMP, MMP, and AMST. The GACP (Robins AFB) distributes available
   AUR missiles based on approved allocations in coordination with the MAJCOMs and NAFs.
       7.7.8.1. When a unit falls below allocated levels, submit a CRM on the GACP website to
       request shipment/shortfall status. (T-2). Perform monthly follow-ups until status
       notification is received or shortfall is resolved. (T-2).
       7.7.8.2. Units may requisition the Missile Body Section (MBS) and Guidance Control
       Section (GCS), as required, to build-up a CATM. If ordered, the following remarks will
       be placed in the requisition 'Comments' field: FYXX Alloc CATM New Build. (T-1).
       7.7.8.3. If on-hand quantity of serviceable GCSs is less than the allocated AUR and
       CATM quantity, requisition replacement GCSs based on the number of unserviceable
       GCSs shipped to depot or manufacturer using priority 02. Unserviceable assets will be
       auto-shipped (CC-F) back to the depot. (T-1). Place the quantity of shipped GCSs,
 122                                                                 AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014

NOTE: Units failing to include required data may receive a denial status code of ‘CA’ with
reason for rejection.
   7.7.9. TCI (CAD/PAD) Requisitioning.
       7.7.9.1. Munitions organizations will meet quarterly with Maintenance Operations
       Flight, P&S, AFE, and the Flight Service Center (FSC) to determine MASO
       requisitioning requirements for the next nine month period by Mission Design Series
       (MDS), by tail number, and/or next higher assembly by S/N.
          7.7.9.1.1. During the quarterly Munitions, P&S, and FSC meeting, TCI requirements
          for aircraft scheduled for depot maintenance shall be identified to include
          requirements for items that will be changed out at field level and those that will be
          shipped from the field to support TCI requirements during depot maintenance. P&S
          will identify those items that will be requisitioned by the depot maintenance activity.
          7.7.9.1.2. When the depot maintenance activity requisitions time change replacement
          parts for aircraft in or during depot maintenance, field activities will not requisition
          these parts.
       7.7.9.2. To facilitate quarterly requisitioning, P&S will submit the quarterly validated
       time-change AFTO Form 223, Spreadsheet, or IMDS/G081 generated forecast to the
       MASO between 45 and 60 calendar days (CONUS) or between 90 and 120 calendar days
       (OCONUS) before the next calendar year quarter IAW Table 7.3, OCONUS and CONUS
       Time Change Requisitioning Schedule.
       7.7.9.3. The MASO will consolidate wing TCI requirements validated by P&S at
       quarterly meetings. The MASO and P&S will work to resolve any conflicts with
       consolidated requisitions (dates, quantities, P/Ns, etc.) prior to the MASO submitting
       requisitions to the GACP. When quarterly requisitions exceed forecasted requirements,
       do not submit supplemental forecasts.
       7.7.9.4. The MASO submits quarterly consolidated requisitions, based on the quarterly
       maintenance meeting through CAS. List the applicable tail numbers in the remarks field
       of the CAS requisition. Submit requisitions with sufficient time to allow for surface
       movement to allow assets to be available in time for any scheduled maintenance. Prior to
       submitting requisitions, refer to Table 7.2 for requisitioning priorities and RDD timelines
       and Table 7.3 for the OCONUS and CONUS time change requisition schedule.
          7.7.9.4.1. The quarterly consolidated requisition determines the authorized stock
          level to be loaded in CAS.

7.8. Custody Account Management. NOTE:                 Custody account management includes
procedures to manage consumption issued assets.
   7.8.1. Responsibilities. (T-1).
      7.8.1.1. Commanders/Civil Service (GS/GM) Division Heads (or equivalent): For units
      that “use” or “possess” munitions, ensures proper operation and custody of munitions
      issued to the unit’s custody accounts. Additionally, they will:
            7.8.1.1.1. Sign and ensure compliance with requirements of the AF Form 68,
            Munitions Authorization Record IAW paragraph 7.8.2, references in the Munitions
            Customer Information Matrix in Attachment 4, and local MASO requirements.
            7.8.1.1.2. Commanders/Civilian Division Heads (or equivalent) or their delegates
            may elect to personally receipt for and manage account munitions, or appoint account
            custodians to execute custody duties. Unit’s will develop and publish written internal
            management controls to ensure oversight and compliance with munitions custody
            account responsibilities.
            7.8.1.1.3. Ensure that contractors do not sign the AF Form 68 as an approver or to
            appoint munitions custodians. In contracted operations, a military officer holding
            command authority or Federal civilian (GS/GM) Division heads/chief will sign the
            AF Form 68.
            7.8.1.1.4. When they deem necessary, delegate their authority by memorandum to
            personnel with operational responsibility to sign munitions account documentation.
            A copy of the signed delegation memorandum will be provided to the MASO before
            account documentation will be accepted from the delegate.
               7.8.1.1.4.1. Delegated personnel must be an officer, senior NCO, or civilian (GS-
               9 or above). Delegated personnel may act on the commander’s behalf to sign the

              commander would normally sign. Delegated personnel must sign the AF Form
              68, or an addendum to the current AF Form 68 to acknowledge being briefed and
              trained on their and the Commander’s responsibilities. Delegated personnel will
              not also be a custodian on any unit custody account.
              7.8.1.1.4.2. Delegation of authority does not release the Commanders/Civilian
              division heads/chiefs from pecuniary liability. They remain responsible for
              overall custody account management.
              7.8.1.1.4.3. The delegation memorandum must be signed by the appropriate
              Commander or Civil Service Division Head/Chief. Vice and deputy signatures

       addendum) regardless of administrative alignment.
       7.8.2.5. Individuals cannot be added to the AF Form 68 once approved by the MASO.
       All custodians are considered “primary”. There are no alternate munitions account
       custodians.
       7.8.2.6. To add additional custodians, accomplish a new AF Form 68 or process an
       “Addendum” AF Form 68. If an addendum is used, mark it as “Addendum” and file it
       with the original.
       7.8.2.7. To withdraw a custodian’s authorization for any reason, the unit
       Commander/Civilian Division Head (or equivalent), delegate, or account custodian (as
       appropriate) will take one of the following actions within 24-hours:

          ensure the personnel are “red lined” from the AF Form 68 using the “typewriter” tool
          in Adobe Acrobat Professional © and the revised AF Form 68 is filed IAW the AF
          Munitions Document Control Procedures at Attachment 6. Munitions Operations
          will e-mail a copy to all remaining account custodians.
       7.8.2.8. The unit will revalidate the AF Form 68 annually. If there are no changes the
       unit Commander/Civilian Division Head (or equivalent), delegate, or account custodian
       enters a legible name and date in Part III of the AF Form 68 in the area titled “UNIT
       REVALIDATION: NAME AND DATE:” If there are no changes, the unit is not
       required to submit the revalidated AF Form 68 to the MASO.
NOTE: Munitions Operations does not validate the unit’s AF Form 68.
       7.8.2.9. The Munitions Operations element files and maintains AF Form 68s IAW

         on-hand balances during an inventory or while accomplishing day-to-day operations.
         In either case, these discrepancies must be thoroughly investigated to determine the
         cause. (T-0).
         7.8.4.8.3. If the discrepancy involves only lot numbers or CCs, the Munitions
         Inspection element will verify the correct information, and an AFTO Form 102,
         Munitions Inspection Document or CAS equivalent will be used as the source
         document for correcting accountable records. (T-1).
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                     129


         7.8.4.8.4. If the discrepancy involves loss/gain of munitions or explosives, validate
         the accuracy of the latest inventory data by performing recounts of all locations as
         necessary. (T-1).
            7.8.4.8.4.1. Correct known warehouse location errors. (T-1).
            7.8.4.8.4.2. Search base stock, munitions receiving, operating, and custody

            7.8.4.8.4.3. If missing assets are not located during the initial search, the
            responsible custodian will immediately conduct a physical search for the asset and
            contact the Munitions Operations element to assist in validating the past
            transaction history. (T-1). Review the transaction history to determine if a
            transaction posting error caused the out-of-balance condition. (T-1). Transaction
            histories may also help suggest alternative locations to search.
                7.8.4.8.4.3.1. Validate post-post transactions that were processed prior to the
                inventory or discrepancy. (T-1).
                7.8.4.8.4.3.2. Validate with the receiving units to determine if recent

                7.8.4.8.4.3.4. Validate the assets were not part of a recent build-up of a CR
                munition. (T-1).
            7.8.4.8.4.4. If a physical excess is caused by an erroneous expenditure transaction
            in CAS, RVP the transaction, if possible. (T-1). If it is not possible to RVP the
            transaction (e.g., previous FY, prior to previous cleared inventory), then process
            an IAD IAW paragraph 7.14. (T-0). Attach a copy of the expenditure source
            document as supporting documentation. (T-0).
            7.8.4.8.4.5. If the above actions do not account for the asset, notify the MASO.
            (T-1). The MASO may direct a Special inventory, or conduct additional
            transaction history research. (T-2). If these actions still do not account for the
            asset or identify the reason for the discrepancy, the responsible commander or
            designated representative must determine if the loss meets the reporting criteria
            outlined in DoD 5100.76-M. (T-0). If assets meet these criteria, the responsible
            commander or designated representative will report AA&E that is lost, missing,
            stolen, or recovered IAW DoD 5100.76-M and AFI 31-101. (T-0).
  7.8.5. Account Deficiencies. (T-1). When the MASO determines that a custody account is
  not being managed or maintained properly IAW this instruction, the MASO will initiate the
  following procedures:
     7.8.5.1. Notify the organizational commander in writing and allot 15 calendar days to
     correct deficiencies. (T-1).
 130                                                                 AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


       7.8.5.2. If discrepancies are not corrected within 15 calendar days after notification, the
       MASO must “freeze” the account and no further transactions will be processed until
       corrected. (T-1).
       7.8.5.3. The MASO must “unfreeze” the account when identified discrepancies have
       been corrected or may direct assets be turned in. (T-1). If discrepancies are not corrected
       within 30 calendar days after notification, the using organization’s group commander or
       equivalent will be notified through appropriate channels for assistance. (T-1).
   7.8.6. Account Closure: (T-1).
       7.8.6.1. The unit Commander determines when a custody account is no longer required
       to support the unit’s training or operational mission. The Commander requests the
       MASO close the custody account by submitting and email with justification to the
       MASO who will direct closure of the account and forward the results to the MUFM.
       7.8.6.2. Custodians will package all assets for custody turn-in using the original packing
       material. If original packing material is not available, contact the Munitions Flight for
       packing material or guidance on otherwise technically suitable packing material.
       7.8.6.3. No munitions transactions will take place until all documentation has been
       received by Munitions Operations.
7.9. Receiving Munitions.
   7.9.1. General Receipt Procedures. (T-0). Assets are in-checked and receiving inspections
   (RI) performed IAW T.O. 11A-1-10. In combat situations, receiving inspections may be
   conducted as part of the assembly/ production process. Non-explosive NWRM receiving
   inspections are IAW applicable technical data.
       7.9.1.1. All CAS-managed NWRM assets will be received and picked up on CAS
       records. In addition, ensure AFI 20-110 NWRM receiving requirements are followed.
       7.9.1.2. All Category I and II AA&E, and classified AA&E shipments will be checked
       immediately upon receipt to ensure that the seals are intact and for any signs of damage
       or tampering. If there are any signs of damage or tampering there must be an immediate
       inventory to verify quantities received and to determine extent of any damage or
       tampering.
       7.9.1.3. Receive shipped assets from other CAS DoDAACs onto CAS accountable
       records before any other actions are taken with the received assets. (T-0).
EXCEPTION: Receive Test/Contract munitions IAW paragraph 7.16.
       7.9.1.4. Process receipt details in CAS Receipts (AMI41A) or with use of CAS AIT
       Receipt menu.
       7.9.1.5. If the received asset is a PGM or TMRS tracked item, ensure the receipt of the
       assets in TMRS.
       7.9.1.6. Receiving Munitions with RAM: Receipts or shipment s munitions with RAM
       (e.g., 30MM API with DU) will be coordinated with the IRSO before they occur IAW
       AFI 40-201. (T-1).
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                       131


  7.9.2. Verifying Documentation. (T-1). Personnel authorized to receipt for munitions will
  in-check assets. In-checking consists of comparing shipping documents with outer container
  markings (identity & quantity).
     7.9.2.1. All in-checked NWRM will be cross-referenced by P/N against the NSN using
     the appropriate reference (C1100, Fedlog, etc.) to ensure accuracy of the NSN received.
     7.9.2.2. When the received quantity, lot number, or NSN is different from the shipping
     document, the in-checker will circle the erroneous information on the document, enter the
     correct information, and initial. Initiate research to resolve any discrepancy noted during
     the in-check of munitions assets IAW paragraph 7.9.3.
     7.9.2.3. CAS does not currently transfer lot history upon receipt of assets at the receiving
     DoDAAC. The most current inspection history record from the shipper's DoDAAC must
     be manually entered after receipt of assets. There are two methods to obtain the
     Inspection History record:
         7.9.2.3.1. Method 1. Access CAS Lot History Inspection Report (AM615A) and
         updated the DoDAAC to the shipper's DoDAAC and enter the NSN and lot number.
         7.9.2.3.2. Method 2. Access CAS Inspection History Inquiry (AMQ05A) and change
         the DoDAAC to the shipper's DoDAAC and enter "Type of Asset" via the dropdown
         menu.
     7.9.2.4. For shipments received from non-CAS units (depot, contractor, vendors, etc.)
     with no shipping document number, in-check assets using the first 14 digits of the TCN
     (if available). If no TCN is available, in-check the assets using a locally generated
     FVXXXX document number.
  7.9.3. Receipt Discrepancies. (T-0). Refer to and report NWRM discrepancies IAW AFI
  20-110. In addition, munitions received without sufficient accountability documentation,
  including COTS munitions, are processed as follows:
     7.9.3.1. Incoming ammunition shipments of nonstandard items received without
     sufficient documentation constitute a potential safety hazard to both facilities and
     personnel. Notify the MUNS Supt/Munitions Flight Chief prior to accepting these assets.
     7.9.3.2. Contact the shipping activity and request information/documentation is provided
     immediately.
     7.9.3.3. After all information is validated, prepare an off-line shipping document, DD
     Form 1348-1A, and process the receipt. Stamp/annotate the DD Form 1348-1A,
     “Shipping Documentation Not Received”. COTS documents will be stamped “COTS
     Munitions Documents Not Required.”
     7.9.3.4. Prepare and submit automated Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) using the web-
     based DoD WebSDR as prescribed by DLM 4000.25, Defense Logistics Management
     System (DLMS) Manual, Vol. II, Supply, Chapter 17, Supply Discrepancy Reporting and

7.10. Issues. (T-1). There are two types of Issues: Consumption and Custody.
   7.10.1. General Issue Procedures. (T-1). In addition to specific consumption and custody
   issues procedures in paragraphs 7.10.2 and 7.10.3, the following general procedures will be
   followed:
       7.10.1.1. Issue requests shall be submitted electronically to the munitions organization.
       The MASO may authorize verbal or written requests.
       7.10.1.2. Munitions will be issued in QUP or “LITE box” configuration when possible,
       to limit creation of “non-standard” packaging not within SPI configuration, which creates
       a possible hazard class conflict as described in T.O. 11A-1-10.
       7.10.1.3. All issue requests will include the following:
          7.10.1.3.1. ORG/Shop code.
          7.10.1.3.2. Nomenclature.
          7.10.1.3.3. NSN.
          7.10.1.3.4. Quantity.

AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                          133


          7.10.1.3.6. The words "CLASSIFIED ITEM" if applicable.
NOTE: Documents associated with NWRM assets will be stamped “NWRM CLASSIFIED
ITEM”.
          7.10.1.3.7. Date and time required.
          7.10.1.3.8. Issue type.
          7.10.1.3.9. Grounding date (For consumption issue for aircraft time change items).
      7.10.1.4. Emergency Issues: An emergency issue is an unforeseen consumption or
      custody issue requirement that may prevent a unit from performing its mission unless the
      munitions item can be issued and installed/consumed within 12 hours of issue.
          7.10.1.4.1. The MUNS Superintendent/Munitions Flight Chief determines
          supportability. If Munitions supervision determines the request is supportable no
          emergency issue approval is required.
          7.10.1.4.2. In cases of competing priorities (e.g., semi-annual inventories) emergency
          requests must be justified and approved, in writing, by the group commander or
          designated representative with command authority over the munitions issuing
          organization. The approval must accompany the issue request. Designated
          representatives must be appointed in writing and will not be lower than a unit
          commander.
   7.10.2. Consumption Issues. Consumption issues are limited to those assets consumed or
   installed within 15 calendar days (i.e., DIFM, Time Change).
EXCEPTION: Shop stock issues, RDT&E activities, and SmACC issues are not bound by the
15 calendar day rule.
      7.10.2.1. If storage, security or safety requirements cannot be satisfied limit consumption
      issues to the amount to be consumed on the day of issue.
      7.10.2.2. Use consumption issue to support internal and external munitions (i.e., CMT,
      SGO training, Load Barn, and RDT&E).
      7.10.2.3. Consumption issues include SmACC, Stockpile Consumption, and DIFM:
          7.10.2.3.1. SmACC: (T-1). To issue basic/combat loads of 5.56mm and 9mm small
          arms ammunition only. SmACC issues relieve the MASO of physical and materiel
          accountability/liability for those assets and transfers accountability to the organization
          user and/or user’s chain of command. The following procedures will be used for
          SmACC issues:
             7.10.2.3.1.1. Before processing any SmACC issue, each DoDAAC within an
             active combat zone must obtain and maintain approval in writing by the
             MAJCOM or NAF Munitions Staff (or equivalent). The approval must specify
             the DoDAAC and the time period that SmACC issues are authorized (e.g., month,
             FY, until authorization is rescinded). The approval remains in effect for the stated
             period regardless of MASO appointment. Any rescission and re-approval to
             perform SmACC issues must be through the MAJCOM/NAF, however the
 134                                                                 AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


              MASO or local commanders may place SmACC procedures in abeyance locally
              at their discretion.
              7.10.2.3.1.2. Do not use SmACC issue procedures for any of the following:
                  7.10.2.3.1.2.1. Non-deployed     operations:         Operating from the
                  individual/unit’s permanently assigned installation in CONUS or OCONUS.
                  Do not use SmACC issues to provide personnel deploying from CONUS to
                  deployed combat locations.
EXCEPTION: AFSOC enabling or support forces may use SmACC procedures from CONUS
with approval of the MAJCOM/NAF Munitions Staff (or equivalent).
                  7.10.2.3.1.2.2. In-garrison operations (e.g., gate guards, routine base security
                  operations, nuclear weapons custodial duties, training). Support these
                  operations only from custody accounts established IAW paragraph 7.8.
                  7.10.2.3.1.2.3. Any ammunition and explosives other than basic/combat loads
                  of 5.56mm and 9mm small arms ammunition used for personal defense.
              7.10.2.3.1.3. Only process SmACC issues to the default ORG/SHP code 920CC
              under CAT Code T. Units do not generate an AF Form 68 for ORG/SHP code
              920CC.
              7.10.2.3.1.4. Before processing a SmACC issue, obtain a copy of the individual’s
              orders and maintain with the original consumption issue documents. Maintain the
              personnel orders and consumption issue documents together IAW the AF RDS in
              AFRIMS.
              7.10.2.3.1.5. Relief from accountability for SmACC issues occurs only after the
              physical assets are turned over to the user and the individual or organizational
              user has been briefed on and signed the SmACC Issue Acknowledgement
              Statement shown in Figure 7.3.
              7.10.2.3.1.6. The individual issuing ammunition using SmACC procedures (e.g.,
              Munitions Operations or Munitions Inspection personnel) is responsible to ensure
              the following “SmACC Issue Acknowledgment Statement” is printed on the back
              of the issue document (DD 1348-1, AF IMT 4331, etc.) and is signed by the
              receiver before releasing assets:

Figure 7.3. SmACC Issue Acknowledgement Statement.
“Persons receiving small arms ammunition must maintain control, accountability, and lot
number integrity. The receiver will document all expended assets on the back of the AF IMT
4331. If it is impossible for the receiver to return small arms ammunition to the point of issue
prior to departing the Area of Responsibility (AOR), the receiver will make every attempt to turn
small arms ammunition over to another U.S. military authority or munitions storage area/supply
point (e.g., Army, Navy, Marines). Only place small arms ammunition in amnesty boxes if there
is no other U.S. military authority or munitions storage area available or if other U.S. military
authority or munitions storage area refuses to accept the small arms ammunition. If turned over
to a U.S. military authority or storage area, member will receive documentation showing who
accepted accountability for the assets to include: Name, rank, organization, and home base
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                          135


DSN (Do not use SSN). The receiver is responsible to ensure this documentation is forwarded by
any means available to the original issuing authority as soon as possible, but no later than 10
duty days after return to home station. Failure to comply after 10 days will result in the contact
with the receiver’s commander. If assets must be placed into an amnesty box, document the
quantity of small arms ammunition deposited, the quantity of small arms if expended, signature,
and date on the back of the AF IMT 4331 and forward by any means available to the original
issuing authority as soon as possible, but no later than 10 duty days after return to home station.
Failure to comply after 10 days will result in contact with the receiver’s commander.
           7.10.2.3.2. Stockpile Consumption Issue: (T-1). To issue assets from DoDAAC
           stock account for installation or use (e.g., replace AUR components, stuff containers).
           Process these issues against ORG/SHP code 002SM. These documents will be signed
           by munitions personnel authorized to receipt for munitions assets. An AF Form 68 is
           not required.
               7.10.2.3.2.1. The MASO may consumption issue an entire QUP of shop stock
               type items regardless of allocation quantity, (e.g., if an allocation of 1,136 feet
               remains for arming wire, an entire roll of 5K feet is authorized for issue).
               Increase the remaining allocation Asset Level Stratification (AMG04) to allow the
               issue of the asset, then reset the remaining allocation to zero. Allocation increases
               above the initial QUP via ATR/OOCR are justification to issue additional
               quantities up to QUP.
               7.10.2.3.2.2. If unused pieces and parts remain from a consumption issue and the
               parts are no longer required, process an Expenditure TIN IAW paragraph 7.12.4
               to inspect and return parts to stock.
               7.10.2.3.2.3. Units will ensure enough assets remain available on stock in CAS to
               support CR builds and expenditures.
               7.10.2.3.2.4. Use the consumption issue process for items requiring disposal of
               explosive munitions by EOD.
                   7.10.2.3.2.4.1. Use the “default” EOD ORG/SHP code 920RW under CAT
                   Code Y only assets requiring EOD disposal (see paragraph 3.13.7.5). Units
                   do not generate an AF Form 68 for ORG/SHP code 920RW.
                   7.10.2.3.2.4.2. Use the MASO correspondence memorandum, “Personnel
                   Authorized to Dispose of Munitions” provided by EOD to validate personnel
                   authorized to sign and date the CAS generated document. Signature of EOD
                   personnel on the CAS document constitutes DEMIL certification. No
                   additional signatures are required.
           7.10.2.3.3. DIFM Consumption Issue: (T-1). Used to issue high value and/or
           field/depot repairable and reusable assets when return of a like item carcass is
           expected. Unless otherwise stated, issue and control all ERRC code “XD” assets
           using DIFM procedures. Do not use DIFM for any air-launched/dropped munitions
           and their associated inert/dummy/training assets. Use CAS DIFM listing (AM535A)
           to monitor DIFM assets to ensure they are returned within 15 calendar days. The 15
           calendar day count starts from the date assets were physically received by the
           customer.
136                                                                   AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


             7.10.2.3.3.1. For initial issue requests use “DIFM bypass” Indicator.
             7.10.2.3.3.2. All replacement AFE munitions requirements, regardless of ERRC,
             will be consumption issued using DIFM procedures.
  7.10.3. Custody Issues. A custody issue is used to supply an organization with munitions
  for the current FY period.
      7.10.3.1. DoDAACs supporting Air Force organic depot repair of munitions
      components, aircraft, and missiles (e.g., ALCs), and RDT&E activities, may issue ERRC
      code “XD” and time-change assets to custody accounts when supported assets are
      expected to be in repair, or used in support of test plans, for longer than 15-calendar days.
      7.10.3.2. Secure facilities and adequate storage must be available for all custody issues
      as outlined in AFI 31-101 and AFMAN 91-201.
  7.10.4. Munitions Pick-up Procedures.
      7.10.4.1. Customers receiving property must present a valid CAC or other DoD
      identification card. Only personnel listed on the AF Form 68 are authorized to receipt for
      assets.
      7.10.4.2. After validation that an individual is an authorized representative of the
      commander, the property will be signed for and released.
      7.10.4.3. The receiving individual will verify property received by checking the NSN, lot
      number, CC and quantity before signing for property.
      7.10.4.4. If changes have occurred to documents (quantity, lot number, etc.), the
      document shall not be signed and the recipient will notify Munitions Operations
      immediately.
      7.10.4.5. Responsibility for safety, security and accountability for munitions from the
      time of issue remains with the using organization. This includes lot number integrity.
  7.10.5. Organizational Refusals. Organizations refusing a previously requested issue of
  assets, must complete and provide proper Turn-In documentation for the refusal IAW
  paragraph 7.12. The refusing organization will sign the issue document and annotate
  “ORGANIZATIONAL REFUSAL” on the face of the document and provide a brief
  description of the circumstances surrounding the refusal. Organizational refusals may be
  processed electronically via e-mail, etc. MASOs should notify commanders when their
  organizations have excessive refusals within a one year period.
  7.10.6. Issue of Non-NCAA WRM Small Arms in Support of Emergencies. The MASO
  appointing authority is authorized to direct (in writing) emergency issue of Non-NCAA
  WRM small arms ammunition to AF personnel for periods up to 30 calendar days to support
  disaster relief, humanitarian missions, and major accident responses. E-mail is acceptable to
  direct this authority.

        these assets for up to 180 calendar days.
        7.10.6.2.2. Requests for more than 180 calendar days must be approved by
        AF/A4LW.
  7.10.7. Supplying Small Arms Ammunition to Units at Deployed Locations.
     7.10.7.1. Supply small arms ammunition IAW the reporting instructions and final
     destination/line remarks on individual orders. Maintain a copy of the individual’s orders
     with the custody issue documents until assets are turned-in and receipt/disposition of the
     small arms is validated. Process custody issues IAW paragraph 7.10.2. Process
     SmACC issues IAW paragraph 7.10.1.3.1.
     7.10.7.2. The supplying unit (e.g., LRS, Munitions Flight, SFS) will ensure local written
     policy exists to ensure small arms are returned to the supplying unit while maintaining lot
     number integrity. The supplying unit will use the AF IMT 4331 to document issue of all
     small arms ammunition and will be completed with the following information:
        7.10.7.2.1. Name of issuer, name receiver; home station, unit, and DSN; deployed
        station, unit, and DSN; NSN, noun, lot number, cartridge case markings, quantity

        4331 and maintain the original AF IMT 4331 IAW the AF RDS in AFRIMS. Ensure
        the issuing authority’s mailing address, FAX number, and organizational e-mail
        address is clearly printed on the AF IMT 4331. The MASO will ensure that AF IMT
        4331 used for SmACC issues are maintained IAW the AF RDS in AFRIMS.
        7.10.7.2.3. Utilize the AF IMT 4331 in conjunction with CAS Transaction History
        Listing (AM903) to screen and identify 5.56mm and 9mm small arms ammunition
        issued to ORG/SHP code 920CC for CMRS. If restricted or suspended SmACC is
        identified, the issuing MASO will make and document attempts to locate and notify
        individuals/units.
 138                                                                 AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


       7.10.7.3. Every attempt will be made to return small arms ammunition to the point of
       issue upon departure from the AOR.
       7.10.7.4. The supplying unit commander will work closely with the base/theater
       Personnel Support for Contingency Operations office and NAF to ensure in-
       processing/out-processing checklists for deploying/redeploying personnel include
       Munitions Receipt/Turn-in checkpoints. Munitions checkpoints must be validated
       through use of a “Stamp” rather than initials/signatures to ensure personnel return issued
       ammunition prior to out-processing the theater.
7.11. Expenditures. (T-1). Expenditures are processed to account for and document physical
consumption of DoDAAC stock account and custody account munitions. Expenditures fall into
two categories: Custody Expenditures and Stockpile Expenditures:
   7.11.1. Custody Account Expenditures. The consuming organization or activity provides
   the MASO with validated and electronic expenditure requests within 2 duty days of use.
EXCEPTION: ANG and AFRC units that do not have full time manned account custodians
may submit account expenditures within 5 duty days. Refer to paragraph 7.8 for Custody
Account Management procedures.
       7.11.1.1. Custodians will include the following on expenditure requests:

          commander.
       7.11.1.2. SOCOM and AFCENT munitions units supporting non-traditional operations
       may manage and expend assets from custody account with AFSOC/AFCENT approval.
   7.11.2. Stockpile Expenditures: Used to process expenditures for assets managed directly
   from the DoDAAC stock account. This is not utilized for custody managed assets and
   generally is only used for aircraft support munitions and munitions managed internally by the
   MASO and Munitions unit/activity.
       7.11.2.1. Controlling and Processing Stockpile Expenditures: Control expenditures from
       the DoDAAC stock record account through active and continuous allocation and
       inventory management. Utilize the Level Reconciliation Listing (AMC12A) and CAS
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                     139


       generated reports to ensure peacetime assets are not expended without an approved
       allocation.
NOTE: It is not necessary to load or manage levels for valid WRM, combat, or contingency
expenditures. Use the “Level Bypass” option and expend IAW paragraph 7.11.2.2.
          7.11.2.1.1. Personnel performing munitions tasks and operations (e.g., munitions
          crews, weapons expediters) process expenditures in CAS using automated-, direct-, or
          remote-input methods IAW paragraph 7.1.1.3.1.
          7.11.2.1.2. Munitions assets staged, assembled, and configured for delivery/or use
          remain on the DoDAAC stock account until physically expended. Once physically
          expended, assets are expended in CAS against the appropriate CAT Code and
          ORG/SHP code.
          7.11.2.1.3. After expenditures from DoDAAC stock are processed in CAS, the
          MASO will validate that these transactions were processed correctly by comparing
          the CAS Transaction History Listing, AM903 against the AF IMT 2434, AF IMT
          4331, and/or other documents. Discrepancies must be researched and corrected.
          7.11.2.1.4. Ensure that expenditures are recorded in TMRS for all TMRS tracked
          assets.
       7.11.2.2. WRM Munitions Expenditures:
          7.11.2.2.1. Do not expend WRM munitions in peacetime without approval of the
          MAJCOM or higher in contingencies; and AF/A4LW (ground) or AF/A5R-C (air
          munitions) in peacetime. This includes munitions positioned in support of allocations
          for CAT Codes B, F, G, M, X, and Z.
          7.11.2.2.2. Only after assets are physically expended are they designated as WRM
          (or other category). Do not segregate munitions in stock based on allocated CAT
          Code/quantity.
          7.11.2.2.3. Munitions expended for a valid WRM, combat, or contingency purpose in
          Categories F, G, T, or X will be processed in CAS against the ORG/SHP codes
          identified in the WRM, Combat, or Contingency ORG/SHP Expenditure Processing
          Codes table located on the GACP website (HQ USAF/ A4LW Information) link.
          These ORG/SHP codes will be used regardless of original allocated ORG/SHP code,
          quantity, or CAT Code.
              7.11.2.2.3.1. This ORG/SHP code structure for WRM, Combat, or Contingency
              expenditures for CAT Code F, G, T, and X enables automated extraction and
              reporting of expenditure data by “Operation” from automated systems (e.g., CAS,
              Global Combat Support System – Air Force (GCSS-AF) Data Services).
              7.11.2.2.3.2. Additions, deletions, or changes to the WRM, Combat, or
              Contingency ORG/SHP Expenditure Processing Codes will be posted to the
              GACP website by AF/A4LW or GACP.
          7.11.2.2.4. Prior to processing expenditures against ORG/SHP codes for WRM,
          combat, or contingency operations, units must establish these ORG/SHP codes in
          CAS.
 140                                                                 AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


           7.11.2.2.5. It is not necessary to load levels for valid WRM, combat, or contingency
           expenditures. Use the “Level Bypass” option when expending against these
           ORG/SHP codes.
           7.11.2.2.6. The GACP will update the support data edits table in CAS program
           Manage System Edits (AMA10 ) for label name “LEVEL BYPASS ORG SHOP
           CODES”. The Manage System Edits (AMA10) screen only allows additions or
           deletions. Any errors will require deletion and reloading.
       7.11.2.3. Aircraft Munitions Expenditures: The Air Force goal is to process aircraft
       munitions expenditure in CAS within one hour of aircraft recovery. Except as noted
       otherwise in this publication, aircraft expenditures will be processed as aircraft recover
       throughout the flying day, but no later than between aircraft goes.
           7.11.2.3.1. The one-hour expenditure processing goal may be unattainable if
           Weapons Expediters must depart the flightline area to process expenditure
           transactions. Infrastructure limits automated-input processing capability (e.g., no
           wireless on flightline). In this case, munitions and weapons managers must decide
           which expenditure processing method best serves the mission.
           7.11.2.3.2. Weapons Expediters:       During SGO, Weapons Expediters manage
           munitions assets on the flightline. They execute flightline support and munitions
           accountability processes through validation of aircraft load/expenditure accuracy.
           Weapons expediters reconcile munitions/weapons data, document (as required), and
           facilitate processing movement and expenditure transactions in CAS using
           automated-, direct-, or remote-input methods IAW paragraph 7.1.1.3.1.
           7.11.2.3.3. When automated input is not used, document flightline munitions activity
           and expenditures on an AF IMT 2434 (or local form) IAW AFI 21-101 or AF IMT
           4331. Turn in all documentation to the Munitions Control activity for verification
           and MASO validation against the CAS daily transaction history. Route the AF IMT
           2434 or AF IMT 4331 through the workcenter managing TMRS to update flight
           hours for TMRS tracked items. The AF IMT 4331 or AF IMT 2434 may be
           destroyed after validation.
           7.11.2.3.4. Do not process aircraft gun ammunition and countermeasure expenditures
           using automated, direct, or remote-input.          Aircraft gun ammunition and
           countermeasures are managed as full loads (minus “kickback” rounds) until weapons
           personnel download the gun/magazines and expended rounds are processed by
           maintenance to validate actual expenditures and process the expenditure in CAS.
EXCEPTION: Weapons Expediters supporting Special Operations Forces (SOF) and Search
and Rescue (SAR) aircraft may immediately process expenditures on the flightline if an entire
container of ammunition is empty. Otherwise, manage a container as a full load until the gun is
downloaded and remaining rounds are processed by maintenance.
           7.11.2.3.5. Do not use the Structure Expenditure (AM723A) process to remove
           assets from accountable record when aircraft depart/deploy from home station with
           munitions. Refer to paragraph 7.6, Deployed Munitions Management.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                        141


           7.11.2.3.6. Processing Aircraft Expenditures using AIT: To support munitions
           expenditures using the HHT, the ORG/SHP code and Munitions CAT Code must be
           loaded against a specific aircraft (Container ID) data record. If the ORG/SHP code
           and Munitions CAT Code are not loaded the transaction will error out and be retained
           in the CAS AIT Conflict Resolution (AMP09A) program.
              7.11.2.3.6.1. If AIT is available on the flightline, but temporarily off-line or out
              of wireless range, the HHT scanners will operate in “Batch Mode” and continue
              to collect transaction data.
              7.11.2.3.6.2. When operating in Batch Mode, weapons expediters must ensure
              that all “unprocessed” Batch Mode transactions are synchronized (processed by
              gaining wireless connectivity or HHT docking) prior to processing movements
              to/from or expending assets from recovered aircraft.
NOTE: Synchronizing ensures that transactions are processed in the correct chronological
sequence, as they occurred.
   7.11.3. Expenditures of FMS, Test, Training, and by MOA/MOU Operations (CAT
   Code N). Munitions allocated as CAT Code N MOA/MOU IAW paragraph 9.6.7.2 will be
   expended against non-WR ORG/SHP codes created for these specific purposes.
   7.11.4. End of Fiscal Year (FY) Expenditure Close Out. Annually, in the first week of
   September, the MASO ensures commanders and custodians are notified (in writing or by e-
   mail) to submit their end of FY expenditures to the Munitions Operations office NLT close
   of business on 29 September. Ensure all end of FY expenditures are processed in CAS prior
   to 2400 hours, Central Standard Time (CST) on 30 September.
NOTE: Expenditures not processed prior to this cutoff will be processed against new FY
allocations and an OOCR will be processed IAW paragraph 7.4.2 for the quantity expended
beyond the cutoff.
7.12. Turn-Ins. (T-1). All turn-ins refer to assets being returned to the DoDAAC stock record
account. There are five types of turn-ins: Organizational Turn-in (ORG TIN), Custody Turn-in,
Expenditure Turn-in, Due-in From Maintenance (DIFM) Turn-in, and Found on Base (FOB)
Turn-in.
   7.12.1. Processing Turn-in Requests. Users coordinate with the Munitions Flight to turn-
   in munitions. All turn-in requests will include the following:
NOTE: Personnel authorized to receipt munitions being turned in from munitions users are
designated “in-checkers” and perform in-check of turned in assets. In-check of turned-in assets
consists of comparing turn-in documents to physical assets, outer container markings (identity &
quantity), proper packaging, and safety.
       7.12.1.1. Nomenclature.
       7.12.1.2. NSN.
       7.12.1.3. Quantity
       7.12.1.4. Lot Number.
       7.12.1.5. CAT Code (if applicable).
142                                                                AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


      7.12.1.6. CC (If known).
      7.12.1.7. Document number of the original issue (if applicable).
      7.12.1.8. Reason for turn-in.
      7.12.1.9. In-checker signature, printed name, and date.
  7.12.2. Organizational Turn-in (ORG TIN). Used for turn-in of:
      7.12.2.1. Assets when the origin is known. If the origin of assets is not known, use FOB
      Turn-in procedures in paragraph 7.12.6.
      7.12.2.2. Components removed from an AUR when replacement components are not
      requisitioned.
      7.12.2.3. Empty containers.
      7.12.2.4. SDM.
      7.12.2.5. Recovered stock-listed assets previously adjusted off accountable record when
      a zero-balance exists. If a stock balance exists, refer to IAD Procedures in paragraph
      7.14.
      7.12.2.6. Process ORG TIN using the CAS FOB Turn-In (AM555A) program.
         7.12.2.6.1. In the Comments block enter: “ORG TIN” and a brief description (e.g.,
         Component TIN, Container TIN, Static Display TIN, or Recovered Asset TIN).
         7.12.2.6.2. When “ORG TIN” is annotated in the comments block, the mandatory
         documents outlined in paragraph 7.14, Inventory Adjustment Transaction (AM427J)
         procedures are not required unless it meets the requirements of paragraph 7.14.4.1.
      7.12.2.7. ORG TINs do not require a special inventory before processing an ORG TIN
      FOB transaction.
      7.12.2.8. For any recovered items that are non-stock listed, refer to procedures in
      paragraph 3.12.10
  7.12.3. Custody Turn-in. Used for turn-in of assets from custody accounts.
  7.12.4. Expenditure Turn-in. Used for assets originally consumption issued during the
  current FY, and were not consumed.
      7.12.4.1. This process will not be used to turn-in assets erroneously expended from a
      custody account. Units must process an RVP or inventory adjustment to correct errors.
      7.12.4.2. Turn-in of assets originally consumption issued in a previous FY should be
      picked up using the ORG TIN process. If assets are classified “For Training Use Only”,
      items can be reissued to custody accounts to fill authorized training allocations.
      7.12.4.3. Upon turn-in of SmACC, lot integrity will be assessed/maintained as follows:
         7.12.4.3.1. When SmACC is turned in by an individual who was originally issued the
         small arms ammunition along with the original AF IMT 4331 issue document and all
         case markings match, then lot integrity is assumed. These assets may be inspected,
         turned-in using Expenditure Turn-in procedures and re-issued for custody/SmACC if
         otherwise serviceable.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                        143


NOTE: Do not use cartridge case markings to establish the year of manufacture of small arms
ammunition, however the cartridge case markings may be used to validate general accuracy of
AF IMT 4331 lot number information for rounds returned by the individual they were originally
issued to.
          7.12.4.3.2. Rounds received/recovered from amnesty programs/boxes or if the
          ammunition lot number of rounds returned by individuals cannot be validated, utilize
          FOB TIN procedures IAW paragraph 7.12.6 to pick-up assets in the appropriate CC.
          These rounds may be accumulated for inspection and TIN processing once TIN
          quantities exceed 100 rounds.
   7.12.5. Due-in From Maintenance (DIFM) Turn-in. Used for turn-in of assets originally
   issued under DIFM control.
       7.12.5.1. Use ORG TIN procedures for turn-in of assets that were issued in a previous
       FY and no replacement item is required.
       7.12.5.2. When turn-in of an asset from maintenance under a DIFM document number is
       not the same NSN as the issued asset, process the DIFM turn-in using the NSN issued to
       clear the outstanding DIFM detail. Then process a Selective Identity Change to correct
       the NSN to that of the asset that was turned in.
   7.12.6. FOB Turn-in. Used to turn-in DoD stock-listed munitions where the origin of
   assets cannot be determined.
       7.12.6.1. For recovered items that are not stock-listed, refer to procedures in paragraph
       3.12.10
       7.12.6.2. The MASO reviews all FOB transactions to determine the need for a Special
       inventory before processing the document. The MASO signs the document to indicate a
       review of Special inventory requirements.
7.13. Munitions Shipments.
   7.13.1. Integrated Data Environment/Global Transportation Network/Convergence
   (IGC). IGC provides in-transit visibility of munitions movements through the Cargo
   Movement Operations System (CMOS).
NOTE: Personnel with previous Global Transportation Network (GTN) accounts must reapply
for an IGC account at the IGC homepage specified in paragraph 1.4.11.
       7.13.1.1. An interface exists between CAS and CMOS (or IGC), however not all
       interfaces are functional (or may be disabled), therefore, at a minimum the MASO will
       ensure appropriate personnel maintain an IGC account to track shipments.
       7.13.1.2. In the event you do not have Internet capabilities, establish a local policy with
       your servicing transportation unit to provide access to the data to track shipment status.
       (T-3).
   7.13.2. Authorization to Receipt for Munitions. (T-1). Before munitions and explosive,
   including classified items, are released to anyone for movement/shipment, agencies/activities
   that will accept munitions must provide a written and signed listing of individuals authorized
   to receipt for the items.
 144                                                                  AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


       7.13.2.1. The authorization listing will include the name, rank, and security clearance of
       each authorized individual. Signature specimens will also be provided on the list or on an
       attached signature card with printed name and date of signature.
       7.13.2.2. The authorization listing is required regardless of digital signature capability.
       However, if the receiving agency/activity has the capability to digitally sign and receipt
       for munitions being received/shipped, then no signature specimen is required on the
       listing.
       7.13.2.3. In the event digital signature capability is lost or post-post and manual
       procedures are implemented, obtain signature specimens and actual signatures for all
       munitions shipments/receipts.
NOTE: Signature specimens are used to validate current shipment documents only. Signature
specimens are not required or maintained to validate historical shipment documents. These were
validated at the point of shipment.
       7.13.2.4. The following agencies/activities will provide a listing as follows:
          7.13.2.4.1. Munitions Supervision/MASO will provide the local transportation office
          a listing of personnel authorized to receipt for inbound munitions items.
          7.13.2.4.2. The local transportation office will provide the MASO a listing of
          personnel authorized to receipt for outbound munitions items.
          7.13.2.4.3. For Air Force organic movements, the gaining MASO must provide the
          losing MASO a listing of personnel authorized to receipt for inbound munitions.
          7.13.2.4.4. To release shipped munitions directly to a government contract
          carrier/vendor (e.g., Raytheon, Honeywell, ATK), the SPO/PM for that materiel must
          coordinate, approve, and provide the releasing MASO a listing of vendor personnel
          authorized to receipt for outbound munitions.
              7.13.2.4.4.1. The SPO/PM is responsible to obtain the list from the
              vendor/carrier, approve it, and forward the approved list to each appropriate
              releasing MASO.
              7.13.2.4.4.2. The SPO/PM will update the list as changes occur and re-
              accomplish annually.
   7.13.3. Processing Shipments. (T-1).
       7.13.3.1. NWRM: (T-1). CAS-managed NWRM assets will be shipped in CAS. Refer
       to AFI 20-110 for NWRM shipments and Nuclear Ordnance Shipping Schedule Report of
       Shipment (REPSHIP) procedures.
       7.13.3.2. Missiles and Components: Ship missiles and components once QUP is
       reached, as required. (T-2). The GACP may approve less than QUP after coordination
       with the PM. (T-2). Unserviceable components will be shipped to depot facilities using
       priority 02 and CC-F. (T-1).
       7.13.3.3. Transportation personnel need not sign a shipping document unless it is
       processed through the transportation activity. EXAMPLE: Munitions moved by
       munitions personnel from base-A to base-B.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                      145


     7.13.3.4. When assets require shipment for return and repair, use instructions issued by
     the IM or SPO as direction and guidance for the shipment.
     7.13.3.5. When tasked to ship MICAP and priority 02, shipment of less than QUP is
     authorized. Turn the documentation over to transportation within 24 hours.
     7.13.3.6. Units will review the Unsatisfied RDO Listing (AM124A) daily. This listing
     serves as authority to ship assets. Units unable to support requests, contact the GACP
     and get approval to deny the RDO. Once the GACP approves the denial, the unit will
     process an RDO denial in the RDO Shipment (AM123A) program.
     7.13.3.7. Once the property is released to or scheduled with the servicing transportation
     unit, update the CAS in-transit record indicating date sent to transportation and estimated
     ship date. Update the DDO via the Manage Intransits (AMI07A) or the Inquire and
     Update Outbounds (AMI08A) screens when shipments physically depart station. Then,
     update the TMRS In-transit Record (if applicable) for the shipment by inputting the
     physical departure date.
  7.13.4. Accounting for Munitions In-Transit. Munitions activities will retain physical
  accountability of munitions assets placed in an intransit status until the actual DDO. (T-0).
     7.13.4.1. Storage activities shipping assets to satisfy requisitions are responsible to
     provide shipment status to the appropriate Source of Supply (e.g., GACP) when
     required/requested IAW DLM 4000.25, Vol. 2, Supply Standard Procedures, Chapter 4,
     Requisitioning. (T-0).
     7.13.4.2. When the shipping munitions activity selects assets for shipment in CAS, they
     are loaded to the CAS Intransit Asset Table. When the shipping Munitions activity
     updates the DDO in CAS, the local DoDAAC, location, and structure are removed from
     the assets.
     7.13.4.3. Ensure all intransit shipments temporarily stored within the MSA that did not
     originate from that base DoDAAC are loaded and managed in CAS using the Non-
     Accountable (AM101A) program. (T-1).
         7.13.4.3.1. When shipments erroneously DDO’d or dropped off record are scheduled
         to depart station within 30 calendar days, manage the assets on CAS Non-
         Accountable (AM101A) program. (T-1). When these shipment actually depart the
         installation, clear these assets from the Non-accountable program (AM101A).
         7.13.4.3.2. Do not manage erroneously DDO’d or dropped off record shipment assets
         in AM101A beyond 30 calendar days. When shipments erroneously DDO’d or
         dropped off record are scheduled to depart station beyond 30 calendar days, cancel
         the shipment, pick up assets on accountable stock record, and if necessary reprocess
         the shipment in CAS. (T-0).
         7.13.4.3.3. Validate all intransit records during the weekly shipment reconciliation.
         (T-1).
     7.13.4.4. When CAS is not available at the shipping or receiving installation, the MASO
     must keep the servicing MAJCOM/NAF and the GACP apprised of the shipment status
     via any expedient and accurate means (e-mail, fax, etc.). (T-1).
 146                                                                AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


       7.13.4.5. Shipments between Air Force activities: (T-1).
           7.13.4.5.1. Munitions shipped from one Air Force FV DoDAAC to another FV
           DoDAAC will remain in the CAS Intransit Asset Table until received by the
           destination activity. Refer to paragraph 7.13.4.7 for all classified and sensitive
           munitions shipments regardless of origin or destination.
           7.13.4.5.2. Reconcile and document status of all outstanding shipments, by TCN,
           with the transportation activity.
           7.13.4.5.3. Verify the DDO in CAS once assets physically depart installation. For
           assets not updated by CMOS, process the DDO action manually in CAS.
NOTE: At installations with aerial ports, the CMOS – CAS interface may have been disabled
due to erroneous DDO feeds from CMOS. In these cases, the DDO must be updated manually.
           7.13.4.5.4. When assets are received in CAS by the destination Munitions activity,
           the assets will automatically drop off the CAS Intransit Asset Table and be picked up
           on the receiving FV DoDAAC account record.
           7.13.4.5.5. Munitions activities are responsible to actively follow-up by reviewing
           and monitoring the CAS intransit assets. If problems are suspected or noted, unit
           shippers and receivers will initiate communications (e.g., telephone, e-mail, CRM as
           appropriate) with the origin/destination, NAF, Lead Command, or GACP as
           appropriate to identify and resolve problems.
           7.13.4.5.6. In the event the recipient does not receive the material by the RDD, the
           recipient must follow-up through the transportation activity/unit if the DDO is not
           greater than 30 days. If the DDO is greater than 30 days, the recipient must initiate
           tracer action with transportation unit and/or Source of Supply using the TCN.
           Follow-up timelines for classified and sensitive munitions are IAW paragraph
           7.13.4.7.
       7.13.4.6. Shipments to Non-Air Force Activities: (T-1). Munitions shipment records to
       non-Air Force activities (e.g., retail/wholesale depots, manufacturer/contract repair
       facilities, other services/federal agencies) will automatically “clear” from the CAS
       Intransit Asset Table 30 days after the DDO is updated in CAS.
NOTE: Intransit records for classified and sensitive munitions categories identified in
paragraph 7.13.4.7 do not automatically clear. These records are cleared by the GACP.
       7.13.4.7. Classified and Sensitive Munitions Shipments: (T-0). The loss, theft, unlawful
       disposition, and/or recovery of Classified and Sensitive munitions require investigation
       IAW DLM 4000.25-2, Military Standard Transaction Reporting and Accounting
       Procedures (MILSTRAP) Manual. This requires a higher level of oversight to validate
       that shipment of classified and sensitive munitions are actually received at the intended
       destination before clearing shipments from the CAS Intransit Asset Table.
           7.13.4.7.1. Receipt validation applies to the following Classified and Sensitive Item
           categories:
              7.13.4.7.1.1. CIIC 1 – Very High Risk (Category I).
              7.13.4.7.1.2. CIIC 2 – High Risk (Category II).
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                   147


           7.13.4.7.1.3. CIIC 5 – Secret (Category I).
           7.13.4.7.1.4. CIIC 6 – Confidential (Category I).
           7.13.4.7.1.5. CIIC 8 – Confidential (Category II).
           7.13.4.7.1.6. CIIC C – Confidential.
           7.13.4.7.1.7. CIIC S – Secret.
           7.13.4.7.1.8. CIIC T – Top Secret.
        7.13.4.7.2. There are two methods to accomplish receipt validation depending on the
        origin/destination of the shipment. Receipt at an AF DoDAAC using the original
        CAS TCN or the GACP centrally validates shipment receipt and closes the Intransit
        record.
           7.13.4.7.2.1. Classified and Sensitive Shipments between Air Force DoDAACs:
           MASOs at AF installations receiving classified or sensitive munitions from other
           AF installations will receipt assets in CAS following normal receipt procedures
           which will clear intransit records from the CAS Intransit Asset Table.
               7.13.4.7.2.1.1. Ensure all classified and sensitive munitions assets are
               receipted properly using the CAS TCN. Receipt in CAS constitutes proper
               “validation” only when the receipt is processed using the CAS TCN and the
               shipment is cleared from the CAS Intransit Asset Table. Personnel receiving
               these classified and sensitive assets are responsible to the MASO to validate
               the shipment was cleared from the CAS Intransit Asset Table.
               7.13.4.7.2.1.2. If the CAS TCN cannot be used or the CAS Intransit Asset
               Table did not properly clear the shipment, receive these assets using a local
               TCN, and immediately notify the GACP through the CRM and report the
               following information:
                 7.13.4.7.2.1.2.1. Reason CAS TCN could not be used.
                 7.13.4.7.2.1.2.2. Original CAS TCN (if any).
                 7.13.4.7.2.1.2.3. Local TCN used to receipt assets.
                 7.13.4.7.2.1.2.4. NSN.
                 7.13.4.7.2.1.2.5. Quantity.
                 7.13.4.7.2.1.2.6. Full Name, Organization, and DSN of personnel
                 processing receipt in CAS.
               7.13.4.7.2.1.3. Once this data is received, the GACP will close the intransit
               record.
           7.13.4.7.2.2. Classified and Sensitive Shipments to Non-Air Force Activities:
           The GACP will develop internal processes to validate receipt of assets and clear
           the CAS Intransit Asset Table records.
               7.13.4.7.2.2.1. GACP validation of classified and sensitive munitions
               shipments requires that each receiver acknowledge verbally, in writing, via e-
               mail (digital signature), or through other automated means (CAS, other
 148                                                               AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


                  application) that the shipped TCN, NSN, and quantity was actually received,
                  and the date assets were received.
                  7.13.4.7.2.2.2. Validation will be performed on all classified and sensitive
                  shipments that exceed the Estimated Delivery Date (EDD) or go beyond 30-
                  days from the DDO.
   7.13.5. PACER AMMO Project Codes. (T-1). PACER AMMO is the AF program to
   monitor and track worldwide munitions transportation costs using AFMC managed Second
   Destination Transportation (SDT) funds IAW paragraph 15.6. Assign the appropriate
   PACER AMMO project code and corresponding Transportation Account Code (TAC) IAW
   Table 7.4.
   7.13.6. PACER AMMO Transportation Account Codes (TAC). (T-1). The shipping
   activity will identify the appropriate TAC as follows:
       7.13.6.1. F8RT. Used for movement of missiles and associated components governed by
       the TAMP.
       7.13.6.2. F8UT. Used for movement of conventional and precision guided munitions
       governed by the DLAR.
       7.13.6.3. F8PT. Used for movement of all munitions to support warfighter contingency
       operations. Must be used in conjunction with an appropriate contingency project code
       (e.g., 3XX, 9XX).
       7.13.6.4. Non-DLAR/TAMP Shipments: (T-1). For munitions shipments not governed
       by the DLAR or TAMP, the activity directing or requesting the shipment (e.g.,
       MAJCOM, NAF, unit) will provide the shipping activity with an appropriate TAC or
       identify/direct the source of funding to be used (e.g., MAJCOM, shipping unit) within
       their authority and funding line of accounting.
NOTE: Unless otherwise stated, the GACP is not the directing/requesting activity for shipments
not covered by the TAMP/DLAR.
   7.13.7. ANG Munitions Transportation. (T-1).        ANG munitions requisitions and
   shipments related to ANG ADRs, maintenance returns, and CAD/PAD are not supported by
   the PACER AMMO Program.
       7.13.7.1. ANG TAC F8E0 will be used to fund all ANG shipments from depots and
       active duty units to ANG bases/units. ANG shipments between ANG bases will be
       funded using local O&M funds or other ANG TACs directed by NGB/A4RDT.
       7.13.7.2. Munitions shipments directed by the GACP from ANG to active duty units will
       use the PACER AMMO TACs and project codes IAW Table 7.4.
EXCEPTION: Munitions and missile shipments directed by the GACP to support ANG
deployments or contingency operations may use PACER AMMO TACs and contingency project
codes.
       7.13.7.3. For additional guidance on conventional munitions shipments to, from, and
       between ANG units refer to AFI 24-203.

Notes:
1. Munitions shipments may require the use of other Project and/or Contingency Support Codes
which reimburse the SDT account. Consult MAJCOM/NAF munitions staff or GACP for guidance
and authority.
2. For additional transportation project code guidance for munitions, contact AFMC/A4MW PACER
AMMO Support at DSN: 674-2718/787-3153 or e-mail: pacer.ammo@us.af.mil.
3. The activity/agency directing the shipment/movement provides direction to utilize Project Code
BLK. EXAMPLE: TACP/RACP RDO directs use of Project Code “BLK”.
4. When using project code 737, refer to AFI 24-203 for the proper use of TAC F8E0.
5. Maximize the use of ISO container space. Consider deferring partial loaded ISO containers for the
next retrograde shipment opportunity vice shipping a partial load. Coordinate shipment of an ISO load
to mixed destinations with the GACP.
6. Project codes 726, 730, and 733 are the only shipments authorized by airlift. All other project
codes are required to go by surface mode unless approved by AFMC/A4MW. Requests should be
submitted in writing by MAJCOM munitions functional/ammunition control points and forwarded to
AFMC/A4MW for approval/disapproval.
        7.13.8. ISO Container Shipments.
           7.13.8.1. Prior-to-use inspections will be performed before loading munitions for
           shipment and will consist of a visual interior and exterior examination for obvious
           defects. (T-0).
           7.13.8.2. Shipments of munitions using ISO containers that originate from munitions
           activities will attach CAS shipping documents and the Mass Shipment Report (AMI25R)
           to the inside of a door on each container. (T-1). Attach the original-signed DA Form
           2404 to the inside of a door on each container and maintain a copy of the DA Form 2404
           IAW DoD 4500.9-R. (T-0).
           7.13.8.3. AIT capable units will label container and contents as required. (T-0). Labels
           will be placed on the door near the consolidated data plate. (T-0).
           7.13.8.4. Ensure all applicable DOT markings are properly affixed. (T-0).
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                        151


       7.13.8.5. RFID tags are detached from the outer container surface and reattached to the
       inside of the container door or consolidated into a central location immediately upon
       removal of assets. (T-1). Reverse the battery to deactivate the tag prior to placing it
       inside the container. (T-1). This prevents the container from being tracked as a loaded
       container in the transportation system.
       7.13.8.6. ISO containers used in MASS munitions shipment procedures, prepared for
       shipment of munitions, or used for storage of munitions shall must be loaded as “ISO”
       type containers using CnC management procedures of CAS Container Maintenance
       (AM106A) program IAW paragraph 7.1.5. (T-1).
   7.13.9. FMS Shipments. (T-0).
       7.13.9.1. When assets are authorized for release IAW paragraph 9.6 as an approved
       FMS case ensure all shipping documents are annotated with "Released IAW FMS-CASE
       XXXX” and attach copies of authorizing correspondence.
       7.13.9.2. When an existing Acquisition Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) authorizes
       the release of FMS assets, and the MAJCOM/NAF A4 (or equivalent) has approved the
       release, annotate all documents with “Released IAW ACSA” and attach copies of
       authorizing correspondence to the shipping documents.
   7.13.10. Cancelled Shipments. (T-1). When a shipment is processed in CAS but does not
   depart the installation (e.g., DDO is not updated), the shipment can be cancelled if necessary.
   Do not RVP the shipment in CAS. Personnel process a shipment cancellation IAW the Air
   Force Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide. The document may be cleared from the
   AME01A screen in CAS without filing.
   7.13.11. Shipping Munitions with RAM. Shipments or receipts of munitions with RAM
   (e.g., 30MM API with DU) will be coordinated with the IRSO before shipments occur IAW
   AFI 40-201. (T-1).
7.14. Inventory Adjustment Transaction (AM427J) Procedures. When custody account or
stock record account discrepancies are discovered that could not be reconciled, the following
procedures will be used when processing an Inventory Adjustment:
   7.14.1. NWRM. Refer to AFI 20-110. (T-0).
   7.14.2. Theft, Negligence, or Inappropriate Use. (T-0). No AA&E loss shall be attributed
   to an accountability or inventory discrepancy if determined through investigation that the loss
   was the result of theft, negligence, or inappropriate use. Any adjustment involving an actual
   loss must be evaluated against the reporting criteria of DoD 5100.76-M.
   7.14.3. Investigating and Researching Shortage Discrepancies. (T-0).                  When
   discrepancies exist that involve imbalances between actual on-hand property and accountable
   records, the custodian, unit commanders, Munitions Operations element, and the MASO
   must conduct thorough research to determine the source of the discrepancy (excess/shortage),
   to include inventories of other custody accounts with items issued. Investigation and
   causative research must precede any IAD action that is not proved to be an administrative
   posting error.
   7.14.4. Investigating and Researching Overage Discrepancies. (T-0).              When a
   discrepancy involves finding more assets on stock than are on accountable records, conduct
 152                                                                 AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


   thorough research to determine the cause of the discrepancy. Before processing the IAD
   package, consider the following conditions to determine the proper process for the IAD
   package:
       7.14.4.1. Assets adjusted from accountable records which are later recovered, but have a
       zero balance in base stock, will be picked up on record using ORG TIN procedures IAW
       paragraph 7.12.2. In this case, ensure mandatory documents outlined in paragraph
       7.14.5 and the Transaction History Listing (AM903) showing the ORG TIN to correct the
       account balance are added to the original IAD package.
       7.14.4.2. Assets discovered that are not on record, have an unknown origin, and have a
       zero balance in base stock, will be picked up on record using Found on Base (FOB) turn-
       in criteria listed in paragraph 7.12.6. In this case, the mandatory documents outlined in
       paragraph 7.14.5 must be included in the IAD package, as well as a Transaction History
       Listing (AM903) showing that the FOB turn-in was processed to correct the account
       balance.
       7.14.4.3. If discrepancy items do not meet either of the above criteria, process an IAD to
       place items on record. Whether processing an ORG TIN, FOB turn-in, or an IAD to
       place items onto accountable record must be supported in the same manner required to
       support adjustment of assets off of accountable record.
   7.14.5. The Inventory Adjustment Document (IAD) Package. (T-1). The Munitions
   Operations element notifies the MASO of the discrepancy and prepares the IAD package
   which includes:
NOTE: Movements processed using the CAS Movement Process (AM104A) to correct asset
locations when no overall balance discrepancy exists does not require an IAD package.
       7.14.5.1. A memorandum endorsed by the MASO and Munitions Supervision providing
       a concise description of the IAD package. EXAMPLE: The description could indicate
       that an inventory was performed (if necessary), research was conducted, and a statement
       describing any evidence found indicating that a loss resulted from negligence, fraud, or
       theft.
       7.14.5.2. IAD Supporting Documentation:        Attach the following documents to the
       memorandum:
          7.14.5.2.1. Applicable CAS Transaction History (AM903) record.
          7.14.5.2.2. Inventory Count Sheets (for all types of inventories).
          7.14.5.2.3. Memorandum from MASO (stock), Commander (custody), or a CAS
          DR/SAN from the CAS PMO (CAS issue/problem ) that describes the corrective
          actions taken to prevent recurrence.
          7.14.5.2.4. Memorandum from the commander (or equivalent) approving or denying
          relief of accountability for adjustments that result in losses from a custody account.
          7.14.5.2.5. If applicable, include the following documents in the IAD package:
              7.14.5.2.5.1. DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss.
              7.14.5.2.5.2. AFTO Form 102, Munitions Inspection Document or signed
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                     153


            accountable document.
            7.14.5.2.5.3. DD Form 114, Military Pay Order.
            7.14.5.2.5.4. DD Form 362, Statement of Charges/Cash Collection Voucher.
            7.14.5.2.5.5. DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher.
            7.14.5.2.5.6. DD Form 361, Transportation Discrepancy Report (TDR).
            7.14.5.2.5.7. SF 364, Report of Discrepancy (ROD) or WebSDR equivalent.
            7.14.5.2.5.8. A discrepancy investigation statement with copies of erroneous
            documents which could not be processed as an RVP.
            7.14.5.2.5.9. Aircraft mishap report or a memorandum signed by the MXG or OG
            commander as authority for relief.
            7.14.5.2.5.10. AF IMT 1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness/Complaint (when a
            loss is reportable IAW DoD 5100.76-M).
  7.14.6. IAD Package Review. (T-1). Munitions Operations personnel brief the MASO on
  the IAD package. The MASO ensures the IAD package includes sufficient justification, and
  forwards the IAD package to the MUNS Superintendent or Munitions Flight Chief/Flight
  Commander.
     7.14.6.1. The MUNS Superintendent or Munitions Flight Chief/Flight Commander
     reviews and evaluates the IAD package to determine if flight processes and operating
     instructions require revision. After concerns are resolved, the MUNS Superintendent or
     Munitions Flight Chief/Flight Commander initials the IAD package and forwards back to
     the MASO.
     7.14.6.2. The NCOIC of Munitions Operations (or equivalent) prepares the IAD package
     for MASO approval or prepares the IAD package for MASO certification and approval
     by the MASO appointing authority as follows:
         7.14.6.2.1. An IAD that requires an ROS for relief of accountability will be certified
         by the MASO and approved by the MASO appointing authority.
         7.14.6.2.2. An IAD that does not require an ROS, will be certified by the NCOIC of
         Munitions Operations (or equivalent) and approved by the MASO. The MASO may
         not delegate authority to approve inventory adjustments. If the MASO is not
         available, the MASO appointing authority will approve adjustments that do not
         require an ROS.
  7.14.7. IAD Package Approval. (T-1). Depending on the IAD situation, the MASO or
  MASO appointing authority approves the IAD package indicating that they:
     7.14.7.1. Are aware of the discrepancies reflected in the IAD package.
     7.14.7.2. Approval of the actions taken to resolve the discrepancy and prevent
     recurrence.
     7.14.7.3. If the MASO appointing authority does not approve the IAD package, the
     MASO will ensure additional research/actions are taken to mitigate the concerns to obtain
 154                                                                AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


       approval or initiate a DD Form 200 if additional research does not satisfactorily explain
       any discrepancies.
NOTE: Except as noted in paragraph 7.14.6.2.2, ensure written approval is obtained from the
MASO appointing authority prior to processing an Inventory Adjustment Transaction (AM427J)
in CAS.
       7.14.7.4. After the IAD package is approved, process the Inventory Adjustment
       Transaction (AM427J) in CAS and attach a copy of the approval and Inventory
       Adjustment document to the IAD package.
       7.14.7.5. At ANG bases/units, forward all approved IAD packages to the USP&FO or
       Assistant USP&FO for signature.
   7.14.8. IAD Package Filing. (T-1).        Electronically file the final IAD package IAW
   Attachment 6.
7.15. Reports of Survey (ROS) Procedures. (T-0). Refer to AFMAN 23-220, Reports of
Survey for Air Force Property for ROS processing format, procedures, timelines, and approval
levels. Once the IAD is processed and the inventory is “closed” in CAS, the ROS and Inventory
Adjustment Package may remain open pending “final” approval of the ROS. Additionally,
follow the below procedures for CAS-managed assets:
   7.15.1. NWRM. Refer to AFI 20-110.
   7.15.2. Mandatory ROS Criteria. Whether or not a loss meets ROS criteria, an ROS must
   be completed if negligence, willful misconduct or deliberate unauthorized use of munitions is
   suspected or when the loss involves the following CIICs:
       7.15.2.1. CIIC 1 – Very High Risk (Risk Category I).
       7.15.2.2. CIIC 5 – Secret (Risk Category I).
       7.15.2.3. CIIC 6 – Confidential (Risk Category I).
       7.15.2.4. CIIC 2 – High Risk (Risk Category II).
       7.15.2.5. CIIC 8 – Confidential (Risk Category II).
       7.15.2.6. CIIC T – Top Secret (Risk Category II).
       7.15.2.7. CIIC S – Secret (Risk Category III).
       7.15.2.8. CIIC C – Confidential (Risk Category IV).
       7.15.2.9. In addition to the mandatory ROS criteria above, you must submit a ROS for
       all adjustments to balances of stock and custody account assets unless the adjustment
       meets one of the following conditions:
          7.15.2.9.1. DoDAAC Stock Assets: One-time loss of less than 200 items valued at
          $1,000 or less total.
          7.15.2.9.2. Custody Accounts: One-time loss of CIIC 3 (moderate risk) munitions of
          20 or fewer items whose total- value is $200 or less.
          7.15.2.9.3. Custody Accounts: One-time loss of a CIIC 4 and 7 (low risk) or U
          (unclassified) munitions of 200 or fewer items whose total value is $250 or less.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                     155


  7.15.3. One-Time Losses. As used in the instances above, a “one-time” loss means each
  incident will be treated (reported and resolved) individually. In other words, you cannot
  group months or weeks’ worth of losses and justify them under a single document. On the
  other hand, a “one-time loss” does not mean that you will automatically initiate a ROS the
  second time an account loses munitions. Commanders and munitions managers must
  evaluate each incident/loss within the overall context of asset accountability. A pattern of
  irresponsibility or lack of adequate inventory controls is grounds for either freezing the
  custody account or initiating a ROS.
  7.15.4. Small arms Ammunition Combat Consumption (SmACC) Issues. An IAD or
  ROS is not required for SmACC issues when processed IAW paragraph 7.10.2.3.1. These
  assets are considered “consumed” when issued. If assets are subsequently returned process
  an appropriate TIN (e.g., FOB; expenditure) IAW paragraph 7.12.
  7.15.5. Combat Losses/Aircraft Accidents. Do not submit a ROS for losses resulting from
  aircraft accidents and property lost during combat operations. Use the aircraft mishap report
  or a memorandum signed by the OG or MXG commander as authority for inventory
  adjustment. A copy of the report or memorandum will be filed with the inventory adjustment
  document.
  7.15.6. Commander Discretion. Except for mandatory ROS requirements, commanders
  may elect to process an ROS regardless of required criteria or allow individuals to pay for a
  loss in lieu of a ROS.
     7.15.6.1. The costs of processing an ROS for small dollar losses may exceed any amount
     recovered. However, because of the sensitivity of munitions items, emphasis is placed on
     accountability rather than economy or efficiency.
     7.15.6.2. Payment in Lieu of ROS: The organizational commander of the account may
     allow the responsible individual to pay for the loss in lieu of a ROS, IAW AFMAN 23-
     220. In this case, the commander will provide the MASO with one of the financial forms
     listed in paragraph 7.14.5.2.5 to support the inventory adjustment. This does not relieve
     the commander from evaluating the account and establishing procedures to prevent future
     losses.
  7.15.7. Use of the ROS. The completed ROS is used to substantiate adjustment of the
  DoDAAC stock balance, to recommend corrective action, and to determine the financial
  responsibility of the accountable officer or any other person involved in the discrepancy.
     7.15.7.1. Once an ROS number has been assigned, the certifying official (MASO) and
     appointing authority (MASO Appointment Authority) are authorized to sign the
     incomplete inventory adjustment package. This provides written approval to process the
     inventory adjustment and close out the inventory in CAS.
     7.15.7.2. Whether or not an ROS is required, the inventory adjustment records must
     clearly identify and include all information relating to the stockpile discrepancy and
     support the adjustment as a “stand alone” package. This package will complete the audit
     trail through documents identified in paragraph 7.12.1.2 to support the inventory
     adjustment.
 156                                                                 AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


   7.15.8. Damage and/or Destruction: The ROS and IAD requirements described above
   apply to munitions on the DoDAAC stock account or custody accounts which are damaged
   or destroyed for reasons other than fair wear and tear, authorized expenditure, aircraft loss,
   installation, or disposition. The accountable officer or account custodian is liable for damage
   or destruction until relieved of accountability.
7.16. Test/Contract Munitions Management. (T-1).
   7.16.1. General Guidance. Munitions assets received in support of Research and
   Development (R&D) tests, to include non-Air Force owned munitions assets, may be
   managed on DoDAAC stock, issued, and controlled by procedures in this AFI.
   Accountability, safety, and security of R&D assets not owned by the Air Force but in the
   physical possession of Air Force activities are enhanced by Accountable CAS management.
   Units supporting RTD&E activities with non-DoD or foreign munitions and explosives will
   ensure storage is approved IAW AFMAN 91-201 and/or authorized/excepted IAW AFI 32-
   9003, Granting Temporary Use of Air Force Real Property. If these publications do not
   provide approval or exception, forward all requests to store non-DoD explosives to the
   appropriate waiver authority for consideration.
       7.16.1.1. AFMC/A4M will serve as the guidance approval authority for the
       accountability of Laboratory Developed Explosive test samples. AFMC/A4M will
       develop and coordinate procedures supporting 96th Test Group test operations with the
       host unit Maintenance Group commander (or equivalent) and the host MAJCOM
       munitions staff.
       7.16.1.2. When a SPO and/or Responsible Test Officer (RTO) acquires RDT&E
       munitions assets outside of the normal munitions procurement, requisitioning, and
       allocation process/channels through program baseline funding or any other means, they
       become the owner of the RDT&E munitions assets. When in the possession of Air Force
       activities, manage assets procured outside of normal channels in CAS IAW paragraph
       5.2.22.2.
          7.16.1.2.1. The owning SPO and/or Responsible Test Officer (RTO) must coordinate
          with the owning MAJCOM munitions staff and local MASO, prior to shipping
          SPO/RTO owned assets to the munitions unit. This coordination is required to ensure
          proper munitions management and effective munitions support.
          7.16.1.2.2. When properly coordinated, munitions received by the munitions unit in
          support of RDT&E will be picked up on the DoDAAC stock account in CAS within 5
          duty days after receipt. The MASO will immediately contact MAJCOM if assets are
          received without prior coordination.
          7.16.1.2.3. Control and management of SPO/RTO program owned munitions assets
          rest exclusively with these officials. Therefore, the SPO/RTO will ensure the MASO
          is provided with current and accurate program ownership support documentation in
          the form of contract purchase order, GPC purchase order, or MIPR. This
          documentation is critical to ensure appropriate ownership and responsibility of these
          items is not lost. The MASO will maintain this documentation for management and
          audit purposes.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                      157


        7.16.1.2.4. When a SPO, RTO, Test Program Manager (TPM), or PM purchase stock
        listed or non-stock listed munitions assets to support tests, they become responsible to
        act as the IM and MUFM for these assets.
        7.16.1.2.5. During procurement of R&D assets, the SPO/RTO will request technical
        data, MSDS, IHC, chemical constituency data, and disposal data for these assets. The
        SPO/RTO must provide this information and related data to the TPM/PM and the
        MASO at the receiving and storing activity prior to shipping the assets.
     7.16.1.3. The MASO must load levels for RDT&E assets in CAS. The SPO and/or RTO
     authorize loading or adjusting RDT&E levels in CAS by providing the MASO with
     copies of documents that validate test requirements by program (e.g., clearly marked for
     the program). These levels will be validated in conjunction with the MASO semi-annual
     account review for assets maintained on stockpile and during the MASO annual Custody
     inventory for assets Custody issued. Applicable test directive, test program plan, contract
     purchase order, Government Purchase Card (GPC) purchase order, MIPR, or active
     AFMC Job Order Number will be maintained by the MASO for audit purposes.
        7.16.1.3.1. All SPO/RTO owned munitions assets assigned local stock numbers in
        CAS must include an appropriately assigned CIIC. Installation Resource Protection
        Managers may be able to help if the appropriate CIIC is not readily determined.
        7.16.1.3.2. Upon completion of an R&D test project, AF owned assets remaining on
        the test accounts will be turned-in to the MSA DoDAAC stock account. The test PM
        or program office is responsible for coordinating with the appropriate SPO/RTO to
        determine if the assets are no longer required or cannot be utilized for future test
        projects.
            7.16.1.3.2.1. If test assets are required at another installation, the test PM or
            program office will coordinate with the SPO/RTO to provide the MASO with
            movement guidance/instructions. Assets purchased by specific programs outside
            of normal allocation process must include a funding line to pay for transportation
            as program owned assets are not covered under SDT requirements.
            7.16.1.3.2.2. If these test assets are serviceable and the SPO/RTO no longer
            requires the assets for test purposes, the MASO will report them as serviceable
            excess via the automated serviceable excess program on the GACP website IAW
            paragraph 3.12.12.
            7.16.1.3.2.3. If test assets are unserviceable for general operational/training use
            IAW technical data, the SPO/RTO no longer requires the assets for test purposes,
            and the assets are stock listed, the MASO will submit an ADR IAW paragraph
            3.12.14 For test assets purchased outside of the normal allocation process, the
            SPO/RTO must provide the MASO a funding line to pay for demilitarization or
            transportation. Program owned assets are not covered under SDT requirements.
            7.16.1.3.2.4. Contractors are responsible to dispose of contractor owned R&D
            assets. The program office is responsible to ensure a funding line is provided to

           7.16.1.3.3. If an unsafe situation develops with test munitions, base commanders (or
           equivalent), in coordination with EOD, may approve the destruction of a munitions or
           explosive item that constitutes an immediate danger to human life or property IAW
           Level 1 disposition procedures of paragraph 3.12. The appropriate test PM shall
           notify the program office of the emergency disposition of assets not allocated through
           the normal allocation process or emergency disposition of contractor owned assets
           within 48 hours after disposition.
   7.16.2. Forecasting for Test/Contract Munitions. Test munitions for which there is a
   suitable AF stock listed asset available must be forecasted/allocated annually.
       7.16.2.1. OOCR for tests will be submitted to the MASO for review. If the MASO
       cannot provide an allocation for the OOCR, the MASO must then forward the request to
       the MAJCOM MUFM for review and resolution.
       7.16.2.2. If the MUFM cannot provide an allocation, the MUFM will then forward the
       request to the Air Staff functional office for resolution.
       7.16.2.3. Test organizations must forecast for all serviceable CAS-managed
       components/munitions (fins, impulse cartridges, etc.) needed to support test project
       requirements involving other munitions. Preliminary or interim T.O. guidance must be
       provided IAW T.O. 00-5-3 and AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle
       Management. Nonstandard munitions received without sufficient documentation (e.g.,
       technical data) constitutes a potential safety hazard to both facilities and personnel. If
       received without required documentation, the receiving unit will impound those
       munitions and place them in CC-J (suspended from issued, true condition unknown) until
       required documentation is received.
       7.16.2.4. All stock-listed and non-stock listed munitions and components required in
       conjunction with an item that can be forecasted must be supplied by the SPO/RTO.
       Components will not be supplied from other allocations without OOCR approved by the
       MAJCOM and AF/A4LW (ground munitions) or AF/A5R-C (air munitions).
PART III
OPERATIONAL MUNITIONS
Part III of this instruction implements conventional munitions policy, procedure, and guidance
for MAJCOM (e.g., Lead, Supported, Component, Non Component, and No Component), NAF,
CMAs (e.g., GACP). The operational level includes all HQ and CMA activities at the
MAJCOM and below, at home station and deployed, that support of strategic objectives, execute
operational level tasks, and enable execution of tactical level munitions operations. This
includes munitions systems employment or other support operations (e.g., war-fighting support,
APF loading/discharge, air/sea-port operations, STAMP outload, theater/regional positioning,
inland transportation, planning, depot support, training/force development, manpower,
infrastructure). Operational level munitions activity also includes sustainment of
munition/missile system employment, logistical reachback; and forecasting, allocating,
distributing, and managing operational requirements. At the operational level, munitions activity
is executed by rear-echelon units to plan, manage, equip and project munitions forces to
accomplish military objectives.

                 MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES

8.1. Introduction. Lead Command designations outlined in AFPD 10-9, Lead Command
Designation and Responsibilities For Weapon Systems primarily apply to Weapons Systems
Management and Sustainment activities. For the purposes of AFI 21-201 and Conventional
Munitions Management, Lead Command designations are aligned differently to appropriately
reflect essential and necessary HQ Technical Munitions Systems Management, CMA functions,
and roles. AFI 21-201 Lead Command designations have no impact on traditional Organize,
Train, and Equip (OTE) function inherent in all MAJCOMs. The following reachback
relationships will be used:
   8.1.1. For long-term munitions system management and sustainment issues, wings/groups
   work directly with Lead Commands and CMAs, and share information with the MAJCOM
   and/or NAF.
   8.1.2. Munitions contingency planning and execution occurs through the MAJCOM and/or
   NAF with reachback to the Lead Command and the GACP. Day-to-day munitions technical
   and system management issues will be addressed to the Lead Command and the GACP, and
   share information with the MAJCOM/NAF.
   8.1.3. Lead Commands and the GACP provide staff support covering duty hours of both
   Lead and Supported MAJCOMs/NAFs.
   8.1.4. Lead Commands and the GACP coordinate technical support and provide guidance on
   issues beyond unit capabilities through the T.O. waiver process, technical data assistance
   requests and through reachback to supported agencies.

                    CONVENTIONAL MUNITIONS MANAGEMENT

9.1. Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC).
   9.1.1. AFMC/A4MW is the focal point for munitions DoDAACs. A DoDAAC as used in
   this instruction refers to active or contingency munitions accounts.
   9.1.2. An installation may maintain more than one conventional munitions account when
   separate storage areas/facilities exist on the same installation (i.e., War Reserve Stock for
   Allies). Requests for additional DoDAACs will clearly indicate why it is in the best interest
   of the Air Force.
   9.1.3. ANG and AFR organizations may establish a DoDAAC at any installation where the
   ANG or AFR maintains an active munitions operation.
   9.1.4. Establishing a DoDAAC.         Lead Commands, ARC, and NAFs will request
   establishment, change, or deletion of a DoDAAC IAW AFI 24-230, Maintaining Air Force
   DoD Activity Address Codes (DoDAAC).
      9.1.4.1. Submit requests on-line through the DoDAAC Web Management System
      specified in paragraph 1.4.9. Select “Request DoDAAC”, “Change DoDAAC”, or
      “Delete DoDAAC” (if applicable).
      9.1.4.2. Maintain accuracy of DoDAAC information by updating CAS or other
      applicable systems and coordinating changes with the DoDAAC monitor identified in the
      DoDAAC        Web    Management       System.        After   DoDAAC       has   been
      established/changed/deleted, submit addition/change/deletion information to the CAS
      PMO.
      9.1.4.3. If a location is controlled or classified, classify the request appropriately.
      Controlled addresses are published with “controlled” as the clear text address. The Lead
      Command, ARC, and NAFs will maintain a classified list of their controlled DoDAACs
      and provide this listing to AF/A4LW, AF/A5R-C, and the GACP whenever updates are
      accomplished.
9.2. Combat Ammunition System (CAS) Administration. CAS is an unclassified system
IAW DoDI 8510.01, DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process
(DIACAP). Tivoli Access Manager Groups are assigned to every individual with access to CAS
IAW Table 9.1, Tivoli CAS Groups and assign permissions using the CAS User Administration
(AMA01A).
   9.2.1. CAS Access (T-1). All personnel requiring access to CAS must submit a DD Form
   2875, System Authorization Access Request (SAAR) IAW AFMAN 33-282 and these
   instructions. Submit the DD Form 2875 to the appropriate SA for routing and approval.
      9.2.1.1. Base level personnel obtain access to CAS IAW paragraph 2.6.6.
      9.2.1.2. CAS Program Management Office (PMO), munitions/missile System Program

 184                                                                AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


          9.2.1.2.1. The requestor (e.g., user) will complete Part I (blocks 1-13) of the DD
          Form 2875 and forward to their supervisor.
          9.2.1.2.2. The supervisor will verify Part I and complete Part II (blocks 14-20b) and
          forward to the unit/organization/Local SA.
NOTE: Justification for CAS access will be based on the unit/organizational mission, assigned
tasks/duties, and responsibilities; site applicable polices and technical directives.
          9.2.1.2.3. The unit/organization/Local SA (as applicable) is the base level
          Information Owner for CAS and will validate Part I and complete Part II (blocks 21-
          25). The unit/organization/Local SA will sign block 21 and 22 of the DD Form 2875
          approving CAS access and forward to Unit Security Manager.
NOTE: If a MASO is assigned to the DoDAAC, the MASO will block 21 of the DD Form 2875
as the information owner approving CAS access.
NOTE: Program Managers will sign Part II (block 21) for PMO and SPO personnel.
          9.2.1.2.4. The Unit Security Manager will sign the form validating the background
          investigation and security clearance data. The Security Manager forwards to the
          unit/organization/Local SA for processing.
          9.2.1.2.5. The unit/organization/Local SA will grant CAS access through Tivoli
          Access Manager utilizing the groups in Table 9.1 and assign permissions using the
          CAS User Administration (AMA01A) program to designate specific programs for
          individual user access. The unit/organization/Local SA will then complete Part IV of
          the DD Form 2875 and sign under “Processed By”.
          9.2.1.2.6. The CAS PMO Information Assurance Manager (IAM) will maintain an
          organizational e-mail account for SAs from the CAS-PMO, munitions SPOs, HQ
          Staffs, and GACP to e-mail their coordinated and completed DD Forms 2875.
          9.2.1.2.7. The organization’s/unit’s Local SA submitting the DD Form 2875 to the
          CAS PMO IAM will maintain the completed DD Form 2875 on official records IAW
          the AFRIMS RDS.
          9.2.1.2.8. The unit/organization/Local SA is responsible to remove an individual’s
          access to CAS when access is no longer required. It is not necessary to notify the
          CAS PMO when an individual no longer requires CAS access due to personnel
          reassignments or separations.
   9.2.2. System Administration (SA) Levels. There are four levels of CAS SA roles. These
   levels and roles are: CAS SPO (Functional SA), GACP SA, MAJCOM SA, and the LOCAL
   SA. Depending upon their level of authorization, the SA has the capability to add, change, or
   delete a CAS user from the system at their level or below. Based on an approved DD Form
   2875, the SA has assigns permissions to each user for the programs and/or functional areas
   that may be accessed. In order for the menu to be created dynamically upon user login, the
   SA must assign permissions using the CAS User Administration (AMA01A) program to
   designate specific programs for individual user access.
       9.2.2.1. The CAS SPO role assigns CAS roles to all levels of CAS personnel. The
       assignment of the ADMIN role will be accomplished using a tiered method where the
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                    185


     CAS SPO will have overall authority. The CAS SPO is responsible for assigning the
     CAS-ADMIN-MAJCOM group in Tivoli to MAJCOM SAs, who in-turn are responsible
     for assigning the CAS-ADMIN-BASE group in Tivoli to the Local SA at
     installations/bases within their MAJCOM domain. When the SA is assigned the
     CAS_ADMIN group they have the ability to assign the CAS_USER group to anyone at
     their level and below.
     9.2.2.2. CAS Functional System Administrator (FSA) Level. These individuals are
     assigned to the CAS PMO and are responsible for the administration of the CAS
     application database. These FSAs will act as the intermediaries for the Defense
     Information Systems Agency and the CAS functional users. If a problem arises where a
     database recovery would be required, the FSA will inform DISA of the need for recovery
     of the database.
  9.2.3. Appointment of the MAJCOM SA. The MAJCOM A4W (or equivalent) will
  appoint a primary and alternate MAJCOM CAS SA in writing to include name, rank,
  DoDAAC, unit, office symbol, DSN phone number, portal login ID, and security clearance.
  (T-2).
     9.2.3.1. Forward a copy of the appointment memorandum to the CAS PMO. (T-2).
     9.2.3.2. When the primary or alternate SA is relieved of his/her duties, a new
     appointment memorandum must be accomplished identifying the successor and will
     reference the superseded memorandum. (T-2).
     9.2.3.3. Validate the appointment memorandum for currency annually. (T-2).
     9.2.3.4. Ensure the SA is briefed on specific computer training and awareness issues as
     outlined in AFI 33-200. (T-1).
     9.2.3.5. The SA will complete the DD Form 2875 as outlined in paragraph 9.2.1.
     9.2.3.6. Upon receipt and validation of the appointment memorandum the CAS PMO
     will assign the CAS ADMIN-MAJCOM role to the MAJCOM SA identified in the
     memorandum and DD Form 2875.
        9.2.3.6.1. Once the ADMIN-MAJCOM role is assigned to the MAJCOM SA and
        appears in the SA's Air Force Portal, he or she will then be able to access the AF
        portal link. This will not grant access to the CAS application. The MAJCOM SA
        will then have to be loaded to the CAS application using the Admin menu, User
        Management option in the application software to be able to access the application
        software.
     9.2.3.7. MAJCOM SA: Point of contact (POC) for all matters relating to the CAS
     application for users assigned to the bases they support.
        9.2.3.7.1. Based on coordinated and approved DD Forms 2875, the MAJCOM SA
        provides administrative privilege to trusted users in order to perform SA functions at
        locations within the MAJCOM domain. The primary or alternate MAJCOM SA is
        granted unique roles; therefore, as a minimum, one of the appointed administrators
        must be available to support daily CAS operations. By granting access, the SA is
        entrusting the security of the system to individuals assigned. The MAJCOM SA can
   186                                                                 AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


             load CAS roles to MAJCOM users and base users within their command in the
             application software.
             9.2.3.7.2. The MAJCOM SA grants the primary and alternate base level SA the CAS
             ADMIN privilege if the local administrator’s GCSS-AF Integrated Framework logins
             are assigned and the appointment memorandum and DD Form 2875 has been
             received and validated. If no local SA is assigned/available, the MAJCOM SA grants
             base level SA in their absence.

     9.3.1. CAS is the Air Force’s munitions accounting and reporting system and the source for
     reporting munitions asset data.
     9.3.2. Manual reporting of munitions data in any format is discouraged. CAS provides
     worldwide visibility of AF munitions assets and shall be used at every level.
     9.3.3. AF/A5R-C provides the priority build sequence to the GACP. This build sequence
     will be the basis for prioritizing worldwide and theater level CR munitions data in CAS.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                        187


   9.3.4. Theater planners, MAJCOMs, NAFs, and units develop tailored and unique build
   sequences for prioritizing CR munitions data to facilitate combat planning and forecasting.
9.4. CAS-managed Material.
   9.4.1. Items meeting the definition of AFPD 21-2, Munitions and AFI 21-200 will be
   managed using CAS for the purpose of Air Force accountability, reporting, requisitioning,
   transportation, inventory control, and maintaining related IDR.
      9.4.1.1. Items will not be managed in CAS or by the MASO for local operational or
      functional convenience.
      9.4.1.2. If there is a question whether an item is managed in CAS, contact the GACP via
      the CRM.
      9.4.1.3. AF/A4LW makes final determinations on non-explosive and inert items, or may
      designate other items/assets to be managed in CAS to meet operational or supply chain
      requirements.
   9.4.2. Any item considered for CAS management by an IM or system manager must obtain
   approval by the appropriate functional manager below:
      9.4.2.1. AF/A4LW for air-munitions, strategic missile components, NWRM, associated
      munitions/ explosive assets, and specific designated equipment items.
      9.4.2.2. The Air Force Security Forces Center (AFSFC/SFXW) for ground munitions.
      9.4.2.3. The Air Force Civil Engineering Center (AFCEC/CXD) for explosive
      demolition materials.
   9.4.3. The FSC and stock number of an item do not in themselves determine the system of
   supply management (i.e., CAS or SBSS) or whether an item is a munitions asset. End item
   usage, hazard characteristics, maintenance characteristics, security/sensitivity, supply chain,
   and source of supply are the primary considerations.
   9.4.4. Annually, 30 calendar days prior to the end of year stockpile reconciliation closeout,
   the GACP will access the Air Force Supply Central Data Base (AFSCDB) Discoverer
   application to perform query operations from the legacy SBSS to determine if munitions
   managed assets are on Air Force Base Supply records.
      9.4.4.1. To gain access to AFSCDB, the GACP submits DD Form 2875 to the Hill AFB
      Base Supply activity (75 LRS/LGRMLM).
      9.4.4.2. If munitions assets are identified or suspected to be on SBSS records, they will
      notify the DoDAAC to take appropriate action with base supply to research these assets
      and transfer assets from the FB to FV account.
   9.4.5. Annually, 30 calendar days prior to the end of year stockpile reconciliation closeout,
   the GACP will perform query operations in CAS/AMST to determine if supply managed
   assets are on Air Force munitions accountable records. If supply assets are identified or
   suspected to be on munitions accountable records, the GACP will notify the DoDAAC to
   take appropriate action with base supply to research these assets and transfer assets from the
   FV to FB account.
 188                                                                  AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014

   authority in resolution of any remaining issues between the services.
   9.5.5. If redistribution of munitions is requested or required during joint operations (exercise
   or contingency), the MAJCOM/NAF TACP/RACP or Lead Command establishes and
   coordinates requirements with AF/A5R-C (air-munitions) or AF/A4LW (ground munitions).
       9.5.5.1. Air Force air munitions will not be released to agencies outside the AF without
       AF/A5R-C approval. Air Force ground munitions will not be released to agencies
       outside the AF without AF/A4LW approval. SOF unique Major Force Program (MFP)-
       11 air and ground munitions will not be released to agencies outside the AF or non-
       AFSOC AF units without AFSOC/A4 approval.
       9.5.5.2. Munitions may be released to agencies performing contracted Air Force
       functions (i.e., EOD, SFS, range clearing etc.) only when the munitions requirements
       have been validated by the MUFM with responsibility for that functional area.
       9.5.5.3. Contractors may be custody account custodians if an Air Force organizational

   State laws and regulations establish requirements for management and disposal of WMM.
   Applicable federal law includes the MMR (40 C.F.R., Subpart M).
   9.7.2. ALC Product Group Managers will conduct an annual stockpile analysis to identify
   serviceable excess assets following requirements determination through the NCAA process.
   Disposition of serviceable excess assets will be determined during the TAMP and DLAR
   processes and prioritized for movement in the annual MMP.
   9.7.3. The Product Group Managers directs redistribution via a RDO of excess serviceable
   items to satisfy worldwide requirements. These RDOs will be coordinated with the
   Lead/Supported MAJCOM or NAF.
   9.7.4. PGMs shall receive and process ADRs via the automated ADR system on the GACP
   website.
       9.7.4.1. The PGM will establish a central ADR processing function to ensure alternative
       uses of reported munitions are fully considered before authorizing disposal of non-
       hazardous munitions.
       9.7.4.2. Processing function personnel should be experienced in munitions manufacture,
       use, storage/transportation, inspection, accountability, and stockpile management.
       9.7.4.3. The appropriate AF DDA will provide disposition instructions within 60
       calendar days after receipt of an ADR. These instructions may direct shipment of non-
       hazardous munitions to any of the following locations: A base from a different
       MAJCOM; a storage location; a repair/recovery/ recycling facility; an Army or Navy
       location; a FMS destination; or (as a last resort) a TTU.
       9.7.4.4. The AF DDA will maintain a record of all ADRs IAW with the AF RDS in
       AFRIMS to provide details of individual evaluations upon request.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                      191


  9.7.5. The Product Group Managers, GACP, Hill AFB, and Robins AFB are the AF DDAs
  for the Air Force. The SMCA is the DoD DDA.
     9.7.5.1. As defined in the MMR, they are the only persons who are authorized to identify
     military munitions items as WMM.
     9.7.5.2. Hazardous munitions items designated by EOD as Level 1 or Level 2 do not
     require AF DDA approval prior to emergency disposal.
     9.7.5.3. Munitions found off base and declared “ROUTINE” and have an unknown
     storage history, or are rendered/declared safe by EOD, will be evaluated from a storage
     and transportation aspect by the appropriate AF DDA for disposition determination.
     9.7.5.4. Appropriate production lot suspension or restriction actions must be assessed or
     initiated by the PT/IPT through the appropriate ES or PM after disposal actions/decisions.
     9.7.5.5. The PT/IPT will take prompt action to advise users that the lot has been
     restricted or suspended in CMRS.
  9.7.6. The AF DDA will coordinate with PM for military munitions acquisition programs
  and the Director, DLA, to establish demilitarization requirements for MPPEH, MDEH, and
  MDAS. DoDI 4140.62 requires PMs for military munitions acquisition programs to ensure
  that the program’s planning, design, and implementation include MPPEH requirements to:
     9.7.6.1. Document the expected level of explosive residue and other munitions
     constituents that remain on used or demilitarized military munitions (e.g., cartridge
     casings).
     9.7.6.2. For MPPEH generated from munitions use, to define specific demilitarization
     and disposal procedures that comply with applicable DoD explosives safety standards,
     trade security controls, and demilitarization requirements.
9.8. GACP COTS Procedures.
  9.8.1. Munitions System Management. Determination for management through the
  munitions system is made by the PM.
     9.8.1.1. This determination is based on the ability to assign an existing (like item) T.O.,
     obtain SPI, account for items through CAS, budgeting and procurement requirements,
     and the ability to provide disposition for unserviceable and excess items.
        9.8.1.1.1. Because munitions items are centrally procured assets, they are generally
        prohibited from local purchase. Units can be authorized to locally procure munitions
        items with PM approval, however, to do so, the PM must provide the procurement
        funds, therefore, the PM must consider provisions of AFI 65-601, Vol. 1, Budget
        Guidance and Procedures related to local purchase (LP) of centrally procured items
        when making these decisions.
        9.8.1.1.2. When the PM has approved a waiver for local purchase of centrally
        procured items, and the local base supply officer (MASO for munitions) approves the
        transaction, use customer funds for initial and follow-on procurement.
     9.8.1.2. If the PM determines requested munitions are not manageable within the
     munitions system, the request may proceed for IHC and NNMSB safety certification.
 192                                                               AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


   9.8.2. NNMSB Certification. COTS munitions purchase request data packages will be
   reviewed by GACP CMPM for completeness to provide the NNMSB with sufficient
   information to certify COTS munitions for Air Force use. If additional data is required,
   NNMSB member(s) will coordinate through GACP CMPM.
   9.8.3. HC includes assigning hazard class and division, compatibility group, UN number,
   and explosive weight. An IHC or HC must be assigned prior to placing munitions into
   operational service.
       9.8.3.1. The Air Force Safety Center assigns final HC for Air Force munitions upon
       completion of formal testing and/or analysis IAW T.O. 11A-1-47.
       9.8.3.2. IHC requests are submitted through the GACP website. An IHC will be issued
       for a period of one year. Extensions may be granted provided the requesting unit
       provides complete justification and has submitted data to the CMPM to obtain a final
       hazard classification.
       9.8.3.3. COTS munitions packages disapproved for IHC or final HC will be returned to
       the requesting unit. COTS munitions with expired IHC will not be used until revalidated
       or final HC is approved.
   9.8.4. Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program. The GACP and the NNMSB
   approves BASH munitions IAW paragraphs 7.3.8.5, 7.4.10.6, and 9.8.2.
9.9. Conventional Munitions Product Assurance Management.
   9.9.1. Life-Cycle Management Concept - Introduction. Product assurance concerns exist
   from the inception of a munitions item until it is properly disposed. With this in mind,
   personnel at all echelons are stakeholders in the process. This entails proper design, life
   cycle testing, the inspection process and reporting of discrepancies. These procedures are
   essential for establishing the foundation of product assurance for munitions.
       9.9.1.1. All higher headquarters and management activities with units that use
       conventional munitions items have product assurance duties:
          9.9.1.1.1. Assist and provide guidance to subordinate organizations to establish
          product assurance programs according to paragraph 3.1 and use PQDR, AFTO Form
          22, AFTO Form 102, or alternative electronic means to identify munitions reliability,
          maintainability, or deficiency concerns to the appropriate ALC.
          9.9.1.1.2. Screen safety and accident investigation reports and ensures any munitions
          issues are referred to the appropriate ALC.
          9.9.1.1.3. Ensure procedures to monitor and survey condition of munitions in storage
          and service are complied with.
          9.9.1.1.4. Evaluate skills and personnel who conduct product assurance and identify
          training requirements to the Career Field Manager (CFM) and AETC during the
          U&TW.
          9.9.1.1.5. Review reliability and maintainability reports from the ALCs and
          determine minimum acceptable performance criteria below which munitions have no
          identifiable combat utility. Coordinate with HAF and the responsible ALC to remove
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                       193


        from service and inventory, or restrict to training use only, those items that fall below
        established combat performance criteria.
        9.9.1.1.6. If charged with developing mission need statements, ensure to indicate
        assets must be made available for life-cycle testing. Also, incorporate design and
        inspection desires to ensure asset reliability while minimizing manpower impacts.
        9.9.1.1.7. Participate in forums and working groups to resolve product assurance
        problems.
        9.9.1.1.8. Assess the effectiveness of munitions product assurance programs during
        unit level surveillance visits.
     9.9.1.2. AFMC has the primary responsibility for munitions product assurance to
     include:
        9.9.1.2.1. Ensuring resource allocation to support product assurance commensurate
        with the importance of high quality and reliable munitions.
        9.9.1.2.2. Investigating munitions deficiencies reported by using commands and
        units. Report reliability and maintainability results from investigations and
        surveillance testing to using commands. The ALCs will establish tracking systems to
        monitor trends and analyze data. The ALCs will provide MAJCOMs and other
        customers with reports to provide results of the data analysis.
        9.9.1.2.3. Establishing, maintaining, and managing technical information and content
        for inspecting, testing, storing, maintaining, handling, transporting, packaging,
        preserving, disposing, reconditioning, modifying, renovating and containerizing
        conventional munitions.
        9.9.1.2.4. Ensuring surveillance is maintained over Air Force munitions stored by
        other Services. This includes ensuring the storing service is properly using allocated
        funds to store, inspect and maintain munitions.
        9.9.1.2.5. Conducting surveillance visits to other services’ storage sites containing
        Air Force assets every 2 years to determine the effectiveness of their munitions
        product assurance program. At the end of surveillance visit, conduct an out briefing
        with the other services’ representatives to discuss noted deficiencies. Furnish a
        detailed written report of the surveillance visit to the agencies responsible for storage
        site. Report will identify all deficiencies, their main causes, recommended changes,
        training requirements and personnel contacted during the visit. Furnish the Air Staff,
        Lead Commands and the ARC a copy of the written report on the status of the Air
        Force stockpile stored at other services’ sites.
  9.9.2. Product Design.
     9.9.2.1. Design Considerations.
        9.9.2.1.1. Product assurance for conventional munitions must begin during the
        conceptual phase of the acquisition process and be continued throughout the life-
        cycle of the item.
        9.9.2.1.2. Munitions agencies ensure consideration is given to the operating
        environment faced by munitions. Munitions are stockpiled for extended periods,
194                                                                AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


         withdrawn, and cycled from a ready state back to storage numerous times before
         finally being employed or disposed of. In the case of some munitions, electrical
         continuity tests or power-on operations may be a part of this cycling.
         9.9.2.1.3. Munitions require a dual consideration of reliability. Munitions must
         perform their mission on demand (performance) and must not function prematurely,
         inadvertently, or in some other unexpected manner (safety). Both aspects of
         reliability must be monitored and stringently controlled to ensure combat readiness is
         maintained and unintended personnel injury or property damage is prevented.
         9.9.2.1.4. Future maintenance requirements, such as component access for periodic
         inspection requirements, must be considered in the design stage. Additionally,
         adequate attention must be given to packaging, handling, storage, and transporting
         requirements, to include explosive HC for transportation and storage as well as the
         operational (ground handling/storage and flying) environment. Design criteria must
         also include environmental protection issues for consideration during daily use and
         for disposal purposes.
         9.9.2.1.5. Accurate configuration control of the items must be maintained. Changing
         NSNs of an item after modifications or TCTO changes promotes configuration
         control.
         9.9.2.1.6. Ensure throughout the munitions item life-cycle that accurate configuration
         control of the item engineering design is maintained.
         9.9.2.1.7. During design phase, consideration must be given to the future need to
         demilitarize/dispose of the item and, where possible, materials are selected that make
         this process easier. Lean towards reclamation potential as much as possible.
             9.9.2.1.7.1. AFMC implements Design for Demilitarization “DEMIL” (DFD) as
             an acquisition initiative into the systems engineering process for all newly
             developed ammunition items and those undergoing engineering changes or
             renovation and maintenance.
             9.9.2.1.7.2. Military Service material developers will follow guidance and best
             management practices provided by SMCA, to influence ammunition design in
             order to facilitate “DEMIL” operations. The goal is to increase resource recovery
             and recycling, reduced execution cost, minimized reuse/disposal costs, enhanced
             safety, and environmental compliance.
             9.9.2.1.7.3. Provide representatives from both the acquisition and “DEMIL”
             functional areas to participate in the DFD program.
         9.9.2.1.8. Provide Technical Data packages for newly fielded conventional
         ammunitions and components to allow characterization and development of DEMIL
         plans and technologies.
      9.9.2.2. Initial service life and shelf life dates for munitions are based on design,
      manufacturing processes, materials and performance testing.
  9.9.3. Product Assurance Procedures.
      9.9.3.1. Product Assurance Reporting.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                     195


        9.9.3.1.1. All munitions squadrons, flights, elements and munitions-using
        organizations have key product assurance responsibilities to formally report any/all
        conditions that could lead to injury or prevent a munitions item from functioning
        properly. Reporting methods are outlined in paragraph 3.1.1.2.
        9.9.3.1.2. Munitions-Managing Organizations.
            9.9.3.1.2.1. Report to munitions-using organizations by official e-mail anytime
            munitions items are placed into a suspended or restricted status.
            9.9.3.1.2.2. Report back to the submitting organization within 72 hours upon
            receipt of a PQDR. Acknowledge receipt of PQDR and provide any additional
            information regarding resolution of problem.
            9.9.3.1.2.3. If involved in the investigation of an accident or incident involving
            munitions, provide an initial assessment to other potential users of the asset.
     9.9.3.2. Munitions Inspections and Surveillance:
        9.9.3.2.1. Munitions activities and munitions-using organizations perform required
        inspections IAW paragraph 3.1.1.
        9.9.3.2.2. Munitions-Managing Organizations.
            9.9.3.2.2.1. Issue special and one-time inspection guidance and procedures as
            required.
            9.9.3.2.2.2. Ensure product assurance responsibilities are met for munitions items
            managed by other services.
     9.9.3.3. Mishap and Incident Investigations. The GACP maintains a MRRT of personnel
     knowledgeable in all aspects of munitions and capable of responding to munitions
     incidents. Procedures for contacting team are provided in paragraph 3.1.1.3.
     9.9.3.4. Testing. Most munitions are “one-shot” devices. Reliability for “one-shot”
     devices with time-dependent failure characteristics cannot be measured absolutely.
     Therefore, inferences must be made on reliability and useful life based on observing the
     performance of representative samples.
        9.9.3.4.1. Munitions-managing organizations ensure procurement of munitions items
        includes sufficient quantities for surveillance and aging testing throughout the
        forecast life-cycle of the item. Also ensure procurement includes sufficient assets for
        explosives safety and disposal testing.
        9.9.3.4.2. Ensure munitions test information and all available historical data (ADR,
        PQDR, CAS Inspection History, etc.) is used to periodically update munitions
        performance and reliability data and revise munitions inspection and surveillance
        intervals in appropriate technical data.
        9.9.3.4.3. Product Development Testing. Good documentation of item performance
        during product development testing is essential to long-term product assurance.
            9.9.3.4.3.1. Ensure explosive HC test data and detailed performance data are
            incorporated in munitions surveillance plans.
196                                                               AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


             9.9.3.4.3.2. Ensure Lot Acceptance Test data is captured and incorporated in
             surveillance plans.
         9.9.3.4.4. Surveillance Testing. Surveillance testing is intended to detect and
         measure the gradual changes in munitions before those changes cause the item and/or
         system to fail. Predicting future changes based on current measurements allows shelf
         life and service determinations. While operational tests and training events
         demonstrate whether a munitions system functioned or not, little useful surveillance
         information is usually obtained.
             9.9.3.4.4.1. Perform failure analysis testing if necessary to isolate causes of
             munitions failures and to determine if problem is widespread.
             9.9.3.4.4.2. Perform periodic testing of munitions to assess the impacts of aging
             on item reliability and performance. Testing should not only include those
             explosive components which suffer from chemical deterioration but any
             component of the munitions system which is critical to system operation and
             safety.
             9.9.3.4.4.3. Match test frequency to predicted item deterioration or to impact of
             item failure. When determining what munitions to test, consider high flight-hour
             accumulation of certain assets.
      9.9.3.5. Reliability Assessment and Product Deficiencies.
         9.9.3.5.1. Product Assurance Standards.
             9.9.3.5.1.1. Munitions-using and munitions-managing organizations establish
             performance and reliability standards during item development. Document the
             performance standards in Mission Needs Statements and CPD as well as
             surveillance test plans.
             9.9.3.5.1.2. If determined appropriate, negotiate product warranties and
             guarantees with the item developer. Manage the warranted item to ensure
             warranty conditions are not violated and conduct surveillance testing of the item
             prior to warranty expiration to insure it meets warranted standards.
         9.9.3.5.2. Product Assessment.
             9.9.3.5.2.1. Munitions-management organizations gather munitions performance
             information from all available sources in reaching a product reliability
             assessment.
             9.9.3.5.2.2. Compile information from munitions inspections conducted by both
             munitions-using and managing organizations.
             9.9.3.5.2.3. Ensure performance reports are received from operational evaluations
             of combat weapon systems and a solid review is conducted.
             9.9.3.5.2.4. PQDRs provide useful information about the failure modes of an item
             and organizations are required to use the PQDR process to identify munitions
             failures and discrepancies.
             9.9.3.5.2.5. Surveillance testing will continue to provide the bulk of product
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                       197


           assurance information and a test program must be conducted periodically
           throughout an item's service life.
        9.9.3.5.3. Product Analysis.
           9.9.3.5.3.1. Use actual test data when available for reliability determination and
           service life prediction.
           9.9.3.5.3.2. Long Range Services Life Analysis is a structural failure prediction
           model, which assists in establishing the service life of missile propulsion systems.
           Other computer models are coming into use to assist in determining reliability and
           service life of other conventional munitions items and their use is strongly
           encouraged.
           9.9.3.5.3.3. If product performance has changed, (e.g., range, accuracy, lethality,
           etc.) ensure using commands and the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals
           (JMEM) group are made aware of the current level of performance.
        9.9.3.5.4. Product Deficiency. When munitions are reported (through any means) to
        the PM or IM as deficient through inspection, testing, failure or any other means, a
        number of actions become possible.
           9.9.3.5.4.1. Item(s), S/N(s), or lot number(s) restriction or suspension.
               9.9.3.5.4.1.1. Restriction or suspension of a munitions item is usually an
               interim action until one or more of the actions listed in this chapter are taken
               to resolve the deficiency/suspected deficiency.
               9.9.3.5.4.1.2. Restrict an item when it does not conform to all specifications
               but is still serviceable for certain applications.
               9.9.3.5.4.1.3. Suspend an item when its true condition is not known, it is
               determined unserviceable, or its service life has expired. Additional
               information on CCs for munitions is contained in T.O. 11A-1-10.
           9.9.3.5.4.2. Warranty Action.
               9.9.3.5.4.2.1. If a deficient item was procured with a manufacturer's warranty,
               invoke the warranty.
               9.9.3.5.4.2.2. Ensure appropriate program management personnel are aware
               of warranty conditions and expiration dates.
           9.9.3.5.4.3. Accept deficiency - adjust service life. Occasionally the munitions-
           using and managing organizations will reach agreement that a munitions
           deficiency is too costly to correct, the asset is too mission-critical to restrict, or
           has insufficient impact on system performance to warrant correction.
               9.9.3.5.4.3.1. If appropriate, adjust the service life of the item or the use
               restriction code.
               9.9.3.5.4.3.2. If the deficiency changes the performance of a system, ensure

             organizations.
             9.9.3.5.4.5. Dispose or retire an item. Munitions items that have reached the end
             of their service life, as well as those of questionable reliability, must be retired
             from the inventory.
  9.9.4. Additional Product Assurance Responsibilities.
      9.9.4.1. Lead Command. All munitions items have a designated Lead Command.
      AFMC is the Lead Command for most munitions items, however, ACC, AFSOC, and
      AMC have specific Lead Command responsibilities for munitions due to Operational
      Test & Evaluation (OT&E) requirements for emerging systems and unique SOF or MAF
      requirements. These Lead Commands will:
         9.9.4.1.1. Ensure that munitions concerns are closely worked with the managing
         organization until resolution.
         9.9.4.1.2. Identify to the GACP, munitions items that are obsolete so disposition
         actions can be initiated.
      9.9.4.2. Munitions/Missile PIWGs are conducted by the Munitions Product Group IAW
      AFI 21-118, Improving Air and Space Equipment Reliability and Maintainability to
      improve product reliability and maintainability.        Minimum PIWG membership
      composition includes the single manager(s), system support manager(s), Lead Command
      Executive Agent, and a representative from each of using command.
  9.9.5. Requests to Modify Inspection Interval Requirements.
      9.9.5.1. Requests to change inspection/surveillance intervals for munitions items may
      require T.O. changes. Submit these requests using AFTO Form 22.
         9.9.5.1.1. Do not submit requests on items under warranty. Requests must be
         inclusive of the NSN and not individual lots or local storage or handling conditions.
         9.9.5.1.2. Requests will include Lead Command coordinated data and justification to
         increase or decrease in inspection or surveillance requirements. EXAMPLE:
         Surveillance interval data, quantity of items inspected, defects discovered, type of
         defects discovered, defect rates, number of ADRs submitted, number of PQDRs
         submitted, etc.
         9.9.5.1.3. Once coordinated by Lead Command munitions staffs, the Lead Command
         forwards the AFTO Form 22 to the GACP who will then forward the request to the
         appropriate office for evaluation. The ES will respond to these requests using normal
         AFTO Form 22 response procedures.
      9.9.5.2. Procedures above do not preclude Air Staff or Lead Command from requesting
      broad management analysis or review of munitions items or an item series for special
      review or analysis based on prevailing field conditions. These requests should be fully
      supported by field level data and information.

                                          Chapter 10

                    WAR RESERVE MATERIEL (WRM) MUNITIONS

10.1. General. WRM munitions are required to support wartime activities listed in the AF War
and Mobilization Plan (WMP) until the industrial base meets wartime demands. The forward
presence stressed in the defense planning guidance (DPG) demands WRM munitions to be stored
or moved quickly to critical areas. WRM munitions are pre-positioned at operating bases,
dispersed in areas of responsibility, placed aboard APF vessels, and stored at selected units and
depots for surface or air deployment.
   10.1.1. Refer to Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information for
   definitions of the WMP, Vol. 1 through Vol. 5, Logistics Feasibility Assessment Capability
   (LOGFAC) , WCDO, NCAA, TAMP, and DLAR.
   10.1.2. Refer to paragraph 3.6 for instructions and guidance on classifying information
   used, controlled, or produced from manual or automated munitions systems.
10.2. Positioning Objectives. The MAJCOM/NAF will provide units with WRM munitions
positioning objectives using the WCDO for wartime requirements. In addition, the most recent
NCAA CTR pre-positioning objective for each theater will be used. For OCONUS Component
MAJCOMs (USAFE, PACAF, and AFCENT) this is the CTR Starter Stock. For other
MAJCOMs this is the CTR for all theaters supported.
10.3. War Consumables Distribution Objective (WCDO).
   10.3.1. The WCDO is developed in LOGFAC where the Air Force WMP-4 resides. The
   NCAA interfaces with LOGFAC. LOGFAC distributes the NCAA theater requirement to
   operating bases and results are published on the unit WCDO. In addition to the information
   below, refer to the WCDO process outlined in AFI 25-101.
   10.3.2. For all WRM commodities, including munitions, the WCDO serves as the theater
   positioning objectives for each DoDAAC.
   10.3.3. The WCDO provides authorizations for starter stock munitions to support OPLAN
   execution.
   10.3.4. Operations, munitions, plans, and intelligence functions cooperate to produce the
   theater WCDO.
       10.3.4.1. The NCAA establishes munitions requirements. AF/A5R-C provides NCAA
       theater requirement interface file to the LOGFAC SPO for inclusion into LOGFAC. The
       MAJCOM/NAF logistic planners in coordination with Operations distribute the NCAA
       CTR to build the theater WCDO.
       10.3.4.2. MAJCOM/NAF logistics planners produce and coordinate the WCDO prior to
       distribution to unit WRM managers and the MASO. The theater WCDO will match the
       NCAA CTR for the given theater.
   10.3.5. Munitions WRM distribution and realignment is performed through the GAP process
   IAW Chapter 15.
 200                                                                   AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


10.4. WRM Munitions Financial Accounting.
   10.4.1. In addition to the below information, refer to AFI 25-101 for additional guidance and
   procedures.
   10.4.2. The MAJCOM (including ARC) munitions staff (or equivalent) advises the
   MAJCOM A4 Resources Division on command/theater O&M WRM munitions budget
   requirements.
   10.4.3. The MAJCOM PEM, in coordination with its FMB, distributes WRM funds to
   authorized base level activities, monitors fund disbursement, and expenditure and
   recommends reprogramming actions.
   10.4.4. The MAJCOM PEM validates unit unfunded or unprogrammed requirements.
   10.4.5. The MAJCOM A4 munitions staff in coordination with the MAJCOM PEM and
   Lead Command advises units on submission of the PEC 28030 budget.
10.5. Planning Logistics Support.
   10.5.1. All US Air Force war or contingency plans must contain a logistics annex
   sufficiently detailed to enable personnel to support the planned operation immediately and
   efficiently. MAJCOMs and NAFs develop the munitions appendix to this annex.
   10.5.2. Component services manage logistics support. Each service determines its
   requirements and budgets for necessary commodities. When produced, munitions and
   missiles become stock, owned by the individual service component.
   10.5.3. Unified commands are not responsible for logistics support of assigned forces.
   However, on execution of a unified OPLAN, the unified commander assumes directive
   authority over all components in the operating theater.
   10.5.4. The NAF will coordinate with the GACP and CAF/MAF Lead Commands (ACC and
   AMC) to plan logistics support requirements.
   10.5.5. MAJCOMs and CMAs (e.g., GACP) provide logistics support at and below wing or
   base level for assigned units.
   10.5.6. Tenants coordinate support requirements with hosts before publishing any plan that
   commits host resources.
   10.5.7. When units on the installation are tenant; operating, dispersing, or staging from; or
   otherwise utilizing installation facilities and resources assigned to other commands, the
   commander with jurisdiction over the installation provides logistics support according to an
   approved MOA or MOU. Munitions units should consider the following when reviewing
   MOA or MOU:
       10.5.7.1. Formal Joint Basing integration of munitions, safety, and security processes to
       include approved variances. EXAMPLE: Local management, CSA, Explosives Safety,
       Emergency Response, Movement Control, etc.
       10.5.7.2. Management of munitions assets required by sister services and not stock listed
       in CAS.
       10.5.7.3. Sharing and use of real property, real estate, facilities, and equipment.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                    201


   10.5.8. OCONUS Supported/MAJCOMs (i.e., USAFE, PACAF, and AFCENT) in
   coordination with the appropriate NAF develop plans to receive and support augmenting
   forces. They provide all requirements for planned en route and beddown locations to
   facilitate reception and support planning.
   10.5.9. NAFs help unified commands assess reserve stocks of involved allies to identify
   potential US Air Force support requirements.
   10.5.10. MAJCOMs and NAFs assist AFRC and ANG gained units to compute
   requirements, store and preposition materiel, and prepare for activation and deployment, as
   appropriate.
   10.5.11. ACC, AMC, and AFSOC advise OCONUS MAJCOMs of additional logistics
   support required for operations in the overseas area to ensure enough storage and
   maintenance capability. The GACP and NAFs coordinate with storing commands before
   acting to preposition any materiel or changing pre-positioning in WMP-4 which would
   increase the consumable storage requirements.
   10.5.12. The SMCA operates IAW DoDD 5160.65, Single Manager for Conventional
   Ammunition (SMCA) and DoDI 5160.68, Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition
   (SMCA): Responsibilities of the SMCA, the Military Services, and United States Special
   Operations Command (USSOCOM) and plays a major role in the munitions re-supply of AF
   units. A significant amount of AF munitions are stored in CONUS Army depots. The GACP
   maintains oversight and surveillance of Air Force munitions stored in CONUS depot stock.
10.6. Logistics Planning for Munitions Movement.
   10.6.1. When unable to store WRM munitions at or near the employment base, the
   MAJCOM/NAF in coordination with GACP may position munitions in central storage areas,
   theater storage facilities, or at other operational bases. In these cases, the MAJCOM/NAF
   develops detailed plans and establishes MOU as necessary to facilitate movement of stocks
   when they are needed at wartime operating locations.
   10.6.2. OPLANs may direct combat aircraft to deploy with munitions aboard. EXAMPLE:
   Air-to-air missiles, 20mm/30mm, or chaff and flare. NAFs identify and reflect these type
   movement requirements in MAJCOM or theater OPLANs and logistics movement plans.
   Execution of the OPLAN activates this phase of munitions relocation.
   10.6.3. The MAJCOM/NAF TACP/RACP and GACP optimize pre-positioning at planned
   operating bases given sortie production requirements, threat and storage and transportation
   capabilities.
   10.6.4. The MAJCOM/NAF TACP/RACP and GACP track munitions requirements and
   distribution. They initiate munitions movements not already covered by tactical movement.
   The MAJCOM/NAF TACP/RACP serve as consolidated command points of contact with
   inter-theater and intra-theater support organizations.
10.7. MAJCOM Command Overflow.
   10.7.1. The NAFs and CAF, MAF, and SOF Lead Commands (ACC, AMC, and AFSOC)
   must identify to GACP how much of each unit's WRM munitions requirement come from
   CONUS stocks or production.
 202                                                                AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


   10.7.2. Once NAFs and Lead Commands determine these shortfalls, they submit them to
   GACP for sourcing.
   10.7.3. The GACP will:
       10.7.3.1. Source theater shortfall requirements, assures TPFDD transportation support,
       and publishes an approved AF support plan for each MAJCOM/theater OPLAN.
       Redistribution or realignment of AFRC or ANG assets will be coordinated with AFRC or
       NGB.
       10.7.3.2. Coordinate support plans with the affected MAJCOM s/NAFs.
       10.7.3.3. Satisfy the planned requirements of the MAJCOM/NAF as far as possible,
       including worldwide redistribution and asset realignment, and delivery of substitute
       munitions when preferred assets are not available.
       10.7.3.4. Ensure command overflow shipments reflect the following:
          10.7.3.4.1. Receiving DoDAAC.
          10.7.3.4.2. Shipping DoDAAC (when possible).
          10.7.3.4.3. Sequence of execution.
          10.7.3.4.4. Required Delivery Date (RDD).
          10.7.3.4.5. Port of Embarkation (POE).
          10.7.3.4.6. Port of Debarkation (POD).
          10.7.3.4.7. Type of movement (air, surface, unit move or deployment).
       10.7.3.5. Develop support plans based on approved time-phased requirements. These
       requirements come from the Wartime Aircraft Activity (WAA) file approved for the
       planned year. Include outload and receipt capacity of break bulk/CADS points, ports,
       and receiving units in support plans to ensure all the munitions that are scheduled to
       arrive within a specified time period can be off-loaded and stored for use.
   10.7.4. All executing activities maintain plans with changes as they occur. They must
   ensure current and executable information is available to the SMCA, GACP, NAFs, and
   shipping and receiving units. EXAMPLE: When a MAJCOM/NAF TACP/RACP calls
   forward an item into the operational theater, the executing activity accordingly reduces the
   command overflow.
10.8. Munitions Call-forward.
   10.8.1. GACP: Coordinates requisitions with the U.S. Army Joint Munitions Command
   (JMC) to meet MAJCOM RDDs.
   10.8.2. JMC in-turn will submit the requisition to SMCA, SDDC and Military Sealift
   Command (MSC) as required for movement to meet RDD.
10.9. Standard Air Munitions Package (STAMP).
   10.9.1. STAMP enables pre-selected or notional tasked tactical air units to deploy rapidly
   and operate from locations without prepositioned munitions or until sustained re-supply lines
   can be established. STAMP assets may also be tasked for surface movement (truck, rail, or
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                       203


   vessel) to meet planned sustaining requirements when logistics lead-times allow such
   activity. Sortie rates, aircraft configurations, and logistics planning lead-time dictate the
   period of support from STAMP. See paragraph 11.2 for sourcing procedures.
   10.9.2. In addition to STAMP, theaters may request and establish TARRP programs within
   the operational theater to realign theater stocks in the early stages of a contingency. TARRPs
   are designed and set-up primarily as air-cargo movement assets, however, may move by
   surface modes when logistics lead-times allow.
   10.9.3. The AF has configured APF vessels to provide component commanders greater
   deployment flexibility by reducing early swing-stock requirements supported by airlift. APF
   allows strategic swing-stock munitions to move rapidly from one region to another as
   priorities or circumstances dictate. See paragraph 11.2 for sourcing procedures.
10.10. War Reserve Stocks for Allies (WRSA).
   10.10.1. WRSA comprises US military service-owned stocks intended for use in
   emergencies only to make up for shortfalls in allied ATOs. Higher headquarters must
   approve release of WRSA to allies during peacetime.
   10.10.2. Agencies controlling WRSA and MOU stocks use these guidelines when
   developing joint operating instructions with allied nations.
   10.10.3. Manage WRSA assets on a separate DoDAAC, because item prices are constrained
   to the item's original acquisition cost or the approved negotiated WRSA price.
      10.10.3.1. Manage the WRSA inventory as other Air Force WRM munitions.
      10.10.3.2. Apply the same security measures to WRSA authorizations, levels, quantities
      and other parameters as you would to WRM.
      10.10.3.3. Keep WRSA at authorized and approved levels.
      10.10.3.4. Identify shortfalls to the NAF, MAJCOM, and GACP for resolution.
      10.10.3.5. WRSA stock will be segregated from the AF stockpile whenever storage
      space is available. If munitions must be commingled, WRSA stock will be appropriately
      identified.
      10.10.3.6. Never use WRSA assets to satisfy other requirements (e.g., RDO, training)
      without NAF and GACP approval. Report to the owning MAJCOM/NAF any action
      initiated at the local level that changes the identity or serviceability of WRSA assets.
      10.10.3.7. When the GACP directs the MAJCOM/NAF TACP/RACP to release WRSA
      stocks, the TACP/RACP may transfer assets either in-mass to the allied user or
      selectively based on allied ATO shortfalls. Restrictions on release of WRSA items are as
      follows:
          10.10.3.7.1. Do not release munitions excluded by MAJCOM/NAF TACP/RACP or
          GACP (e.g., AIMs) without AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-C approval.
          10.10.3.7.2. Do not exceed dollar value (congressional authority) assigned to the
          WRSA.
204                                                               AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


         10.10.3.7.3. Stop releasing WRSA assets when you reach the assigned dollar value.
         Obtain release authority and process additional requirements through FMS IAW
         paragraph 9.6.
      10.10.3.8. When WRSA release notification is received from the appropriate authority,
      assets can be either transferred in-mass or selectively based on allied ATO shortfalls.
      10.10.3.9. Apply the MOA or other authorizing document between the US Government
      and the allied country when selling assets designated as WRSA in a military emergency.
      10.10.3.10. Proper authority may direct munitions accounts to release munitions other
      than WRSA under a follow-on MOU to support allied shortfalls.
      10.10.3.11. Release or Transfer Procedures. On receiving a RDO for WRSA or MOU
      release, affected bases prepare two sets of DD Form 1348-1A IAW AFI 23-101, AFH 23-
      123 V1, Materiel Management Reference Information, and AFH 23-123 V2, Part 2,
      Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S), Standard Base Supply System Operations for
      all FMS transactions. Bases complete both sets reflecting data required in columns 1
      through 80, item nomenclature (in block X), and weight and cube. Include the dollar
      amount of individual items and total costs. Distribute documents as follows:
         10.10.3.11.1. Set One:
             10.10.3.11.1.1. Copies numbers 1 and 6:      Retained by the distribution point

AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                      205


                                            Chapter 11

                        MUNITIONS CONTINGENCY SOURCING

11.1. Purpose. This chapter outlines contingency munitions sourcing for Air Force activities
and establishes a standard munitions report. The Munitions reporting process will provide the
CJCS, CCDRs, and Air Force activities the ability to monitor critical munitions items, affecting
warfighting capabilities during contingencies, emergencies, or exercises. In addition, the
reported information will be used in support of JMPAB deliberations. AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-
C represent the AF on the Munitions JMPAB.
11.2. Contingency Munitions Sourcing Process. The munitions allocation process described
in paragraph 14.3 is a peacetime pre-positioning process. Once contingency sourcing begins,
all munitions balances are available to support contingency operations.
   11.2.1. The MAJCOM/NAF TACP/RACP maintain authority and control for directing intra
   theater or intra command munitions movements to support operations. The MAJCOM/NAF
   directs units for these movements through official SIPRNET, email, or secure fax.
   11.2.2. CAS RDOs will be initiated by the GACP upon specific direction from the
   MAJCOM/NAF requiring the move.
   11.2.3. When operational contingency requirements exceed theater availability or cannot be
   satisfied with munitions in the operational theater, the MAJCOM/NAF requests contingency
   sourcing to the GACP. The following process outlines contingency munitions requests:
       11.2.3.1. To facilitate rapid contingency support, before operations commence, submit
       copies of supported OPLANs/CONPLANs that source STAMP or APF to the GACP with
       informational copies to AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-C.
       11.2.3.2. The MAJCOM/NAF TACP/RACP identifies and request sourcing of munitions
       to meet operational contingency requirements to the GACP via official SIPRNET, email
       or secure fax. Provide the following information:
           11.2.3.2.1. Type of munitions/munitions components required by NSN.
           11.2.3.2.2. Quantity required.
           11.2.3.2.3. Ship to Location/DoDAAC.
           11.2.3.2.4. Required in-place date.
NOTE: Requests for ASM (AIM-9, AIM-120, AGM-88, or ADM-160B) are submitted to the
GACP (Robins AFB) who will coordinate sourcing IAW the TAMP.
       11.2.3.3. The GACP will coordinate all sourcing requests for STAMP and constrained
       munitions assets in short supply to meet operational contingency requirements to
       AF/A5R-C for approval and AF/A4LW for concurrence.
       11.2.3.4. The GACP will provide availability and sourcing options to AF/A5R-C and
       AF/A4LW for decision-making.
       11.2.3.5. AF/A5R-C and AF/A4LW will provide approve/disapproval and concurrence
       as appropriate.
206                                                                 AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014

     MUNITIONS INFORMATION SYSTEMS (MIS) PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

13.1. MIS Requirement Process.
   13.1.1. The MIS requirements process involves all centrally managed information systems
   used by the munitions communities to include: CAS, TMRS, IMDS/G081, and AIT.
   13.1.2. AF/A4LW will advocate for validated MIS requirements. Successful advocacy of
   MIS requirements requires adequate preparation, presentation, planning and programming
   actions before presentation of initiatives to the A4 Requirements Board (A4RB) for
   prioritization, approval, and funding.
   13.1.3. The MIS requirements process provides a means to:
       13.1.3.1. Enable AF/A4LW and Lead Commands to bring IT requirements and
       maintenance/sustainment actions forward as potential solutions for AF prioritization,
       approval, and funding. Lead Commands request input on IT requirements and
       maintenance/sustainment actions and potential solutions from Supported Commands
       prior to presenting new requirements or maintenance/sustainment actions to AF/A4LW.
       Annually, the CAS PMO will confer with the CAF Lead Command and AFMC/A4MW
       to develop agreement and priorities for submission of future CAS requirements and
       maintenance/sustainment actions before submission to AF/A4LW.
NOTE: In this paragraph, the term "requirements" describe new changes/enhancement to the
CAS application/database. The term "maintenance/sustainment" describes CAS actions to
repair DR as well as daily data management efforts.
       13.1.3.2. Improve cross-flow of information on IT solutions currently in use, test, or
       development.
       13.1.3.3. Share information and standardize capabilities and solutions to reduce
       duplication of effort and waste of resources resulting from developing IT solutions that
       already exist or are in development elsewhere. The EAF concept requires standard
       solutions that are interoperable between organizations, MAJCOMs, and the Air Force.
       13.1.3.4. Develop fielding plans for IT solutions recommended for AF wide
       implementation (to include training and funding requirements).
       13.1.3.5. Establishment of work priorities for CAS PMO and approves software
       configuration changes to CAS.
   13.1.4. All IT requirements must be staffed, coordinated, approved, and funded by the
   AF/A4I, Directorate of Transformation.
       13.1.4.1. AF/A4LW is the munitions conduit to AF/A4I. Munitions IT requirements will
       be coordinated and staffed through the Lead Command to AF/A4LW. AF/A4LW will
       present all initiatives to AF/A4I.
       13.1.4.2. Any MIS or IT solution presented for Air Force approval must be sponsored by
       a Lead Command or AF/A4LW to be put forward to AF/A4I.
 216                                                                  AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


       13.1.4.3. All submissions for new MIS or IT requirements, concepts, or solutions must
       demonstrate a valid need supported by metrics or test data to support the proposal.
          13.1.4.3.1. Presenters should be prepared to answer the following questions, at a
          minimum:
              13.1.4.3.1.1. Does a requirement exist for this initiative?
              13.1.4.3.1.2. Does a similar solution already exist?
              13.1.4.3.1.3. What are the estimated costs to implement the solution?
              13.1.4.3.1.4. Are developmental funding costs being requested?
              13.1.4.3.1.5. What are the benefits to the AF?
              13.1.4.3.1.6. Is the proposed/identified solution proprietary?
       13.1.4.4. The CAS PMO will develop and present results of any technical evaluations
       they perform on recommended CAS solutions to ensure they are compliant with system
       architecture, security, safety, and interoperability standards.
   13.1.5. Responsibilities.
       13.1.5.1. AF/A4LW will:
          13.1.5.1.1. Make final decisions on recommended priorities to AF/A4I for CAS
          requirements.
          13.1.5.1.2. Submit MIS requirements to the AF/A4I Portfolio Manager for
          competition, prioritization, approval, and documentation in the Expectation
          Management Agreement.
       13.1.5.2. The CAS PMO will perform cost estimation, technical evaluation, and
       implementation review for submitted CAS requirements.
13.2. CAS System Management Procedures. FSA responsibilities to support the CAS
application software residing on the GCSS-AF Integrated Framework are described below. The
Air Force authorizes access levels to empower the lowest management levels, minimize
functional and MAJCOM involvement, simplify administration tasks, and decentralize
execution, to implement enterprise standards. These procedures clarify separation of duties
required by personnel supporting the three-tier level (PMO/MAJCOM/Base) CAS application
software residing on the Air Force Portal.
   13.2.1. The CAS PMO (AFLCMC/HIAM) is responsible for the overall functional
   administration of the CAS application software residing on the GCSS-AF Integrated
   Framework. The CAS PMO will appoint FSA in writing. The appointed FSAs will grant
   CAS Admin and Users privileges to authorized CAS users via the GCSS-AF Integrated
   Framework. The FSA appointments will be validated annually. The CAS PMO will submit
   a memorandum to HQ GCSS-AF requesting the listed personnel be granted the
   CAS_ADMIN role, which in turn enables the CAS PMO the ability to grant or delete
   privileges to appointed MAJCOM and base level SAs.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                       217


  13.2.2. CAS Functional Overview. CAS supports AF combat and support units, GACP (Hill
  AFB and Robins AFB), TMCP (Robins AFB), AFCOMAC, and various munitions training
  centers. The objective of CAS is to improve Air Force combat and logistics capabilities by
  providing effective munitions management and accountability at each level of combat
  execution from the unit to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
  13.2.3. Contingencies and Alternate States/Modes of Operation. By design, there is no
  “degraded or alternate mode” of CAS operation. Automated processing requires a fully
  operational connectivity to the Internet. The primary mode of operation in the absence of
  Internet connectivity or computer support is through manual post-post procedures identified
  in Attachment 2, Off-line Processing (Post-Post).
  13.2.4. Security. The data and information handled by the CAS application operates at the
  unclassified sensitive level (FOUO).
  13.2.5. Automatic Information Technology (AIT). CAS is tasked to identify and implement
  approved automatic information technologies to improve munitions data collection and
  streamline munitions maintenance processes. These processes includes but not limited to the
  user of labeling and scanning of bar-codes, use of Radio Frequency Identification and mobile
  devices to provide data collection at the points of maintenance as event occur to improve data
  reliability and timeliness.
     13.2.5.1. CAS AIT software will utilize with the Air Force Enterprise Data Collection to
     standardize data collection and reuse of data across the Logistic community.
     Applications on mobile device will be tailored to improve processes while providing
     CAS the necessary information to create accountable the auditable transactions based on
     USERID and user permissions.
     13.2.5.2. AIT software will provide a CAS generated response for each transaction
     process providing either a “Success” message or movement “Error”. Edit these
     transactions to correct any error for storage conditions (i.e., NEW, CIIC, compatibility).
     User will be notified if other conditions exist that prevent the transaction from processing
     correctly in CAS and these transaction will be captured in CAS AIT Conflict Resolution
     (AMP09A) program to allow user the correct the errors by editing the transaction or
     deleting the transaction.
  13.2.6. System Performance. Although numerous techniques exist for system performance
  measurement, throughput is of considerable importance to a user. The CAS processing
  environment permits application processing in an on-line, interactive mode with scheduled
  batch processes executing in background mode. Actual throughput is dependent upon the
  execution mode mix. EXAMPLE: The volume, execution request types, and number of
  users signed on at any point in time. Large file downloads should be run during end-of-day
  processing. Users need to be mindful that end-of-day processing in one time zone may
  impact users in different time zones.

  MUNITIONS REQUIREMENTS, ALLOCATIONS AND BUY-BUDGET PROCESS

14.1. Conventional Munitions Requirements. Munitions requirements are determined using
the guidance prescribed in DoDI 3000.04. The annual process to determine requirements is led
by AF/A5R-C. The process depicted in Figure 14.1, Air Force Conventional Munitions
Requirements Process produces a five-year munitions forecast that is the primary vehicle to
request and allocate air-to-ground and ground munitions required for test, training, and
operational needs. The most current allocation CAT and Requirements Codes can be located on
the GACP website (News & Info page) when developing forecasts and submitting OOCR.
   14.1.1. Munitions Working Group (MWG). The purpose of the MWG is to educate the
   munitions requirements stakeholders on the process, update stakeholders on current
   munitions status, ensure accurate munitions and weapons effects data are utilized in analysis,
   and understand relevant changes to theater operations plans. Topics will include:
       14.1.1.1. Briefings on munitions in production/development, focused on employment
       issues and the operational impact of logistics supportability.
       14.1.1.2. WSEP reviews.
       14.1.1.3. Theater employment and HAF activities, process improvements, lessons
       learned, and action items pertaining to GAP, requirements, and stockpile allocations. The
       GACP provides an overview of the previous year’s GAP and major changes to
       forecasting procedures.
   14.1.2. Theater Working Group (TWG) meetings. The TWG meetings are an extension
   of the MWG during which AF/A5R-C NCAA branch visits NAFs as dictated by National
   Defense Strategy, Guidance for the Development of the Force (GDF), and MRP
   Implementation Guidance to refine munitions employment and utilization. The respective
   theater hosts the TWG meeting ensuring appropriate participation of theater warfighters.
   Representatives from operations, intelligence, plans and logistics shall attend these meetings
   to provide theater inputs and assumptions for the NCAA development process. These inputs
   and assumptions are then used to define each theater’s WRM and training requirements and
   Expenditure Per Sortie Factor (EPSF) rates.
   14.1.3. TAMP. The annual TAMP is an AF/A5R-C sponsored, WR-ALC hosted event.
       14.1.3.1. The purpose of the TAMP is to serve as a discussion forum and to make
       positioning decisions for existing ASMs (e.g., AIM-9, AIM-120 and AGM-88).
       14.1.3.2. Agenda topics include: Briefings on air superiority munitions program and
       beddown updates, projected inventory status, test and evaluation requirements, WSEP
       status, CATM requirements, and allocation and requirements methodology.
14.2. Munitions Requirements Forecast Process. The munitions forecast is an annual process
to identify munitions requirements in Categories A, B, C, D, E, F, N, and T. The annual PCAR
memorandum provides specific procedures and CAT Code definitions. The overall process is
described in the following paragraphs:
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                    219


   14.2.1. Munitions requirements are derived from AFI 11-212; AFCATs 21-209, Volume 1
   and Volume 2, and their associated GMAT tables on the GACP website; the Air Force
   Standard for Non-Expendable Air Munitions Training Authorizations, the UCML, test plans,
   expenditure history, bed-down plans, and the PCAR memorandum. Munitions requirements
   categories are defined in the PCAR memorandum.

Figure 14.1. Air Force Conventional Munitions Requirements Process.




   14.2.2. The GACP initiates the process in coordination with AF/A5R-C and AF/A4LW by
   providing the annual requirements forecast instructions to MAJCOM munitions staffs not
   later than 15 October. The forecast instruction memorandum notification will be e-mailed to
   MAJCOM/NAF MUFMs and munitions staffs and content posted to the GACP website.
   14.2.3. MAJCOM/NAF A4 munitions staffs will distribute requirements forecast
   instructions to the MAJCOM/NAF MUFMs and the MASOs. MUFMs will consolidate and
   validate munitions requirements and develop the consolidated forecast according to
   paragraph 9.7.
   14.2.4. Forecasting and Managing CAT Code B (non-NCAA WRM) Allocations. CAT
   Code B, Miscellaneous munitions authorizations are forecasted and allocated against
   requirement code BP using AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1 and the GMAT for Ground Munitions
   on the GACP website. Approved allocations are distributed programmatically by Using
 220                                                               AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014

NOTES:
1. AMST will automatically allocate the percentages described in this table. No
MAJCOM/unit action is required.
2. Assets will be allocated/prepositioned within the command.
3. Allocations will be placed at the MAJCOM hold accounts until deployment tasking.
4. 15-percent of assets will be allocated/prepositioned within each of the commands.
5. Assets will be allocated/prepositioned in STAMP.

           14.2.4.2.2. 45-percent of the total CONUS allocated quantity will be distributed
           by the Using Command among the OCONUS commands (15-percent each) as an
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                      221


         OCONUS theater pre- positioning objective. CONUS units, will not requisition
         these quantities.
             14.2.4.2.2.1. 15-percent of the CONUS allocated quantity will be the OCONUS
             theater pre-positioning objective for each OCONUS command (PACAF, USAFE,
             and AFCENT). OCONUS commands will identify theater pre-positioning
             locations, by DoDAAC, and ensure the designated units requisition quantities
             necessary to satisfy the allocated pre-positioning quantity.
             14.2.4.2.2.2. If OCONUS commands cannot store CONUS pre-positioned assets
             at the intended base, the OCONUS command positions assets in-theater at a
             location that can support theater logistics movement.
             14.2.4.2.2.3. OCONUS commands ensure quantities in excess of the command’s
             OCONUS allocation are applied to the CONUS pre-positioned allocation before
             requisitioning. Only requisition pre-positioning quantities when existing assets do
             not satisfy the total OCONUS and CONUS pre-positioned allocation.
         14.2.4.2.3. 25-percent of the total CONUS allocated quantity will be the STAMP
         positioning objective. CONUS units, including ARC units, will not requisition these
         quantities. STAMP will requisition and position these assets.
     14.2.4.3. The GACP will ensure CONUS base excess over the 30-percent CONUS base
     positioning objective is realigned to meet STAMP positioning objectives.
     14.2.4.4. The GACP in coordination with AFMC/A4MW develops UTC according to
     AFI 10-401 to support STAMP outload of these assets.
     14.2.4.5. CONUS and OCONUS excess and shortage conditions will be satisfied through
     the GAP and MMP processes.
     14.2.4.6. CONUS units will include the 30-percent CONUS, 45-percent OCONUS pre-
     positioned and the 25-percent STAMP positioned quantities as “available” for SORTS
     reporting.
  14.2.5. Requirements for ejector cartridges must be factored into the forecast.
  14.2.6. Requirements of air-to-ground munitions for aircrew and ground crew training are
  determined IAW AFI 11-212. ACC/A3TW, AFMC, and AFSOC submit RAP requirements
  to the GACP and AF/A5R-C annually.
  14.2.7. The NAF forecasts for OCONUS CAT Code T requirements and the Lead Command
  forecasts for CONUS CAT Code T requirements. Lead Commands coordinate with
  Supported Commands during development of CONUS CAT Code T requirements forecasts.
  14.2.8. AF/A5R-C, AFSFC/SFXW, and AFCEC/CXD co-chair and the GACP hosts the
  Munitions Requirements Working Group. Air Staff reviews and discusses forecast data with
  MAJCOM/NAF MUFMs, adjusts as necessary, before approving worldwide munitions
  requirements.
     14.2.8.1. MAJCOM/NAF MUFMs provide requirements forecast changes with
     adjustments/rationale at the conclusion of the requirements review.
 222                                                                   AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


       14.2.8.2. Any disputes regarding changes made to the forecast will be sent to AF/A5R-C,
       AFSFC/SFXW, and AFCEC/CXD. The Air Staff will resolve any open issues and
       validate final munitions requirements changes.
14.3. Munitions Allocation Process. AF/A5R-C, AF/A4LW, AFSFC/SFXW, and
AFCEC/CXD co-chair and the GACP hosts the Munitions Allocation working group. The
allocation working group is used to match limited worldwide inventory against validated
requirements (derived from the requirements working group). Munitions beddown plans are
validated against asset allocations and necessary adjustments are made. The following should be
considered: Substitute munitions and items when the primary munitions are unavailable (while
substitutes may satisfy one or more functions, it might not necessarily perform satisfactorily in
all instances); issues that impact deployments, ANG, AFRC, and training; available
infrastructure; and new or revised mission changes to include Base Realignment and Closure
announcements.
   14.3.1. The GACP will release an Air Staff coordinated agenda for the allocation working
   group. Air Staff will provide the parameters for stockpile optimization for inclusion with the
   agenda.
       14.3.1.1. Ten duty days before the allocation working group, the GACP will provide the
       MAJCOM/NAF MUFMs with information relative to inventory availability and other
       issues.
       14.3.1.2. Attendees will be limited to those activities invited by the allocation working
       group memorandum (e.g., host, chair, co-chairs, MAJCOM/NAF munitions staff).
   14.3.2. The Munitions Allocation Working Group.
       14.3.2.1. AF/A5R-C, AFSFC/SFXW, and AFCEC/CXD decide the priority order of
       build for stockpile optimization. Stockpile optimization is the process of merging the
       available inventory with the priority build list to achieve a supportability position. At the
       beginning of the allocation working group, these activities will brief the prioritization
       methodology.
       14.3.2.2. AF/A5R-C, AFSFC/SFXW, and AFCEC/CXD decide allocations.
       14.3.2.3. MAJCOM/NAF representatives will observe, advocate interests, and support
       other MAJCOMs.
   14.3.3. The GACP records the allocation decisions in the initial DLAR and provides it to
   the MAJCOM/NAF munitions staffs, AF/A5R-C, AFSFC/SFXW, and AFCEC/CXD NLT
   two weeks after the working group.
   14.3.4. MAJCOMs and NAFs will use an initial DLAR to prepare prior to the GAP working
   group convening.
   14.3.5. A final DLAR is published NLT 30 calendar days following the GAP working group
   convening. MAJCOM/NAF munitions staffs will facilitate the allocation process by
   assisting the MAJCOM/NAF MUFMs. MUFMs will finalize theater/command positioning
   decisions in AMST prior to the GAP Working Group convening.
   14.3.6. For tenant units, The MAJCOM/NAF MUFM sends using NAF theater allocations to
   the host MAJCOM/NAF theater providing munitions support. Host MAJCOM/NAF theaters
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                     223


   cannot change allocations for tenant units. MAJCOMs/NAFs must notify the GACP of any
   host/user allocation transfers.
14.4. Allocation Increase or Addition Requests” Request for allocation increases or
additions will be prepared and coordinated IAW paragraphs 7. 4.2 and 7.4.3.
14.5. Buy-Budget Process. The munitions Buy-Budget Review (BBR) addresses procurement
of conventional ground, air-to-ground, EOD munitions, small arms, and associated equipment
(excluding missiles). The procurement of SOF unique MFP-11 conventional ground, air-to-
ground, small arms and associated equipment is conducted by USSOCOM. Procurement of
these items is part of the overall DoD Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE)
system.
   14.5.1. The GACP hosts and AF/A5R-C, AF/A5XS, and AF/AQXR co-chair the BBR in
   April to facilitate preparation of Budget Estimate Submission (BES) / Program Budget
   Review (PBR) justification documentation for Procurement of Ammunition, Air Force
   (Appropriation 3011), Munitions and Related Equipment (Budget Program 3500).
       14.5.1.1. Prior to the BBR, the GACP and other affected AFMC product centers will
       prepare a Buy Book of budget exhibits and provide an advance copy to assist BBR co-
       chairs and AFCEC/CXD in determining munitions and associated equipment funding
       priorities.
       14.5.1.2. During the BBR:
          14.5.1.2.1. The GACP will present procurement recommendations based on
          forecasted requirements, inventory analysis, prior procurement action and industrial
          production capabilities.
          14.5.1.2.2. AF/AQXR will analyze procurement data and recommend the best use of

                                          Chapter 15

                          GLOBAL ASSET POSITIONING (GAP)

15.1. Program Scope. GAP integrates five munitions WRM positioning programs to meet
anticipated demands on time and resources. These provide theater commanders with their initial
starter stocks, provide rapid swing stock response capability with the APF and STAMP and
provides for operational swing-stock positioning by theaters and CONUS.
15.2. The Global Asset Positioning (GAP) Working Group. AF/A4LW sponsors and the
GACP hosts activity of the GAP working group and establishes positioning goals and objectives
for the Air Force, resolves issues of mutual concern and develops a munitions positioning
strategy for near- and mid-term munitions components for WRM, test, and training.
   15.2.1. SPO participation is critical to acquisition support of GAP decisions. Production
   quantities and delivery dates must be published to AF/A5R-C, Lead Command, GACP and
   TMCP as necessary.
   15.2.2. This process identifies the following FY mandatory munitions movements. The
   annual MMP is produced as a result of decisions made by the GAP working group.
   Additionally, the working group validates beddown plans against movements and makes
   adjustments as necessary. The following are considered: APF, STAMP, Operational in-
   place theater stocks, CONUS stocks, test and training, delivery schedules of additional assets
   (legacy and new).
   15.2.3. Any deviation from the MMP requires a coordinated NAF/A4 and MAJCOM/A5
   request submitted through their unified command J-3 and J-4 to the Joint Staff J-3/J-4. Joint
   Staff J-3/J-4 will staff the deviation with AF/A4 and AF/A5 for approval. Joint Staff J-3/J-4
   will return the coordinated approval/response to the applicable MAJCOM/NAF.
   15.2.4. The GACP will consolidate, publish and track action items and lessons learned from
   each cycle. They will in turn provide status and related information to participants
   throughout the year and prior to the start of each working group.
15.3. Afloat Prepositioned Fleet (APF) Management.
   15.3.1. General. The AF APF prepositions forward-based munitions cargo in support of
   CCDRs.
       15.3.1.1. The APF provides significantly greater deployment flexibility by reducing
       early lift requirements and allows for rapid movement “swing-stock” of critical munitions
       assets from one region to another based on National Command Authority (NCA)
       priorities.
       15.3.1.2. The APF is manned and maintained by civilian mariner crews contracted
       through the Military Sealift Command (MSC). Vessels require permissive off-loading
       with adequate terminal and port facilities, either afloat or ashore, to discharge explosive
       cargo. Supported MAJCOMs and NAFs must ensure host nation support to expedite
       cargo operations, minimize port congestion, and move the forward echelon out of the
       seaports.
226                                                                AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


      15.3.1.3. During APF configuration and load-out operations, except for Current
      Operations, APF has highest priority for munitions sourcing due to the limited window of
      availability.
  15.3.2. APF Contingency Discharge Operations.
      15.3.2.1. If an APF vessel is tasked for contingency discharge and apportioned to a
      theater, the APF Management Team will transfer accountability functions for APF cargo
      to the appropriate MAJCOM/NAF DoDAAC. The MAJCOM/NAF munitions staff will
      process shipments in CAS to the ultimate consignee DoDAAC for each APF container
      planned for discharge.
      15.3.2.2. Prior to commencing discharge operations, the theater NAF must provide the
      APF Management Team with a theater distribution plan identifying the ultimate
      consignee DoDAAC for each APF munitions container to be discharged.
      15.3.2.3. The APF Management Team will deploy a Port Management Team(s) to the
      planned Sea Port of Debarkation (SPOD) to manage munitions offload sequence and
      priorities.
      15.3.2.4. After theater APF discharge and distribution operations are complete, the APF
      Management Team and the NAF munitions staff will reconcile assets remaining on the
      NAF DoDAAC by matching those remaining on the APF vessel. Once reconciled, the
      APF Management Team in coordination with the NAF will transfer APF assets back to
      the APF vessel DoDAAC.
  15.3.3. APF Peacetime Discharge Operations.
      15.3.3.1. APF vessels may be planned for peacetime discharge to reposition specific
      munitions assets ashore in one or more theaters. During peacetime APF assets are not
      apportioned to the effected theater and the APF management team ships specific assets to
      the ultimate consignee DoDAAC.
      15.3.3.2. Peacetime discharge of selected APF assets is done only after coordination with
      AF/A4LW, AF/A5R-C, and the effected theater logistics/munitions planners.
      15.3.3.3. The APF management team may be tasked to deploy a Port Management
      Team(s) to coordinate munitions discharge and reconcile assets remaining on the APF
      vessel.
  15.3.4. APF Apportionment.
      15.3.4.1. During peacetime, apportioned APF assets are under the operational control of
      the Theater Commander in whose area of responsibility the ships are located.
      15.3.4.2. For contingency and crisis action planning, the JSCP apportions the APF as
      forces. As apportioned in the JSCP, one or more vessels may be tasked in OPLAN Time-
      Phased Force and Deployment Lists (TPFDL).
         15.3.4.2.1. TPFDD research must consider ship stowage plans, port unloading times,
         and the time to move assets from one theater to another. Also consider assets
         available through other means such as CONUS or forward-based swing stocks, and
         STAMP. Approximate fleet-sail-times can be obtained from the GACP APF
         Management Team or APF Battlebooks.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                  227


          15.3.4.2.2. The unified command’s air component submits TPFDD requirements to
          the theater commander. The theater commander validates the requirements during the
          execution-planning phase for later entry into the theater commander’s validated
          TPFDD. Deployment planning should allow for flexibility as the preplanned
          priorities sometime change in execution.
          15.3.4.2.3. During execution, actual commitment of the APF to theater commanders
          will be IAW Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) established priorities. Once the vessel is
          chopped to the theater commander, he or she decides how to best utilize the afloat
          assets by determining the offload strategy to meet mission needs. Theater
          commanders may address requests for reallocation of assets to the CJCS to be
          handled through the JMPAB. Final authority to divert APF vessels requires NCA
          approval. The JMPAB decides user priority if more than one OPLAN is executed
          simultaneously.
   15.3.5. APF Program Responsibilities. Operational and Maintenance activities of the AF
   APF program in support of port and theater operations will be IAW Chapter 8 and this
   chapter. In addition to the following responsibilities, see Table 15.1, APF Program
   (APL000) Funds Management Alignment for alignment of APF PPBE responsibility.

although an integral part of GAP, are managed by owning theater commanders in consideration
of applicable Air Force positioning guidance. CONUS stored assets can be in any one of three
categories:
   15.5.1. Retail stocks assigned to CONUS base accounts.
   15.5.2. Retail stocks at AFMC depots or facilities (i.e., STAMP).
   15.5.3. Wholesale stocks at Army ammunition plants and depots. The SMCA manages these
   Army depots. Most Air Force CONUS-stored assets are at these SMCA-managed locations.
15.6. Munitions Transportation Funding, PACER AMMO. PACER AMMO is the official
DoD nickname for the centralized funding process identifying the transportation requirements to
meet MAJCOM munitions positioning objectives.
   15.6.1. AFMC/A4MW coordinates with the MAJCOM (CONUS) and NAF (OCONUS)
   munitions staffs and is responsible for monitoring and tracking the transportation funding
   process for all AF munitions movements. This includes CONUS Port Handling and Inland
   Transportation (PHIT), and OCONUS sea and air costs. OCONUS PHIT surface (truck/rail)
   movements are not paid by PACER AMMO project codes.
   15.6.2. The NCAA provides munitions requirements while the TAMP and DLAR provide
   allocations and positioning objectives.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                     235


     15.6.2.1. MAJCOMs (CONUS) and NAFs (OCONUS) determine which munitions to
     request for call forward and retrograde based on their allocations and theater operational
     plans.
     15.6.2.2. Positioning objectives are determined by the TAMP and GAP working groups
     based on MAJCOM (CONUS) and NAF (OCONUS) desires and Air Force objectives as
     determined by Air Staff.
  15.6.3. Transportation funding requirements must be identified and resources allocated to
  support munitions movements from point of origin to final destination within the CONUS
  and to the OCONUS port of entry.
     15.6.3.1. The MMP developed during the GAP working group will provide the basis for
     forecasting and allocating SDT funding for munitions movements. At a minimum, the
     MMP will include:
         15.6.3.1.1. Forecasted short tons, by command or organization (to include scheduled
         APF reconstitution) for each project code.
         15.6.3.1.2. Project codes 729-736 movements as the average of the previous 3 years
         MMP submissions.
         15.6.3.1.3. All ANG forecasted movements under project code 737.
  15.6.4. The MAJCOMs, NAFs, AFRC, NGB and GACP must be active participants in the
  PACER AMMO process. GACP with AF/A5R-C and/or AF/A4LW concurrence will make
  final movement determinations. Moves that are not identified at the GAP and included in the
  MMP require AF/A5R-C approval.
     15.6.4.1. PACER AMMO will provide the focus to justify and advocate funding to
     preposition the worldwide munitions stockpile IAW the GAP/TAMP and MMP.
     15.6.4.2. The MMP will be costed out by AFMC/A4MW and used as the basis for the
     SDT requirement submission for munitions moves within the Air Force. When SDT
     funds are released, the MAJCOMs will be notified of approved MMP moves.

Terms
Abbreviated WSN—A truncated WSN consisting of the CRWC and the last three digits of S/N
(excludes DoDAAC). EXAMPLE: BL2CM-001.
Air Tasking Order (ATO)—A method used to task and disseminate to components,
subordinate units and command and control agencies projected sorties, capabilities and forces to
targets and specific missions. Normally provides specific instructions to include call signs,
targets, controlling agencies, etc., as well as general instructions.
Centralized Management Agency (CMA)—Organizations with a specialized clear goal and
scope associated with an Air Force-wide mission capability that provides functional support
reachback to Lead Commands, supported MAJCOMs, component NAFs, FOAs and DRU and
units and Activities that comprise a workload that are centrally located and performed by an
organization to eliminate redundant capabilities across the Air Force.
Chemical Warfare Material (CWM)—Items generally configured as a munitions containing a
chemical compound that is intended to kill, seriously injure, or incapacitate a person through its
physiological effects. CWM includes V and G-series nerve agents or H-series (mustard) and L-
series (lewisite) blister agents in other-than-munitions configurations; and certain industrial
chemicals (e.g., Hydrogen Cyanide (AC), Cyanogen Chloride (CK), or Carbonyl Dichloride
(called phosgene or CG)) configured as a military munition. Due to their hazards, prevalence,
and military-unique application, chemical agent identification set (CAIS) are also considered
CWM. CWM does not include: riot control devices; chemical defoliants and herbicides;
industrial chemicals (e.g., AC, CK, or CG) not configured as a munition; smoke and other
obscuration producing items; flame and incendiary producing items; or soil, water, debris or
other media contaminated with low concentrations of chemical agents where no CA hazards
exist.
Collocated Operating Base (COB)—An active or reserve allied airfield designated for joint or
unilateral use by US Air Force wartime augmentation forces or for wartime relocation of US Air
Force in theater forces. COBs are not US bases.
Combat Ammunition System (CAS)—Air Force’s single system of record for the management
of conventional munitions. Provide a global view of assets under the physical control of the Air
Force.
Complete Round Dictionary (CRD)—A listing of complete round weapon codes and the
associated components (by qty) necessary to assemble a given weapon.
Complete Round Weapon Code (CRWC)—5 Digit code utilized to generically identify
complete rounds. EXAMPLE: BL2CM.
Component MAJCOM (C MAJCOM)—MAJCOMs that serve a component role. Air Force
Component Commander and staff that support the CCDR at the strategic level. The staff does
not duplicate the functions of the AFFOR Staff.
Component Numbered Air Force (C-NAF)—NAF that serve a component role, either
subordinate to component or component NAF. The staff supports the Air Force Component
Commander at the operational and tactical level and is manned with a minimum core capability
to handle steady state operations and contingency scenarios.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                          257


Concept of Operations (CONOPS)—A verbal or graphic statement, in broad outline, of a
commander's assumptions or intent in regard to an operation or series of operations. The concept
of operations frequently is embodied in campaign plans and OPLANs; in the latter case,
particularly when the plan covers a series of connected operations to be carried out
simultaneously or in succession. The concept is designed to give an overall picture of the
operation. It is included primarily for additional clarity of purpose. Frequently, it is referred to
as the commander's concept.
ContainerID—An identification name assigned to a container managed in the Combat
Ammunition System’s container management system.
Contractor Possessed Munitions (CPM) module—Application developed to provide a short
term solution to mitigate loss of reporting and visibility when AF owned munitions are shipped
to contractors for repair, modification, maintenance, or loan. Permanent solutions and
capabilities to achieve and accountable and auditable transaction history of contractor possessed
munitions are being developed.
Conventional Munition— This term is defined within AFPD 21-2, Munitions. Throughout this
AFI, the term "munition" refers to this definition. A device charged with conventional
explosives, propellants, pyrotechnics, initiating composition or biological or chemical materiel
for use in connection with defense or offense, including demolition. Certain conventional
munitions can be used for training, ceremonial, or non-operational purposes. Conventional
munitions include all explosive and non-explosive components essential for the assembly of a
complete operational round of munitions or AUR tactical missile. Additionally, items which in
themselves are considered complete operational rounds, plus any other items designated for
munitions management or reporting. In general, conventional munitions include toxic, nontoxic,
biological, incendiary explosives, smoke agents, bombs, chemical spray tanks, warheads,
rockets, explosive components of catapult and canopy remover devices, explosive demolition
materials, grenades, mines, pyrotechnics, and all types of devices used in igniting and exploding

                                      ATTACHMENT 5
 MUNITIONS FUNCTIONAL AREA TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES
  (TTP) FOR OPERATIONS IN A CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL,
       NUCLEAR, HIGH-YIELD EXPLOSIVES (CBRNE) ENVIRONMENT

A5.1. Overview.
   A5.1.1. This attachment provides a Munitions Functional Area TTP IAW AFMAN 10-2503,
   to enhance ATSO for Munitions operations and activities in CBRNE environment. This TTP
   includes contamination avoidance procedures to employ throughout the munitions production
   and delivery process and integrates contamination avoidance considerations into the use of
   munitions assets and personnel, long term identification of contaminated munitions assets,
   decontamination of munitions assets, and the handling of contaminated waste. Munitions
   organizations must be able to achieve ATSO and execute effective contamination avoidance
   procedures and/or performing munitions operations in a contaminated environment.
   A5.1.2. Munitions organizations and managers are involved in the development and
   implementation of the Munitions portion of the installation Comprehensive Emergency
   Response Plan 10-2 and associated checklists for specific CBRNE response actions when
   directed by local/higher authority. Refer to AFI 21-101 for applicable references, this
   attachment, and AFMAN 10-2503 when developing the Munitions portions of the installation
   Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan 10-2 and specific checklists.
A5.2. Contamination Avoidance Measures. Munitions activities are directly linked to sortie
generation. They involve multiple resources such as weapons, trailers, tow vehicles, and
weapons load trucks. The use or non-use of contamination avoidance measures within the
munitions area has a tremendous ripple effect on other areas of the flight line, with a
corresponding influence on sortie production capabilities. For example, if bomb bodies become
contaminated, this will require additional time for personnel to either decontaminate the bombs
or transition to Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) 4 for the entire production and
delivery process. The contaminated weapons would potentially degrade the effectiveness of the
entire production operation and environment, munitions storage area, weapons load point,
aircraft shelter areas, and end of runway (EOR) stations. For this reason, it is imperative that
munitions personnel use effective contamination avoidance techniques throughout the entire
process; from pulling the munitions components out of the storage, through the production
process, and to the point the weapons aircraft loading and arming.
A5.3. GSU/Geographically Separated Location Munitions Storage Sites.
   A5.3.1. In many cases, munitions operations occur at GSU/locations outside the main
   perimeter of the base/installation. These sites generally contain critical stocks of munitions
   production components to provide an initial munitions capability to support the mission. It is
   critical that these remote sites and the personnel are working in concert with and part of the
   overall airbase active and passive defense hierarchy and processes. These units should
   accomplish the following items to ensure these sites and personnel have sufficient protection
   from the effects of chemical and biological weapons.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                      281


      A5.3.1.1. Transfer munitions materials and supporting resources to the main
      base/installation at the earliest possible time, within the constraints of safe and secure
      storage capacity and net explosive weight (NEW) restrictions.
      A5.3.1.2. Integrate the remote munitions location/site into the airbase attack warning and
      reporting system with as many redundant methods as feasible to include the installation
      siren and giant voice system, the commander’s TV channel, radio (both military and
      radio station), and telephone lines to Munitions Control and/or Unit Control Center
      (UCC).
      A5.3.1.3. Depending on the distance from the airbase, key installation and munitions
      leadership, in conjunction with Civil Engineer Readiness, must establish rules of
      engagement (ROE) for remote site personnel. The remote site should have fixed or
      expedient shelters and bunkers for personnel, munitions, and the transport trailers and
      vehicles. Overhead covers and at a minimum the capability to employ expedient
      hardening should be a key component of this IRP protective scheme for remote munitions
      sites. The provision of overhead cover is important in that the entire munitions
      production and delivery process may need to be performed in MOPP 4 configuration for
      extended periods if the munitions components are contaminated prior to delivery to the
      production or loading sites.
      A5.3.1.4. Installation security forces and munitions personnel must consider, develop,
      and execute plans for security to protect remote munitions sites and delivery routes from
      attack. Civil Engineer Readiness personnel must plan to set up CBRNE detection
      systems at a GSU/location munitions site to include the use of pre-positioned M8 paper
      and the employment of automated detectors. Civil Engineer Readiness and the
      base/installation munitions managers must plan for and ensure the remote munitions site
      in included in installation post-attack reconnaissance plans, both in terms of on-site
      procedures and through aggressive monitoring by the installation Nuclear, Biological,
      and Chemical (NBC) Defense Cell. This should also include provisions for specialized
      post-attack reconnaissance team support as necessary.
      A5.3.1.5. Chemical agent’s rapid absorption characteristics guarantee that for
      decontamination operations to be beneficial, remote site personnel must initiate
      decontamination activity shortly after the onset of contamination since there will not be
      time for off-site personnel to arrive and conduct decontamination operations. At a
      minimum, remote munitions site personnel must possess an immediate decontamination
      capability for themselves to include:
         A5.3.1.5.1. M291 and M295 decontamination kits.
         A5.3.1.5.2. Glove and boot decontamination troughs with 5 percent chlorine
         solutions.
         A5.3.1.5.3. M295 decontamination kits for operational decontamination of munitions
         and vehicles.
A5.4. Protecting Critical Resources from Contamination throughout the Munitions
Process.
282                                                                   AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


  A5.4.1. Due to the different stages and resources used in the Munitions Operational Flow
  Process (Refer to Figure 7.1) an integrated contamination avoidance techniques are required
  for the effort to be successful. Whenever possible, ensure that munitions trailers are provided
  with overhead cover. Use fixed facilities or the provision of barrier materials to protect the
  exposed munitions and equipment surfaces to include the trailer tongues and attaching
  hardware (i.e., rail extenders, trolleys, chocks, and extensions). If you must choose between
  protecting the trailer’s surface and protecting the tongue, protect the trailer surface. This will
  help to avoid transference of chemical contamination on the trailer surface to the munitions
  immediately after chemical agent deposition. It is difficult to decontaminate a trailer’s
  surface due to uneven metal grating, cracks/crevices, tie-down points and hardware.
  Conversely, the trailer tongue is relatively easy to decontaminate with an M295
  decontamination kit and it does not represent an operationally significant contamination
  transfer hazard. If using barrier materials, if possible, cover the sides of the munitions
  trailers as well, so the undercarriage is protected.
  A5.4.2. In most cases, forklifts are used to break-out components from the storage facilities
  or areas. Storage areas should provide overhead cover if possible to prevent contamination
  from spreading to other areas and negatively affecting the entire operational process.
  Contamination avoidance measures must also extend to the protection of the break-out
  forklift/equipment and ensuring that storage facility doors are immediately closed during
  attack situations. If space exists, temporarily position forklifts/ equipment into the storage
  facility/under overhead protection and turn them off during an attack.
  A5.4.3. If feasible, and when possible, set up two or more production sites and separate them
  by the greatest possible distance to assure ability to continue operations and assure proper
  QD. This provides for concurrent operations to expedite production operations and provides
  greater redundancy if a production site becomes contaminated and unusable. If possible,
  provide overhead cover for each production operation, or enclose them entirely. Chemical
  agent absorption and hazard durations on various surfaces will impact site operations. Bomb
  production site floors should remain unpainted because chemical agents are rapidly absorbed
  into bare concrete; which will reduce the contact hazard much more rapidly. If production
  site floors must be coated, use latex based paint. Avoid the use of AM-2 matting or other
  impervious floor materials as extended residual hazards will persist if liquid contamination
  occurs.
  A5.4.4. In CBRNE threat environments, only break-out munitions components from storage
  areas for production just before their assembly is required. Effective coordination and
  scheduling of break-out and production activities can minimize the amount of time munitions
  and components are exposed to potential contamination; and maximize the time they are
  under overhead protection. Depending on the time it takes to transport munitions from
  storage areas to the production sites, it may not be cost effective from a manpower point of
  view to cover trailers, however, cover trailers and the munitions components if they routinely
  spend more than 1 hour outside an enclosed storage/production area.
  A5.4.5. After munitions are assembled and loaded onto munitions trailers, they must be
  provided overhead protection/cover as quickly as possible or placed back into covered
  storage areas on trailers/dunnage. If the flight line munitions staging areas, slips, delivery
  points employ continuous overhead cover (For example: HAS/PAS, facility, large tent/tarp
  covering several trailers spots), it may not be cost effective to cover loaded trailers during
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                         283


   transport from production to flight line staging areas/delivery points. If trailers do not have
   existing flight line overhead cover, trailers should be covered before delivering them to the
   flightline. Depending on the flying schedule/Air Tasking Order (ATO) munitions may be on
   the flightline for extended periods of time before aircraft loading occurs. It is crucial to
   protect the trailers and munitions during this extended time to avoid contamination and
   seriously degrade the positive effects of previous contamination avoidance measures.
   A5.4.6. If munitions become contaminated while in the storage area, accomplish munitions
   delivery and weapons loading in MOPP 4, even if the aircraft parking area and other
   resources (fuel trucks and weapons load trucks) are uncontaminated. If dealing with
   individual contaminated munitions trailer/loads in the flight line munitions staging areas, the
   delivery crew/weapons load crew should remove the barrier material, and dispose of it as
   contaminated waste before transporting the load to the aircraft parking/loading area.
   However, if positioning the munitions without overhead cover for more than 1 hour at or in
   the immediate vicinity of the aircraft parking/loading area, the delivery crew/weapons load
   crew should replace the barrier material over the munitions trailer or munitions.
   A5.4.7. If munitions trailers had overhead cover/protection using a method other than
   covering with barrier material, the delivery crew/weapons load crew should not transport the
   loaded munitions trailer from the flight line munitions staging area until just before aircraft
   loading begins. If positioning the munitions without overhead cover for more than 1 hour at
   or in the immediate vicinity of the aircraft parking/loading area, the weapons load crew
   should ensure that the munitions trailer is protected with barrier material/other cover. Once
   removing the munitions from the trailer at the aircraft parking/loading area, provide the
   munitions trailer with overhead cover as soon as possible. This will avoid the potential for
   contamination of the empty trailer and increase personal safety for personnel who must
   recover and reconfigure/reload the trailer upon return to the munitions area and ensures the
   next munitions production and delivery cycle can be completed in an uncontaminated
   environment.
A5.5. Integrating Contamination Avoidance Considerations into the Use of Assets and
Personnel.
   A5.5.1. Munitions personnel should protect all assets using overhead cover, dispersal, and
   expedient hardening and only employ those resources that are required and necessary at any
   given time; this decreases overall exposure of munitions, equipment, and personnel. This
   concept of operations applies to both pre and post-attack scenarios. In addition to decreasing
   the likelihood of resource contamination, and the subsequent potential for cross-
   contamination, using less resources and limiting operations when possible reduces exposure
   and has a positive ripple effect for personnel protection.
   A5.5.2. Within the constraints of explosive QD and other safety factors, munitions UCC
   personnel and supervisors should aggressively plan to utilize trailers to their maximum
   possible capacity as opposed utilizing half loads. Unless mission essential activities
   absolutely require it, resist using (and exposing) multiple assets when less assets can be used.
   Avoid the temptation to employ multiple assets during the early stages of deployment or
   employment at a location that has pre-positioned equipment. In these situations, initial
   availability of assets may exceed requirements until the full TPFDD force arrival takes place.
284                                                                AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


  A5.5.3. When possible, depending on the ATO requirements, utilize larger capacity trailers
  when simultaneous munitions delivery at multiple locations is not required. This will limit
  the number of assets exposed to a potential/actual threat environment and can have a
  significant effect on sustainment operations where the intent is to only use uncontaminated
  resources.
  A5.5.4. Due to the inherent hazard in utilizing contaminated munitions and munitions
  equipment, munitions personnel must conspicuously identify all contaminated assets. Only
  use contaminated assets when uncontaminated assets of the same type are not available, and
  keep them separated from uncontaminated resources whenever possible. Contaminated
  munitions remain hazardous to unprotected personnel for extended periods. Since this can
  have a ripple effect on sortie production activities in otherwise uncontaminated areas,
  Munitions Control/UCC personnel should locate and use uncontaminated munitions to the
  maximum extent possible.
  A5.5.5. Munitions Control/UCC should exert positive control of the personnel in relation to
  completion of critical mission activities and control movement within and between
  contamination zones or sectors. The Munitions Control/UCC should maintain constant
  awareness of contamination status of each area associated with munitions operations,
  including remote sites, different functions/operations within the munitions areas, storage
  sites, flight line munitions staging areas, and the aircraft parking/loading areas. Munitions
  Control/UCC personnel should then determine the critical mission operations that must take
  place and limit movement and activity of personnel and equipment in those areas. The
  Munitions Control/UCC must provide detailed instructions and status updates to personnel
  who must transit multiple contamination zones or sectors.
  A5.5.6. If munitions areas become contaminated and the munitions production areas do not
  have overhead cover, Munitions Control/UCC personnel should assess operational
  requirements against available assembled munitions and only plan additional munitions
  production when absolutely necessary within the first few hours after an attack, when
  contamination avoidance is the most difficult to achieve. This technique will limit personnel
  exposure to contaminated environments, reduce the number of munitions that become
  contaminated during production, and eliminate/reduce the negative ripple effect that
  contaminated munitions will have on the overall sortie production process.
  A5.5.7. Supervisors and munitions work crews report their status to ensure personnel
  working at flight line munitions staging areas and in the Munitions Control/UCC are aware
  of the contamination status of the munitions being delivered between the munitions area and
  the flight line. Effective coordination and heightened personal awareness will enhance safety
  of personnel. Munitions production personnel must ensure delivery personnel and personnel
  at staging areas are aware of the contamination hazards associated with assembled munitions
  being delivered. Staging area personnel must ensure both munitions production personnel
  and weapons load crew personnel are aware of the contamination status of munitions and
  munitions equipment within the flight line staging area and weapons load crews must ensure
  staging area and production area personnel are aware of the contamination status of
  empty/loaded trailers returning from the flight line. Whenever possible, personnel should
  complete the munitions portion of the end-of-runway (EOR) process inside aircraft shelters
  or other protected areas.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                        285


A5.6. Long Term Identification of Contaminated Munitions Assets.
   A5.6.1. The long-term identification of contaminated munitions assets is difficult since some
   assets are managed as Air Force vehicles (i.e., bobtails and forklifts) and others are managed
   as organizational equipment (i.e., weapons load trucks and munitions trailers). Initially,
   every item of contaminated ordnance needs not be individually marked. For example if an
   MHU-141 trailer load of AIM-9 missiles is contaminated, initially, it is sufficient to mark the
   overall trailer as contaminated rather than marking each missile. However, once munitions
   assets and trailers are separated each must be individually and conspicuously marked to
   ensure contamination avoidance and personnel are not exposed to unknown hazards.
   A5.6.2. Each person in the Munitions Operational Flow Process has the responsibility to
   conspicuously mark contaminated munitions assets and equipment. Initially, these marking
   will be temporary in nature, so assets may need to be remarked at periodic intervals to ensure
   temporary markings are no lost or obliterated and personnel can identify contaminated
   resources and avoid exposure to hazards. However, permanent contamination markings will
   be required for these assets in the long-term. Vehicle operators must also be instructed to
   annotate the interior portion of the AF Form 1800, Operator's Inspection Guide and Trouble
   Report at the same time they apply conspicuous external contamination markings on a
   vehicle. The operator should include the date and time of contamination, the type of agent,
   and the locations of the contamination.
   A5.6.3. Munitions personnel must relay the contamination status of equipment items to the
   Munitions Control/UCC. Personnel will do this by referencing the specific equipment item’s
   registration or S/N. Munitions Control/UCC personnel will update Section V of the
   equipment’s individual AFTO Form 244, Industrial, Support Equipment Record, with the
   date and time of contamination, the type of agent, and the locations of the contamination.
   There is no centralized tracking system to provide visibility for every item of contaminated
   munitions support equipment in the Air Force, therefore munitions personnel must ensure to
   accurately transcribe information regarding past NBC contamination whenever updating or
   re-accomplishing an AFTO Form 244. As soon as practical, vehicle operators should notify
   the Munitions Control/UCC of the contamination status of their vehicle and the Munitions
   Control/UCC will forward this information to the unit Vehicle Control Officer (VCO).
A5.7. Decontamination of Munitions Assets.
   A5.7.1. Munitions units/personnel are required to develop and maintain an installation level
   Munitions Contamination Control Team (CCT) capability to provide for expedient
   decontamination of munitions and munitions equipment within the Munitions Storage Area
   and Production areas. Because of limitations in decontamination technologies, key
   installation leadership and personnel must realize that, for decontamination operations to be
   beneficial, personnel and individual vehicle and equipment operators must operationally
   decontaminate the operational parts that will continuously be touched/handled within 1-hour
   from the time of contamination. Units may organize and equip CCT to support sustained
   operations. Each Munitions CCT team (normally two personnel) must assist unit personnel
   to develop and execute contamination avoidance and operational decontamination measures,
   to resupply the unit with decontaminants, and to collect and dispose of contaminated waste
   (see paragraph A5.4).
 286                                                                  AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


   A5.7.2. There is no need for extensive decontamination of each contaminated piece of
   ordnance, vehicle, or equipment item, as long as personnel clearly identify contaminated
   assets as containing a residual chemical hazard. Responsive operator’s and work center
   personnel’s accomplishment of operational decontamination using M295 decontamination
   kits are sufficient to continue mission operations. Decontamination operations will not
   produce significant results once the agent has absorbed into the paint or other absorbent
   surfaces. Depending on the surface, this absorption takes place in periods ranging from less
   than one minute up to approximately 1 hour. Regardless of the decontamination technique
   used, it is relatively easy to remove agents from the smooth panels before they absorb into
   the surface, but the chemical agents will tend to remain at low levels in crevices, rivet heads,
   and joints.
   A5.7.3. Consider the following when developing specific munitions decontamination
   operational procedures at the unit or individual level. Chemical or biological agents in dusty
   (small solid particle) form will not penetrate or adhere to surfaces in the same manner as
   agents in liquid form. While these agents will be relatively easy to remove with liquid
   solutions (5-percent chlorine bleach, soap and water), the threat from dusty agents is
   extremely limited and vehicle operators will probably not be able to detect the presence of
   these agents. There is no single machine, kit, team, technique, or procedure presently
   capable of fulfilling all decontamination requirements. The best chance of mitigating the
   effects of NBC contamination within the munitions area rests with the ability to accurately
   evaluate the situation, decide on an overall course of action, and direct individuals to
   accomplish a variety of avoidance and contamination control tasks based on their individual
   circumstances.
   A5.7.4. The majority of munitions assets on Air Force bases/installations use paint with
   polyurethane compounds. Chemical agents readily absorb into this type of paint. Thus,
   decontamination operations will not have a significant effect unless they take place within
   minutes after the time of contamination. Time itself equates to an effective decontamination
   technique to reduce the residual contact hazard. Impermeable surfaces like arming wires and
   other unpainted metal components do not allow agent penetration, therefore, these locations
   represent the most dangerous areas on contaminated assets.
   A5.7.5. Plastic and rubber components are porous materials and agents easily soak into these
   components. While the use of M295 decontamination kit or a 5-percent chlorine solution
   will effectively reduce or eliminate the operational contact hazard, the agent will remain
   imbedded in the material and varying degrees of vapor hazard will remain. There are no
   effective, operationally feasible methods for completely decontaminating canvas storage
   covers, webbing, and other textile materials contaminated with liquid chemical agents.
   Placing barrier materials over the item or item replacement are the best mitigation
   techniques.
A5.8. Handling of Contaminated Waste.
   A5.8.1. The effective handling and disposal of contaminated waste will require a major
   effort by munitions personnel, especially in the munitions storage and production areas. The
   act of unpacking munitions components will create large amounts of waste. Periodically,
   remove this waste from the unpacking area to a temporary or permanent waste disposal area
   in order for the munitions build process to continue. Munitions personnel must use forklifts,
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                        287


  trailers, or other vehicles to transport these heavy assets. This compilation of multiple
  packaging and waste materials becomes a potential danger site for munitions personnel.
  Since there is no effective method of decontaminating many of the materials and absolutely
  no operational need to decontaminate, dispersed agents will absorb into the packaging
  materials and remain a contamination hazard until weathering effectively mitigates the
  hazards.
  A5.8.2. Contamination hazards will probably exist within and around the collection of
  contaminated waste for a longer period than the surrounding terrain and will require
  munitions personnel to be acutely aware of these residual hazards. When establishing their
  portion of the base/installation contaminated waste disposal program, munitions personnel
  should determine where their temporary waste disposal sites will be located. They must also
  determine the location of the permanent contaminated waste disposal site, the time or stock
  level for placing materials in the temporary waste disposal site, and the mechanism to
  transport the assets from the temporary to the permanent contaminated waste disposal site.
  The temporary waste disposal site should be at least 50 feet from occupied facilities or work
  positions if possible, and the permanent contaminated waste disposal site is normally a
  centralized function for the base/installation and its location is determined by the local Civil
  Engineer Readiness representative in the Survivability and Recoverability Center (SRC).
  A5.8.3. Utilize the NBC Marking Kit to cordon off or clearly identify any waste disposal
  sites contained within the munitions storage or production area and pre-position M8 paper
  around the temporary waste disposal sites. Assume contamination if the pre-positioned M8
  paper displays positive results. Ensure each work center within the munitions areas have
  contaminated waste disposal bins for small items such as contaminated M8 paper and used
  M295 decontamination kits, and develop the mechanism and procedures for delivering the
  contaminated waste from these locations to the installation’s contaminated waste disposal
  site. In addition, determine the contamination status of the vehicles that will be transporting
  munitions packing materials to the installation contaminated waste disposal site.
  A5.8.4. Additionally, to ascertaining if items have measurable amounts of contamination on
  their surface, also locate the pockets of contamination if possible. This may entail the use of
  a Chemical Agent Monitor to pinpoint agents in liquid or dusty form housed in pockets of
  dirt and grease that M8 paper does not readily identify. If transport vehicles are
  uncontaminated, place plastic or other barrier material over the bed of the transport vehicle
  and dispose of the barrier material at the same time as the contaminated waste. At the end of
  each delivery cycle, check the vehicle for evidence of cross-contamination and take
  appropriate decontamination steps (normally the M295 decontamination kit). Mark the
  vehicle and the cargo to clearly identify the hazard associated with the contaminated cargo to
  personnel along the transportation route.

       AIR FORCE MUNITIONS DOCUMENT CONTROL PROCEDURES (T-1)

A6.1. Introduction. These AFI 21-201 procedures implement Munitions Document Control
and electronic records and file management policy, assist units with management and control of
accountable munitions documents from initiation or receipt to final disposition, and to transition
to paperless environments. These procedures implement AFMAN 33-363 and maintenance of
electronic records in accordance with the Air Force ERM Solution located on the AFRIMS site.
A6.2. Document Control General Guidance.
   A6.2.1. Munitions documents and files shall be maintained electronically to include
   “MASO-certified” true copies. Electronic documents must comply with the same intent that
   paper documents require to include levels of protection and security.
   A6.2.2. Munitions personnel will not make changes to the quantity, stock, lot, or document
   number on any accountable/auditable document (including electronic). The authorized
   custodian will initial any changes to paper documents or submit a new electronic document
   prior to processing in CAS. For receipt discrepancies identified during in-check refer to
   paragraph 7.9.2 and Table A6.1, Accountable Document Validation/Quality Control (QC)
   Matrix, Receipts, Note 7.
   A6.2.3. Munitions Supervision/MASO ensures that all classified CAS generated receipt,
   issue, expenditure, turn-in request, inventory and adjustment documents produced or
   received that are associated with non-NWRM items are stamped/typed/printed electronically
   with “CLASSIFIED ITEM” in red, bold, capital letters on original and all copies. Stamp
   documentation associated with NWRM items with “NWRM CLASSIFIED ITEM” IAW AFI
   20-110. This alerts personnel to the fact that the assets they are handling/or documents are
   associated with classified assets, not that the documents are classified.
   A6.2.4. Local Document Flow Procedures. Munitions Supervision/MASO must ensure
   that document control and flow procedures are further defined in a local operating instruction
   (OI) to include:
       A6.2.4.1. Responsibilities and procedures for munitions work centers to process CAS
       transactions using automated-, direct-, and remote-input methods to achieve near-real
       time processing requirements.
       A6.2.4.2. Procedures for routing, sequence, and timelines for specific documents and
       maximum processing times at each operational node. Documents exceeding these
       timelines will be considered outstanding. All outstanding documents will be reviewed at
       the weekly scheduling meeting.
       A6.2.4.3. Procedures to ensure that all receipts, expenditure requests, and turn-in
       requests are routed to Document Control for filing within 10 duty days of processing.
       Procedures will also ensure that all issue documents are routed to Document Control for
       filing within 10 duty days after the custodian has signed for the assets.
       A6.2.4.4. Procedures to ensure that all shipment documents are routed to Document
       Control for filing no later than 5 duty days after the shipment departs station.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                          289

   A6.2.5. A5J Document Procedures. Print hard copy or electronic A5J document for DLA
   Disposition Services to enter printed name, organization and sign Block 22 “Received By”
   and date Block 23 “Date Received” on the DD Form 1348-1A. If the DLA Disposition
   Services is located off-station and assets are entered into transportation channels, required
   information will be entered in Block 22 and Block 23 of the DD Form 1348-1A. Ensure
   appropriate certification procedures are followed IAW T.O. 11A-1-60.
NOTE: The demilitarization statement is only signed by the demilitarization official and the
witness. DLA Disposition Services officials do not sign the demilitarization statement on the
DD Form 1348-1.
   A6.2.6. Document Monitoring Procedures. The Print Document List (AME02A) shall be
   used to monitor/record the status of all CAS generated documents. Review this report
   weekly to determine status and document location of all CAS generated documents.
   Maintain the latest weekly copy of the MASO signed report IAW the AF RDS.
A6.3. Management of Document Files and Records. The MASO will be designated the Chief
of the Office of Record (COR) and shall appoint Records Custodians (RC) IAW AFI 33-322,
Records Management Program.
   A6.3.1. The MASO appointed RCs will coordinate with the unit records manager, the local
   information security manager and/or the local area network administrators to ensure that
   electronically maintained records have security permissions applied to prevent unauthorized
   alteration, movement or deletion of the files or documents.
   A6.3.2. A Munitions Document Control file plan will be established IAW paragraph
   A6.8.1.
   A6.3.3. The MASO must ensure the following documents/records are maintained and filed
   as indicated:

       A6.3.3.2. Auditable Transactions/Documents. These transactions/documents include
       accountable transactions/documents and other transactions that change/document
       transaction history, but do not increase/decrease the DoDAAC stock account balances.
       Auditable documents will be maintained and filed IAW the AF RDS, and include:
          A6.3.3.2.1. Custody Inventory count sheets and signed account listings.
          A6.3.3.2.2. DoDAAC stock inventory count sheets and results memorandums
          (inventory package).
NOTE: An inventory package that results in an IAD would be filed with the accountable IAD as
supporting documentation.
          A6.3.3.2.3. The AF IMT 2434 is used as a management tool to assist the MASO in
          validating accuracy of previously processed CAS flightline expenditure transactions.
          Once the MASO validation is completed, the form may be routed to the PGM shop
          for documentation of PGM flight-hour reporting and tracking in TMRS.
       A6.3.3.3. Non-Accountable Supporting Documentation. These documents are not
       accountable or auditable, but are used to initiate processes, provided authorization or

1. If an item is classified, the person receiving the property must be authorized in writing to receipt
for classified property. This may be accomplished via the AF Form 68.
2. If an item is classified, the words "Classified Item" (in red, bold, capital letters) will be included
on all source documents.
3. Munitions shipments using transportation channels will have the authorized Transportation
representative’s "signature/printed name" in block 22 and "Date" in block 23. If munitions personnel
transport munitions, the receiving activity will sign, print name, and date in place of Transportation.
4. The DLA Disposition Services representative will enter printed name, organization and sign
Block 22 “Received By” and date Block 23 “Date Received” on the DD Form 1348-1A. If the DLA
Disposition Services is located off-station and assets are entered into transportation channels,
required information will be entered in Block 22 and Block 23 of the DD Form 1348-1A. Refer to
paragraph 3.13.11 and paragraph A6.2.5 for demilitarization/disposal certification requirements.
Ensure appropriate certification procedures are followed IAW T.O. 11A-1-60.
5. Verify document number, lot number, S/N, CAT Code (if applicable), and CC. For DIFM/FOB
turn-in use lot number of the item being turned-in. MASO signature is required only on FOB turn-
ins.
6. The disposition and witnessing official will sign, print name and date above the respective
statements, "Demilitarization / Disposition Official" and "Witnessing Official". If the
demilitarization official has certified that demilitarization has been accomplished and the DLA
Disposition Services requires the residual material be downgraded to scrap, ensure that the stock
number is circled and the word SCRAP is entered on the DD Form 1348-1A.
7. When the received quantity is different from the shipped quantity the In-checker will circle the
quantity on document, enter new quantity and initial. Check the transaction quantity to be sure the
correct quantity received was processed.
8. ISU to 920RW will have ADR number cross-referenced on CAS documentation, if applicable.
Custodian or Inspector signatures are not required if EOD signs as certifying/performing DEMIL and
viewing/witnessing DEMIL.
9. Annotate transaction number on the document from the CAS transaction history listing (AM903
only).
10. For assets released to agencies or individuals outside the AF, appropriate documents will be
annotated as required by paragraph 9.5 and 9.6.
11. On DD Form 1348-1A, the In-checker will sign and print name in block 22 if space permits;
otherwise sign block 22 and print name immediately below signature, and enter date in block 23. If
blocks 22 and 23 already contain a signature from the shipper ensure “In-check / Received By”,
signature, printed name and date is immediately below blocks 22 and 23. On DD Form 1149, the In-
checker will sign, print name and date block 19. In-checkers are authorized to sign DD Form 250,
Block 22 (Receiver’s Use) to receipt for direct vendor deliveries (DVD) from contract facilities. Re-
creation of other shipping documents is not required.
12. Process and validate expenditures IAW paragraph 7.18.
13. Signatures are not required when the shipment was cancelled prior to Date Departed Origin
(DDO) update; the document may be discarded.

A6.5. Reverse Post (RVP) Document Procedures. The MASO will review RVP actions daily.
A brief explanation will be entered in the remarks section of the CAS generated RVP (This field
 294                                                                AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014


is limited to 100 characters). If additional space is required, use reverse side of RVP document
or separate memorandum. Route and file RVP document with all supporting documents.
A6.6. Paperwork Transaction Only (PTO). PTO are authorized for assets that have departed
station as a result of deployment when time did not allow prior processing of documents, custody
turn-ins/issues for CAT Code changes, or as approved by the MASO.
   A6.6.1. Ensure that a PTO turn-in document and the shipment document that removes assets
   from record cross-reference one another. For deployments, annotate the deployment name
   and/or number on the turn-in/shipping document. PTO will not be used to adjust accountable
   records as a result of inventory discrepancies or other errors under any circumstance. See
   paragraph 2.6.22.
   A6.6.2. Munitions operations will ensure the custodian is notified of turn-ins/issues
   concerning CAT Code changes prior to actions being processed using PTO procedures. The
   MASO must only use CAS program Manual Record Processing (AMC05) to correct invalid

A6.8. Creation and Configuration of the Munitions Document Control File Plan and
Project File.
   A6.8.1. The Munitions Document Control File Plan. The COR, Records Custodians
   (RCs), and Functional Area Records Manager (FARM) will establish an electronic file plan
   for the Munitions Document Control “Project File” within AFRIMS.
       A6.8.1.1. This file plan will not be combined with any other Munitions Accountability
       element or other unit file plans. The file plan will support the Munitions Document
       Control project file which will be used to maintain all accountable/auditable munitions
       records and supporting documentation. Follow the procedures below to create and
       configure the file plan:
       A6.8.1.2. The Munitions Document Control file plan will reside on Air Force approved
       media IAW the Air Force Electronic Records Management (ERM) Solution Using
       Existing Resources Guide. Use this guide to control all accountable documents. This
       guide is available under 'Help | Related Links' in AFRIMS or at the link identified in
       paragraph 1.4.19.
       A6.8.1.3. The FARM will establish a designated area within the unit ERM solution for
       the Munitions Document Control project file.
AFI21-201 9 APRIL 2014                                                                      295


       A6.8.1.4. The FARM will ensure the project file is located in an area on your
       organizational network where authorized munitions personnel have read/view access to
       the files.
       A6.8.1.5. Contact the unit Information Assurance Officer (IAO) with names of the
       MASO (COR) and RCs along with their Common Access Card (CAC) ID numbers so the
       IAO can send a “Permissions Group Update” email to your MAJCOM Enterprise Service
       Desk (ESD) with the file locations server ID string to created/update the access
       permissions.
       A6.8.1.6. RCs will enter/configure the newly created file plan structure in AFRIMS
       using the examples outlined in paragraph A6.8.2.
       A6.8.1.7. RCs will create the Munitions Document Control project file in the designated
       area of the unit ERM solution as outlined in paragraphs A6.8.3 and A6.8.4.
       A6.8.1.8. RCs will transfer all existing Document Control electronic records to the
       appropriate folders within the Munitions Document Control project file and begin
       permanently filing new records within the file. Ensure records follow the naming
       conventions outlined in paragraph A6.8.5.
       A6.8.1.9. RCs will create disposition control labels from AFRIMS for records
       maintained within the Munitions Document Control project file as outlined in paragraph
       A6.8.6.
       A6.8.1.10. RCs will ensure all munitions records have a digital signature applied to
       preserve document integrity as outlined in paragraph A6.9.
       A6.8.1.11. RCs will maintain records in inactive status for the timeframe outlined in the
       applicable AF RDS table and rule.
       A6.8.1.12. RCs will maintain software and hardware capable of reading records
       throughout their lifecycle.
   A6.8.2. AFRIMS File Plan Configuration. Create a designated file plan within AFRIMS
   for the Munitions Document Control file. This file plan is separate from and will not be
   combined with the Munitions Accountability element or other unit file plans. Follow the
   below procedures to create the file plan and maintain records IAW the AF RDS table and
   rules within AFRIMS.
       A6.8.2.1. Create AFRIMS user accounts for the COR and RCs.
       A6.8.2.2. Assign Munitions Document Control file plan management privileges to the
       newly created COR and RC accounts.
       A6.8.2.3. Create Item 1 and Item 2 as shown in Figures A6.1, AFRIMS File Plan
       Configuration – Items 1 and 2 and Table A6.2, AFRIMS File Plan Configuration,
       Document Control (Item 2) Subdivisions.

A6.9. Record Integrity and Preservation. Electronically filed munitions records will have
digital signature(s) applied to preserve document integrity. Personnel involved in the record
generation process may apply digital signatures during record generation. RCs and appointed
munitions document control personnel shall apply digital signatures during record filing or media
upgrade/conversion to preserve record integrity as necessary.
   A6.9.1. Media upgrade/conversion is authorized when technology obsolescence or
   operational constraints prevent digital signature revalidation in the existing format. RCs and
   munitions document control personnel will:
       A6.9.1.1. Ensure the existing digital signature(s) are valid prior to media conversion.
       A6.9.1.2. Ensure the printed name of electronic signer(s), as well as the date when the
       signature was executed, be included as part of any human readable form (such as
       electronic display or printout) of the converted media format.
       A6.9.1.3. Apply a digital signature to the upgraded/converted record certifying record
       integrity is preserved.
