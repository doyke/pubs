Section A—Program Review

1. Command Responsibilities. Major commands (MAJCOM), including the Air National
Guard (ANG), Field Operating Agencies (FOA), and Direct Reporting Units (DRUs), must
ensure all eligible Security Forces units and individuals, both military and civilian, have the
opportunity to compete in their respective categories. Future references to MAJCOMs pertain to
above categories.
   1.1. (Added-ACC) HQ ACC/A7S ensures eligible Security Forces units and individuals,
   military and civilian, have the opportunity to compete for awards in their respective
   categories. Nominations for unit awards are limited to Security Forces Squadrons. See para
   8., Nominating Procedures, for eligibility for individual award nominations.
2. Evaluation Period. Fiscal year (1 October through 30 September) for individual awards;
calendar year (1 January through 31 December) is the evaluation period for unit awards.

3. How to Submit Awards. All MAJCOMs will submit their nominees for the AF-level board
using formats in Attachments 2 and 3. Forward nominee packages via e-mail to the HQ
AFSFC/SFM. Nomination packages for individual awards must arrive no later than 15
November of the nomination year. Nomination packages for unit awards must arrive no later
than 15 February following the nomination year.
NOTE: Security Forces personnel assigned to contingency operations on a permanent party
basis will submit their nominees through their assigned NAF to the MAJCOM of responsibility.
     3.1. (Added-ACC) Submit nomination packages for both unit and individual awards via e-
     mail to the HQ ACC Awards Manager identified in the annual solicitation. Suspense dates
     will also be identified in the annual solicitation. Use AF-standard office software to prepare
     the nominations.
     3.2. (Added-ACC) Packages that fail to meet established suspense may be penalized by 5
     points in Duty Accomplishment and 2 points each in Base and Community Involvement and
     Significant Self-Improvement.
     3.3. (Added-ACC) Non Security Forces units (Inspector General, RED HORSE units,
     Rescue Squadrons, Special Tactics Squadrons, Naval Air Station Sigonella) who have
     permanently assigned Security Forces personnel executing Security Forces duties will send
     nomination packages through their respective commanders (wing commander equivalent or
     higher). Wings should not hold local boards to select winners; the first level of competition
     for squadron or Geographically Separated Unit nominees should be Headquarters Air
     Combat Command Security Forces (HQ ACC/A7S).
4. Command-Level Selection Boards. Command-level selection boards consist of senior
Security Forces officers, noncommissioned officers, and civilians at the discretion of the
MAJCOM.
     4.1. (Added-ACC) Command-level selection boards. The ACC A7S or designee appoints
     officers, noncommissioned officers, and civilians to serve on selection boards. Boards will
     (as a minimum) have one individual who is senior in grade to individuals being evaluated.
     Board members will review and score each package in their assigned category before the
     board convenes. The board will meet to determine the winners and, in case of a tie, the board
     president will cast the deciding vote.
5. Air Force Selection Boards. Per AFPD 36-28, Awards and Decorations Programs, a
general officer or civilian equivalent will chair. The Air Force Director of Security Forces
appoints senior Security Forces officers, noncommissioned officers, and civilians to the board.
HQ AFSFC/SFM will serve as the board administrator.
