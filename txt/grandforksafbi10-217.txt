This instruction explains local policy, procedures, and responsibilities for the Resource Augmentation
Duty Program at Grand Forks Air Force Base. The READY Program is designed to meet the temporary
personnel shortages of local commanders caused by situations or conditions that require the realignment
of existing personnel resources during exercise, contingency, emergency, or wartime conditions. The
READY Review Board (RRB) approves and prioritizes requirements. This publication applies to all
officer and enlisted personnel assigned to Grand Forks AFB.


1. Program Mission. The READY Program identifies, places, codes, and trains personnel to meet aug-
mentee needs for installation-level exercises, contingencies, wartime, or emergency situations/scenarios.

2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. The RRB.
       2.1.1. Board Members: The chairperson (319 ARW/CV), 319 OG/CC, 319 LG/CC, 319 SPTG/
       CC, 319 MDG/CC, and 319 ARW/DS.
       2.1.2. Board Advisors: 319 ARW/MO (Manpower Office) or designated representative, 319
       MSS/CC or designated representative, and a representative from each READY augmentee user
       (augmented function).
       2.1.3. The RRB will ensure all local, validated augmentation needs are met, ensure training is
       conducted by users, meet at least annually, or more often as needed, to prioritize requirements and
       identify available resources, approve augmentation requirements and exemptions, task groups to
       fill augmentation requirements, and consider redistribution of taskings or shortfalls submitted by
       tasked groups.

    2.2. The Military Personnel Flight (MPF) Personnel Employment Section, provides monthly-auto-
    mated computer products for users and tasked groups to help commanders manage resources, and
    maintains an accurate listing of all READY users and group monitors.
    2.3. Each augmenting Squadron Commander’s Support Staff updates READY status codes in the Per-
    sonnel Data System for non-Personnel Concept III (PC-III) units, provides monthly automated com-
    puter products for tasked squadrons to help commanders and READY POCs manage resources.
    2.4. READY requirements are validated by 319 ARW/MO and approved by the RRB. Available per-
    sonnel resources are identified and validated for all participating base organizations based on eligibil-
    ity criteria and exemptions.
    2.5. Logistics Plans Office is a coordinating agency and will be provided monthly READY reports by
    the MPF Personnel Employment Section for deployment documentation and archiving purposes.
    2.6. READY users will:
       2.6.1. Appoint a READY coordinator.
       2.6.2. Coordinate with 319 ARW/MO to validate augmentee requirements.
       2.6.3. Work with group READY monitors to ensure tasked units provide augmentees as approved
       by the RRB.
       2.6.4. Ensure augmentees are issued required equipment and clothing (Attachment 3 and
       Attachment 4).
       2.6.5. Train augmentees.
       2.6.6. Develop and maintain a READY training record (electronic or hard copy) on each augmen-
       tee upon appointment.
       2.6.7. Provide a copy of the folder or electronic record to the augmentee’s group monitor to main-
       tain for informational purposes after completion of initial training (make available to the READY
       monitors access to the READY database maintained by 319th Transportation Squadron for those
       requirements).
       2.6.8. Make available a copy of augmentees training record to READY monitors when individu-
       als are relieved of duties.
       2.6.9. Report status of augmentee training and vacancies to the RRB.
       2.6.10. Notify group READY monitors of which augmentees are required when call-ups are initi-
       ated.
    2.7. Each group READY monitor will maintain a record on each assigned augmentee within their
    group to track augmentee contributions to the READY program, review computer generated READY
    roster(s) provided by 319 MSS/DPMA monthly, realign resources under the given scenario to deter-
    mine personnel overages and shortages, acknowledge their respective taskings 5 duty days prior to
    each RRB. If they cannot meet that timeline, provide rationale with specific justification on why they
    cannot support their tasking, and ensure their respective augmentation taskings are filled. The group
    READY monitor will ensure training is accomplished by requesting training from the user for each
    augmentee requiring training via an email, Training Request and Completion form, ensure augment-
    ees are issued basic cold weather gear and any other required items (Attachment 3 and Attachment
    4), and release augmentees when call-ups are initiated. Those group READY monitors working with

   the TRANS READY monitor will have access to the TRANS READY database to facilitate group
   READY augmentee record updates.

3. Using the READY Program.
   3.1. When to use the program. Augmentation means using people in other than their assigned Air
   Force Specialty Code (AFSC) duties. After unit commanders (who are seeking augmentees) exhaust
   their military personnel resource pool, it is highly recommended they look next at their civilian work
   force to see if there are skilled and/or trained volunteers within their organization prior to tasking
   civilians to accomplish READY duties.
   3.2. Establishing and implementing augmentation requirements: READY requirements are validated
   by 319 ARW/MO and approved by the RRB. Available personnel resources are identified and vali-
   dated for all participating base organizations. Resources will be sourced within the parent-designated
   group. For example, 319th Transportation Squadron READY requirements will be sourced from
   within the 319th Logistics Group. The only exception is the 319th Medical Group will provide aug-
   mentees for requirements within the 319th Logistics Group.
      3.2.1. Consideration of local needs/conditions. Give top priority to augmentation required for
      wartime, contingency, natural disaster, humanitarian, and exercise.
      3.2.2. Units using augmentees decide what they need to do and train them. Augmented units will
      fund for required training. When military personnel are selected for a Permanent Change of Sta-
      tion (PCS) or approved for separation or retirement, the augmentee will hand-carry the Ready
      Training Record (RTR) to the MPF. The RTR is then given to the member if he/she is separating
      or retiring or the MPF should include the RTR in the member’s PCS package.
      3.2.3. Each augmentee will have at least 12 months retainability and will remain an augmentee
      until a replacement is identified and trained. Replacing augmentees for reasons other than PCS,
      separation, or retirement is highly discouraged and requires a letter endorsed by the squadron
      commander who is providing the augmentee and the squadron commander who is augmented.
      Replacements will be identified and trained NLT 30 days prior to the scheduled departure date of
      an augmentee.
   3.3. Using augmentees. Units will consider not assigning personnel previously committed to fill a
   Unit Type Code (UTC) to the READY Program. Do not deploy READY-trained people in their
   READY duty. They may be dispatched from their home station to assist with off-base (or off-installa-
   tion) emergencies whenever the use of DOD personnel is properly authorized.
      3.3.1. Individuals in upgrade training should be exempt from performing long-term, continuous
      READY duties but as a last resort may perform long-term, continuous READY duties not to
      exceed 90 days.

4. How the READY Program Status Code System Works.
   4.1. READY Program Status Codes. The READY Program status code is used to identify a military
   member who has been trained as a READY augmentee. The READY status code is not an AFSC and
   is not used as a basis for promotion, assignment, retraining, or mobility deployment. READY Codes
   cannot be maintained on Federal civilian employees in the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System
   (DCPDS). Their information will be contained in the RTF. Installations may keep this data updated on
   a local system.

    4.2. Central Table 181. Base Level Military Personnel System (BLMPS) Central Table 181 identifies
    specific READY Program status codes.
    4.3. Updating Codes in BLMPS.
       4.3.1. There are three occurrences in each enlisted and two occurrences in each officer personnel
       data record which permit the simultaneous tracking of augmentation programs. The BLMPS has
       four data identification numbers (DINs) that make up the data elements for one READY program.
       The existence of a READY code does not imply augmentation requirements exist at each installa-
       tion.
           4.3.1.1. The first DIN, EK2 (READY-PROGRAM-ID), contains a two digit program code,
           listed by general category with breakdowns under each general category.
           4.3.1.2. The second DIN, EK3 (READY-TNG-YR-MO), contains a four digit numeric code,
           READY Program Trained-Year-Month: EXAMPLE: (READY-TNG-YR-MO) (YYMM)
           9506 = June 1995.
           4.3.1.3. The third DIN, EK4 (READY-ACTIVE-STATUS), contains a one digit status code.
           Status Code: Active Augmentee - NO 1, Active Augmentee - YES 2.
           4.3.1.4. The fourth DIN, EK5 (DATE-ASSIGNED-AUGMENTATION-DUTY), contains a
           four digit numeric code, READY Program Assigned-Year-Month.
       4.3.2. All entries pertaining to a particular occurrence are automatically deleted if DIN EK3,
       READY-TNG-YR-MO, is not updated within a 5-year period; and EK4, READY-ACTIVE-STA-
       TUS, equals code 1.
       4.3.3. READY-ACTIVE-STATUS code 2 is automatically converted to 1 upon input of any per-
       sonnel transaction identifier, which gains a member to file. DIN EK3, READY-TNG-YR-MO
       remains the same.
