                                           Chapter 1

                                         OVERVIEW

1.1. Overview. This instruction establishes responsibilities and operating procedures for vehicle
operations on the Incirlik AB (IAB) airfield. Airfield driving is for official use only, with
maximum attention paid to safety and accident prevention. Drivers may not deviate from
procedures or principles set forth in this instruction except in the interest of safety. Airfield
safety is paramount; conscientious and safe driving can prevent most accidents. The
requirements of this instruction must be included in the unit’s self-inspection program if
personnel perform airfield driving duties. A Unit Self-Inspection Checklist is included as
Attachment 4.
1.2. Goal of Airfield Driving Program. The goal of the Airfield Driving Program (ADP) is to
maintain a safe flying environment. The irresponsible use of motor vehicles on the airfield
presents a clear and definite danger, both to aircraft and ground personnel. Carelessness, haste
and disregard for established safety standards are the primary sources of aircraft-vehicle
incidents.
1.3. Standards and Requirements. The standards set in this publication apply to all motor
vehicles on the airfield. Only properly trained and certified personnel will drive on the IAB
airfield. All personnel operating a vehicle on the airfield must be knowledgeable of and must
comply with this instruction. In addition, they must be trained on local driving procedures and
possess a valid AF IMT 483, Certificate of Competency. The AF IMT 483 must be issued and
endorsed by the 39th Operations Support Squadron, Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS)
in order to be valid. This requirement applies to military and civilian employees assigned to,
visiting, contracted or on temporary duty to IAB, and to all types of vehicles, i.e., military,
commercial and private owned. If personnel or contractors that do not have a valid AF IMT 483
an escort is required.
1.4. OPR. This instruction does not address every possible airfield driving scenario. Contact
AMOPS at 676-6156/7 if you have any questions or require clarification.

                                           Chapter 4

                    OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Safe vehicle operations on the airfield are absolutely essential. Vehicles present a
   clear and definite danger to aircraft and ground personnel. Aircraft will always have the
   right-of-way. Human error (e.g. carelessness, haste and disregard for established safety
   standards, etc.) is the primary cause for High Accident Potential (HAP) incidents,
   aircraft/vehicle mishaps and injury on the airfield. Therefore, vehicle operations on the
   airfield must be kept to a minimum.
      4.1.1.1. In joint use scenarios (USAF personnel and Turkish Air Force (TURAF)
      personnel, e.g. 39 SFS), regardless or rank, the USAF airfield driver is the airfield driving
      authority.
      4.1.1.2. Blackout Procedures are not applicable at Incirlik AB.
   4.1.2. Using the airfield for convenience is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not
   limited to, using the airfield as a traffic short cut, parking unauthorized vehicles around
   hangars and other airfield buildings, physical exercise on the airfield, etc.
   4.1.3. Units sponsoring TDY personnel (e.g. 39 SFS) or non base-assigned contractors are
   responsible for providing local airfield driving training or provide an escort with a valid
   Incirlik AF IMT 483.
   4.1.4. All qualified airfield drivers must have their current AF IMT 483, valid GMV license
   (if applicable), valid civilian driving license and an Incirlik-issued AF Form 1199C (if
   applicable) in their possession while driving on the airfield.
   4.1.5. Seat belts must be properly worn by all passengers, if available. Passengers shall not
   ride on any part of moving equipment not designed specifically for passengers.
   4.1.6. See Attachment 15 for Airfield Signs and Markings.
4.2. Controlled Movement Area (CMA) Operations.
   4.2.1. CMA Operations. No airfield drives or pedestrian may enter the CMA, without
   specific approval from the ATCT via two-way radio communications. Alternative methods
   for obtaining CMA access (e.g., landline, cellular phones, Turkish frequencies, etc.) are not
   authorized. Use of TURAF procedures as a means to circumvent USAF airfield driving
   CMA standards is strictly prohibited. ATCT approval to proceed into or cross the CMA is
   not a guarantee that the conflict will be avoided. Airfield Drivers are expected to visually
   check for approaching aircraft and vehicles, in all directions, prior to proceeding on or across
   these areas. Airfield drivers are required to have a current airfield diagram, AFVA 11-240
   and AFVA 13-222 stickers affixed in their government vehicles while operating on the
   airfield.
      4.2.1.1. All vehicles operating in the CMA must use rotating beacon lights or hazard
      flashers at all times.
INCIRLIKABI13-213 12 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                           23


     4.2.1.2. Airfield drivers and pedestrians operating on the CMA are required to maintain
     two-way radio communication with ATCT, via Ramp Net, at all times. EXCEPTION:
     Fire Department shall use the Fire Net on designated frequency and shall notify ATCT to
     monitor the Fire Net. All ATCT instructions must be read back verbatim. Vehicles
     operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent radio mounted in the
     vehicle to communicate with ATCT. Handheld radios should be used only as a backup or
     when communicating with ATCT from outside the vehicle. Perform an operational radio
     check with ATCT prior to entering the airfield.
     4.2.1.3. Distinct vehicle, call signs must be utilized. Refer to Attachment 14 for a list of
     unit call signs. Coordinate with the WADPM for approval to use call sign not listed.
     Call sign cannot include wording used from ATCT phraseology (e.g. “Taxi“, “Clear”,
     etc.). Call signs must remain professional and in good taste (e.g. no profanity, slander,
     etc.).
     4.2.1.4. Stationary vehicles in the CMA shall be positioned facing ATCT to the
     maximum extent possible. Notify ATCT when vehicle positioning towards ATCT is not
     possible.
     4.2.1.5. Personnel working on foot are required to maintain handheld radio contact with
     ATCT and vehicle keys left in the ignition.
     4.2.1.6. When given CMA exit instructions, acknowledge and exit at the nearest access
     point. If given “Expedite” instructions, acknowledge and exit at the nearest access point
     as fast and safe as possible. All airfield drivers shall notify ATCT after exiting the CMA.
  4.2.2. Airfield Closures. The WADPM notifies UADPMs through the monthly ADP
  bulletin of upcoming airfield closures. UADPMs shall notify their unit’s airfield drivers of
  the upcoming airfield closure. During airfield closures, qualified airfield drivers may cross
  the runway only by using the following procedures:
     4.2.2.1. Ensure the runway is not active by attempting to call ATCT three times. If no
     response, contact AM via Ramp Net radio or phone.
     4.2.2.2. After exhausting all listed means during the published closure periods, look both
     ways and proceed with caution.
  4.2.3. Runway Access/Crossing Procedures. Vehicles requesting permission onto/across the
  runway shall be restricted to mission-essential operations only. During flying operations, the
  preferred crossing point is the departure end. Blanket approval (i.e. unconditional
  instructions) is not authorized. All other vehicles will utilize the November Taxiway, Sierra
  Taxiway, Perimeter Road and Flightline Road. If instructed to “hold short” of the runway by
  ATCT, airfield drivers shall hold short of the runway at the CMA access points identified in
  paragraph 4.4.2 When instructed to proceed onto/across the runway, read back instructions
  verbatim and report to ATCT when off the runway and past the VFR Hold Line (Figure 4.1)
  or the ILS Hold Line (Figure 4.2) and the non-standard CMA Stop Line (Figure 4.3).
  Vehicles with POV passes shall be restricted to crossing the runway at Taxiways Alpha and
  Echo. Contractor vehicles, working on the airfield with approved POV passes, are restricted
  to accessing/crossing the runway at the closest taxiway to the construction site.

       4.2.3.2. Emergency Removal of Vehicles and Pedestrians from the CMA. In the event
       ATCT loses radio communication with vehicles in the CMA, the ATCT will flash the
       runway edge lights on and off at the highest setting to alert airfield driver’s/pedestrians
       that there is a problem and/or emergency requiring their immediate exit out of the CMA.
       All vehicles/pedestrians exiting the CMA shall notify the ATCT when out of the CMA.
       All exited airfield drivers shall attempt to re-establish radio communication with ATCT.
       If unable, contact AMOPs via radio or phone and advise that you are off the runway and
       experiencing radio problems. ATCT must inform AM of the incident immediately.
   4.2.4. While Taxiways November (North Parallel) and Sierra (South Parallel) are not within
   the CMA, airfield drivers are required to monitor the Ramp Net for ATCT notifications
   regarding aircraft movement.
4.3. Airfield Evacuation. When notified by competent authority, all airfield drivers shall
evacuate the airfield immediately. If airfield drivers or personnel are aware of any situation
requiring the evacuation of the airfield, notify AM.
4.4. Restricted Areas.

   been established. Contractors without an Incirlik-issued AF Form 1199C will not be allowed
   access anywhere outside of the established Free Zone.
4.5. ATCT Light Gun Signals.
   4.5.1. In the event of radio failure on the airfield, ATCT will utilize light gun signals to
   instruct airfield driver’s movement. All airfield vehicles shall have an AFVA 11-240
   (Figure 4.4) decal affixed in view of the airfield driver or clipped to the inside of the sun
   visor. All qualified airfield drivers must be familiar and comply with ATCT light signals:
       4.5.1.1. Steady Green - Permission to cross, proceed or go.
       4.5.1.2. Steady Red - STOP. Vehicle must not move.
       4.5.1.3. Flashing Red - Exit the taxiway or runway (minimum of 100 feet).

   4.9.1. The taxiway system is designed to provide an orderly flow of aircraft and vehicle
   traffic, eliminating the potential for a mishap.
   4.9.2. Airfield drivers shall utilize the far right side of taxiways. Taxiway centerline driving
   is permitted only if the normal traffic flow is impractical or unsafe (e.g. tow vehicles).
   Airfield drivers shall maintain straight line driving and complete all turns at 90-degree
   angles. Vehicles are prohibited from indiscriminate direction of travel, cutting corners,
   driving on taxiway/runway/ramp shoulders, or moving diagonally across the ramp.
   4.9.3. Airfield drivers shall signal all turns during day and night operations.
   4.9.4. If a taxiway is unusable or blocked (e.g., an aircraft has been pulled forward from the
   normal parking spot to accomplish an engine run), vehicles shall exercise extreme caution
   and proceed around the area in a direct and expeditious manner. Do not drive through a
   hazardous area or between aircraft and hazard cones.
4.10. Vehicle Parking.
   4.10.1. Vehicles can only be left unattended for mission-essential duties and should only
   occur when no other options exist. Transient Alert personnel are exempt from these
   restrictions while performing duties. If an aircraft approaches the area, the airfield driver

Figure 4.6. Aircraft Visual Blind Spots.




   4.11.1. Vehicles shall not be driven directly towards an aircraft when within 25 feet, except
   during approved servicing and/or loading procedures (i.e. towing operations) and shall never
   be driven underneath any part of an aircraft. All vehicles operating within 25 feet of an
   aircraft shall have a spotter.
   4.11.2. Vehicles servicing or loading an aircraft may be left unattended. All vehicles left
   unattended shall be left unlocked, keys in the ignition and the engine off. Unattended
   vehicles shall not block taxiways or other aircraft parking locations.
   4.11.3. The vehicle path should be planned so that if a brake failure occurs, the vehicle shall
   not strike the aircraft. Vehicles parked in front or behind an aircraft shall be parked
   perpendicular to the aircraft with the driver’s side closest to the aircraft. Vehicles parked
   beside an aircraft must be parked parallel to the aircraft. Park so that the vehicle’s front or
   rear shall not face any part of the aircraft.
   4.11.4. Vehicles shall not park or drive within 25 feet in front of or 200 feet behind any
   aircraft whose engines are in operation or being started. Airfield drivers shall not, under any
   circumstances, stand or park in front of or drive into the path of taxiing aircraft or drive
   between an aircraft and its Transient Alert guide vehicle.
   4.11.5. When any aircraft approaches, all vehicles shall exit the area immediately and come
   to a complete stop until the aircraft has passed. If an immediate exit (e.g. hardstand) is not
   available, airfield drivers should attempt to turn around and exit the area as quickly and
   safely as possible.
   4.11.6. Departing the paved surface to ensure clearance from aircraft should only be used as
   a last resort. In the event the airfield driver departs the paved surface, the driver shall
   perform a FOD check upon returning to the paved surface.
   4.11.7. Helicopters are considered taxiing when hovering 100 feet or less above the ground
   or when traversing down a taxiway. Airfield drivers are not allowed to drive under, between
   or around helicopters hovering 100 feet or less.
4.12. Towing Operations.
   4.12.1. Prior to towing, Maintenance Operations Control Center (MOCC) will notify
   AMOPS and provide current aircraft parking location and proposed tow location. AMOPS
   will contact ATCT and request approval and notify MOCC if the tow has been approved or
   denied.
INCIRLIKABI13-213 12 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                             29


       4.12.1.1. Airfield drivers will not approach within 50 feet of an aircraft being towed.
       Any driver who encounters taxi or tow operations shall yield to the aircraft by moving

   routes, based on the nature of the existing situation and conditions. In all cases, airfield
   drivers are responsible for minimizing risk by exercising extreme caution.
   4.13.2. Emergency Response vehicles must obtain ATCT approval prior to entering the
   CMA.
   4.13.3. Secondary response agencies (outlined in paragraph 2.15) shall maintain positions at
   the entrance to each Taxiway, until called forward by the Fire Chief or incident/on-scene
   commander. If CMA access is required, secondary response agencies will obtain approval
   for entry from ATCT prior to proceeding into the emergency area.
   4.13.4. Ground vehicles not supporting the emergency shall remain off of taxiways, the
   runway, and airfield access points until the emergency is terminated. Under no circumstance
   shall a vehicle, proceed in front of an Emergency Response vehicle.
   4.13.5. Non-emergencies include, but are not limited to, maintenance red-ball responses,
   exercises, etc. At no time is speeding permitted for any non-emergency.
   4.13.6. During alert and emergency conditions, all non-essential personnel will withdraw to
   AM or their work control center until the emergency is terminated. The withdrawal of
   contractors will be at the discretion of AM.
4.14. Restricted Visibility and Night Operations.
   4.14.1. During periods of reduced visibility and night operations, vehicle headlights will not
   be pointed towards taxiing aircraft. In order to preserve a pilot’s night vision and to enable
   the aircrew to observe your position, airfield drivers shall turn headlights “off” and parking
   lights “on” until the approaching aircraft has passed.
       4.14.1.1. Ensure your vehicle is clear of an aircraft’s taxi route. Vehicles with daytime
       running lights will stop and park in a safe location, turn off the ignition, set the parking
       brake and activate emergency flashers.
       4.14.1.2. When weather conditions are less than 800 feet or 2 miles visibility the
       instrument hold sign will be utilized. Vehicles are required to stop and request access
       from ATCT into the CMA.

   shall not be operated, unless directed by the 39 ABW Commander. When visibility is less
   than 100 feet, POVs and airfield vehicles, with exception to emergency and alert vehicles,
   will not be operated on the airfield. When the visibility is less than 50 feet, a walking guide,
   equipped with flashing or luminescent wand, must be used during movement of emergency
   and alert vehicles.
   4.14.3. Flashing hazard lights or rotating beacons will be used on all vehicles parked on the
   airfield at night or during periods of poor visibility. See paragraph 4.18 for disabled vehicle
   procedures.
4.15. Obstacles on the Airfield.
   4.15.1. Support equipment may be staged on the ramp three hours prior to the aircraft arrival
   and three hours after the aircraft has departed.            Outside of the prescribed
   operations/maintenance window, all support equipment must be removed from the parking
   area. The use of support equipment on taxiways may only be utilized for the duration of
   mission support and must be promptly removed upon completion of duties.
   4.15.2. Fixed or mobile obstacles (support equipment) not being utilized must remain 164
   feet from taxiway centerlines. Fixed or mobile obstacles (support equipment) must remain
   outside of 984 feet from the runway. AM shall close all locations where a clearance criterion
   from fixed or mobile obstructions is not met.
   4.15.3. Vehicles will not be parked temporarily or allowed to stand in empty aircraft parking
   spots. This requirement does not apply to equipment in established equipment, parking areas
   or pre-positioned for aircraft recovery, which must be parked, clear of roadways and taxi/tow
   lines. During periods when maintenance equipment, work stands and aircraft materials are
   not actually required for work in progress or planned, they shall be removed from the aircraft
   parking area to designated storage locations. Vehicles and equipment must be clearly visible
   from the aircraft flight deck.
4.16. Disabled Vehicles.
   4.16.1. All possible efforts will be made to remove disabled vehicles from aircraft parking
   and movement areas. Such vehicles pose safety hazards and must display emergency
   flashers at all times. The airfield driver will avoid blocking the runway, taxiway or
   roadways. At a minimum, the airfield driver will:
       4.16.1.1. Leave emergency flashers on and remain within the vicinity while seeking help.
       4.16.1.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capabilities, make the following transmission:
       “All parties BREAK, BREAK-This is (call sign) with an emergency for Airfield
       Management and Tower”. State the nature of the problem and report your position on
       the airfield.
       4.16.1.3. Airfield drivers of other radio-equipped vehicles will make every effort to
       assist in removing the disabled vehicle off the airfield, especially if the vehicle is located
       on a ramp, taxiways or runway.
       4.16.1.4. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio, stay with the vehicle and
       continue attempts to alert any taxiing aircraft or other vehicle in the vicinity.

   4.17.2. There are no known radio dead spots on the airfield.
4.18. Procedures for Vehicle Supplemental Traction Control Devices. Tire chains may only
be employed on airfield pavements after obtaining coordination and approval from the AFM,
Safety, and CE. To minimize pavement damage and FOD hazard, requesting agency shall
conduct an operational risk assessment with the above agencies when evaluating the need for tire
chains on the airfield. Studded tires are not authorized.
4.19. Foreign Object Debris (FOD) Control and Prevention.
   4.19.1. All airfield personnel have a responsibility in the FOD Control Program to remove
   FOD from the airfield when found. AM is the focal point for notifying the airfield sweeper
   for all sweeping requests on the airfield. Notify AM of significant FOD on any paved
   operational areas.
   4.19.2. Prior to entering the airfield, all vehicles must perform a rollover FOD check
   removing all FOD from tires. Stop the vehicle at the designated FOD checkpoint or
   immediately after leaving an unpaved area and complete a FOD check. Check all tires, pull
   the vehicle forward so the wheels rotate a half turn and complete another FOD check. Verify
   all external vehicle components are secured, and checked for damaged, worn or loose vehicle
   parts.
       4.19.2.1. If the vehicle is occupied by only the airfield driver, position the vehicle in
       park, turn off the ignition and perform the FOD check. Roll the vehicle forward 2 feet
       and repeat the process again on the newly-exposed tire treads.
       4.19.2.2. If the vehicle is occupied by more than one person, the airfield driver may

         RADIO COMMUNICATIONS PHRASEOLOGY AND TECHNIQUES

5.1. General.
   5.1.1. Radio communication is the leading cause of all runway incursions. It is essential to
   acknowledge each radio communication with controllers verbatim, using the appropriate
   terminology.
   5.1.2. Brevity and clarity are also important factors. Radio transmissions must be kept as
   brief and comprehensible as possible. Controllers must know what you want to do before
   they can properly carry out their control duties. Conversely, airfield drivers must know
   exactly what the controller wants them to do. Maintain vigilance in monitoring ATCT radio
   communication frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating in the CMA.
5.2. Radio Techniques. Proper radio techniques and etiquette are outlined in Attachment 16.
5.3. Phraseology.
   5.3.1. Airfield drivers must contact ATCT each and every time they enter on or exit off of
   the CMA. When proceeding into a CMA, airfield drivers must advise ATCT of three things:
   WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your intentions are. Airfield drivers must
   acknowledge all communications to ensure the message was received. Airfield drivers shall
   always give aircraft and ATCT transmissions priority, unless an emergency exists.
   VHF/UHF transmissions are reserved for the primary use of aircraft and ATCT personnel.
   Never use the words “Clear, Cleared, or Clearance” in radio communications with the tower.
   These words are reserved for communications between the tower and aircraft. Utilize Tables
   5.1 – 5.6 for common runway cross and access phraseology.

Table 5.1. IAB Runway Crossing Phraseology.
VEHICLE OPERATOR: “GROUND, OPS 1.”
ATC:              “OPS 1, GROUND.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR: “GROUND, OPS 1, REQUEST TO CROSS RUNWAY 05/23 AT

                             NORTH CMA.”
   5.3.2. Vehicles must read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time
   for correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if
   you do not understand an instruction, you MUST request ATCT to repeat the last
   transmission. Good communications only occur when each party knows and understands
   what the other is saying.

2. Markings.

       a. Taxiway markings will be retro-reflective yellow painted markings.
       b. Runway markings will be retro-reflective white painted markings. Exceptions to rule are
          runway overrun markings, which will be retro-reflective yellow painted markings.
       c. VFR Hold Line Marking. This marking is defined by its double dashed and double solid
          design and is typically located 100 feet to 250 feet from the near edge of the runway.




       d. Instrument/ILS Hold Line Marking. This marking is defined by a distinct “ladder” design,
          with the letters “INST” positioned on the side closest to the runway. This marking is
          positioned to prevent airfield drivers from entering the Glide Slope Critical Area and
          interfering with an activated instrument landing system.




       e. Non Standard Controlled Movement Area (CMA) Marking. This marking is defined by a
          white bar with red “STOP” lettering spaced across. This marking is positioned to prevent
          airfield drivers from entering the Controlled Movement Area. airfield drivers must contact
          ATCT for permission to cross this marking.




       f.   Restricted Marking. This marking is red in color and is designed to protect a restricted area
            of the airfield. Personnel must have an authorized restricted area badges (AF IMT 1199) in
            their position prior to entering a restricted area through a defined entry control point.
INCIRLIKABI13-213 12 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                       83


        g. Entry Control Point Markings. This marking defines an entry control point into a restricted
           area on an airfield. Personnel must have an authorized restricted area badges (AF IMT 1199)
           in their position prior to entering a restricted area.




        h. Driving Lane Markings. Driving lanes are marked with retro-reflective white paint and are
           designed to appear as a typical roadway.




3. Lighting.

        a. Taxiway edge lights. These lights define the lateral limits and direction of a taxiing route
           (Taxiway).




        b. Runway edge lights. These lights define the lateral and longitudinal limits of the runway
           surface. These lights provide visual guidance during takeoff and landing operations at night
           and under low visibility conditions.




        c. Runway edge light with split yellow/amber. These lights are identical to runway edge lights,
           except that the light is half white and half yellow/amber. This light is designed as a visual,
           cautionary tool to inform aircrews that only 2000 feet of the instrument runway remains. The
84                                                 INCIRLIKABI13-213 12 SEPTEMBER 2014


          yellow/amber portion of the light will be facing the approach end of the runway, with the
          white light facing the departure end of the runway.




     d. Obstruction lights. These red lights are used to define the vertical and horizontal limits of
        natural or manmade objects which are considered a hazard to air navigation. White lights
        may also be used on structures less than 200 feet tall with MAJCOM approval; however,
        these lights shall not be located in clear zones or near the immediate vicinity of the
        runway(s).




     e. Construction lights. These lights are placed on construction barricades to provide visual aid
        of the construction area. These lights will be yellow/amber or red in color and will flash at a
        rate of 55 to 160 flashes per minute.




     f.   Rotating beacon. This lighting system rotates 360 degrees and consists of a single-peaked
          green light and a double-peaked white light. The purpose of this lighting system is to help
          pilots identify the airfield. For example, a double-peaked white light represents a military
          airfield, where a single-peaked white light represents a civil airfield.

     g. Approach lights. This complex, multi-colored lighting system provides visual guidance
        during landing operations at night and under low visibility conditions.




     h. Ballpark light. These white lights are used to illuminate large areas, such as a parking apron.

                                     RADIO TECHNIQUES

a. Listen before transmitting. If other airfield drivers are talking, the keying of another radio will
override the current transmission. Pause and listen. Proceed to transmit your request when
assured no other transmissions are taking place.
b. Think before keying the radio. Know exactly what you need to say before you say it.
c. When keying the radio, keeping it close to your mouth, press and hold the transmission button
and allow a slight delay before speaking your first word. This shall ensure your full transmission
is broadcasted clearly. Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
d. Release the transmission button a few seconds after your last word. If the transmission was
not acknowledged, pause momentarily and repeat again. ATCT may be locating your position
on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or scanning the runway to enable the
request.
e. Be alert to the tones or lack of tones through the radio. Check volume, recheck frequency, and
check to make sure the transmission key is not stuck in the transmit position. Frequency
blockage can occur for extended periods due to unintentional radio operation. This type of
interference is commonly referred to as a “stuck mike” and controllers may refer to it in this
manner when attempting to correct the problem.
f. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the ground
station equipment.
g. Use caution when using a vehicle mounted/handheld radio and operating a vehicle at the same
time. When possible, only use the radio when safely parked.
