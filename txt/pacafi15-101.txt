1. Background. HQ PACAF operates and maintains air forces in the Pacific, and other Air
Force major commands dispatch forces to operate in the Pacific. PACAF weather units provide
peacetime weather services to enhance safety of flight, increase flying training effectiveness,
protect resources and are designed to smoothly transition from everyday peacetime operations to
combat operations and Military Operations Other Than War. With a majority of the AOR
consisting of ocean surface, tropical cyclone impacts to DOD installations are a significant threat
in PACAF. 17 OWS personnel assigned to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) perform
tropical cyclone reconnaissance using data from satellite, radar, and other conventional sources
to execute PACAF’s Executive Agency Responsibility for Tropical Cyclone Reconnaissance.
To ensure maximum exploitation of all USAF owned data sources across the AOR, HQ PACAF
established the Tropical Cyclone Reconnaissance Network (TCRN) providing a construct for
effective management, coordination, and maintenance of systems and procedures supporting
typhoon reconnaissance. The procedures, duties and responsibilities outlined in this instruction
establish standards for consistent weather support throughout the command to include tropical
cyclone operations.
2. HQ PACAF/A3TX (PACAF Weather Branch) Responsibilities. HQ PACAF/A3TX is
responsible through the Operational Support Division (HQ PACAF/A3T) to the Director of
Operations (HQ PACAF/A3/6) for all MAJCOM weather staff responsibilities enumerated in
AFI 15-128. The Weather Branch advises the PACAF Commander, HQ PACAF Directors, and
HQ PACAF Division Chiefs on all aspects of PACAF weather support and operations that affect
PACAF or PACOM forces.         The Weather Branch also carries out these PACAF-unique
responsibilities:
   2.1. Assists with issues concerning PACAF Programming Plan, OPLAN, CONPLAN and
   strategic vision.
   2.2. Provides HQ PACAF weather functional coordination with USPACOM, USARPAC,
   SOCPAC and PACFLT.
   2.3. Assists PACAF staff agencies and PACAF weather units in documenting weather
   support requirements and environmental sensitivities of emerging acquisition programs.
   2.4. Evaluates technical requirements and arranges environmental support for PACAF

3. Combined METOC Officer (CMO), Senior METOC Officer (SMO), Staff Weather
Officer (SWO), Joint METOC Officer (JMO) Designations.
    3.1. The Joint Forces Commander will appoint a JMO in accordance with Joint Publication
    3-59 when required to support their operations. Actual SMO, SWO and typical JMO
    designations for PACAF assigned weather units are as follows:
       3.1.1. 611 AOC. The 611 AOC/Weather Support Team (WST) OIC, Joint Base
       Elmendorf-Richardson, AK, is the SWO to the 11 AF/CC, JMO for Alaskan Command
       (ALCOM), and typically serves as the JMO to the Commander, JTF-Alaska.
       3.1.2. OL-A, Det 3, 1WS. OL-A, Det 3, 1 WS OIC, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson,
       AK, is the SWO for US Army Alaska (USARAK).
       3.1.3. Det 1, 1 WS. Det 1, 1 WS Commander at Ft Shafter, HI, is the SWO for US Army
       Pacific Command (USARPAC), to include the Main Command Post (MCP). In their
       capacity as a COCOM Army Service Component SWO, Det 1, 1 WS has above the line
       responsibilities similar to a MAJCOM such as coordinating and ensuring United States
       Army weather support needs are identified and captured in appropriate PACOM and
       subordinate command Time Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD). While
PACAFI15-101 23 APRIL 2014                                                                    5


      assigned to 1 WS, these duties impact more than 1 WS and to be effective, require direct
      coordination with the HQ PACAF weather functional staff, USARPAC contingency and
      crisis action planners, 607 WS, and PACOM AOR OPLAN tasked CONUS Battlefield
      Weather Squadrons (BWSs) via HQ ACC/A3W staff.
      3.1.4. 374 OSS/OSW. The weather flight commander of the 374 OSS/OSW, Yokota AB,
      Japan, is also the SWO to 5 AF and the JMO for US Forces Japan.
      3.1.5. OL-A, Det 1, 1 WS. OL-A, Det 1, 1 WS, NCOIC, Camp Zama, Japan, is the
      SWO to US Army Japan.
      3.1.6. 607 WS. The 607 WS/CC, USAG Yongsan, Korea, is the SWO for USFK, and
      typically serves as JMO for operations and exercises focused on the Korean Peninsula.
      Duties require coordination with the COMUNC/CFC CMO, which is the commander of
      the 736 CWS (ROKAF). The 607 WS/DO is the SWO to Commander, 8th Army.
      3.1.7. 7 AF. The 7 AF Chief of Weather Operations, Osan AB, Republic of Korea, is the
      SWO to the Commander, 7 AF (AFKOR) and the Air Component SWO. If this position
      is vacant, this responsibility will be assumed by the 607 AOC WST OIC.
      3.1.8. 1 WS. The 1 WS/CC, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA is the SWO for U.S. Army
      I Corps at JBLM.
      3.1.9. PACAF/A3TX, Chief, Weather Operations, is also JMO for JTF-SFA (Support
      Forces Antarctica).
4. Weather Support Employment.
   4.1. The effective employment of air forces requires consideration of weather factors from
   planning to execution. Weather information provided to the various organizational elements
   must support their decision-making processes and follow current regulatory guidance.
   4.2. Sources of Weather Support. The OL, WF, Det, OWS, WS and strategic centers such as
   the JTWC are directed to be the primary sources for operational support. Installation units
   and agencies are permitted to use various host nation and/or civilian agencies and sources to
   obtain weather information required for their operations. Though direct contact between
   USAF supported units and indigenous weather personnel is permitted, supported units must
   realize that indigenous weather personnel may not be able to provide all the support they
   require, and be made aware of reachback options. Additionally, host nation weather
   personnel may not have access to U.S. Forces’ forecasts and other weather products
   produced specifically for DOD operations and may not be knowledgeable of mission-critical
   weather thresholds. There is also no mechanism available to enforce host nation weather
   support arrangements unless formally documented in an official Memorandum of
   Understanding International (MOUI).
   4.3. Lead Weather Unit. PACAF has unique challenges in determining the Lead Weather
   Unit (LWU) to ensure appropriate weather support is provided per AFMAN 15-129V2, para
   1.8.
      4.3.1. Air Mobility Division (AMD), 613th Air & Space Operations Center (613 AOC)
      controls intra-theater tanker and airlift aircraft and is supported by the 17 OWS as the
      regional weather hub. 17 OWS acts as LWU for these missions.
 6                                                              PACAFI15-101 23 APRIL 2014


        4.3.2. Other theater aircraft movements in the Pacific are controlled by HQ PACAF or
        HQ ACC’s Air Operations Squadron (AOS). Movements controlled by HQ ACC’s AOS
        (Coronet, Bomber, E3s) will be supported by ACC Air Operations Weather Flight.
        PACAF weather units will use ACC AOS/AOSW prepared briefing information available
        on                                    their                                   website
        https://ows.scott.af.mil/TECH_REF/KLFI_UPLOAD/index.cfm?UID=10&BW=H&
        UF=M&AOR=1 to prepare/present any weather support/briefings for these missions. (T-
        1)
        4.3.3. Installation weather unit and OWS support to Integrated Flight Managed (IFM)
        missions. The 17 OWS will ensure Installation Data Pages (IDPs) with supported
        weather units that have IFM mission aircraft assigned to their installation (host or tenant
        unit) define whom the Lead Weather Unit (LWU) is in accordance with AFMAN 15-
        129V2. The defined support should not require the host weather unit to extend their duty
        hours to provide this support unless acting in a backup capacity for the 17 OWS. Local
        weather units (typically WFs, Dets, OLs) with IFM mission aircraft assigned to their
        installation will also detail the LWU roles and responsibilities for IFM missions in their
        local Weather Support Document (WSD) or equivalent document. (T-1)
5. Commander Responsibilities.
     5.1. Wing commanders are responsible for ensuring the weather support requirements of the
     wing, tenant and transient units are met using the “provide or arrange for” concept in
     AFMAN 15-129V2.
     5.2. Commanders of PACAF units deploying within or outside the PACAF AOR (or theater)
     will ensure weather support requirements for their unit at its deployed location (to include
     exercises) are met. Depending on the mission and deployment location, commanders will
     consider taking weather personnel for support. If assigned weather personnel do not deploy,
     then the deployed unit’s home weather unit will ensure the deployed forces receive weather
     support to accomplish their mission through a reachback capability to the home weather unit,
     coordination with a weather unit at the deployed location, or the deployed location’s
     supporting OWS. (T-1)
     5.3. Agencies requiring weather information will coordinate through their regularly
     supporting weather unit and clearly state their support requirements. Agencies will state the
     mission requiring support, type of information needed, frequency of delivery, update
     frequency and meteorological criteria, format, media, and preferred delivery method. (T-2)
     5.4. PACAF operational and tactical weather units will develop and administer weather
     indoctrination training for air traffic control personnel IAW AFI 13-204V3 and AFMAN 15-
     111. This training should focus on the cooperative weather watch principle and provide a
     general overview of the types of weather, climatological summary of Visual Flight
     Rule/Instrument Flight Rule (VFR/IFR) conditions, types and location of weather equipment,
     basic and cooperative weather watch procedures, tower visibility, prevailing visibility and
     any observing limitations. (T-1)
6. JTWC Area of Responsibility.
     6.1. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), Pearl Harbor, HI, the Central Pacific
     Hurricane Center (CPHC), Honolulu, HI, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Miami,
PACAFI15-101 23 APRIL 2014                                                                   7


   FL, issue tropical cyclone warnings and advisories. JTWC’s area of responsibility (AOR) is
   from the East Coast of Africa to the West Coast of the Americas. CPHC issues civil tropical
   cyclone forecasts/advisories north of the equator between 180° and 140° W. NHC issues
   civil tropical cyclone forecasts/advisories north of the equator between 140° W and the West
   Coast of the Americas. In the CPHC and NHC AOR, JTWC will repackage the National
   Weather Service forecasts as warnings for DOD installation application/utilization. (T-0)
7. Pacific Tropical Cyclone Reconnaissance Network (TCRN).
   7.1. 17 OWS, through JTWC, retains tropical cyclone reconnaissance responsibility in
   PACAF. JTWC will produce tropical cyclone position and intensity estimates to execute the
   PACAF executive agency responsibility for tropical cyclone reconnaissance and forecast
   operations as defined in USPACOMINST 0539.1. These position and intensity estimates
   will be recorded on PACAF Form 413, Tropical Cyclone Satellite Position/Intensity Log
   (Attachment 2), or equivalent locally produced product or form. (T-2)
   7.2. The primary component of the TCRN is the MARK IVB (AN/UMQ-13 (V)) network.
   The Satellite Operations (SATOPS) Flight of JTWC uses the MARK IVB client-server
   capability to access MARK IVB data to perform tropical cyclone reconnaissance.
   7.3. Due to the criticality of these systems to the TCRN, the weather flights at Kadena AB,
   Andersen AFB, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, and the 17 OWS at Joint Base Pearl
   Harbor-Hickam will appoint a MARK IVB METSAT Coordinator whose responsibility will
   be to ensure the local MARK IVB components and communications are operating properly
   and required maintenance is coordinated and performed. (T-2). MARK IVB maintenance
   technicians assigned to Communications Squadrons at Kadena AB, Andersen AFB, Joint
   Base Elmendorf-Richardson and Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam maintain the MARK IVBs.
   Successful exploitation of the TCRN MARK IVB sites requires close coordination between
   JTWC, MARK IVB METSAT Coordinators, and MARK IVB maintenance technicians.
8. TCRN Operation and Management
   8.1. The JTWC Satellite Operations will:
      8.1.1. Conduct 24-hour meteorological watch on all tropical and subtropical disturbances
      within the JTWC AOR. (T-2)
      8.1.2. Report positions and intensity estimates on significant tropical cyclones in these
      regions using the format provided in Attachment 4. (T-2)
      8.1.3. Establish written procedures for conducting quality assessment (QA) of locally
      produced tropical cyclone position and intensity reports. (T-2)
      8.1.4. Conduct on-the-spot QA of any tropical cyclone position and intensity reports to
      include those locally produced and those received from sources outside the JTWC. (T-2)
      8.1.5. Conduct after-the-fact product QA of locally produced tropical cyclone position
      and intensity reports. (T-2)
      8.1.6. Provide positions and intensities every 3 hours or more frequently as requested by
      the Typhoon Duty Officer (TDO). (T-2)
   8.2. JTWC SATOPS Flight Commander will:
 8                                                             PACAFI15-101 23 APRIL 2014


        8.2.1. Manage daily operations for tropical cyclone reconnaissance support within
        PACAF. (T-2)
        8.2.2. Communicate with Fielded Systems Support Center (FSSC) on Mark IVB
        maintenance and operations issues affecting PACAF. (T-2)
        8.2.3. Coordinate with FSSC on any additional operational satellite taskings and
        products. Users from other MAJCOMs should staff their request through FSSC who will,
        in turn, coordinate with JTWC, through the SATOPS Flight. If requests from other
        MAJCOMs are received by the SATOPS OIC from FSSC, the SATOPS Flight
        Commander will attempt to support these requests for missions after considering and
        balancing the assets available for tropical cyclone reconnaissance. (T-2)
        8.2.4. Provide an end-of-year storm summary of tropical cyclone position and intensity
        estimate accuracy relative to the JTWC final “best-tracks.” This summary is contained
        within the Annual Tropical Cyclone Report (ATCR) and briefed at the Tropical Cyclone
        Conference.     A history of ATCRs can be found at the following website:
        https://nepoc.oceanography.navy.mil/portal/web/jtwc/tropical-cyclone
        8.2.5. Inform the Director, JTWC of changes in the overall status of the TCRN. (T-2)
     8.3. TCRN Backup Procedures.
        8.3.1. In the event that JTWC cannot maintain responsibility as TCRN, position and
        intensity estimates of tropical and subtropical cyclones are available via the Global
        Telecommunications System (GTS) from the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and
        Information Service (NESDIS) Satellite Analysis branch and foreign agencies assigned as
        Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMC) or Tropical Cyclone Warning
        Centers (TCWC). JTWC will rely on these alternate sources of data until they can
        resume normal operations. (T-2)
9. TCRN MARK IVB Geostationary and Polar Orbiting Satellite Assignment
     9.1. Each TCRN MARK IVB has assigned geostationary satellites (Table 1). Kadena and
     Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam have two geo antennas, so they are assigned two primary
     satellites. This redundancy ensures JTWC has access to near real-time geostationary satellite
     data across the entire AOR. The MARK IVB METSAT Coordinator at each site (Kadena
     AB, Andersen AFB, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, and Joint Base Pearl Harbor-
     Hickam) will dedicate their local geostationary antenna(e) to their assigned geostationary
     satellite(s), unless directed to change by JTWC. JTWC will coordinate with FSSC to ensure
     critical operational mission support continuity before satellite changes are made. (T-2)
PACAFI15-101 23 APRIL 2014                                                                    9

  Note: These sites are listed as informational only to reinforce the
  program’s global nature. PACAF has no control or direction over these
  sites. However, JTWC can access imagery over the Indian Ocean from
  these sites.

   9.2. MARK IVB maintenance technicians at each site (Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam,
   Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Andersen AFB, and Kadena AB) are responsible for
   maintaining and moving the MARK IVB antenna only when requested to do so by the local
   MARK IVB METSAT Coordinator. Any maintenance requiring movement of the
   geostationary antenna or a change in geostationary assignment for the antenna will be
   coordinated by the local MARK IVB Coordinator with FSSC and JTWC. (T-2)
   9.3. Alternate Solutions to Mission Conflict.
      9.3.1. The MARK IVB geostationary antennae may be programmed to alternate between
      the assigned primary and alternate satellites. Careful consideration must be given to the
      additional wear-and-tear on equipment caused by constant switching between
      geostationary satellites which can cause significant shortening of the antenna’s life. The
      local MARK IVB METSAT Coordinator will coordinate this process with FSSC and
      JTWC prior to programming. FSSC may involve the Mark IVB contractor. (T-2)
      9.3.2. Polar orbiting satellite priorities are as follows: all Defense Meteorological
      Satellite Program (DMSP) then Suomi/NPOESS Preparatory Project (S/NPP), National
      Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Meteorological Operational satellite
      programmer (METOP) and Feng Yung (FY) polar passes between 1 hour before and 30
      minutes after the tropical cyclone warning time (in the warning window). Units will
 10                                                            PACAFI15-101 23 APRIL 2014


      follow the direction of FSSC or JTWC to temporarily modify this priority for special
      circumstances. (T-2)
   9.4. TCRN MARK IVB Scheduled Outages.
      9.4.1. The local MARK IVB METSAT Coordinator at each TCRN MARK IVB site will:
          9.4.1.1. Establish procedures with the local Base Network Control Center to ensure
          immediate notification of scheduled base network outages expected to impact
          external or internal access to their local MARK IVB server. (T-2)
          9.4.1.2. Establish procedures with the local MARK IVB maintenance technicians to
          ensure JTWC is immediately notified of scheduled maintenance expected to impact
          external or internal access to their local MARK IVB server or the reception and
          processing of satellite data. (T-2)
          9.4.1.3. Immediately notify FSSC of any scheduled network service outage or
          scheduled maintenance affecting access to their local MARK IVB. (T-1)
      9.4.2. JTWC will:
          9.4.2.1. Weigh the impact of scheduled outages and make every possible effort to
          accommodate the requirements of each MARK IVB site. (T-2)
          9.4.2.2. Coordinate between FSSC and the local MARK IVB METSAT Coordinator
          to determine an estimated system down time and relate the impact of the outage for
          the purpose of aiding the Administrator in bringing the MARK IVB back into service.
          (T-2)
      9.4.3. The local MARK IVB maintenance technicians will notify the local MARK IVB
      METSAT Coordinator and FSSC of any scheduled maintenance impacting internal or
      external access to the local server, or the reception and processing of satellite data. (T-2)
   9.5. Unscheduled TCRN Service Outages.
      9.5.1. The MARK IVB METSAT Coordinator will report local MARK IVB outages to
      FSSC. FSSC’s current procedure is to open an internal trouble ticket and then notify the
      appropriate base Job Control Center and JTWC. The base Job Control Center will contact
      the local MARK IVB maintenance technician for repair of the system and provide
      updates to the local MARK IVB METSAT Coordinator upon request. (T-1)
      9.5.2. Each team of MARK IVB technicians is responsible for maintaining their systems
      to include: repair actions, system administration, coordination on connectivity issues,
      and coordination with other work centers when necessary. (T-2)
      9.5.3. MARK IVB maintenance technicians will perform preventative maintenance in
      accordance with the Mark IVB Technical Orders and notify the local MARK IVB
      METSAT Coordinator and FSSC of changes in system status, equipment status, and/or
      client access. (T-2)
10. Radar Support and Data Collection
   10.1. Radar Reconnaissance. This section describes the role of USAF units in the Pacific
   Radar Tropical Cyclone Reporting System. The purpose of the reporting system is to ensure
   that timely, high quality radar observations are made available to the JTWC. The storm fix is
PACAFI15-101 23 APRIL 2014                                                                    11


   used to accurately initialize storm location, thus ensuring the most accurate forecast track.
   Refer to the NHOP (National Hurricane Operations Plan) WSR-88D Tropical Cyclone
   Operations Plan & Checklist to obtain the specific radar settings for your WSR-88D:
   http://www.ofcm.gov/homepage/text/pubs.htm.
   10.2. The 17 OWS will provide tropical cyclone position reports using the format prescribed
   in Attachment 3 whenever a tropical cyclone in the western North Pacific is first detectable
   by a USAF owned WSR-88D radar. These and subsequent reports will be provided
   regardless of warning or condition of readiness status. Updates will be provided hourly
   thereafter on the top of the hour (following duty priorities) until the storm is no longer
   detected by the radar or drops below tropical depression strength. JTWC may request more
   frequent radar fixes due to unusual circumstances and the 17 OWS will accommodate as
   much as practical following duty priorities. The 17 OWS will ensure an appropriate number
   of personnel are knowledgeable of, and comply with, standard procedures for reporting
   tropical cyclones. (T-2)
      10.2.1. Maintain the capability to archive, within OPUP (Open-System Principal User
      Processor) system limits or Gibson Ridge software limits, the radar products listed in para
      10.2.1.1. through 10.2.1.4. as requested by JTWC:
          10.2.1.1. Base Reflectivity; .5 degree, 124nm range, .54 nm resolution.
          10.2.1.2. Base Reflectivity; 1.5 degree, 124 nm range, .54 nm resolution.
          10.2.1.3. Base Velocity; .5 degree, 124nm range, .54 nm resolution.
          10.2.1.4. Base Velocity; 1.5 degree, 124 nm range, .54 nm resolution.
      10.2.2. Local weather units (Table 3) with an OPUP/Gibson Ridge archive ability will
      maintain a backup capability to archive products listed in para 10.2.1.1. through 10.2.1.4.
      as requested by the 17 OWS if the 17 OWS is unable to archive for their location. (T-2)

11. Tropical Cyclone (TC) Reporting.
   11.1. When a TC of tropical storm strength or greater passes within 150nm of a USAF
   military weather reporting organization in USPACOM, that organization will prepare a
   message and send it to JTWC within 24 hours of passage. (T-2) The message will include
   the following:
      11.1.1. Name of tropical cyclone.
      11.1.2. Date and time of occurrence.
      11.1.3. Closest point of approach (azimuth and range of storm center). WF/OLs may
      need to obtain this information from their respective OWS.
      11.1.4. Maximum sustained wind.
      11.1.5. Peak gust.
      11.1.6. Minimum sea level pressure.
   11.2. Following passage of a TC, organizations will coordinate with JTWC to determine if
   any of the following needs to be sent to JTWC to close any data gaps (T-2) :
      11.2.1. Photographs of storm action or damage. Consider OPSEC while taking photos.
      Recommend asking your local Public Affairs or equivalent office review photos before
      sending to JTWC. Follow Operational Risk Management steps before roaming around
      the base to take photos of damage. There are typically numerous hazards which need to
      be removed or mitigated before your installation leadership will allow personnel to travel
      around the installation.
      11.2.2. Radar photographs or captured images. If installation is covered by a WSR-88D,
      local weather organizations must coordinate with 17 OWS, prior to storm arrival, to
      ensure an adequate archive is maintained for post-storm assessment.
      11.2.3. Clippings from local newspapers concerning the storm.
      11.2.4. In case of significant damage, a narrative of the storm’s passage.
12. Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment Product (TC-TAP).
   12.1. 17 OWS issues TC-TAP IAW AFMAN 15-129V1. Exploitation units utilize TC-TAP
   IAW AFMAN 15-129V2. The following are PACAF-unique additions to TC-TAP.
      12.1.1. 17 OWS will issue updated TC-TAPs within 90 minutes of receipt of an updated
      JTWC TC bulletin. (T-2)
      12.1.2. Additional operationally significant crosswind threshold of 15 kt.
      12.1.3. TC-TAP will include expected precipitation accumulation for each location. (T-
      2)
      12.1.4. 17 OWS uses HURRTRAK as the enterprise directed standard software for
      producing TC-TAPs.
13. Significant Event Reporting.
   13.1. PACAF weather organizations will notify PACAF/A3TX as soon as possible,
   regardless of day/time, upon learning of the following:
PACAFI15-101 23 APRIL 2014                                                                     13


      13.1.1. Significant operational incident related to weather conditions or weather services
      within their areas of responsibility. A significant operational incident is one that is
      formally reported by a base/post/installation through their respective command channels
      via operational reports (such as OPREPs and BEELINEs), or one that is reported through
      command or weather functional channels via other means which is likely to receive
      senior officer attention because it contains critical comments regarding weather services
      (for example, an email to a MAJCOM weather functional or the Air Staff).
      13.1.2. Significant adverse incident involving weather personnel likely to gain publicity
      or visibility with civil or military law enforcement officials and likely to gain host-base
      wing commander or higher attention. For example, a base “blotter” entry represents a
      significant adverse personnel incident and should be reported, while a speeding ticket on
      or off base would not represent an incident applicable under this instruction. Weather
      organizations notify PACAF/A3TX concurrent with or after any reporting through local
      chain of command.
   13.2. AFMAN 15-129V2 requires active duty base/post weather flights to coordinate with
   OWSs when the weather flight learns of an operational incident. This coordination ensures a
   thorough and accurate account of weather conditions and weather services is provided to the
   host/parent unit submitting the report. This instruction directs the OWS to take the additional
   step of notifying PACAF/A3TX as soon as possible upon learning of an operational incident.
   OWSs are not expected to seek out or “shop for” potential incidents (OPREPs, etc.) solely
   based on the potential of an incident due to adverse weather conditions.
   13.3. OWS weather forecasters and shift supervisors will remain vigilant for operational
   incidents at non-collocated Total Force units and provide that information to the Senior Duty
   Officer/NCO. The Senior Duty Officer/NCO will ensure the OWS initiates contact with the
   command post of the affected unit to coordinate weather information and notify HQ
   PACAF/A3TX of the potential operational report.
14. Weather Technical Performance Evaluation. Until AF/A3O-W publishes an updated AFI
15-114 and PACAF/A3TX has had an opportunity to write its supplement, the following
constitutes PACAF Weather Technical Performance Evaluation.
   14.1. Verification metrics for Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) coded products are
   automated and available from the 17 OWS Local Intranet site. Contact 17 OWS to obtain
   permission to access this site. Verification metrics (WARNVER) for resource protection
   products (watches, warnings, advisories) are also automated and available through the
   IWWCs          application on the Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) Portal
   (https://17owsjet.hickam.af.mil/jetspeed/portal/).     All echelons within AFW with
   permissions can access these sites to download those TAFVER and WARNVER metrics
   needed at their levels. There is no need for upward reporting of TAFVER and WARNVER
   metrics through PACAF/A3TX to AF/A3O-W. 17 OWS will courtesy copy PACAF/A3TX
   on any TAFVER or WARNVER metrics summaries/feedback provided to EUs. (T-2)
   14.2. All weather organizations (WFs, WSTs, WSs, OWSs) which issue Mission Weather
   Products (MWP) or Mission Execution Forecasts (MEF) will maintain an Operational
   Verification (OPVER) program IAW AFI 15-114. As a minimum, the OPVER program will
   meet these requirements (T-2):
14                                                          PACAFI15-101 23 APRIL 2014


     14.2.1. For each mission segment (launch, recovery, drop zone, target engagements,
     etc.), and for each airframe/squadron supported, keep count of number of missions
     briefed GO (forecast weather conditions favorable based on mission critical thresholds).
     Then determine how many of these GO forecasts were accurate (actual weather favorable
     based on mission critical thresholds, an observed GO), and how many were not accurate
     (actual weather unfavorable based on mission critical thresholds, an observed NO GO).
     Similarly, keep count of number of missions briefed NO GO (forecast conditions
     unfavorable based on mission critical thresholds). Determine how many NO GO forecasts
     were accurate (actual weather was unfavorable based on mission critical thresholds, an
     observed NO GO), and how many were not accurate (actual weather favorable based on
     mission critical thresholds, an observed GO).
     14.2.2. A mission may consist of multiple aircraft if they receive a single MEF and are
     debriefed as a single mission. For multi-unit missions, the Lead Weather Unit will
     conduct OPVER on the Controlling Mission Execution Forecast (CMEF).
     14.2.3. When determining if the observed weather was GO or NO GO, weather
     organizations will use information in the following priority: crew feedback, objective
     verification, subjective verification. Objective and subjective verification methods will
     be consistently applied. (T-2)
     14.2.4. Weather organizations will coordinate with supported warfighters to determine
     metrics to be computed and tracked, and to determine the impact of MEFs on mission
     success. FYI 67, Mission Execution Forecast Verification (MEFVER) Guide, December
     2005, is an excellent primer on how to compute the various metrics that can be derived
     from the data collected under paragraph 14.2.1 above. Weather organizations will
     periodically inform their supported warfighters on the results of the OPVER program
     with emphasis on (T-2):
        14.2.4.1. Advising supported warfighters on the status of weather products/services
        provided.
        14.2.4.2. Identifying limitations to parent/host operations that could be mitigated
        based on application of environmental information.
        14.2.4.3. Identifying opportunities for improvement.
     14.2.5. Weather organizations are encouraged to evaluate the impact of other Mission
     Weather Products on the one or two most important supported warfighter decision points.
     This too will require coordination with supported warfighters to determine which
     decision points are the most important, and to collect the necessary feedback to evaluate
     the impact of the MWPs on mission success. PACAF/A3TX will provide guidance and
     assistance in this area upon request.
     14.2.6. Weather organizations will forward to PACAF/A3TX by the 15 th of the month
     the previous month’s total data counts for data collected under paragraphs 14.2.1 and
     14.2.5 above. Army support weather squadrons may compile OPVER data from their
     detachments/OLs and send consolidated totals. PACAF/A3TX will compile metrics from
     this data to monitor, analyze, and evaluate the effectiveness of weather support within
     PACAF. (T-2)
PACAFI15-101 23 APRIL 2014                                                                   15


   14.3. 17 OWS will maintain a program to evaluate the accuracy of its regional graphics
   products, and periodically inform the weather organizations in the AOR, to include
   PACAF/A3TX, of program results. (T-2)
15. Weather Equipment Outage Reporting.
   15.1. PACAF weather organizations report weather equipment and communications outages
   IAW AFI 21-103. Also notify FSSC for outages of AFW fielded systems IAW AFMAN 15-
   129V2.       Maintain an outage log using PACAF Form 416, Weather
   Equipment/Communications Service Record or a locally devised outage log that contains the
   same information. (T-2)
      15.1.1. Use a separate form or sheet for each piece of weather equipment.
      15.1.2. Compute outage times by subtracting the time between initial report and time
      returned to duty. Adjust times to reflect only the hours the organization is open.
      15.1.3. Use the remarks section of the outage form to briefly describe the reason or cause
      of the outage. Follow-up actions must also be noted to provide documentation if
      historical data or contractor response information is needed to resolve unique problems.
      At a minimum, daily updates should be logged and briefed during all shift changes and
      Meteorological Conferences (METCON).
      15.1.4. For fixed weather sensing equipment outages at EUs that have airfield surface
      observing responsibility, log the time out and time in also on the AF Form 3803/AF Form
      3813, Surface Weather Observations, Column 90.
   15.2. PACAF weather organizations report all long-term or expected long-term Red Outages
   (see AFI 21-103, paragraph 6.2) of more than 72 hours to HQ PACAF/A3TX at
   pacaf.a3txweather.1@us.af.mil, or DSN (315) 448-1490. Additionally, organizations
   should report any other outages that merit higher headquarters involvement or awareness.
   (T-2)
      15.2.1. Provide sufficient information about the outage so that PACAF staff can
      adequately assist in outage resolution as required. This information should include the
      following: the POC’s name, rank, e-mail address, organization, equipment or circuit
      description, date/time of outage, parts required/ordered, parts ordered Mission Capability
      (MICAP) (Y/N), Estimated Time in Commission (ETIC) and any other pertinent
      information.
      15.2.2. Provide follow-up reports when there is a change in operational status, new
      information about the outage, or as requested by PACAF/A3TX. The final report should
      be sent when the outage has been successfully corrected and the corrective action taken.
   15.3. PACAF weather organizations document maintenance support procedures in a local
   weather support document or letter of agreement, as appropriate. When developing the
   support concept and procedures, ensure the following are included: a POC for logging
   circuits and equipment in/out, acceptable maintenance response times, specific mission

  impact statements for each piece of equipment the organization uses, and equipment repair
  priorities. Equipment and communications used to directly support flight operations should
  be given the highest repair priority and the shortest response time followed by OPLAN
  tasked tactical equipment followed by all other weather equipment. (T-2)

DVORAK CODE   Intensity estimation code. T#/CI/Trend/Period. T# is the Final
              intensity number. CI = Current Intensity. Trend/Period is amount
              of Final T# change over a specified period (18-30 h). Example:
              T3.0/3.0/D1.0/24HRS.
STT           Short Term Trend. Used if systems change is < 18h.
              Also used to supplement the Trend encoded within the Dvorak
              Code. An example is when the Dvorak Code trend indicates no
              intensity change from 24 hours ago but the storm actually
              weakened (indicating the system has possibly peaked) within the
              last 12 hours.

              (Low Level Circulation Center), ULCC (Upper Level
              Circulation Center), or CSC (Cloud System Center).
FIX CODE      Enter the appropriate fix code.
REMARKS       Enter PBO (position based on) followed by the primary method
              used to position the circulation center, EYE, SBC, CDO,
              ANMTN, etc. Include qualifying parameters when applicable
              (eye diameter/definition, outflow patterns, etc.) If an intensity
              estimation was done, enter DBO (Dvorak based on) DT, PT or
              MET.
SITE FIXES    Check the column corresponding to the appropriate site. Use the
              blank column for other sites not listed.
INITIALS      Initials of the satellite analyst.

min, 3,4,5,6, = 1,2,3,6 hours; dd = direction of movement from in tens of degrees; ff = speed of
movement (knots); e.g., 32812 (reads as the past 1-hour movement from 280 at 12 knots). If past
movement is not available, enter N/A.
J. VELOCITY COUPLET. Velocity couplet defines the circulation center. If YES, use a velocity
cross section to determine inbound and outbound low-level radial velocity
maxima noting their speed and latitude (thousands of feet); e.g., YES/INBND 70/5, OUTBND
65/7 (reads as inbound radial velocity maximum is 70 knots at 5000 feet, and outbound is 65
knots at 7000 feet). If a couplet is not present, enter NO, or if no WSR-88D is available, enter
N/A.
