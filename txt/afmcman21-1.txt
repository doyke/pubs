  TECHNICAL ORDER (TO) MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION TOOLS; AFMC
    CENTRALIZED TO MANAGEMENT (CTOM) COMMITTEE; SPECIAL TO
                     PROCEDURES; BUDGETING

1.1. General: This manual provides AFMC procedures relating to the Air Force Technical
Order (TO) System. See Attachment 1, for Referenced and Related Publications and
Referenced Forms.
1.2. TO Management and Production Tools. All TO System data input, management
practices, and TO acquisition, sustainment and use procedures will be performed using the Joint
Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (JCALS) system, AF-sanctioned interfacing
program tools, or the Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS) currently
under development. Exceptions are listed in AFMCI 21-301, and 00-5-series TOs.
   1.2.1. Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS). ETIMS is the
   next-generation information management tool used to manage the TO System. It is being
   developed in ―spirals.‖ Spiral 1 will soon be ―turned on‖ sequentially by base/region (to
   allow for site set-up and workflow development), with the TO user functionalities of
   review TO Catalog, order TOs and submit Recommended Changes. Additional TO
   management functionality will be added in subsequent spirals.
       1.2.1.1. ETIMS will be highly automated, with most functions supported by in-depth
       on-line training and help modules. For support, users will call the standard Global
       Combat Support System (GCSS) Facilities Assistance Branch (FAB) Help Desk line,
       DSN 596-5771, Comm (334) 416-5771, or toll free (877) 596-5771. There will be a
       voice menu with ETIMS as one of the options. There will also be a unique e-mail
       address for reporting problems.
       1.2.1.2. When ETIMS functions become available, they must be used, unless a waiver is
       granted by HQ USAF/ILMM. Because of the spiral development concept, ETIMS
       will overlap with JCALS (see below) until all JCALS functions are subsumed. At that
       time, ETIMS will become the sole Air Force system of record.
   1.2.2. Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (JCALS) System. The
   JC ALS system is a joint service, distributed technical management information system. The
   JCALS system automates the wholesale (supplier) Air Force TO system functions of
   manage, acquire, improve, publish, stock and distribute; and the retail (customer) functions
   of viewing TO Index data (metadata), ordering TOs, managing accounts and submitting TO
   improvement reports. The JCALS system connects TO users and managers in the operational
   environment.
       1.2.2.1. JCALS Roles and Privileges. JCALS users are assigned ―roles‖ that include a
       set of system privileges using a specific role name to provide capability to perform
       various functions. TO management functions require that a user profile contain at least
       the JCALS system default roles of Technical Manual (TM) Manager, Equipment
       Specialist, and Distribution Manager. These roles are normally shared by several
       people. Other commonly required roles include Writer/Editor, Quality Assurance
6                                                        AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


       (QA) Manager, Ad Hoc Browser User, and TM Account Point of Contact. Unique
       JCALS system roles may also be established for a specific purpose locally. AF standard
       roles have been established for the retail functions. Unlike JCALS default roles, these
       roles must be established and administered at every JCALS site. See
       https://techdata.wpafb.af.mil/jcals/jcals_main_screen.htm.
       1.2.2.2. JCALS Desktop Instructions (DI). Procedures for on-line use of JCALS
       functions are documented in the JCALS DI. This publication may be accessed from the
       Army JCALS web site (https://www.jcals.army.mil/index.cfm). Formal DI updates
       will be published when procedures change due to software upgrades, with interim
       updates (―DI Bulletins‖) published as required. All on-line JCALS users must ensure
       they are using a current copy of the DI and have applicable DI Bulletins. HQ
       AFMC/LGYE will notify JCALS site POCs when new DI revisions or DI Bulletins are
       available. Site POCs must notify local JCALS users.
    1.2.3. Automated TO Management System (ATOMS). ATOMS is a PC-based relational
    database application designed to assist with maintaining TO Distribution Office (TODO) TO
    requirements and distribution records. TODOs without on-line JCALS or ETIMS access
    must use ATOMS to prepare and submit TO Publication Requests (TOPR) via Internet
    File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Service to OC-ALC (TO 00-5-1, AF Technical Order System).
    1.2.4. Automated Technical Order System (ATOS). ATOS is a loose-leaf publication
    and document management system for developing, maintaining and sustaining Air Force
    TOs, operating at the three Air Logistics Centers. ATOS receives, stores, and maintains
    digital TOs and TO change page data and is capable of producing PDF output to meet
    Print On Demand (POD) requirements in a paperless environment. ATOS consists of
    seven subsystems; production control, text capture, text generation, graphics capture,
    graphics generation, review and output. ATOS has the capability to convert technical data
    from a paper source to Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and accept
    SGML deliveries from outside sources. The SGML output data is Tech Manual
    Specification & Standard (TMSS) compliant.
    1.2.5. TO Management And Retrieval Tool (TO.MART). TO.MART is a digital TO
    indexing and retrieval software application developed by the Air Force.
    The     TO.MART        application     software    files   may    be     downloaded      from
    http://www.ide.wpafb.af.mil/field/ToolsMenu.htm. TODOs may use this tool to identify,
    locate and access the most current versions of digital TO files. When TO.MART is hosted
    on a LAN server, other TO users serviced by the TODO may also use the program to locate
    and access TOs. TODOs register TOs and files in TO.MART, and the program then tracks
    the locations and versions across many CDs, network drives, local drives, floppies, and/or
    other media. TO.MART will present the user with a list of TOs in order by TO number, title,
    publication date or other characteristic, any of which are searchable. Individual users would
    open the TO.MART Index file and click on the desired TO number, which opens the file
    using the appropriate viewing software (Acrobat, MS Word, etc.). If the drive or medium
    containing the TO is not available (for example, if the CD containing the selected TO is not
    in the drive), TO.MART will prompt the user to insert the appropriate volume and then
    display the TO. User-defined groups allow TOs to be separated into categories and
    subcategories for more convenient browsing. Additional information about this application
    is available from the User Manual provided with the software.
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                 7


   1.2.6. Other Tools. There are specialized management systems used for various sub-
   categories of TOs, for example: (a) the Security Assistance TO Data System (SATODS)
   used to manage Foreign Military Sales (FMS) TO programs; (b) the Next Generation
   Automated Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Publication System (AEODPS-NG) used
   to publish and manage EOD TOs; (c) the Comprehensive Integrated TO Management
   System (CITOMS) used in conjunction with JCALS to acquire and manage TOs at OO-
   ALC and AAC/NWLT; and (d) the Digital Legacy Data Storage System (DLDSS) used for
   digital TO storage. At WR-ALC, the TO warehouse functions have been automated by the
   Prime TO Warehouse System (PTOWS), with digital copies of the entire inventory of
   assigned TOs hosted on the Central TO Repository (CTOR) System. OO-ALC is also
   storing some TOs on the CTOR System. The Reliability & Maintainability Information
   System (REMIS) is used to track Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) compliance
   and equipment configuration. Some of these tools will eventually be subsumed by ETIMS,
   while others will be eliminated altogether. For those systems to be subsumed or
   eliminated, only critical changes and routine maintenance are allowed–other updates
   must be approved by waiver submitted through HQ AFMC/LGYE to HQ USAF/ILMM.
1.3. AFMC Centralized Technical Order Management (CTOM) Committee Charter:
   1.3.1. Purpose. The AFMC CTOM Committee provides a forum for experienced TO
   managers to review, understand and discuss TO management issues with headquarters
   staffers. The AFMC committee develops command policies and procedures to implement
   U.S. Air Force (USAF) TO System and Department of Defense (DoD) policy, and submits
   them for formal approval as official AFMC guidance. The AFMC committee works to
   resolve command issues and recommend positions on issues raised by or needing input to
   the AF CTOM Committee.
   1.3.2. Chair. HQ AFMC/LGYE chairs the AFMC CTOM Committee and is one of the
   AF CTOM Committee members (AF CTOM guidance in AFI 21-303 governs AFMC
   participation). LGYE coordinates command issues with other HQ AFMC offices.
   1.3.3. Center Coordination. Members obtain coordination from Program Manager (PM)
   functional OPRs affected by TO policy, practices and procedures in order to develop center
   positions on issues.
   1.3.4. Membership. AFMC CTOM Committee membership is listed on the Internet at
   https://www.hqafmc.wpafb.af.mil/en/toctom/. ―Advisors‖ are mandatory coordination
   offices for AF TO System policy and AFMC policy implementation affecting their activity.
   Advisors are invited to all meetings, but attendance is not essential. PMs are considered
   advisors for matters affecting the TOs they control.
   1.3.5. Meetings. Meetings are held at the call of the chair, and will normally precede
   Air Force CTOM and AFMC TO Advisory Council (TOAC) meetings to allow developing
   an AFMC position on issues to be discussed. To minimize travel costs, meetings will use
   VTCs, e-mail, and meet-me telephone calls to the maximum extent possible. HQ
   AFMC/LGYE will post CTOM information on the CTOM Committee web site
   (https://www.hqafmc.wpafb.af.mil/en/toctom/).

1.4. Wholesale Level TO System Roles.
    1.4.1. Program Manager (PM). A PM is the System Program Director (SPD) or
    Product Group Manager (PGM) for a system or product line, and serves as the single-face-
    to-the-user for the system or products. PMs are responsible to their customers for all aspects
    of the planning, development, sustainment, and evolution of the products they acquire and
    support. PMs are responsible for program performance and overall health of the product.
       1.4.1.1. The responsible PM or Supply Chain Manager (SCM – see below) will appoint
       personnel to manage TOs according to AFI 21-303, 00-5-series TOs and this manual.
       Authorized personnel will be shown in the JCALS/ETIMS Index Record for each TO.
       1.4.1.2. PMs managing aircraft programs will appoint Flight Manual Managers (FMM)
       to perform similar functions for flight manual TOs, IAW AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals
       Program.
    1.4.2. Supply Chain Manager (SCM). Designated individual(s) at an Air Logistics Center
    responsible for managing a line of National Stock Number (NSN)-coded items. SCM
    functions include requirements determination; cataloging, standardization and
    engineering data management; stock control and distribution; technical management
    functions; and pricing for their assigned items. SCMs report to ALC Commanders, but are
    responsible for supplying, repairing, and managing materiel (including TOs) to support
    PMs. SCM functions are combined with PM functions in this manual.
    1.4.3. Chief Engineer. The Chief Engineer (or his designee) is responsible for approving
    the technical content of all TOs, unless he delegates this authority in writing IAW AFPD
    63-12, Assurance of Operational Safety, Suitability & Effectiveness and AFI 63-1201,
    Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&E). Changes to technical data for end
    items and commodities must be coordinated with the single managers/chief engineers of all
    weapons systems that they will be/are used on prior to issuing any changes, unless the
    authority has been delegated in writing to the PM/SCM owning the TO.
    1.4.4. TO Manager. The TO Manager is responsible for managing some or all of the TOs
    for a specific military system or commodity program. Management responsibilities include
    acquisition, sustainment, format, publishing, storage and distribution of TOs and related
    technical data in accordance with AFPD 21-3, AFI 21-303, and 00-5-series TOs. When
    acquisition is being performed at a product center, and sustainment will be managed at an
    ALC, the PM will ensure TO logistics supportability issues are coordinated with the
    candidate ALC TO Manager to assure compliance with applicable technical data guidance.
    TO Managers will:
       1.4.4.1. Manage/assist with the acquisition and sustainment of TOs to support PM-
       managed systems and end items.
       1.4.4.2. Manage the formatting, publication and distribution of assigned TOs.
       1.4.4.3. Ensure proper Distribution Statements (AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific
       and Technical Information), are applied to the title pages of all assigned TO-numbered
       technical manuals and related data, and both the statement code (A-F or X) and primary
       reason are reflected in the index record for the TOs. Ensure TOs authorized for public
       release have been assigned a case number by the local Public Affairs (PA) office.
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                  9


     1.4.4.4. Deliver copies of preliminary data to verifying units no later than 30-days
     prior to the scheduled verification or in-process review.
     1.4.4.5. In conjunction with the using command, determine the need for a TO
     command review based on the number of modifications made to affected equipment, the
     complexity and extent of modifications and resultant TO changes, and the number of
     recommended changes (RC) from other sources (JCALS, AFTO Information
     Management Tools (IMT) 22, Technical Manual (TM) Change Recommendation
     and Reply or AF IMTs 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication) received
     since the last review.
     1.4.4.6. In conjunction with using MAJCOMs, establish and maintain DMS Address
     Lists (AL) or Personal Distribution Lists (PDL) for Interim TO (ITO) and Rapid Action
     Change (RAC) message distribution in accordance with AFI 33-119, Air Force
     Messaging, AFMCI 21-302, Processing Interim Technical Orders and Rapid Action
     Changes (RAC) and applicable MAJCOM directives. Each Using Command will assist
     the TO Program Manager with identification of the appropriate addressees within that
     command, IAW TO 00-5-1. ALs established solely for distribution of ITOs shall be
     maintained by the TO Manager. OC-ALC/LGLUB (DMS address
     ou:ORGANIZATIONS,1:TINKER AFB OK,ou:OC-ALC(UC), ou:LGLU(UC)), TM
     Account F*10SJ, will be an addressee in each AL or PDL notification.
  1.4.5. Technical Content Manager (TCM). The individual or office responsible for the
  accuracy, adequacy, modification, classification and review of TO procedures, engineering
  data and the related technical contents of a TO. For new acquisitions or major modifications,
  the TCM role is usually performed by an PM-designated logistician or prime contractor,
  assisted by an Integrated Product Team (IPT) of engineers, Equipment Specialists (ES) and
  users. The TCM role for operational equipment is usually performed by the ES responsible
  for the equipment supported by the TO. TCMs are not generally responsible for style and
  format or other non-technical aspects of manuals. TCMs will:
     1.4.5.1. Manage the content of assigned TOs, and apply the most appropriate
     Distribution Statement to control the content‘s dissemination.
     1.4.5.2. Approve release of assigned limited distribution TOs to personnel and
     organizations over and above those authorized by the Distribution Statement.
     1.4.5.3. Evaluate Recommended Changes (RCs) for assigned TOs.
     1.4.5.4. Generate updates to assigned TOs.
     1.4.5.5. Perform currency reviews on unclassified TOs which have not been changed
     for five years, and on classified TOs annually. The JCALS Perform Post-Publication
     Review function provides search capability to identify TOs scheduled for various types
     of review, and also provides a report of review results.
     1.4.5.6. Determine if Service Bulletins, Operations Manual Bulletins, FAA
     Airworthiness Directives, temporary revisions and like data apply to TO-numbered
     flight and maintenance manuals, and whether they will be referred to by their
     commercial numbers or have the data extracted for inclusion in the TO(s).
10                                                        AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


     1.4.6. Flight Manual Manager (FMM). The individual responsible for managing the
     technical content and format of assigned FMP publications. The Flight Manual Manager acts
     as the Technical Content Manager and may also act as the TO Manager for Flight Manual
     TO publications. This includes initial acquisition and verification, maintenance, and periodic
     reviews. See AFI 11-215.
     1.4.7. AFMETCAL Det 1, WR-ALC. AFMETCAL provides an Air Force member to
     the DoD Joint Technical Coordination Group for Calibration and Measurement
     Technology (JTCG-CMT), IAW AFI 21-113, Air Force Metrology And Calibration
     (AFMETCAL) Program. AFMETCAL also provides support to sub-group activities
     according to the Joint Program Operational Plan. AFMETCAL will publish and distribute
     Calibration TOs consistent with the mission and Joint Program Operational Plan. This may
     include use of an AFMETCAL information management system to manage, index, and
     distribute electronic versions of Air Force Calibration Technical Orders.
     1.4.8. JCALS Subject Matter Expert (SME). The JCALS SME is a focal point available
     to assist users with JCALS implementation at a site where JCALS is installed and
     operational. The site JCALS SME will:
        1.4.8.1. Assist site JCALS users to become proficient and productive with JCALS system
        tools to accomplish assigned TO System duties.
        1.4.8.2. Guide and direct personnel to obtain and complete necessary JCALS system
        training.
        1.4.8.3. Assist users with preparation of DD Forms 2875, System Authorization Access
        Request (SAAR). Review and approve DD Forms 2875 requesting JCALS access and
        ensure only required JCALS roles and privileges are requested, consistent with AF
        policy. Forward approved forms to the Systems Administrator (SA).
        1.4.8.4. Assist JCALS SA with evaluation of JCALS system performance, JCALS
        Incident Reports and to establish JCALS user organization structure and assign system
        roles. Assist JCALS SA and JCALS user personnel with installation and set up of
        JCALS system software and necessary system workflow templates to complete assigned
        duties.
        1.4.8.5. Assist new users to build and install JCALS system workflow templates
        needed in the organization to accomplish assigned duties.
     1.4.9. ETIMS Functional Administrator (FA). The ETIMS FA will perform many of
     the same functions for ETIMS as the JCALS SME does for JCALS (see AFI 21-303 and TO
     00-5-1).
1.5. Information Security Requirements.
     1.5.1. General. The following procedures apply to classified and unclassified TOs
     containing data whose distribution must be controlled. TO Managers and TCMs/Flight
     Manual Managers will:
        1.5.1.1. Verify TO data classification using the applicable Security Classification Guide
        (SCG). For contractors, the applicable SCG may be listed in the DD Form 254, Contract
        Security Classification Specification, Department of Defense. Ensure the TO title
        page and each page and paragraph in the TO is marked IAW DOD 5200.1-R, DoD
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                    11


     Information Security Program Regulation, and AFI 31-401, Information Security
     Program Management.
     1.5.1.2. Issue classified technical data in supplemental manuals to the maximum extent
     possible to keep the majority of TOs unclassified (TO 00-5-1). TO titles will be
     unclassified to the maximum extent possible.
     1.5.1.3. Use the applicable SCG as authority to classify TO data needing security
     protection. Review contractor-prepared classified Preliminary TOs (PTOs) to ensure they
     annotate the proper security markings according to DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401.
     Advise the contractor of any required revisions to the PTOs or DD Form 254.
     1.5.1.4. Review classified technical data during every TO update action or at least
     annually for possible classification downgrading according to the applicable SCG or
     DOD 5200.1-R (TO 00-5-1). JCALS does not furnish automatic review notices, but does
     provide the capability for the TO Manager/TCM to set up a periodic scheduled task for a
     Post Pub Review. The task schedule should be set for less than one year to allow time
     to complete the review within the required one-year period.
     1.5.1.5. TO classification changes are disseminated via a TO change or revision and
     listed in the ―Search New, Updated & Inactive TOs‖ function of the TO Catalog.
     1.5.1.6. Issue unclassified updates to Classified TOs whenever possible. When indexing
     unclassified updates to a classified TO, TO Managers must first index the updates in
     JCALS, which will assign the parent TO classification to the update. Then the TO
     Manager must change the classification of the unclassified update only to ―Unclassified,‖
     ensure the JCALS indexing fields "PUB TITLE SECURITY" and "PUB SECURITY"
     indicate ―Unclassified,‖ and verify that both fields match. NOTE: If the Security fields
     do not match, the JCALS index record will default to the parent TO classification, which
     will cause misidentification of an unclassified change as Classified.
  1.5.2. Classification Upgrades. HQ AFMC must concur in the interpretation of the cited
  classification authority for upgrading the classification of an already-distributed TO (if the
  TO was too widely distributed, reclassification may not be possible.) Notify HQ
  AFMC/LGYE and the local Information Security Program Manager (ISPM) (Security
  Forces) of the circumstances requiring an upgrade by classified message. Include the new
  level of security classification, the classification authority, the number of copies issued, the
  length of time the information has existed at a lower classification and if the information is
  available from unclassified sources.
     1.5.2.1. LGYE shall consult with HQ AFMC/MSFXP to determine whether the security
     classification action is Original Classification Authority directed. If so, a classified
     message furnishes authority to begin the upgrade action.
     1.5.2.2. The TCM issues an Emergency Interim Operational Supplement (IOS) or
     RAC IAW AFMCI 21-302 to upgrade the affected TO, and notifies the responsible TO
     Manager to update the TO index entry.
     1.5.2.3. The TO Manager notifies the warehouse responsible for the TO of
     classification upgrades. The warehouse will re-mark existing copies in stock, transfer
     them to a classified storage area, and update the stock location in JCALS.
12                                                        AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


     1.5.3. Classification Downgrade/Declassification. The TO Manager will issue an update
     directing the appropriate downgrade or declassification actions. The warehouse will remark
     all stock of downgraded or declassified TOs before making further distribution. Transfer
     declassified TOs to unclassified TO storage and update the location in JCALS. NOTE:
     Downgrade of a small amount of material that does not change the overall classification of
     the TO should not be the sole justification for issuing a TO update. However, notification of
     the downgrading action and the data involved must be provided to users of the TO.
     1.5.4. Distribution Limitations. Distribution Statements specified in DODD 5230.24,
     Distribution Statements on Technical Documents, shall be used IAW AFI 61-204 to mark all
     TOs and other technical data to specify availability for secondary distribution, release and
     disclosure without additional approval or authorization from the Controlling DoD Office.
     (Primary distribution is made by the Controlling [originating] DoD Office.) A distribution
     statement marking is distinct from and in addition to a security classification marking
     assigned in accordance with DOD 5200.1-R. Air Force personnel who originate or are
     responsible for technical documents must follow guidance contained in AFI 61-204,
     summarized below:
     NOTE: Do not confuse the distribution statements from AFI 61-204 and required on
     TOs, with those described in AFI 33-360V1, Air Force Content Management Program-
     Publications, required on standard, non-technical publications. In particular, ―Functional
     (F) Distribution‖ as used in AFI 33-360V1 does not mean that distribution of the document
     is restricted.
        1.5.4.1. Distribution Statements. Mark interim and formal TOs, TCTOs, PTOs, source
        data, and other technical data (see definitions) with proper distribution statements
        before disseminating them. Apply the single most appropriate distribution statement (A,
        B, C, D, E, F or X). Use both the letter designator and the verbiage from AFI 61-204,
        and fill in the reason, the date of determination, and the controlling DoD office (normally
        the TO Manager office symbol). Other changes to these distribution statements are
        prohibited.
            1.5.4.1.1. If the reason is ―Proprietary Data,‖ add a title page statement of
            government rights to disseminate, use, copy, etc., the data (see TO 00-5-3, AF
            Technical Manual Acquisition Procedures). When creating a technical document
            containing company proprietary data, in addition to distribution statement (B or E)
            (reference AFI 61-204), mark each page that contains proprietary information with
            the word ―proprietary‖ and the name of the company (e.g., ―Boeing Proprietary‖).
            1.5.4.1.2. Publish supplements using the distribution statement applicable to
            supplement contents, not necessarily the parent TO‘s distribution statement. If
            derived documents are generated from the parent technical data, apply the parent
            document distribution control markings to the derived documents, unless the purpose
            was to publish unrestricted data in an unrestricted document.
            1.5.4.1.3. Distribution Statement ―A‖ TOs must be reviewed and assigned a case
            number by the local PA office prior to release. Add the following statement
            immediately below the distribution statement wording: ―PA Case Number
            ________. Submit recommended changes or problems with this Technical Order to
            (TO Manager‘s office symbol).‖
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                13


          1.5.4.1.4. Do not use the ―For Official Use Only (FOUO)‖ code in JCALS TO Index
          records, but select the Limited Distribution statement code assigned to the TO.
     1.5.4.2. Export Control Statement. Mark documents that contain export-controlled
     technical data IAW the Arms Export Control Act or the Export Administration Act of
     1979, as amended with one of the following export control statements. The abbreviated
     statement can only be used on documents without sufficient title page/label space to
     include the full statement, such as CD-ROM labels, reduced size TOs, etc.:
     "WARNING: This document contains technical data whose export is restricted by
     the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.) or the Export
     Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2401, et seq.). Violating these
     export laws subject you to severe criminal penalties. Disseminate in accordance with the
     provisions of DODD 5230.25".
     Or
     "WARNING: Export Controlled".
     1.5.4.3. Disclosure Notice. Apply a disclosure notice to all classified and
     unclassified TOs approved for release to a foreign government, except those assigned
     Distribution Statement A (MIL-STD-38784, Standard Practice for Manuals, Technical:
     General Style and Format Requirements). The disclosure notice will be on all classified
     and unclassified nuclear TOs.
     1.5.4.4. Disposition and Destruction Notices. Assign a Disposition Notice (for public
     release documents) or Handling and Destruction notice (for all other technical
     documents) IAW MIL-STD-38784. See TO 00-5-1 for specific disposition/destruction
     procedures for unclassified paper TOs and digital media.
  1.5.5. Digital TO Security. Security issues and procedures are covered in DOD
  5200.1-R, AFI31-401, AFI 33-129, Web Management and Internet Use, and AFI 61-204
  among others. User access to digital TO files and notification methods must provide
  adequate security for classified and limited-distribution TO files. Classified TO files must
  be encrypted using a National Security Agency (NSA)-approved encryption algorithm,
  while limited-distribution files require a National Institute for Standards and Technology
  (NIST)-approved encryption system prior to being hosted on servers. Except for
  distribution statement ―A‖ documents, TO files must be hosted on a secure (encrypted)
  Internet HTTPS or FTP server with user name and password access control (AFI 33-129).
  NOTE: For security reasons, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) e-mail is not an
  acceptable vehicle for transmitting limited-distribution Interim TOs, RACs or notification
  messages (paragraphs 2.5.3.3 & 2.7.2).
     1.5.5.1. NIST has approved use of ―strong‖ encryption technology (128-bit
     capable/export controlled) provided by the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol for use
     with unclassified, limited distribution technical data. Each organization planning to
     provide access to TO/TO updates via the Internet must establish a secure server with the
     SSL protocol installed. Access to the server must be controlled by the use of user names
     and passwords. In some cases, domain restrictions (.mil, .gov) might be used for DoD
     and/or government agency access, combined with user name and password access for

     authorized contractors. Additional information and assistance should be obtained
     from the local Network Control Center.
     1.5.5.2. Password Protection. There are two levels of password protection available; on
     the server and on individual files. All secure servers must be protected by user
     name/password access controls. Individual TO files may be password protected as well
     if not all persons with access to the server need access to all the files.
        1.5.5.2.1. The SA is responsible for assigning user names and passwords for
        protection of a secure server. When necessary, the user name and password will be
        provided in a secure message to TODOs requiring access to RACs and new baseline
        TO files. The SA is also responsible for periodically changing passwords to help
        prevent unauthorized access and protect the information on the site.
        1.5.5.2.2. The TO Manager or TCM assigns passwords to protect TO and RAC
        files from inadvertent changes. EXAMPLE: To protect an Adobe® Portable
        Document Format™ (PDF) file using Adobe® Acrobat Exchange™ 5.0, use the
        following procedures:
            - Go to ―File‖ and click on ―Document Security‖ or press Control+Alt+S. The
            Security dialog box opens. This box provides options of ―No Security,‖
            ―Acrobat Standard Security‖ and ―Acrobat Self-Sign Security;‖ and provides a
            button to ―Display Settings‖.
            - When ―Acrobat Self-Sign Security‖ is selected, a Self-Sign Security Log-In
            box opens, where you can set up or select an existing User Profile and User
            Password.
            - When ―Acrobat Standard Security‖ is selected, a Standard Security dialog box
            opens. There is ―Specify Password‖ section with entries for ―User Password‖
            and ―Master Password.‖ While the document may be opened using either
            password, the owner password temporarily disables the security settings.
            - In the Standard Security box ―Permissions‖ section, you can select 40-bit or
            128-bit encryption.
            - When 40-bit encryption is selected, you can check security setting boxes to
            specify ―No Printing‖ (not usually used for this application – TODOs may have
            to print the RAC for paper customers), ―No Changing the Document‖ (no
            changes of any kind, including creating form fields, allowed), ―No Content
            Copying or Extraction, Disable Accessibility‖ and ―No Adding or Changing
            Comments and Form Fields‖ (allows filling in form fields, but not adding or
            changing the fields).
            - When 128-bit encryption is selected, different security boxes are available:
            ―Enable Content Access for the Visually Impaired‖ (required to support the
            Accessibility feature) and ―Allow Content Copying and Extraction;‖ and two
            menus, ―Changes Allowed‖ (five choices) and ―Printing‖ (three choices).
            - After selections are made, click ―OK‖ and retype the passwords in the
            confirmation box, then click ―Close‖ in the Document Security dialog box.
            ATTENTION: Passwords are not embedded in the file. If the owner forgets the
            passwords to a document, the file cannot be recovered. Store passwords in a
            separate secure location to prevent loss. NOTE: Instructions on protecting and

             encrypting PDF documents in other Acrobat versions are in the Acrobat Help
             function. Word© files can be protected using the ―Tools,‖ ―Protect Document‖
             function. Other word processing or publishing applications have similar features
             for protecting documents created using the application.
   1.5.6. JCALS ―Proponent (Sponsor) Approval‖ TOs. The TO Manager will use the
   JCALS ―Add a Pub Stock Number‖ screen to set the proponent (sponsor) approval flag to
   ―Yes‖ on all TOs for which initial subscription and distribution requests must be reviewed
   and approved prior to issue. These sponsor approval required TOs include Classified TOs;
   TOs with no distribution statements or distribution statements ―F‖ and ―X;‖ reason codes
   ―Critical Technology,‖ ―Direct Military Support‖ or ―Proprietary;‖ Export Controlled TOs
   (DODD 5230.24 & AFI 61-204); specialized publications (e.g., JNWPS, EOD, etc.); and
   commercial manual TOs with limited reproduction/distribution rights. The TO Manager
   will determine the need to screen other unclassified TOs. Orders for TO quantities in
   excess of the ―Maximum Issue Quantity‖ (MIQ) will also require proponent approval.
1.6. Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health (ESOH) Requirements.
   1.6.1. General. Safety and environmental hazard information and precautions must be
   included in TOs and technical data for operation, maintenance, modification and disposal

1.7. Nuclear Surety Requirements:
   1.7.1. Technical Evaluation. TO procedures involving nuclear weapons, nuclear
   combat or non-combat delivery systems, or support equipment certified and approved for
   use with nuclear weapons (see Master Nuclear Certification List [MNCL],
   https://wwwmil.nwd.kirtland.af.mil/mncl/index.cfm) must receive a technical evaluation
   for nuclear surety (AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program, and AFI 91-103, Air Force
   Nuclear Safety Certification Program). AFI 63-125 requires nuclear certification of TO
   procedures involved in a weapon system's nuclear mission operations, maintenance,
   troubleshooting, OPCERT, DECERT, nuclear compatibility, handling, movement,
   restraint configuration, loading, unloading, delivery, and testing. Nuclear Safety
   Certification is to ensure compliance with nuclear Weapon System Safety Rules (WSSR);
   requirements in 91-100 series AFIs, nuclear safety, and design safety features. The technical
   evaluation for nuclear surety is a continuing process applicable to system or commodity
   operational usage changes, modification procedural changes, and changes to individual
   nuclear WSSRs.
   1.7.2. Documentation and Marking. The TCMs and responsible engineers for nuclear
   weapon TOs will accomplish and document technical evaluations on all change packages
   against assigned TOs. Mark applicable procedures in the TOs with ―HCP‖ or ―NSP‖
   (Hardness Critical Procedure or Nuclear Surety Procedure) as appropriate. Review safety
   rules and record review accomplishment as required by AFI 91-102_AFMCSup1, Nuclear
   Weapon System Safety Studies, Operational Safety Reviews, and Safety Rules. Ensure TOs
   used with or in support of nuclear weapons specify use of nuclear surety certified
   equipment only (AFI 91-103).
   1.7.3. Procedures for Non-Weapon Nuclear Materials. Coordinate an y procedural
   changes involving other radioactive materials (e.g., depleted uranium counterweights,
   luminous exit markers, optical lens coatings containing thorium, or nucleonic fuel
   indicators), with the USAF Radioisotope Committee Secretariat, HQ AFMOA/SGPR, 8901
   18th St, Brooks AFB TX 78235-5217 (through HQ AFMC/SGBR), IAW AFI 40-201,
   Managing Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force.
1.8. Aircraft Emergency Rescue Data. TO 00-105E-9, Aerospace Emergency Rescue
and Mishap Response Information (Emergency Services), describes aircraft emergency
procedures that must be used by military and civilian fire departments that might
have to respond to military aircraft accidents. (The TO title was formerly ―Aircraft Emergency
Rescue Information (Fire Protection).‖) The TO is available on the Internet at
http://www.robins.af.mil/logistics/lgeda/documents/to00-105E-9.htm. Coordinate all TO
changes that affect the following aircraft subject areas with the Air Force Civil Engineering
Support Agency (AFCESA)/CEXF, DSN 523-6150:
   - Fire hazards.
18                                                       AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


     - Personnel hazards (intakes, exhausts, radar emitting devices, hot brake areas, auxiliary
     power unit (APU) ports, etc.).
     - Aircraft entry (normal and emergency).
     - Engine or APU shutdown (normal and alternative methods).
     - Oxygen and fuel shutoff valves.
     - Ejection or escape system changes in safing, releasing and extraction.
     - Stationary seat restraint systems.
     - Changes to flammable systems (oxygen, fuel, hydraulics, batteries and miscellaneous
     chemicals).
     - Fuselage skin penetration points.
     - Cabin arrangements and personnel locations, or number of personnel on board.
1.9. Budgeting and Funding for TOs (AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures):
     1.9.1. TO Budgeting and Funding. Budgeting and funding for TOs will
     be in accordance with AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Chapter 4, Section E. See also
     the AFMC Financial Management Reference System (FMRS) homepage at
     https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/FM/FMRS/index.htm.
        1.9.1.1. PMs/TO Managers will use the Air Force Knowledge Management (AFKM)
        Comprehensiv e Ai r Force T O P l an (C AFT O P ) C om m uni t y of P ract i c e
        (C oP )    (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-MC-
        TO) to access the AFMC Financial Management Handbook, Chapter 85, The Technical
        Order Requirements Process. Use Chapter 85 procedures to develop a weapon
        system/commodity-specific Comprehensive Air Force TO Plan (CAFTOP) Annex for
        submission to the appropriate Lead Command (AFPD 10-9, Lead Operating Command
        Weapon Systems Management, or AFI 10-901, Lead Operating Command—
        Communications and Information Systems Management) in time to support a budget
        submission for the current Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP).
        1.9.1.2. Funding for physical-distribution digital media (e.g., CD-ROMs or DVDs) is
        managed the same as funding for individual TOs, through the CAFTOP process.
     1.9.2. Modifications. The PM will address all Time Compliance TOs (TCTOs), new
     Operations and Maintenance (O&M) TOs, and O&M TO updates required to support
     planned modifications in the Technical Order Financial Brochure (TOFB) & CAFTOP
     Annex submitted to the Lead Command for funding. However, TCTO and related new TOs or
     TO Updates are funded by the specific modification program. NOTE: Some acquisition
     program contracts provide for system upgrades as part of the contracted effort. Sustainment
     programs must use modification funding for all TCTOs and TCTO-related TO updates,
     publication and distribution.
        1.9.2.1. The TO Manager ensures funding requirements for TCTO acquisition,
        verification, related TO updates, printing and distribution have been considered in
        modification funding packages. Requirements include costs to remove ―before‖ and add
        ―after‖ data (before and after modification) in TOs.
        1.9.2.2. The TO Manager annotates the fund citation or modification number in the print
        package submitted to the local Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS). If the
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                            19


     package also contains non-modification-related changes, the annotation will show the
     related fund citations and the percentage chargeable to each.
     1.9.2.3. Inspection program (-6 TO) changes that require depot maintenance actions
     change Depot Programmed Equipment Maintenance (DPEM) funds obligations. The
     responsible Production Management Activity (PMA) (for TCTO modification kits)
     will contact the ALC DPEM funds point of contact to ensure that adequate funds are
     available. The PMA will procure and manage the available funds per AFI 65-601V1 and
     associated AFMC supplements.
  1.9.3. Spares Replacement. Acquisition funds and the stock fund are used to acquire new
  TOs or TO Updates driven by the need to replace existing spare parts and components with
  new items. The PGM provides the TO Manager with a printout of the replacement item cost
  computation. The TO Manager annotates the total dollar requirement for the maintenance
  of commodity TOs resulting from the acquisition of replacement spare items. The TCM
  will assist the TO Manager with computing the impact of spares replenishment on weapon
  systems TOs based on history and known future acquisitions. The TO Manager provides
  budget requirements by weapon system.
  1.9.4. Calibration TOs. The Air Force Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL) Program,
  Detachment 1 TO Management Office, ML, submits and manages budget requirements for
  calibration TOs and updates.

                                             Chapter 2

                                STANDARD TO PROCEDURES

2.1. TO Management Procedures. The PM/SCM will assign a TO Manager to be
responsible for all aspects of TO acquisition and sustainment. The PM/SCM will also assign
responsibility for the content of applicable TOs to a TCM (usually the Equipment Specialist
[ES] responsible for the equipment being supported by the TOs). For Flight Manual Program
(FMP) publications, the TCM function is assigned to a Flight Manual Manager (FMM), who
may also perform the TO Manager functions in some cases. The functions (but not the
responsibilities) may be delegated to distribution, editorial, and other specialists as required.
Chief Engineers or their delegated representatives will coordinate and approve all TO updates
which could affect system or commodity Operational Safety, Suitability & Effectiveness
(OSS&E) certification (AFI 63-1201). TO Managers will:
     2.1.1. Manage TO Index information. TO configuration and management information for
     all TOs/ TO increments will be properly entered into the JCALS TM Index. Digital file
     versions of formal TOs will be catalogued into an official Air Force repository accessible by
     managers and users. These digital TO files may also be hosted on LAN file servers
     accessible to users (paragraph 1.5.5). Configuration of digital TO files available to users
     must always present the same configuration as the physically distributed version (paper, CD
     ROM, etc.) of the TO, and the JCALS index record must accurately reflect data on the
     distributed versions.
     2.1.2. Monitor Warehouse Inventories. Monitor and control TO warehouse inventories
     through the JCALS System. Develop print/reproduction orders when required, submit paper
     and digital reproduction masters to DAPS, and monitor expenditure of printing funds. Update
     the JCALS inventory record of the TO or TCTO when stock is received using the Due-In
     Receipt function (for Initial Distribution [ID]) or the ―Adjust TM Stock Item Quantities‖
     function for replenishment stock. Not applicable when using Print on Demand or Just-in-
     Time printing instead of physical stockage.
     2.1.3. Request Shipping Label Decks for Initial Distribution (ID) and Requisition
     (RQN) Shipments. Use JCALS or another Air Force-sanctioned system to produce ID and
     RQN shipping labels when required to make initial distribution of a TO/TO Update or to
     fill one-time requisitions. When the PTOWS or other warehousing/shipping label system
     will be used, produce JCALS ID and RQN label files for use in printing labels. See
     paragraph 2.14.
     2.1.4. Establish Shipping Priorities. The TO Manager will direct the TO Warehouse and
     commercial printers to use classified mailing procedures (DOD 5200.1-R) when
     distributing classified TOs. Direct use of first-class mail for all emergency requisitions, all
     distribution of Flight Manual Program (FMP) publications and for ID shipments of TOs and
     TCTOs to overseas destinations.
     2.1.5. Correct TO Configuration and Management Information Errors. TO Managers
     will verify and correct TM Index record errors within 30 calendar days after receiving
     notification of the error. All JCALS users will correct errors in the data they are authorized
     to modify, or will contact the responsible data owner to make corrections. The AF TO
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                21


  Catalog application provides DoD users within the ―.mil‖ domain the capability to report
  such TM Index data quality errors.
  2.1.6. Establish TO Stock Management Levels. TO warehouse stock management
  information is established using the JCALS Publication Stock Number (PSN) functions (see
  TO 00-5-1 for PSN format). TO Managers will use the JCALS ―Manage TM Index, Add Pub
  Stock Number‖ screen to:
     2.1.6.1. Establish the Reorder Point Quantity (―Reorder Pt. Qty‖) at a level that allows
     sufficient time (―Months Lead Time‖ - normally 60 to 90 days) to receive additional
     stock without generation of backorders.
     2.1.6.2. Establish Maximum Issue Quantities (MIQ) at a level that will be issued to a
     TODO without additional justification. Requests for a higher quantity will automatically
     be cancelled, unless Advice Code ―2L‖ is included in the order. The ―2L‖ Advice Code
     will allow the orders to process, but will require proponent approval (paragraph 2.1.8).
     2.1.6.3. Establish a Total Minimum Reserve (―Total Min. Reserve‖) to provide
     sufficient copies for emergency single issue during out-of-stock periods (depending on
     reprint turnaround time and TO demand). The TO proponent organization must always
     retain at least one copy of all active paper TOs and increments for use in reprinting,
     compiling assembly sheets, etc., until there is a digital reproduction master.
     2.1.6.4. TO Reorder Pt. Qty does not apply to TOs with an available digital
     reproduction master being reproduced based on Just-In-Time (JIT) stock levels and/or
     using Print on Demand (POD) management. Maximum Issue Quantities do not apply to
     TOs accessed electronically.
     2.1.6.5. TO media code is included in a JCALS PSN based upon the media that is
     stocked for the TO. PSNs with Digital On Line (11) or printed copy (P) media codes will
     not carry stock information in JCALS. Users will establish subscriptions for one copy of
     each digital-only TO required, but will not be able to requisition TO PSNs that include
     media codes 11 or P.
  2.1.7. Manage Backorders. Requisitions are backordered when the stock balance reaches
  the Reorder Pt. Qty, unless the TO is being provided through POD. JCALS generates a ―BB‖
  status code (TO 00-5-1) when requisitions submitted from the ATOMS or on line using
  JCALS order Publication screen are backordered. JCALS will send an internal ―Reorder
  Notification‖ message to the TO/Distribution Manager when stock is depleted below the
  Reorder Pt. Qty. The manager must generate a ―Backorder Report by Publication‖ to
  determine backorder levels. The TO Manager will:
     2.1.7.1. Clear the pipeline of requisitions and request the warehouse to perform a
     physical inventory of remaining stock. Coordinate with all affected agencies to
     determine future needs for the TO and if there are other special conditions (e.g., an in-
     work revision). Initiate reprint action as required.
     2.1.7.2. Expedite stock replenishment actions to avoid accumulation of backorders. Give
     priority to reprint action on TOs having backorders. Follow-up on reprint action when
     backorders are 30-60 days old.
22                                                        AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


        2.1.7.3. When TCTOs are within 150 days of rescission, fill existing backorders for these
        TCTOs using any Reserve Stock available. Do not reprint the TCTOs to fill backorders.
     2.1.8. Screen TO Requisitions Requiring ―Proponent (sponsor) Approval‖ (paragraph
     1.5.6.). The responsible TO Manager (―proponent or sponsor‖) will screen and approve new
     subscriptions and requisitions in the following instances: (a) the TO is ―flagged‖ for
     Proponent Approval Required in the PSN screen of the JCALS index record for the TO
     (indicated separately for TCTO Series Headers since Series Headers do not have PSNs); (b)
     the TO is classified; (c) requisition quantity exceeds the Maximum Issue Quantity (MIQ)
     and Advice Code 2L is included in the requisition transaction; or (d) the request came from
     an account whose TM Account access codes do not equal or exceed the TO publication
     restriction code assigned to the TO. The TO Manager will obtain concurrence of the Technical
     Content Manager (TCM) when necessary, before approving the subscription/requisition.
        2.1.8.1. Review Label Decks. TO Managers must perform appropriate screening and
        management control of label decks for classified or restricted TOs, using the ―ID Report
        by Publication,‖ before the deck is generated and sent directly to the distribution source,
        government or contractor, authorizing shipment. Withdraw labels for TODO TM
        Accounts not authorized to receive the TO, or cancel any unauthorized requisitions
        using the ―Manage Initial Distribution for a TM; Specify Initial Distribution by Account
        Profile‖ screen, or if only a few accounts need to be deleted use the ―Manage Initial
        Distribution for a TM; Specify Account ID for a Publication.‖ TO Managers will
        withdraw ID shipping labels for Security Assistance Program (SAP) and FMS
        requisitions (D*xxxx TM Account codes) from label decks when printing contractors
        will make ID but cannot provide shipment tracking information. The TO warehouse will
        make SAP/FMS distribution in these cases to ensure shipments are properly tracked.
        2.1.8.2. Action to approve an ATOMS requisition for TO requiring ―Proponent
        (sponsor) Approval‖ will be withheld until receipt of justification letter/e-mail from the
        requesting TODO TM Account. Justification may be included in the remarks block or
        the comments section of requisitions submitted using the JCALS Order Publication
        screen. For requisitions submitted using ATOMS, the TO Manager will disapprove the
        request if a separate letter of justification is not received within 30 days of receipt of
        the JCALS Sponsor Approval workflow job. (ATOMS users will be reminded to submit
        a separate e-mail letter of justification when the TO Request Status is 1S, ―Suspended
        for Sponsor Approval.‖) When requests are disapproved, JCALS will provide a status
        report giving the reason for the disapproval. JCALS Sponsor Approval workflow jobs
        are viewable by the submitting TODO if they are a JCALS user.
     2.1.9. Manage Outside Agency Requests for Air Force TOs. Process requisitions from
     other U.S. government agencies, contractors and civilians in accordance with TO 00-5-1
     and AFJI 21-301, Interservicing of Technical Manuals and Related Technology. Process
     Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for TO data strictly according to DOD 5400.7-
     R, AF supplement 1, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program, and TO 00-5-1.
        2.1.9.1. TOs with Distribution Limitation codes ―B‖ through ―X‖ may be exempt from
        release under FOIA, according to DODD 5230.25, DOD 5400.7-R/AF Sup 1, and AFI
        61-204.
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                 23


      2.1.9.2. Requests for TOs from activities or individuals outside the limitations
      specified by the assigned Distribution Statement must be approved by the DoD
      Controlling Office (responsible TO Manager and TCM). If the responsible office cannot
      be identified, refer requests for TO release to HQ AFMC/LGYE, e-mail:
      AF.TOPP@wpafb.af.mil, to determine the proper release authority.
      2.1.9.3. If the TO or other technical data is not marked, it will handled as Distribution
      Statement ―F,‖ and will be referred to the responsible TCM for assignment of an
      appropriate Distribution Statement prior to being issued.
   2.1.10. Publish TOs on Digital Media. The TO Manager for the collection of TOs
   published on CD-ROM/DVD, with coordination from the PM and Lead Command, is
   responsible for CD-ROM/ DVD format, numbering, labeling, publication, packaging and
   distribution. Funding for CD-ROMs/ DVDs is managed the same as funding for individual
   TOs, through the CAFTOP/TOFB process. The content of TOs on a CD-ROM/DVD must
   be identical to that of the individual (stand-alone) paper TOs. NOTE: The same general
   rules applicable to CD-ROMs used to publish and distribute TOs will apply to Digital
   Versatile Discs (DVD) used for TO publication/distribution, pending development of a
   publication specifically addressing DVDs. In this manual, any reference to CD-ROM will
   also include DVD.
      2.1.10.1. The TCM for the CD/DVD, in coordination with the TO Manager and Using
      Command, is responsible for determining which TO files will be included on the
      CD/DVD, and for developing the standard files required by MIL-STD-38784, MIL-
      HDBK-9660, DoD Produced CD-ROM Products, and this manual (paragraph 2.5.5).
      Classified and unclassified TOs will not be mixed.
      2.1.10.2. The TO Manager will determine routine update intervals, in conjunction with
      the Lead Command, and the TCMs of the TOs included on the CD/DVD.
   2.1.11. Publish TOs on the Internet (World Wide Web – WWW). TO listings on the
   host servers will include the TO Number, Date, Title, and Change Number/Date to allow
   users to verify configuration of downloaded copies without opening or downloading the file.
   Additional information, such as TO Manager or TCM information, is optional. Note the
   server URL in the Catalog Notes field of the JCALS TM Index record for the TO and
   provide the URL to the Material Systems Group Technical Data Division (MSG/MMF), e-
   mail: topp@wpafb.af.mil, for posting on the TO System Information Page, so users have a
   single point for locating Internet TO sites. Ensure the host server has appropriate access
   controls to protect limited distribution TOs and data (see 1.5.5). Users may require
   username and password to connect to the server or to download the TO if the distribution
   limitation statement for the TO is other than ―A‖.
   2.1.12. Ensure Configuration Control of Multi-Media TOs. When TOs are published
   in more than one medium (e.g., in paper and on CD-ROM), information about the
   configuration of the TO (TO Index data) and all formats must reflect the same content
   configuration (see TO 00-5-1).
2.2. TO Numbering and Indexing.
   2.2.1. On-Line JCALS TO Numbering Procedures. TO Managers are responsible for
   requesting numbers for and indexing assigned TOs, using the JCALS ―Manage TM
24                                                       AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


     Numbering; Assign a Publication Number‖ process, the procedures in the JCALS Desktop
     Instructions (DI), and the guidance in TO 00-5-18, USAF Technical Order Numbering
     System. TCTO series header numbers are assigned according to TOs 00-5-15, Air Force
     Time Compliance Technical Order System, and 00-5-18.
        2.2.1.1. Before a number is requested for TOs covering specific equipment and end items
        (except for complete aircraft and missiles), the TO Manager, in conjunction with the
        TCM, must ensure that data on the equipment covered by the TO has been entered into
        JCALS (see Attachment 2). Use either the TO Catalog ―TO-Equipment Cross
        Reference‖ function or the JCALS ―Generate TM Index Report; Interservice Technical
        Information Exchange System (ITIES) Cross-Reference Report‖ function to determine if
        the equipment is already listed in JCALS. If the equipment is not listed, use the ―Perform
        Acquisition; Manage Item Data‖ process screens to enter data about a new equipment
        item. The data is used to set up and change the TO number to equipment number
        cross-reference data in the TO Catalog.
        2.2.1.2. TO Managers will develop TO titles in accordance with Attachment 3. An
        accurate title is an essential element in determining the correct TO number.
        2.2.1.3. All numbering requests must be reviewed and approved by the numbering
        specialist responsible for specific categories and types of TOs: for most O&M, general,
        methods & procedures and time compliance TOs, this is the USAF Numbering
        Specialist, OC-ALC/LGLUB; for Precision Measuring Equipment (PME), nuclear
        weapon and EOD TOs, see paragraph 2.2.1.6. All requests for publication of new TOs
        in Category 00 must first be approved by HQ AFMC/ LGYE (TO 00-5-18).
        2.2.1.4. Once the USAF TO Numbering Specialist (OC-ALC/LGLUB) reviews and
        approves the requested TO number, additional information about the TO may be entered
        into the newly established JCALS TM Index record for the TO. The JCALS DI lists
        required information that must be added for a new TO Number. The TO Manager must
        place the TO Archive (OC-ALC/TILUB, TM Account F*10SJ) on ID for all new TO
        numbers assigned.
        2.2.1.5. TO Managers will request OC-ALC/LGLUB to establish a TCTO series header
        for an aircraft, missile or engine category when a new TO series is established. Request
        new TCTO series headers for other TO categories when the first TCTO is in
        preparation. A separate TCTO series header must be established when individual TCTOs
        in the series will be assigned different classifications. Once a TCTO series header
        number is approved, JCALS will automatically number individual TCTOs in the
        series. Although JCALS provides the capability to automatically assign TCTO Data
        Codes when the Index record for a new TCTO is established, the capability allows
        duplicate Data Code numbers to be assigned across the Air Force JCALS enterprise.
        Therefore, when a JCALS record for a new TCTO is established, the JCALS-assigned
        data code must be replaced by the next sequential number from a block of data codes
        provided by OC-ALC/LGLUB. Contact OC-ALC/LGLUB directly if data codes are
        needed.
        2.2.1.6. Air Force Metrology & Calibration (AFMETCAL) Det 1/ML, numbers
        calibration TOs for Test Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE); the Nuclear
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                              25


     Weapon Logistics Division, AAC/NWLT numbers nuclear TOs listed in TO index 0-1-
     11N-C; and Det 63 AAC/WMO numbers joint-service nonnuclear EOD TOs.
  2.2.2. Off-Line JCALS TO Numbering Procedures. TO Managers and contractors
  who do not have on-line access to JCALS will complete AFMC IMTs 203, Technical
  Order Numbering, Indexing, and Control Record and 204, Technical Order
  Numbering, Indexing, and Control Record (Continuation) for numbering actions, as
  follows:
     2.2.2.1. AFMC IMT 203. This IMT is used to request assignment of TO numbers, to
     submit TO index source data, to set up the TO index record, and to update, change, or
     cancel these records when appropriate. The IMT is submitted to OC-ALC/LGLUB (or
     one of the other numbering OPRs, paragraph 2.2.1.6) for JCALS TO number
     assignment.
     2.2.2.2. AFMC IMT 204. This IMT is used to provide data about the supported weapon
     system or equipment for creation of a JCALS record, or to update TO number to
     equipment number cross-reference data for all equipment covered by a TO (including
     non-Air Force equipment). The AFMC IMT 204 is submitted concurrently with AFMC
     IMTs 203 for initial TO number assignment requests, to the ES responsible for the
     supported equipment and having JCALS access. Equipment data is entered using the
     JCALS ―Perform Acquisition; Manage Item Data‖ process. The TO-Equipment number
     cross-reference data reduces the likelihood of procuring duplicate TOs. The AFMC
     IMT 204 is not required for complete aircraft and missiles, or for TOs that are not
     equipment-related (such as most MPTOs) and TCTOs. CD-ROMs/DVDs and other
     media containing multiple TO files are also exempt unless the medium covers only one
     piece of equipment.
     2.2.2.3. Data in blocks 1 through 17 of AFMC IMT 203 are required as source data for a
     new TO or TCTO. Only blocks 1, 2, 11, 14, 15 and 16 are required to establish a TCTO
     series. The Next Higher Assembly (NHA—block 4) and National Stock Class (NSC—
     block 7) for the equipment covered by the TO are mandatory for TO number assignment
     (except for weapon system or engine TOs, or MPTOs). If the equipment has been
     assigned a Materiel Management Aggregation Code (MMAC), the code should be
     included with the NSC in block 7. The identity of the designated equipment repair
     facility (if known) should be shown on the AFMC IMT 203 in block 17,
     ―Remarks.‖ The nomenclature, NSC and MMAC must be the same on both IMTs.
     Requests must be submitted as soon as possible, to permit TO indexing and requirements
     determination. If immediate numbering is urgent, the PM may contact the OC-
     ALC/LGLU Branch Chief with a telephone request. The request must justify use of
     emergency procedures and provide complete AFMC IMTs 203 and 204 data elements.
  2.2.3. Assigning Numbers. OC-ALC/LGLUB (or one of the other numbering specialist
  organizations, 2.2.1.6) will assign the TO number according to rules in TO 00-5-18. LGLUB
  returns a copy of the AFMC IMT 203 to the initiating TO Manager to provide status of the
  action requested and show the TO number assigned for new TOs.
  2.2.4. Renumbering Technical Orders. The TO Manager may only request TO
  renumbering to correct serious numbering errors caused by erroneous or insufficient source
  data before the TO is published and distributed. Published TOs will only be renumbered
26                                                      AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


     when the assigned number prevents effective location or use of the TO, or the scope or
     range of the functionality covered by the TO changes significantly. TOs will not be
     renumbered to align with local sequence numbers or similar cross-reference identifiers.
     Renumbering must be approved by OC-ALC/LGLUB just like original TO number
     assignment.
        2.2.4.1. On-line TO Managers submit TO renumbering requests using the appropriate
        JCALS screens.
        2.2.4.2. Off-line TO Managers complete and submit AFMC IMTs 203 and 204 as above
        to request TO renumbering, input new equipment numbers and related data under the
        new TO number, and provide justification for the action.
        2.2.4.3. When LGLUB approves a new number for unpublished TOs, the TO record is
        updated and subscriptions submitted against the original number are automatically
        changed to the new one.
        2.2.4.4. When published TOs are renumbered, JCALS will automatically convert all
        past revisions and changes to the new number, but each supplement is considered a
        separate TO number and must be individually renumbered.
        2.2.4.5. After obtaining a new TO number, but prior to superseding the old number, the
        TO Manager must transfer TODO subscription requirements to the new TO number
        (using the JCALS Like Item ID screen).
        2.2.4.6. When the TO is renumbered, the manager must enter a note about the replaced
        number in the JCALS index Catalog Notes field, and issue a TO Change with both the
        old and new numbers on the title page. The warehouse function must physically re-
        identify TO stocks to the new TO number and adjust records as appropriate. In either
        case, the replaced TO number can never be reused.
     2.2.5. Changes to Numbering Policy. OC-ALC/LGLUB submits requests for changes to
     numbering policy to HQ AFMC/LGYE for approval. LGLUB provides information copies
     of the request to all ALCs and PCs for comments and concurrence.
     2.2.6. Indexing. When OC-ALC/LGLUB approves a new TO number or a TM update is
     generated, the TO Manager will:
        2.2.6.1. Complete JCALS TO Index information using the ―Add Pub Stock Number‖ and
        ―Update an Index Entry‖ screens. Improper or incomplete index data will prevent
        cataloguing the TO in the Reference Library, viewing TO index data in the AF TO
        Catalog application, subscribing to or requisitioning the TO using either JCALS or
        ATOMS, and printing distribution labels. See DI Table 2 for mandatory index entries.
        Additional mandatory entries are the assigned Distribution Statement Code (A through F
        or X) and primary Reason for the code assigned.
           2.2.6.1.1. For Preliminary TOs (paragraph 2.4) and TO updates, publication
           (―PUB‖) Basic, Revision or Change dates will be entered when the reproduction
           masters are sent for printing and distribution.
           2.2.6.1.2. When indexing unclassified updates to a classified TO, TO Managers
           must first index the updates in JCALS, which will assign the parent TO classification
           to the update. Then the TO Manager must change the classification of the
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                  27


         unclassified update only to ―Unclassified,‖ ensure the JCALS indexing fields "PUB
         TITLE SECURITY" and "PUB SECURITY" indicate ―Unclassified,‖ and verify that
         both fields match. NOTE: If the Security fields do not match, the JCALS index
         record will default to the parent TO classification, which will cause misidentification
         of an unclassified change as Classified.
         2.2.6.1.3. After completing the index update, verify that the Air Force TO Archive
         (formerly known as the ―Repository‖), OC-ALC/LGLUB, TODO Code 0086, TM
         Account F*10SJ, is on subscription for the basic TO/TCTO Header Series. If not,
         establish a subscription of one (1) copy for the Archive. When the TO is published in
         both digital and paper copies, send only the digital version to the Archive.
     2.2.6.2. Review and index ITOs IAW AFMCI 21-302. Index Interim TOs (ITOs) upon
     transmittal of the message, using a PSN with media code ―P‖ (Printed Copy). Interim
     TOs will be marked as available for published index but not available for distribution.
     This will ensure that users can see information about the ITO but cannot requisition it.
     Include the ITO message DTG or other identifying information and the TO numbers of
     any companion TCTOs in the Catalog Notes.
     2.2.6.3. Supersede TOs and TO increments when replaced by a revision or new
     increment in the same TO number family. Supersede TOs when replaced by or
     incorporated into another TO in a different number family. NOTE: Add a ―Catalog
     Note‖ to the record of any superseded TO replaced by a different TO, similar to
     ―Replaced by TO XXX-XXX-XX.‖ Add a matching Catalog Note to the replacement TO
     record, such as ―Formerly TO XXX-XXX-XX‖ or ―Includes TOs XXX-XXX-XX.
     2.2.6.4. Rescind TOs and TO increments when they are deleted without replacement.
     Rescind TCTOs when rescission dates are reached (see 2.11). Rescind TCTO series
     headers when the entire TO series is deleted.
     2.2.6.5. Perform warehouse inventory record and digital repository file maintenance as
     necessary.
  2.2.7. Indexing TOs Published on the Internet. TO Managers and TCMs uploading
  digital TO files onto Web servers will provide the local System Administrator (SA) or Web
  Master with required TO file information (TO number, date, title, and Change
  number/date) for the server listing. Additional information, such as the TO Manager and
  TCM points of contact may also be listed.
     2.2.7.1. For the initial publication on the Internet, the TO index record will be updated
     to add a PSN for the ―digital on-line‖ version. The JCALS TO Index record, Catalog
     Notes field will be used to document the Internet address of the host server, the digital
     format and special viewing software required.
     2.2.7.2. Notify MSG/MMF of new TO numbers published on the Internet via e-
     mail to topp@wpafb.af.mil. MMF will add the TOs and URLs to the TO System
     Information Page.
  2.2.8. Numbering and Indexing Digital Media. Digital media include CD-ROMs,
  DVDs, and other physical recording media. The media will be numbered, indexed and
28                                                         AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


     managed as discreet TOs in accordance with TO 00-5-18. The only difference between the
     types of media is the suffix used to indicate media type (e.g., ―CD,‖ ―DV,‖ etc.).
        2.2.8.1. Media containing TO Sets will be assigned TO Numbers in a manner similar
        to TCTO Series numbers, with the applicable suffix ―-XX-#‖ as part of the number. The
        medium manager will request a TO number for the disc/tape from OC-ALC/LGLUB,
        based on the following guidance:
            2.2.8.1.1. If multiple categories of TOs are contained on a disc, the lowest TO
            category number will be used for the disc number.
            2.2.8.1.2. If TOs for multiple systems or commodities are included on the medium,
            use a TO number which will help identify all of the systems/commodities. (See
            the instructions for establishing a TCTO Series Header number in TO 00-5-18.)
            2.2.8.1.3. If multiple TO types are included (i.e., operations, maintenance and
            inspection), either use the lowest of the included dash (-) numbers for the disc/tape
            itself, or omit the TO type designator altogether.
        2.2.8.2. Title the disc/tape to help users to identify the general nature and coverage of
        the TOs contained, and include a short description of the specific TOs on the medium
        (e.g., 00-5, 00-20, & 00-25 Series). The complete title will be listed in the TO index,
        while an abbreviated version (without listing included TOs) will be used on the medium
        and sleeve/case labels (e.g., ―Methods and Procedures TOs‖). Specify the digital
        format and viewing software required in a separate ―Catalog Note.‖ When appropriate,
        add the word ―SET‖ after ―TECHNICAL MANUAL‖ on the labels.
        2.2.8.3. The index record for the medium will list the included TOs using the
        ―Associated Publications‖ function of the JCALS ―Update a TM Index.‖ The TO
        Managers for each TO contained on the medium will update applicable TO index
        listings to add a ―Catalog Note‖ listing the TO number of the medium (and if also
        published on the Internet, the applicable URL) where the TO is published, and the digital
        format used.
     2.2.9. Unit Price. Any TOs to be released to an FMS customer must have an estimated
     average cost entered in the Unit Price field of the JCALS index record. This data is printed on
     the DD Form 1348-2 and provides customs information to Freight Forwarders. Because this
     data and the TOs affected varies frequently, HQ AFMC/LGYE will update the Unit Price
     field quarterly for all TOs managed in JCALS. TO Managers are responsible for adding
     this data to shipping documents for TOs not managed in JCALS.
2.3. Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form Development.
     2.3.1. Development. The TCM responsible for a TO prescribing use of unique AFTO
     IMTs will manage the forms according to AFI 33-360V2, Content Management Program-
     Information Management Tool (CMP-IMT). All AFTO IMTs are published through
     88CG/SCQIP, DSN 787-7924, 3810 Communications Blvd, WPAFB OH 45433-5601. The
     TO Manager must coordinate with the 88CG to release new and revised AFTO IMTs
     concurrently with the prescribing TO updates.
     2.3.2. AFTO Form Availability. Most AFTO forms are available electronically (―IMT‖
     versions) on the AF Publishing page (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/) under the link to
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                   29


   ―Information Management Tools/Forms,‖ and the subsequent link to ―AF Technical
   Order‖ (right column). Manifold or card-stock forms are available from the AF Publications
   Distribution Center (AFPDC) (link to ―Physical Products‖ at top of the Forms page). Forms
   may be computer-generated (―CG‖) when specifically authorized in the prescribing TO.
   When forms are not available electronically, the TO Manager may elect to provide a blank
   copy of AFTO forms authorized for local reproduction at the back of the prescribing TO.
2.4. Preliminary TOs.
   2.4.1. Management. JCALS will only manage Preliminary TO (PTO) numbering and
   indexing. TO Managers must establish procedures to manage and control distribution of PTOs
   prior to formalization and publication.
   2.4.2. Numbering and Indexing Procedures. The TO Manager requests a TO number
   for PTOs using the word ―Preliminary‖ as part of the TO title. The number request must
   have a temporary Pub Date assigned. OC-ALC/LGLUB enters the approved number in the
   JCALS Pub Index. The TO Manager will use the ―Manage TO Index, Update Issue Data‖
   screens to delete the temporary Pub Date, verify the flags for ―Preliminary Publication‖ and
   ―Available for Published Index‖ are set to ―Yes,‖ and the flag for ―Available for
   Distribution‖ is set to ―No.‖ The warehouse will not stock, store, or issue PTOs.
   2.4.3. Verifying and Formalizing PTOs. After the PTO has been verified to the
   maximum extent possible (TO 00-5-3, Air Force Technical Manual Acquisition Procedures),
   the TO Manager develops a TO update to convert the PTO to a formal TO. Prior to ID label
   generation for the formal TO update (JCALS Due-In screen), the TO Manager will enter the
   Pub Date. The Available for Distribution flag in the TO index is automatically set to ―Yes‖
   when the TO Manager completes the JCALS Due-in Receipt function to indicate that stock
   is available to make Initial Distribution. JCALS will automatically enter the ID Ship date
   when the labels are printed, and this date is copied to the JCALS TM Index record
   ―Distribution Date‖ field. The date is extracted and presented in the AF TO Catalog
   application record for the TO.
2.5. TO Updates. TO updates consist of revisions, changes, and several kinds of supplements
(see TO 00-5-1). See AFI 11-215 for policies and timelines for updating FMP publications.
   2.5.1. General.
       2.5.1.1. TO Update Categories. Updates are categorized as Emergency, Urgent or
       Routine (TO 00-5-1). Base the update category on its impact to the system or commodity
       mission effectiveness, safety or maintainability. Limit Emergency and Urgent submittals
       to technical and safety-related changes. Hold non-technical changes to paper TOs for
       implementation with routine technical updates on the affected or backing pages. All
       updates to TOs distributed and used only in digital format should be incorporated into
       the master TO file prior to distribution. Updates must be published within the time limits
       specified in Figure 3.1.
       2.5.1.2. Preparation. Prepare updates organically whenever possible, or acquire them
       from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or overflow contractors. TO updates
       will not include instructions for ―write-in‖ changes, except as authorized in TO 00-5-1.
30                                                        AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


        2.5.1.3. TO Updates for Obsolete Systems and Commodities. Obsolete systems and
        commodities include those still in limited use or scheduled to leave the inventory within
        two years. Users will submit routine recommended changes for TOs on ―obsolete‖
        systems and commodities. However, the TO Manager/TCM will hold routine TO updates
        in abeyance pending the decision to rescind or update the TO. The TO Manager will
        provide an adequate schedule for updating the affected TOs when no review is
        scheduled. In these cases, the updates will normally be published as ITOs or TO Page
        Supplements (TOPS). The TO Manager will make Emergency and Urgent updates as
        usual.
     2.5.2. TO Change and Revision Practices. A TO Change and TO Revision are the
     principal means for routinely updating TOs. The TO Manager will determine whether to issue
     a revision or a change to the TO.
        2.5.2.1. When To Consider a Revision. A revision is a more practical means to update a
        TO when a large percentage of the TO pages are Change pages. Use the following
        criteria to determine when to issue a revision:
            - When the TO will be accessed and used as a digital file.
            - When 70 percent or more of the basic TO (including the current update) has been
            changed (see paragraph 2.5.2.2.).
            - When there is a change to equipment configuration, compliance with new
            military specifications, etc.
            - When updating brief TOs (eight or fewer pages), unless the change will be issued
            as difference data sheets.
            - When a TO publication is being declassified by removing classified data, to
            prevent issuing warehouse stocks marked as classified. Exceptions are authorized.
            TOs may be declassified by issuing a TO change if cost effective and the change is
            merged with existing warehouse stocks before any subsequent issue.
            - When the TO is a combined manual (e.g., Maintenance with Illustrated Parts
            Breakdown [IPB], etc.) and has an abbreviated title page and no ―A‖ page.
        2.5.2.2. When Not To Consider a Revision:
            - The TO is usable as is (even if 100% of the pages have changed);
            - A revision is not cost-effective (very large TOs or TOs with extensive distribution,
            IF usability has not been seriously impaired); or
            - An extensive delay in publication will result, unless the other factors show that a
            revision is necessary.
        2.5.2.3. New or Revised Technical Manual Specifications & Standards (TMSS) (TO 00-
        5-3). The TO Manager determines whether or not to issue a TO revision when the
        governing MILSPEC or MIL-STD used to prepare the TO is revised. The TO Manager
        may direct contractors who will revise the TO to use a later version of the governing
        specifications when there will be no change in contract costs. Any direction affecting
        contract cost must be coordinated with the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) before
        going to the contractor.
        2.5.2.4. Numbering Changes and Revisions. The TO Manager assigns an identifying
        number to each TO change and revision being published, using the JCALS ―Manage
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                  31


     TM Index; Update an Index Entry‖ function. The numbers for changes must be three
     digits long, prefixed by zeros if necessary. The numbers for revisions must be four digits
     long, prefixed by zeros if necessary. The TO Change number will appear on the title page
     and each page containing changed data. The revision number identifies the version or
     edition of the TO and will not be printed on the TO Title page except when indicated in
     the Supersede Notice. The TO Manager should initially set the JCALS TM Index
     ―Available for Distribution‖ and ―Available for Published Index‖ flags to ―No.‖ When
     the Revision or TO Change is approved and ready for printing and distribution, the TO
     Manager must review and complete the update of TM Index information and set the
     ―Available for Published Index‖ flags to ―Yes.‖ Once stock is received to make ID
     (JCALS ―Due In Receipt‖), the ―Available for Distribution‖ flag is automatically set to
     ―Yes.‖ ID labels are then generated. The date entered as the ―ID Ship Date‖ will
     automatically be copied to the TM Index record ―Estimated Distribution Date.‖
     2.5.2.5. Verification. All changes to technical data procedures, no matter how they are
     published (TO Change or Supplement, AFMC IMT 202, etc.), shall be verified by
     performance or as otherwise specified by TO 00-5-3. Performance verification of TO
     updates related to a TCTO shall be accomplished concurrently with the TCTO
     verification.
     2.5.2.6. Pre-Publication Reviews. The final draft (reproduction copy or digital file) of TO
     updates and TCTOs must receive a pre-publication review for technical accuracy,
     currency and adequacy (depth of coverage); as well as conformance to MILSPEC
     requirements. The review shall be jointly conducted by the TO Manager (TO Mgr) and
     the TCM, with the assistance of Subject Matter Experts (SME) as required. The following
     checklist will be followed:
        - Procedures and illustrations for technical accuracy, completeness and readability.
        (TCM)
        - Coordination with affected functional areas–Engineering, Safety, Nuclear Surety,
        Bio-Environmental Engineering, Foreign Disclosure Office, etc. (TCM)
        - Update compliance to MILSPEC format. (TO Mgr)
        - Accuracy of Title Page information–dates, supersede notice, distribution limitations,
        etc. against information about the TO Update in the TM Index record. (TO Mgr)
        NOTE: The TO Manager must ensure that the Issue Date in the JCALS TM Index
        record is the same as the TO or Change Date on the TO title page.
        - Accuracy of the List of Effective Pages (LEP). (TO Mgr)
        - Changed page numbering and marking. (TO Mgr)
        2.5.2.6.1. TO development or support contracts should allow for TO Manager
        review and approval of draft TOs before delivery of reproducible masters to the
        government. If the information in the draft must be published immediately, any
        serious technical errors in the review copy may be corrected with a RAC or an
        interim safety or operational supplement that is distributed concurrently with the TO.
        Correct less critical errors through the routine update process.
32                                                       AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


            2.5.2.6.2. For updates published in-house (organically), errors should be corrected
            prior to submitting the reproduction copy to DAPS. Any new changes developed
            during the review must be submitted for the next routine TO update, not added to the
            current increment.
        2.5.2.7. Periodic Pre-Publication Review. If publication of routine changes or revisions
        must be deferred for any reason, the TCM, in coordination with the TO Manager, must
        review the publication package every 90 days from the date of the deferral decision for
        possible priority upgrading.
            2.5.2.7.1. Base the upgrade decision on the potential to negatively affect OSS&E of
            the military system or commodity resulting from continued publication delays. The
            TCM/TO Manager should consider such things as negative maintenance trends,
            increased occurrence of safety incidents and the cumulative effects of aggregated
            changes which, if not addressed, are made worse by unpublished TO updates.
            2.5.2.7.2. Only those portions of the change package actually requiring upgrade
            will be extracted from the package and published as an IOS or ISS, pending routine
            publication of the formal change or revision. If the entire package must be upgraded,
            publish the formal update within the upgraded priority category timelines. The TO
            Manager shall coordinate Interim TOs with the TCM and Lead Command prior to
            issue.
        2.5.2.8. TO Updates Related to TCTOs. The TCM/FMM will update TOs and FMP
        publications affected by TCTOs, and the TO Manager will release the updates
        concurrently with the driving TCTO (Chapter 4).
        2.5.2.9. Joint Service TMs. The Air Force OPR of a Joint Service TM managed by
        another service (Army, Navy, etc.) will issue an Air Force-only supplement to change Air
        Force compliance with procedures in a TM managed by another service.
        Coordination with the other service is not required when the changes affect only the
        Air Force, but a copy of the supplement will be provided to the lead service TM
        Manager for information. If the change is subsequently incorporated into the TM, the AF
        supplement will be rescinded. When the Air Force is the lead service, the TO Manager
        must fully coordinate proposed updates with all affected services prior to publication.
        2.5.2.10. Country Standard TO (CSTO) Updates. The equipment contractor normally
        produces CSTO updates under an FMS contract (TO 00-5-19, Security Assistance
        Technical Order Program).
     2.5.3. Digital TO Formats. All new and major modification programs must acquire TOs in
     a digital format compatible with the authoring and managing tools in the TO Management
     Information System and with current TMSS (TO 00-5-3). Before converting Legacy
     (existing) TO data to a digital authoring format, use and changeability must be considered
     (see Figure 2.1, TO Digitization Decision Tree).
        2.5.3.1. Digital Distribution Media Sustainment. Only Changes and Revisions will be
        used to update digitally distributed baseline TO files. ―Baseline TO files‖ are the
        official, published (accessible to users) TO files consisting of the basic digital TO file
        with any published change files merged (posted) into the baseline TO file. The use of
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                 33


     formal supplements, including TOPS, for updating digital baseline TOs is discouraged
     and will be severely limited (see TO 00-5-1).
     2.5.3.2. The TO change or revision will be merged with or replace the baseline TO file
     for digital distribution. The standalone digital change or revised TO file will be used to
     produce a master for printing and distribution of paper copies.
     2.5.3.3. For emergency and urgent updates, the TO Manager or TCM will develop
     digital RACs whenever possible, instead of Interim Operational or Safety Supplements
     (IOS or ISS – see TO 00-5-1 and AFMCI 21-302). The digital RAC file will normally
     be merged with the baseline TO file, and the merged TO and standalone RAC files will
     be accessed from the Internet or downloaded via FTP. Users will be notified of the
     RAC and how to access/download the updated TO file and RAC using the Interim TO
     distribution process from AFMCI 21-302. The standalone RAC is distributed to allow
     local printing of the change for updating paper copies of the TO.
  2.5.4. Supplement Processes. The TO Manager numbers and indexes a new TO
  supplements by using the JCALS DI procedure, ―Add a Supplement Number to the
  Index.‖ Supplement sequence numbers are assigned automatically by JCALS, and restart
  at ―1‖ after each TO revision. The new supplement is then distributed according to AFMCI
  21-302 (for interim supplements), or TO 00-5-1 (for formal supplements). For FMP manual
  supplements, which have sequential supplement numbering for the life of the manual, the
  FMM will submit a JCALS Incident Report (IR) to request renumbering of the Supplement
  number proposed by JCALS if required. NOTE: Do not use the DI ―Renumber TM‖
  procedure to renumber FMM Supplements because it also renumbers the supplements for
  earlier FM Revisions. ATTENTION: Before assigning a PSN to a new supplement, return to
  the ―Update an Index Entry‖ screen and select the new supplement TM number. Otherwise,
  the PSN will be assigned to the basic TO. This is true for changes & revisions as well.
  2.5.5. CD-ROM/DVD Format. CD-ROMs and DVDs containing digital TO files will be
  formatted and labeled according to MIL-HDBK-9660 and MIL-STD-38784. The CD/DVD
  must contain a ―content.txt‖ file containing the information required by MIL-HDBK-
  9660, and may contain a ―readme.txt‖ file (how to use the CD/DVD), an ―Index‖ file (to
  automatically direct users to the correct TO files), and if necessary, a copy of the viewing
  software.
     2.5.5.1. Content.txt File. The following information will be included in the required
     content.txt file included on all TO CD-ROM/DVD publications. Other information is
     also required in the content.txt file. See MIL-HDBK-9660 for further information:
         - DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION: (TO number)
         - TITLE: TECHNICAL MANUAL SET; (name)
         - EDITION: (First, Second, etc.)
         - VOLUME IDENTIFIER: (DoD Activity Address Code [DODAAC – 6 characters]
         + TO Category [2 numbers] + Index Number [3 numbers]) (11 digits total)
         - MAINTENANCE AND UPDATE FREQUENCY: (update period)
         - ORIGINATOR COMMENTS: (information on formats, etc.)
         - DOCUMENT ABSTRACT: (purpose of CD/DVD)
         - POINT OF CONTACT: (CD/DVD TO Manager, address, e-mail, & phone)
         - ORIGINATOR: (CD/DVD TCM, address, e-mail, & phone)
34                                                         AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


            - TO POCs: (For each TO file included on the CD/DVD, list the TO Manager &
            TCM names, organizations, e-mail addresses, & DSN phone numbers)
        2.5.5.2. Readme.txt file (Optional). Use the same format criteria established by MIL-
        HDBK-9660 for the content.txt file. The file may be included if required to describe
        access to and use of viewer software, access to and use of any other programs on the
        disk (such as ATOMS), and/or other helpful information not included in the content.txt
        file. If used, the readme.txt file should have a table of contents to help the user identify
        and navigate to needed information.
        2.5.5.3. Index File. TO.MART (paragraph 1.2.4) is the indexing and retrieval software
        program developed by the Technical Data Division of the Business Information SPO
        (MSG/MMF) for cataloging and access to locally required digital TO files. The program
        is available at https://tech-data.wpafb.af.mil/field/ToolsMenu.htm.
        2.5.5.4. CD-ROM/DVD and Case Labels. Labels are formatted according to MIL-STD-
        38784.
2.6. TO Updates Due to Equipment Modification or Replenishment Spares
Procurement. N e w specification requirements, modifications and replenishment spares
procurement can result in new inventory items for replacement or replenishment issue. New TOs
may be required and/or existing TOs updated or rescinded.
     2.6.1. Coordination and Advisement. The TCM will coordinate with the reparable
     assembly or system PM to determine if safety, life support or critical systems are involved.
     The TCM and TO Manager will identify and advise affected TO Managers, PMs, SAP users
     and other DoD agencies (Army, Navy, etc.) of the proposed new or modified equipment/end
     item and recommend updating of affected TOs. Advisement must include known systems
     or commodities TOs, when stocks of the original equipment/end item TOs will be
     exhausted, and specific TO updates required (if known). Coordination and advisement
     requirements are not required for common NSC items (e.g., nuts, bolts, resistors, etc.) unless
     safety, life support, or critical systems or material are involved.
     2.6.2. Processes. In conjunction with the TO Manager, the TCM will initiate acquisition of
     new TOs or TO updates for commodities/equipment/end items under TCM control. Notify
     the TO Manager in writing to rescind obsolete TOs as required. Keep using commands
     informed of the TO status and anticipated publication date(s). Follow up with the Using
     Command to ensure TO updates are distributed and support requirements of users have been
     satisfied.
2.7. TO Update Publication. NOTE: Perform periodic reviews of change packages IAW
paragraph 2.5.2.7 if publication must be deferred.
     2.7.1. General. The TO Manager or TCM will use the JCALS ―Prepare TM Change
     Package‖ process to aggregate all approved Recommended Changes (RCs - see Chapter 3)
     submitted since the last TO update. For each JCALS ―Prepare TM Change Package,‖ the
     TO Manager determines if the updates will be developed organically or through contractor
     support. NOTE: The electronic AFMC IMT 252 process may be used when some or all RCs
     have been submitted outside of JCALS.
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                35


     2.7.1.1. If a production contract is available for contractor preparation of TO updates,
     the TO Manager forwards a copy of the JCALS ―Prepare TM Change Package‖ work
     folder to the responsible procuring agency by JCALS Workflow Manager (WFM) or by
     using AFMC IMT 252, with a letter of transmittal included in the work folder.
     2.7.1.2. If a production contract is NOT available and organic development is not
     practical, the TO Manager forwards a copy of the JCALS work folder to the responsible
     contracting office using JCALS WFM or by using AFMC IMT 252, with an included
     letter of transmittal requesting preparation by overflow contractors or Government
     Printing Office (GPO)/DAPS assets, as appropriate.
     2.7.1.3. MIL-STD-38784 Disposition Notices and Handling and Destruction Notices
     will be placed on the title or T-2 pages of all unclassified TOs on an attrition basis.
  2.7.2. Creating RACs. The TCM will develop the RAC content; the TCM, TO Manager
  or editor will prepare (format) the RAC and create a merged RAC/basic digital baseline TO
  file for distribution to TODOs. The following steps are involved in creating a RAC:
     2.7.2.1. The TCM identifies and/or validates an Emergency or Urgent change
     requirement, and develops corrective action using the JCALS ―Recommend a TM
     Change‖ process (JCALS DI), obtains coordination and approval, and submits the RC to
     the TO Manager.
     2.7.2.2. The TO Manager assigns a TO change number to the RAC.
         2.7.2.2.1. RACs will be identified using the next sequential TO change number. If
         the next change number has already been assigned to a routine change currently in the
         publishing cycle ―no-change window,‖ then the RAC number will be the next in
         sequence, and a supersede notice will be added to the Title page to specify RAC
         effectivity. The ―no-change window‖ is the period after preparation of a reproduction
         package and before publication and distribution when further changes to the package
         are no longer cost effective.
         2.7.2.2.2. ―No-Change Window‖ Procedures. Emergency RACs will be provided
         within 48 hours of TO Manager/TCM notification of the problem. The Title page
         supersede notice will specify that the RAC applies to both the current and
         immediately subsequent TO Changes. If an in-work Change modifies affected
         pages or paragraphs, a second RAC may have to be issued concurrently with the
         in-work update. Urgent RACs will be formatted for and issued concurrently with
         the in-work Change.
     2.7.2.3. The TCM, TO Manager or editorial/production activity responsible for
     formatting the change obtains the digital baseline TO pages affected by the RAC
     (including title, LEP, data pages and corresponding backing pages), and converts them
     (if required) into a changeable digital format:
         2.7.2.3.1. For Indexed PDF (IPDF) format TOs (changeable source file not
         available):
            2.7.2.3.1.1. Download a copy of the baseline IPDF TO file from the DLDSS or

            2.7.2.3.1.2. Copy and paste text from baseline IPDF TO pages affected by the
36                                                    AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


            RAC to a ―change file‖ using a changeable format (e.g., Standard Generalized
            Markup Language [SGML]-tagged, ATOS, Microsoft® Word©, WordPerfect®,
            etc.)
        2.7.2.3.2. For TO files available in changeable (native) format:
            2.7.2.3.2.1. Download the baseline native format TO file to a PC.
            2.7.2.3.2.2. Copy and paste pages affected by the RAC from the baseline file to a
            ―change file.‖
        2.7.2.3.3. For Paper/Negative-only TO Masters:
            2.7.2.3.3.1. Obtain negative or paper masters of pages affected by the change.
            2.7.2.3.3.2. Convert the content of the pages affected by the RAC to a
            changeable file by electronically scanning the page using Optical Character
            Recognition (OCR) software, or by retyping the page if necessary.
        2.7.2.3.4. Make necessary changes to affected pages according to the approved
        Recommended Change. Title page and LEP format may vary slightly from the current
        specification or parent TO file format (e.g., column alignment, font size, dot leaders,
        graphic lines, etc.). The title page supersede notice must identify the change as an
        EMERGENCY or URGENT RAC and, when necessary, indicate which basic date is
        affected and which change(s) is superseded.
        2.7.2.3.5. Smaller font (9-point minimum) may be used on RAC data pages to
        accommodate added information on the affected and/or backing pages without
        impacting subsequent pages. If page integrity cannot be maintained (e.g., if the new
        information cannot feasibly be incorporated on the affected pages), then additional
        pages should be added as required according to current procedure. Color pages may
        be rendered in ―gray scale‖ (black and white). Foldouts to update paper TO copies
        will be managed on the receiving end by either shrinking them to fit an 11 x 17 page
        (maximum size most printers and copiers will handle), or printing and copying only
        the affected section of the foldout and overlaying the section on the original. All
        deviations will be returned to the parent TO format at the next routine update.
        2.7.2.3.6. The TCM and TO Manager review and approve the RAC.
     2.7.2.4. Convert the RAC file (Title page, LEP, changed pages and backing pages) to
     PDF using Adobe® Acrobat Exchange™ or selecting Print when the Acrobat PDF
     Writer driver is installed on the PC used to prepare the changeable format RAC file.
     OPTION: Use other Page Description Language (PDL) software to convert RAC files to
     an insert file compatible with baseline TO files not maintained in IPDF.
     2.7.2.5. The TCM, TO Manager or editor electronically merges the PDF RAC file with
     the IPDF baseline TO file to create a new baseline TO, and relinks (indexes) the new
     file using Acrobat Exchange and Info-Linker software. The merged and re-indexed
     IPDF TO is returned to digital storage as the new baseline digital TO file, along with
     the stand-alone PDF RAC file. If applicable, both files are uploaded to an Internet web
     server to replace the previous version TO file provided via WWW, thereby providing
     access to the digital baseline TO file and RAC. OPTION: Merge and upload files in
     another PDL when required for non-IPDF TO files.
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                    37


2.8. TO Printing/Reprinting.
   2.8.1. General. TO Managers arrange for reproduction and reprinting of TO stocks
   through DAPS (DODD 5330.3/AF Sup 1, Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS)).
   DAPS is the consolidated organization for printing and high-speed, high volume
   duplicating and is the preferred provider of document conversion and automation services
   within the Department of Defense. DAPS acquires traditional (offset) printing services
   through contracts that are awarded and administered by the Government Printing Office
   (GPO). By public law, any print order for over 25,000 units (# of single-sided 8½x11 pages
   multiplied by # of copies) must be printed by a GPO approved printer. Smaller print
   orders may be accomplished through other resources, such as prime or overflow contractors.
      2.8.1.1. An MOA between the TO Manager and DAPS may allow for the DAPS office to
      acquire a direct interface with a selected GPO printer when more cost effective.
      Original equipment or overflow contractors may perform some PTO printing; see TO 00-
      5-3 for limitations.
      2.8.1.2. The TO Manager determines PTO printing quantities according to TO 00-5-3,
      and the TO/Distribution Manager determines formal TO printing quantities according to
      paragraph 2.14 in this manual.
      2.8.1.3. As the numbers of complete digital TO masters grows, there will be
      increasing use of Just-In-Time (JIT) printing and distribution and Print-On-Demand
      (POD) production. These processes can eventually reduce or eliminate TO warehouses.
   2.8.2. Notification and Confirmation. The TO Manager will reprint TOs when the stock
   balance goes below the ―Reorder Pt. Qty.‖ previously established (does not apply to TOs
   using POD). The JCALS System forwards a ―Reorder Notification‖ message to the TO
   Manager JCALS In-Box as well as an e-mail notification to the TO Manager designated e-
   mail account.
      2.8.2.1. The TO Manager will request the warehouse to accomplish a physical
      inventory and report the exact stock status. The TO Manager updates the JCALS TO
      stock balance if required, using the JCALS ―Manage Inventory; Adjust TM Stock Item
      Quantity‖ function.
      2.8.2.2. TO Managers will use the JCALS TO Stock Management level processes to
      adjust the reprint levels (paragraph 2.1.6) if required.
      2.8.2.3. The TO Manager may use JCALS to place a TO in a ―dormant‖ stock status (not
      requiring reprint) when a revision or rescission is pending. Reprinting may also have to
      be delayed due to lack of funds.
   2.8.3. Create Print Orders. A print order consists of information describing printing and
   distribution services required and specifying the fund cite. Print quantities and handling will
   be specified. The DD Form 843, Requisition for Printing and Binding Service is typically
   used, but the local DAPS office will specify which form they require. Also included in the
   print package will be the reproduction medium and AFTO IMTs 30, Reproduction
   Assembly Sheets. When the printing contractor will also ship the TOs, include a shipping
   label deck and an AFMC IMT 578, USAF Technical Order Initial Distribution
38                                                          AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


     Verification, to confirm that shipment was completed. Local electronic procedures may be
     used instead of the AFMC IMT 578.
     2.8.4. Reprinting Department of the Army (DA) Publications. When the Army TM
     manager cannot provide additional backup stock of joint-use DA publications, the affected
     TO Manager may have to reprint copies for AF use. When DA publication masters are not
     available, a printed copy of the publication is sent to DAPS for reproduction. Requests for
     printing and the reproduction assembly sheet will include the following instructions:
        - The DA publication number is printed on the title page only. The TO number is printed
        on the title page (below the DA TM number) and all other pages of the reprint.
        - Replace the heavy DA paper cover with a standard Air Force title and ―A‖ page. Do
        not reflect changes separately on the ―A‖ page since the reprint is considered a merged
        basic.
        - Enlarge text and illustrations, if possible, to fill the normal printing area of the
        standard Air Force page size.
        - Use standard Air Force TO binding, drilling, stapling, etc.
2.9. Reproducible Material Procedures.
     2.9.1. Reproducible Material Storage. The TO Manager stores, contracts for, or
     delegates storage of reproducible material (negatives, artwork, reproducible copy for TOs,
     tapes and disks) for assigned TOs, not required by contractors preparing TO updates. The
     TO Manager publishing a TCTO stores the reproducible material. Digital reproducible
     master files will be stored by prime contractors or in an approved Air Force repository.
     Digital Change files will be merged with the TO master file. For hard-copy reproducible
     masters:
        2.9.1.1. The TO Manager maintains a locator file (JCALS/ETIMS, database or AFMC
        IMT 407, Technical Order Reproducible Material Record).
        2.9.1.2. Reproducible material will be checked for completeness when returned for
        storage, and the return date will be entered in the locator file.
        2.9.1.3. Locator files are reviewed every 2 months and follow-up action taken on
        reproducible material on loan for more than 50 days.
     2.9.2. Posting Changes. When new reproducible material for a TO change is received,
     insert (post) the changed material into the basic TO reproducible master. The replaced
     material is removed from the file and archived according to the Air Force Records
     Disposition Schedule (https://webrims.amc.af.mil/rds/index.cfm) (formerly AFMAN
     37-139).
     2.9.3. Requesting Reproducible Materiel. Administrative Contracting Officers (ACOs),
     TO Managers, and other DoD departments may request reproducible copy IAW TO 00-5-1,
     AFJI 21-301, and interservice agreements. A letter of transmittal is filed as a shipment record.
     Classified material is handled according to DOD 5200.1-R.
     2.9.4. Rescinded TO Reproducible Material. The TO Manager, delegated storage
     warehouse or contractor storing the material takes the following actions when notified
     that a TO or TCTO is rescinded:
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                  39


      2.9.4.1. Retain reproducible material for completely rescinded TOs (not required by
      Air Force, FMS or other DoD departments) for a period of 2 years. Retain TCTO
      reproducible materials for 6 months after rescission. Dispose of unclassified reproducible
      material IAW TO 00-5-1; dispose of classified reproducible material according to DOD
      5200.1-R/AFI 31-401.
      2.9.4.2. If a TO is rescinded for Air Force but retained for FMS or other DoD
      departments, retain material required for FMS TOs or transfer the reproducible material
      to the other DoD department still using the TO. Other DoD departments may request
      rescinded TO reproducible material according to AFJI 21-301. If available, the material
      will be transferred (not loaned) to them.
2.10. Post-Publication Reviews. Perform post-publication reviews to evaluate and improve
formal TOs after delivery to the using command. There are two types of post-publication
reviews: command reviews and currency reviews.
   2.10.1. Command Reviews. Hold command reviews according to TO                        00-5-3.
   Participants include the TO Manager, TCM, and using command representatives.
   2.10.2. Currency Reviews. The responsible TCM will:
      2.10.2.1. Review unclassified TOs that have not been updated for five years for
      currency.
      2.10.2.2. Review classified TOs at every update, but no less than annually, for currency
      and possible reclassification (see paragraph 1.4).
2.11. TO Rescissions. NOTE: TOs and increments replaced by or combined into new TOs and
TO updates will be superseded, not rescinded.
   2.11.1. TCM Procedures. The TCM will perform the following actions before
   recommending rescission of a TO without replacement, whether the need for rescission is
   identified through field inputs or through a periodic post-publication review (TCTO
   rescission is covered in Chapter 4):
      2.11.1.1. Identify all affected users of the TO by requesting an ID report from the TO
      Manager.
      2.11.1.2. Advise all affected managers (PMs, SAP/FMS, etc.) of the proposed
      rescission. If the TO is joint-service, follow AFJI 21-301 procedures to notify other DoD
      activities. Ensure the notification includes, as a minimum, known operational
      systems, commodities and related TOs involved. Include the part number, type, model
      and series of items to which the TO proposed for rescission applies, and include
      information on any replacing data.
      2.11.1.3. Ensure the system or commodities affected have been removed from
      operation and phased out of the inventory by checking the Standard Reporting
      Designator (SRD) through REMIS.
      2.11.1.4. Route rescission requests on published TOs through JCALS to the responsible
      TO Manager for action.
40                                                        AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


     2.11.2. TO Manager Procedures. If the rescission request is approved, the TO Manager
     will use the JCALS ―Manage TM Numbering, Rescind a TM‖ function to rescind the TO
     and update the JCALS Pub Index. The TO record remains in JCALS.
        2.11.2.1. If the TO will be rescinded for USAF but retained for FMS support, ensure
        that warehouse stocks are retained.
        2.11.2.2. If the TO is rescinded for both USAF and FMS, dispose of warehouse stocks,
        retaining only archive copies.
     2.11.3. Nuclear Weapons TOs. Send rescission requests for nuclear TOs to the NW
     Logistics Division, AAC/NWLT, Kirtland AFB NM.
2.12. Reinstatement of TOs. The TO Manager reinstates TOs using the JCALS ―Reinstate a
Rescinded TM‖ and ―Update TM Index‖ screens according to the JCALS DI.
2.13. Requisitions Using AFTO IMT 276, Special Requisition for Air Force Technical
Order.
     2.13.1. Warehouse ―Walk-Through‖ Requisitions. ALC personnel may use the AFTO
     IMT 276 to make walk-through requisitions of TOs from the warehouse. Complete the
     form as outlined in TO 00-5-1, except for block 1 which will contain only the TO number.
     Adjust stock inventory levels in JCALS using the ―Adjust TM Stock Item Quantities‖
     screen.
     2.13.2. FMS Customer Use. AFMC personnel must ensure that AFTO IMT 276
     requisitions are coordinated through the appropriate local Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO)
     before the TOs are issued to FMS customers. Bypassing the releasability process could
     result in foreign customers receiving TOs which may not be releasable to them.
2.14. Printing Quantity and Shipping Label Procedures. JCALS currently requires a four-
step process to successfully generate labels:
     2.14.1. Determine Print Quantities. The TO/Distribution Manager sets total printing
     quantity for TOs, except TCTOs, by adding the computed backup stock quantity to the ID
     quantity (backup stock is not applicable for JIT/POD printing).
        2.14.1.1. ID Quantities. The TO/Distribution Manager uses the ―Manage Initial
        Distribution for a TM; Generate ID Report by Publication‖ function to determine ID
        requirements on record in JCALS. The manager then reviews the report, and adjusts
        the quantities to include organizations scheduled to be activated, but presently having no
        requirement set up.
        2.14.1.2. Requirements for Additional ID Addressees. When a TO or TCTO must be
        distributed before all subscription requirements can be submitted in response to a TO
        index listing, coordinate with using MAJCOMs to determine if additional distribution is
        required. Add additional activities identified by the MAJCOM, using the JCALS
        ―Specify ID by Like Item‖ function to develop the Initial Distribution list based upon ID
        requirements for a similar TO.
            2.14.1.2.1. The TO or TCTO series whose ID requirements are being used must be
            the same or higher classification than the TO or TCTO to be distributed. The ID label
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                               41


       will include only the TO or TCTO number being distributed. Subsequent label
       requests must use the proper TO number or TCTO series from the TO index.
       2.14.1.2.2. ID by Like Item must not be made to SAP/FMS customers (D*xxxx TM
       Account codes). JCALS will not include labels for SAP/FMS TODOs in the ID by
       Like Item/Account Profile decks, even if the source TO included SAP/FMS
       distribution. The TO/Distribution Manager must notify the SATODS office (OC-
       ALC/LGLUF) that a new TO/TCTO with possible FMS requirements is being
       distributed.
       2.14.1.2.3. TOs and TO increments distributed with missing or misprinted pages
       may be corrected by redistributing the missing/reprinted pages using an ―Errata
       Cover Sheet‖ and the JCALS ―Specify ID by Like Item‖ or ―Specify ID by Account
       Profile‖ processes to develop a distribution label deck. The Errata Cover Sheet (see
       Glossary) will provide instructions to insert/replace the pages into the affected TOs.
       This method will not be used to replace pages when the content of the data must
       be changed. Print or overstamp the words "MISSING PAGES" in block 27 of
       the DD Form 1348-2, Issue Release/Receipt Document With Address Label.
       Because errata packages do not change TO data or change numbers, the packages are
       not numbered and indexed in JCALS. Send sufficient copies of the package to the TO
       warehouse to update any backup stock.
       2.14.1.2.4. Like Item Distribution cannot be used for errata packages sent to
       SAP/FMS customers, for releasability and billing reasons. Contact the SATOP office
       (OC-ALC/LGLUF) for assistance in redistributing the missing/reprinted pages to
       FMS users. LGLUF will work these requirements internally.
       2.14.1.2.5. Backup Stock Quantities. The TO/Distribution Manager establishes
       backup stock printing requirements for use in filling anticipated requisitions (N/A
       for JIT/POD TOs). In computing printing requirements, the manager considers the
       life expectancy of the TO based on type, programmed use, and any established
       change or revision cycle. The manager also evaluates consumption rates using
       similar TO histories or a previous issue of the same TO, and accounts for present and
       planned programming of the weapon or space system equipment, or material to
       which the TO applies.
       2.14.1.2.6. TO Change Quantities. The total printing quantity for a TO change is
       computed by adding the number of copies needed to update TO stock on hand to the
       ID quantity, plus the number of copies needed to fill requisitions from TODOs who
       failed to receive supplements or changes distributed under normal system operation.
       When a TO change will be incorporated into a revision within 90 days, backup stock
       is reduced accordingly.
       2.14.1.2.7. TCTO Quantities. Total printing quantity for TCTOs is computed by
       adding the computed backup stock quantity and any additional specific requirements
       for copies to the ID quantity. Enough TCTO stock should be printed to cover
       anticipated FMS TCTO distribution requirements.
42                                                         AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


     2.14.2. Generate ID Labels.
        2.14.2.1. Receive Due-In Quantity. The TO/Distribution Manager will use ―Manage
        Inventory; Create Due-In Receipt‖ to complete the stocking process. The total quantity
        computed above is the print quantity provided with the print order to DAPS. When the
        manager is notified that stock is available at the warehouse or when DAPS will also
        distribute printed TOs, the quantity received or that will be included in the print order
        will be entered into JCALS using the ―Manage Inventory; Create Due-In‖ screen. Once
        stock has been entered into JCALS, ID or RQN labels may be generated.
        2.14.2.2. The TO/Distribution Manager requests shipping labels using the JCALS
        ―Manage Warehouse; Create Pick Ticket for Initial Distribution‖ TM Process. (Pick
        Tickets are identical to the DD Form 1348-2 Shipping Labels.) Using ―Pick Ticket‖
        clears the Label file for the next increment. If the TO Manager believes there will be a
        need for immediate re-issue of the ID label deck (such as for distributing errata sheets),
        use the ―Create File with Ship Label for ID‖ which does NOT clear the label file.
        JCALS then produces labels for mailing the reproduced publications. NOTE: The ID
        Ship Date entered into the ID Pick Ticket screen will be automatically copied to the
        Estimated Distribution Date (EDD) field of the TM Index record. Users will know when
        Initial Distribution is estimated to be complete because this information is available
        through the Air Force TO Catalog.
        2.14.2.3. Establish controls to ensure decks of ID labels will arrive at the printers before
        completion of printing, when contract printer will make the distribution. Routine label
        generation should be done within 10 days of submitting the TO print package to the
        printer. Labels will expire 58 to 60 days from the date the label was prepared. ID decks
        sent directly to a separate government or contractor activity are authorization for them to
        distribute the TOs.
     2.14.3. Generate Labels for One Time Requisition. TO Managers will routinely check
     JCALS Stock Points to determine how many requisitions are pending for available stock.
     Run ―Back Order Reports‖ on TO numbers ordered frequently.
        2.14.3.1. As with the ID process described previously, the manager must ensure adequate
        stock is available to prevent requisitions from being backordered. When reprint stock is
        received, the manager will use the JCALS ―Manage Inventory; Adjust TM Stock Item
        Quantities‖ screen to record the quantity of TO stock received and available.
        2.14.3.2. Managers will use the JCALS ―Manage Warehouse; Create File with Pick
        Ticket (Shipping Label) for One Time Requisition‖ process to generate RQN labels/files
        in accordance with the JCALS DI. The file will include RQN shipping labels for
        requisition transactions listed for each of the JCALS Stock Point Organization
        Identifiers (Org ID).
        2.14.3.3. If stock is not available in JCALS, requisitions will be backordered. Once
        Stock is received and entered into JCALS, backordered transactions will be released
        to the appropriate stock point.
        2.14.3.4. Setting stock levels to fictitious levels in support of POD processing must be
        carefully managed. Requisitions will build in the stock point since the JCALS system
        has determined that stock is available. Transactions status of ―BA – Shipped‖ is returned
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                     43


       to the users when the Requisition transaction is listed in the Stock Point. For this reason,
       funding must be sufficient to support POD process to prevent requisitions from being in
       BA – Shipped status for extended periods of time. BA status only indicates that stock is
       available to ship.
   2.14.4. Shipping/Distribution Records. An AFMC IMT 578 or letter directing
   confirmation of distribution and date dispatched will be sent to printing contractors with the
   ID deck. When ID will be made in-house, an AFMC IMT 145, TO Receiving/Processing
   Record, is sent to the responsible TO warehouse along with the ID deck. When the
   completed forms are returned, the TO Manager must update the Estimated Distribution
   Date (EDD) in JCALS with the date ID shipment was completed. Retain the returned
   AFMC IMT 145, 578 or letter confirming TO distribution until the TO or change is replaced
   or rescinded.
2.15. TO Warehouses. TO warehouses are normally located at ALCs, but the functions may
be carried out by contractors or individual Program Manager (PM) organizations at other
locations. Warehouses perform the stock, store and issue functions of the TO system for the local
PMs.
2.16. Official Air Force TO Archives (Repository).
   2.16.1. Business Practice. At least one copy of every TO and TCTO basic, revision, change
   and supplement must be preserved in the Air Force Official TO Archive to comply with
   record retention provisions of the Federal Records Act and to ensure preservation for Air
   Force needs. TOs are held for 6 years after they are rescinded, contracts are closed and the
   supported equipment is dropped from AF inventory (Air Force Records Disposition
   Schedule, https://webrims.amc.af.mil/rds/index.cfm). When there are both digital and
   paper copies, only the digital version will be archived.
       2.16.1.1. OC-ALC/LGLUB is the custodian of the Air Force Official TO Archive
       Library. LGLUB Archive personnel will compare issue data on the TOs and updates
       submitted for filing. A location number will be assigned to the correct and complete
       JCALS TM record. When discrepancies occur, Archive personnel will notify TO
       management personnel to update JCALS TM index screens with necessary corrective
       action.
       2.16.1.2. Reproduced copies of inactive TOs required to perform assigned duties are
       obtained from OC-ALC/LGLUB according to TO 00-5-1 and procedures in paragraph
       2.17 below.
   2.16.2. Rescinded TOs List. The responsible TO Manager generates and reviews the
   JCALS ―Manage Repository, Review Rescinded TM List,‖ and uses the ―Specify
   Whether to Keep or Dispose Rescinded TM‖ window to identify any TOs on systems
   rescinded for over 6 years. Verify there are no further Air Force obligations to other users
   (Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, SAP countries, FMS customers, etc.) to determine
   if there is a continuing need to retain the archive copy of any TOs identified.
       2.16.2.1. The reviewer also coordinates with the local office of the Judge Advocate
       and HQ USAF/JACL/JACP to ensure there are no unsettled claims by or against the
       US Government, incomplete investigations, litigations, or other actions involving the
       rescinded TO.
44                                                       AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


        2.16.2.2. The TO Manager uses the JCALS ―Specify Whether to Keep or Dispose
        Rescinded TM‖ and ―Confirm Removal of Repository Publications Marked for
        Disposal‖ screens to specify whether to retain or dispose of archived copies of
        individual TOs.
     2.16.3. Transfer to the USAF Museum. Semiannually, OC-ALC/LGLUB sends the list
     of TOs to be deleted from the Archives to the US Air Force Museum, Wright-Patterson
     AFB OH, to offer the TOs for possible inclusion in the museum historical collection.
     LGLUB must obtain written permission from the data source to release TOs for museum
     use if proprietary data is involved, IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
     (https://webrims.amc.af.mil/rds/index.cfm). Any conditions imposed by the contractor
     will be stipulated in the transfer agreement. Upon receipt of the list of requested TOs,
     LGLUB forwards them to the museum and disposes the remaining TOs.
2.17. Servicing Requests for Inactive TOs. TCMs, in coordination with TO Managers,
determine the releasability of inactive TOs according to DOD 5200.1-R, DODD 5230.24,
DODD 5230.25, DOD 5400.7-R/AF Sup, AFI 61-204, TO 00-5-1, and other applicable
directives. Requests for inactive TOs are sent to the responsible PM for review, and forwarded to
OC-ALC/LGLUB after approval.
     2.17.1. Approving Officials. Requests must be signed by the person(s) authorized to
     make emergency requests. Each PM furnishes a list of authorized approving officials to OC-
     ALC/LGLUB annually. LGLUB cannot accept requests for inactive TOs directly from other
     requesters.
     2.17.2. Screening Requests. The PM review includes screening requests for inactive TOs
     against the JCALS TM Index to ensure that a requested TO is in fact inactive (requests for
     active TOs must be filled from stock), and using the JCALS ―Manage Repository;
     Repository Status Report‖ TM process to determine if the requested TO is available in the
     Archives or has been purged.
2.18. Transfer of TO Management Responsibility.
     2.18.1. Business Practices. Responsibility for TO program and content management
     usually transfers to the new PM (JCALS Proponent) if the system or equipment covered by
     the TOs is transferred. Both losing and gaining proponents must agree on the transfer and
     schedules before any actions can occur. Transfer should include all TOs and all TO family
     increments in the affected TO series; i.e. all related basics, changes, supplements, TCTOs
     and TCTO series headers. The gaining TO Manager coordinates with the gaining TO
     warehouse function to resolve possible impacts. The losing TO Manager must coordinate
     proposed transfers to non-AFMC activities with HQ AFMC/LGYE before taking any action.
     NOTE: Transfer schedules will be dependent on the monthly cut-off date for submission
     of proponent changes to the JCALS System Operations Support Center (SOSC, operated
     by the Computer Sciences Corporation). Contact AFMC/LGYE for further information and
     guidance.
     2.18.2. Gaining Organization Procedures. The gaining organization, if not already
     established as a JCALS proponent, will complete the Establish TM Proponent Checklist
     (Figure 2.2) to ensure that all required JCALS system support actions have been
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                  45


  accomplished prior to requesting the database changes. The gaining site JCALS POC shall
  ensure completion of the checklist if required.
  2.18.3. Losing Organization Procedures. The losing TO Manager identifies any Work In
  Progress (WIP) involving the TOs to be transferred, and makes all efforts to close out WIP
  prior to proponent transfer actions. Examples of WIP are open recommended changes
  (JCALS workflow jobs), open reproduction order workflows, etc. Minimizing WIP shall be
  used as one of the factors used in determining the transfer schedule. WIP that cannot be
  closed out shall be reported to the SOSC and the gaining TO Manager by the losing TO
  Manager. The SOSC will report the technical impacts of transferring TOs with open WIP.
  The losing TO Manager provides an Excel spreadsheet to the local JCALS site POC
  listing the TO Numbers and existing JCALS Proponent ID, Controlling Organization
  (Inventory Control Point – ICP), Stock Point, JCALS identification (―userid‖) of the TO
  Manager, ES and Stock Point Manager for each TO.
  2.18.4. Identify Gaining POCs. The gaining TO Manager provides an Excel spreadsheet to
  the local JCALS site POC listing the TO Numbers and new JCALS Proponent ID,
  Controlling Organization (Inventory Control Point – ICP), Stock Point (Warehouse), and
  JCALS identification (―userid‖) of the new TO Manager, ES and Stock Point Manager for
  each TO.
  2.18.5. JCALS POC Procedures. The HQ AFMC/LG Proponent Transfer POC will
  consolidate proponent changes and forward all spreadsheets to the SOSC by the
  monthly cut-off date. The monthly cut-off allows time to update the JCALS TO Index and
  SATODS interface files to reflect the database changes needed in time for update of the data
  in JCALS on the first of the following month. The SOSC shall determine technical impacts
  due to Proponent ID/database changes, if any, on any of the various interface files.
  2.18.6. Warehouse Coordination. If the gaining proponent is at a different site, the TO
  warehouse servicing the losing proponent will ensure that the JCALS requisition buffer for
  the appropriate stock point is empty prior to the database changes being accomplished. If not
  done, requisitions in the buffer will transfer to the gaining proponent/stock point, where the
  physical stock does not yet exist.
  2.18.7. SOSC Actions. The SOSC will delete the appropriate records in the Global Data
  Management System (GDMS) database at the losing site, and add them to the GDMS
  database at the gaining site. The process of changing the data and the resulting checks and
  validations will take approximately a week. Upon completion, the SOSC shall notify the HQ
  AFMC/LG POC, who will notify both the gaining and losing sites that the databases have
  been updated. The gaining TO Manager will check a random sampling of TO numbers
  and/or execute system reports to validate that the database changes have been made.
  2.18.8. Stock Transfer. For physical stock transfer, the GDMS database changes should
  be made before any stock is moved, to prevent new requisitions from going to the losing
  TO warehouse after the physical stock has already left.
     2.18.8.1. The gaining TO Manager will provide the shipping address for stock
     (generally the address of the TO warehouse servicing the gaining proponent location) to
     the losing warehouse, and pass the list of TO Numbers to the gaining warehouse with
46                                                        AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


        instructions to hold requisitions (DD Forms 1348-2) for the new TOs until receipt from
        the losing warehouse.
        2.18.8.2. The losing TO Manager will pass the list of TO Numbers to the TO
        warehouse, and monitor actions to ensure stock is packaged and shipped according to the
        transfer schedule.
        2.18.8.3. The gaining TO warehouse performs a 100% inventory of the TOs upon
        receipt, and adjusts stock balances via the JCALS ―Adjust TM Stock Quantities‖ screen.
        Upon completion of the inventory, held DD Forms 1348-2 will be released.
2.19. TO Stock Disposal Actions. TO/Distribution Managers will:
     2.19.1. Request the warehouse to destroy incomplete sets of basic TOs, TOPS,
     supplements and changes according to TO 00-5-1 when complete reprints are received.
     2.19.2. Use the JCALS ―Manage TM Index; Update an Index Entry‖ process to supersede a
     TO, TO supplement or TCTO for Air Force and FMS. Use JCALS ―Manage TM
     Numbering; Rescind a TM‖ to rescind a TO, TO Supplement or TCTO. Notify the
     warehouse to dispose of existing stocks of the TO/TCTO and associated increments when a
     TO or TCTO is superseded or rescinded for Air Force and FMS. Direct the warehouse to
     dispose of supplements only when superseded by incorporation into a TO change. The
     deleted TO version/increment records will remain in JCALS until archived by the TO
     Manager.
     2.19.3. Notify other service users in accordance with AFJI 21-301 when the Air Force
     decides to rescind a joint-use publication for which AF is the cognizant activity.
     Remaining stock will be disposed of according to the previous paragraph.
2.20. TO Management Practices Using JCALS. The TO Manager makes changes to
management data about a TO using the appropriate JCALS screens when the correction,
addition, or deletion of TO management data elements is required. Use the screen
completion procedures described in the DI under JCALS TM Processes for further
information.
     2.20.1. System or Equipment Data Related to TO Acquisition (TO 00-5-3). The TO
     Manager or TCM uses the ―Perform Acquisition; Updating an Acquisition‖ screens to
     input or update Weapon Systems, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes and
     item part numbers. Other Acquisition sub-types are used to establish acquisition programs,
     develop Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs) and other related documentation, issue
     Data Calls, and develop TO pricing data. TO budgets, TO cost elements and Engineering
     Change Proposal (ECP) costs are managed through the ―Manage Program Support‖ sub-type
     screens. Various sub-types of the ―Manage Quality Assurance‖ type are used to schedule
     and control In-Process Reviews (IPRs), Validation, Verification, and other QA type
     functions.
     2.20.2. Establishing Sponsor Approval (paragraph 2.1.8.). If a TO Manager desires to
     review all initial subscription and requisition transactions before they may be processed, the
     Sponsor Approval flag must be set in the record for the Basic TO increment. All subsequent
     TO increments established will inherit this Sponsor Approval flag setting. If the Sponsor
     Approval requirement will be changed for a TO, the JCALS Update TM Index Publication
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                47


  Stock Number (PSN) screen must be used to make the change for all currently active and
  available TO increments.
  2.20.3. Processing ID subscription or Requisition Transactions for TOs Requiring
  Sponsor Approval. TO Managers will receive notification of a TO request requiring
  sponsor approval through the JCALS To Do List. When the - work folder containing the
  request is opened, the TO Manager will ―Open‖ and ―Edit‖ the folder (which opens the
  ―Order Publication‖ screen), review the information, verify that justification has been
  received (if required), and approve or disapprove the request.
  2.20.4. Completing Recommended Change (RC–Chapter 3) Evaluation. TO
  M a n a g e r s a n d TCMs will review and evaluate RCs using the JCALS ―Improve TM;
  View a Recommended TM Change‖ screens. Once the RC is opened and the review is
  complete, go to the ―Status‖ screen and select the appropriate status (approved, abeyance,
  etc.). Then go to the ―Disposition‖ screen and enter any pertinent comments (changes to RC
  wording, RC type, benefits, etc.) Then go to the ―Options‖ menu and select ―Submit.‖
  Ensure off-line JCALS submitters and reviewers are notified of any RC status changes.
  2.20.5. TO Numbering (paragraph 2.2). TO Managers will request TO numbers using the
  JCALS ―Manage TO Numbering; Assign a Publication Number‖ process. Only OC-
  ALC/LGLUB personnel (and AFMETCAL personnel for calibration TOs) are authorized to
  have the JCALS system privilege necessary to assign/approve basic TO and TCTO Series
  Header numbers. OC-ALC/ LGLUB will determine which TO numbers are appropriate
  using TO 00-5-18 and other standards. NOTE: Neither nuclear weapons nor EOD TOs are
  managed in JCALS. Numbering will be managed by AAC/NWLT and Det 63 AAC/WMO,
  respectively.
  2.20.6. Manage TM Index (paragraph 2.2). The TO Manager uses the JCALS ―Update
  an Index Entry‖ screens, using DI procedures, for changing the TO title, system application,
  management data, issue data, security classification, joint service use, and PSN. These
  screens are also used to add (index) TO changes, revisions and supplements, and to mark
  superseded and rescinded TOs and increments. JCALS TM Index is extracted monthly
  according to the AFTOX Interface specification. TO Index data extracted from JCALS is
  presented in the web-based Air Force TO Catalog application. Errors in the accuracy or
  quality of TO Index data must be corrected in the JCALS TM index record.
  2.20.7. Preparing and Submitting Reproduction Packages (paragraph 2.8). The TO
  Manager will prepare and submit reproduction packages using the JCALS ―Reproduce TM;
  Prepare a Reproduction Package, Develop a Reproduction Order‖ screen to initiate the
  reproduction process. The normal process is ―prepare,‖ ―approve,‖ ―create DD Form 282,
  DoD Printing Requisition/Order,‖ ―send to DAPS for cost estimate,‖ ―approve cost
  estimate,‖ and ―complete the order.‖ The TO files are placed in the Reproduction Order -
  Work folder, and submitted to DAPS. Other sub-processes allow the TO Manager to
  determine reproduction quantities and media, and specify shipping instructions. NOTE: If
  DAPS is not on JCALS, Repro Order - work folders may have to be submitted via e-mail
  or FTP.
  2.20.8. Managing Due-Ins and Shipping Labels (paragraph 2.14). TO Managers use the
  JCALS ―Manage Inventory‖ process to create, change quantities, and receive projected
  TO stock into the warehouse. Due-Ins must be created before Shipping Labels can be
48                                                       AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


     requested. To generate labels for ID, use the JCALS ―Manage Warehouse; Create File with
     Pick Tickets for Initial Distribution‖ process. To generate labels for one-time requisitions
     (including increases in subscription quantities by individual TODO TM accounts), use the
     JCALS ―Manage Warehouse; Create File with Pick Tickets for One Time Requisition‖
     process. In both cases, selecting ―Pick Tickets‖ rather than ―Shipping Labels‖ will save
     print time and materials.
     2.20.9. Stock Control and the TO Archives (paragraph 2.16). The TO Manager will
     use the JCALS processes under ―Manage Inventory; Adjust TM Stock Item Quantities‖ to
     adjust warehouse stock quantities. Use the ―Manage TM Index; Update TM Index‖ screen
     to toggle the dormant issue status of TO stocks. OC-ALC/LGLUB will use the JCALS
     ―Manage Repository‖ functions to add Archive locations and assign, change and checkout
     TOs to/from those locations. TO Managers will use the sub-type ―Review Rescinded TM
     List, Specify Whether to Keep or Dispose Rescinded TM‖ window to review and
     recommend disposal of TOs at the end of the required archive period.
     2.20.10. TCTO Rescission Review (paragraph 4.9). TCMs will use the JCALS
     ―Perform Post Publication Review‖ type and sub-type, and select the ―Time Compliant
     Pubs for Rescission‖ review type to generate a listing of assigned TCTOs approaching
     rescission dates. For those within 150 days of rescission, the TCM will evaluate whether to
     extend the rescission dates or to rescind the TOs early or on the specified dates.
     2.20.11. Reports. JCALS users can access numerous reports to assist with TO and
     TODO (TM) Account management. These reports are grouped into Inventory, TM Index,
     TM Improvement, Quality Assurance, Initial Distribution, One Time requisition and TM
     Account areas. Procedures for accessing the reports are in the JCALS DI.
     2.20.12. TODO (TM) Accounts. JCALS TM Account ship-to ad dress codes (or
     simply TM Accounts) are established during or after the JCALS System
     Administration establishes and/or approves the JCALS Org Identifier for the organization
     entity (TODO) where the TM Account will be (or is) established. Once the JCALS Org Id
     and TM Account ship-to address code is established, TODO personnel (JCALS users) will
     complete information for the TODO TM account profile using the TM Process ―Manage
     TM Accounts; Request a New TM Account.‖ There are three types of TM Accounts:
     Standard designation (F*xxxx) for government TODOs; Contractor (E*xxxx) for non-
     government contractor TODOs and FMS (D*xxxx) for SAP/FMS TM Accounts.

                    TO RECOMMENDED CHANGE PROCESSING

3.1. Forms and Corresponding JCALS/ETIMS Functions. All TO change recommendations
and submittal methods are known collectively as ―Recommended Changes (RCs).‖ The JCALS
―Recommend a TM Change‖ function provides system users the capability to document,
submit, review, evaluate and track processing of recommended TO changes (discrepancies or
improvements). The JCALS Desktop Instructions (DI) contains procedures for initiating and
submitting RCs using JCALS. Non-JCALS users will continue to use the AF IMT 847/AFTO
IMT 22/AFTO IMT 27 processes for submittal and review. When ETIMS becomes available,
the ETIMS Recommended Change function must be used to submit, review, evaluate and
provide status of proposed TO changes.
   3.1.1. JCALS Prepare TM Change Package Function. Approved RCs from all sources
   (including ETIMS) are aggregated by TO and used by the TCM to develop a TO update
   package that will document the exact wording of approved changes for publication in the
   TO update. The JCALS Prepare TM Change Package function or a digital AFMC IMT 252
   change package will be used until ETIMS subsumes the JCALS function.
   3.1.2. AFTO IMT 22 or JCALS ―Recommend a TM Change‖ Screens. TO 00-5-1
   contains practices and detailed instructions for initiating, reviewing and evaluating AFTO
   IMTs 22. Completed forms are submitted via e-mail and, if approved, a JCALS
   ―Recommend a TM Change‖ (RC) work folder is prepared by the TO Manager or TCM.
   3.1.3. AF IMT 847. AFI 11-215 contains policy and procedures for use of AF IMTs 847
   for submitting changes to Flight Manual Program (FMP) TOs. The JCALS ―Recommend a
   TM Change‖ process may also be used to recommend changes to flight manual TOs. AF
   IMTs 847 are not entered or tracked in JCALS.
   3.1.4. AFTO IMT 27, Preliminary Technical Order (PTO) Publication Change Request
   (PCR)/ TO Verification Record/Approval. TO 00-5-3 contains policy and procedures
   for use of AFTO IMTs 27 to report discrepancies or recommend improvements to
   Preliminary TOs. The forms are not entered or tracked in JCALS. The JCALS ―Recommend
   a TM Change‖ process will be used to submit proposed changes for preliminary TOs only if
   so directed by the TO Manager.
   3.1.5. Source, Maintenance and Recoverability (SMR) Code Change Request. The
   SMR Code Change Request form was developed and implemented to provide the
   maintenance technician with a means to recommend routine or priority changes to
   previously assigned SMR codes or to obtain a waiver from those codes. This form
   is located at the INFOCEN web page, https://www.asc.wpafb.af.mil/infocen/. Click
   on the SMR info button and this will take the user to the Document Routing Entry And Mail
   Submitter (DREAMS) SMR web page. This page provides the capability to access the SMR
   Code Change Request form, provides a DREAMS SMR user manual and other data needed
   to submit an electronic SMR Code Change Request. All TO users should be using
   DREAMS to submit their SMR Code changes. Changes can be recommended to any and
   all of the five positions of the SMR code. The form will not be used to request initial
   assignment of an SMR code – instead, submit an AFTO IMT 22 in accordance with TO
52                                                        AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


     00-5-1 and TO 00-20-3,. Maintenance Processing of Reparable Property and The Repair
     Cycle Asset Control System, Table 6-1. Once a recommendation for SMR code change is
     approved, the TCM will enter the relevant data into a JCALS ―Recommend a TM Change‖
     screen for updating the TO.
     3.1.6. AFMC IMT 202. Depot maintenance activities will use the AFMC IMT 202 to
     request and receive technical data for procedures and repairs beyond existing TO authority,
     according to Chapter 5 of this manual. AFMC IMTs 202 are not entered or tracked in
     JCALS. When the new technical data will be permanent, the data will be included in TOs
     through use of the JCALS ―Recommend a TM Change‖ process or a digital AFMC IMT
     252.
     3.1.7. AFMC IMT 252. The TO content manager (TCM, FMM, or TO Manager) may use
     a digital AFMC IMT 252 as an alternative to aggregating approved RCs in JCALS
     and to document word-for-word changes for the specified TO update.
     3.1.8. ETIMS Technical Order Recommended Change. ETIMS will provide a single
     screen format for electronic submission of proposed corrections and enhancements to both
     flight and non-flight manual TOs. Workflows will route the formats for review and
     evaluation IAW AFI 11-215 and TO 00-5-1 procedures.
3.2. Process Recommended TM Changes.
     3.2.1. General. This chapter provides procedures for processing of RCs received on any of
     the above forms or JCALS functions. The AFTO IMT 22 is used for illustration purposes, but
     similar procedures may be used with approved changes originally submitted on any of the
     above forms. Initiators will complete and submit digital forms via e-mail IAW TO 00-5-1, or
     enter recommended changes directly into a JCALS ―Recommend a TM Change‖ screen.
     RCs entered directly into JCALS are automatically routed to the TO Manager by the
     system.
        NOTE: Proposed changes to nuclear weapon TOs managed by AAC/NWLT or EOD
        TOs managed by the Naval EOD Technology Division are submitted only on AFTO
        IMTs 22 and not entered or tracked in JCALS at this time.
        NOTE: Exceptions to processing times are specified in paragraphs 3.2.2.1., 3.2.2.2.,
        3.2.6.1 and 3.2.6.2.
     3.2.2. TO Manager Procedures. Upon receipt, the TO Manager will process an RC within
     the time limits specified in Figure 3.1. The TO Manager will establish routine update
     schedules for all assigned TOs, depending upon data criticality and volatility, and which
     meet the Figure 3.1 time limits. Aggregate all routine RCs received after the cut-off date
     (publication freeze date) of the previous update and prior to the cut-off for the next update
     into a single update package for each TO. The action or response time periods for each RC
     begin with receipt of the RC by the responsible TO Manager. The periods end when an
     update is distributed or the RC is disapproved or determined to be a duplicate submission.
        3.2.2.1. Exceptions to Evaluation Time. Recommended Changes (RCs) placed in
        Abeyance, Advisement or Deferred status (TO 00-5-1) are exempt from the time limits
        specified in Figure 3.1.
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                   53


     3.2.2.2. SAP/FMS Procedures. The above policy does not apply to AFTO IMTs 22
     received from foreign countries under the Security Assistance Program (including FMS
     cases) when contractual arrangements (including FMS cases) have been made to
     maintain the currency of the respective TOs (TO 00-5-19).
     3.2.2.3. Enter the ―Date Received‖ at the top of the form. Ensure block 2 of AFTO
     IMTs 22 has the name and DSN of the initiating MAJCOM Command Control Point
     (CCP) Point of Contact (POC) entered, and is checked ―Approved.‖ (EXCEPTION: If
     the Initiating MAJCOM is the Lead Command, only block 3 is completed.) Also ensure
     RCs against weapon system TOs have entries in block 3 for the Lead Command
     CCP (unless the weapon system TOs have been exempted from Lead Command
     review by a TO 00-5-1 supplement). Return incomplete and disapproved RCs to the
     initiator. RCs initiated in JCALS are automatically routed by JCALS locally created
     workflow templates for base and command review before being submitted to the TO
     Manager.
     3.2.2.4. Evaluate RCs recommending publication style and format changes, minor
     typographical errors or new types of TOs, and forward RCs recommending TO technical
     content changes to the TCM for further evaluation in accordance with TO 00-5-1. Return
     a copy of all RCs to the initiator and reviewing agencies to provide status. The
     JCALS workflow manager (WFM) forwards JCALS RCs automatically.
     3.2.2.5. Disapprove RCs submitted on computer program or equipment deficiencies and
     refer the initiator to TO 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating
     System, for reporting non-TO deficiencies. Also, disapprove RCs determined to be
     ineligible in accordance with TO 00-5-1, Chapter 9 (section on TO Change
     Procedures), including multiple RCs submitted to correct a single deficiency.
     3.2.2.6. Input approved RCs into JCALS by importing (saving) the digital RC file and
     any attachment files into JCALS as part of the recommended change work folder. TO
     Managers will transcribe mandatory information for approved RCs from the
     above forms into a JCALS ―Recommend a TM Change‖ screen, and include digital
     copies of the saved forms and any attachments (if applicable) into the resulting JCALS -
     work folder. Complete the following mandatory fields in the ―Recommend A TM
     Change‖ screen:
        - Local Control No. Field: Enter the Local Control Number from AFTO 22 block 5,
        or equivalent control numbers from other forms, or for internally prepared RCs,
        develop a number according to paragraph 3.2.5.1.
        - Select the correct priority level.
        - Use the publication no. chooser button to select the affected TO. NOTE: The
        affected TO must have a corresponding JCALS TM Index record.
        - Enter information into at least two of the following fields: page no., paragraph no.,
        figure no., table no., function no., and/or line/item/step no. fields.
        - Briefly describe the discrepancy in the SHORT DESCRIPTION OF
        DEFICIENCY field. The information entered in this field will be used to assist with
        identifying the RC, so be as descriptive as possible.
        - Either reference the source AFTO 22 files in the deficiency field, or enter a complete
        description of the discrepancy, and identify the military system or commodity when
54                                                      AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


           not included in the TO number. Identify commodities by Model/Design/Series
           (MDS) or Type/Model/Series (TMS) and NSN or part number. Omit for general
           and MPTOs. Include the RC Type (―correction‖ or ―improvement‖ – AFTO 22
           block 7).
           - Either reference the source AFTO 22 files in the recommended TM change field, or
           complete in accordance with instructions for the AFTO IMT 22, block 20 (TO 00-5-
           1, Chapter 9). Include the estimated savings (blocks 21 & 22), and Innovative
           Development through Employee Awareness (IDEA) program benefits and amount
           (block 28). Include IDEA benefits justification in the RC - work folder.
           - Select the ―Save‖ option to save the RC to the - Work folder (record the name and
           JCALS control number for future reference). Use the JCALS ―- Work folder
           Manager‖ function to import the digital AFTO IMT 22 (or other RC form) file and
           any attachment files into the RC -.
        3.2.2.7. Ensure the TCM has entered ITOs containing permanent TO changes into
        JCALS RC screens.
        3.2.2.8. Determine the copy freeze date for each assigned TO. Aggregate applicable
        approved RCs into a JCALS TM Change Package, and submit the completed TO package
        in a - for publication according to the DI. A local workflow will route packages to the
        appropriate in-house or contract editorial and publishing function. Use the AFMC IMT
        252 as an alternative to JCALS in the event that JCALS is not available to the TO
        Manager, TCM or editorial and publishing function.
        3.2.2.9. Provide any special instructions in the change package work folder (e.g., the
        list of TO increments to be listed in the title page supersede notice). When ―Special
        Handling‖ AFMC IMTs 252 or RCs (SH252/SHRC) and AFMC IMTs 202
        (Chapter 5) are incorporated, include the applicable project numbers in the supersede
        notice.
     3.2.3. TCM RC Procedures. Evaluate all content RCs received from the TO Manager.
     Ensure the RC is appropriate and accurate in every respect. Ensure it complies with the
     applicable specification for depth of coverage and reading grade level (RGL).
        3.2.3.1. All RCs which could affect the end item OSS&E must be coordinated with the
        program Chief Engineer or equivalent prior to approval (see paragraph 1.4.3).
        3.2.3.2. The TCM will initiate a JCALS ―Recommend A TM Change‖ screen (see 3.2.2
        and the DI) for emergency RCs (ITO messages) and internally generated RCs. If the
        TCM is not a JCALS user, responses to an emergency RC will be made using an AFTO
        IMT 22 (or AF IMT 847 for FMP publications), and internally generated changes will
        be documented on an AFMC IMT 252. All RCs will have a Local Control Number
        (LCN).
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                 55


     3.2.3.3. Create an LCN for internally-generated RCs as follows (without the spaces):


      5       1M     OCLAHTA        5    001
      5                                          Identifies the RC as FMM, TO
                                                 Manager or TCMgenerated
              1M                                 Command Designator Code for AFMC
                     OCLAHTA                     Preparing activity (e.g., 63, HQ, AAC,
                                                 AG, ASC, ESC, SMC, MSG, OC, OO,
                                                 WR, etc.) and initiator office symbol
                                                 (must total 7 characters; use preceding
                                                 zeros if needed).
                                    5            Last digit of current calendar year.
                                         001     Control number; start with 001 each
                                                 calendar year.

  3.2.4. RC Completion. Update the recommendation status (TO 00-5-1) on the screen.
  Complete the ―Disposition‖ field of the RC screen. Use the exact wording which should be
  included in the TO for the approved recommendation. Other actions include inputting or
  changing the priority (default is ―Routine‖), changing the values of tangible benefits and/or
  changing benefits from tangible to intangible when appropriate.
     3.2.4.1. Use the following guidance in conjunction with TO 00-5-1 when assigning
     Status Codes in JCALS:
          - Abeyance: The maximum allowable time is one year after receipt of the RC for
          evaluation, plus 180 days for publishing and distribution.
          - Advisement: The resolution date will be the maximum RC processing time,
          extended by any advisement periods.
          - Duplicate: Enter the previous AFTO IMT 22 or IDEA number, or other source for
          the original recommended change in the Remarks block. Duplicate status closes the
          RC.
          - Approved: Improvements are considered approved if the intent of the
          recommendation is incorporated in the TO even if the wording is changed.
          - Deferred: Do not defer minor corrections to TOs distributed and used in digital
          formats. NOTE: ―Deferred‖ is not a choice in JCALS. If a change managed in
          JCALS must be deferred, use ―Abeyance.‖
     3.2.4.2. JCALS does not support the formerly-used status codes for ―Being
     Evaluated,‖ ―Deleted,‖ ―Distributed,‖ ―Priority Change from,‖ ―Publication,‖
     ―Renumbered TO,‖ ―Rescinded,‖ or ―Transferred to ALC.‖ The replacement JCALS
     codes are:
          - Saved – Indicates the TO Manager has initiated work on the RC, but is awaiting
          further information before submitting it to the evaluator (TCM).
          - Active – When the RC has been submitted to the TCM for evaluation.
          - Interim Reply – Interim status has been provided to the initiator.
          - Validated – Optional selection for the TO Manager or TCM, depending on the
56                                                    AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


        extent of the change and if a contractor developed the procedures.
        - Verified – Optional selection for the TO Manager or TCM depending on whether
        the change required verification.
     3.2.4.3. For Emergency recommendations, include a copy of the Interim Operational
     or Safety supplement (IOS or ISS), RAC, or ITCTO (see AFMCI 21-302), or priority
     downgrade message in the ―Recommend a TM Change‖ - . Coordinate priority
     downgrades with the initiating MAJCOM CCP. The TO increment or notification
     message of downgrading, duplicate RC, or RC disapproval is the only reply to initiators
     required. Submit coordinated and approved priority ITOs and recommendations to the
     TO Manager for publication of a formal TO update if required.
     3.2.4.4. Reply to Initiator. Reply to initiators using the originally submitted RC form
     attached to an e-mail, or through the JCALS WFM if originally submitted as a
     JCALS RC. Document approval/disapproval and processing status changes on the
     originally submitted RC (digital form, paragraphs 3.1.1 through 3.1.7). Status of RCs
     submitted through ETIMS is automatically tracked and reported by the system.
        - F IMT 847: complete according to AFI 11-215.
        - AFTO IMT 22: complete blocks 23 through 28. Block 24 must include the TCM
        name, rank, DSN, and e-mail address. When required, block 25 must contain the
        same information for the TCM supervisor. Use copies of the original RC to make
        ―Interim Replies‖ as required, when downgrading, changing status to advisement
        or abeyance, or when limiting factors prevent publishing TM updates immediately.
        Block 28 does not require completion for interim replies.
        3.2.4.4.1. Use AFTO IMT 22 blocks 26 & 27 and the Continuation block to
        report other actions to the initiator, whether the status is advisement, abeyance,
        approved, disapproved, or duplicate. Complete block 27, Remarks, explaining all
        actions taken to the initiator, except for abeyance which requires no comments. Enter
        justification for downgrading the urgency and/or changing the values entered in
        blocks 21 & 22. Do not change the AFTO 22 ―type‖ (Improvement or Correction)
        without the concurrence of the Lead Command or MAJCOM CCP. Include
        reasons for any modifications to the recommended change and for considering the RC
        a ―duplicate‖ (if applicable). Also, enter justification for awarding intangible versus
        tangible IDEA benefits (block 28), or for changing the calculation of tangible
        benefits for approved ―improvement-type‖ RCs.
        3.2.4.4.2. All approved RCs must be coordinated with affected functional OPRs
        (see paragraph 3.5.4) prior to signature and final approval.
        3.2.4.4.3. Enter the date the reply is dispatched from the PM/SCM in block 23. Sign
        block 24 if a supervisor signature is required in block 25. When authorized to
        release the reply, the TCM may sign block 25 (TO 00-5-1). The electronic copy
        returned to the submitter and reviewers may have ―//SIGNED//‖ entered in AFTO
        IMT 22 blocks 24 and 25, while a signed copy is kept on file for two years or until
        incorporated (whichever is longer) by the TCM. Complete block 28 on all approved
        ―Improvement-type‖ AFTO IMTs 22.
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                               57


      3.2.4.5. When the TCM has made an interim reply, follow-on replies must be made on
      or before the specified resolution date. Complete follow-on replies as specified above.
      3.2.4.6. Return the annotated copy of the AFTO IMT 22 via e-mail to the addressees in
      blocks 1, 2, 3, 8 and 9 any time the status changes. A copy of the completed JCALS
      ―Recommend a TM Change‖ screen may be attached.
   3.2.5. RCs Applicable to Multiple TOs. Technical data are sometimes contained in or
   affect related data in multiple TOs whose responsibility belongs to different PM/SCM
   organizations. The TCM responsible for preparing a change package to any TO must make
   every effort to identify all affected TOs, and coordinate with and submit corresponding
   changes to the responsible TCMs.
   3.2.6. RCs Applicable to Depot TOs. Provide an information copy of RCs affecting
   depot maintenance TOs to the maintenance directorate for planning purposes.
3.3. Evaluating Recommended Changes (RCs) on Joint Service TMs.
   3.3.1. Air Force-Managed TMs. Handle proposed changes to Joint Service TMs
   managed by the Air Force (cognizant activity code F) according to paragraph 3.2.
   3.3.2. Other Component-Managed TMs. The assigned Air Force TO Manager handles
   receipt and JCALS entry of proposed changes to Joint Service TMs managed by another
   DoD component the same as for an RC against an Air Force TO.
   3.3.3. Procedures for TMs Managed by Other DoD Components. The Air Force TCM
   evaluates the recommended TM improvement and determines required actions. (NOTE:
   Downgrading RC priority is not appropriate when the TM is the responsibility of another
   DoD component.) If there is no assigned AF TCM, the TO manager will forward RCs to the
   managing component for evaluation.
      3.3.3.1. For AF-approved RCs, the TO Manager or TCM issues an Air Force-only routine
      supplement in accordance with TO 00-5-1. The TCM then routes the JCALS
      ―Recommend A TM Change‖ - or an information copy of the approved AFTO IMT
      22/AFMC IMT 252 to the responsible DoD component according to AFJI 21-301.
      3.3.3.2. The TCM furnishes an information copy of disapproved AFTO IMTs 22 to
      OPR in the responsible DoD component for possible implementation.
      3.3.3.3. When an RC is placed in Abeyance or Advisement status, notification of the
      responsible DoD component is not required. Process the RCs according to paragraphs
      3.3.3.1 or 3.3.3.2 after approval or disapproval. Do not refer duplicate RCs to the
      other service. Do not use ―Deferred‖ status for RCs against other service TMs.
   3.3.4. Rescind any AF-only supplement if the managing component incorporates the
   change in the TM.
3.4. Processing Innovative Development through Employee Awareness (IDEA) Program
Packages. TO 00-5-1 and AFI 38-401, The Air Force Innovative Development through
Employee Awareness (IDEA) Program, specify the general policies and procedures for
handling IDEA inputs (suggestions) affecting the TO System.
   3.4.1. Stand-Alone Ideas. Answer a stand-alone idea which causes a TO change using
   the IDEA Program Data System (IPDS, https://ipds.mont.disa.mil/IPDS). Enter
58                                                       AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


     approved changes into JCALS according to paragraph 3.2.2 and the DI. Retain the
     JCALS ―Recommend a TM Change‖ - implementing approved changes, including any
     documentation used to calculate tangible or intangible savings, for two years IAW Air Force
     Records Disposition Schedule (https://webrims.amc.af.mil/rds/index.cfm).
     3.4.2. Confirmatory Ideas. The Idea Analyst will automatically approve a confirmatory
     Idea based on an approved ―Improvement-type‖ RC , and base the award on AFI 38-401 and
     the information provided in the RC. ―Correction-type‖ RCs are not eligible for monetary
     recognition.
     3.4.3. Disputing Findings. If the initiator disputes the IDEA program benefits
     approved by the TCM, the RC must be returned to the TCM with additional information
     justifying any requested increase in benefit levels, IAW TO 00-5-1.
3.5. JCALS ―Prepare TM Change Package‖ Procedures. The ―Prepare TM Change
Package‖ function must be completed for all TO update actions, including issuance of RACs and
to incorporate (replace) interim safety and operational supplements with a formal TO update. It
is not required to issue an IOS or ISS. NOTE: Recommended changes which have not been
entered into the JCALS system will not be available to the ―Prepare TM Change Package‖
function. RCs (and ITOs) to be included in a TO update must be entered in JCALS, or require
using an off-line, work-around process (such as the digital AFMC IMT 252 process) to prepare
a TO change package.
     3.5.1. TO Manager Procedures. The responsible TO Manager will consolidate approved
     TO change packages from all sources affecting the same TO using the JCALS ―Prepare
     TM Change Package‖ process. Include all approved technical RCs stored in JCALS prior to
     the time limit specified in Figure 3.1. Routine editorial RCs (typos, non-technical changes,
     etc.) to paper TOs, not affecting TO understanding and compliance, may be held until the
     affected page or backing page is updated for technical changes. RCs include both TCM-
     generated changes (paragraph 3.2.2) and user-submitted changes. Complete the JCALS
     ―Prepare TM Change Package‖ screens in accordance with procedures in the DI. The
     system will create a - and include the selected RCs and any applicable attachments.
        3.5.1.1. In conjunction with the TCM, review and update the TO Classification and
        distribution limitation statements as required.
        3.5.1.2. The TO Manager will prepare an AFTO IMT 124, Computation of Technical
        Order Reading Grade Level, based on criteria specified below:

            - Compute RGL on the entire text when more than 25% of the original text is
            changed. Exclude original text if the change adds new sections and/or chapters.
            Example: TO 2J-F100-6, chapters 1 thru 9 (original text) – the addition of chapter 10
            would not require recheck of chapters 1 through 9.
            - Compute RGL on only the changed text when changing two or more consecutive
            pages of text.
            - Do not compute RGL if changing two or less consecutive pages of text.
            - Review existing commercial manuals for RGL according to MIL-HDBK-1221. Do
            not reject or rewrite the manuals solely for RGL.
            - MIL-STD-38784 specifies an RGL of ―9‖ for Air Force TOs. NOTE: The grade
            level can be tailored during the contracting process.
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                              59


     3.5.1.3. The TO Manager will obtain (or ensure the TCM has obtained) an Environmental
     Assessment if there are any environmental impacts (see AFI 32-7061, The Environmental
     Impact Analysis Process).
     3.5.1.4. Routing and Coordination. Route the change package (work folder) as follows:
        3.5.1.4.1. The Chief Engineer will check technical and procedural changes to verify
        the system or equipment OSS&E certification (AFI 63-1201) has not been
        affected. (This step is required even if individual RCs had already been reviewed,
        because of possible interactions between different proposed changes.)
        3.5.1.4.2. Obtain a Nuclear Surety Technical Evaluation (paragraph 1.7) on
        change packages affecting Nuclear Surety Procedures (NSP) or Hardness Critical
        Items (HCI).
        3.5.1.4.3. The applicable Center/Base Safety Offices will coordinate on all change
        packages affecting personnel or equipment safety. Bioenvironmental Engineering
        will coordinate on procedures affecting personnel health (involving noise, heat,
        air contaminants, chemicals, radiation, lasers, thermal stresses, biological and
        ergonomic hazards, etc.) (See paragraph 1.6).
        3.5.1.4.4. The specialized functions listed in TO 00-5-1, Table 5-1 (e.g., Non-
        Destructive Inspection [NDI], Corrosion Control, Life Support, Civil Engineer
        Readiness, etc.), will coordinate on change packages affecting the assigned areas of
        responsibility. NOTE: ALC organizations designated to provide Level III NDI
        services may provide NDI coordination, but must provide a copy of the - to the AF
        NDI POC, AFRL/MLS-OL, 4750 Staff Dr, Tinker AFB OK 73145-3317.
        3.5.1.4.5. Coordinate change package (work folders) applicable to military systems
        or commodities operated by foreign governments (e.g., FMS and European
        Participating Air Force) with AFSAC. AFSAC Country Managers initiate
        development of related updates to CSTOs.
        3.5.1.4.6. Coordinate change packages with applicable Scientific & Technical
        Information (STINFO), Security, Legal, FDO and PA offices to validate or change
        distribution limitations for both the change or revision and the basic TO.
        3.5.1.4.7. Obtain a releasability review from the FDO on all TO changes affecting
        restricted distribution TOs that are issued to foreign customers. If an update
        does not contain any restricted data, and the TO itself was releasable, the FDO
        does not need to coordinate on the change package. However, if the update DOES
        contain restricted data (or the TCM thinks it might be restricted data) then the
        coordination workflow must include the FDO. The FDO enters applicable country
        codes or ―Not Authorized for Release‖. NOTE: The FDO may waive coordination
        on changes when the parent TO or series of TOs is for a non-releasable system
        or commodity (such as nuclear weapons), and the TO Manager will enter a non-
        release statement in the Remarks block.
        3.5.1.4.8. Coordinate change packages impacting commodity items managed by
        other Product Groups with the responsible group.
60                                                        AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


            3.5.1.4.9. Coordinate RCs against end-item TOs managed by an SPD, which affect
            commodities assigned to a Product Group Manager (PGM), with the affected PGM.
        3.5.1.5. Early Implementation. TO users shall not implement approved RCs until the
        interim or formal TO update is available, except as follows:
            3.5.1.5.1. AFMC IMTs 252 or JCALS RCs generated from AFTO IMTs 22 initiated
            by the AF Primary Standards Laboratory (AFPSL), or issued against Test,
            Measurement & Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) TOs or ICBM Depot Control
            Manuals (paragraph 3.7), may be implemented upon approval, when early
            implementation is requested and justified by the initiator. If early implementation is
            approved, the TCM will enter ―Approved for Implementation‖ in the Disposition
            block of the RC.
            3.5.1.5.2. AFMC IMTs 252 or JCALS RCs generated from work stoppage or
            anticipated work stoppage AFMC IMTs 202 submitted by depot maintenance will be
            stamped or marked ―Special Handling‖ (see Chapter 5) prior to depot
            implementation.
            3.5.1.5.3. Updates approved for early implementation in Interactive Electronic
            Technical Manuals (IETM) will be merged with the IETM data base and published
            by the TO Manager on a secure server with access by authorized users only.
            3.5.1.5.4. All TO updates approved for early implementation must be routed through
            the TO Manager to the affected TODOs. AFTO IMTs 22 will NOT be authorized for
            early implementation.
3.6. TM Change Package Processing. The responsible TO Manager will:
     3.6.1. Screen and Submit Change Packages. Screen all TM Change Packages to ensure
     required data is current and complete, properly coordinated and includes all RCs
     specified for the next TO update. Submit approved change packages to the editorial
     function for publication of the TO update (specifying the update type), and distribute in the
     next routine update cycle for the TO. A first-level or higher level supervisor must approve
     urgent or priority publication of TO change packages.
     3.6.2. Record Copy. Archive a copy of the package in the JCALS - for the TO.
     3.6.3. TO Training Update. Provide copies of coordinated and approved TM Change
     Package - work folders on the 00-5-series TOs to 362 TRS/TRR (AETC), 613 10th Ave,
     Sheppard AFB TX 76311, to facilitate update of TO System training courses.
3.7. RAC Notification, Distribution and Time Limits. A RAC is an interim TO update
(Supplement) loosely formatted as a TO Change and distributed like an ITO/ITCTO. It is
prepared using PC desktop publishing or word processing software and saved as an Adobe™
portable document format (*.pdf) file.
     3.7.1. Notification. When a RAC is issued (normally by posting on a web page),
     notification is sent (E-mail or DMS message) to all affected TODOs as required in AFMCI
     21-302.
        3.7.1.1. It is crucial that TO Managers or their designees manage assigned Defense
        Message System (DMS) Address Lists or Personal Distribution Lists (ALs or PDLs)
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                61


     aggressively in order for the notification process to work effectively. The manager must
     periodically pull a JCALS publication (TO) ID (subscription) report for managed TOs, to
     confirm that all TODO TM Accounts are included on the DMS AL or PDL being
     utilized. OC-ALC/LGLU (the Air Force TO Archive) must be an addressee on all ALs
     and PDLs. Note that because user names and passwords must be included in notification
     messages for restricted distribution data, regular non-secure e-mail can onl y be used
     for notifications about unclassified, public release T O s and RACs.
     (WORKAROUND: Send two e-mails: the user name in one e-mail, and the password in
     another.)
     3.7.1.2. The TCM or TO Manager will send a RAC notification message to all affected
     TODO TM Accounts using any method which will meet the security requirements and
     time limits listed below. The preferred RAC notification method is to send an encrypted
     message to each affected base using an AL or PDL. The message will contain the
     affected TO number and title, the RAC number and date, criticality (Emergency or
     Urgent), the file names and sizes of the merged TO (if applicable) and RAC files (the
     size is required to ensure users have enough hard drive space to successfully
     accomplish the download). The message must also provide either the e-mail
     transmission date and time (when distributing via e-mail) or the IP address, user name
     and password for accessing the FTP site where digital RAC files are hosted (when
     distributing via FTP). When individual TO files are also password protected, the file
     passwords will be included in the message. Messages must include a point of contact
     and phone number to call in case of any technical problems.
  3.7.2. Distribution. Any one of three methods of RAC distribution described below may
  be used. The Internet method is preferred:
     3.7.2.1. Internet. RACs against TOs used digitally will be merged electronically with the
     affected baseline TO and both the merged file and the stand-alone RAC file will be
     loaded on a limited-access ―https‖ or ―ftps‖ site. Only the stand-alone RAC will be
     loaded on the site when the affected TO is paper only. TODOs will be notified of the
     update by message.
        NOTES:
        1. Classified TO files must be password protected and encrypted (AFI 33-129),
        and loaded on an access-controlled (domain or user name and password) https or ftps
        site.
        2. RACs for distribution statement "A" TOs may be hosted on public web sites.
     3.7.2.2. E-Mail. For smaller TOs (file size less than 2MB) and a limited user base, the
     merged TO file and/or stand-alone RAC file could be distributed to TODOs as e-mail or
     DMS attachments. Set the e-mail options to obtain confirmation of message receipt.
     3.7.2.3. Physical Distribution. When one of the above procedures cannot be used,
     priority mail or package services may be used to deliver paper or digital copies of RACs
     on computer disks.

     3.7.3. Time Limits. RAC issue and notification time limits are as follows (TO 00-5-1,
     Chapter 9):
        3.7.3.1. EMERGENCY – issue RAC and notification message within 48 hours after
        receipt of an emergency report (within 72 hours if report concerns work stoppage).
        3.7.3.2. URGENT – issue RAC and notification message within 40 calendar days after
        receipt of an urgent report.
        3.7.3.3. Notification Message Priorities – EMERGENCY RAC notification messages
        are sent using DMS Immediate precedence, and must be delivered within 2 hours of
        receipt. URGENT notification messages are sent using Priority precedence, requiring
        delivery as soon as possible during duty hours.
3.8. Depot Level ICBM Operation and Maintenance Control Manuals. The following
applies to ICBM Control Manuals and associated Contractor Data Manuals (CDM), which
consist of Utility Technical Manuals, D2s, Performance Criteria Documents, test equipment
instruction manuals, etc.
     3.8.1. Description. Control manuals and associated CDMs are acquired to support
     Minuteman II and III missiles using Boeing Space Division (BSD) Exhibit 64-29. Control
     manuals are numbered as USAF TOs and list applicable CDMs under the contractor-
     assigned numbers. Specific operation and maintenance procedures are included in the
     CDMs.
     3.8.2. Deficiency Reporting. Deficiencies in CDMs are reported by AFTO IMT 22 or
     JCALS ―Recommend a TM Change‖ screen against the control manual TO number. Block 19
     of the AFTO IMT 22 or the ―Deficiency‖ field of the RC will list the CDM number as well as
     the deficiency noted and recommended corrective action.
     3.8.3. Processing. JCALS RC and ―Prepare TM Change Package‖ procedures and
     workaround described in paragraph 3.5 apply to control manuals and CDMs.
        3.8.3.1. Control manual or CDM RCs are issued against the control manual TO
        number. When applicable, the CDM number is shown in the ―Deficiency‖ field of the
        RC, and the other entries relate to the control manual. CDM change pages are provided
        with the control manual change.
        3.8.3.2. The JCALS RC ―Local Control Number‖ will be listed in the rescission notice of
        the control manual and CDM changes incorporating it.
     3.8.4. Implementation. The depot level maintenance activity posts a printout of an
     ―Approved for Implementation/Special Handling‖ JCALS RC - with the control manual
     and CDM to which it applies. The printout will be retained until the TO RC is listed in the
     rescission notice of a permanent change to the control manual.

4.1. General. TCTOs provide instructions for modifying military systems or commodities,
initiate special ―one time‖ inspections or impose temporary restrictions on systems or
equipment within specified time limits. TCTOs for fielded systems and equipment are planned,
prepared and issued by the responsible ES/TCM (or modification manager) under the authority
of the affected system/equipment PM/SCM. The TO Manager is responsible for assisting an
ES/TCM or Modification Manager with the development and publication of TCTOs and related
TO Updates. TO 00-5-15 prescribes policies and procedures for modification of systems and
equipment during acquisition, and for managing the Air Force TCTO system.
     4.1.1. Approval. Configuration change TCTOs must be authorized by the PM
     Configuration Control Board (CCB) in accordance with AFPD 63-11, Modification System,
     and AFI 63-1101, Modification Management, based on contractor inputs (through the ECP
     process), a MAJCOM Program Management Directive (PMD), or from an organic change
     proposal or Materiel Improvement Project (MIP). TCTOs will be coordinated with all
     affected using commands and single managers/chief engineers of other affected systems
     and/or commodities as early in the process as possible.
     4.1.2. Development. Once the engineering change is approved by the PM CCB, prototype
     kits and preliminary TCTOs and related TO Updates are developed. Prototype TCTO kits
     will undergo trial installation. Kits are then prepared and TCTO verification conducted.
     Following completion of the TCTO/related TO Update verification, TCTO kits are produced
     and TCTOs and TO Updates are published. Preparation and release of TCTOs concurrently
     with the release of the TCTO kit is Air Force policy and is the responsibility of the PM.
     Following completion of the modification program, verified through system configuration
     management records, the ES/TCM or Production Management Activity (PMA) will notify
     the TO Manager to rescind the TCTO.
     4.1.3. Inspection TCTOs. Inspection TCTOs are non-configuration change TCTOs issued
     to accomplish a one-time inspection, inspection and replacement of hardware with like
     serviceable items, inspection and repair in accordance with system/equipment repair
     manuals, or any similar requirement which does not change form, fit, or function. The
     affected PM Division Chief may authorize non-configuration change TCTOs.
     4.1.4. Forms Used. There are three important forms that are used to document key
     information concerning equipment modifications and the TCTO required to implement the
     inspection or modification. The AFMC IMT 873, Time Compliance Technical Order
     Requirements, documents the plan and requirements for accomplishing a TCTO. The
     AFMC IMT 874, Time Compliance Technical Order Supply Data Requirements, is used
     as an assembly document for all supply information required to ensure TCTO/TCTO Kits
     are available before the TCTO is released. The AFMC IMT 875, Time Compliance
     Technical Order Programming Document, serves as a checklist for the PM to determine
     when all logistics actions are accomplished to support the completion of a TCTO and related
     TO Updates.
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                              67


  4.1.5. Changing TCTO Instructions. Additional or changed data which supersedes,
  replaces or supplements instructions in any TCTO must be issued by a formal TCTO
  supplement or replacing TCTO (interim or formal copy). Technical information will not be
  issued in letter or message format. See TO 00-5-15 for exceptions.
  4.1.6. Depot Field Team Support. When a TCTO requires depot support or traveling
  team accomplishment in accordance with TO 00-25-4, Depot Maintenance of Aerospace
  Vehicles and Training Equipment, the TCM or PMA ensures advance information regarding
  work requirements is provided to the affected PM depot maintenance activity, to allow
  planning for the use of internal assets and resources.
  4.1.7. Safety TCTOs. The corrective actions for safety deficiencies that impose ―remove
  from service‖ or flight restrictions are issued in a TCTO.
  4.1.8. Coordination. The PM activity preparing the TCTO for the corrective action
  coordinates the TCTO with all other PMs involved. Compliance times for TCTOs resulting
  from permanent modifications are recommended by the PM IAW TO 00-5-15, and
  coordinated with the MAJCOM as part of the modification certification, coordination and
  approval CCB process.
  4.1.9. Release Instructions. Some conditions may require accomplishment of more than
  one TCTO before lifting of restrictions. When such conditions arise, a TCTO supplement
  is prepared by the responsible PM giving proper release instructions.
     4.1.9.1. Under no circumstances will the PM include releasing statements in the
     corrective action TCTO. The PM issuing the corrective action TCTO provides the
     TCTO number to the end item PM as early as possible.
     4.1.9.2. TCTOs affecting FMP publications must be coordinated with the Flight Manual
     Manager. Flight Manuals must be updated concurrently with affected maintenance TOs.
  4.1.10. Updating Affected TOs. TCTOs must NOT direct write-in changes to related TOs.
     4.1.10.1. TO and Flight Manual updates for immediate action TCTOs are provided by
     RACs, ISSs or IOSs issued concurrently with the Interim TCTO IAW TO 00-5-1 and
     AFMCI 21-302. Updates supporting urgent action TCTOs may be issued as interim
     supplements or formal TO updates.
     4.1.10.2. If a routine or urgent action TCTO results in changes of TO or Flight Manual
     procedures, the TO updates are submitted through the JCALS ―Recommend a TM
     Change‖ and ―Prepare TM Change Package‖ or AFMC IMT 252 functions according
     to Chapter 3, concurrently with the TCTO package (or publication lead time prior to the
     TCTO submission) to ensure release prior to or concurrently with the TCTO. TO update
     packages containing both ―before‖ and ―after‖ data may be submitted and published up to
     6 months prior to TCTO release.
     4.1.10.3. Any time the driving TCTO is changed or placed in Abeyance, updates to the
     affected TOs must be reviewed and amended if necessary.
  4.1.11. Changing TCTO Urgency. The urgency of a published TCTO may be changed by
  issuance of a TCTO supplement or replacement TCTO. The action requires approval at the
  same level as the original TCTO approval authority.
68                                                            AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


     4.1.12. TCTO Verification. Verification of TCTOs and related TO updates, with or
     without kits, is mandatory. Verification must include checking for possible interaction
     with other proposed or on-going TCTOs to the same system or end item. Verification will
     be documented on an AFTO IMT 82, TCTO Verification Certificate. All related TO
     updates will be listed in block 14 of the AFTO IMT 82 with an annotation of acceptability.
     A waiver of verification by performance must be documented on the AFTO IMT 82 in
     accordance with TO 00-5-15. TCTO and TO deficiencies noted in block 12 of the AFTO
     IMT 82 must be corrected prior to release of the TCTO and kits to installing activities.
     4.1.13. Production Management Functions. Upon receipt of a TCTO or a procurable
     modification data package from a TCM and a kit assembly package from the Program
     Manager, the responsible end item or commodity PMA performs the below management
     functions for permanent modifications:
     - Preparing purchase requests for, or initiating action to assemble related kits.
     - Preparing required status reporting documentation for the Systems and Equipment
     Modification Maintenance System (G079) and required funds obligation forms for entry
     into the Control Procurement Accounting System.
     - Ensuring TCTOs are verified, using TCM assistance as required.
     - Ensuring the completion of an AFTO IMT 82 and maintaining it in the TCTO file.
     - Maintaining kit delivery and distribution schedules.
     - Ensuring logistics support (spares, affected TO updates, data and Support Equipment [SE])
     is available concurrently with release of the TCTO and kits.
     - Managing the accomplishment of the TCTO or modification to the affected military
     system, commodities and affected spares as required, and tracking compliance.
     - Rescinding TCTOs or extending rescission dates as necessary.
     - Initiating requests for proper disposition action on any excess kits.
     - Ensuring the computer program (software on the appropriate medium, if required) has
     been prepared by the responsible computer resources activity and sufficient quantities are
     available for concurrent distribution with the TCTO and any applicable TO updates.
     4.1.14. Single-TCTO Process. A single TCTO for removal, modification and reinstallation
     of components and return of end items to serviceable status is authorized for use only as
     indicated below. For all other systems and commodities, companion TCTOs are issued
     according to paragraph 4.1.9.
        4.1.14.1. Managers may issue a single Category 2 (Airborne Engines) TCTO to
        modify the engine, whether or not installed in the aircraft. The single TCTO method will
        only be used if it will accommodate all Comprehensive Engine Management System
        (CEMS) and Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS) tracking and reporting
        functions supporting field and depot activities. TCTOs applicable to a commodity
        installed on the engine will be issued in the appropriate commodity TO category, with a
        companion TO Category 2 TCTO for removal of the unmodified item and installation of
        the modified item to provide engine configuration tracking information.
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                 69


     4.1.14.2. A single system or end item TCTO may be issued when no TCTO category
     exists for the commodity item to be modified.
  4.1.15. Commodity Modifications. When a commodity is to be modified, the TCM
  responsible for the item prepares the commodity TCTO and any required companion system
  TCTOs. When a system modification affects commodities, the TCM responsible for the
  system prepares both the system TCTO and the required companion commodity TCTOs.
  The TCM preparing the TCTOs coordinates with all affected TCMs and PMs. Coordination
  is accomplished on a priority basis consistent with the urgency of the TCTO. The TCM who
  owns affected equipment for which another TCM is writing a system or companion TCTO
  must provide all required source data for TCTO development.
     4.1.15.1. Production Management and the preparing TCM are responsible for initiating
     action to include the TCTOs in the Reliability & Maintainability Information System
     (REMIS), and for performing follow-up.
     4.1.15.2. After coordination and approval, the affected TCM obtains the companion
     TCTO number and data code from the servicing TO Manager, and furnishes the numbers
     to the PMA managing the modification. When a PMA receives a TCTO and data code for
     the companion TCTO, the activity, in conjunction with the TCM, accepts responsibility
     for all areas of TCTO management. The PMA or TCM is responsible for determining all
     follow-on actions (rescission, supplements, extension, etc.), and recommending the
     action to the TO Manager.
         4.1.15.2.1. If the TCTO is for depot level accomplishment, the TCM writes a field
         level companion TCTO to remove and ship the commodity to the source of repair
         and replace it with a modified item. If the depot modification will be done on an
         attrition basis, no companion TCTO is required. IPBs will be updated to reflect the
         modified equipment part number used for field-level replacement.
         4.1.15.2.2. If the TCTO is field level accomplishment, then a companion TCTO is
         required only if the item is to be modified before the next scheduled or unscheduled
         removal for other reasons. The preparing TCM and using command maintenance
         directorate negotiate an agreement for establishing the compliance period for field
         level TCTOs.
     4.1.15.3. The originator of a commodity TCTO prepares and issues the companion
     system TCTO, but the affected PM furnishes the inspection or removal and replacement
     instructions. The originator of the TCTO establishes the time frame for the receipt of the
     information based on the urgency of the TCTO.
     4.1.15.4. In the case of an item being modified, it is preferable to modify the entire
     inventory through the commodity TCTO and use the companion system TCTO for
     removal of unmodified and installation of modified items in the end item.
     4.1.15.5. When work involved in one TCTO is dependent upon other TCTOs, an
     appropriate statement based on MIL-PRF-38804, Time Compliance Technical Orders,
     Preparation of, and the AFMC IMT 873, Time Compliance Technical Order
     Requirements shall be included under WHEN TO BE ACCOMPLISHED in all
     involved TCTOs.
70                                                        AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


        4.1.15.6. The TCM shall ensure TCTO reporting instructions are identified in paragraph
        8 of the TCTO. Compliance will be reported using the basic TCTO data code
        only, according to 00-20-series TOs. Additional work directed by TCTO supplements
        will be reported using the supplement data code. Enter the TCTO Master Record into
        REMIS.
     4.1.16. TCTOs on Special Federal Supply Group (FSG) Items. Proposed modifications
     to specifications or configuration changes to FSG 59 (electronics piece parts), FSG 60 (fiber
     optics), or Federal Stock Class (FSC) 6145 (wire and cable) source coded to Defense
     Logistics Agency (DLA) must have 645 LOG/ES approval on the AF IMT 3525, CCB
     Modification Requirements and Approval Document, prior to CCB approval and
     subsequent TCTO processing.
     4.1.17. TCTOs on Radar Equipment. The policy on modification of radar equipment
     used jointly by the Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is in the
     numbered minutes of the Joint Radar Planning Group.
     4.1.18. Modifications    to     Commercial-Derivative          Aircraft. Modifications     to
     commercial-derivative aircraft that will retain FAA certification must comply with the intent
     of AFPD 62-4, Standards of Airworthiness for Passenger-Carrying Commercial Derivative
     Transport Aircraft, and AFPD 62-5, Standards of Airworthiness for Commercial Derivative
     Hybrid Aircraft.
     4.1.19. Commercial and Other-DoD-Component Modification Instructions. Service
     bulletins, other military service modification instructions, and similar publications
     prepared by manufacturers or other government agencies are not approved for distribution to
     Air Force personnel for compliance, except as specified in TOs 00-5-1 or 00-5-15. The TCM,
     depot engineering or technical support activities and/or FMMs will review the publications.
     If approved for AF use, the TO Manager assigns TCTO and data code numbers, a
     compliance period, issue and rescission dates in JCALS, and an authority line to the
     publication. The publications are distributed through normal Air Force channels. Any
     activity receiving other than authorized instructions contacts the TCM to obtain authorized
     versions. (EXCEPTIONS: Contractor or manufacturer-prepared service bulletins to correct
     deficiencies in general-purpose commercial ground vehicles will be complied with.
     Programs supported by Contractor Logistics Support [CLS] or using approved commercial
     manuals in lieu of MILSPEC TOs may use updates provided by the prime contractor.)
     4.1.20. TCTOs Applicable to SAP/FMS. TCTOs applicable to military systems or
     commodities used by SAP/FMS require some coordination with the countries involved.
     Notify the affected country managers of all safety of flight and all releasable (FDO
     approved) modifications applicable to the SAP/FMS equipment. Send the modification
     offering (AF IMT 3525) to the country in sufficient time to allow the country to identify kit
     requirements for participation in a consolidated kit buy. The Air Force Security Assistance
     Center (AFSAC)/IPS must be advised to assure any required coordination actions are taken.
     See TO 00-5-19 for additional details.
     4.1.21. Electronic Warfare (EW) Systems. The responsible PM periodically updates
     software for EW systems which impact the TOs managed by an aircraft or training device
     SPD at a different location. Concurrent release of the changed software and updates to all
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                71


  TOs affected by the software change is required. To facilitate concurrent release, the
  following procedures apply:
     4.1.21.1. The commodity EW TCM ensures current aircraft or training operations TOs (-
     1 series) and maintenance (-2 series) checkout procedures are available from the
     responsible SPDs.
     4.1.21.2. The commodity EW TCM prepares a draft of the changed checkout procedures
     and verifies the changes with affected aircraft or training system SPD assistance during
     verification of the TCTO and affected TO source data. The commodity EW TCM
     furnishes verified, marked-up copy of source data for all affected TOs to the applicable
     SPDs.
     4.1.21.3. Affected aircraft or training system SPDs ensure initial distribution of formal
     updates to affected TOs is completed as follows:
         4.1.21.3.1. When less than 50 pages of TO data are affected and TO updates are
         organically prepared, initial distribution will be accomplished within 90 calendar
         days of receipt of verified source data. The 90 days is divided as: TCM, 30; TO
         Manager, 45; and Printing and Distribution, 15 days.
         4.1.21.3.2. When preparation of TO updates is accomplished by a contractor or
         when 50 or more TO pages are affected, the EW TO Manager and the TO
         Managers for the aircraft or training systems will negotiate a mutually agreeable
         initial distribution date.
  4.1.22. Establishing a JCALS Record. Records are established in the JCALS Pub
  Index (and reflected in the TO Catalog) for TCTO Series listings and for individual TCTOs
  (issued either as a formal publication or as an interim message) using AFMC IMT 203 or
  appropriate JCALS TM processes. Rescission dates for individual TCTOs will be entered
  into JCALS.
     4.1.22.1. The TO Manager must establish a TCTO Header Series listing before obtaining
     a number for and publication of the first TCTO in the series. When classified TCTOs will
     be issued, separate Headers must be established for each different classification of
     TCTO to be covered under the series. Headers allow TODOs to establish ID
     requirements before TCTO publication quantities are established and ID labels have to
     be requested. The TO Manager either initiates a JCALS workflow or submits an AFMC
     IMT 203 to OC-ALC/LGLUB requesting assignment of a TCTO Header number and a
     block of Data Codes. NOTE: A TCTO series listing must be established in the JCALS
     Pub Index before input of individual TCTO data for indexing.
     4.1.22.2. The TO Manager enters TCTO data into the JCALS Pub Index to set up the
     record for individual TCTOs. The JCALS process for automatically assigning data codes
     to TCTOs does not ensure that each code is unique across the Air Force; therefore, the
     manual process of assigning Data Codes from a block provided by OC-ALC/LGLUB
     will be used. The JCALS automatically-assigned data code is changed in the ―Update
     an Index Entry; Management Information‖ screen.
72                                                            AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


4.2. TCTO Kits.
     4.2.1. Identifying Kit Components. The TCTO kit monitor will research and identify
     kit items using the AFMC IMT 185, Request for TCTO Kit Assembly, in accordance with
     AFMAN 23-110, Volume 3, Part 1, Chapter 11, Miscellaneous Materiel Management
     Procedures. Where items cannot be readily identified, cataloging personnel may be able to
     assist. If a requirement exists for non-stocklisted items, initiate action to have ―NC,‖ ―ND,‖ or
     ―L‖ numbers assigned, as applicable. Screen all kit components against critical (short
     supply) lists and investment requirements. Prepare a save list of required components.
     4.2.2. Complete Kit Concept. If any parts will not be included in a TCTO kit, there must be
     a waiver from the complete kit concept signed by the affected PM and Lead Command
     Director of Maintenance. EXCEPTIONS: For inspection TCTOs, commonly available
     tools, parts and materiel required for access and button-up of inspection areas (including
     stocklisted periodic inspection kits) will not be provided in TCTO kits (AFMAN 23-110).
     TCTOs used to announce software-only changes to baselined computer programs (TOs 00-
     5-15 & 00-5-17, Users Manual; USAF Computer Program Identification Numbering (CPIN)
     System) are also non-kitted. No waivers are required.
     4.2.3. Computer Programs. CPIN items required to perform or check compliance of the
     TCTO are procured from the responsible engineering activity identified in the Computer
     Program Compendium/ Index and issued in TCTO kits.
     4.2.4. Supply Screening. AF supply stocks will be screened (AFMC IMT 172,
     Coordination of Proposed Technical Orders) prior to procurement of any modification kit
     or part to determine if like or similar items in supply can be made available and/or modified
     for kit assembly. Screening action will be accomplished and documented prior to initiation
     of procurement action.
     4.2.5. Substitutions. To avoid delay in assembly and shipment of TCTO kits,
     substitutions may be made on minor parts without the necessity of changing the TCTO.
     Parts substituted for items in the TCTO will be tagged to indicate the substitution and the
     authority. Authority for substitution, when not specified in published stock lists for the
     commodity class, must be obtained from the applicable PM monitoring the project, and
     will be listed in the TCTO whenever possible. Any substitutions authorized must not
     adversely affect the tensile strength, utility, reliability or interchangeability of the assembly as
     intended by the TCTO.
4.3. TCTO Kit Identification and Data Code Numbers.
     4.3.1. Formats. TCTO kit identification and data code numbering formats are in
     TO 00-5-15.
     4.3.2. Data Code Numbers. OC-ALC/LGLUB provides a block of data code numbers to
     each ALC TO Manager for assignment to TCTOs as required. The TO Manager maintains a
     register and controls assignment of the data code numbers. Do not use the data code
     automatically supplied by JCALS, because duplicates may be issued. Notification of data
     code number assignment is made during the input of an individual TCTO to the JCALS
     System. Additional data code numbers may be required for supplemental kit identification.
     Data codes are indexed in REMIS.
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                 73


4.4. Preparation, Review, and Control of Formal TCTOs.
   4.4.1. Identifying Requirements and Funding. Modification proposals are
   documented on AF IMTs 1067, Modification Proposal, and must be technically validated
   by the responsible PM organization. Validated AF IMTs 1067 are submitted to the Lead
   Command, where they are prioritized and approved by a Command Configuration Review
   (CCR) Board. The command will issue a PMD with funding for the approved modification
   proposal, which is submitted to the PM for action. The PM or prime contractor generates an
   ECP to document the required configuration changes and the modification implementation
   approach, and submits the ECP to the PM CCB for approval. Approved ECPs provide the
   authorization to develop TCTOs and incorporate configuration changes into Technical
   Orders.
   4.4.2. Organically-Prepared TCTOs.
      4.4.2.1. Modifications driven by contractor ECPs or MAJCOM PMDs will be
      authorized by the PM CCB in accordance with AFI 63-1101, and documented on an
      AF IMT 3525. Internal SPO-determined needs for one-time inspections, modifications,
      or software updates will require assignment of a material improvement project (MIP)
      number and initiation of an AF IMT 3525 for CCB approval in accordance with AF1 63-
      1101. NOTE: For low-cost permanent modifications (under $10M), an AF IMT 1067
      may be used in lieu of the AF IMT 3525.
      4.4.2.2. The responsible CCB processes the AF IMT 3525 to document approval or
      disapproval of the modification. If the modification is disapproved, the AF IMT 3525 is
      returned to the initiator. If the modification is approved, the CCB will determine how it
      should be performed [ECP, Engineering Order (EO), or TCTO], and the CCB
      chairperson signs the form. Changes to Computer Resource Configured Items (CRCI)
      are not controlled by TCTOs, but Computer Program Identification Number (CPIN)
      software changes can be distributed using a TCTO. Permanent modifications to
      hardware are processed according to the Defense Acquisition Guidebook
      (http://akss.dau.mil/dag/).
      4.4.2.3. The TCM initiates AFMC IMTs 873 and 875 for all approved TCTOs
      (paragraphs 4.13 and 4.15).
      4.4.2.4. The TO Manager requests a TCTO number through the JCALS ―Assign a
      TCTO Number‖ function, and the next sequential number in the TCTO Series is
      automatically assigned by the JCALS System. The TO Manager overrides the system
      assigned Data Code and assigns new numbers from a block of Data Codes provided to the
      PM by OC-ALC/LGLUB.
      4.4.2.5. When development of the TCTO has progressed to the point where the parts
      affected and kit requirements can be determined, the TCM preparing the TCTO initiates
      an AFMC IMT 874 (paragraph 4.14). The AFMC IMT 874 is required when TCTO
      kits or special tools/test equipment are required, when spares are impacted, and/or when
      parts are added or removed. An AFMC IMT 874 is only required for inspection TCTOs if
      kits, special tools, etc., not commonly available at the performing units are required..
      4.4.2.6. The TCM preparing the TCTO also initiates the JCALS ―Recommend a TM
      Change‖ and ―Prepare TM Change Package‖ functions (Chapter 3) to update each TO
74                                                      AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


        affected by the modification. The recommended change - will identify the TCTO being
        supported and will specify the distribution date required to ensure concurrent release.
        4.4.2.7. After completion of the AFMC IMT 874 (when required), the TCM prepares the
        body of the TCTO in accordance with MIL-PRF-38804.
        4.4.2.8. The PMA will assemble a TCTO history folder containing the below documents.
        The history folder will be retained by the PMA after completion of the TCTO for the life
        cycle of the system or commodity affected.
           - AF IMTs 1067 or 3525,
           - Draft TCTO,
           - JCALS ―Recommend a TM Change‖ and ―Prepare TM Change Package‖ screens,
           - AFMC IMT 133, Interchangeability and Substitutability Program,
           - Print-out of completed web-based form 513, TCTO I&S Notification (see 4.7.6.),
           - AFMC IMTs 873, 874 & 875 (as applicable), and
           - AFTO IMT 82.
        4.4.2.9. The PMA requests a Pre-Release Review Group (PRRG) meeting (if required)
        with the TCM, TO Manager and other affected activities to ensure all actions have been
        completed for concurrent release of the TCTO, any kits involved, and any required TO
        updates. The TCTO rescission period is determined at the meeting. After the meeting,
        the PMA or TCM submits the draft TCTO and associated JCALS ―Prepare TM Change
        Package‖ - work folders to the TO Manager for preparation of formal drafts. The TCM
        and TO Manager perform a pre-publication quality check of the draft, and submit it for
        publication and distribution.
     4.4.3. Contractor Prepared TCTOs:
        4.4.3.1. As with locally-prepared TCTOs (paragraph 4.4.2), modifications must be
        approved by the CCB. The TCM initiates the AFMC IMTs 873 and 875. The
        applicable ALC TO Manager completes the JCALS ―Manage TM Numbering; Assign a
        Publication Number (AF TCTO Publications)‖ process, and reviews and signs the
        completed forms.
        4.4.3.2. The responsible data manager (DM) forwards an e-mail to all affected
        organizations (other PMs and affected TO Managers, program engineering, etc.),
        requesting identification of all data requirements for the TCTO. The DM may request
        responses on DD Forms 1423, Contract Data Requirements List, or AF IMTs 585,
        Contract Data Requirements Substantiation, but usually accepts inputs via e-mail.
        The DM provides the proper backup material [ECP, purchase request (PR), etc.] when
        available.
        4.4.3.3. In response to the DM-issued data call, affected TO Managers develop the
        TO data requirements to support the changes to assigned military systems,
        commodities or embedded items. TO Managers will not prepare TO data requirements
        for TOs prime at other ALCs and will not prepare TO data requirements for military
        systems or commodities not submitted through the DM of the center responsible for the
        items.
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                 75


          4.4.3.3.1. Example: I. For an SPD-managed modification involving airborne
          equipment, SE prime in a collocated PGM division, and other commodities prime at
          other centers, TO data requirements are generated through three channels:
              - From the SPD DM-prepared data call submitted directly to the TO Manager.
              The TO data requirements support the military system or commodity and the
              TOs for which the SPD is responsible.
              - From the DM in the Product Group responsible for affected SE, who upon receipt
              of the SPD data call, issued a data call. TO Managers responsible for TOs
              supporting the affected SE will prepare and submit requirements in response
              to the data call. The data requirements are screened by the SE PGM DM and
              forwarded to the SPD DM; and;
              - From the non-collocated DMs whose centers are prime on other commodities
              affected by the TCTO. Upon receipt of the data call, the non-collocated DM
              also issues a data call to local support organizations and TO Managers. The DM
              submits the center data requirements to the SPD DM.
              II. The SPD DM combines all data requirements, forwarding the combined DD
              Forms 1423 to the PMA for attachment to the PR. Under emergency conditions,
              the DM issues the data call and combines the CDRL while the PR is being
              processed. The DM ensures the CDRL is provided to the buyer.
      4.4.3.4. Once the contract for the TCTO is signed, the contractor will complete an
      AFMC IMT 874 (if required) according to paragraph 4.14, based on data on the AFMC
      IMT 873, and forward the forms to the PMA for coordination and approval.
      4.4.3.5. Contractors will submit proposed associated TO Changes according to
      contract provisions.
      4.4.3.6. When a TCTO is contractor-prepared and verification is accomplished
      elsewhere, the PM will forward a copy of the completed AFTO IMT 82 to the
      Contracting Officer (CO -- includes either the ACO or PCO) within 30 days. Forward
      any deficiencies noted during verification through the CO to the contractor so
      corrective action may be completed prior to TCTO and kit acceptance.
4.5. Coordination of Formal TCTOs.
   4.5.1. PM Coordination. A TCTO prepared by a PGM or TCM responsible for an
   imbedded commodity is coordinated with the SPD responsible for the affected aircraft,
   missile, or C-E end item and vice versa. SPDs control the space within a system or end item
   allocated for the installation of new components. When more than one PGM desires the use
   of a specified space within a system or end item, the SPD is the controlling agency and acts
   as an arbitrator where complications of space usage occur. Two copies of the TCTO draft
   are forwarded to the SPD engineering activity (D086, Mission Workload Assignments
   System) for engineering coordination. Exceptions for interim immediate and urgent TCTOs
   are specified in TO 00-5-15.
   4.5.2. Other Coordination. One copy of each TCTO is forwarded to the following
   activities for coordination on the matters indicated:
        - MAJCOM/LGM for O- or I-level TCTOs in accordance with TO 00-5-15.
        - BEE (at the nearest USAF hospital) when use of the following or similar materials
76                                                   AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005

     - AFCESA/CEXF for all requirements related to aircraft fire prevention, egress
     safety, and emergency rescue (see paragraph 1.8.).
     - Center/Base Safety Office when publications or procedures expose personnel to
     hazardous environmental or operational factors which require a review, technical
     evaluation for ground, weapons, explosive, flying, or system safety, and safety office
     approval of the proposed TO and updates.
     - AAC/NWLT when the TCTO affects radioactive material used in Nuclear Weapons.
     - The USAF Radioisotope Committee Secretariat, HQ AFMOA/SGPR, 8901 18th St,
     Brooks AFB TX 78235-5217 (through HQ AFMC/SGBR), when a TCTO has
     information or instructions concerning other radioactive materials (e.g., depleted
     uranium counterweights, luminous exit markers, optical lens coatings containing
     thorium, or nucleonic fuel indicators). See AFI 40-201.
     - The prime ALC NDI manager or other ALC organization designated to provide
     Level III NDI services, or corrosion control manager when TCTOs have instructions
     relating to, or a requirement for, NDI or corrosion control treatment. The Air Force
     OPRs for NDI and corrosion control are AFRL/ MLS-OL (4750 Staff Dr, Tinker AFB
     OK 73145-3317) and AFRL/MLS-OLR (325 2nd St Bldg 165, Robins AFB GA
     31098-1639), respectively.
     - Detachment 63, AAC/WMO when the TCTO could modify the below-listed items in
     ANY way:
         - Bombs and warheads.
         - Fuzes and fuzing systems.
         - Guided and ballistic missiles.
        -Missiles, grenades artillery, mortar, rocket, and small arms ammunition.
        - Mines, depth charges and torpedoes.
        - Demolition charges and pyrotechnics.
        - Dispensers and clusters.
        - Cartridge and propellant-actuated devices (such as aircraft egress systems).
        - Aircraft weapons/munitions delivery systems.
        - Any item which contains (high or low) explosives, propellant, or hazardous
        chemicals which may cause injury/death to personnel or damage to equipment.
     - Any affected SAP/FMS program monitors.
     - All TCTOs are coordinated with and a copy is provided to the responsible program
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                   77


         configuration management activity for input into the applicable configuration
         management system.
4.6. Release of TCTO Kits and Technical Data. An AFMC IMT 875 must be completed
according to the instructions in paragraph 4.15 prior to the release of a TCTO, kits, and related
TO updates. Release of TCTO concurrently with the release of the TCTO kit is Air Force policy
and is the responsibility of the PM.
4.7. Publishing TCTOs.
   4.7.1. AFTO IMT 82. An AFTO IMT 82 is completed on all TCTOs after
   verification, listing required corrections. The form is forwarded to the contractor, if the
   TCTO was contractor-prepared, for incorporation before the prepublication review and
   publication. For organic TCTOs, the form is sent to the TCM for correction of the draft.
   4.7.2. Pre-Release Review Group (PRRG). After necessary corrections have been made
   and it is ready for publication, the PMA requests a PRRG meeting to ensure all
   requirements for concurrent release of the TCTO, kits, and TO updates have been met prior
   to submitting the package to the TO Manager for publishing. Each TCTO is reviewed for
   technical content, accuracy, completeness, practicality, RGL and compliance with the latest
   version of MIL-PRF-38804. The PRRG, in coordination with the TO Manager, establishes
   the TCTO rescission date based on risk mitigation analysis. The date will be entered into
   JCALS using the ―Update an Index Entry‖ process . The package for contractor-developed
   TCTOs will be submitted when final reproduction masters are ready for delivery. The
   complete data package has:
       4.7.2.1. The digital reproduction master, including all artwork and illustrations. Digital
       reproduction masters should either be a page image file such as Adobe PDF™ or a
       protected word processor document, and must be accompanied by a paper copy to verify
       formatting information.
       4.7.2.2. A copy of the AFMC IMT 875 with PM certification.
       4.7.2.3. A signed copy of the completed AFMC IMT 873.
       4.7.2.4. A signed copy of the completed AFMC IMT 874; required if a TCTO needs
       kits and/or special tools and test equipment, affects supply spares, adds components to
       the modified item, or if removed parts and components require disposition instructions.
       The form is also required for TCTOs which would normally require kits, but which
       have received a waiver to the complete kit concept, to document supply status and
       parts usage. An AFMC IMT 874 is only required for inspection TCTOs if kits, special
       tools/test equipment, etc., not commonly available at the performing units are required.
       NOTE: When new AFMC IMTs 873, 874, or 875 are initiated for a TCTO supplement,
       complete only the blocks changed from the original form.
       4.7.2.5. JCALS ―Prepare TM Change Package‖ screens with appropriate TO updates as
       required.
       4.7.2.6. Completed AFTO IMTs 124 for the TCTO and each TO update (if required).
       4.7.2.7. A fund citation.
78                                                          AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


     4.7.3. Illustrations. When line drawings are unavailable for use in an organically-
     developed TCTO, the initiator furnishes black and white unscreened glossy photographs
     for each illustration. Photographs should not be marked or defaced in any manner; required
     corrections are marked on a copy of the photograph or on an overlay.
     4.7.4. Reproducible Copy. For organically-developed TCTOs, the TO Manager oversees
     preparation of the reproducible copy and ensures the TCTO is printed with the priority
     required by the urgency of the TCTO. Technical changes to TCTO drafts which have been
     submitted for publication are made only with the consent of the responsible TCM. Any
     editorial changes must be coordinated with the TCM before printing and distribution of the
     TCTO.
     4.7.5. Reproduction Quality Check. The TO Manager will review initial printed copies
     of TCTOs immediately upon receipt to ensure there are no printing errors.
     4.7.6. ―513‖ Procedures. When the item being modified requires re-identification, the
     TCM completes an on-line form 513 concurrently with the distribution of the TCTO to
     affected activities, in accordance with AFMCMAN 23-3, Cataloging and Standardization.
     The form 513 is available at https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/LG/lgi-
     page/lgis/Form513_index.htm, and will be completed and submitted on line to the
     AFMC Logistics Information Division, AFMC LSO/ LGISA, Battle-Creek MI. In
     completing the form, the TCM will:
          - Check the ―MOD REQUIRED BEFORE ISSUE‖ block as ―NO‖ if the unmodified
          and modified items are acceptable for use, pending completion of the TCTO
          requirements.
          - Print "END ITEM MOD" in the shaded area adjacent to the entry of ―NSN after
          modification‖ if the TCTO requires the end item to be modified to accept the modified
          item.
          - Complete all portions of the form.
          - Provide updates when a TCTO is extended or reinstated. NOTE: In most cases,
          modified items are not re-identified, but are given new NSNs/part numbers
          through the ―Base 86‖ process (paragraph 4.14.3.4.). If all of the assets are being
          modified, the pre-modification NSN/part number will be rescinded after modification
          completion.
     4.7.7. Post-Publication Reviews. The need for post-publication reviews and the
     frequency of such reviews is determined by the TCM in conjunction with the TCTO
     user. Factors to be considered include the type of TCTO (immediate, urgent, routine,
     record), changes to the system or commodity being modified, and accumulation of problem
     reports.
4.8. TCTO Control Records.
     4.8.1. Materiel Improvement Project (MIP) Status System (G081). T h e A LC
     p r e p a r i n g t h e TCTO is responsible for maintaining a complete chronological record using
     the MIP Status System.
     4.8.2. Schedules. For contractor-performed TCTOs, the PM managing the TCTO is
     responsible for maintaining a TCTO completion schedule prepared by the contractor as
     required by the contract. The schedule also shows the estimated delivery date of TCTO
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                 79


   reproducible master to the Air Force. A copy of the schedule is furnished to the TO
   Manager.
4.9. TCTO Rescission. See TO 00-5-15 for procedures.
   NOTES:
   1. AAC/NWLT complies with local operating instructions for Nuclear Weapons TOs.
   2. Consortium or other cost sharing agreements may require coordination through the
   appropriate AFSAC office prior to rescission of TCTOs and the removal of "before"
   modification data.
   4.9.1. Monitoring Rescission Dates. TO Managers must periodically use the JCALS
   ―Perform Post Publication Review‖ function to generate a listing of assigned TCTOs and
   monitor rescission dates. Any TCTOs within 150 days of rescission will be identified to
   the TCM and PMA for review. The PMA will recommend that the TO Manager either
   rescind the TCTO or extend the Rescission Date in the JCALS Pub Index, based on
   compliance status.
   4.9.2. Initial TO Manager Procedures. If the TCTO will be rescinded, the TO Manager
   must take action to prevent any further reprinting action, provide the PM with timely notice
   for pre-rescission evaluation and processing of required control documentation within the
   allotted time frames, and alert using commands and SAP countries to review compliance
   status of TCTOs. The TO Manager notifies the PMA that the TCTO is nearing rescission.
   4.9.3. Production Management. The PMA will:
      4.9.3.1. Review applicable TCTO configuration management data for modification
      completion status. If the modification is complete, determine the number and location of
      any excess modification kits, and initiate disposal as prescribed by AFMAN 23-110. If
      the modification is not complete, obtain the status and commitment for modification
      completion from each performing organization. Initiate action to extend the rescission
      date or complete the TCTO within the remaining time.
      4.9.3.2. Determine if any TOs or other active TCTOs will be affected by the rescission
      and initiate appropriate action.
      4.9.3.3. When disposition of items in Air Force stock is affected, coordinate with the
      appropriate PM to ensure that all required actions have been completed. Obtain approval
      from the PM requirements office for TCTO rescission (supply actions are complete) or
      a commitment to complete TCTO-directed actions for disposition of items.
      4.9.3.4. Determine if the rescission is applicable to both Air Force and SAP countries
      (see paragraph 4.9.6.1).
      4.9.3.5. Based on the above data, determine if the TCTO is to be rescinded or the
      rescission date extended. Rescission date extension requires justification and approval
      (same approval authority as the basic TCTO). Any decision to extend a TCTO or allow
      it to rescind must be accompanied by funds to publish either the extension or the related
      TO update(s) to remove ―before‖ data.
80                                                       AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


        4.9.3.6. If the TCTO is to be rescinded and there are excess modification kits, the PMA
        will coordinate through program engineering to initiate excess AF property disposal
        procedures prescribed by AFMAN 23-110, Vol III, Pt One, Chapter 11.
        4.9.3.7. Submit the recommended TCTO rescission action to the PM division chief for
        approval no later than 110 days before the scheduled rescission date.
        4.9.3.8. Within 2 workdays after PM division chief approval and not later than 90 days
        prior to rescission date, the PMA notifies the TO Manager by cover letter and updates
        the rescission date in REMIS.
     4.9.4. Follow-on TO Manager Procedures. Upon production management notification,
     the TO Manager takes action to either rescind the TCTO on the scheduled date or to extend
     the rescission date in the JCALS Index. If the TCTO will rescind, the TO Manager will verify
     that ―before data‖ has been removed from all affected TOs, or schedule data removal during
     the next routine update to affected TOs.
        4.9.4.1. To prevent complete rescission of TCTOs still usable by SAP countries, the TO
        Manager uses the JCALS ―Manage TM Numbering; Rescind a TM‖ process to rescind
        the TCTO for Air Force units only. OC-ALC/LGLUF will be notified to include the
        TCTO in the applicable TO 0-1-71 index. The TCTO records are transferred from
        JCALS to SATODS.
        4.9.4.2. An immediate, urgent, or routine action safety TCTO rescinded for USAF
        use but retained for SAP will not be downgraded in criticality when transferred to the
        TO 0-1-71 index.
        4.9.4.3. A compliance period appropriate for correcting the deficiencies will be
        assigned. If the compliance period exceeds the limits outlined in TO 00-5-15, Table 2-1,
        for any reason, the PM or ES will notify the country regarding the status, the reason for
        the delay, the estimated correction date, and any interim actions the country can take to
        ensure safe operation of the system or commodity.
4.10. Early Rescission of TCTOs.
     4.10.1. Criteria. Use the following criteria for deciding to rescind a TCTO before the
     rescission date:
     - The information has been replaced by or included in another TO or TCTO, or
     - The TCTO procedure is obsolete, or
     - Further compliance with the TCTO is not desirable, or
     - Configuration accounting records indicate compliance with the TCTO, or
     - The TCM or PMA verifies compliance has been completed on both installed assets and all
     affected spares, or
     - Coordination with the AFSAC office verifies consortium or FMS support agreements have
     been satisfied, and kits have been delivered or are available.
     4.10.2. Coordination and Approval. TCTO Manager requests for early rescission are
     submitted to the proper PM division chief, clearly stating the reasons for rescinding and
     documenting that all necessary coordination has been completed.
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                      81


       4.10.2.1. The request for TCTO rescission is coordinated with the TCTO kit supply
       organization. The rescission of a TCTO will not be approved if items requiring
       compliance before use are in stock, unless a written commitment for completion of
       TCTO directed actions has been received from the PM activity.
       4.10.2.2. After rescission approval by the proper PM division chief, the rescission
       approval and date are forwarded by letter from the PMA to the TO Manager to take
       rescission action. The notification indicates if rescission is for Air Force only or includes
       the SAP.
   4.10.3. Emergency Suspension/Abeyance. TO 00-5-15 has procedures for emergency
   suspension when there are serious problems with TCTO compliance. TCTO suspension is
   called ―Abeyance.‖ TCTOs cannot be held in abeyance past the rescission date, and cannot be
   extended unless the suspension has been lifted. Suspended Interim TCTOs must either be
   rescinded or released for compliance after 90 days.
4.11. Reinstatement of Rescinded TCTOs.
   4.11.1. Procedures. Reinstate rescinded TCTOs in accordance with TO 00-5-15, by
   replacement with a new TCTO. The TCM will determine if there is sufficient justification
   for reinstatement of the TCTO. If a manageable quantity of found on base assets are
   unmodified after TCTO rescission, official reinstatement may not be necessary; rather the
   PMA can authorize the accomplishment of the rescinded TCTO by letter. If a large quantity
   of assets is involved, issue of a new TCTO is mandatory.
   4.11.2. Approval. Rescinded configuration change TCTOs may only be reinstated by
   approval of the responsible CCB, using an AF IMT 3525. Requests for reinstatement are
   submitted through the CCB executive secretary. Reinstatement of non-configuration change
   TCTOs is approved by the appropriate PM division chief.
   4.11.3. Reissue. When reinstatement has been approved, issue the TCTO in accordance
   with TO 00-5-15. When a TCTO has been reinstated and special management action is
   required in the supply area, the PMA ensures all affected PMs are notified.
4.12. Extension of Rescission Dates.
   4.12.1. Approval to Rescind. TCTO rescission dates cannot be extended without prior
   approval of the responsible PM Division Chief. Requests for extension are submitted by
   letter no later than 110 days before the scheduled rescission date to allow updating of
   REMIS and JCALS, and publishing a TCTO supplement if applicable. In all cases,
   adherence with TO 00-5-15 guidance is mandatory.
   4.12.2. Updating REMIS. Within 2 workdays after CCB or PM approval, and not later
   than 90 days prior to the rescission date, the PMA updates REMIS (see TO 00-5-15), and

            required signatures are present.
            4.14.4.12.2. For contractor-prepared TCTOs, the contractor will sign the form
            before returning it to the government for review and approval. After approval, any
            differences from the contractor-submitted data will be resolved and the approved
            form will be returned to the contractor to permit initiation of TCTO development.
            4.14.4.12.3. Unless otherwise specified on the form by the preparing contractor,
            government-furnished property (GFP) equipment and supplies required to support
            TCTO accomplishment will be shipped directly to the contractor facility. GFP which
            will NOT be included in TCTO kits must be clearly identified.
4.15. AFMC IMT 875 Completion and Processing.
     4.15.1. General. The AFMC IMT 875 is a programming document to ensure concurrent
     availability of all support for a TCTO (companion TCTOs, related TO updates, special tools
     and equipment, and kits). The document is used to identify and coordinate the relevant
     logistics actions to ensure the maximum effectiveness of TCTO completion.
        4.15.1.1. The PM organization which will manage the TCTO initiates the AFMC IMT
        875 after CCB approval of the TCTO. The responsible TCM determines which items are
        applicable based on information provided by the AF IMT 3525 and AFMC IMT
        873, and marks the ―Action Required‖ blocks on the AFMC IMT 875. The TCM then
        signs off any completed actions in the ‗Action Required‘ blocks and forwards the form,
        accompanied by the AF IMT 3525, to the applicable PMA to guide the management and
        programming of the TCTO.
        4.15.1.2. The PMA will monitor and control the accomplishment of actions,
        coordination, and approvals required by the tailored AFMC IMT 875. Once all logistics
        support actions required by the form have been completed, the PMA signs off the
        completed items in the ‗Action Completed‖ blocks, signs the form and forwards it to the
        PM for signature authorizing release of the TCTO. After the printed material is ready for
        distribution, it is forwarded with the rest of the TCTO package to the TO Manager for
        publishing the TCTO and any required TO updates.
     4.15.2. Form Retention. Copies of the completed form are provided to the responsible
     TCM and the kit monitor as authority for release of the TCTO. The PMA maintains a copy of
     the form in the project folder until completion of the TCTO, after which it will be maintained
     in a TCTO history folder by the PMA for the life of the system.
     4.15.3. Instructions for Completion of the AFMC IMT 875.
        4.15.3.1. Heading Information.

                                           Chapter 5

ENGINEERING DISPOSITION FOR NONCONFORMING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS
                 BEYOND PUBLISHED AUTHORITY

5.1. General. This chapter prescribes policy and procedures for Air Force depot-level activities
to request and furnish technical data for equipment troubleshooting and repair procedures
beyond existing TO authority (TO 00-5-1), under work stoppage and anticipated work stoppage
conditions (see glossary), at all ALCs, Product Centers, AMARC and AFMETCAL, Det 1.
Depot field teams (organic or contractor) may either use the AFMC IMT 202 process or the TO
00-25-107/-108 Maintenance Assistance processes, whichever is more appropriate under the
circumstances. The AFMC IMT 202 process will NOT be used instead of the TO 00-25-107/-
108 processes to assist field-level activities. If the AFMC IMT 202 process request specifies an
item on the Master Nuclear Certification Listing
(https://wwwmil.nwc.kirtland.af.mil/mncl/index.cfm), check guidance in AFI 91-101 and
AFMAN 91-221 to see if a DULL SWORD report is required. If a DULL SWORD report is
required, report IAW AFMAN 91-221 chapter 1.4.5.


   5.1.1. Those weapon system program managers who convert their organizations to an
   integrated Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system may use that system in lieu of the
   AFMC-Form-202, and may require the use of that system by the depot units that maintain
   that weapon system. The procedures for using that system shall be documented by the using
   organization, shall accomplish the intent of the AFMC Form 202 process, and shall be
   approved by the HQ AFMC/A4 Technical Director.
5.2. Forms Used.
   5.2.1. AFMC Form 202. Initiate the AFMC Form 202 within a depot-level maintenance
   activity to request the responsible engineer to develop technical data or determine
   serviceability when published data is not adequate to complete the task at hand. Also use the
   AFMC Form 202 to alleviate parts or material shortages by authorizing substitutes
   determined suitable by the responsible program engineers. Prepare the AFMC Form 202
   according to paragraph 5.7. DO NOT use the AFMC Form 202 to initiate routine corrective
   updates to TOs (see TO 00-5-1).
   5.2.2. Special Handling 252 (SH252) (AFMC IMT 252 – see Chapter 3). An AFMC
   IMT 252, fully-coordinated and approved IAW Chapter 3, is issued to provide the
   corrected or newly developed data necessary to resolve an actual or anticipated work
   stoppage when the applicable TO is in error or inadequate. Stamp or type ―Special
   Handling‖ on the top of each AFMC IMT 252 authorized for implementation. An
   alternative method is to enter ―AUTHORIZED FOR SPECIAL HANDLING‖ in block
   17 of the form. The approved SH252 is authorized for use at the depot facility until receipt of
   a formal TO update incorporating the data. DO NOT issue SH252s to implement routine
   corrective updates to TOs that do not prevent completion of the task at hand, or when the
   formal TO update will become available prior to the anticipated work stoppage.
       5.2.2.1. The responsible Engineer or Equipment Specialist shall ensure the SH252 is
       routed to the applicable TO Manager for processing, (see paragraph 5.5.7), the SH252 is
94                                                       AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


        stamped and/or typed ―Special Handling‖ on the top of the 252 or in block 17/18 and if
        applicable all attachments, block 5 has a project number assigned (if applicable, project
        number shall be annotated on all attachments), all required signatures are on the SH252,
        and if applicable, an approved and completed AFMC Form 202 is attached to the
        SH252‖.
        5.2.2.2. The responsible Engineer or Equipment Specialist will provide the approved and
        completed SH252 to any affected areas using approved distribution processes. The
        responsible planner for the workload will provide a copy of the SH252 to the TODO for
        posting. Under the Standard Depot Maintenance Process (SDMP) the responsible
        production support organization will ensure the SH 252 package is provided to the
        TODO.‖
     5.2.3. AF IMTs 3925 and 3926 & 3927, Engineering Order (EO) and Engineering
     Order (Continuation Sheet). An EO is used to document changes to engineering
     drawings or to parts (with or without a change to the drawings of the parts). When the
     solution to the problem reported on an AFMC IMT 202 is an engineering drawing
     change, complete and expedite processing of the EO according to AFI 21-402,
     Engineering Drawing System, and attach a copy to the AFMC IMT 202 returned to
     maintenance. An EO is optional when there is no drawing change required, provided an
     entry is made in the equipment history (AFTO IMT 95 or equivalent).
     5.2.4. AFTO IMTs 22. These forms shall be used in a depot-level activity to identify TO
     deficiencies or enhancements that do not prevent completion of the task at hand. They will
     be submitted IAW TO 00-5-1. They can only be implemented by a published TO update.
5.3. Automated Systems.
     5.3.1. Automated AFMC IMT 202 Applications. HQ AFMC/LG maintains a list of
     applications which have been reviewed and found compliant with processes and procedures
     in this manual. Maintenance organizations may either use the AFMC IMT 202 (see
     paragraph 5.7) or applications from the approved list. The approved
     applications list and center engineering focal point list are located at
     https://techdata.wpafb.af.mil/toprac/interim.htm. Maintenance organizations making a
     major change to an approved application or desiring to use an application not on the
     approved list, should contact their center engineering focal point to arrange for a process
     compliance review.
        5.3.1.1. No new systems shall be developed or deployed. An AFMC standard system
        will replace all existing dedicated 202 systems.
        5.3.1.2. Use of an automated system does not eliminate the requirement to accept and
        process AFMC IMTs 202 submitted using a manual process.
     5.3.2. Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (JCALS)
     System. JCALS is the automated TO system currently authorized for Air Force-wide use. As
     such, JCALS RC processes and procedures may be used when they meet or can be adapted to
     meet the requirements of the SH252 portion of the AFMC IMT 202 process (see below).
     5.3.3. JCALS Special Handling Recommended Change (SHRC). The engineer may use a
     JCALS RC instead of the AFMC Form 252 to develop and provide TO updates in
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                  95


   conjunction with an AFMC Form 202. Local, Center-level procedures will be developed to
   adapt the JCALS process to the AFMC Form 202/SH252 process in this chapter. SHRCs
   follow the same procedures and have the same authority and restrictions as an SH252.
   JCALS RCs do not replace the AFMC Form 202 itself.
5.4. Business Practices and Guidance. Engineering instructions provided on or with the
AFMC Form 202 must be strictly adhered to, and adherence must be verifiable in process and
upon completion of assigned work. AFMC Form s 202 cannot be changed, altered or reinstated
once they have been accepted by maintenance. If changes are required, new forms must be
initiated. Evaluate the deficiency, develop/revise tech data when required, and coordinate and
approve the AFMC Form 202 within 5 workdays after IET/Planner approval (block 3) for a work
stoppage condition. Complete the actions within 15 workdays for an anticipated work stoppage
condition. If a solution cannot be evaluated and completed within the specified time limits, the
requesting facility must be contacted and provided the intended course of action and expected
resolution date within the required time limit. The responsible engineer will either attach or
reference sketches, drawings and other documents to the AFMC Form 202 when determined
appropriate. Annotate the AFMC Form 202 control number in the upper right corner of all
physical attachments to maintain package integrity. Include links to information in other
databases or forms (drawings, electronic TOs, etc.) in a digital AFMC Form 202, when
appropriate. A fully coordinated and approved SH252 or AF Form 3925 will supersede the work
stoppage or anticipated work stoppage AFMC Form 202 which generated it. See Figure 5.1,
AFMC Form 202 Process Flow.
   5.4.1. Restriction. Use of any informal method to request or receive technical assistance
   is NOT authorized.
   5.4.2. Purpose. Use the AFMC IMT 202 to furnish technical data (a) for conditions or
   procedures beyond published authority under work-stoppage and anticipated work stoppage
   conditions, and (b) when technical data does not exist and must be developed, approved,
   and provided to maintenance technicians. Specifically, issue the AFMC IMT 202 to:
   - Provide procedures and engineering authorization for restoration of damaged or worn
   parts and components to serviceable condition through repair or overhaul procedures or
   processes not covered by applicable TOs, drawings or other technical data. NOTE: If the
   AFMC IMT 202 recommends a procedure which is subsequently adopted as a standard
   practice for system or component repair, the initiator (block 15) may be eligible to submit
   the procedure as an after-the-fact idea. No other uses of the form are eligible for the IDEA
   program. The initiator must submit the change and document the expected benefits in the
   IDEA Program Data System (IPDS). The IDEA submitter will retain a copy of the
   approved AFMC IMT 202 package as back-up justification material until IDEA
   disposition. Benefits must be confirmed by the TCM/IDEA evaluator using the IPDS.
   - Provide engineering determination of a ―Use-as-is‖ or ―Satisfactory-as-is‖ condition;
   - Provide engineering authorization for a one-time substitution of parts, components, or
   materials determined to be suitable replacements for specified items; and
   - Provide engineering authorization for a one-time substitution of SE, special tools, test
   equipment, fixtures or ground handling equipment determined to be suitable replacements
   for specified items.
96                                                      AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


     5.4.3. Limitations. AFMC Forms 202 must not degrade reliability, performance, form, fit or
     function beyond acceptable limits as determined by the Chief Engineer (or designee). The
     forms will not be used:
        5.4.3.1. As an interim TO pending receipt of a formal TO;
        5.4.3.2. As authorization for part or material substitution unless there is a critical
        shortage and the item is needed urgently to prevent maintenance or modification work
        stoppage;
        5.4.3.3. As a change to the intent of a TCTO or to extend rescission dates or reinstate
        rescinded TCTOs;
        5.4.3.4. To change nuclear certified equipment, systems or technical data unless
        authorized by the responsible Chief Engineer (or designee); or
        5.4.3.5. To change TMDE requirements specified in TOs 00-20-14 and 33K-1-100.
     5.4.4. Joint Service TMs. To implement new depot procedures/requirements, provided
     by other DoD components responsible for Joint Service Technical Manuals, use an SH252
     as the cover sheet for the other component‘s change package.
5.5. Responsibilities. NOTE: Each Center may designate alternate methods for accomplishing
the functions listed in this section, unless specifically assigned to a functional office.
     5.5.1. Maintenance Supervisor.

     5.5.6.1. The chief engineer exercises engineering approval authority for the PM/SCM.
     The chief engineer may delegate engineering approval authority for specific areas of
     responsibility (in writing) to one or more individuals. The delegated PM EAA signing an
     AFMC Form 202 must not be the same engineer who developed the procedures on that
     form.
     5.5.6.2. When the maintenance activity is not located at the center having engineering
     authority, the PM/SCM EAA may delegate authority (in writing) to engineers at the
     maintenance location to develop Part B instructions.
     5.5.6.3. The PM/SCM EAA verifies and approves instructions developed in Part B,
     verifies that required coordination (e.g., Safety, Bio-Environmental, and TO Manager)
     has been obtained, and signs block 26E.

     TO, not to exceed 365 days from the date the Special Handling AFMC Form 252 is
     received by the TO manager. If an AFMC Form 202 is attached to the SH252 the TO
     manager will ensure block 24 is marked TO change and then sign block 26D.
     5.5.7.2. Incorporate a supersedure notice on the TO title page listing superseded SH252
     project/local control numbers incorporated with the recommended change. After
     approving the SH252, the TO manager will provide a copy of the SH252 and, if
     applicable, attachments (AFMC Form 202, etc) back to the responsible Engineer for
     processing to the Depot production area (see paragraphs 5.2.2.1 and 5.2.2.2).
100                                                    AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


      5.5.7.3. Ensure each SH252 is incorporated in the next scheduled update to the affected
      TO, not to exceed 365 days from the date the AFMC IMT 252 is signed. However, the
      approved SH252 remains valid until receipt of an interim or formal TO update
      incorporating the data, no matter how long the time period. List any superseded SH252
      project/local control numbers on the title page of the formal TO update incorporating the
      recommended change.
   5.5.8. Center/Base Safety Office and Bio-Environmental Engineering (BEE)
   Office. T h e C e n ter/Base Safety Office at the same center as the PM/SCM EAA will

   202 when required IAW paragraph 1.6.1.2, and sign block 26C.
   5.5.9. TO Distribution Office (TODO). Receive copies of extended use AFMC IMTs 202
   (rescission determined by block 23A) and SH252s and annotate the project/control numbers
   in the ATOMS records for affected TOs. Reproduce enough copies of the forms to file with
   each affected TO copy. Remove AFMC IMTs 202 when rescinded or completed. Remove
   SH252s when a TO update superseding the SH252 is received.
   5.5.10. Center Engineering Offices. Provide AFMC/LG with focal points to conduct
   process compliance reviews when center maintenance organizations make major changes
   to an approved automated AFMC IMT 202 applications or desire to use an application
   not on the approved list, IAW paragraph 5.3.1. Upon successful completion of the review,
   provide documentation so AFMC/LG can add the application to the approved list.
      5.5.10.1. Excluding Maintenance Wing ENs, each Wing EN (or designee) shall review
      the engineering direction which it provided on AFMC Form 202 requests by using the
      USI checklists quarterly. The Wing EN shall be responsible for implementing corrective
      actions for trends found during the review. Each Center EN shall annually review the
      results of the AFMC Form 202 quarterly reviews performed by the Wing ENs within that
      Center. The annual review shall be to identify trends within the Wings‘ quarterly
      reviews, and to verify that the Wings‘ quarterly reviews address all USI criteria. Each
      Maintenance Wing EN shall jointly review the AFMC FORM 202process with its local
      quality organization on a quarterly basis. All engineering reviews of the AFMC FORM
      202process shall be performed in accordance with AFMCI 90-202.

      documentation.
      5.5.12.2. (DELETED).
5.6. Procedures. (See Figure 5.1)
   5.6.1. Development and Approval.
      5.6.1.1. If the responsible engineer determines that the AFMC IMT 202 is not required
      (paragraph 5.5.5.2), mark block 22 on the form ―No Action Required,‖ enter ―N/A‖
      in block 23 (Rescind On), sign block 26A, and route the form through the EAA
      (block 26E) to the IET/Planner and Maintenance Supervisor (blocks 27 and 28).
      5.6.1.2. AFMC IMT 202 packages must contain orderly, clear, concise and complete
      step-by-step technical instructions for nonstandard work.
      5.6.1.3. The packages must contain warnings, cautions and notes as required by MIL-
      STD-38784 (format is not a requirement). Use warnings and cautions when failure to
      comply with instructions could result in injury to personnel or damage to equipment,
      unless the warnings and cautions are already contained in the attached or referenced
      TOs and drawings. When referencing warnings and cautions from the source document,
      the AFMC IMT 202 must cite the specific paragraph(s) referenced.
      5.6.1.4. If the solution requires a change to an engineering drawing, complete an AF
      IMT 3925, obtain a project number and attach a copy of the EO to the AFMC IMT 202
      providing the solution. Forward the original EO for processing according to AFI 21-402.
      5.6.1.5. If the solution requires a TO change, prepare and coordinate an AFMC IMT 252
      according to Chapter 3, and print and sign a copy of the approved form. Stamp or print
      ―Special Handling‖ in bold letters at the top of each printed sheet of the form. Forward
      the package to the TO Manager for signature of the AFMC IMT 202 and processing the
      SH252 into a TO update.
      5.6.1.6. If TO or drawing changes are not required, the engineer enters the step-by-step
      procedures, waiver or other instructions in Part B of the AFMC Form 202. If
      maintenance requested a TO change the engineer will explain why a TO change is not
      required.
      5.6.1.7. Provide instructions in block 25 for documenting significant maintenance
      actions resulting in conditions that could have a bearing on future maintenance actions,
      and nonstandard repairs which will be readily apparent to field/owning organizations,
      instructions (TO 00-20-1). If future actions are required on aircraft, such as inspections or
      component replacement, an AFTO IMT 781 entry shall be made.
102                                                   AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


      5.6.1.8. All new or changed procedures must be verified prior to use. Verification will
      be performed in conjunction with maintenance and QA representatives, when their
      participation is requested.
   5.6.2. Distribution and Posting. The affected maintenance function supervisor will
   review the approved procedures for any compliance issues (lack of support equipment,
   supplies, training and skills of assigned personnel, etc.), and sign block 28 to authorize
   implementation.
      5.6.2.1. The AFMC IMT 202 is only authorized for extended use of a procedure
      modification or part substitution (also known as ―blanket authority‖) for a maximum
      period of performance of 120 days from the date approved by the PM Engineering
      Approval Authority (block 26E). A form written against a specific tail/serial numbered
      item or implementing a job directed by an AFMC IMT 206, Temporary Work
      Request, is only authorized until the specific task is completed. DO NOT complete both
      blocks 23A and 23B on an AFMC IMT 202. If the AFMC IMT 202 has a completed,
      approved SH252 or AF IMT 3925 attached, mark block 23A ―N/A.‖
      5.6.2.2. The IET/planner will forward extended use AFMC IMT 202 packages
      (rescission determined by block 23A), which do not require a TO change (no AFMC
      IMT 252 involved), to the TODO for reproduction and redistribution as required. The
      TODO will file these extended use, non-TO change AFMC IMTs 202 behind the related
      TO, annotate the TO title page with the form control number, and annotate each affected
      paragraph in the TO as if the form was a routine supplement.
      5.6.2.3. Attach a copy of approved ―one-time use‖ AFMC IMTs 202 (rescission
      determined by completion of the tail/serial/Rqst numbered item listed in block 23B) to
      the applicable work control documents (WCDs).
      5.6.2.4. The requirement to attach the AFMC Form 202 to the applicable WCD is
      waived when the WCD is maintained in the Inventory Tracking System (ITS), provided
      the approved forms are available to maintenance technicians in the immediate work area.
      When ―Blanket‖ AFMC Form 202s and SH252s approve the use of new tooling or
      equipment without changing maintenance processes, those control numbers will be
      posted with the technical data and are not required to be attached to the WCD. For cases
      where a TO is used by both depot and field units, an (Interim Operational Supplement)
      IOS will be issued instead of a SH252.
      5.6.2.5. Upon receipt, the TODO will reproduce enough copies of approved SH252s
      to allow posting behind every affected TO copy, annotate the SH252 project/local
      control number on the TO title pages, and annotate each affected paragraph in the TO as
      if the SH252 was a routine supplement. If attached AFTO IMTs 22 were referenced in
      an SH252 or a JCALS SHRC was used instead of an SH252, annotate AFTO IMT
      22/SHRC procedures to the affected TO paragraphs in the same manner. NOTE: Posting
      and annotating forms in digital TO files will be done IAW procedures in TO 00-5-1.
   5.6.3. Rescission and Removal. The TODO will remove extended-use, non-TO
   change AFMC IMTs 202 from TOs when the information is no longer required, when the
   established rescission date is reached, or upon receipt of a replacement form, whichever
   occurs first. Ensure that TO annotations driven by rescinded AFMC IMTs 202 are completely
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                 103


   erased. The TODO will remove an SH252 from the TO upon receipt of the TO update
   incorporating the data, or when replaced by a new SH252. Only authorized personnel can
   remove or add SH252s and AFMC IMTs 202 to depot technical orders.
   5.6.4. Review and Reissue. If the instructions on an AFMC IMT 202 are still required after
   the form rescission date, and a TO update or engineering drawing change is not appropriate, a
   new AFMC IMT 202 may be issued referencing the previous AFMC IMT 202. An AFMC
   IMT 202 shall not be reissued more than four times without submitting an RC against the
   affected TO or an EO against the affected drawing.
   5.6.5. Standardizing Procedures. When information in an AFMC Form 202 becomes a
   repeat requirement (for example, substitute equipment becomes standard or extended repair
   procedures become a repetitive requirement), the responsible engineer shall initiate a TO
   update or drawing change by submitting an AFMC Form 252 or EO, or by submitting other
   applicable documentation to permanently update other technical data.
   5.6.6. Documenting Repairs. Document repairs as required by the AFMC IMT 202, block
   25. When the DD Form 1574 on an item being installed lists such deviations, transfer the
   comments to the end item AFTO IMT 95 (if one exists) or 781-series form to preclude loss
   of data. After job completion, each applicable ‗one-time use‘ AFMC IMT 202 (along with
   the WCD) will be filed in affected end item historical files.
5.7. AFMC IMT 202, Completion Instructions. NOTE: The form is available in both IMT
and Word versions (see http://www.ide.wpafb.af.mil/toprac/to-syste.htm, ―Forms‖), and may

  CONTRACTOR FURNISHED AERONAUTICAL EQUIPMENT/CONTRACTOR
 FURNISHED EQUIPMENT (CFAE/CFE) NOTICE PROCESSING AND TRACKING
                         PROCEDURES

6.1. General. CFAE/CFE Notices (often called ―CFENs‖ for short) are submitted by
contractors when required by a CDRL item, or by other government agencies developing TOs for
the Air Force. The notices identify the purpose and use of specific technical manuals for the
operation, maintenance and inspection of equipment used with the end-item system or
commodity, and which are not already covered by the TO development contract. The manuals
may be MILSPEC TOs, commercial manuals, or contractor data developed for the
government.
   6.1.1. CFEN Content. CFEN content is specified by data item description (DID) DI-
   TMSS-80067. Notices should be checked to be sure all blocks are filled in (i.e., contract
   number and date, submitting contractor name and vendor code, publisher name and vendor
   code, stock number, configured item number, etc.) Incomplete or inaccurate notices
   should be returned to the contractor for corrective action. CFENs should be revised and
   resubmitted or superseded whenever the item represented under- goes significant change or
   data requirements change.
   6.1.2. National Stock Class (NSC). The NSC of the equipment covered is listed on the
   notice. The NSC is used with the D086, Mission Workload Assignments System, to
   determine which ALC is prime for the management of the commodity and manual involved.
   6.1.3. PM Procedures. The PM, through the TO Manager or TCM, shall establish a
   procedure for reviewing and suspensing CFEN inputs. The procedure must stipulate who
   reviews CFENs for each type of document recommended and who has ultimate approval
   authority for acceptance and numbering of the recommended documents.
   6.1.4. CFEN Approval. Upon approval of a CFEN, the TO Manager forwards a letter
   through the appropriate contracting office notifying the contractor of the TO number
   assigned, title (if other than proposed), license rights and copyright release statements,
   quantities required, and shipping instructions (if not covered in the contract TMCR).
   6.1.5. CFEN Disapproval. If the CFEN is disapproved, full justification must be
   provided. If the item has been classified as a nonrepairable or throwaway item, the
   appropriate PM must be notified to ensure the equipment is covered in the Supportability
   Analysis database. If disapproval is due to errors in CFEN preparation rather than
   unnecessary or unsuitable data, the TO Manager should immediately inform the contractor to
   allow timely revision and resubmittal of a corrected CFEN to avoid costly delay.
6.2. MILSPEC TOs. As system or commodity development proceeds, the prime contractor or
subcontractors may identify additional hardware support requirements or components of the end
item that require separate TOs for operation and maintenance of the commodity. For new SE,
the contractor will submit a Support Equipment Recommendation Document (SERD),
accompanied by any required CFENs. For new manuals to support end item components, only
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                  109


the CFEN is required. CFENs may not be required if all TO requirements can be completely
defined in advance in the contract (usually on less complex projects).
   6.2.1. SERD Review. Each SERD submitted must be reviewed and approved as directed
   by the PM before the equipment can be used with the end item. Disapproval of the SERD
   usually disapproves any associated CFENs.
   6.2.2. CFEN Review. For approved SERDs and end item components, associated CFENs
   must be reviewed for applicability, need for a stand-alone manual, depth of coverage
   recommended, etc., and approved separately (TO 00-5-3).
6.3. Contractor Data. In lieu of developing MILSPEC TOs, the contractor may
recommend use of in-house contractor-format technical data. The CFENs and the data
recommended must be reviewed and approved like commercial manuals (paragraph 6.4).
6.4. Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Manuals. When the contractor recommends use of
commercially available SE or end item components, use of manufacturer manuals customarily
provided with the commercial article may also be recommended. Copies of the COTS manuals
are attached to the CFEN recommendations for government review and approval according to
MIL-HDBK-1221. CFENs on COTS manuals must include the contractor evaluation of
suitability according to MIL-HDBK-1221. See TO 00-5-3 for government data rights
requirements.
   6.4.1. COTS Review Copies. Two copies of the COTS manual and CFEN are normally
   forwarded by cover letter to the TO Manager for review and evaluation. One copy should be
   retained in the PM TO library in the event of loss in shipment.
   6.4.2. Reviewers and Suspenses. Reviewing activities usually include the equipment
   specialist managing the commodity and the commodity user. A suspense date should be
   established and follow-up action taken until approval or disapproval is obtained.
   6.4.3. CFEN Status. Depending on the number of contractors and volume of COTS data, a
   database for each contractor should be maintained with summary pages showing status of
   each notice, as well as individual work sheets on each notice providing more detailed
   information on actions taken.
   6.4.4. Developing Supplemental Data. When supplemental data is required to make the
   manual acceptable, the contractor should be contacted to determine if the additional data can
   be obtained from the vendor or if the contractor will have to develop such data. Depending
   on the reply, the additional data may be obtained and the manual returned to the prime ALC
   for reevaluation. If the required data cannot be obtained from the vendor, a cost estimate for
   development of the supplemental data should be requested from the prime contractor. Action
   must be taken to obtain the additional funding required for the supplement, or to reevaluate
   the support concept for the commodity. After the supplemental data is received, the data
   and the original manual should be submitted for reevaluation.
   6.4.5. COTS Manual Records. Each program must establish a list to track proposed COTS
   manuals. The list should include CFAE/CFE Notice numbers, date approved or disapproved
   (with disapproval reasons), contractor, prime ALC, ship dates for the approved manuals, and
   whether or not the manuals were received at the appropriate destination. A follow-up letter
110                                                 AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


   should be sent to the ALC responsible for the commodity and the supporting manual to
   ensure receipt and authorize contractor payment.
   6.4.6. Pre-Screening COTS Manuals. Contractors must review the ―TO-Equipment
   Cross-Reference‖ function of TO 0-1-CD-1, USAF Technical Order Catalog, to prevent
   resubmission of previously approved COTS manuals.
   6.4.7. Responsibility Transfer. TO management responsibility for COTS manuals
   automatically transfers to the equipment SPO TO Manager after signature of the DD Form
   250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report.

Terms
Air Logistic Center (ALC)—The AFMC component having responsibility for the sustainment
phase of a system or commodity life cycle, including the related TOs. ALCs perform depot-
level maintenance on assigned systems and commodities during sustainment. (Some
Product Centers have assumed cradle-to-grave life-cycle management of specific weapon
systems.)
Abeyance-1.—Suspension of compliance with TCTOs and ITCTOs when safety hazards or
possible equipment-damaging processes are discovered with the TCTO procedures. 2. Deferring
action on AFTO IMTs 22 or other TO change requests when they must be held for evaluation
by a regularly constituted work group or committee.
Anticipated Work Stoppage—(See Work Stoppage) Spare assets are available and the
discrepancy or deficiency WILL NOT halt production or delay the schedule or delivery of
the end item. Anticipated work stoppage situations will become work stoppage when not
resolved in time to prevent schedule delays.
Automated Technical Order Management System (ATOMS)—ATOMS is a computer
application designed to assist TODOs with account management, TO ordering and
record-keeping functions associated with TO distribution. ATOMS software with the User
Guide included     is    available through      the TO System       Information Page
(http://www.ide.wpafb.af.mil/toprac/to-syste.htm).
Baseline—A configuration identification document or set of documents formally designated and
fixed at a specific time during a configuration item life cycle. Baselines, plus approved changes
from baselines, constitute the current configuration identification.
Blanket Authority—Extended use of an AFMC IMT 202 to authorize use of substitute parts,
support equipment or procedures on all jobs worked during a specified period of time, not to
exceed 120 days per approved AFMC IMT.

TOs and TCTOs are accurate, adequate, safe, and usable to support the using command
operational and maintenance concepts. To establish validity of TCTO instructions and integrity
of any associated kits by installation of the first production kit on an operational CI using the
preliminary TCTO instructions. Verification is required by the Department of Defense.
Work Stoppage—Work stoppage refers to the inability to proceed with production on a
repair or modification of an end item or commodity, or where a given process stops due to
nonconforming material, inadequate technical data, or lack of proper parts, materials,
components, tooling or facilities. Halted production of a component or part that prevents the
repair or continued scheduled production flow of an end item constitutes a work stoppage.

                                 DEVELOPING TO TITLES

A3.1. General. A TO title relates to the subject and content so users can recognize the
applicability of the TO and tell the difference between TOs with similar applications. The TO
title is used to determine the TO number Category and assign the last segment of the TO
number. TCTO Series Headers use abbreviated titles containing only the Mission/Design/Series
(MDS – e.g., ―MODEL B-52 SERIES H‖) or Type/ Model/ Series (TMS – e.g., ―TYPE
AN/ARN131‖) of the systems or equipment covered. The TO Manager will enter the specific
titles of individual TCTOs when requesting TCTO number assignment. When a commercial
manual does not include a complete title, prepare an Identifying Technical Publication Sheet
(ITPS) according to MIL-HDBK-1221, Evaluation of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS)
Manuals, identifying the complete, accurate TO title and any supplemental data provided.
A3.2. Rules:
   A3.2.1. Do not enter "TECHNICAL MANUAL" as part of the TO title (included
   automatically byMIL-STD-38784).
   A3.2.2. Do not enter the word "PRELIMINARY," for the same reason. Preliminary status is
   shown by setting JCALS ―flags‖ during indexing.
   A3.2.3. Identify supplemental manuals in the first line of the title. Separate from the rest of
   the title by a space, two dashes, and a space. Example: SUPPLEMENTAL MANUAL.
   A3.2.4. In the next part of the TO title, list the type of TO [e.g., maintenance instructions,
   flight manual, illustrated parts breakdown (IPB), etc.] to tell what kind of technical data is
   included in the TO and determine the ―Group (segment) Three‖ (TO type) portion of the TO
   number. Separate the type of TO or medium from the rest of the TO title by using a space,
   two dashes, then a space. Exception: MIL-PRF-83495 TOs will be listed as shown in
   paragraph A2.8, below.
       A3.2.4.1. Use only the types of TOs or media listed in TO 00-5-18.
       A3.2.4.2. Abbreviations may be used (OPR = Operation; INSTR = Instructions; MAINT
       = Maintenance; INTMD = Intermediate; INSP = Inspection; etc.), but must be easily
       translatable.
       A3.2.4.3. Include "INSTR" in the title of any instructional TOs. Examples:
          - FLIGHT MANUAL
          - OPR INSTR
          - MAINT INSTR
          - JOB GUIDE
          - CHECKLIST
          - INTMD INSTR
          - INSP REQUIREMENTS
       A3.2.4.4. If the TO consists of a combination of types, the types are listed in the order
       listed in TO 00-5-18 (e.g., operating instructions (-1) first, maintenance instructions
       (-2) next and parts list (PL) or IPB (-4) following).
AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005                                                                    131


     Examples:
         - OPR AND SVC INSTR
         - MAINT INSTR WITH IPB
         - OVHL INSTR WITH IPB
         - OPN AND SVC INSTR WITH PL
  A3.2.5. The next part of the title identifies the intended level of maintenance if the TO is
  restricted for use at a specified level. (Note that ―INTMD INSTR‖ as used in 2.d.(3) above is
  not restricted to use at the intermediate level.) Separate the intended level of maintenance
  from the rest of the title by using a comma and one space. Examples:
     - MAINT INSTR – DEPOT
     - ASSEMBLY, CHECKOUT, AND MAINT INSTR -- ORG AND INTMD
     - CHECKLIST -- MAINT INSTR, ORG (FLT LINE)
     - MAINT INSTR WITH IPB – INTMD
  A3.2.6. For MIL-PRF-83495 organizational maintenance manuals, the type of TO or
  medium and the intended level of maintenance may be combined, followed by the function.
  Separate the type of TO and the level of maintenance from the function with a space, two
  dashes, and a space. Separate the function from the main part of the TO title by using a
  comma and a space. Examples:
     - ORG MAINT -- JOB GUIDE
     - ORG MAINT -- FAULT REPORTING
     - ORG MAINT -- GENERAL SYSTEM
  A3.2.7. Enter the subject or the equipment identification in the main part of the title. List the
  subject of the TO, or name of the equipment and the type, series, model and part number, in
  that order, when these elements apply. The NSN may be shown if required. Enter the
  manufacturer name in parentheses following the equipment number. Do not split a type,
  series, model or part number between two lines. The words type, series, model or part
  number are not considered part of the number. Examples:
     - IPB -- HOT AIR SHUTOFF VALVE, MODEL CV-2S3.5, PN 105150-2 (STRATOS)
     - OVHL INSTR WITH IPB -- POWER SUPPLY, TYPE ECU-45/A, PN 28VS1006
     (WAGNER)
  A3.2.8. List the TO title classification in parentheses following the main part of the title for
  classified TOs. Examples:

     - MAINT INSTR -- INTMD, COUNTER-MEASURES RECEIVER,
     - TYPE R-1854/ALR-46(V), PN 31-032491-02 (ITEK) (TITLE UNCL)
     NOTE: The classification of the TO and title is entered into JCALS during the indexing
     process, and will appear as a ―U,‖ ―C‖ or ―S‖ in the TO detail screen of the TO catalog.
     The Department of Energy classifications for nuclear weapons technical data classified
     as ―Restricted Data‖ and ―Formerly Restricted Data‖ are not currently supported in
     JCALS, and must be made part of the TO title when applicable.
  A3.2.9. When a proposed TO meets the criteria for a sectionalized manual (that is, it is
  sufficiently large and has natural divisions in tasks or equipment breakout which make
132                                                     AFMCMAN21-1 15 JANUARY 2005


   several smaller manuals more usable and more manageable), each section must be numbered
   and indexed individually. A separate JCALS ―Manage TM Numbering; Assign a Publication
   Number‖ request must be submitted for each section. Each submittal lists the individual title
   and the relationship of each section to the group is set using the ―Manage TM Index; Update
   an Index Entry‖ process, ―Options; Update Index Data; Publication Association‖ function.
   The following examples show TO titles for a group of four sections, all having the same
   basic TO number. Examples:
   - IPB -- RECEIVER GP, TYPE OA-2504/ALD-5 (RAYTHEON)
   - IPB -- SIGNAL ANALYSIS, PROGRAMMER GP, TYPE OA-2505/ALD-5
   (RAYTHEON)
   - IPB -- INDICATOR RECORDER GP, TYPE OA-2506/ALD-5 (RAYTHEON)
   - IPB -- ANTENNA GP, TYPE OA-2507/ALD-5 (SYLVANIA)
   A3.2.10. Various terms are used to describe the test procedures or operator manuals and the
   reference manuals which describe software-related instructions for embedded computers.
   These ―dash eight‖ (-8) manuals contain documentation on how to use software programs
   identified in the CPIN System to check out, test or maintain computer hardware. The
   initiator ensures the title always identifies the specific function of the software
   documentation. Examples:
       - CHECKOUT TAPE MANUAL -- INDICATOR PANEL, TYPE RU-118,
       RADAR BOMB DIRECTING CENTRAL TYPE AN/TSQ-96 (REEVES)
       - TEST PROCEDURES MANUAL -- CONTROL INTERCOMMUNICATIONS SET,
       C-9655/A, PN 3397101-102 (HUGHES)
   A3.2.11. List any special notations in parentheses, such as (FORMERLY TO 12R2-4-
   171-2), or (THIS MANUAL INCOMPLETE WITHOUT TO 31M-2TMQ15-2), or (SA-
   ALC USE ONLY), or (USED WITH TO 36A11-21-2). Only notations of a permanent
   nature about the TO itself are listed here. See ―4‖ below for other catalog notes. Identify
   commercial manuals with an entry in parentheses at the end of the title. Example:
       - OPR INSTR -- DODGE TRUCKS, MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY (COMMERCIAL
       MANUAL)
   A3.2.12. Identify contractor data, as follows. Example:
       - CONTRACTOR ACCEPTANCE REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT AR30873-702
A3.3. System Application. System application data is required both as part of the TO title and
in the TO record in the JCALS Pub Index. The data are used to provide Lists of Applicable
Publications (LOAPs) and to update USAF TO Catalog TO number to Equipment number
cross-reference data . The LOAPs provide an aid for selection of or familiarization with TOs for
a specific system and determination of TO file requirements. The Catalog cross-reference
provides the capability to determine TO coverage for a specific piece of equipment, and helps
to prevent acquiring duplicate tech data between services. The capability to withdraw data by
system application requires consistent adherence to the rules below.
   A3.3.1. Using the ―Manage TM Numbering; Assign a Publication Number‖ process, enter
   only applications to prime aircraft, missiles, space launch vehicles, C-E systems, and engines

       application title entry between title lines such as ―KC‖ one line and ―135‖ on the next
       line.
       A3.3.4.2. The applicable aircraft or missile series designation must be included
       (DOD 4120.15-L). When entering applications of several series in the same system,
       include the complete listing for each series. Use a comma between applications in the
       same series. Example: Use ―F-111A, F-111B, F-111D,‖ not ―F-111A, B, D.‖ For a
       TO applicable to B52G and H enter ―B-52G, B-52H.‖
