SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
This revision was reaccomplished, and changed content and/or numbers. Paragraphs and/or items that
were added/or deleted: TO 00-20-5, Aerospace Vehicle/Equipment Inspection and Documentation, Para,

1. Definition. A dropped object is any aircraft component, cowling, door, panel, part, surface or other
aircraft part lost or inadvertently released during aircrew operations from the beginning of engine start
through flight to engine shutdown at recovery.

2. Responsibilities. The Quality Assurance Office (MXQ) is the Dropped Object Program manager and
the investigating office for the Dropped Object Program. MXQ will immediately investigate reports of
aircraft parts or objects that have dropped from an aircraft in an effort to identify the cause. Ensure a
Material Deficiency Report (PQDR) is submitted (if applicable). Dropped Object incidents will be loaded
in the MXQ Tracking and Trend Analysis (QANTAAS) database and included in the MXQ monthly and
quarterly summaries.
   2.1. Ensure if an object has fallen at home station, the Base Airfield Manager is notified immediately.

    and MXQ.
    2.3. It is the responsibility of all personnel to report objects that have fallen from an aircraft. If Main-
    tenance finds missing items, MXQ, MXG/CC, Flight Safety, OG, OGV and the DOs have to be con-
    tacted immediately for debriefing purposes.
