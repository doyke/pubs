Section 4A—Disease Management Program

4.1. Provision of Care:
   4.1.1. DM focuses on optimizing outcomes in the treatment of sub-populations of patients
   with prevalent and/or chronic diseases or conditions, or those with co-morbidities. The goals
   are to minimize the impact of the disease or chronic condition, and improve the patient’s
   quality of life and self-care.
   4.1.2. DM services will be provided IAW DoD, AFI 44-171, and local PHF directives.
   Program execution will be IAW the steps of DM as described in DOD TMA Medical
   Management Guide 2009, and other current DoD and national DM standards.
   4.1.3. Six basic components of DM:
       4.1.3.1. Population identification.
          4.1.3.1.1. Factors used to identify populations include, but are not limited to: age,
          gender, beneficiary category, risk factors and disease burden, high utilizers, inpatient
          admissions and ED visits.
          4.1.3.1.2. Databases used for population identification include Defense Eligibility
          Enrollment Reporting System (DEERS), MHS Management Analysis and Reporting
          Tool (M2), MHS Population Health Portal (MHSPHP) and AHLTA.
       4.1.3.2. Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs). CPGs form the foundation
       of DM practice. The Population Health Forum recommends CPGs to the Executive
       Committee of the Medical Staff (ECOMS), the approval body, based on the needs of the
       MTF.      MTFs are to utilize approved Veterans Affairs (VA)/DoD CPGs
       (http://www.healthquality.va.gov/) and nationally recognized specialty standards.
       4.1.3.3. Collaborative practice models that include providers and interdisciplinary team
       members. Interdisciplinary, MTF-designated, and CCT meetings ensure effective DM
       and care coordination are accomplished.
       4.1.3.4. Patient self-management education.
          4.1.3.4.1. Components of direct patient care used to execute DM programs include
          counseling, education and training. These could be in the form of one-on-one patient
          encounters, shared encounters, group appointments, classroom education, or
          telephonic encounters.
          4.1.3.4.2. Proactive management of ―first call‖ questions, symptom and problem-
          based issues for patients, such as requests for medication refills, self care advice,
          referrals, and acute needs relevant to CPGs and DM protocols.
       4.1.3.5. Process and outcome measurement, evaluation, and management.
          4.1.3.5.1. Tracking, maintenance, and reporting of metrics as required by DoD, AF
          and local directives.
AFI44-175 10 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    13


       4.1.3.6. Feedback and reporting to stakeholders, including patients, the healthcare team,
       and command leadership.
          4.1.3.6.1. Orientation, education and training of clinical and non-clinical staff on DM
          activities.
       4.1.3.7. Documentation and coding of DM visits will be in BGAZ. Coding of these
       visits will include use of HCPCS codes:
          4.1.3.7.1. S0315: Initiation of Disease Management
          4.1.3.7.2. S0316: Follow up Visit
          4.1.3.7.3. S0320: DM Nurse Call to Patient for Once Monthly Monitoring

Section 4B—Utilization Management Program

4.2. Provision of Care:
   4.2.1. UM is an interdisciplinary process involving the evaluation of quality, risk and cost
   concerns of healthcare services. Referral Management, a subcomponent of UM, includes the
   process of managing and tracking internal/external and network/non-network referrals, active
   duty referrals, and evaluating medical necessity.
   4.2.2. The provision of UM services will be IAW the Seven-Step Quality Improvement
   Process as described in the DOD TMA Medical Management Guide 2009, and will follow
   current DoD and national standards to include Utilization Review Accreditation Commission
   (URAC).
   4.2.3. UM evidence-based criteria and guidelines are described in the clinical decision tools
   of McKesson InterQual hospitalization clinical indicators at http://www.mckesson.com and
   Milliman Care Guidelines for the ambulatory setting at http://www.careguidelines.com.
   These products are available pursuant to a central DoD licensing agreement from TMA
   Population    Health    and     Medical      Management        Division    (PHMMD)         at
   http://www.tricare.mil/ocmo.

Section 4C—Clinical Case Management Program

4.3. Provision of Care.
   4.3.1. CCM is collaborative process of assessment, planning, facilitation, care coordination,
   evaluation, and advocacy for options and services to meet an individual’s and family’s
   comprehensive health needs through communication and available resources to promote
   quality cost- effective outcomes.
   4.3.2. CCM activities are conducted in person at a MTF or other servicing facility as needed
   and telephonically if in-person interaction is not possible. Care coordination activities are
   considered a part of CCM.
   4.3.3. The provision of CM services will be IAW the steps of CM as described in DOD
   TMA Medical Management Guide 2009, the most current DoD and AF standards, and Case
   Management Society of America (CMSA) guidelines and standards.
 14                                                              AFI44-175 10 NOVEMBER 2011


   4.3.4. Housing Inspections: For DoD-provided housing, concerns should be directed to the
   installation’s Civil Engineering Squadron (or equivalent). For temporary housing, concerns
   should be referred to the Force Support Squadron. For non-DoD provided housing, the
   member or member’s family should be directed to obtain advice and counsel through the
   member’s chain of command.
4.4. Steps of Case Management:
   4.4.1. Patient Identification: CM services will be available to all eligible beneficiaries. This
   includes Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard active duty, Reserve and National
   Guard personnel. Questions regarding patient eligibility for care will be directed to the
   Health Benefits office and SGH.
      4.4.1.1. Sources to identify patients for CM services may include, but are not limited to:
      self referrals from patient, family member or caregiver; in-house referrals by clinic staff,
      specialty clinics, Disease Manager or Utilization Manager; local and non-local network
      and non-network providers and agencies; Military Medical Support Office, Recovery
      Care Coordinators (RCCs), Federal Recovery Care Coordinators (FRCCs), Managed
      Care Support Contractors (MCSCs), other DoD and VA facilities; high utilizer lists;
      Medical Evaluation Boards (MEBs); Exceptional Family Member Program-Medical
      (EFMP-M) program; post deployment screenings; admissions, dispositions and inpatient
      census reports.

              treatment and rehabilitation.
          4.4.1.2.2. CAT 2.
              4.4.1.2.2.1. Has a serious injury or illness.
              4.4.1.2.2.2. Is unlikely to return to duty in less than 180 days.
              4.4.1.2.2.3. May be medically separated from the military.
          4.4.1.2.3. CAT 3.
              4.4.1.2.3.1. Has a severe/catastrophic injury or illness.
              4.4.1.2.3.2. Is highly unlikely to return to duty.

             4.4.1.2.4.15. Poly-substance abuse.
  4.4.2. Assessment. Screening of patients will enable the Clinical Case Manager to determine
  the patient’s need for CM. If the patient does not meet criteria, the patient should be referred
  back to the originator of the referral with suggested alternatives. Documentation of screening
  for CM services and disposition of the patient will be made in the patient’s medical record.
     4.4.2.1. During assessments, AHLTA templates must be used to determine if a patient
     meets criteria for full, on-going case management services (IAW URAC Case
     Management, current version).
         4.4.2.1.1. Initial Assessment. Use the most current AF approved Case Management
         AHLTA AIM form.
             4.4.2.1.1.1. The initial assessment template must be completed prior to initiating
             a patient care plan. It includes the minimum standards of current health status and
             past medical history, treatment plan, resources required to meet needs for
             healthcare, psychosocial status, and safety concerns. All applicable blocks should
             be completed.
         4.4.2.1.2. Care Plans and Continuation Visits. Use the most current AF approved
         Case Management AHLTA AIM form.
             4.4.2.1.2.1. Patients with a CM start or continue will be contacted a minimum of
             one time every calendar month.
         4.4.2.1.3. Either template may also be used for subsequent patient encounters and
         care coordination encounters as desired. Only sections applicable to the encounter
         have to be completed.
     4.4.2.2. A full CM intake will be initiated or scheduled with the identified patient within
     one business day of referral/patient identification. The complete assessment (AHLTA
     form) shall be accomplished within three business days. An explanation will be entered
     into the patient’s record if this standard was not met.
16                                                         AFI44-175 10 NOVEMBER 2011


     4.4.2.3. Prior to acting on the patient’s behalf, CM will obtain written consent from the
     patient or the legal guardian. This consent allows the Clinical Case Manager to discuss
     and arrange aspects of the treatment plan with all other parties. (A sample authorization
     form is provided on CD-ROM Resource CM-8, DOD TMA Medical Management Guide
     2009.) This form must be filed in the patient’s medical record.
  4.4.3. Planning is done in collaboration with the patient and family/care giver to determine
  specific goals, objectives, and actions to meet the needs of the patient. The PCM and CCT
  members may also be included in the planning.
     4.4.3.1. An Initial Care Plan should be completed within 5 business days of the
     completed assessment. A Comprehensive Care Plan is to be completed within 30 days of
     the initial assessment.
     4.4.3.2. Care Plans should contain action oriented short and long term goals with
     designated time frames; identification of immediate patient support systems and actual
     and potential resources.
     4.4.3.3. The Comprehensive Care Plan should include action oriented goals with
     designated time frames specific to the patient’s needs; identify immediate patient support
     systems; advocate for the patient and family as needed; and identify actual and potential
     resources.
  4.4.4. Implementation. Involves the execution of the required interventions identified in the
  plan of care that will lead to accomplishing the stated goals. Clear communication with the
  patient and family/care giver as well as the healthcare team is crucial. Care plans should be
  reviewed and updated at least monthly.
  4.4.5. Coordination. Includes organizing, securing, integrating and modifying resources
  necessary to accomplish the goals of the care plan. All available resources should be
  considered and utilized to ensure access to care is appropriate, timely, optimal and cost-
  effective.
     4.4.5.1. Families within the EFMP will have proactive coordination to ensure services
     are available and in place when an EFMP family arrives at a new duty station.
     4.4.5.2. Primary case management of WIIDR patients is typically accomplished by the
     closest geographically located DoD facility Clinical Case Manager. The AF does not
     utilize WIT clinics. The majority of WIIDR Airmen remain assigned to their home
     station, and small numbers are assigned to, or are in temporary TDY status, in a patient
     squadron. It is therefore imperative the local Clinical Case Manager communicates with
     the member’s home station Clinical Case Manager to ensure there is timely status
     information, continued tracking and appropriate follow-up of those patients through the
     system.
     4.4.5.3. Transfer of information will be coordinated with the MCSC case managers when
     patients require care outside of the Direct Care System.
     4.4.5.4. A warm hand off to another Clinical Case Manager, health care provider, and/or
     the RCC will occur when there is a transfer of care to another facility, agency, or the VA
     for additional treatment and follow-up.
AFI44-175 10 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                     17


         4.4.5.4.1. The report will be documented in the patient’s medical record and include
         a verbal and written plan encompassing the elements crucial to the smooth transition
         of the patient to a new site of care, i.e., medical/nursing care requirements, social and
         physical needs, services required, follow-up, and durable medical equipment.
         4.4.5.4.2. The CM Care Plan and any official paperwork pertinent to the patient’s
         medical condition and personnel status will be provided electronically or by hard
         copy with the patient.
     4.4.5.5. Documentation of the transfer and handoff should include the diagnosis or
     medical condition that prompted the need for CM services and a summary of the patient’s
     current medical status; date of transfer; reason for transfer; mode of transfer; accepting
     Clinical Case Manager and physician.
     4.4.5.6. Support to the Recovery Care Coordination Program should be provided by
     reporting identified patients who meet CAT 2 and 3 criteria to the RCC, including the
     RCC in CCT meetings as appropriate, and identifying and timely communicating issues
     to the RCC.
  4.4.6. Monitoring. The ongoing process of gathering information from relevant sources
  regarding activities and services provided to determine the effectiveness of the planned
  outcomes. This process includes timely and appropriate care based on the patient’s changing
  status, patient/family/provider timely contact and follow-up, identification of variances from
  the plan of care and revisions accordingly, utilization of resources, results of interventions
  and care delivery.
  4.4.7. Evaluation. Measures both the patient’s outcomes to the healthcare services and the
  program’s effectiveness for delivery of care. Patient outcomes use clinical, functional,
  and/or satisfaction indicators. Some examples are: reduced length of stay, cost reduction in
  use of medications, or patient satisfaction with increased access to a specific care need.
  Program outcomes are based on program goals, processes, and the MTF’s strategic plan.
  Some examples are: difference in number of ED visits before and after case management was
  initiated, fiscal impact on an aspect of care, workload such as number of case management
  cases closed per month, interoperability with all Service personnel systems (i.e., RCCs,
  FRCCs, other Service personnel, VA, MCSC). A more thorough discussion of case
  management sample measures and outcomes can be found in the DOD TMA Medical
  Management Guide 2009.
     4.4.7.1. Each MTF will identify relevant patient and program outcomes with results
     reported quarterly to the PHF.
  4.4.8. Documentation and Coding.
     4.4.8.1. Registered Nurses and Licensed Clinical Social Workers performing outpatient
     primary clinical case management are required to document all case management
     activities, to include care coordination, and code in the patient’s electronic medical record
     (AHLTA), using DoD-established provider specialty codes, Health Insurance Portability
     and Accountability Act (HIPAA) taxonomy codes, MEPRS codes, diagnosis codes, and
     Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes IAW DoD UBU,
     Appendix E, Coding Case Management Services. This requirement does not apply to
     nurses performing occasional case management as part of their regular assigned
18                                                        AFI44-175 10 NOVEMBER 2011


     duties, i.e., specialty clinic nurses, Family Health Team nurses or Disease Managers.
     These nurses are to document and code within their assigned MEPRS clinics.
     4.4.8.2. Telephonic encounters can involve complex case management or simple care
     coordination. These will be documented and coded IAW established nursing telephonic
     coding guidelines.
     4.4.8.3. An encounter will be generated with each patient contact and preferably closed
     out by the end of the day. Encounters will be closed out within the mandatory 72 hours.
     4.4.8.4. All CM encounters will be placed in the ELAN MEPRS for CM workload
     accountability.
     4.4.8.5. Accurate use of V49 codes, T1016 Procedure Code combined with units of
     service, and the appropriate G acuity code, designating the case management status of a
     patient, is critical for reliable metrics reporting. A case must be annotated as start,
     continue, ongoing, or end IAW Appendix E, current Ed.
        4.4.8.5.1. New Case: when a patient is identified as requiring case management
        services by the MTF Clinical Case Manager. The encounter will be coded with the
        V49.89_2 Start, E&M 99499, T1016 Procedure Code combined with units of service,
        and the appropriate G acuity code.
        4.4.8.5.2. Ongoing Case: when a patient that has been placed in case management
        and needs continued follow-up care. An entry will be placed into AHLTA on the care
        given. The encounter will be coded with the V49.89_3 Continue, E&M 99499,
        T1016 Procedure Code combined with units of service, and the appropriate G acuity
        code.
        4.4.8.5.3. Closed Case: when a patient no longer requires case management services
        by the MTF Clinical Case Manager, an entry will be made in AHLTA explaining the
        reason for the case closure. In addition, the care plan will be updated indicating the
        reason for case closure and the date. The encounter will be coded with the V49.89_4
        End, E&M 99499, T1016 Procedure Code combined with units of service, and the
        appropriate G acuity code.
        4.4.8.5.4. Care Coordination: when a patient encounter not in need of extensive case
        management and does not have an open care plan, an entry will be placed into
        AHLTA on the care given. The encounter will be coded with V49.89_9 Other and
        Unspecified, E&M 99499, T1016 Procedure Code combined with units of service,
        and the appropriate G acuity code.
        4.4.8.5.5. T1016 Procedure Code combined with units of service will be used by all
        Case Managers (Nurses and Social Workers) to document time spent on case
        management activities for the reported encounter in 15 minute intervals.
        4.4.8.5.6. A monthly patient acuity will be documented using the appropriate G
        acuity code (G9002, G9005, G9009, G9010 and G9011). This may be done with
        every encounter computing the acuity based on all encounters for the last 30 days.
     4.4.8.6. Clinical Case Managers will accurately account for monthly workload in
     appropriate MEPRS and/or Defense Medical Human Resources System (DMHRSi).

Section 4D—Discharge Planning

4.5. Provision of Care.
   4.5.1. DP typically begins at the time of a patient’s admission, and involves updating the
   plan of care as necessary until discharge, ensuring the patient will have the necessary,
   medical equipment or devices, follow-up and care management after discharge. DP may be
   accomplished by a designated Discharge Planner, a Clinical Case Manager, other nurse or
   licensed clinical social worker.
   4.5.2. DP services will follow guidelines IAW DOD TMA Medical Management Guide
   2009, the general CCM guidelines previously noted, and DoD, AF and CMSA standards.
