                                     FOREWORD
        In war, defeating an enemy’s force is often a necessary step on the path to
victory. Defeating enemy armies is a difficult task that often comes with a high price tag
in terms of blood and treasure. With its inherent speed, range, and flexibility, air and
space power offers a way to lower that risk by providing commanders a synergistic tool
that can provide a degree of control over the surface environment and render enemy
forces ineffective before they meet friendly land forces. Modern air and space power
directly affects an adversary's ability to initiate, conduct, and sustain ground combat.

       Counterland operations dominate the surface environment by crushing an
enemy’s ability to fight on land. Through air interdiction, air and space power can divert,
disrupt, delay, or destroy enemy military potential before it can be brought to bear
against friendly ground forces, and achieve joint force commander objectives
independently. Indeed, the devastation wrought on an enemy by air and space power
may preclude costly ground combat. When called for, air and space power delivers
devastating support to assist friendly ground forces in achieving their objectives.

        Twenty-first century capabilities regarding precision, information technology,
space, intelligence, and command and control increase counterland effectiveness.
Modern counterland capabilities can help achieve objectives more efficiently than in the
past. This provides commanders a flexible capability that makes other applications of
military power more effective and may drive an early end to conflict.

       When the objective is to destroy an enemy army’s capability to fight, air and
space power should always be considered as a first option. Air and space power has
inherent, unique advantages in conducting counterland operations, but commanders
should recognize they are more effective in conjunction with other forms of military
action. In fact, other air and space power functions often complement counterland
operations to produce operational level effects to destroy an enemy’s warfighting
capability.

        Air Force Doctrine Document 2-1.3, Counterland Operations, is doctrine for
understanding, planning, and executing this crucial air and space power function across
the full range of military operations. Air Force personnel need to be able to articulate
the rationale for counterland as a valuable warfighting option for the combatant
commander. More importantly, Air Force personnel must understand how counterland
operations can help enhance military strategies as a tool for defeating our nation’s
adversaries.

                                   INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE

       This Air Force doctrine document (AFDD) establishes doctrinal guidance for the
United States Air Force on counterland. It articulates fundamental Air Force principles
for the application of combat force and provides commanders operational guidance on
the employment and integration of Air Force resources to achieve desired objectives.

APPLICATION

        This AFDD applies to the Total Force: all Air Force military and civilian personnel,
including regular, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard units and members.
Unless specifically stated otherwise, Air Force doctrine applies to the full range of
military operations.

      The doctrine in this document is authoritative, but not directive. Therefore,
commanders need to consider the contents of this AFDD and the particular situation
when accomplishing their missions. Airmen should read it, discuss it, and practice it.


SCOPE

       This doctrine provides guidance for planning and conducting counterland
operations in support of US national security and combatant/joint force commander
objectives.




                                             vi
                   COMAFFOR / JFACC / CFACC
                     A note on terminology
       One of the cornerstones of Air Force doctrine is that “the US Air Force
prefers - and in fact, plans and trains - to employ through a commander, Air
Force forces (COMAFFOR) who is also dual-hatted as a joint force air and
space component commander (JFACC).” (AFDD 1)

       To simplify the use of nomenclature, Air Force doctrine documents will
assume the COMAFFOR is dual-hatted as the JFACC unless specifically stated
otherwise. The term “COMAFFOR” refers to the Air Force Service component
commander while the term “JFACC” refers to the joint component-level
operational commander.

        While both joint and Air Force doctrine state that one individual will
normally be dual-hatted as COMAFFOR and JFACC, the two responsibilities are
different, and should be executed through different staffs.

        Normally,     the    COMAFFOR        function   executes      operational
control/administrative control of assigned and attached Air Force forces through
a Service A-staff while the JFACC function executes tactical control of joint air
and space component forces through an air and space operations center (AOC).

        When multinational operations are involved, the JFACC becomes a
combined force air and space component commander (CFACC). Likewise, the
air and space operations center, though commonly referred to as an AOC, in
joint or combined operations is correctly known as a JAOC or CAOC. Since
nearly every operation the US conducts will involve international partners, this
publication uses the terms CFACC and CAOC throughout to emphasize the
doctrine’s applicability to multi-national operations.

                FOUNDATIONAL DOCTRINE STATEMENTS
      Foundational doctrine statements are the basic principles and beliefs upon which
AFDDs are built. Other information in the AFDDs expands on or supports these
statements.

         Counterland operations are air and space operations against enemy land
         force capabilities to create effects that achieve joint force commander (JFC)
         objectives (Page 1)

         Counterland operations are a form of maneuver warfare that seeks to shatter
         an enemy’s fighting ability through focused attacks against key enemy military
         targets. (Page 2)

         Counterland operations can serve as the main attack and be the decisive
         means for achieving JFC objectives. (Page 3)

         Counterland operations can achieve tactical-, operational-, or strategic-level
         effects, and can significantly influence the course of a military operation.
         (Page 4)

         Counterland operations are supported by two types of air operations for
         engaging enemy land forces: air interdiction (AI) and close air support (CAS).
         (Page 5)

         The Air Force defines AI as air operations conducted to divert, disrupt, delay,
         or destroy the enemy’s military potential before it can be brought to bear
         against friendly forces or to otherwise achieve JFC objectives. These
         operations are conducted at such distance from friendly forces that detailed
         integration with those forces is not required. (Page 5)

         The combined force air and space component commander (CFACC) is
         normally the supported commander for the JFC’s overall AI effort. When
         designated as the supported commander, the CFACC will conduct theater-
         wide or joint operations area-wide AI in direct support of the JFC’s overall
         theater objectives. (Page 6)

         CAS is air action by fixed- and rotary-winged aircraft against hostile targets
         that are in close proximity to friendly forces and which require detailed
         integration of each air mission with the fire and movement of those forces.
         (Page 6)

         AI can channel movements, constrict logistic systems, disrupt
         communications, force urgent movement, and attrit enemy fielded forces.
         (Page 21)




                                          viii
Accurate information about the enemy’s support characteristics, force
structure, and ability to adapt is imperative to successful AI. (Page 30)

The success of both offensive and defensive CAS operations in contiguous,
linear warfare may depend on massing effects at decisive points—not diluting
them across the entire battlefield. (Page 33)

Missions attacking targets not in close proximity to friendly forces, and
beyond the range requiring detailed integration with surface fires and
maneuver, should be conducted using AI procedures vice CAS. (Page 38)

Throughout the entire process, CAS operations remain under the control of
the joint air component while supporting the joint land component. (Page 50)

The theater air control system (TACS) provides the CFACC the capability to
centrally plan and control joint air operations through the combined air
operations center while facilitating decentralized execution through the
subordinate elements of the TACS. (Page 51)

The preponderance of kinetic effects shifts from landpower to airpower near
the maximum range of organic field artillery. Therefore, under all but the most
rapid ground maneuvers, the fire support coordination line (FSCL) is normally
placed near the maximum range of tube artillery because air and space
power provides the most expeditious attack of surface targets beyond that
point. (Page 70)

The FSCL is primarily used to establish command and control procedures for
planning and execution purposes—it does not define mission types. (Page
71)

                                   CHAPTER ONE
                       COUNTERLAND FUNDAMENTALS

         The air force has become the hammer of modern warfare on land…
      aviation gives modern battle a third dimension.

                                  — Lieutenant Colonel Ferdinand Otto Miksche,
                              Infantry Officer & Military Strategist, writing in 1942

         Military history provides many successful examples where airpower smashed
enemy land forces in modern warfare, from the breakout of Normandy in World War II to
the destruction of the Iraqi army in 1991 and 2003. Attacking the capabilities of land
forces through air and space power—counterland operations—is often a necessary step
on the path to military victory. As a vital element in joint warfare, air and space power
continues to demonstrate a unique ability to accurately find, fix, track, target, engage,
and assess (F2T2EA) enemy land forces. Because of these essential counterland
capabilities, it is virtually unthinkable to go into combat without air and space power
today. With a solid comprehension of counterland operations, Airmen increase their
ability to properly plan and execute air warfare against enemy land forces. This chapter
provides a basis for understanding counterland operations by giving a fundamental
explanation of its purpose, functional missions, and capabilities.

DEFINITION AND PURPOSE
       Counterland operations are air and space operations against enemy land
force capabilities to create effects that achieve joint force commander (JFC)
objectives. The aim of counterland operations is to dominate the surface environment
using air and space power. By dominating the surface environment, counterland
operations can assist friendly land maneuver while denying the enemy the ability to
resist. Although most frequently associated with support to friendly surface forces,
counterland operations may also be conducted independent of friendly surface force
objectives or in operations where no friendly land forces are present. For example,
recent conflicts in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq illustrate situations where
counterland operations have been used absent significant friendly land forces or with
small numbers of special operations forces (SOF) providing target cueing. This
independent or direct attack of adversary land operations by air and space forces often
provides the key to success when seizing the initiative, especially in the opening phase
of an operation.
       The JFC has two distinct means for engaging enemy land forces that support
counterland operations. The first is air interdiction (AI), in which airpower supports land
forces in addition to supporting JFC objectives. The second method is close air support
(CAS), in which airpower directly supports land maneuver. Whether destroying enemy
surface forces, interdicting supply routes, or providing CAS to friendly troops,
counterland operations are a vital air and space power function that applies throughout
the range of conflict.


                                            1
        Counterland operations are a form of aerial maneuver that seeks to shatter
an enemy’s fighting ability through focused attacks against key enemy military
targets. Air and space forces, with their inherent speed, range, and precision attack
capabilities, are superior theater-level maneuver forces. Where ground forces must
seek out weak points in the enemy line to penetrate and exploit, aircraft and missiles
can maneuver in three dimensions and directly attack key points in the enemy rear. By
striking enemy military targets such as fielded land forces, command and control (C2)
nodes, vital logistics, or supporting infrastructure, the destruction of decisive points,
forces, and capabilities degrades the enemy system and ultimately renders the enemy
incapable of effective resistance. Persistently applied, airpower can permanently
disrupt the enemy and crush its ability to fight as a coherent, effective whole, thus
wresting initiative and dictating tempo.
        Counterland operations can support and facilitate maneuver warfare on land.
World War I saw the first widespread use of airpower in support of Allied land
operations when combat aircraft began cutting supply routes, strafing trenches,
and      bombing      fielded
forces. Military leaders            Counterland operations achieve JFC objectives.

        Counterland operations can serve as the main attack and be the decisive
means for achieving JFC objectives. Although often associated with support to
friendly surface forces, counterland operations also include operations that directly
support theater strategy rather than exclusively supporting a surface component. In
some cases, counterland operations can provide the sole effort against the enemy.
This occurred in the Balkans during Operation ALLIED FORCE in 1999, when the US-
led coalition contained no

        Air and space power offers a critical capability to deliver lethal and nonlethal
combat power against enemy land forces. Due to its inherent speed, range, flexibility,
lethality, precision, and ability to mass at a desired time and place, air and space power
transcends the normal operating limitations imposed on surface forces. Able to strike
enemy surface forces across the width and depth of the theater, air and space power
contributes significantly to the counterland effort and can reduce or even eliminate the
need to engage in potentially costly ground combat.

       Stealth, precision, persistence, information technology, unmanned aircraft
system (UAS), and modern sensors have revolutionized counterland warfare. The
impressive successes of air and space power during Operations DESERT STORM,
ALLIED FORCE, ENDURING FREEDOM, and IRAQI FREEDOM prove the viability of
recent technological advances in modern warfare. Stealth and night capabilities
increase survivability. Precision weapons enable one sortie to strike several targets
rather than requiring several sorties for the destruction of one target. Information
technology increases flexibility, aids decision making, facilitates integration, increases
tempo, and improves combat assessment during counterland operations. With
inherently long loiter and weapons carrying capacity, unmanned aircraft (UA) such as
the MQ-1 Predator can provide a persistent counterland capability to the battlefield.
Information shared among aircraft, surface forces, command nodes, and space
platforms provides valuable intelligence, continuous surveillance, and precise targeting
of an enemy’s military capabilities. A counterland platform using data link, precision
weapons, optical and infrared sensors, radar, and advanced fire control systems
provides an all-weather night attack capability that often is equal to, or surpasses,
daytime operations in terms of target detection, aircraft survivability, and attack
accuracy.
        Counterland operations are not strictly associated with a particular type of aircraft
or weapon system. Instead, a variety of combat air assets conducts counterland
operations to deliver lethal and less than lethal effects against enemy land forces and
their support structure. Predominant weapons systems used in counterland operations
include aircraft equipped with cannons, bombs, mines, missiles, rockets, and electronic
warfare (EW) systems. Air assets, space platforms, and SOF provide intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) as well as target cueing, navigation aids, and
battle damage assessment (BDA). Each weapon system has unique characteristics
that should be considered based on the nature of the specific threat, targets to be
attacked, and environmental conditions. Many of the assets used to interdict forces
deep in the enemy rear can also be used to support the close fight and vice versa.
Fighters, bombers, gunships, unmanned aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles, and Army
tactical missile systems (ATACMS) are a few examples of joint assets that air
component commanders can use to execute counterland operations.

COUNTERLAND EFFECTS
       Counterland operations can achieve tactical-, operational-, or strategic-
level effects, and can significantly influence the course of a military operation.
Counterland effects focus at the tactical and operational levels of war by targeting


                                             4
fielded enemy surface forces and their supporting infrastructure. When planned and
executed successfully, counterland operational effects will indirectly lead to strategic
effects by denying the enemy’s ability to execute a coherent ground campaign. In
cases where the enemy places strategic value on a specific portion of their ground
combat force, counterland operations can produce more immediate effects at the
strategic level.

        As witnessed during the recent conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq, and Afghanistan,
Counterland operations apply across the range of military operations. Although they are
usually associated with history’s major wars, counterland operations have routinely
taken place in stability operations characterized by insurgency, guerrilla tactics, and civil
strife.1 To be effective, however, counterland operations must adapt to the situation.
Conducting counterland operations against an unconventional enemy with a primitive
force structure differs from attacking a modern, highly mechanized army with heavy
logistics requirements. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the nature of the conflict to
properly apply air and space power during counterland operations.

AIR INTERDICTION AND CLOSE AIR SUPPORT
        Counterland operations are supported by two types of air operations for
engaging enemy land forces: AI and CAS. AI may operate as a supported part of the
overall theater strategy or it may indirectly support the land component. CAS is
normally considered direct support to surface components by the air component. AI
and CAS missions can function under an overall theater posture of offense or defense
and are typically coordinated with a ground scheme of maneuver to maximize the effect
on the enemy. This section gives a brief overview of AI and CAS by discussing their
definitions and purpose to provide a basic understanding of their character. Chapters 2
and 3 expand the discussion and give a more detailed description of each.

Air Interdiction
        The purpose of interdiction is to attack the enemy’s ability to fight by targeting
tactical and operational forces and infrastructure with either lethal or non-lethal means
(See Joint Publication [JP] 3-03, Joint Doctrine for Joint Interdiction). 2 The Air Force
defines AI as air operations conducted to divert, disrupt, delay, or destroy the
enemy’s military potential before it can be brought to bear effectively against
friendly forces, or to otherwise achieve JFC objectives. AI is conducted at such
distance from friendly forces that detailed integration of each air mission with the
fire and movement of friendly forces is not required. AI targets may include fielded

  Historical examples include: British air policing in the Middle East during the interwar period, French
operations during the battle for Algeria, the US in Vietnam, the insurgent war in El Salvador, and recent
US air operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
2
  Not all air interdiction falls under the category of counterland. History has many examples of airpower
interdicting the enemy’s air or sea lines of communication; these are actually counterair or countersea
missions even though they may have an interdiction effect at the operational level. Additionally, some
interdiction missions may be considered a subset of strategic attack as described later in Chapter 1 in the
section titled “Joint Integration and Complimentary Missions.”


                                                    5
enemy forces or supporting components such as operational C2 nodes,
communications networks, transportation systems, supply depots, military resources,
and other vital infrastructure. When conducted as part of a joint campaign, interdiction
needs the direction of a single commander who can exploit and coordinate all the forces
involved, whether air-, space-, surface-, or information-based.

        The combined force air and space component commander (CFACC) is
normally the supported commander for the JFC’s overall AI effort. When
designated as the supported commander, the CFACC will conduct theater-wide or
joint operating area (JOA)-wide AI in direct support of the JFC’s overall theater
objectives. With the preponderance of AI assets and the ability to plan, task, and
control joint air operations, the CFACC can best plan and execute AI. The CFACC
recommends theater and/or JOA-wide targeting priorities and, in coordination with other
component commanders, forwards the air apportionment recommendation to the JFC.
The CFACC, using the priorities or percentages established by the JFC’s air
apportionment decision, then plans and executes the theater and/or JOA-wide
interdiction effort.

Close Air Support
        CAS is air action by fixed- and rotary-winged aircraft against hostile targets
that are in close proximity to friendly forces and which require detailed
integration of each air mission with the fire and movement of those forces (see JP
3-09.3, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Close Air Support). CAS
provides supporting firepower in offensive and defensive operations to destroy, disrupt,
suppress, fix, harass, neutralize, or delay enemy targets as an element of joint fire
support. The speed, range, and maneuverability of airpower allow CAS assets to attack
targets that other supporting arms may not be able to engage effectively. CAS can be
conducted at any place and time friendly forces are in close proximity to enemy forces
and, at times, may be the best means to exploit tactical opportunities. Although in
isolation it rarely achieves campaign-level objectives, at times it may be the more critical
mission due to its contribution to campaign objectives. CAS should be planned to
prepare the conditions for success or reinforce successful attacks of surface forces.
CAS can halt attacks, help create breakthroughs, destroy targets of opportunity, cover
retreats, and guard flanks. To be most effective, however, CAS should be used at
decisive points in a battle and should normally be massed to apply concentrated combat
power and saturate defenses. Equally important is that the appropriate level of C2, with
appropriate release authority at a commensurate level, be in place to facilitate the
expeditious application of airpower in rapidly changing scenarios. In fluid, high-intensity
warfare, the need for terminal control, the unpredictability of the tactical situation, the
risk of fratricide, and the proliferation of lethal ground-based air defenses make CAS
especially challenging.

        CAS requires a significant level of coordination between air and surface forces to
produce desired effects. CAS employment should be safe, accurate, and timely to
create effects that support the ground scheme of maneuver. The fluidity of the ground
situation that exists within this close proximity usually requires real-time direction from a


                                             6
joint terminal attack controller to ensure that targets of highest priority to the ground
commander are struck. Additionally, when friendly forces are within close proximity,
more restrictive control measures may be required to integrate CAS with surface
maneuver and joint fires. Integrating airpower and surface maneuver is an important
factor for mitigating fratricide from both air-delivered weapons and surface fires. Thus,
Airmen should consider two key factors when employing CAS: the need for flexible,
real-time targeting guidance and the avoidance of hitting friendly ground forces in close
proximity to the target.

Types of AI and CAS
        Counterland missions are either scheduled or on-call. Scheduled missions result
from preplanned requests during the normal air tasking order (ATO) cycle and allow for
detailed coordination between the tactical air and ground units involved. Additionally,
preplanned requests may result in counterland sorties in an on-call status (either
airborne or ground alert) to cover periods of expected enemy action, respond to
immediate requests, or attack dynamic targets. Scheduled AI missions use detailed
intelligence to attack known or anticipated targets in an operational area to generate
effects that achieve JFC objectives. Scheduled CAS missions are normally dedicated
to a specific ground unit or operation. Air planners attach a “G” or “X” prefix to the ATO
mission identifier to designate either ground or airborne alert, respectively.

          GAI is a mission placed on ground alert to provide responsive AI throughout
          the theater in response to emerging targets.

          XAI is a mission that pursues a designated area versus a particular target.
          XAI may fly airborne alert or search particular areas to strike at targets of
          opportunity.

          GCAS is a mission placed on ground alert status to provide responsive air
          support to ground forces that encounter substantial enemy resistance. CAS
          assets located close to the supported ground forces normally provide faster
          response times. GCAS missions may be changed to XCAS as the situation
          dictates.

          XCAS is a mission on airborne alert status in the vicinity of ground forces that
          expect to encounter enemy resistance. XCAS sorties typically remain in
          established holding patterns to provide responsive air support while awaiting
          tasking from any ground unit that needs CAS. If no tasking evolves during
          the vulnerability period, XCAS missions may swing to an AI role if other
          appropriate targets exist.

       Some counterland missions may not clearly fall under the traditional definition of
CAS and AI, but are still examples of airpower used against enemy surface forces or
supporting infrastructure--the generic term “attack” may be used in such cases.
Other labels such as strategic attack describe air-to-ground missions that fall under a
different operational function than counterland.


                                            7
        Theater battle management core systems (TBMCS) has a myriad of “mission
 type” descriptors for missions ranging from direct support of surface forces, to the
 independent application of airpower supporting JFC objectives in the absence of
 surface forces. Mission type descriptors and their prefixes should not be confused
 with or tied to supported/supporting relationships. For example, an XAI mission using
 SOF as a sensor could quickly devolve to a CAS mission if the SOF unit were
 compromised. In this case, airpower supported by SOF becomes SOF supported by
 airpower very quickly, and is transparent to the TBMCS mission type planned.

        Scheduled AI missions can be dynamically retasked to provide CAS or attack
time-sensitive targets if requisites such as aircrew qualifications, weapons load, and
weapons fusing are compatible. Commanders and planners should carefully consider
the resultant balance between effectiveness and efficiency caused by keeping a portion
of air assets in reserve when apportioning ground-based and air alert missions.

       Immediate requests usually result from situations that develop after the suspense
for preplanned requests in a particular ATO cycle. Dynamic targeting provides a
responsive use of on-call or dynamically retasked counterland missions to exploit
enemy vulnerability that may be of limited duration. However, dynamic targeting may
lead to an overall reduction in the probability of success because of reduced time for
mission preparation and target study. Chapters 2 and 3 provide an expanded
discussion of scheduled and on-call counterland missions.

Derivative Missions Associated with Counterland
      Derivative mission-types are frequently tasked to complement and support
counterland operations. The following discussion briefly describes the two most
common missions that are associated with, and facilitate the effective accomplishment
of, CAS and AI.

          Forward Air Controller (Airborne) (FAC[A]). FAC(A) missions provide joint
          terminal attack control for CAS aircraft operating in close proximity to friendly
          ground forces. Because of the risk of fratricide, FAC(A)s are specially trained
          aviation officers qualified to provide delivery clearance to CAS aircraft. The
          FAC(A) is the only person cleared to perform such control from the air, and
          can be especially useful in controlling CAS against targets that are beyond
          the visual range of friendly ground forces.

          Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance (SCAR). SCAR missions use
          aircraft to detect targets for dedicated AI missions in a specified geographic
          zone. The area may be defined by a box or grid where worthwhile potential
          targets are known or suspected to exist, or where mobile enemy surface units
          have relocated because of ground fighting.

        SCAR missions are normally part of the C2 interface to coordinate multiple
flights, detect targets, kill targets, neutralize enemy air defenses, and provide BDA.
SCAR aircrew perform a similar function for AI missions that FAC(A) provide for CAS


                                            8
missions. Typical tasks include cycling multiple attacking flights through the target area
and providing prioritized targeting guidance to maximize the effect of each sortie.
Although fighter aircraft often accomplish SCAR missions, other platforms such as the
Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) and MQ-1/MQ-9 Predator
UAS’ can perform SCAR tasks such as locating, verifying, and cross cueing other
assets to positively identify moving targets; procedurally controlling and sequencing
aircraft; and passing target updates. The MQ-1 and MQ-9 can also find, fix, and track
potential targets for subsequent AI missions. These platforms may also be able to
engage targets on their own, buddy lase for manned aircraft, and provide BDA for the
same mission. Optimally, the deconfliction and sequencing of aircraft is best performed
by an E-3 airborne warning and control system (AWACS) or a ground-based control and
reporting center (CRC).

       Even though some SCAR responsibilities are similar to that of a FAC(A), SCAR
aircrew DO NOT have the authority to provide terminal attack control. FAC(A)s undergo
specialized training to effectively coordinate and integrate air-ground forces to conduct
terminal attack control safely during CAS—a SCAR pilot does not have these
specialized qualifications.

      The bottom line: a FAC(A) can conduct SCAR but a SCAR aircrew cannot
conduct FAC(A) duties. Planners and commanders need to understand this important
nuance when tasking XAI missions or diverting airborne aircraft to an immediate CAS
request (in addition to the fact that not all AI aircrews are qualified to conduct CAS).

JOINT CONSIDERATIONS
        When discussing the use of air and space power in counterland operations, it is
necessary to recognize the contribution of other components’ aviation arms. Navy,
Marine Corps, Army, and SOF assets can be used for both AI and CAS. While the
primary task for Marine aviation is support to their own ground forces, excess Marine
sorties may execute other elements of the JFC’s plan. Scout and attack helicopters
may also prove valuable platforms for counterland missions even though they lack the
speed, range, and survivability of fixed-wing assets. Although the Army does not
consider their helicopters CAS platforms, they can nevertheless employ CAS tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTP) when operating in support of land forces. Depending
on circumstances and threat, SOF AC-130s may be available to support certain
counterland operations. Air and surface-launched cruise missiles can also be employed
for interdiction, as can the ATACMS. In multinational coalitions, air forces from allied
nations will usually be available for counterland employment.
       Regardless of which component the assets come from, the counterland effort is
guided by a single air and space component commander and directly supports the
overall joint campaign. Centralized control is a fundamental tenet that commanders
must exercise to guarantee the concentration of air and space power where it is needed
most. The CFACC is normally the supported commander for the JFC’s overall AI effort.
When designated as the supported commander, the CFACC will conduct theater-wide
or JOA-wide AI in direct support of the JFC’s overall theater objectives. This functional


                                            9
responsibility is executed by engaging the enemy across the theater wherever valuable
AI targets are found, to include those found inside a surface area of operations (AO). AI
used in this manner tends to have the greatest overall effect on the enemy, but the
results may be delayed in comparison with AI employed closer to the ground battle. If
theater objectives dictate, AI may operate in support of a particular portion of the theater
where it is more closely integrated with the ground battle. This form of AI may strike
targets nominated through the joint targeting process by either the air or surface
component and often produces results visible to the surface commander more quickly
than a theater-wide AI effort. These results also tend to be smaller in scope and shorter
in duration. The most detailed integration of air and ground components is found in
CAS where the air attack and ground battle are essentially a single cohesive operation.
Proper integration of counterland and surface operations is vital to the success of both,
and the synergistic effect of integrated operations is often much greater than the sum of
individual air and surface operations. This will be especially true if a single, integrated
joint operations plan is employed instead of attempting to synchronize individual plans
developed by the various components.
       The Airman’s perception of depth differs from that of the Soldier, in that air and
space power can reach to any depth of the battlespace—from the close battle area back
to and beyond the enemy’s heartland. As an aerial maneuver force, counterland
operations forces should not be considered as “flying artillery.” Counterland assets
have much greater range and targeting options; can adapt to changing situations while
en route to the target area; can retarget based on onboard or offboard information
updates; can fight their way through enemy defenses; and can orbit over a given area
while reconnoitering for targets of opportunity. Depending on the designated strategy,
air and space power’s reach enables a commander to focus counterland effects in a
small area or disperse them uniformly across the theater at whatever depth is required.
While in some instances it may be appropriate for the joint air component to be given
responsibility for an AO, such as western Iraq during Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, it
should not be limited to a single or even multiple independent AOs. Joint doctrine
confirms this view by stating that AOs are defined by the JFC for land, maritime, and
special operations forces for use by land, naval, and special operations component
commanders (See JP 3-0, Doctrine for Joint Operations).
       Air and surface maneuver forces share supporting roles during counterland
operations. CAS represents aerial maneuver in direct support of surface maneuver. Air
attack of ground-nominated AI targets is aerial maneuver indirectly supporting ground
maneuver. Air attack against theater-wide AI targets is aerial maneuver that either
provides general support to the ground force or directly achieves JFC objectives.
Indeed, in some circumstances ground maneuver may support aerial maneuver by
forcing the enemy into a position that is more vulnerable to air attack, enabling air and
space power to deliver a vital blow. Moreover, SOF have proven extremely effective for
target identification and cueing, as was the case during Operations ENDURING
FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM. In those unusual circumstances in which air and
space forces conduct AI in the absence of friendly surface forces, enemy forces are
able to disperse and seek cover in a way that complicates the problem for Airmen.
However, as was shown in Operation ALLIED FORCE, air and space power can still


                                            10
create decisive effects and lead to success for the joint force. Whether air, space, or
surface forces are the decisive element is not what matters. Instead, it is important to
realize that the proper integration of air, space, and surface forces is required for
successful joint operations.
       Fires are “the effects of lethal or nonlethal weapons.” Joint fires are “fires
produced during the employment of forces from two or more components in coordinated
action toward a common objective” (JP 1-02, DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated
Terms). Counterland itself is not joint fires; rather, it represents a form of aerial
maneuver, which delivers fires on various targets as required. Those counterland
missions that are apportioned to support another component, such as CAS and some
AI, can be defined as meeting the description of “two or more components in
coordinated action.” Therefore, the application of these missions can be called joint
fires. Those missions that operate in direct support of theater strategy, such as theater-
wide AI, are not operating in “coordinated action” with another component, rather they
are conducting missions with organic forces in support of a scheme of maneuver.
Therefore, the fires produced by those missions are not joint fires.

ELEMENTS OF EFFECTIVE COUNTERLAND OPERATIONS
        Effective counterland operations share a number of common elements that lead
to the attainment of operational objectives, such as destruction of enemy forces or
infrastructure. To what degree each will contribute to the operation depends on such
variables as the nature of the conflict, geographic location, weather, and characteristics
of the enemy.

Air Control
       Successful counterland operations require a certain degree of freedom to act
without enemy interference. Providing both the freedom to attack and freedom from
attack, air superiority is that degree of air advantage possessed by one force over
another that permits the conduct of operations in the air domain at a given time and
place without prohibitive interference by the opposing force. Air superiority over
counterland operations allows combat aircraft to focus on target acquisition and
weapons delivery parameters, thus increasing the chances of achieving desired effects.

       Air supremacy is an additional degree of air control, where the opposing force is
incapable of effective interference in the air domain. While this level of control is
desirable in the air domain, it may not be required for successful counterland
operations, and may be too costly in terms of asset apportionment. Assets dedicated to
air supremacy may be used more wisely in support of land forces or other JFC
objectives, if the level of interference by opposing air assets is acceptable or negligible.

        While air supremacy relates to the air domain, air dominance is the highest
level of air control that allows us to focus on affecting surface events. Air dominance
does not require unopposed use of the air domain, but indicates a level or control in the
air that allows us to apportion assets against surface objectives, reducing the ability of


                                            11
enemy forces to effectively employ on land or sea. In other words, air control describes
our level of ascendancy in the air domain, while air dominance goes further to describe
how we use that level of air control to affect enemy surface forces.

        Although some aircraft are capable of self defense, gaining air superiority before
conducting counterland operations will increase the chances of mission success without
excessive losses. Stealth technology offers a means of minimizing much of the enemy
air threat when air superiority is in dispute and may allow some counterland operations
even in the face of heavy enemy air defenses. Multi-role fighters have significant air-to-
air capabilities that can serve as a defense against enemy air threats even while
carrying a full load of air-to-ground weapons. However, whether stealth or self-escorted
fighter, attack assets are likely to be prioritized against counterair targets until air
superiority is achieved.

      The risk of conducting counterland operations prior to achieving air superiority
must be balanced with the threat posed by the enemy air and surface forces.
Counterland operations conducted prior to achieving air superiority should normally be
reserved for those targets that represent immediate and critical danger.

Joint Integration and Complementary Operations
        Counterland operations are most effective when planned and conducted
synergistically with other air, land, sea, space, and special operations forces. AI can
create opportunities for commanders to exploit, and centralized joint planning ensures
the optimum employment of AI. AI levies requirements on air planners and combined
air and space operations center (CAOC) personnel to plan, execute, and assess AI in
coordination with surface components, when appropriate. Air and surface commanders
need to work together to: 1) identify crucial targets; 2) decide when, where, and how to
attack them; and 3) determine how surface operations and AI can best complement
each other to achieve JFC objectives and to create opportunities for other maneuver
elements to exploit. The integration of several other air and space power functions can
significantly contribute to the effectiveness of counterland operations.

          Counterair operations enable the effective execution of counterland
          operations by suppressing or eliminating surface-to-air and air-to-air threats.
          Though it is possible to conduct counterland operations without control of the
          air, such operations would likely be both costly and ineffective.

          Strategic Attack and counterland operations complement one another
          through their synergistic effects. Strategic attack operations directly target
          enemy centers of gravity such as leadership, conflict-sustaining resources,
          and/or strategy. Targets may include strategic C2 nodes, munitions plants,
          heavy industry, energy production, or weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
          Thus, in one sense, strategic attack disrupts or destroys such targets at the
          source, while counterland operations normally target operational fielded
          forces and their supporting infrastructure in the field.




                                           12
Strategic interdiction is a label often used for those strategic attack operations that
seek to cut off the flow of strategic resources or other material vital to the
adversary’s war effort. This type of interdiction differs from the more familiar
counterland AI in that enemy fielded forces or their supporting infrastructure are not
directly involved. A good example of strategic interdiction was the effort by US
submarines, joined later by US Army Air Force bombers and fighters, against
Japanese merchant shipping during World War II.

      Space Force Enhancement multiplies the effectiveness and increases the
      lethality of counterland forces through five force enhancement functions:
      intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; integrated tactical warning and
      attack assessment; environmental monitoring; communications; and
      positioning, navigation, and timing. ISR provides location and disposition of
      adversary assets as well as tactical BDA. Environmental monitoring provides
      meteorological data as well as imagery of surface conditions, vegetation and
      land use. Communications allows counterland forces the means to
      disseminate plans, orders and force status over long distances, and provides
      critical connectivity for maneuver forces operating beyond inherent
      communication networks. Finally, the global positioning system (GPS)
      constellation allows precise, reliable blue force tracking, navigation of forces,
      combat identification, and target weaponeering for precision munitions.

      Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance serves a vital role in the
      planning and prosecution of counterland operations. Persistent, accurate,
      and timely intelligence aids commanders in anticipating environmental factors,
      predicting enemy actions, identifying counterland targets, and combat
      assessment.

      Information Operations (IO) targeted against enemy information systems
      can have collateral effects on the entire enemy system through the disruption,
      degradation, denial, and destruction of its C2 networks. Effective IO can
      deceive the enemy and assist friendly forces to seize the initiative.
      Additionally, the synergistic effects of psychological operations (PSYOP)
      conducted in parallel with counterland operations combine to give the air
      component a pivotal role in achieving the overall goals of any joint campaign.
      The psychological shock of massed air attack and information operations can
      be overwhelming to the enemy’s fielded forces, especially when those forces
      have already been strained by surface combat. Public affairs (PA) also play a
      role in IO. Effective employment of PA operations keeps global audiences
      aware of the precision and effectiveness of counterland operations via the
      news media. PA operations are the first line of defense against enemy efforts
      to leverage collateral damage or fratricide events for propaganda purposes.

      Special Operations Forces (SOF) complement and support conventional
      counterland operations by providing intelligence, target cueing, terminal
      attack control, guidance for precision-guided munitions (PGMs), and post



                                        13
          attack assessment. SOF may also employ organic weapons systems such as
          fixed or rotary-winged gunships, and special operations ground teams.

          Weather Services provide timely, accurate, and relevant environmental
          information essential to the effective planning and execution of air, ground,
          and space operations. Weather information influences the timing of force
          employment as well as the selection of targets, routes, weapon systems and
          delivery tactics.

Appropriate Munitions, Assets, and Allocation
       Proper munitions planning and employment are important factors for effective
counterland operations. Numbers and types of munitions available, as well as those in
the logistics pipeline, need to support specific requirements for a particular conflict. The
munitions mix must correspond to the selected targeting strategy. Weapons loads and
fuse settings should be tailored to the desired level of target destruction, neutralization,
or suppression. Although precision munitions have become a primary weapon of
choice, planners should realize that general-purpose bombs and cluster munitions may
provide better effects in some situations. Planners should also consider the possibility
of adverse weapons effects against friendly forces, such as the employment of time-
delayed munitions against an enemy near advancing friendly forces. Precision
munitions are uniquely valuable in attacking hardened point targets or for minimizing
collateral damage. These highly accurate direct attack munitions provide rapid strike
capability with maximum flexibility, while standoff precision weapons allow delivery
platforms to remain outside the most heavily defended areas with nearly the same
accuracies. Precision attack of key infrastructure, transportation, and C2 targets can
cripple an enemy force’s ability to maneuver, and has usually been the preferred use of
limited PGM assets rather than attacking the enemy one vehicle at a time. However,
with increased stockpiles, PGMs and inertially-aided munitions (IAMs) are particularly
useful against a mechanized enemy force that places most of its combat power in
various types of vehicles. If the number of precision munitions and aircraft available is
high enough, counterland operations can inflict devastating losses on a mechanized
enemy force through the simple expedient of vehicle-by-vehicle destruction. However,
such a strategy of attrition must be considered in terms of both number of weapons
required and the possible existence of more lucrative target sets and the time required
to destroy enough of the enemy force to be operationally effective.

       The CFACC’s ability to conduct counterland operations successfully depends on
the available type and quantity of air and space assets. Precision weapons delivery,
stealth characteristics, and destructive power, combined with the inherent capability of
the air and space component to mass effects against a given objective, can provide a
substitute for raw numbers. The principles of mass and economy of force should be
followed to ensure that adequate force is available to achieve the desired effects.
Though many platforms can employ in the AI and CAS roles, some are better suited for
each mission from both a training and equipment standpoint. In addition, it is important
to understand that some units employing air-to-ground ordnance are not qualified for
CAS, which has specific training and currency requirements. Commanders should


                                            14
carefully assess the desired munitions effects, aircrew training, and asset capabilities in
light of the potential for fratricide.

        Commanders           should       also
understand the impact that AI/CAS
allocation has on sortie throughput to
increase counterland efficiency. During
high-intensity       operations,      effective
integration    between      air    and    land
components       increases       tempo     and
efficiency. Because CAS requires detailed
integration, the communications and
procedures are much more involved than
AI. Therefore, CAS execution tends to
require more time, resources, and trained              Night attack capability for
personnel. Because of these factors, C2         counterland has progressed from the

does not imply that the Air Force should
divert its assets and abandon ground
forces. It simply means the air and ground components should coordinate their actions
to maximize combat power throughout the battlefield.

Favorable Environmental Factors
        Some argue that recent technologies have eliminated the sanctuaries of adverse
weather and darkness. In some respects, this is true. The adverse effects of weather
can be reduced through a combination of IAMs and on-board sensors that do not
require optical guidance. GPS-assisted joint direct attack munitions (JDAM) and radar
sensors can aid the weapons delivery process in conditions of poor visibility. During
night operations, modern air-to-ground infrared (IR) systems often see better in
darkness than in daylight, and night can make many enemy air defense systems less
effective against counterland aircraft (especially attack helicopters which are typically
limited to low altitude operations).
       Despite technological advancements, poor environmental conditions can still
negatively affect counterland operations. Some forms of adverse weather can interfere
with the ability of airpower assets to reach the intended target while often hindering both
detection and attack geometry. Many precision-guided weapons still rely on line of sight


                                            15
to the target for employment; conditions such as fog, low clouds, or battlefield
obscuration can prevent visual contact and disrupt weapons delivery. Target
identification is a critical factor when employing weapons in close proximity to ground
forces.
       Favorable weather is important to effective CAS, perhaps more so than other
forms of air attack. Since identification of the target through visual or electro-optical
means is usually required for target confirmation and fratricide avoidance, a low cloud
deck can often prevent CAS missions from hitting their targets. Non-visual weapons
deliveries using radar, GPS, or IAMs may allow CAS aircraft to hit stationary targets
through the weather, but target coordinate accuracy will have to be confirmed to both
the air and ground component’s satisfaction before this option is used. This is
especially important when assessing the risk of fratricide. The ground commander
authorizes the attack and accepts responsibility of risk to friendly forces while the
CFACC determines the minimum acceptable weather for CAS. In the absence of Air
Force weather personnel, the air liaison officer (ALO) should advise the ground
commander on what impact adverse weather will have on CAS. Although advanced
navigation systems and targeting sensors lessen the consequences of adverse
environmental conditions, technology will never completely alleviate the risk of fratricide
or collateral damage. Individual controllers and aircrew must make the final call during
mission execution if existing weather is above or below their mission minimums.
       Environmental factors also affect surface forces. The rate and extent of enemy
surface maneuver influenced by weather conditions may provide increased AI
opportunities (for example, when enemy maneuver is restricted to a few major routes by
seasonal conditions, it results in concentrated forces which are more easily destroyed or
disrupted). Planners should use information from C2 systems or weather personnel to
help gauge the effect of weather and environmental conditions on counterland
operations.

SUMMARY
        Counterland can play a key role in the successful outcome of a campaign or
major operation across the range of military operations. Counterland operations require
close integration with the JFC’s overall strategy to be effective and must be tailored to
the situation. Counterland may achieve tactical, operational, or strategic level effects.
Counterland can complement, support, be supported by, or act independently of other
joint force operations. Because air and space assets are a limited resource, joint
counterland operations require unity of effort to achieve the desired synergy to achieve
JFC objectives.

                    GENESIS OF COUNTERLAND DOCTRINE

       In theory and in practice, air support aircraft in 1918 had two categories of
targets: objectives along the enemy’s heavily defended frontal positions, which
some generals called the “crust,” and a whole range of targets extending twenty
miles and more behind that crust. By the end of the war, a considerable body of
opinion held that the chief contribution of aircraft should be against those objectives
behind that crust. Enemy reinforcements moving up in column were much more
visible and much more vulnerable than front-line troops in field fortifications, and
there was less danger of confusing them with friendly ground forces. Then too,
objectives behind the front lines tended to be less fiercely defended—no minor
consideration, given the losses suffered by ground attack units. Additionally,
excellent targets often lay beyond the effective range of friendly artillery, in a zone
where only the airplane could reach them. Toward the end of the war, targets such
as dense troop columns and convoys of vehicles appeared in great numbers.

 World War I pursuits like this SPAD XIII were often used for both “trench
 strafing” and “ground strafing” missions, which would today be categorized as
 close air support and air interdiction.

             The disruption of hostile lines of communication (and at times lines
       of signal communication), the destruction of supply dumps, installations,
       and the attack on hostile troop concentrations in rear areas will cause the
       enemy great damage and may decide the battle.

DEFINITION
        AI is an air operation conducted to divert, disrupt, delay, or destroy the enemy’s
military potential before it can be brought to bear effectively against friendly forces, or to
otherwise achieve JFC objectives. AI is conducted at such distance from friendly forces
that detailed integration of each air mission with the fire and movement of friendly forces
is not required. AI can significantly affect the overall course of a campaign. It
contributes by disrupting the enemy's ability to command, mass, maneuver, withdraw,
supply, and reinforce available combat power and by weakening the enemy physically
and psychologically. AI creates opportunities for friendly commanders to exploit.

        AI increases air and space power’s efficiency because it does not require
detailed integration with friendly forces. Detailed integration requires extensive
communications, comprehensive deconfliction procedures, and meticulous planning. AI
is inherently simpler to execute in this regard. Therefore, if the enemy surface force
presents a lucrative target, AI conducted before friendly land forces make contact can
significantly degrade the enemy’s fighting ability and limit the need for CAS when the
two forces meet in close combat.

       The joint air component often conducts theater-wide air attacks against enemy
land forces and their resources to achieve JFC objectives. This autonomous use of AI
usually occurs outside of a surface component’s AO. SOF air and ground assets may
play a significant supporting role during AI with their ability to seamlessly integrate into
the F2T2EA process. Operations DESERT STORM, ENDURING FREEDOM, and
IRAQI FREEDOM are just a few modern examples where AI independently achieved
JFC objectives through the direct attack of enemy land forces.

       Using JFC priorities and understanding the land component’s scheme of
maneuver, the CFACC can employ AI to provide effects that facilitate and support the
maneuver. The CFACC may support a land scheme of maneuver by conducting AI
within a surface commander’s AO. After coordinating priorities, effects, timing, and
targets with surface components, the CFACC directs responsive AI across the JOA
against enemy military capabilities that contribute directly to, or are maneuvering to
reinforce, the conflict. US surface commanders often consider AI synonymous with
what they express as “shaping” operations. From an Airman’s perspective, shaping



                                             18
may be regarded as preparing the battlefield with AI to assist the land component’s
scheme of maneuver.

                       Air Interdiction vs. Shaping Operations
        From a Soldier's perspective, shaping operations support the decisive
operation by affecting enemy capabilities and forces, or by influencing enemy
decisions. Shaping operations use all elements of combat power to neutralize or
reduce enemy capabilities. (US Army Field Manual 3-0, Operations) As a result,
Soldiers may consider AI as shaping which solely supports their maneuver elements.
From an Airman's perspective, AI may be conducted either in support of surface
force objectives or in direct support of JFC objectives; in the latter case, the air
component commander might be the supported commander. Because of these
slightly differing views, there is a potential for friction between the air and land
components regarding supporting/supported roles and responsibility for planning.
These situations require careful and continuing dialogue between the competing
senior commanders and their common superior commander.



INTERDICTION OBJECTIVES

        The desired objectives of AI are to divert, disrupt, delay, or destroy the enemy. It
is not necessary for an AI operation to focus solely on a single objective; in fact, AI
typically inflicts multiple effects on the enemy. The enemy army traveling to the front
while under air attack will suffer some level of destruction. The remaining force will
likely be delayed in getting to its destination and will suffer some level of physical and
psychological disruption.

Divert

        AI can divert enemy fielded forces from areas where they are critically needed. It
may divert enemy ground forces to a location more favorable to the JFC and can also
divert enemy naval, engineering, and personnel resources to the tasks of repairing and
recovering damaged equipment and facilities as well as keeping lines of communication
(LOCs) open. These diversions prevent enemy ground forces and their backup support
resources from being employed for their intended purpose. Diversions can also cause
circuitous routing along LOCs, resulting in additional delays for the enemy.

Disrupt

       AI can disrupt the enemy’s C2 systems, intelligence collection capability,
transportation systems, supply lines, and psychological will. Disruption of enemy
surface forces can be accomplished in a number of ways. A key part of the interdiction
planner’s task is to analyze the enemy army for critical vulnerabilities that, if attacked,
will have a disruptive effect across significant portions of the enemy force. The
presence of such targets, and the ability to attack them, will often determine whether


                                            19
disruption or destruction will be the primary effect mechanism planned for AI effort. This
can include traditional supply targets such as ammunition or petroleum, oil, and
lubricants (POL); LOCs used to transport the enemy force into combat; C2 systems that
the enemy army requires to fight effectively; or anything else the enemy force depends
on for success in combat. In analyzing the enemy, considerations include what
reserves or workarounds the enemy has available, what time delay can be afforded
before the effects must affect the enemy, what strategy the enemy is expected to
employ, and what the actual battlefield situation is. Another way to neutralize the
enemy surface force is to affect the morale of its troops, which has historically been a
strongpoint of using airpower. Psychological uncertainty as to whether or not forces,
materiel, or supplies will arrive can directly affect enemy commanders, their staffs, and
forces.

Delay

        AI can delay enemy forces and supplies. If part of the enemy surface force is
destroyed, the enemy’s efforts to avoid having the rest of its force suffer the same fate
will often result in long delays or an outright halt to their movement to contact. When AI
delays the enemy, friendly forces gain time. What JFCs do to improve their situation in
the time gained is critical to any assessment of interdiction’s contribution. However, an
AI plan that focuses on delay does not guarantee a major impact on combat operations.
In order for delay to have a major impact, either the enemy must face urgent movement
requirements in support of its own operations or to counter friendly maneuver, or the
delay must enhance the effect of planned friendly maneuver. It is advantageous for
friendly forces to pressure their opponent to attempt urgent movement. Ideally, if the air
component maintains the initiative, the opponent is forced to make unplanned urgent
movements at times and places that maximize their exposure to AI. Delay is critical in
achieving additional AI payoffs. For example, it can lengthen the time during which
enemy land or naval forces are at risk of attack. When vehicles amass behind a
damaged route segment, or ships are trapped in a harbor because of mines, a more
concentrated set of targets and a longer period of exposure results. This makes the
enemy easier to destroy or renders it ineffective.

Destroy

        Destruction of the enemy surface force, supporting elements, and supplies is the
most direct of the four objectives of AI. The enemy’s perception of its imminent
destruction can be as effective in achieving AI objectives as physically destroying target
systems, if it causes the enemy to react in a way upon which friendly forces can
capitalize. Destroying transportation systems is usually not an end in itself, but
contributes to the delay, diversion, and disruption of enemy forces and materiel. The
demonstrated or perceived ability to destroy may, by itself, achieve substantial delay
and diversion of enemy resources. It may cause the enemy to move only at night or to
mass air defense assets (which may be useful elsewhere) around critical transportation
nodes. The enemy may have to divert engineering resources from other tasks to
prepare alternate routes in anticipation of possible attacks. This may be true when


                                           20
transportation systems remain largely undamaged. However, destruction may also
inhibit friendly freedom of action. For example, destruction of key transportation targets
could hinder future surface operations that intend to use the same infrastructure.
Appropriate coordination of AI with other joint force components helps preserve friendly
freedom of action.

EFFECTS OF AIR INTERDICTION

       AI effects differ with every situation and can significantly affect the course of a
campaign or operation. Results against an enemy with minimal logistics requirements,
a simple force structure, and primitive logistics systems differ from AI conducted against
a highly mechanized, modern force possessing intensive logistics requirements.
Interdiction conducted against enemy forces and logistics, without regard to the overall
theater situation, may be largely ineffective; thus planning for interdiction should be
closely integrated in the JFC’s overall planning process.

        The effectiveness of AI is largely dependent on a number of variables. The time
required for AI to affect the enemy, and the duration and depth of those effects,
depends on several factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the distance
between interdiction operations and the location of intended effects; the means and rate
of enemy movement (ships, trains, aircraft, trucks); the physical target (forces, supplies,
fuel, munitions, infrastructure); the level of enemy activity; enemy tactics; and the
resilience of the targeted force or system. For example, AI will have a more robust
effect in linear combat against a modern, mobile, conventional force using significant
resources. Moreover, the timing and magnitude of effects will vary depending on where
AI is conducted and the nature of the enemy. On one hand, AI deep in the battlespace
will usually produce extensive, protracted effects that take longer to occur. On the other
hand, AI close to the front lines typically produces immediate, but geographically limited,
effects. Thus, during major operations and campaigns, AI effects are typically more
apparent by influencing an enemy’s ability to command, mass, maneuver, supply, and
reinforce available conventional combat forces. When conducted during stability
operations, AI may have negligible effects against an insurrection that employs a
shadowy force structure, a simple logistics net, and unconventional tactics. However,
with timely, accurate intelligence and persistent operations, AI can disrupt enemy supply
operations, destroy weapons caches, or deny sanctuary to insurgents. To maximize
AI’s potential, commanders must understand how its effects will differ depending on the
nature of the conflict being fought.

      Whether the Air Force is involved in major operations and campaigns or smaller
scale contingencies, AI can channel movements, constrict logistics systems,
disrupt communications, force urgent movement, and attrit enemy fielded forces.

        Disruptive Counterland Operations During DESERT STORM

        Even Iraqis who had foreseen heavy air attacks commented that the
Coalition bombing was more continuous, devastating, and wide-scale than what
they had expected. The round-the-clock bombing experienced by some units
during portions of the air campaign proved particularly stressful for both officers
and enlisted personnel because it deprived them of sleep and allowed them little
opportunity to perform their duties. One senior officer reported that he could
rarely sleep more than two hours at a time and that the constant pounding
shattered the soldiers’ nerves, causing some men, as he put it, nearly to go
mad. The bombing produced this strong psychological effect even though it
caused the Iraqi officer’s division relatively light casualties: perhaps 100 men
killed and another 150 wounded.




       The magnitude of the B-52 bomb loads had a tremendous psychological
effect on the Iraqi troops. Even though few Iraqi POWs or line crossers
reported that their units were actually hit in B-52 strikes, many had seen B-52s
attacking other units in the distance and had felt the ground tremors from B-52
bomb detonations. The sound and vibrations of the B-52 detonations—even
when the actual strike zone was as far away as 40 kilometers—spawned
suspense and fear because the soldiers imagined that they would be the next
target of attack, and they realized that their bunkers were neither sufficiently
deep nor sufficiently hard to protect them.
       An Iraqi officer told his interrogator that he had surrendered because of
B-52 strikes. “But your position was never attacked by B-52s,” his interrogator
exclaimed. “That is true,” the Iraqi officer replied, “but I saw one that had been
attacked.”

       Psychological Effects of US Air Operations in Four Wars: 1941-1991




                                        22
Channeling Enemy Movements
        AI channels the movement of ground forces when conditions force the enemy to
maneuver through or along predictable avenues. This generally results from the lack of
transportation routes, manmade and natural obstacles, and other geographic
constraints.     The fewer the routes available to transport enemy supplies and
reinforcements, the greater the loss or delay caused by severing those routes. Attacks
on enemy lateral LOCs can channel movement, impair reinforcement, reduce
operational cohesion, and create conditions for defeating the enemy in detail.
Geography influences the rate of enemy movement, the size of the force to be moved,
where it can move, and the means required to move the force. Geography may also
restrict or channel ground movement, creating chokepoints and concentrated targets.
In cases where geography favors rapid movement of enemy forces, AI assets can
create artificial or temporary chokepoints by laying large numbers of scatterable mines,
dropping bridges, or collapsing tunnels.

        Air component planners must coordinate the AI effort with the land component’s
overall scheme of maneuver. LOCs used by the enemy may also facilitate rapid
advance of our own ground forces, requiring properly coordinated trade-offs between
interdicting the enemy and preserving key routes for advancing friendly ground units.

Constricting the Enemy’s Logistics System
        Heavy ground combat creates demands on enemy fielded forces and speeds
consumption of vital war materiel. This in turn increases the effects of AI operations by
straining the enemy support system and reducing stockpiles. For surface combat to
take place, soldiers and their weapons, ammunition, food, fuel, and communications
must get to the battle. When the enemy consumes large quantities of supplies because
of heavy combat or extensive movement, interdiction operations have an accelerated
impact for two reasons. First, when opponents are under heavy pressure, they may be
forced to use up stockpiles reserved for ongoing or future operations. Inability to
stockpile supplies makes it more difficult for the enemy to initiate large-scale offensive
operations. Second, high consumption drives an enemy to use more direct routes,
making them more vulnerable to interdiction attacks. The nature of ground combat also
determines which supporting elements are most critical at any given time, as which
items of supply and infrastructure are critical can vary greatly with the situation.
Historically, an enemy army fighting under static conditions is more affected by the
destruction of munitions, while a highly mobile enemy is more disrupted by the loss of
fuel and transportation.

       The less surplus capacity the enemy’s logistics system has, the less it can
compensate for damage. Degrading the mobility of the enemy’s distribution system
hinders its ability to redistribute assets to effectively counter friendly operations. When
attacking the enemy’s logistic systems, it is normally prudent to concentrate efforts on a
small number of limiting factors such as concentrations of supplies; petroleum, oils, and
lubricants; storage and resupply systems; or soft vehicles. There may not be enough



                                            23
interdiction assets to attack all of an enemy’s logistic systems, even sequentially over
time.

        The enemy transportation system itself must also be broken down into
components when analyzing for weaknesses to attack. Most transportation systems
consist of the actual conduit for travel (roads, rail, etc.), vehicles used to transport
troops or supplies along the conduit, energy required for those vehicles to operate
(typically POL or electricity), C2 to run the transportation system, and repair facilities to
keep the system operating. The loading and unloading points in the transportation
system may prove especially lucrative, as large concentrations of enemy forces or
supplies are often found there. Examples include rail yards, harbors, and airfields. If
forces or supplies are critically needed at the front, the enemy may not have the luxury
of dispersing them during loading or unloading, which increases vulnerability to attack.
Moreover, environmental impacts on the transportation system can create additional
chokepoints worth exploiting.         In many cases, the enemy will use the same
transportation system for both forces and supplies. Under such circumstances,
destroying or degrading the enemy’s LOCs will affect both their force mobility and
resupply capability. When analyzing an enemy transportation network for importance to
their overall strategy, all possible uses for such a system must be considered. Before
making the decision to interdict the enemy’s transportation network, it must be analyzed
for surplus capacity and reconstitution capability. Failure to do this has sometimes led
to large-scale AI efforts that had little real chance of success (e.g., the limited
effectiveness in halting activity on the Ho Chi Minh Trail during the Vietnam War).

Disrupting Enemy Communications
         The enemy’s combat operations may be disrupted with attacks on their C2
nodes; the level of C2 disruption must be commensurate with overall objectives. C2
attacks may seek complete isolation of enemy combat forces from higher headquarters,
or such attacks may force the enemy to use less capable, less secure backup
communication systems that can be more easily exploited by friendly forces. When the
enemy employs a rigid, top-down C2 doctrine, they can be particularly vulnerable to the
disruptive effects of C2 interdiction. This is especially true when the enemy has not had
a long preparation period to exercise their plan, or when the conflict has moved beyond
the initial stages. Conversely, an enemy that practices a high degree of C2 autonomy
will likely be less affected by attacks on their C2 network. When the ground situation
has been static for long periods before the campaign, chances are greater that the
enemy has planned and trained for either offensive or defensive operations. Under
such circumstances, attacks on enemy C2 are less likely to have significant effects, as
the enemy is still able to react in a scripted manner. Once enough time has elapsed for
events to overcome a preplanned enemy response, attacks on C2 will impair their ability
to respond and pay larger dividends on the battlefield. In some circumstances, such as
when the operations plan includes forcing the enemy to react to friendly maneuver,
complete destruction of their C2 architecture would be counterproductive. The
capability to affect the enemy through nonlethal information operations must also be
considered, as this approach may lead to better overall results while freeing up
conventional attack assets for other forms of AI.


                                             24
Forcing Urgent Movement Upon the Enemy
        The enemy may execute urgent movement for several reasons: an attempt to
achieve surprise, the need to attack before reinforcements or supplies arrive, the
requirement for rapid reinforcement of threatened defensive positions, the attempt to
exploit offensive operations, or when driven to urgent movement by interdiction effects.
Under these conditions, the enemy has a strong incentive to attain specific objectives
within time constraints. Rapid movement of enemy forces and supplies may make them
more vulnerable to AI. They generally become more concentrated while traversing
more exposed and predictable avenues, foregoing time-consuming camouflage and
concealment efforts. However, urgent movements are temporary due to a desire to limit
exposure. For friendly forces to capitalize on such opportunities, we must deny the
enemy mobility when they need it most. Close coordination is required among all forces
to take full advantage of the situation. Additionally, commanders require access to
information systems able to process real-time and near real-time intelligence in order to
exploit the capabilities of interdiction and opportunities that AI operations create.
Friendly forces must take full advantage of all reconnaissance and surveillance assets,
from air- and space-borne sensors to SOF air and ground elements, to detect when
these movements occur. Coordination is required among all forces to take full
advantage of the situation in the time provided; otherwise, the enemy may escape the
desired effects of AI.

Attrition of the Enemy
        AI can attrit enemy forces and materiel, tipping the balance of forces in favor of
friendly units. AI against enemy fielded forces has traditionally been more limited than
the other effects, mainly due to the difficulty of finding and targeting individual guns or
vehicles. Although modern sensor and weapons technology enables us to more
accurately engage enemy targets, commanders must not be lulled into the belief that
this will assure the direct destruction of enemy forces. Resources, terrain, weather,
enemy actions, and enemy characteristics are just a few variables to consider when
developing an AI strategy.

         The fact that directly attacking individual enemy forces is possible does not mean
that it is always the most efficient approach in terms of munitions and sorties available.
Although the direct destruction of individual enemy forces has an immediate impact on
enemy combat power, it usually requires more assets due to the larger number of
individual targets—especially if they are dispersed or dug in. Often, the isolation of
large enemy formations by destroying enemy logistics nets, sustaining resources, and
supporting infrastructure can achieve more widespread results than attacking individual
tanks or artillery pieces.

      Terrain and weather affect the ability to attrit enemy forces. Attacking an enemy
in open terrain in good weather significantly differs from striking an enemy in rough
wooded terrain under a layer of adverse weather. As an example, exposed Iraqi forces
were much easier AI targets for coalition airpower during Operation DESERT STORM



                                            25
than dispersed Serbian forces that took cover using trees, valleys, and adverse weather
conditions during Operation ALLIED FORCE.

       Enemy characteristics influence an attrition-based strategy. The number and
vulnerability of enemy fielded force components, along with the enemy’s ability to
replace its losses, must be weighed against the expected results of targeting the
supporting infrastructure. An attrition-based strategy against enemy fielded forces
tends to produce intense localized results with fewer disruptive effects across the entire
enemy system. Psychologically disruptive effects, however, may prove to be an added
benefit. Enemy movement also influences the ability to destroy enemy fielded forces.
During DESERT STORM and IRAQI FREEDOM, the presence of coalition land forces
forced the enemy to react en masse, leaving them detectable and exposed to air attack.
However, because Operation ALLIED FORCE saw no use of significant coalition land
forces, the Serbs were able to use dispersion, deception, and concealment tactics.
Thus, friendly ground maneuver that forces an enemy to react and become predictable
can make an attrition strategy viable and more effective. Retreating enemy forces
remain a legitimate target in AI operations as such forces may be available for continual
use by the opposing commander. However, surrendering (or surrendered) forces are
not legitimate targets, if it has been established that such forces are surrendering, and
the attacking force is in a position to know of the surrender.

TYPES OF AIR INTERDICTION REQUESTS
        AI requests fall into two categories: preplanned and immediate. Each type of
request is influenced by a variety of factors. Unless time constraints dictate otherwise,
preplanned requests should always be accomplished to allow for proper weapon-target
combination, target area tactics planning, threat avoidance, weather study, and other
variables, to maximize the probability of target destruction with minimum losses.
Attacking mobile or short-notice targets provides a more flexible response that can
capitalize on opportunities, but lack of mission planning can reduce effectiveness and
higher friendly losses may be expected. Real-time information technology and digital
cockpit imagery reduces, but does not eliminate, this factor.

Preplanned Requests
       Preplanned AI is the normal method of operation in which aircraft attack
prearranged or planned targets. This mode is used to hit specific targets that are known
in advance, and detailed intelligence information is available to support strike planning.
Preplanned attacks are normally flown against fixed targets or against mobile targets
that are not expected to move in the interval between planning and execution (e.g.,
revetted tanks). Target information for scheduled AI can come from sources that vary
from overhead reconnaissance to ground-based SOF. Preplanned AI is conducted
within the normal air tasking cycle and provides enough time for close coordination with
other joint force components. It is crucial for component liaisons to communicate and
work together to facilitate centralized planning and effective integration, and avoid
duplicating effort. Preplanned AI requests evolve into scheduled and on-call missions.



                                           26
          Scheduled missions are planned against targets on which air attacks are
          delivered at a specific time.

          On-call missions are planned against targets other than scheduled missions
          for which a need can be anticipated but which will be delivered upon request
          rather than a specific time.

        On-call AI missions can produce responsive, flexible effects. In cases where a
specific area to search for enemy AI targets cannot be predetermined, these missions
are designated as XAI or GAI on the ATO and may be put on an airborne alert status.
The appropriate C2 agency provides guidance to a specific target, kill box, or target
area. XAI missions will normally be given a target priority list or other guidance defining
which targets to attack for greatest disruption of the enemy. This set of target priorities
may be available prior to takeoff, or may be passed in flight by an appropriate C2
agency such as a forward air controller (FAC), a SCAR, an air support operations center
(ASOC), an AWACS, or an E-8 JSTARS. If no targets are discovered in the designated
area, XAI missions should be prepared to proceed to a backup target if available or
requested by the designated controlling agency. Planners should attempt to match
proper weapons loads with expected target types to maximize XAI effects. When
flexible AI is flown in direct support of the surface component, the target priorities should
reflect those established by the surface component and communicated via the
appropriate component liaison officer (LNO) within the theater air-ground system
(TAGS). The ASOC normally coordinates and directs preplanned AI requests flown
short of the fire support coordination line (FSCL).

Immediate Requests
        Immediate AI meets specific requests which arise during the course of a battle
and which by their sudden nature are not planned in accordance with the normal ATO
process. Immediate AI requests can respond to unplanned or unanticipated targets that
require urgent, time-critical attention. It should be noted that many immediate requests
for AI allow sufficient time for in-depth planning prior to execution even if those requests
fall inside of the normal 72-hour air tasking cycle that defines “immediate.” Immediate
AI often responds to attack requests against dynamic and time-sensitive targets.

Dynamic targeting. Dynamic targeting is the active process of identifying, prosecuting,
and effectively engaging emerging targets. The primary focus of dynamic targeting
should be the prosecution of JFC designated and prioritized time-sensitive targets (TST)
and functional component-critical targets. The destruction of these priority targets is
considered critical for achieving JFC objectives and thus requires the establishment of
detailed decision and authorization guidance for each designated target type to ensure
rapid and effective engagement. It is important to limit the total number of TST class
designations to only those meeting the definition of JP 1-02 and to provide to all levels
of C2 and force application clear guidance on what constitutes a TST/component-critical
target to avoid diversion of assets from the JFC’s overall plan.




                                             27
Time-sensitive targets. The CFACC may recommend TSTs to the JFC. TSTs are
those targets of such high priority that the JFC designates them as requiring immediate
response because they pose (or will soon pose) a clear and present danger to friendly
forces or are highly lucrative, fleeting targets of opportunity (JP 1-02). TSTs are
prosecuted using the dynamic targeting process above, but are of higher priority and
may require additional coordination with other components and/or the joint task force.
The destruction of these high payoff targets is considered critical for achieving JFC
objectives. The JFC is ultimately responsible for TST prosecution and relies on the
component commanders for conducting TST operations.

       When using on-call or dynamically re-tasked assets, immediate AI often relies on
an offboard sensor such as JSTARS to provide initial target detection and attack
targeting information. Using real-time target information via data-link, response times
can be as short as a few minutes, depending on the distances and C2 arrangements
involved. Immediate AI requests allow airborne assets to exploit enemy vulnerability
that may be of limited duration. It can work particularly well when attacking enemy
ground forces on the move in the enemy rear area and provide a responsive use of
counterland attack when supporting the ground component. The ASOC normally
coordinates and directs immediate AI requests flown short of the FSCL.

        The same quick-responsive nature of immediate AI that allows it to take
advantage of fleeting opportunities can also have a negative impact on individual
mission success. Scheduled missions allow aircrews more time to study the target
imagery and to align attack axes to optimize weapons effects. Detailed study can
reduce threat exposure and allow mission planners to optimize the weapon’s fusing for
maximum effect. Preplanning allows better packaging of strike and support assets
when required. The bottom line for dynamic targeting of airborne assets is that it should
be used in those cases when the need for a short reaction time outweighs the reduced
effectiveness that may result when compared with preplanned operations. Moreover,
opportunity costs must be considered. Commanders should ensure the benefits of
diverting air and space power away from a preplanned target outweigh the costs by
pondering several variables. Is it affordable to delay striking a preplanned target? What
are the priorities? Will diverting airpower to an unplanned target create greater effects
or is it less efficient? In short, the payoff of striking a dynamic target should be worth
the cost of diverting preplanned assets.

      To increase battlespace awareness during dynamic targeting, C2 elements must
ensure that aircrews have the most current information pertaining to the location of
SOF, friendly ground forces, and no-strike target lists.

ELEMENTS OF EFFECTIVE AI OPERATIONS
       In addition to the elements of effective counterland operations previously
discussed, there are particular considerations that are especially applicable to AI
operations. These include the elements normally required to successfully prosecute AI
operations (integration with surface maneuver and effective C2 systems) and those


                                           28
desired effects of typical interdiction operations (channeled enemy movements, high
rates of consumption, logistics constriction, and urgent movement). To what degree
each element contributes to the operation varies with the nature of the conflict,
geographic location, weather, and characteristics of the enemy.

Integration with Surface Maneuver
       An important factor in successful AI operations is integrating air maneuver with
surface maneuver. Planning and conducting AI and surface operations within a
coherent framework enhances their synergistic effect in those operations involving air,
space, and surface forces. Proper integration can create a dilemma for the enemy
commander as he reacts to the resulting combined and complementary effects of air
and surface combat power. Two complementary maneuver schemes serve as an
example. The first involves airpower fixing enemy surface forces, thus allowing ground
forces to engage. Airpower can hold enemy ground forces in place leaving friendly land
forces free to maneuver. If the enemy counters surface maneuver with movement,
losses from air attack (due to reduced concealment, greater detectability, and increased
predictability) may become unacceptable. As a result, measures required to minimize
losses from AI leave the enemy more susceptible to defeat by friendly surface forces.
The second scheme involves surface forces fixing enemy forces, thus allowing airpower
to engage the enemy. An actual or threatened surface advance can force an enemy to
respond with counter maneuvers or resupply. By placing sustained pressure on the
enemy, surface combat increases target acquisition by flushing the enemy from
concealment thereby enabling airpower to destroy enemy forces at a faster rate than
can be replaced. Close coordination among all components will help maximize enemy
vulnerability to AI.

         Mission-type orders allow for the optimum employment of air and space forces by
maximizing effects and increasing employment flexibility. For example, using broad
guidance, the JFC may direct theater-wide interdiction of all enemy second echelon
forces. The CFACC can then conduct a tailored interdiction effort against those forces
with specific targeting guidance being developed at the component or even tactical
level. In another example, the land component commander might indicate to the
CFACC that delay or disruption of a particular enemy ground force is the highest priority
for air support. The CFACC can then determine the best way to achieve those desired
effects, since he has the best means for determining how to attack the enemy with air
and space power. Surface commanders requesting supporting AI should clearly state
how it will enable or enhance their operations, listing both the desired effects and effects
to be avoided. The latter might include consequences of destroying LOCs critical to the
ground scheme of maneuver or the hazards associated with air-delivered cluster
munitions and mines. Airmen at the tactical and operational levels, especially those in
the field advising the ground component on proper use of air and space power, can
facilitate the commander’s intent process by ensuring that air support requests clearly
state the desired effects.




                                            29
Sustained and Concentrated Pressure on the Enemy
        Two key characteristics of successful counterland operations are sustained and
concentrated efforts. AI especially demands sustained, persistent action. Success or
failure often comes down to the balance between the enemy’s ability to repair the
damage versus friendly ability to inflict more damage to the system being interdicted.
Sustained pressure can be applied at the source (through strategic attack), at the
delivery end (on the battlefield), and through AI against the forces and infrastructure in
between. Therefore, persistence is a critical element in ensuring the prolonged effect of
both AI and CAS. Eventually, resourceful enemies may potentially circumvent even the
most prolonged effects of air attack. Effective employment of ISR assets provides
critical information to the CFACC on the results
of the opening attacks and on the effect
achieved over time by the air and space
operation as a whole. Such information will be
used in reattack decisions and in deciding when
to attack follow-on targets while the enemy
attempts to recover from the original attacks. AI
is often directed against replaceable systems
(vehicles, weapons, POL, communications
systems) and repairable systems such as
bridges or railroad lines. Therefore, pressure
should be sufficient to impede efforts to replace
or repair affected targets and cause stress on
the entire enemy operation. This requirement
applies particularly to operations of long
duration, because time normally allows the
enemy to restore losses. Attacks on key repair
and replacement assets may be advisable if
such targets represent the weak link in the
                                                             A thorough assessment of
enemy’s support infrastructure. Concentrating

limited numbers of AI and CAS-capable assets.

Accurate, Timely, and Relevant Intelligence
       Accurate information about the enemy’s support characteristics, force
structure, and ability to adapt is imperative to successful AI. Accurate, timely, and
relevant intelligence provides information about the enemy’s probable course(s) of
action, identifies interrelated target systems, allows the CFACC to anticipate enemy
actions, and facilitates correct assessment. A prerequisite for planning counterland
operations is an understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the enemy and how
the enemy is most likely to fight. Accurate intelligence allows commanders to develop
achievable objectives, select appropriate targets, apply the appropriate weapon and
delivery systems, and keep abreast of the enemy’s response. In order to accomplish
this, commanders require information systems that facilitate exploitation and


                                           30
dissemination of real-time and near real-time intelligence. Such intelligence is
particularly useful in dealing with targets that may have near or immediate effect on
surface forces or whose location was not accurately known. Intelligence operations
must support the joint counterland effort to enhance unity of effort. To that end, AI
targets must be identified and then prioritized in relation to their importance in achieving
campaign objectives.

         An army can be defeated by one of two main alternative means—not
  necessarily mutually exclusive: We can strike at the enemy’s troops themselves,
  either by killing them or preventing them from being in the right place at the right
  time; or we can ruin their fighting efficiency by depriving them of their supplies of
  food and war material of all kinds on which they depend for existence as a fighting
  force.

SUMMARY
        AI represents a flexible and lethal form of air and space power that can be used
in various ways to prosecute the joint battle. However employed, certain principles such
as centralized control/decentralized execution must be followed to achieve maximum
effectiveness with minimum losses. The objective of AI is to divert, disrupt, delay, or
destroy enemy land forces and their supporting capabilities. AI can channel enemy
movement, constrain logistics, disrupt communications, or force urgent movement to put
the enemy in a favorable position for friendly forces to exploit. To be most effective, AI
requires persistence, concentration, joint integration, and accurate intelligence.
Whether supporting the ground offensive by attacking ground-nominated targets or
decisively halting an enemy advance with theater-wide interdiction, AI provides a
powerful tool for defeating the enemy ground force.

DEFINITION
       CAS is air action by fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft against hostile targets which
are in close proximity to friendly forces and which require detailed integration of each air
mission with the fire and movement of those forces (JP 1-02). Employing ordnance
within close proximity of ground troops and the requirement for detailed integration are
two characteristics that distinguish CAS from other types of air warfare.
          Close proximity. Close proximity does not represent a specific distance.
          Instead, it is situational and implies a range within which some form of
          terminal attack control is required for fratricide prevention. Thus, CAS is not
          defined by a specific region of the theater/JOA. Instead, it can be conducted
          at any place and time friendly surface forces are in close proximity to enemy
          forces. For example, CAS can be employed in support of SOF operating
          anywhere in the JOA, as long as there are friendly troops within close
          proximity to the enemy forces being attacked.

          Detailed integration. The requirement for detailed integration because of
          fires, proximity, or movement is the determining factor for CAS. Detailed
          integration describes a level of coordination required to achieve desired
          effects while minimizing the risk of fratricide—from either surface fires or air-
          delivered weapons. Because of this level of integration, each element must
          be controlled in real time to prevent fratricide of ground or air forces.
          Procedures should be flexible enough so that CAS, surface fires, and the
          ground scheme of maneuver are not overly restricted. The range at which the
          preponderance of effects against the enemy shifts from surface fires to
          airpower should define the maximum range requiring detailed integration—
          this depth is a good point for planners to consider delineating between CAS
          and AI.

RESPONSIBILITIES
       The JFC establishes the guidance and priorities for CAS in the concept of
operations (CONOPS), operation or campaign plans, and air apportionment decision,
and by making capabilities and forces available to the components.




                                            32
       The CFACC is given the authority necessary to accomplish missions and tasks
assigned by the establishing commander. For CAS, these responsibilities normally
include recommending air apportionment, allocating forces/capabilities made available
from the JFC and components, creating and executing the ATO, and other applicable
actions associated with CAS execution. The CFACC maintains close coordination with
the other component commanders to ensure CAS requirements are being met in
accordance with JFC guidance.

CAS OBJECTIVES
        CAS provides firepower in offensive and defensive operations, day or night, to
destroy, suppress, neutralize, disrupt, fix, or delay enemy forces in close proximity to
friendly ground forces. For CAS to be employed effectively, it should be prioritized
against targets that present the greatest threat to the supported friendly surface force.
Moreover, CAS assets should arrive in a timely manner. CAS that arrives late may be
ineffective due to the fluid nature of ground battle.

         Almost any enemy threat in close proximity to friendly forces on the modern
battlefield is suitable for CAS targeting. However, indiscriminate CAS application
against inappropriate targets decreases mission effectiveness, increases the risk of
fratricide, and may dilute availability of CAS aircraft to an unacceptable level. Although
there is no single category of targets most suitable for CAS application, mobile targets
and their supporting firepower (in general) present the most immediate threat to friendly
surface forces and thus are prime candidates for consideration. This is especially true
when supporting light forces, such as airborne or amphibious units, since they are not
able to bring as much organic heavy firepower into battle as heavier mechanized or
armored units. CAS provides the surface commander with highly mobile, responsive,
and concentrated firepower. It enhances the element of surprise, is capable of
employing munitions with great precision, and is able to attack targets that are
inaccessible or invulnerable to available surface fire.

        The success of both offensive and defensive CAS operations in
contiguous, linear warfare may depend on massing effects at decisive points—
not diluting them across the entire battlefield. During large-scale ground operations,
there are often more requests for CAS than can be attacked by the available air assets.
As a result, CAS should be focused in those critical areas where friendly surface forces
lack the organic firepower to handle the situation themselves. The centralized C2 of
CAS employment is essential to allow the massing of its effects where needed most.
This may often be beyond the troops-in-contact (TIC) range, as CAS missions operating
there will have reduced risk of fratricide, and enemy forces destroyed or delayed there
are often kept from engaging friendly surface forces. Surface commanders should
properly prioritize and focus the firepower of apportioned and allocated CAS at decisive
places and times to achieve their objectives. Distributing CAS among many competing
requests dilutes the effects of those assets and may result in less, rather than more
effective air support to ground forces.



                                           33
CAS EFFECTS
        When it is necessary to provide troops in contact with supporting fires, CAS can
devastate enemy forces while spearheading offensive operations or covering retrograde
operations. CAS can also be used for the purposes of harassment, suppression, and
neutralization. However, because those effects are typically assigned to surface fire
support assets, such use may represent a less efficient use of limited CAS missions.
On one hand, ground commanders should use their organic firepower when better
suited for the task before calling in requests for CAS. On the other hand, a ground
commander’s organic firepower—particularly longer range systems—may not always be
the most appropriate fire support asset. Thus, when planned and integrated well, CAS
provides desired effects that can be exploited by the maneuver commander. Ultimately,
each of the different CAS applications must be weighed against other, potentially more
effective, uses for CAS-capable assets such as AI or even strategic attack. CAS is
applicable throughout the range of military operations and typically generates the
following benefits:

Facilitate Ground Action
       CAS enhances opportunities for ground commanders to seize the initiative
through offensive action. CAS can facilitate the offensive by providing the capability to
deliver a wide range of weapons, massed or distributed as necessary, and by creating
opportunities to break through enemy lines, protecting the flanks of a penetration, or
preventing the counter-maneuver of enemy surface forces. Defensive requirements to
blunt an enemy offensive may also dictate the need for close support. CAS can protect
the maneuver and retrograde movement of surface forces, protect rear area
movements, or create avenues of escape. CAS aircraft may also be used to provide
escort and suppressive supporting firepower for air mobile and airborne forces, and to
conduct surveillance and security for landing forces or patrol and probing operations.

Induce Shock, Disruption, and Disorder
       CAS should be massed to apply concentrated firepower where it is most needed
by the ground commander. When applied en masse, CAS has immediate physical and
psychological effects on enemy capabilities. Since available assets are usually limited,
CAS is applied against targets of immediate concern to surface forces when those
forces cannot produce the desired effect with organic weapons alone, when surface
forces are committed without heavy organic weapons support, or when the disposition
of targets prevents successful attack by surface firepower. When used against enemy
targets that are beyond TIC range, CAS often provides support that is more effective to
the ground force due to the decreased risk of fratricide and the reduced interference of
CAS with organic surface fires. The task of CAS is to provide selective and
discriminating firepower, when and where needed, in support of surface forces.




                                           34
AIR-GROUND INTEGRATION
        For joint air operations providing CAS, integration starts at the operational level
during the air apportionment process. Whether conducting offensive or defensive
operations, commanders plan for CAS at key points throughout the width and depth of
the battlefield where they anticipate close action with the enemy. Using JFC priorities
and commensurate with other mission requirements, the CFACC postures air assets to
optimize support to requesting units. The operation order (OPORD), ATO, airspace
control order (ACO), and special instructions (SPINS) provide the framework for
integrating joint air operation’s CAS into the commander’s CONOPS. This framework is
crucial to the effective and safe employment of CAS. In addition, component liaison
elements (such as the battlefield coordination detachment [BCD], naval and amphibious
liaison element [NALE], special operations liaison element [SOLE], Marine liaison officer
[MARLO], etc.) should ensure air-ground integration and synchronization through
effective communication and coordination.

        CAS missions are integrated with the organic fire of surface units to achieve
mutual support, increase the overall destruction of enemy forces, suppress enemy air
defenses (SEAD), and ensure air support is delivered when and where required. This
detailed integration is accomplished by parallel air and surface force control systems
that extend through all levels of command. These systems integrate air maneuver with
surface firepower to fulfill fire support requirements as they occur and deconflict air
maneuver units from surface fires. Augmentation of surface firepower by CAS can
decisively contribute to surface combat success during breakthroughs, counterattacks,
defense against enemy assaults, and surprise attacks. Moreover, CAS may also be
called upon to enhance SOF teams operating beyond the range of organic surface fires,
support SOF teams during emergency situations, or support combat search and rescue
(CSAR) situations. CAS is particularly important to offset shortages of surface firepower
during the critical landing stages of airborne, air-mobile, and amphibious operations by
friendly forces.

        Whether conducted during major operations and campaigns or lower-intensity
warfare, the need for terminal attack control, the unpredictability of the tactical situation,
the risk of fratricide, and the proliferation of lethal ground-based air defenses can make
CAS especially challenging. When friendly forces are within close proximity, more
restrictive control measures are required to integrate CAS with surface maneuver while
avoiding fratricide. The fluidity of the ground situation that exists within this close
proximity requires real-time direction from a terminal controller to ensure that targets of
highest priority to the ground commander are struck to produce immediate effects.
Thus, to ensure that CAS is available, responsive, and used to maximum effect, CAS
operations should closely integrate with the surface component commander's scheme
of maneuver. The mobility and firepower of CAS can make an immediate and direct
contribution to the surface battle when all players work together.




                                             35
TERMINAL ATTACK CONTROL
         A need for flexible, real-time targeting guidance and fratricide avoidance are
critical considerations when conducting CAS. To integrate air-ground operations safely
and effectively, either a joint terminal attack controller (JTAC) or a FAC(A) provides
terminal control for CAS missions. A JTAC is a qualified (certified) Service member
who, from a forward position, directs the action of combat aircraft engaged in CAS and
other air operations (JP 3-09.3, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for CAS). A
qualified and current JTAC will be recognized across the Department of Defense as
capable and authorized to perform terminal attack control. A FAC(A) is a specifically
trained and qualified rated officer who controls aircraft engaged in CAS while airborne.
A FAC(A) can greatly enhance the effectiveness of CAS by providing an airborne
perspective to CAS aircraft while facilitating situational awareness, deconfliction,
efficient target area flow, and accurate weapons release.

        All air- or ground-based operators, controllers, and observers within the theater
air control system (TACS)/Army air-ground system (AAGS) must understand the
capabilities and limitations of their various methods to accurately determine the
positions of enemy, neutral, and friendly positions. The decision as to what level of
accuracy, under what form of delivery, and with what weapons needs to be made at the
tactical level and can be largely predetermined and disseminated in products such as
SPINS and TTPs.

       The three types of terminal control discussed below were developed for use in
CAS but are not exclusive to this application. While most often applied in CAS with
troops in contact, all three types of control can be applied during other forms of attack
where proximity of friendlies and/or a need for some form of terminal attack guidance
exists. An example of this would be the use of small teams of special operators
scouting for lucrative targets deep in enemy-controlled territory, and providing target
description, coordinates, and other information as required.

Types of Terminal Control
        Recent technological advances in aircraft capabilities, weapons systems and
munitions have provided JTACs additional tools to maximize effects of fires while
reducing the risk of fratricide when employing airpower in close proximity to friendly
forces. GPS-equipped aircraft and munitions, laser range finders/designators, and
digital system capabilities are technologies that can be exploited in the CAS mission
area. Regardless of general guidance listed here, specific procedures for Type 1-3
terminal attack control should always be addressed in theater SPINS or rules of
engagement (ROE).

        Types 1, 2, and 3 control are the three types of terminal attack control. Each
type is characterized by a specific set of procedures outlined in JP 3-09.3. The ground
commander considers the situation and issues guidance to the JTAC based on
recommendations from his ALO on staff and associated risks identified in the tactical
risk assessment. The intent is to offer the lowest level supported commander the


                                           36
latitude to determine which type of terminal attack control best accomplishes the
mission. Risk level is not directly tied to a given type of terminal attack control. The
three types of control are not ordnance-specific and the tactical situation will define the
risk level (e.g., GPS and digital targeting systems used in Type 2 control may be a
better mitigation of risk than using non-guided free-fall munitions under Type 1 control).
It is important to understand the most important risk mitigation tool is target verification
prior to attack. Therefore, when delivering guided weapons, the point designated by the
aircraft sensor, or the coordinates entered into an inertial guided weapon may be more
practical factors for risk mitigation as opposed to attack aircraft nose position. Only a
JTAC or FAC(A) can provide type 1-3 terminal control. The following discussion
provides an operational description of types 1-3 control of CAS and matches CAS
procedures established in joint doctrine.

           Type 1. The JTAC must visually acquire the attacking aircraft and the target
          for each attack (JP 3-09.3). “Visually acquire” is literally eyes-on or via optics
          such as binoculars, without the use of third party devices such as laptops or
          other digital imagery. Analysis of attacking aircraft geometry is required to
          reduce the risk of the attack affecting friendly forces. Language barriers when
          controlling coalition aircraft, lack of confidence in a particular platform, ability
          to operate in adverse weather, or aircrew capability are all examples where
          visual means of terminal attack control may be the method of choice.

           Type 2. Type 2 control will be used when the JTAC requires control of
          individual attacks but assesses that either visual acquisition of the attacking
          aircraft or target at weapons release is not possible or when attacking aircraft
          are not in a position to acquire the mark/target prior to weapons
          release/launch (JP 3-09.3). Examples of conditions when type 2 control may
          be applicable are night, adverse weather, and high altitude or standoff
          weapons employment. An example of equipment when type 2 control is
          applicable is the use of a Predator or targeting pod sensor aimpoint via
          remotely operated video enhanced receiver. A JTAC who can see a laser
          spot on the target, or a real-time feed from a targeting pod, may be better
          able to deconflict an attack from friendly forces than one relying on visual
          contact with an attacking aircraft at high altitude. Currently fielded technology
          has the capability to improve the flow of information between the JTAC and
          pilot. These tools are an additional means to ensure the destruction of the
          enemy and prevent fratricide, and in many cases are a more reliable means
          of aimpoint verification than observing the attacker’s nose position.

          Type 3. Type 3 control is used when the JTAC requires the ability to provide
          clearance for multiple attacks within a single engagement subject to specific
          attack restrictions. Type 3 control does not require the JTAC to visually
          acquire the aircraft or the target; however, all targeting data must be
          coordinated through the supported commander’s battle staff (JP 3-09.3).
          During type 3 control, JTACs provide attacking aircraft targeting restrictions
          (e.g., time, geographic boundaries, final attack heading, specific target set,
          etc.) and then grant a “blanket” weapons release clearance to meet the


                                             37
          prescribed restrictions. The JTAC will monitor radio transmissions and other
          available digital information to maintain control of the engagement. The JTAC
          maintains abort authority. Observers may be used to provide targeting data
          and the target mark during type 3 Control. Type 3 is a CAS terminal attack
          control procedure and should not be confused with terminal guidance
          operations or AI. Missions attacking targets not in close proximity to
          friendly forces, and beyond the range requiring detailed integration with
          surface fires and maneuver, should be conducted using AI procedures
          vice CAS.

         JTAC/FAC(A)s will provide the type of control as part of the CAS brief. It is not
unusual to have two types of control in effect at one time for different flights. For
example, a JTAC/FAC(A) may control helicopters working Type 2 control from an attack
position outside the JTAC/FAC(A)’s field of view while simultaneously controlling
medium or low altitude fixed-wing attacks under Type 1 or 3 control. The JTAC/FAC(A)
maintains the flexibility to change the type of terminal attack control at any time within
guidelines established by the supported commander. Senior commanders may impose
restrictions that will prevent subordinate commanders from using certain types of
terminal attack control. However, the intent is for senior commanders to provide
guidance that allows the lowest level supported commander to make the decision based
on the situation. The JTAC/FAC(A) maintains abort authority in all cases.

Armed Unmanned Aircraft (UA) Considerations
        Clearance of fires and CAS final control for armed UA need to be clearly
established before combat operations begin. The following guidelines are based on
combat operations in Southwest Asia that were applied successfully with the Predator
UA. Armed UA procedures should follow the same procedures as other CAS airframes
in most cases, but there are situations that require additional consideration. The air
support request (ASR) process typically begins when a ground commander requests
CAS from the ASOC through the Air Force air request net (AFARN), also referred to as
the joint air request net (JARN) (see figure 4.1). The ASR process often works in
reverse when an ISR-tasked UA (e.g., Predator) locates hostile forces in an area that
requires detailed integration with or is in close proximity to ground forces. In this case,
the UA operator usually informs the ground commander (through the ASOC or the direct
air support center [DASC]) that a recently discovered target may require CAS as
opposed to the ground commander making the request. There are two basic cases that
an armed UA could require clearance of fires and final control. These cases all assume
that targets identified by a UA meet ROE requirements.

          Case 1. UA on an ASR tasking in communication with a JTAC who is in
          communication with the ground force commander.

       In this case, follow standard CAS procedures. The local ground commander
clears and gives approval for fires in the target area, and the JTAC provides final
control.



                                            38
          Case 2. UA on an ISR tasking that is not in communication with ground
          forces.

        In this case, the UA operator should receive approval to terminate the ISR
tasking temporarily. CAOC UAS responsibilities should transition from the senior
intelligence duty officer to the senior offensive duty officer. Overall C2 should transition
from the CAOC to the ASOC or DASC. The UA operator should contact the ASOC or
DASC to ensure the appropriate ground commander is contacted through appropriate
command channels. If the local ground commander has an available JTAC, the ASOC
or DASC should provide a C2 and datalink frequency for the UA operator to facilitate
clearance of fires.

        Terminal attack control and clearance of fires is important to the effective
employment of armed UA during CAS. There is an increased chance of fratricide, mid-
air collision, and confusion if procedures are not clearly defined. These risks are further
increased with the increase of armed UA. It must be made clear that the procedures
listed above are specific to past operations in Southwest Asia. Because every conflict is
different, these procedures may not apply exactly to another combat situation. The
bottom line: commanders should ensure the SPINS include clear and precise
procedures for armed UA.

Verification
       Because there is no requirement for the JTAC to visually acquire the target or
attack aircraft in Type 2 or 3 control, JTACs may be required to coordinate CAS attacks
using targeting information from an observer or other asset with real time targeting
information. The JTAC maintains control of the attacks, making clearance or abort calls
based on the information provided by additional observers or targeting sensors. The
JTAC must consider the timeliness and accuracy of targeting information when relying
on any form of remote targeting.

        One of the fundamental requirements of types 1 and 2 CAS control, especially in
a TIC situation, is the ability of the JTAC or the FAC(A) to verify the attacking aircraft’s
aimpoint prior to clearing weapons release. This is typically accomplished either by
visual observation of the attacking aircraft, a laser spot, direct data link, or other
verification of the shooter’s sensor aimpoint when employing PGMs.

       While recent technological advances in weaponry and digital/data link systems
have provided significant enhancements to the CAS mission, it is imperative that
commanders and operators fully understand the capabilities and limitations of the
systems brought to the fight. Descriptive dialog between the JTAC and aircraft will often
provide the best means of mitigating risk and producing the desired effect on target. It
is essential that all CAS participants use standard procedures and terminology (see JP
3-09.3 and AFTTP [I] 3-2.6, Multi-Service Procedures for the Joint Application of
Firepower [JFIRE]).




                                            39
CAS Execution with Non-JTAC Personnel

        Units that have a reasonable expectation to conduct terminal attack control need
to have certified JTACs available. In rare circumstances, the ground commander might
require CAS when no JTAC is available. This is considered a non-standard procedure
and should be treated as an emergency. In these instances, qualified JTACs, FAC(A)s,
and/or CAS aircrew should assist these personnel/units to the greatest extent possible
in order to bring fires to bear. Due to the complexity of CAS, the ground commander
must consider the increased risk of fratricide when using personnel who are not
qualified JTACs and accept full responsibility for the results of the attacks. The
requester must notify/alert their command element when a JTAC or FAC(A) is
unavailable. If the ground commander accepts the risk, he forwards the request to the
CAS controlling agency. This information will alert the CAS controlling agency
(ASOC/DASC or CAOC) that aircrew will be working with non-JTAC qualified personnel.
See Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (Inter-Service) (AFTTP [I]) 3-2.6,
JFIRE, for a detailed discussion.

FRATRICIDE AVOIDANCE

        The Air Force defines fratricide as the employment of weapons by friendly forces
that results in the unintentional death, injury, or damage to US, allied, or coalition
personnel, equipment, or facilities. Air operations in close proximity to friendly forces
require particular emphasis on the avoidance of fratricide. CAS requires detailed
planning, coordination, and training for effective and safe execution. Though
occasionally the result of malfunctioning weapons, fratricide has often been the result of
confusion on and over the battlefield. Causes include misidentification of targets, target
location errors, target or friendly locations incorrectly transmitted or received, and loss
of situational awareness by terminal controllers, CAS aircrews, or air support request
agencies. Items such as detailed mission planning, standardized procedures for
friendly force tracking and supporting immediate air requests, realistic training/mission
rehearsal, use of friendly tagging or tracking devices, and effective staff, FAC/air officer
and ALO coordination, and sound clearance of fires procedures can significantly reduce
the likelihood of fratricide.

        All participants in the CAS employment process are responsible for the effective
and safe planning and execution of CAS. Each participant must make every effort
possible to identify friendly units and enemy forces correctly prior to targeting, clearing
fires, and weapons release. Combat identification (CID) is the process of attaining an
accurate characterization of detected objects to the extent that high confidence and
timely application of military options and weapon resources can occur. Performed in
accordance with ROE, CID characterizations enable engagement decisions and the
subsequent use, or prohibition of use, of lethal and nonlethal weaponry to accomplish
military objectives (see JP 3-09.3 for further discussion). It is critical for all involved in
the CAS process to realize that their actions can either prevent or contribute to
unintentional or inadvertent friendly fire incidents.



                                             40
         Risk assessment is a critical factor in preventing fratricide. As the battlefield
situation changes, commanders and staffs should make continuous tactical risk
assessments. Risk assessments involve the processing of available information to
ascertain a level of acceptable risk to friendly forces or noncombatants. Based on the
current risk assessment, the supported commander will weigh the benefits and liabilities
of authorizing specific weapons types or a particular type of terminal attack control.
Considerations during risk assessment should include, but not be limited to, the
following: capabilities of units involved, information flow, uncertainty, communications
reliability, battle tracking, targeting information, weather, and ordnance effects.

       Proximity of friendly troops is also a key factor during risk assessment. JTACs
and aircrews must use additional caution when conducting CAS when friendly troops
are within one kilometer (km) of enemy targets. The JTAC should regard friendly forces
within one km as a “troops in contact” situation and thus advise the supported
commander. However, friendly forces outside one km may still be subject to weapons
effects. Although a TIC situation does not necessarily dictate a specific type of control,
CAS participants must carefully weigh the types of terminal attack control, aircraft
delivery parameter restrictions, and the choice of munitions against the risk of fratricide.

         Risk-estimate distances allow commanders to estimate the danger to friendly
troops from a CAS attack. The distances are defined by the probability of incapacitation
(PI) to ground troops. Weapon size and distance of impact to ground troops affect PI.
Moreover, different surroundings such as target elevation, terrain, buildings, trees, etc.,
can significantly reduce or increase PI. When there is a .1% (1/1000) chance of
incapacitation, the distance is considered “danger close.” The supported commander
must accept responsibility for the risk to friendly forces when targets are inside danger
close range. Risk acceptance is confirmed when the supported commander passes his
initials to the attacking CAS aircraft through the JTAC, signifying that he accepts the risk
inherent in danger close deliveries. When ordnance is a factor in the safety of friendly
troops, the aircraft’s axis of attack should normally be parallel to the friendly force’s axis
or orientation. This will preclude long and/or short deliveries from being a factor to
friendly forces. See JP 3-09.3 and AFTTP(I) 3-2.6 for a detailed discussion of risk-
estimate distance.

       Fratricide avoidance is crucial to the effective employment of CAS.
Commanders, components, and units should conduct joint training and rehearsals on a
regular basis that routinely exercise CAS scenarios to develop the skill sets and
familiarity required for success.

TYPES OF CAS REQUESTS

        There are various methods of requesting CAS, depending on how fluid the
situation is and how much premission intelligence on the target is available. Unlike
other forms of air attack, with CAS it is very rare to know the precise target prior to
takeoff. It is important to note the difference between CAS missions and CAS requests.
The conditions driving a CAS request may change right up to the time the CAS flight


                                             41
lead checks in with the joint terminal attack controller due to the fluid nature of the
battlefield, while such changes may or may not affect the actual execution timing of
CAS missions. The ground component may have a pre-identified list of CAS targets,
but the battlefield situation often delays the decision as to which target’s destruction or
disruption is the highest priority.

Preplanned Requests for CAS
       Preplanned requests for CAS mean the aircraft flying the missions are scheduled
for a particular time or time period, which normally coincides with the anticipated time
when CAS will be needed most by the ground component. Preplanned requests for
CAS will result in one of two types of mission: scheduled or on-call.

          Scheduled CAS (listed as CAS on the ATO) is the preferred method of
          employment because it puts the CAS assets over the area of the battlefield
          where they are needed most, at a specific time on target, and where a need
          for CAS has been established in advance. Scheduled missions will normally
          have a specific contact point, at a specific time, to expect handoff to a ground-
          or air-based FAC. Scheduled CAS missions are the most likely to have good
          intelligence on the expected type of target, resulting in a better munitions-
          target match. Although joint doctrine states that a specific target must be
          identified when requesting scheduled CAS, the reality of fluid battlefield
          environments makes identifying a CAS target days in advance very difficult.

          On-call CAS involves putting the aircraft on ground-based or airborne alert
          (often listed as GCAS or XCAS in the TIC) during a preplanned time period
          when the need for CAS is likely, but not guaranteed. This is a less efficient
          use of CAS resources, as the assets involved may or may not actually employ
          against the enemy unless a backup target is provided or there is a plan to
          move excess CAS sorties to AI within the ground commander’s AO.
          Therefore, commanders or planners should consider tasking XCAS flights
          with a back-up mission in case they do not use their ordnance for CAS.

        Push CAS is a form of preplanned XCAS that provides massed on-call CAS
when needed. When a significant number of CAS assets are available and the tactical
situation dictates, a continuous flow system providing a constant stream of CAS
missions to the contact points may be employed. Push CAS represents a proactive
method of distributing CAS that differs from a request-driven or “pull” method. While
similar in concept to other preplanned CAS missions, push CAS differs because it is
planned and often flown before the actual request for CAS is made by the supported
ground component. Push CAS missions are scheduled to arrive at a specified contact
point at a specified time, normally in a continuous flow, to provide constant CAS assets
available to support the ground unit(s) identified as the main weight of effort. The term
push refers to the fact that CAS missions are “pushed” forward to the ASOC, DASC,
FAC(A), or JTAC before the formal CAS request is made; those assets not needed for
CAS should be pushed to preplanned backup targets so the sorties are not wasted.
Push CAS works best in an environment where many CAS targets are available, so the


                                            42
assets involved will likely have a lucrative target to attack. Although push CAS
significantly cuts response times, the number of sorties required is often high and the
advantages gained must be weighed against the other potential uses for these assets
(such as interdicting known targets). Therefore, planners should regularly assess how
much push CAS to use based on such factors as available assets, existing targets, and
the ground scheme of maneuver.


                            THE ORIGINS OF “PUSH CAS”
                                          The successful DESERT STORM tactic of
                                          “push CAS” can trace its origins at least
                                          back to World War II. By 1944, the USAAF
                                          and RAF in Italy had perfected a method of
                                          flowing fighters into the CAS area on a
                                          regular, prescheduled basis. This system,
                                          known as “Cabrank” for its similarity to a line
                                          of taxicabs waiting for passengers, provided
                                          a constant flow of fighters overhead the
                                          ground controllers, then known as “Rovers.”
                                          If not needed for close air support, these
                                          missions pressed on to a preplanned
                                          backup target, typically a bridge
  or other interdiction target of known value to the enemy. The Cabrank system
  was possible because of Allied air superiority and large numbers of counterland
  assets, and provided the ground force with very responsive air support. Cabrank
  response time was as little as a few minutes, while traditional CAS missions that
  were only scheduled in response to specific requests by the ground force might
  not arrive for several hours. At left, P-47 Thunderbolts en route to a counterland
  target.


Immediate Requests for CAS
        Immediate requests for CAS usually result from unanticipated or unplanned
needs on the battlefield, often of an emergency nature, that require diverting or
rescheduling aircraft from other missions. Immediate requests may also result from less
emergent circumstances, where there simply wasn’t sufficient time to plan the mission
in time for the ATO cycle. While this demonstrates that not all immediate requests result
in hasty mission planning, immediate requests tend to result in missions that are likely
to be less well planned or executed due to their nature and will have an increased risk
of fratricide. Immediate requests can be filled with ground or airborne alert CAS, if
available, or by diverting aircraft from preplanned CAS (or even AI) missions that are of
lower priority. The need for immediate CAS can be reduced by apportioning the proper
amount of air and space power to support the ground scheme of maneuver, based on
the overall theater priorities. The number or duration of troops in contact may be
reduced or avoided altogether with the appropriate level of assets apportioned to AI.



                                            43
When immediate requests result in CAS requirements that exceed the CAS
apportionment, the CFACC may be unable to fill lower priority requests due to higher
priority missions or request additional CAS apportionment from the JFC. The decision
on whether or not to increase CAS apportionment will be based primarily on the gravity
of the ground situation and the contribution to theater strategy being made by the
available CAS-capable assets committed elsewhere.

        There are several factors to consider before diverting counterland aircraft for
immediate CAS requests. First, the aircrew must be CAS qualified for all but
emergency situations. To ensure target destruction and fratricide avoidance, CAS
requires extensive knowledge and familiarity with specialized CAS procedures. Second,
the aircrew should have suitable mission materials such as required maps, code words,
and communications gear. Finally, CAS aircraft should have appropriate ordnance—
fusing and weapons effects are critical factors when attacking targets in close proximity
to friendly forces, and especially so in urban environments or where avoiding collateral
damage is at a premium.

CONDITIONS FOR EFFECTIVE CAS
       CAS is one of the most complex missions performed by the Air Force. The very
complexity can limit the overall efficiency of CAS, but it is the only way to get air support
against enemy targets in close proximity to friendly positions. Effective CAS requires
proper training, equipment, and an understanding of the strengths and limitations of air
and space power. In addition to the elements that facilitate effective counterland
discussed in Chapter 1 (air superiority, joint complementary operations, appropriate
munitions, and favorable environment), the following factors are crucial to the effective
conduct of CAS:

Training and Proficiency
      CAS training should integrate all maneuver and fire support elements involved in
executing CAS. Maintaining proficiency allows aircrews, sister Service personnel, and
JTACs to adapt to rapidly changing battlefield conditions.

        Aircrew and terminal controller skill is vital to the success of CAS. Commanders
should emphasize joint training that routinely exercises CAS tactics, techniques, and
procedures to maintain aircrew and controller proficiency. Combat experience has
shown that when CAS is not practiced and proficiency is not maintained, a long time is
spent at the opening of the next conflict relearning CAS procedure—to the detriment of
friendly forces.

Planning and Integration
       Effective CAS relies on thorough, coherent planning and detailed integration of
air support and ground operations. The ability to mass CAS at a decisive point and to
provide the supporting fires needed to achieve the commander’s objectives is made
possible through detailed integration with ground forces. The preferred use of a CAS


                                             44
asset is to have it pre-planned and pre-briefed. Training and rehearsals provide
participants an opportunity to practice operations/procedures, gain familiarity with the
terrain, identify airspace restrictions, and discover any shortfalls. Participants should
include aircrews, ground forces, liason elements, and C2 agencies such as the
ASOC/DASC.

        Familiarity with the local battlefield situation is also critical to the success of CAS.
When extended periods of CAS are expected, combat effectiveness is increased when
the same units remain tasked to provide CAS over the same portions of the battlefield.
This allows the pilots and intelligence personnel to become very familiar with the local
terrain and enemy operations, as well as develop closer ties with the specific ground
units being supported. This liaison should be strengthened through close contact
between air and surface units whenever possible, a job that can be greatly facilitated by
the Army ground liaison officers (GLOs) attached to flying units as well as ALOs and
battlefield Airmen operating alongside surface forces.

Integrated C2 Infrastructure
       CAS requires an integrated, flexible C2 structure to identify requirements,
request support, prioritize competing requirements, task units, move CAS forces to the
target area, provide threat warning updates, enhance CID procedures, etc. Accordingly,
C2 requires dependable and interoperable communications among aircrews, air control
agencies, JTACs, ground forces, requesting commanders, and fire support agencies.
Any airspace control measures and fire support coordinating measures should allow for
timely employment of CAS without adversely affecting other fire support assets.

       Flexible and responsive C2 permits requests for CAS, coordinated with the
appropriate agencies, to be originated at any level of command within the supported
surface force or by elements of the TACS, such as ALOs and JTACs. During stability
operations, additional restrictions may be imposed (such as increased focus on
collateral damage estimates [CDE] or more restrictive ROE)—therefore, expect a
possible decrease in flexibility. The interval of time between a unit's request for air
support and the delivery of the supporting attack is a critical factor in CAS effectiveness.
Prompt response times allow a commander to exploit fleeting battlefield opportunities
and to survive in a defensive situation. The CFACC may grant launch and divert
authority of scheduled CAS assets to the ASOC to facilitate reduced response time.
Diverted airborne aircraft from lower priority missions may also be used. However, a
balance is required between the most effective use of resources and their response
times. Effective C2 also enhances the ability to integrate CAS with surface operations,
coordinate support, and update or warn of threats to CAS assets. The depth at which
the ASOC will control operations depends a great deal on the ability to both
communicate with forces and maintain situation awareness on targets, threats, and
other factors. The authority to redirect aircraft to or from missions beyond the FSCL
should remain centralized at the CAOC, while the authority to flow CAS assets to and
from shallow AI targets short of the FSCL is often delegated to the ASOC or tactical air
control party (TACP). An ASOC is normally tasked to support an Army unit but can also
support units from other organizations (e.g., special operations, coalition forces). It may


                                              45
also augment other missions requiring airspace control (e.g., humanitarian efforts). The
placement of the ASOC with Army or special operations echelons under conditions of
non-traditional support requires a particular focus on joint capabilities to control the
airspace, integrate fire support assets, provide high-fidelity ISR, communicate critical
weather forecasts and reports, and provide airlift support to ground maneuver forces.

       Since CAS operates in close proximity to friendly surface units, reliable
communications are mandatory. JTACs normally provide targeting instructions, final
attack clearance, and fratricide avoidance instructions to CAS aircraft. FAC(A)s can
also provide this capability and will normally be in contact with JTACs to determine
targeting, ground scheme of maneuver, coordination measures, and details on the
location of friendly forces. Since CAS requires the highest level of integration between
air and ground maneuver, specific communications procedures and training are
required for air and ground terminal attack controllers and CAS aircrews. This process
can be expedited if the ASOC provides an AO update prior to pushing the aircrew to the
FAC(A)/JTAC. Standard procedures and terminology are published in JP 3-09.3 and
AFTTP (I) 3-2.6, and may be modified by theater and local standards.

       CAS requires interoperable communications between air and surface forces.
Mismatched equipment slows coordination of fire support, and lack of secure or
frequency-agile radios may lead to compromised, garbled, or noncommunicated
mission data. Such simple errors as having the air and ground components deploy with
different codes/frequencies for their communications equipment can delay the proper
execution of CAS. As with the other aspects of CAS, the only way to ensure
interoperable communications in war is to conduct fully integrated exercises during
peacetime.

Target Marking
      CAS effectiveness is greatly improved with timely and accurate target marks.
Target marking builds situational awareness, identifies specific targets in an array,
reduces the possibility of fratricide, and facilitates terminal attack control. When
commanders or planners foresee a shortfall in ability to mark for CAS, they should
request that capability during the planning phase. Marking can identify both friendly and
enemy positions in addition to being overt or covert.

         Target marking can be accomplished through various means, including smoke
rockets or rounds, laser designation, and flares. Timely and accurate marking can
greatly increase the accuracy of CAS attacks and will also reduce the chances of
fratricide. With the use of low light and infrared systems becoming more widespread,
the use of marking devices in those spectra can be more effective than visible target
marking, depending on how the aircrew actually acquires the target and employs
ordnance on it. When marking targets, JTACs must be aware that there is a potential
risk of highlighting their position to the enemy.




                                           46
Streamlined and Flexible Procedures

       CAS must be responsive to be effective. Responsive CAS allows air and space
power to exploit fleeting battlefield opportunities. Because the modern battlefield can be
extremely dynamic, the CAS C2 system must also be flexible enough to rapidly change
targets, tactics, or weapons. The requestor is usually in the best position to determine
fire support requirements. Techniques for improving responsiveness include:

          Effective planning and rehearsal between air and ground units.

          Using forward operating bases (FOBs) or forward operating locations near the
          area of operations.

          Placing aircrews in a designated ground or airborne alert status.

          Delegating launch and divert authority to subordinate units.

          Positioning JTACs and ALOs to facilitate continuous coordination with ground
          units, communication with aircraft, and observation of enemy locations.

       Flexible and responsive procedures are critical for effective employment of CAS.
The tactical employment of CAS is centrally controlled by the ASOC and decentrally
executed at the tactical level. Launch and divert authority of scheduled CAS assets at
the ASOC or airborne controlling agency provides reduced response time. Aircraft
diverted from lower priority missions may also be used, however, a balance is required
between rapid response and efficient use of limited assets. Effective C2 also enhances
the ability to integrate CAS with surface operations, coordinate support, and update or
warn of threats to CAS assets.

       Requests for CAS, coordinated with the appropriate agencies, may be originated
at any level of command within the supported surface force. Regardless of the intensity
of the conflict, the ASOC will operate the AFARN/JARN to receive air support requests
from the TACPs supporting the ground commanders. The air request net permits the
TACP at each level of command to review the CAS requests as it goes up to the ASOC
(see Figure 4.1 in Chapter 4). This stepping-stone approach allows intermediate
ground commanders to filter low priority requests (or requesting units) or use other fires
(e.g., MLRS; artillery, etc.) to attack the target, ensuring that only the highest priority
CAS requests are reviewed at the ASOC. Because CAS sorties are a high-value,
limited asset, ground commanders at each level must prioritize where and when to
employ CAS to maximize its effectiveness on the battlefield. This prevents the ASOC
from being overwhelmed with unnecessary or low priority requests. The ASOC may
develop abbreviated message/request formats to speed the flow of information between
C2 nodes. If conducting detached, distributed, or autonomous operations, SOF may
have to set up unique procedures with the ASOC or CAOC to facilitate requests for air
support.




                                            47
SUMMARY
        CAS is an extremely demanding mission conducted in close proximity to ground
forces and requires detailed integration with the fires and maneuver of those forces.
Using JFC guidance and priorities, the CFACC recommends CAS apportionment. CAS
supports friendly surface forces in offensive or defensive operations, anywhere,
anytime, and across the range of military operations. CAS requests can be either
preplanned or immediate. CAS requires type 1, 2, or 3 control to identify targets, deliver
accurate ordnance, and prevent fratricide.        CAS requires specialized training,
proficiency, integration, C2, target marking, and flexible procedures to increase its
responsiveness.




  Successful CAS requires precise teamwork between air and ground elements.

                                 CHAPTER FOUR

     COMMAND AND CONTROL OF COUNTERLAND OPERATIONS


         I will tell you that a commander without the proper C2 assets commands
  nothing except a desk. You must have the ability to communicate with the forces
  under your command. You must have the ability to exchange information with
  them freely, frequently, and on a global basis.

                               — General Ronald R. Fogleman, CSAF, 1994-1997


       Counterland operations using advanced sensors, weapons, and information
technology give Airmen an unmatched capability to achieve desired effects against an
enemy in today’s modern combat environment. Although counterland operations
continue to become more lethal, these technological advantages may be ineffectual
unless commanders and their staffs understand the complex C2 mechanisms
associated with these operations. This chapter discusses the unique command, control,
and coordinating elements inherent to counterland operations and describes
battlespace geometry and fire support coordinating measures (FSCMs).

COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS

       The CFACC's authority, guidance, and responsibilities are assigned by the JFC
and include, but are not limited to, recommending apportionment to the JFC as well as
planning, coordinating, allocating, and tasking air and space power based on the JFC's
apportionment guidance. Since there will rarely be enough counterland-capable assets
to meet all demands, a single air commander can best ensure the unity of effort
required for optimal use of those assets; designating a CFACC adheres to the principle
of unity of command. See AFDD 2, Operations and Organization, for a more complete
discussion of the CFACC’s responsibilities.

       The CFACC is normally the supported commander for the JFC’s overall AI effort.
When designated as the supported commander, the CFACC will conduct theater-wide
or JOA-wide AI in direct support of the JFC’s overall theater objectives. The JFC sets
overall theater priorities, which guide air component objectives and determine the level
of support that air and ground maneuver will provide each other. Based on the JFC’s
guidance, the CFACC will normally establish the specific priorities for theater-wide AI
and will apply these priorities to AI targets located both outside and inside any surface
AOs. Surface commanders can determine specific AI targets or, more preferably,
provide requested effects to the air component that allow more leeway in tactical
mission planning and a more efficient use of the apportioned airpower. This way the
CFACC can best determine how to support surface commanders who, in turn, will
receive more effective air support.



                                           49
         The intent of centrally prioritizing air and space power is to provide the
effectiveness against all relevant targets, consistent with the theater commander’s
strategy. When the number of productive targets exceeds air and space power’s ability
to attack them, centralized prioritization ensures that lower-priority targets are not hit
first, regardless of whether they were nominated by an air or surface component. It is
important to remember that all components support the JFC’s overall strategy—there
should not be great disparities between the various components’ priorities for air and
space power as long as the overall objective remains in view.

       Throughout the entire process, CAS operations remain under the control of
the joint air component while supporting the joint land component. The JFC
apportions CAS and AI based on his overall strategy and CFACC recommendation.
The supported commander distributes CAS sorties to the various functions, areas, and
missions to support the JFC’s apportionment decision. The CFACC assigns CAS and
AI missions to units via the ATO. Ground force commanders request CAS in advance
of operations as part of their overall concept of operations and may distribute the CAS
to those ground forces expected to require air support the most. While the ground
component commander is normally the supported commander for CAS, direct control of
CAS missions rests with the Air Force’s ASOC, tactical air coordinator (airborne)
(TAC[A]), FAC(A), and JTACS.

       The surface commander distributes sorties allocated to CAS where his scheme
of maneuver most requires them. The air-to-ground portion of the TACS is responsible
for providing an air component liaison to the various echelons of ground command and
terminal targeting and control who helps ensure aerial maneuver is integrated with the
ground scheme of maneuver. The air liaison function should also guide the ground
commander in the optimum distribution of CAS among his various units, keeping in
mind that air and space power is most effective when concentrated at the decisive
points. These decisive points may sometimes be located deep in the battlespace where
SOF may be operating.

       To create synergy with special operations, the combination of SOF and airpower
requires cooperative support relationships. There may be occasions where the joint
force special operations component commander (JFSOCC) is the supported
commander for CAS and AI within the joint special operations area (JSOA). Normally
the joint special operations air component commander (JSOACC) will provide the
required C2 elements, such as the joint air control element (JACE), to coordinate and
control allocated conventional air power. At the request of the JFSOCC, the CFACC
provides elements and C2 nodes to SOF. This may include placing a liaison or C2
element with the JFSOCC, joint special operations task force, or other SOF elements.

       There may also be occasions where the JFSOCC is a supporting commander for
AI sorties. Whether operating under control of the CFACC or the JFSOCC, SOF and air
maneuver elements must be coordinated. Coordination is crucial because air and SOF
assets often share common areas and operate in the deep JOA. SOF aviation and land
assets are integrated closely in all joint air operations, from planning through execution.



                                            50
To ensure this, the JFSOCC provides the CFACC a SOLE to coordinate, deconflict, and
integrate SOF operations, strategy, and plans with CFACC forces.

       Command relationships below the level of the CFACC are exercised using the
TACS. Decisions, such as the degree of battle management authority delegated to
subordinate command elements, must balance between the commander’s intent,
communications connectivity, time constraints, and access to information. As with all
C2, the CFACC must clearly state what level of decision-making authority is possessed
by subordinate TACS elements to avoid confusion.

COMMAND AND CONTROL ARCHITECTURE

        Counterland operations require an integrated, flexible, and responsive C2
structure to process air and space power requirements, and a dependable,
interoperable, and secure communications architecture to exercise control. The JFC
normally exercises operational control (OPCON) through component commanders. The
CFACC staff located in the CAOC will task and allocate resources for counterland
operations in support of joint operations using host component organic C2 architecture.
Reliable, secure communications are required to exchange information among all
participants. In joint operations, components provide and operate the C2 systems,
which have similar functions at each level of command. The CFACC tasks air
capabilities and forces made available for joint tasking through the CAOC and
appropriate Service component C2 systems to ensure the proper integration of air and
space power with the ground scheme of maneuver. The following discussion briefly
describes each Service component’s C2 architecture for conducting counterland
operations.

Theater Air Control System (TACS)
      The TACS is the CFACC’s mechanism for tasking and controlling theater air and
space power. It consists of airborne and ground elements to conduct tailored C2 of
counterland operations. The structure of the TACS should reflect sensor coverage,
component liaison elements, and the communications required to provide adequate
support. The TACS provides the CFACC the capability to centrally plan and
control joint air operations through the CAOC while facilitating decentralized
execution through the subordinate elements of the TACS.

       As an organic Air Force weapon system, the TACS remains under command of
the commander, Air Force forces (COMAFFOR). The COMAFFOR’s focal point for
tasking and exercising OPCON over Air Force forces is the CAOC, which is the senior
element of the TACS. In multinational commands, the name and function of certain
TACS elements may differ, but multinational air components have similar capabilities.




                                          51
Army Air-Ground System (AAGS)
       Closely related to, and interconnected with, the TACS is the AAGS. The AAGS
provides for interface between Army and tactical air support agencies of other Services
in the planning, evaluating, processing, and coordinating of air support requirements
and operations (JP 1-02). Using organic staff members and communications equipment,
the AAGS works in conjunction with the TACS to coordinate and integrate both Army
component aviation support and air component support with Army ground maneuver.
Army airspace C2 (A2C2) elements are at the senior Army echelon and may extend
down through all tactical command levels to the maneuver battalion.

        Primary coordination between the TACS and the AAGS starts with the Army’s
BCD in the CAOC and the air component coordination element (ACCE) liaison at the
joint force land component commander’s (JFLCC) headquarters. The ASOC is the next
level of Air Force-Army integration. While the CAOC provides overall theater control of
air and space power, the ASOC provides primary control of airpower in support of the
Army. Integration then continues down through the air component liaisons aligned with
land combat forces and ultimately provides terminal targeting and control. Terminal
attack control of CAS assets is the final step in the TACS for CAS execution. There are
both ground and air elements of the TACS to accomplish this mission. When
integrated, the TACS and AAGS are collectively known as the TACS-AAGS (Figure
4.1).

         The Army is transforming its force structure into self-contained modular units that
facilitate expeditionary operations. Command echelons will transform to a lighter, lean
force. The Army intends to replace its current structure with an organization built
around an operational-level command headquarters, a warfighting headquarters, and
brigade combat teams (BCTs). As the Army transitions to its modular force, Air Force
C2 elements similar to the ACCE, ASOC, and TACPs will reside at appropriate Army
echelons. For further details, see Army Field Manual (FM) 3-52 and draft FM 3-91(I) /
3-92(I).

Navy Tactical Air Control System (NTACS)
       The NTACS is the principal air control system afloat. The NTACS is comprised
of the Navy tactical air control center (TACC), tactical air direction center (TADC), and
helicopter direction center. The Navy TACC is the primary air control agency within the
area of operations from which all air operations supporting the amphibious task force
are controlled.

Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS)
       The MACCS consists of various air C2 agencies designed to provide the Marine
air-ground task force (MAGTF) aviation combat element commander with the ability to
monitor, supervise, and influence the application of Marine air. Like the Air Force,
Marine aviation's philosophy is one of centralized control and decentralized execution.
The Marine force's focal point for tasking and exercising operational control over Marine
Corps air forces is the tactical air command center (TACC), which performs similar
duties for organic Marine aviation that the CAOC performs for joint air component
operations. The DASC is roughly equivalent to the Air Force’s ASOC, while at lower
echelons of command the Marine system uses the same TACP label for air support
liaisons as the TACS-AAGS.

       During the conduct of an amphibious operation, elements of both Navy and
Marine systems are used to different degrees from the beginning of the operation until
the C2 of aircraft and missiles is phased ashore. Under the commander, amphibious
task force, the Navy TACC, typically onboard the amphibious flagship, will normally be
established as the agency responsible for controlling all air operations within the
allocated airspace regardless of mission or origin, to include supporting arms. As the
amphibious operation proceeds, C2 of aviation operations is phased ashore and
command responsibilities for landing force air operations shift from the Navy to the
Marines as MACCS agencies are established on the ground. For further discussion of
air support to amphibious operations, see JP 3-09.3.

Special Operations

       Theater special operations are normally under the control of the JFSOCC. If
designated by the JFSOCC, control of SOF airpower is normally exercised by a
JSOACC. If a JSOACC has not been designated, then SOF airpower is controlled by
its Service component within the joint force special operations command. Principal
organizations and personnel that support coordination of CAS for SOF are the SOLE,



                                        54
JACE, the special operations C2 element, special tactics teams, and JTAC-qualified
SOF personnel.

Theater Air Ground System (TAGS)
       The digitalization of the modern battlefield has improved the CFACC’s ability to
command and control air and space power. The speed and non-linear aspects of
modern warfare, as well as the precision of today’s weapons, dictate close coordination
on the battlefield among the JFC’s components. The CFACC must ensure all elements
of the TACS are in place and the various liaison positions throughout the command
chain filled prior to, or as soon as possible after, the start of an operation or campaign.
When all elements of the TACS, AAGS, MACCS, and NTACS integrate, the entire
system is labeled the TAGS.

COMMAND AND CONTROL ELEMENTS

Air and Space Operations Center (AOC)
       The AOC is the operations command center of the JFACC and provides the
capability to lead, monitor, and direct the activities of assigned or attached forces. It is
the senior C2 element of the TACS and includes personnel and equipment from all the
necessary disciplines to ensure the effective conduct of air and space operations (e.g.,
communications, operations, intelligence, etc.). The AOC weapon system is known as
the “Falconer” and will normally be designated the joint air and space operations center
(JAOC) or CAOC during joint or combined operations.

        The AOC is the senior operational-level element responsible for planning,
directing, coordinating, controlling, and assessing air and space operations. Although
actual theater AOC organizational structures may vary, the five basic functions
performed by all large AOCs include: 1) strategy development; 2) combat planning; 3)
combat operations; 4) air mobility; and 5) ISR. Using these functions, the AOC is a
centralized hub for developing an air scheme of maneuver, generating a joint air
operations plan (JAOP), allocating resources, tasking forces through an ATO, managing
airspace through an airspace control order (ACO), and conducting operational
assessment. Although the Air Force provides the core manpower capability for the
AOC, other Service component commands contributing air and space forces may
provide personnel in accordance with the magnitude of their force contribution. The
AOC can perform a wide range of functions that can be tailored to a specific mission
and scaled to the associated task force presented to the JFC.

Air Support Operations Center (ASOC)
       The ASOC is the primary control agency of the TACS for execution of air and
space power in direct support of land operations—its primary mission is to control air
operations short of the FSCL. Normally collocated with the senior Army fires element,
the ASOC coordinates and directs air support for land forces at corps level and below.
The ASOC is directly subordinate to the AOC, and is responsible for the coordination



                                            55
and control of air component missions in its assigned area. Located within the
supported ground commander’s AO, the ASOC’s designated area typically extends to
the FSCL for actual control of mission execution, and may extend to the corps’ forward
boundary for planning and advisory purposes. In the latter capacity, the ASOC
commander and staff advise the corps commander on CAS employment and target
nominations for those AI and SEAD missions that support the ground force and that part
of airborne ISR and airlift that directly supports the ground component. Air missions
that fly within the ASOC’s control area but do not directly support the ground component
will normally be coordinated through the ASOC to deconflict with ground force
maneuver and fires in addition to receiving target and threat updates.

       The ASOC also provides rapid response to requests for air support and is
capable of assisting time-sensitive targeting and friendly force location information to
CAS, AI, SEAD, air mobility, and ISR missions. The AOC will normally delegate launch
or divert authority for alert CAS missions to the ASOC, providing a faster response time
when air support is needed. The decision to delegate re-targeting authority to the
ASOC for specific AI missions inside the FSCL will depend on actual circumstances,
including the timeliness required for getting desired effects on target. Unless
specifically delegated, however, targeting authority for all AI missions remains with the
AOC.

     OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM TACTICAL AIR CONTROL SYSTEM

          During the initial stages of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM, an ASOC
   was not deployed and established to handle the air war in Afghanistan. This
   hampered airpower in a number of different ways. Real-time target updates,
   target prioritization for air assets, and aircraft deconfliction in the target area
   were often accomplished solely by on-station FAC(A)s. The lack of an ASOC
   caused counterland assets to waste valuable time and fuel looking for
   correct/any information on the ground order of battle. Moreover, mission
   essentials such as frequencies to contact ground forces, preliminary 9-line
   briefings, or any target information other than a set of friendly coordinates (that
   may have been 8-24 hours old) were lacking. These shortcomings slowed
   airpower’s responsiveness. If C2 air assets had been made readily available to
   control counterland operations, they could have filled the void until a suitable
   TACS was deployed and established, thus improving the efficiency of airpower.

                                                                 —Various Sources


       The ASOC is normally sourced and formed from an Air Force air support
operations group (ASOG) and the Commander of the ASOG is normally dual-hatted as
the director of the ASOC. In this dual role, the director of the ASOC normally exercises
OPCON and administrative control as delegated from the COMAFFOR over Air Force
forces assigned or attached to the ASOC. Further, when operating within a joint
environment, the director of the ASOC normally exercises tactical control (TACON) of



                                           56
joint forces made available for tasking through an ASOC. The director of the ASOC
usually acts as the corps ALO and the CFACC’s primary representative to the senior
tactical ground commanders. Air Force ASOCs do not deploy independently, and rely
on their associated ground forces for much of their logistics support. They may be
tailored in size depending on the task and character of the conflict. ASOC members
must be strongly versed in Air Force doctrine and capabilities across the spectrum to
include counterland, counterair, SEAD, ISR, information operations, and personnel
recovery operations.

        Three principles should be considered when employing an ASOC. First, an
ASOC should not be divided other than to relocate it. The ASOC derives synergy and
efficiency from a group of highly trained Airmen working together, in concert. Splitting
an ASOC team may degrade its ability to effectively complete its mission. Second, the
ASOC needs to be located in a relatively secure location. The firepower an ASOC can
bring to the fight dwarfs nearly anything else on the battlefield. If taken out through
enemy action, friendly ground forces will lose a significant force multiplier. However,
security must be weighed against radio limitations. In order to control airpower, an
ASOC needs the ability to communicate with the aircraft. Thus, the third principle is that
the ASOC should be located where it can maintain line of sight communications with
aircraft to its maximum operating depth. While high frequency and satellite radio
enhance the range of the AFARN/JARN, many aircraft communications are restricted by
several factors.      Radio power, antenna size, etc., are factors that impact
communications ranges. Terrain is another consideration. If located in a valley, the
ASOC’s communication range will be reduced because of line-of-sight restrictions.

       An emerging concept is being developed jointly by the Air Force and the ground
Services to enhance joint collaborative efforts through complete integration, rather than
just deconfliction, of joint assets. One example might be the establishing of a joint air-
ground control cell (JAGC2). It would include a functioning Air Force ASOC and
appropriate TACP, highest echelon Army fire and effects cell, airspace control, and
other Army or special operations C2 elements. The combined actions of these various
elements would be the mission of the JAGC2.




                                           57
                  Joint Air-Ground Control Cell (JAGC2) Concept

         As all Services transform and as a result from lessons learned during
  combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq (2001-2005), the imperative to build C2
  structures has highlighted both doctrinal and technical air/ground integration
  issues. The concept would enhance the joint collaborative efforts through complete
  integration rather than just deconfliction of joint assets. It might include a
  functioning Air Force ASOC, appropriate Air Force TACP, highest echelon Army
  FSC, A2C2 and other Army or special operations C2 elements. Envisioned as an
  integrating cell, the JAGC2 would focus the efforts of the various functional cells on
  planning, and rapid coordination, deconfliction, and control of all air operations out
  to the FSCL, integrating the functions currently performed by the ASOC, TACP,
  and A2C2. The overlying authority would remain the theater airspace control
  authority (ACA), which is normally delegated to the CFACC by the JFC.
  Additionally, through fully integrated intelligence, targeting and fires, the JAGC2
  would facilitate the rapid employment of all fires while simultaneously expediting
  the attack of emerging high value TSTs within the ground commander’s AO.
          The JAGC2 concept is rapidly being developed as an integrated answer to
  joint issues such as providing C2 for rapidly expanding numbers of unmanned
  aircraft, and will better enable dynamic targeting of ground targets in the vicinity of
  friendly ground operations.
                                                                    —Various Sources



Control and Reporting Center (CRC)
       The CRC is a deployable, ground based command, control, and communications
radar element of the TACS. A CRC is subordinate to the CAOC and provides the
CFACC with real-time operational control of forces. The CRC gives the CAOC a current
air picture and status of air defense assets through voice communications, direct
computer interface, or both. It performs centralized C2 of joint operations by conducting
threat warning, battle management, weapons control, combat identification, and
strategic communications. It can facilitate decentralized execution of air defense and
airspace control functions by detecting and identifying hostile airborne objects or by
scrambling and diverting air defense aircraft. In a limited capacity, the CRC can relay
CAOC/ASOC information to and from aircraft. The CRC integrates a comprehensive air
picture via multiple data links from air-, sea-, and land-based sensors and surveillance
and control radars.

Expeditionary Operations Center (EOC)
       Similar to a wing operations center (WOC), the EOC is a deployed wing/group
commander’s C2 element that includes a command post, command section, and other
planning and support elements as required. The EOC is subordinate to the CAOC and
functions as the operations center for all units assigned or attached to an expeditionary


                                            58
wing/group. The EOC has voice and data communications (direct and secure where
required) with assigned and attached units, the CAOC, control and reporting centers,
the ASOC, and aircraft within line of sight. The EOC ensures sorties are generated to
accomplish CAS and AI missions as directed by the ATO and may recommend
weapons load changes based on factors including weapons availability and desired
effects. Once tasked with CAS missions, EOCs have the authority to liaise directly with
ASOCs and DASCs to ensure aircrews have the most recent information for their
intended target area. Using the communications link to the CAOC and ASOC, EOCs
provide a critical link for ground alert scrambles, TST, and dynamic targeting information
passage. A GLO within the EOC is essential to facilitate an effective interface between
air and ground units when conducting dynamic counterland operations.

Airborne C2
        Airborne C2 manages airborne assets operating beyond the normal
communication coverage of ground TACS elements and can act either as a self-
contained airborne command post or as a relay for ground-based command centers
such as the ASOC. With properly trained aircrew, airborne C2 performs various CAOC
and ASOC functions to expedite C2 while extending the range of radio communications
of C2 nodes. Moreover, airborne C2 platforms ensure continuity of operations in the
event that elements of the TACS are not yet deployed or have been disabled. Attack
aircraft checking in for CAS or AI targets within the land component AO often
communicate with airborne C2 as opposed to talking directly with the ASOC, due to
radio and line-of-sight limitations.

      The airborne battlefield C2 center was an airborne extension of the CAOC/ASOC
and functioned as a key link in the C2 network for counterland operations. Although this
mission is no longer associated with the EC-130E, elements of the airborne C2 center
mission have migrated between other systems such as AWACS, JSTARS, and CRCs.
One limitation of this single-platform approach is that aircraft such as AWACS and
JSTARS normally have a different primary mission than acting as an extension of the
ASOC. For example, their orbit location for proper air-to-air or air-to-ground radar
coverage may move them out of contact range with the ASOC. A dedicated UA or near-
space communications relay for the ASOC may be a better option when feasible.

                   COUNTERLAND OPERATIONS AT AL KHAFJI

        During the evening of 29 January 1991, the Iraqi Army set elements of three
divisions in motion southward out of their static positions in occupied Kuwait. While
their ultimate objectives are not known, there is no question that all three advances
were aimed at engaging coalition forces, with the largest ground battle developing in
the Saudi town of Ra’s al Khafji. As news of the initial contacts with Iraqi ground
forces flowed into the air control center at Riyadh, additional sorties by E-8 JSTARS
surveillance aircraft and fighters armed for air interdiction were ordered.

       While JSTARS located, tracked, and provided vectors to the columns of
advancing Iraqi vehicles, flights of fighters, bombers, attack aircraft, and attack
helicopters from all of the Services closed in for the kill. Close air support was flown
in and around Khafji itself in support of engaged coalition ground forces, resulting in
heavy losses to the Iraqi 5th Mechanized Division. Further north, the other two lines
of Iraqi advance suddenly found themselves very exposed, with their own movement
serving only to highlight themselves as targets. Coalition air interdiction missions
took full advantage of this, using a variety of night vision devices and precision guided
munitions to inflict even greater damage and stop the Iraqi advance. After losing
hundreds of vehicles and taking thousands of casualties, the Iraqis abandoned the
attack as a costly failure. Airpower assets like the E-8 JSTARS (below left) were key
in achieving the results depicted in photograph to the right.




        Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System. JSTARS is an airborne
        joint surveillance, targeting, and battle management C2 system designed to
        provide near real-time, wide-area surveillance and targeting information on
        moving and stationary ground targets. It is a key link in the C2 network for
        counterland operations. JSTARS is a theater-wide C2 platform that conducts
        ground surveillance to develop an understanding of the enemy situation and
        supports counterland attack operations. However, the JFC determines the
        most effective use of JSTARS based on the situation and the concept of
        operations. JSTARS is also capable of supporting air operations to include
        AI, CAS, offensive counterair, and other special missions spanning the range
        of military operations. JSTARS’ mission priorities are established by the JFC
        based on the overall campaign objectives. The system has both airborne and
        ground-based segments. It is equipped with communications and battle



                                          60
          management displays, and can host a CAOC element and/or perform some
          ASOC functions.

          Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS). AWACS is an airborne
          radar control and battle management element of the TACS. It has the ability
          to provide detection and control of aircraft below and beyond the coverage of
          ground-based radar, or when ground-based radar elements are not available.
          In a limited capacity, AWACS can perform the roles of an alternate control
          and reporting center, alternate CAOC combat operations division, and can
          relay ASOC information to and from aircraft as well as perform limited
          additional ASOC functions.

          Unmanned aircraft (UA). Besides their proven ISR, target cueing, and
          weapons capability, UA can act as a communications link when equipped with
          appropriate communications gear. This can be very useful in small-scale
          operations or stability operations when low-density, high-demand (LDHD)
          aircraft such as AWACS or JSTARS are unavailable. Without LDHD C2
          platforms in theater and confronted with line-of-sight radio limitations,
          commanders should consider dedicating some UA for C2 support to provide
          the vital link between the ASOC and inbound combat aircraft tasked for CAS.

LIAISON ELEMENTS
       Effective liaison coordination is crucial to successful counterland operations.
Liaisons within the CAOC include the NALE, the MARLO, and the SOLE. In addition to
coordinating targeting processes, these liaison functions are vital for coordinating kill
box deconfliction. In the rare instance that a non-Air Force CFACC is designated, the
COMAFFOR should assign an Air Force liaison element to the CAOC.

Battlefield Coordination Detachment (BCD)
        The commander, Army forces’ (COMARFOR’s) liaison element to the CFACC is
the BCD located in the CAOC. The BCD facilitates the direct coordination between
tactical air and Army units for scheduled CAS planning. The BCD also processes the
COMARFOR’s AI target nominations and acts throughout planning and execution to
ensure proper representation of ground component priorities in the overall process.
Moreover, the BCD should inform the Army force commander of which nominated
targets that were or were not included on the target list for incorporation into the ATO,
and the approval status of preplanned CAS requests. This feedback loop is critical, as
land commanders must know which requested targets did/did not meet the JFC’s
priority requirements for air attack. During the execution process, the BCD provides
current land picture information to the CAOC on both friendly and enemy ground forces.

Air Component Coordination Element (ACCE)
       When required, the CFACC may establish and deploy an ACCE to other
functional component commanders’ headquarters (especially the land component)
and/or to the JFC’s headquarters to better integrate air and space operations across the


                                           61
overall joint force. The ACCE director is the CFACC’s personal liaison and primary
representative to the other commanders in the operation. The ACCE director derives all
of his or her authority from the CFACC. The ACCE team facilitates interaction and
communication between the respective staffs, but should not be used for formal request
and coordination processes such as those employed by the BCD.
       The ACCE team reaches back to their respective counterparts in the CAOC to
provide the other headquarters commander information on the best way to employ air
and space power. This is a two-way relationship in that the ACCE not only provides
information and flow to the CFACC but must also help ensure CFACC information is
flowing to and understood by the JFC, JFLCC, JFMCC, and JFSOCC.
        The ACCE is task organized to best serve the CFACC’s range of operations.
Generally, the ACCE should include functional areas such as operations, plans, and
intelligence and, depending on the operation, may also include a logistics, a mobility,
and/or a space functional area. For major operations and campaigns with a 24-hour
battle rhythm, the ACCE should have sufficient personnel to work each of the duty
shifts. For smaller operations, the ACCE may have as few as one person performing
both the operations and plans functions and one person performing the intelligence
function.
       While a relatively new concept, the ACCE has proven valuable in large-scale
operations, counterinsurgency, and humanitarian operations. For more guidance on the
ACCE, see AFDD 2, Operations and Organization, and the ACCE Handbook.

Ground Liaison Officer (GLO)

       The primary function of the GLO is to provide liaison between land elements and
air elements providing air support to the JFLCC. GLOs are usually assigned to air
wings and operate out of an EOC when the wing is deployed forward. The GLO reports
to the BCD, interprets the land battle for the EOC, assists tactical planning coordination
between the flying unit and supported ground unit(s), briefs aircrew, and relays mission
results to the BCD.

Air Liaison Officer (ALO)

       An ALO is a rated officer, aligned with a land maneuver unit, who functions as
the primary advisor to individual land commanders on the capabilities and limitations of
air power. Acting as a land commander’s expert on air and space operations, ALOs
must be involved in the supported land commander’s military decision-making process
so they can perform detailed air support planning with their own staff. ALOs are
assigned to all land maneuver units at the corps, division, and brigade levels. Battalion
ALOs (BALOs) are highly experienced enlisted JTACs who normally perform this
function at the battalion level.




                                           62
Tactical Air Control Party (TACP)
        The TACP is the principal Air Force liaison element aligned with Army maneuver
units from corps through battalion. The primary mission of corps through brigade-level
TACPs is to advise their respective land commanders on the capabilities and limitations
of air and space power as well as assist the ground commander in planning, requesting,
and coordinating CAS. At the battalion level, TACPs are normally organized to request
and control aircraft. The TACP is the CFACC’s primary representative to the tactical
land commander and provides terminal attack control. In the TACS chain of command,
TACPs are under ASOC control. While they operate in the field, colocated with the
ground units they support, TACP personnel remain under the OPCON of the
COMAFFOR.

TERMINAL ATTACK CONTROL

Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC)
        The JTAC is the TACP terminal air control expert. The JTAC provides
recommendations on the integration of CAS with the ground commander’s scheme of
maneuver. JTACs are qualified to perform terminal attack control of individual CAS
missions. A JTAC should be trained to: 1) know the enemy situation, selected targets,
and location of friendly units; 2) know the supported unit’s plans, position, and needs;
3) validate targets of opportunity; 4) advise the commander on proper employment of air
assets; 5) submit immediate requests for CAS; 6) control CAS with supported
commander’s approval; and 7) perform battle damage assessment (BDA). Only
specially trained and certified individuals are authorized to perform this duty. JTACs
must receive clearance from the land maneuver commander whom they are attached to
before authorizing aircraft to expend ordnance.

Joint Fires Observer (JFO)
       A JFO is a trained and qualified Service member who can request, adjust, and
control surface-to-surface fires, provide targeting information in support of types 2 and 3
CAS terminal attack controls, and perform autonomous terminal guidance operations.
Trained JFOs, in conjunction with JTACs, assist maneuver commanders with timely
planning, synchronization, and responsive execution of joint fires and effects. The
intent of a JFO is to add joint warfighting capability, not circumvent the need for qualified
JTACs. JFOs expand the target set available to ground commanders by passing
accurate targeting information to both the JTAC and aircrew.

Special Tactics Team (STT)
      Air Force STTs are composed primarily of special operations combat control and
pararescue personnel. Combat control personnel are JTAC-qualified and support SOF
ground elements by providing air-ground interface, fire support, target designation, C2
communications, airfield survey, and terminal control operations.




                                             63
Forward Air Controller (Airborne) (FAC[A])

        The FAC(A) is an airborne extension of the TACP. Only specially trained and
certified aircrews are authorized to perform this duty, as it requires detailed knowledge
of friendly and target locations, artillery, available aircraft weapons and fuel states, the
ability to conduct all three types of terminal attack control, and the flexibility to prioritize
and adjust in a dynamic environment. FAC(A)s must receive land maneuver
commander clearance, normally through the TACP, before expending or authorizing
other aircraft to expend ordnance. The FAC(A) may provide terminal control, relay CAS
briefings, provide immediate target and threat reconnaissance, and mark targets for
attacking aircraft. Threats and weather permitting, the FAC(A) can see well beyond the
visual range of ground-based JTACs. The FAC(A) can perform tactical battle
management by cycling aircraft through the target area, while prioritizing targets in
coordination with the JTAC. In this role, the FAC(A) is operating as a TAC(A). The
FAC(A) may provide positive identification (PID), CDE, and immediate BDA.

Tactical Air Coordinator (Airborne) (TAC[A])

        A TAC(A) is “an officer who coordinates, from an aircraft, the actions of other
aircraft engaged in air support of ground or sea forces” (JP 1-02). Normally performed
by an officer on a JSTARS or as a FAC(A), the TAC(A) provides a communication relay
between the TACP and attack aircraft as well as other agencies of the TACS. It also
expedites CAS aircraft-to-FAC hand-off during heavy CAS operations. Air Force two-
ship FAC(A) flights, especially in higher threat environments, may divide responsibilities
so that one aircraft fills the normal FAC(A) role while the second becomes a TAC(A).

Special Operations Liaison Element
        The SOLE is a team provided by the JFSOCC to integrate and synchronize
special operations air, surface, and subsurface operations with conventional air
operations. The SOLE director places SOF ground, maritime, and air liaison personnel
in divisions of the CAOC providing a SOF presence that is aware of the activities of
SOF units in the field and visibility of SOF operations in the air tasking order and the
airspace control order. The SOLE coordinates appropriate fire support coordinating
measures, targeting, and airspace to integrate and synchronize fires to avoid duplication
and fratricide.

BATTLESPACE GEOMETRY AND COORDINATION
       Since counterland is normally conducted in conjunction with friendly land forces,
FSCMs must be established to integrate joint fires and avoid fratricide. During major
operations and campaigns, FSCMs are established for adjacent lanes of maneuver and
are linear in nature. Major operations may also involve rapidly advancing ground
maneuver or widely distributed ground operations; either of these approaches will
require non-linear FSCMs. Moreover, when conducting stability operations, the linear
battlespace also tends to dissolve into pockets of dispersed operations and
noncontiguous AOs. Since counterland is applicable across the entire spectrum of war,


                                              64
CAS and AI require FSCMs that are flexible, simple, effective, and relevant to conflicts
characterized by linear and nonlinear operations. Before discussing coordination
measures, a brief background on battlespace geometry will provide a better
understanding for the types of FSCMs required in linear and nonlinear operations.

Contiguous and Noncontiguous Operations
       Operational areas may be contiguous or noncontiguous. When they are
contiguous, a boundary separates them. When operational areas are noncontiguous,
they do not share a boundary; the concept of operations links the elements of the force.
A noncontiguous operational area normally is characterized by a 360-degree boundary.
The higher headquarters is responsible for the area between noncontiguous operational
areas (JP 3-0, Joint Operations).

Linear and Nonlinear Operations
        In linear operations, commanders direct and sustain combat power toward
enemy forces in concert with adjacent units. Linearity refers primarily to the conduct of
operations along lines of operations with identified forward lines of own troops (FLOT).
In linear operations, emphasis is placed on maintaining the position of the land force in
relation to other friendly forces. This positioning usually results in contiguous operations
where surface forces share boundaries. Linear operations are normally conducted


                                            65
against a deeply arrayed, echeloned enemy force or when the threat to LOCs reduces
friendly force freedom of action. In these circumstances, linear operations allow
commanders to concentrate and integrate combat power more easily. World War I,
World War II, and Korea offer multiple examples of linear operations while more recent
examples include the four-day ground maneuver during Operation DESERT STORM
and the drive to Baghdad during Operation IRAQI FREEDOM.

      Figure 4.4. Linear vs. Nonlinear Operations (Depicted as a Corps AO)

       In nonlinear operations, forces orient on objectives without geographic reference
to adjacent forces. Nonlinear operations typically focus on multiple decisive points and
are characterized by noncontiguous operations. Nonlinear operations emphasize
simultaneous operations along multiple lines of operations from selected bases.
Nonlinear operations place a premium on intelligence, aerial mobility, and sustainment.



                                                          66
Often integrated with ground maneuver, swift aerial attack delivering concentrated,
precise fire against several decisive points can induce paralysis and shock among
enemy troops and commanders.              Operations JUST CAUSE and ENDURING
FREEDOM are examples of nonlinear operations. The joint forces orient more on their
assigned objectives (for example, destroying an enemy force or seizing and controlling
critical terrain or population centers) and less on their geographic relationship to other
friendly forces. To protect themselves and achieve objectives, ground forces rely
heavily on air and space power to provide battlespace awareness, mobility advantages,
and freedom of action.

       Depending on the situation, the JFC may conduct linear or nonlinear offensive
and defensive operations in contiguous and noncontiguous areas. Linear contiguous
warfare typically characterizes major operations and campaigns while stability
operations are usually nonlinear and noncontiguous.

LINEAR COORDINATION MEASURES
         Various boundaries and coordination measures are used for airspace control and
fire support coordination when planning and executing counterland operations. The
measures help to integrate air and ground maneuver, ensure deconfliction, avoid
fratricide, and identify which parts of the battlespace require specialized control
procedures. The JFC may define lateral, rear, and forward boundaries to define AOs
for the various surface components. The following discussion centers on linear
boundaries and coordination measures that play a significant role in counterland
operations.

Forward Boundary (FB)
        The forward boundary defines a component’s outer AO and is the farthest limit of
an organization's responsibility. The organization is responsible for deep operations to
that limit. Within the JOA, the next higher headquarters is responsible for coordinating
deep operations beyond the FB. In offensive operations, the forward boundary may
move from phase line to phase line, depending on the battlefield situation.

Forward Line of Own Troops (FLOT)
        The FLOT is a line that indicates the most forward positions of friendly forces
during linear operations at a specific time. The forward line of own troops normally
identifies the forward location of covering and screening forces. The zone between the
FLOT and the FSCL is typically the area over which friendly ground forces intend to
maneuver in the near future and may also be the area within which ground force organic
fires are employed. This zone is the area where air operations are normally executed
through the ASOC.

Fire Support Coordination Measures (FSCM)
       FSCMs are necessary to facilitate the rapid engagement of targets and
simultaneously provide safeguards for friendly forces. FSCMs are divided into two
categories: permissive and restrictive. Permissive FSCMs facilitate attacks and include


                                           67
coordinated fire lines (CFL), free fire areas (FFA), and FSCL. Restrictive measures
safeguard friendly forces and include no-fire areas (NFA), restrictive fire areas (RFA),
restrictive fire lines (RFL), and airspace coordination areas. When supporting the land
component commander, airpower must operate within the confines of all JFLCC
FSCMs. In order to reduce the risk of fratricide and still take advantage of airpower’s
inherent flexibility and versatility, FSCMs must be clearly defined, easily controlled, and
not overly restrictive. For detailed information on FSCMs, see JP 3-09.3.
        Historically, linear operations have used linear FSCMs such as the FSCL.
However, as operations move towards being non-linear, dispersed component AOs
necessitate the need for nonlinear FSCMs such as kill boxes. Advancements in data
link technology and digital information have increased the potential for combat forces to
effectively coordinate and conduct nonlinear operations. Non-linear operations require
Airmen to continually evaluate the capabilities of the controlling ASOC to ensure
adequate resources (manning, radios, frequencies, computer support, etc.) are
available to meet the C2 needs of aircraft operating in ever-increasing dispersed JFLCC
AOs in the JOA. During kill box operations, the CAOC maintains C2 of aircraft outside
the JFLCC’s AO while the ASOC typically maintains responsibility for aircraft inside the
JFLCC’s AO. The following section describes the most significant and controversial
FSCM that pertains to counterland operations—the FSCL.

Fire Support Coordination Line (FSCL)
       The FSCL is a permissive FSCM established and adjusted by appropriate land or
amphibious force commanders within their boundaries in consultation with superior,
subordinate, supporting, and affected commanders. FSCLs facilitate the expeditious
attack of surface targets of opportunity beyond the coordinating measure. The FSCL
does not divide an area of operations by defining a boundary between close and deep
operations or a zone for CAS. The FSCL applies to all fires of air, land, and sea-based
weapons systems using any type of ammunition. Forces attacking targets beyond a
FSCL must inform all affected commanders in sufficient time to allow necessary
reaction to avoid fratricide. Supporting elements attacking targets beyond the FSCL
must ensure the attack will not produce adverse attacks on, or to the rear of, the line.
Short of an FSCL, the appropriate land or amphibious force commander controls all air-
to-ground and surface-to-surface attack operations. The FSCL should follow well-
defined terrain features or use a common reference system. Coordination of attacks
beyond the FSCL is especially critical to commanders of air, land, and special
operations forces.      In exceptional circumstances, the inability to conduct this
coordination will not preclude the attack of targets beyond the FSCL. However, failure
to do so may increase the risk of fratricide and could waste limited resources. The
purpose, establishing authority, employment, and placement of the FSCL must be
understood to effectively execute counterland operations within a surface AO.
       The purpose of the FSCL is to ensure the coordination of fire not under the
surface commander’s control but which may affect his current tactical situation. The
land component commander typically sets the FSCL after coordinating with all affected
component commanders. All attacks short of the FSCL must be coordinated with the
establishing component, primarily to ensure proper integration and prevent fratricide.


                                            68
Because of this, the FSCL is often used as the forward limit of the airspace controlled
by the ASOC. This mandates the various ASOCs and other TACS components have
the required connectivity to monitor not only air activity out to the FSCL but also be able
to monitor friendly and enemy ground positions, surface-to-air threats, and all other key
aspects of situational awareness. Likewise, when the ground component attacks
targets beyond the FSCL (such as long-range ATACMS shots against high-value
targets) it is required to coordinate with the air component to ensure deconfliction and
prevent multiple assets attacking the same target.
        The optimum placement of the FSCL varies with specific battlefield
circumstances, but typically it should be placed where the preponderance of effects on
the battlefield shifts from the ground component to the air component. In this way, the
FSCL placement maximizes the overall effectiveness of the joint force, and each
component will suffer only a small reduction in efficiency. To place the FSCL so deep
or shallow that one component is given complete freedom to operate usually results in
the other components being so restricted that overall joint effectiveness suffers. The
proper location for the FSCL may also shift from one phase of the war to the next,
depending on the scale and scope of each component’s contribution during that phase.
FSCL placement must also take into account the ground scheme of maneuver and
should be based on anticipated, not current, ground force positions at the time the
FSCL will be active. History has shown that placing the FSCL too deep is detrimental to
overall joint force effectiveness and may even provide the enemy a sanctuary from
effective air attack.

    OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM FIRE SUPPORT COORDINATION MEASURES
          OIF employed traditional FSCMs. Because of the Army’s extensive process
  required for changing linear FSCMs, moving the FSCL proved to be a time
  consuming process. Therefore, the initial FSCL was placed well beyond the range of
  land fires in order to accommodate the anticipated rapid movement of land forces
  into Iraq.

          The deep placement of the FSCL hampered the efficiency of airpower.
  Ground forces, and their associated TACPs, were incapable of detailed integration
  beyond the range of their organic fires because no one was able to observe
  adversary targets.      Aircrews were still required to comply with coordination
  procedures short of the FSCL. The time-consuming clearance process hindered the
  expeditious attack of fleeting targets beyond the range of the organic artillery. As a
  result, the area between the maximum range of land fires and the established FSCL
  created a sanctuary for enemy forces.

           The FSCL should be near the maximum operating range of organic tube
  artillery since beyond that point air and space power provides the preponderance of
  effects.




                                            69
         The preponderance of kinetic effects shifts from landpower to airpower
near the maximum range of organic field artillery. Therefore, under all but the
most rapid ground maneuvers, the FSCL is normally placed near the maximum
range of tube artillery because air and space power provides the most
expeditious attack of surface targets beyond that point. To facilitate a rapidly
moving battlefield, a common practice is to establish “on-call FSCLs” in advance that
can be activated as the ground force moves. In the past, establishing the FSCL along
an easily identifiable terrain feature has been critical to success. Modern digitization,
along with advanced navigation equipment such as GPS, has reduced the importance
of this factor. When possible, however, using obvious terrain features for FSCLs can
still prevent errors from happening in the heat and confusion of battle.

        Although normally thought of as a JFLCC responsibility, FSCL placement should
be part of the joint targeting coordination board (JTCB) process. This ensures all
components are able to integrate and maximize effects in support of JFC objectives.
Joint doctrine does not define a depth or range for placing the FSCL in relation to the
FLOT or forward edge of the battle area (FEBA). This permits the theater commander
to tailor FSCL placement according to specific battle conditions that optimize joint
operations. Theater commanders may employ the FSCL to achieve different desired
effects.

        The FSCL is primarily used to establish C2 procedures for planning and
execution purposes—it does not define mission types. Missions flown beyond the
FSCL will typically not use the ASOC, as they are beyond the distance where detailed
integration is required. However, CAS missions can be flown in the portions of the
battlespace beyond the FSCL when friendly troops are operating there and require
support. Ground forces such as SOF teams that often operate deep should include the
appropriate TACS element for CAS control and have a liaison element at the CAOC.
Short of the FSCL, all missions will typically require check-in with the ASOC while en
route to the target for an update on potential targets, surface-to-air threats, and friendly
troop locations. CAS missions will normally be handed off to a JTAC or FAC(A) for
terminal attack control. Even those short-of-the-FSCL missions that usually do not
directly support the ground component, such as counterair or strategic attack, will
normally contact the ASOC/airborne C2 for situation updates and deconfliction while in
the ASOC’s airspace.

       When the land component attacks targets beyond the FSCL, it is required to
coordinate with the CAOC to ensure deconfliction and to prevent multiple assets from
attacking the same target. Land forces that often operate deep such as special
operations teams should include the appropriate TACS element for terminal attack
control and have contact with the SOLE at the CAOC.

Battlefield Coordination Line (BCL)
       The Marine Corps has used an additional FSCM for a Marine-controlled AO,
called a battlefield coordination line, roughly equivalent to the FSCL for an Army-
controlled AO. The BCL is a supplementary FSCM that facilitates the expeditious attack
of surface targets of opportunity. Unlike the FSCL, the BCL is used to help delineate
CAS and AI procedures, and is highly effective when used in conjunction with kill boxes.
Because the BCL is set at the maximum range of organic tube artillery, any sorties
flown short of the BCL are typically designated as CAS. This allows counterland
airpower to attack surface targets beyond the BCL using minimal coordination
procedures with ground forces.




                                            71
          The Marines put in place a supplementary battlefield coordination line to
   speed “expeditious attack of surface targets of opportunity” between the BCL and
   the more distant FSCL as Marine doctrine defined it. A typical BCL extended 18.6
   [kilometers] out from the FLOT—roughly the range of [155] mm artillery. Air strikes
   short of this line were typically Type I, II, or III CAS calling for varying degrees of
   control. Beyond the battlefield coordination line, the “kill boxes” could be opened
   more easily, and the DASC was able to put its brisk procedures into play…. All
   levels monitored the air requests and intervened only to stop them. The DASC was
   co-located with [the fire support coordination center], who updated the ground
   picture as the DASC personnel worked the air picture…. The Marines used
   procedural control with aircraft checking in at control points to give route headings
   which the DASC controller cross-referenced…. Aircrews quickly caught on to the
   fact that the DASC could give them targets fast.… Soon the flow of coalition strike
   sorties, planned and unplanned, far exceeded anything the Marine air planners
   thought the CAOC would give them.

NONLINEAR COORDINATION MEASURES
       In conflicts characterized by nonlinear operations, ground forces occupy pockets
that may have large distances of open terrain between them (often occupied by the
enemy). Under such circumstances, the classic linear concepts such as the FSCL may
need adjustment. One option is to create an alternate FSCM based on a common
reference system (such as a standardized box, circle, or other easily employed shape)
to accomplish the same task that the FSCL performs for the linear battlespace.
Although it is highly effective in nonlinear war, the common reference system is also
very useful in linear operations. The following discussion centers on using a common
reference system and kill boxes.

Area Reference System (ARS)
       An ARS is primarily an operational-level administrative measure used to
coordinate geographical areas rapidly for battlespace deconfliction and synchronization.
An ARS should simplify communications and procedures between the components.

       Commanders may use any ARS they deem appropriate, but if an ARS is
developed without a lead organization or unified effort, separate grid systems may be
developed or used that are not only incompatible but may negatively impact counterland
operations. Global Area Reference System (GARS) is the ARS developed and
approved by the director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, military
Services, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), and the Secretary of Defense as
of December 2005. It is now the standardized battlespace area reference system which



                                           72
impacts not only Service doctrine, joint doctrine, and multi-Service tactics, techniques,
and procedures (MTTP), but also the entire spectrum of battlespace deconfliction.

       The GARS uses a grid system with a simple, universal identifier recognizable by
each component and their associated C2 and attack assets. Three numbers followed
by two letters describe a unique 30-minute by 30-minute area. A graphical depiction of
the proposed reference system is in Figure 4.6. The point of origin for the system is 90
degrees south and 180 degrees east/west. The areas described by GARS are
coincident with even numbered WGS-84 degree and minute lines. Latitude and
longitude coordinate references easily define cells since they are common and exist on
most military operational graphs and charts. They should also allow for easy
interpretation using digital displays common in the tactical weapon systems of all
components. GARS is highly useful in facilitating rapid attacks on TSTs and for
expediting deconfliction of friendly force locations although it is not designed to support
precise targeting. Rather than transmitting a series of latitudes and longitudes, an area
can be defined by a brief yet succinct number/letter character string.




                 Figure 4.6. GARS Layout and Naming Convention

       GARS is also useful because it enables establishment of appropriate control and
coordination measures that can be mutually coordinated, deconflicted, and
synchronized via a simple, common, mutually understood, and agreed upon reference
system. A detailed discussion of GARS is located in JP 2-03, Geospatial Intelligence
Support to Joint Operations. Additional discussion of reference system attributes in



                                            73
general can be found in JP 3-60, Joint Doctrine for Targeting, Appendix D, “Common
Reference Systems: Area and Point”.

Kill Box Operations
       A kill box is a three-dimensional area reference that enables timely, effective
coordination and control and facilitates rapid attacks (JP 1-02). It combines traditional
aspects of both an airspace control measure (ACM) and FSCM, used to facilitate the
expeditious air-to-surface attack of targets, which could also be augmented by or
integrated with surface-to-surface indirect fires. When established, the primary purpose
is to allow air assets to conduct interdiction against surface targets without further
coordination with the establishing commander and without terminal attack control. A kill
box will not be established specifically for CAS missions. When used to integrate air-to-
surface and surface-to-surface fires, the kill box will have appropriate restrictions.
Restrictive FSCMs and ACMs will always have priority when established in a kill box.
For an in-depth discussion, see AFTTP (I) 3-2.59, Kill Box.

       A kill box is established and adjusted by the appropriate supported commander
and is an extension of an existing support relationship established by the JFC. Kill box
boundaries normally are defined using an area reference system (e.g., GARS), but
could follow other boundaries such as well-defined terrain features or may be located by
grid or by a radius from a center point. Changes to a kill box require notification of all
affected forces within the JOA and must allow sufficient time for these forces and/or
components to incorporate the kill box change. When building a kill box construct, the
entire JOA can be mapped using an ARS (such as grids and keypads used in the
GARS) before the start of an operation or campaign.

       Tactical fire support control procedures within a theater of operations may use
colors and specific terminology to describe the status of kill boxes within a JOA.

          Blue Kill Box. A blue kill box permits air-to-surface fires effects in the kill box
          without further coordination with the establishing headquarters.

          Purple Kill Box. A purple kill box permits the integration of surface-to-
          surface fires with air-to-surface fires into the purple kill box without further
          coordination.

          Established. A kill box that is in effect, either via the joint targeting cycle or
          execution period. Information about the time it becomes effective, the
          duration, or other attributes will be published and disseminated in the ACO.

          Open. Term used to describe a portion or portions of a kill box that are open
          to fires without further coordination or deconfliction. An established kill box is
          inherently open, until closed or cancelled. (AFTTP [I] 3-2.59)

          Active. An established kill box that has aircraft flying in the space defined by
          the box or effects of air or other joint fires within the boundaries of the kill box.


                                             74
          Cold. An established kill box that is not active. All portions of the kill box are
          open to fires unless identified as closed.

          Closed. Term used to describe a portion or portions of an established kill box
          in which fires or effects of fires are not allowed without further coordination.

          Cancelled. The kill box is no longer in effect.

        Although use of kill boxes is not mandatory, the kill box system reduces the
coordination required to fulfill support requirements with maximum flexibility. Kill boxes
support the commander’s objectives and concept of operations, including designated
target priority, effects, and timing of fires. C2 updates on kill boxes will be accomplished
(e.g., altitude restrictions, frequency use, established control measures within the kill
box) via appropriate C2 systems. With appropriate restrictions, surface-to-surface fires
may occur simultaneously with air-to-surface strikes. Kill boxes can augment use of
traditional FSCMs, such as FSCL, CFL, and BCL. They can help the commander focus
the effort of air assets. When traditional FSCMs are not useful or are less applicable,
the kill box can be the primary method for identifying areas to focus air assets in. Five
factors should be considered when building a kill box system.

          A kill box is an ACM/FSCM, and is not a reference system. Kill box
          boundaries are normally defined using an area reference system, which
          provides the construct (a two-dimensional system), and a kill box is the
          application. The addition of altitude restrictions makes a kill box a three-
          dimensional paradigm.

          Applicable ROE, collateral damage guidance and restrictions, PID, and the
          SPINS must still be followed in a kill box.

          The decision to use a kill box requires careful consideration by the controlling
          authority. If used, its size, location, and timing is based on estimates of the
          situation and concept of operations.          The commander must consider
          disposition of enemy forces, friendly forces, anticipated rates of movement,
          concept and tempo of the operation, surface-to-surface weapon capabilities,
          and other factors.

          A kill box is an ACM/FSCM that may contain other measures within its
          boundaries (e.g., NFA, restricted operating zones [ROZ], and airspace
          coordination areas).

          Integration of air-to-surface and surface-to-surface fires requires application
          of appropriate restrictions: altitude, time separation, or lateral separation.
          The supported commander will determine which of these is appropriate for
          the mission and ensure dissemination through the appropriate C2 nodes.




                                            75
                       Figure 4.7. Notional Kill Box Construct

       The CAOC is the CFACC’s C2 element responsible for coordinating fires in
CFACC-controlled kill boxes. Other components must coordinate with the CAOC prior
to entering or engaging targets in a CFACC kill box. This is normally done through the
various liaison elements attached to the CAOC, i.e., the BCD, the NALE, the MARLO,
and the SOLE. Through the ATO, the CAOC tasks airpower to enter and engage
targets in kill boxes without further coordination with other components
        The ASOC is the CFACC’s agency for coordinating the use of airpower in JFLCC
kill boxes. Through the TACS-AAGS, the ASOC funnels airpower to JFLCC kill boxes.
The ASOC has authority to divert airpower between JFLCC kill boxes, but the CAOC
retains the authority to divert air assets from CFACC to JFLCC kill boxes or vice versa.
        Traditional FSCM concepts still have a place in kill box operations. In place of
“on-call FSCLs,” C2 measures must be established to quickly transfer kill boxes from
CFACC to JFLCC control to accommodate cases of rapid friendly land force movement.
In these cases, the ACCE liaison to the JFLCC, the BCD liaison to the CAOC, the
CAOC’s communications with the ASOC, and the senior ALO interface with the senior
tactical land commander are critical. FLOTs still exist in kill box operations. However,
as operations become more non-linear, FLOT definition becomes more difficult.


                                          76
Between the time an aircrew steps to an aircraft and when the aircrew arrives in the kill
box, the FLOT may change dramatically. During non-linear operations (with or without
kill boxes), ASOC resource requirements increase.          However, procedures for
transferring kill boxes from CFACC to JFLCC control and the ACCE’s liaison to the
JFLCC on AI target nominations take on added importance.
       The JFSOCC may task STT to support the CFACC in CFACC kill boxes. These
taskings may include finding and fixing targets as well as providing laser designation
support (autonomous terminal guidance operations). Although these scenarios do not
constitute CAS, they do require some coordination. This necessitates that air assets
coordinate with the JFSOCC’s C2 structure before entering or attacking targets in the
keypads.

Combined Kill Box and Traditional FSCM Operations
        A combination of kill box and traditional FSCMs is possible, such as when a
single large advance is made from a classic linear battlefield (such as operations during
OIF). Here the standard FSCL could be used for the slower moving ground forces, and
a localized JFLCC kill box system could be created in front of, or behind, a rapid
advance. This allows for more efficient air attack on non-engaged enemy land forces,
the greatest freedom of land and aerial maneuver, and enhanced combat
effectiveness—especially during non-linear operations.
       C2 of air and space power in these situations is conducted through the TACS as
previously discussed. The ASOC is responsible for all air operations short of the FSCL
as well in JFLCC kill boxes. The CAOC maintains responsibility for airpower operations
beyond the FSCL and in CFACC kill boxes.

SUMMARY
        Understanding the TACS is crucial to effective counterland operations. Air
operations are centrally controlled through the CAOC and decentrally executed by the
lower echelon elements of the TACS. FSCMs must be flexible and efficient for the
successful employment of counterland operations. The FSCL is an important FSCM in
linear combat operations while the kill box system is suited for either linear/non-linear or
contiguous/non-contiguous conflicts.
        Theater commanders are beginning to employ kill boxes in lieu of or in
combination with FSCLs to facilitate expeditious coordination of effects. Digitization of
the battlespace aids this effort as it dramatically increases situational awareness and
will significantly improve the commanders’ ability to rapidly attack threats through proper
kill box management. Kill boxes also provide one way to do counterland targeting in
near-real time against mobile ground forces that defy long range preplanning. The use
of kill boxes improves coordination and control measures throughout the JOA and
provides a tool to help manage nonlinear and integrated joint operations.

                CONDUCTING COUNTERLAND OPERATIONS

       We are not preparing the battlefield, we are destroying it.
         —Sign posted in the “Black Hole” planning cell during DESERT STORM




        Air and space power has attributes that allow it to be employed in diverse and
multiple combat tasks across the joint operations area. However, there is rarely enough
air and space power available to satisfy all demands. Effective counterland operations
call for centralized control and decentralized execution. The CFACC optimizes the use
of normally scarce air and space assets through centralized control. Centralized control
also minimizes undue dissipation and fragmentation of effort and ensures coherence
and focus on essential JFC objectives. Because no single commander can personally
direct all the detailed actions of a typical complement of assigned and available air and
space forces, decentralized execution of air missions is necessary and is accomplished
by delegating appropriate authority for detailed mission planning and execution.
Decentralized execution ensures effective employment of limited assets, allows tactical
adaptation, and accommodates the Services' different employment concepts and
procedures.

       The intent of this chapter is to give commanders and planners a broad
perspective on planning and employment considerations for counterland operations.
Detailed discussion of the air and space estimate process and the air tasking cycle is
contained in AFDD 2, Operations and Organization, and AFDD 2-1.9, Targeting,
respectively. This chapter will begin with broad planning considerations for course of
action development and then discuss elements pertinent to each phase of the air
tasking cycle.

BASIC PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS

Supporting Counterland Operations
       Both AI and CAS operations require the full spectrum of support, from logistics to
force protection to administrative services. Logistics and other combat support are key
enablers to counterland operations. Key factors affecting logistics supportability include
force beddown and base support planning, deployment and sustainment of munitions
and fuel, and maintenance support for critical spares. A robust air mobility capability,
especially for intratheater movement, is critical for getting this logistical support to the
bases that require it. As an expeditionary force, these key support issues assume even
greater importance. This section highlights some of the support aspects that are
particularly important to the counterland function.


                                            78
        Munitions Requirements. As the arsenal of precision-guided munitions that
        can be employed in counterland continues to grow, maintaining proper stocks
        at operating locations becomes increasingly important. There will usually be
        tradeoffs involved in deciding which weapons to employ against specific
        targets, and availability will often be a factor. Proper knowledge of the
        munitions available at each air base, carrier battle group, etc., along with their
        weapons resupply capability, is mandatory. Those munitions with the
        greatest potential for accuracy, destructiveness, or standoff range are often in
        the shortest supply. Targeteers and weaponeers should keep in mind factors
        such as anticipated length of the campaign, munitions needs of the various
        campaign phases, and tradeoffs of each weapons type when making
        munitions recommendations.

                     AIR REFUELING—A CRITICAL ENABLER




        Air refueling is a key part of most air component operations and extends the
range, payload, and endurance of counterland assets, thereby increasing their
effectiveness. In some cases, counterland missions would not be possible at all
without air refueling capability. As this DESERT STORM photo of an Air Force KC-
135 refueling Marine F/A-18s demonstrates, air refueling is a key factor in all air
component operations, whether US Air Force, other Service, or allied nation forces
are involved. Air refueling is a key enabler to initial force deployment as well, since
most counterland aircraft lack the range to deploy directly to or from the combat
theater on their own.


        Air Refueling. Air Force air refueling aircraft have evolved from their
        traditional role of supporting long range strategic attack to become an
        essential, integrated part of counterland force packaging. Tanker aircraft are
        a force multiplier that enhances, or in some cases enables, counterland
        operations by allowing access to a wider range of targets and payloads.
        Station times will be increased for airborne alert AI and CAS missions,


                                          79
          providing decreased response times and increasing the counterland effect on
          the enemy. One of the key tasks for ATO production teams is to optimize use
          of the available tankers; availability of refueling booms and drogues is often
          the limiting factor that determines how many counterland targets can be
          attacked in a given cycle.

        While technically a “support” asset, air refueling has become such an integrated
part of counterland force packaging that it would be difficult to imagine operating without
the enhanced capabilities it provides. For example, enemy antiship defenses may force
an aircraft carrier to stand off from the counterland area, requiring Air Force refueling
support to get carrier aviation to the fight. When air superiority is in dispute, and enemy
aircraft and missiles threaten air bases close to the ground fighting, air refueling may be
the only way to get counterland missions to the fight from protected bases further to the
rear.

Target Development
         During target development, the planned targeting process should relate specific
targets to objectives, desired effects, and accompanying actions. Target development
requires thorough examination of the adversary as a system to understand where
critical linkages and vulnerabilities lie. Target development involves four distinct
functions: 1) target analysis, 2) target validation, 3) target nomination, and 4) collection
and exploitation requirements. The product of this phase is the joint integrated
prioritized target list (JIPTL). AFDD 2-1.9, Targeting, provides information on air
planning and the targeting process.

        Once potential targets are identified, intelligence provides precise location of
individual target elements, status of defenses, and other information necessary for the
detailed planning of counterland missions. Warfare is dynamic and demands that
friendly forces adapt their methods to cope with enemy responses. The ability to detect,
assess, and properly choose targets is a function of several attributes discussed in the
following paragraphs.

         The suitability of a target set for attack is often decided by a combination of its
criticality and vulnerability. For example, fewer conveyances and depots in an enemy
transportation system increase the enemy's dependence on that system, therefore,
each potential target in that transportation system becomes more critical. Conversely,
an enemy possessing a varied, dispersed transportation system is less operationally
vulnerable to infrastructure interdiction. Tactical vulnerability refers to the ease of
attacking a particular target, based on hardening, defenses, etc., once it has been
identified that the attack will produce the desired effects. Tactical vulnerability is
important, as the benefit of attacking a target must be balanced against the expected
cost. Timing is also key to a particular target’s criticality to the enemy. For example,
rotary-wing forces typically operate from forward arming and refueling points that are
mobile and thus not exceedingly hardened. Catching an enemy helicopter force at such
a location could yield high payoffs in terms of both forces and infrastructure destroyed.
When marshalling for an attack, or deploying for transport to the forward area, ground


                                            80
combat units may be exceedingly vulnerable for short periods. The enemy may risk this
temporary vulnerability in order to get their forces into combat, but proper friendly
intelligence can create opportunities for high payoff attacks by allowing planners to
focus on the exact time of maximum enemy vulnerability.

       Mobile targets will normally require a different approach than fixed targets,
whether attacking actual enemy combat forces or their fielded support. Modern sensors
such as moving target indicators can often locate and compute accurate bombing
solutions for any moving vehicle on a battlefield, and the heat generated by operating
engines and equipment often makes mobile units easily located by either onboard
sensors or precision-guided munitions. In some theaters, the CAOC employs a
dynamic targeting cell to ensure planning both maximizes the effectiveness of
counterland attack on mobile targets and integrates the effort with the ground scheme of
maneuver. Fixed targets may be harder to identify with onboard sensors and may be
more hardened against weapons effects, but their fixed nature makes target location
easier and simplifies targeting by weapons such as GPS-aided bombs or missiles.

       Environmental factors need consideration during target development. Target
area environmental conditions include terrain features, adverse weather, time of
day/night, humidity and temperature effects, solar activity, and active or passive
defense measures (such as smoke and camouflage). These may act to conceal
targets, reduce visibility, and degrade weapon systems and overall counterland
capabilities. Lunar illumination and weather conditions can drastically affect the ability
of onboard sensors to both locate and identify targets. Terrain features may restrict
target acquisition in some bandwidths, thus requiring specialized weapons, sensors,
and tactics. The flexibility of different sensors and munitions that allow use of optical,
near and far spectrum infrared (IR), radar, and GPS for target acquisition, marking, and
weapons guidance gives the counterland planner many options to counter the natural
and artificial obstacles to success. However, the flexibility of these same sensors and
weapons may be limited depending on environment conditions

      During the target development phase, planners should coordinate with other
organizations and components to prevent fratricide, collateral damage, or a propaganda
advantage for the enemy. Extensive coordination is required with the land component
and SOLE to facilitate this. Examples of operations requiring this level of coordination
are personnel recovery and information operations, to include public affairs.

       The JFSOCC must deconflict special operations through the JFC and with the
other component commanders to avoid fratricide. CAOC personnel should work
through the BCD within the CAOC and the ASOC to ensure that air and space
component targeting is coordinated with and deconflicted from land component
operations. Careful crafting and placement of FSCMs can facilitate this.




                                           81
Urban Considerations
        Unless specifically stated otherwise, Air Force doctrine applies to the full range of
military operations, as appropriate, from stability, security, transition, and reconstruction
operations to major operations and campaigns. Doctrine for joint urban operations,
outlined in JP 3-06, describes the triad of terrain, population, and infrastructure that
must be considered before and during operations in that environment. Urban warfare is
specific to an environment, and should not be substituted with related terms of irregular
or asymmetric warfare.

        While urban environments vary greatly, challenges to counterland operations can
be expected in identification of combatants, collateral damage, preservation of
infrastructure, restrictive rules of engagement, line-of-sight issues (to include targeting
as well as communications), and freedom of maneuver. C2 of air power does not
change in the urban environment, but tactics, techniques, and procedures may be vastly
different from those employed on the open battlefield.

         Planners must consider that ground operations will be largely decentralized due
to communication limitations, and coordination will be time-consuming to prevent
fratricide and mitigate collateral damage. Large munitions may be traded for increased
loiter time in fuel, as smaller precise weapons with tailored effects are more desirable
for employment.

        Collateral damage in cities or towns that have not been evacuated will represent
a great risk that must be considered and minimized. One real, alleged, or staged
collateral damage or fratricide event can have strategic impact, affecting ROE, SPINS,
host nation restrictions on operations, etc. Planners should integrate public affairs and
psychological operations into counterland operations from strategy development
through mission execution. Public information planners must be involved early in the
process to mitigate negative events and leverage successes during counterland
operations. Next, planners need to account for weather effects caused by the urban
environment.      Factors include increased pollution and aerosols affecting target
detection, warmer temperatures affecting IR signatures, and variable wind speeds
affected by building layout. Finally, urban operations, by their very nature, involve
significant law of armed conflict considerations. In particular, commanders and aircrew
must determine whether the operation is a military necessity and whether the potential
harm to noncombatants outweighs the importance of the operation.

       CAS will be difficult when supporting house-to-house ground fighting, where the
task of locating and identifying friendly positions may prove highly demanding. Locating
the proper enemy targets will also be more difficult, and the obstructions due to
multistory structures will hamper both sensor and weapon line-of-sight. Techniques
such as overlaying tactical charts and local street maps may prove useful in identifying
enemy and friendly positions. CAS in an urban environment requires increased reliance
on friendly ground forces to locate and mark targets, since enemy combat units will
often be concealed inside buildings. Aircrew will have to give extra attention to the axis


                                             82
of attack and target designation; the problem may be similar to attacking enemy forces
in steep mountainous terrain. Larger urban areas with more vertically developed
buildings add increased elevation issues to the targeting problem, and the combination
of tall buildings and narrow streets can cause an “urban canyon” effect leading to
masking issues for line-of-sight munitions and targeting sensors. Munitions effects will
vary greatly depending on whether the enemy can be attacked in the open versus inside
buildings, requiring both patience and flexibility for mission success. When performing
CAS in an urban environment, buildings may interfere with communications between air
and ground, complicating the coordination process. Ground forces may also have
difficulty marking targets for CAS aircraft in an urban environment, and careful
consideration must be given to the type of terminal attack control selected. The AC-130
gunship and PGM-equipped fighters using small diameter munitions have proven
particularly effective in many urban operations with their combination of precision
accuracy and wide range of onboard sensors. The AC-130 and MQ-1 Predator have
been useful in urban environments, where extended loiter times are often necessary to
pinpoint target sets in close proximity to noncombatants.

Irregular Warfare
        Unless specifically stated otherwise, Air Force doctrine applies to the full range of
military operations. Irregular warfare, as of the date of this document, is not defined in
Air Force or Joint publications. If it is to follow the concept for irregular forces defined in
JP 1-02, irregular warfare may be defined as warfare performed by armed individuals or
groups who are not members of the regular armed forces, police, or other internal
security forces. Irregular warfare is not urban warfare, and may or may not be
conducted in that environment. Because they share similar challenges, the misuse of
terminology is easy to make. Like urban warfare, irregular warfare will likely have
increased levels of deception, proximity and confusion with noncombatants, restrictive
rules of engagement, and reduced ability to mass forces upon the enemy. In irregular
warfare, technologically superior forces can be challenged by an elusive adversary that
refuses to mass, and adapts to target the superior force asymmetrically. The primary
distinction to be drawn is that irregular warfare is conducted by irregular forces.
Irregular warfare includes a wide variety of operations and activities that occur either in
isolation or within traditional types of operations (see AFDD 2).

       Within irregular warfare, there are two general approaches: waging irregular
warfare (primarily offensive in nature) and countering irregular threats (primarily
defensive in nature). While they appear to represent two opposite ends of the
spectrum, they do share similarities: they both include protraction, intertwining military
and non-military methods, participation by violent individuals and groups that do not
belong to the regular armed forces or police of any state, and a struggle for control or
influence over, and the support of, the host population.




                                              83
Weaponeering and Allocation

       Weaponeering is the process of estimating the quantity and types of lethal and
nonlethal weapons needed to achieve desired effects against specific targets.
Weaponeering considers such things as the desired effects against the target (both
direct weapons effects and indirect desired outcomes), target vulnerability, delivery
accuracy, damage criteria, and weapon reliability. Targeting personnel quantify the
expected results of lethal and nonlethal weapons employment against prioritized targets
to produce desired effects.

         Weapons effects are always a critical part of targeting for counterland. Some
munitions and fuses are designed for very specific applications and are effective against
certain targets with little or no capability against others. Good intelligence data on
target information is vital to the proper matching of munition to target. Likewise, the
flexibility of some munitions and fuses to provide multiple effects allows planners
options for maximum effect against preplanned targets, and in many cases allows
inflight selection of weapons/fuse settings for dynamic targets. The latter capability is
especially important for CAS and XAI, when the specific target type is not normally
known prior to takeoff. When possible, combat aircraft should have a variety of
munitions to meet operational requirements.

       Allocation is the distribution of limited resources among competing requirements
for employment. Allocation assigns specific air assets and targets against the
apportionment priorities. After allocation, the master air attack plan is created that
matches assets against AI and strategic targets. Following allocation, the distribution
process matches CAS assets against support requests, which should be planned by the
ASOC in conjunction with ground force planning. The final step of the process is the
actual ATO production, which packages the attacking and supporting assets to achieve
optimum effect against the enemy.

       AI targets nominated by the ground component are not often presented in the
standardized “basic encyclopedia” (BE) number designation, which is another reason to
retain flexibility in counterland planning. If the ground component needs a particular
enemy unit attacked, and that unit meets the requisite priority criteria, planners must
ensure that particular enemy unit is affected to the level required. This requires the
CAOC planners to maintain awareness of that enemy unit’s position; the BCD can help
with this task. Instead of concern over a particular enemy unit, the ground component
may have a certain geographic area of concern to its scheme of maneuver. In this
case, the friendly ground force requires an attack on any enemy forces that happen to
be there. Planning methods must therefore allow for either an area or unit-specific
focus for AI targeting, especially for ground-nominated targets. Attacks against large
ground forces are most effective when prioritized targeting guidance is included in the
nomination, such as artillery first, armor second, etc. When possible, however, air
support can be most effective when the ground component specifies mission-type
orders or desired effects against an enemy unit, such as “delay enemy X Brigade 72
hours from achieving contact” or “fix enemy Y Division in place for 48 hours.” The air-


                                           84
ground system works best when the ground component requests overall battlefield
effects, rather than specific targets, due to the greater ability of the air component to
analyze the enemy force for proper air and space power targeting.

       Before the actual ATO is put into production, justified changes to targets and
targeting priority can be incorporated. Once the ATO is put into final production,
approved changes are typically passed on to the combat operations division for
incorporation either at tactical unit level planning or during actual mission execution. If
the enemy ground force does move to an unexpected location, it is not likely to have
moved far enough to require much repackaging of counterland missions. This allows
for a relatively simple retargeting of a given flight or strike package to the new target
location. Any changes must account for differing air defenses, proximity to friendly
ground forces, and other factors before final approval.

       For those missions where lucrative targets are highly likely, but preplanned
locations are not available, airborne or ground alert may be appropriate. This is the
most common method employed for CAS, where there is typically not a pre-identified
target prior to mission execution. Airborne alert AI can be used to provide up-to-the-
minute flexibility, where final targeting guidance comes from offboard sources such as
JSTARS or UA. Airborne alert missions should only be planned when lucrative targets
are likely to exist, otherwise the missions will be wasted. The “push” system of
providing preplanned backup targets for both CAS and AI alleviates this problem to
some extent; this procedure gives each mission a fixed target of some military value in
case the primary target fails to materialize.

EXECUTION PLANNING AND FORCE EXECUTION
       Execution planning includes the preparation necessary for combat units to
accomplish the decentralized execution of the ATO. It generally consists of the 12
hours immediately prior to the start of a given day’s ATO execution period. Force
execution refers to the 24-hour period in which a particular ATO is executed by combat
units. The CAOC assists in preparing input for, supporting, and monitoring execution.
This section briefly touches on these topics to make the reader aware of its connection
with counterland operations. For more information, see AFDD 2-1.9, Targeting.
       During execution, the CAOC is the central agency for revising the tasking of air
and space forces. It is also responsible for coordinating and deconflicting any changes
with appropriate agencies or components. Due to battlespace dynamics, the CFACC
may be required to make changes to planned operations during execution. The CAOC
must be flexible and responsive to changes required during execution of the ATO.
Forces not apportioned for joint or combined operations, but included on the ATO for
coordination purposes, can be redirected only with the approval of the respective
component or allied commanders. During execution, the CFACC is also responsible for
retargeting air assets to respond to moving targets or changing priorities.
      Dynamic targeting includes the prosecution of targets that emerge during ATO
execution that commanders deem worthy of prosecution. The dynamic targeting


                                            85
process is not separate from the air tasking cycle or planned targeting process and is
time-sensitive to some degree. The combat operations division (COD) has overall
responsibility for implementation of the dynamic targeting process. Successful dynamic
targeting, however, requires a great deal of prior planning and coordination with other
divisions within the CAOC and with other components. If dynamic targeting is to be
done correctly, planners must decide upon CONOPS that make assets available to the
COD prior to the start of execution. This can be done in a number of ways. Among the
most common methods are:
          Preplanned target reference methods and FSCM such as kill boxes.

          Pre-positioned or on-call ISR and strike packages for rapid response to
          emerging targets.

          Using intelligence preparation of the operational environment (IPOE) to
          determine the most probable areas where targets will emerge during
          execution.

          Coordination and synchronization of dynamic targeting operations by
          streamlining and developing procedures for rapid handover of the mission
          tasking to another component for mission execution if the air and space
          component cannot attack a target that emerges.

       LNOs from other components or Services may be very helpful during the
dynamic targeting process. LNOs—particularly the SOLE—may be able to provide the
CFACC with additional options for dealing with emerging targets and may be able to
provide locations and activities of SOF and other friendly forces to assist with the
F2T2EA of counterland targets, or to at least assist in deconfliction.

AIR-GROUND INTEGRATION
        A quick survey of the various types of ground maneuver reveals some insight as
to how counterland operations should be employed when directly supporting the ground
battle. The same survey yields some lessons for employing ground forces when air and
space power provides the bulk of battlefield effects on the enemy. The important
question does not focus on which component is the more decisive, but how best to
combine the available air and surface combat power for the quickest and most cost
effective victory.

        During the movement to contact by ground forces, the initial combat between
friendly and enemy units will occur using supporting air assets and artillery.
Counterland’s main contribution during this phase is AI—to disrupt the enemy forces
that will subsequently be engaged by friendly ground units, or to destroy them prior to
contact. Enemy second echelon forces are also valuable targets in this phase, when AI
seeks to isolate the enemy front-line units from their support and reinforcements.
Ground forces may make good use of organic rotary-wing assets to screen ahead and



                                          86
to the flanks during movement to contact, a task that can be supplemented by fixed-
wing counterland assets when needed.

        Meeting engagements occur when friendly and enemy ground forces engage
while both are on the move. Hasty attacks occur with little time for detailed planning,
typically within 24 hours of first contact with the enemy. In both of these modes of
ground combat, there may not be time for the normal target nomination and air
component apportionment processes to occur before missions must be flown.
Depending on the amount of air support required, and other theater priorities for air and
space power, missions may be diverted or reroled to fly CAS or AI missions. Since
preplanned targets may not be available, counterland assets may be forced into greater
use of airborne alert or general grid box target locations for AI missions. Flexibility will
be paramount because enemy vulnerabilities that are susceptible to air attack may
appear on short notice. Under these circumstances, it is especially important for the
ASOC and TACPs to remain tightly integrated with their ground component
counterparts, as confusion over both friendly and enemy troop positions and
movements is likely.

        A hasty ground engagement may often be the result of a desire to attack quickly
to surprise the enemy, so they will likely be suffering from the same short-notice
reaction that affects friendly planning and air-ground coordination. When significant
friendly counterland assets are not available or when air superiority has not been
achieved, the friendly ground force should be cautious about schemes of maneuver that
increase the likelihood of meeting engagements or hasty attacks, unless sufficient
organic surface firepower exists to deal with the enemy force.

       A deliberate attack occurs when adequate time for planning and coordination
exists; this is the preferred mode of ground advance. Air and ground components will
have time for properly detailed coordination, establish on-call FSCLs, nominate
appropriate AI targets to achieve desired battlefield results, and ensure air superiority
that minimizes the enemy’s use of air to support their own army.

        Exploitation of breakthroughs into the enemy rear, potentially combined with the
use of airborne or air assault forces, achieves maximum disruption when combined with
counterland aerial maneuver. Integrated air-ground operations against the enemy,
possibly over a multi-phased offensive, require the advanced planning that only a
deliberate attack provides. The need for both flexibility and close coordination between
air and ground components grows as friendly ground forces push deeper into enemy
territory. The rate of ground advance must continually be balanced with the
effectiveness of air attack in achieving theater objectives and with the relative merits of
ground versus air and space maneuver as they come into play. Proper advancement of
the FSCL is one of the key issues during rapid ground advance as the factors of air and
space power effectiveness, potential fratricide, and freedom of ground maneuver are
weighed.




                                            87
        A spoiling attack is launched from a defensive position to disrupt a forming
enemy offensive and may act to divert enemy attention from the main ground offensive
to be launched elsewhere. Since disruption of the enemy is the main objective, the use
of counterland can contribute greatly to success. Enemy forces may be particularly
vulnerable while marshalling for an attack, and second-echelon forces may be more
vulnerable to AI while moving up to reinforce an enemy offensive. Successful
interdiction of enemy exploitation forces may persuade the enemy to call off an attack,
since they would then have no ground force to consolidate any gains.

        Mobile defense is a concept in which friendly ground forces use fire and
movement tactics over a given area to slow and disrupt the enemy advance. Air and
space power’s greatest contribution to mobile defense may be with AI close to the
battlefield to slow the enemy’s movement through destruction of POL, lines of
communication, and other infrastructure targets whose destruction will guarantee that
friendly ground forces retain greater mobility than the enemy. In mobile defense both
the friendly and enemy positions can become difficult to accurately track, and the
ASOCs and TACPs again become a critical link when heavy CAS is required. The risk
of fratricide will increase during mobile operations, so organic surface firepower should
always be used when available.

        Area defense is more static and involves a direct confrontation with the enemy
along a defensible line of contact. Under these circumstances counterland missions
can be flown in closer proximity to ground forces with reduced chance of fratricide, and
the more static nature of the conflict will reduce the impact of attacks on enemy mobility.
Enemy ammunition stocks, artillery tubes, and rocket launchers may become higher
priority targets for AI and CAS during area defense. If air superiority is challenged or
lost, friendly surface forces in static positions will likely become very vulnerable to
enemy air and missile attack, since fixed ground positions are vulnerable to a lower
level of air and space technology than mobile forces.

       Target defenses may distract aircrews and hamper their ability to identify and
attack targets. Detection assets like JSTARS, or intelligence sources such as human
and imagery intelligence will often enhance target acquisition capability. However,
enemy air defenses may still hamper the aircrews’ ability to visually acquire their
targets, due to required high speeds, low or very high altitudes, or restricted ingress
routing necessary to minimize the risk of engagement. Effective force packaging can
negate the impact of enemy air defenses and achieve temporary local air superiority. A
longer-lasting effect is achieved by first eliminating or negating enemy surface-to-air
defenses as part of an overall air superiority operation. Many current SEAD assets are
multirole, and once the bulk of the enemy surface-to-air defense has been eliminated
these forces can be reroled into the main counterland effort. Missions against CAS
targets can often use ground force artillery, rockets, and attack helicopters to suppress
enemy air defenses, which also free fixed-wing assets to directly attack the primary
targets. The ground component also possesses a limited capability to suppress enemy
air defenses at longer ranges through the use of ATACMS and attack helicopter assets.




                                            88
SUMMARY
       It cannot be overemphasized that proper counterland planning, as with all air
component planning, requires a full consideration of the capabilities and limitations of air
and space power during the initial development of overall theater strategy. Historically,
theater campaign planners have taken a land-centric view of how the campaign should
unfold through its various phases, then examined how airpower would support it. This
approach is inefficient, especially in light of the fact that in recent campaigns, airpower
has been responsible for damaging or destroying the majority of enemy systems.

        True joint planning requires that all components be equally involved in planning
the various stages of a military campaign. How counterland fits into the larger picture of
a specific strategy will depend on numerous variables, but there should be no
preconceived notions about the decisiveness of any one component. Instead of
individual component decisiveness, it is better to plan in terms of the required
components of a decisive joint force. Likewise, friction and the fog of war should never
be ruled out. Any plan that assumes perfect knowledge of the enemy is doomed to
failure; proper counterland planning must provide some last-minute flexibility for reaction
to unanticipated enemy movement.

       Counterland requires effective training and education to ensure success in war.
“Train like you fight” is the prevailing training philosophy in the United States Air Force.
This strongly applies to counterland operations because the various interconnected
parts that comprise this capability must be trained and thoroughly exercised by all
parties if success in combat is to be achieved. AI requires accurate intelligence,
thorough planning, and flexible execution to achieve desired effects, whether conducted
independently or indirectly supporting surface forces. The orchestration required by the
air and ground components in the CAS environment can make it one of the most difficult
missions performed by the Air Force. To integrate effectively within the combined force,
Airmen must accomplish realistic training scenarios, share ideas within the joint
community, and advocate the proper use of counterland air and space power. Only
then will the investment of peacetime preparation pay exponential dividends during
combat.

Definitions

air interdiction. Air operations conducted to destroy, neutralize, or delay the
enemy's military potential before it can be brought to bear effectively against
friendly forces at such distance from friendly forces that detailed integration of
each air mission with the fire and movement of friendly forces is not required. (JP
1-02) [Air operations conducted to divert, disrupt, delay, or destroy the enemy’s
military potential before it can be brought to bear effectively against friendly
forces, or to otherwise achieve joint force commander objectives. Air interdiction
is conducted at such distance from friendly forces that detailed integration of
each air mission with the fire and movement of friendly forces is not required.
Also called AI.] [AFDD 2-1.3] {Words in brackets apply only to the Air Force and
are offered for clarity.}

air liaison officer. The senior tactical air control party member attached to a
ground unit who functions as the primary advisor to the ground commander on
air power. An air liaison officer is usually an aeronautically rated officer. Also
called ALO. (JP 1-02)

basic encyclopedia. A compilation of identified installations and physical areas


                                            96
of potential significance as objectives for attack. Also called BE. (JP 1-02)

boundary. A line that delineates surface areas for the purpose of facilitating
coordination and deconfliction of operations between adjacent units, formations,
or areas. (JP 1-02)

campaign. A series of related military operations aimed at accomplishing a
strategic or operational objective within a given time and space. (JP 1-02)

campaign plan. A plan for a series of related military operations aimed at
accomplishing a strategic or operational objective within a given time and space.
(JP 1-02)

close air support. Air action by fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft against hostile
targets that are in close proximity to friendly forces and that require detailed
integration of each air mission with the fire and movement of those forces. Also
called CAS. (JP 1-02)

close proximity. As used in relation to close air support, close proximity refers
to the distance within which some form of terminal attack control is required for
targeting direction and fratricide prevention. (AFDD 2-1.3)

counterland. Air and space operations against enemy land force capabilities to
create effects that achieve joint force commander objectives. The main
objectives of counterland operations are to dominate the surface environment
and prevent the opponent from doing the same. (AFDD 1)

detailed integration. As used in relation to close air support (CAS), detailed
integration refers to the level of coordination required to achieve the desired
effects without overly restricting CAS attacks, surface firepower, or the ground
scheme of maneuver. It is also necessary to protect aircraft from the unintended
effects of friendly surface fire. The maximum range requiring detailed integration
is typically bounded by the range at which organic surface firepower provides the
preponderance of effect on the enemy. (AFDD 2-1.3)

forward air controller. An officer (aviator/pilot) member of the tactical air control
party who, from a forward ground or airborne position, controls aircraft in close
air support of ground troops. Also called FAC. (JP 1-02)

forward air controller (airborne). A specifically trained and qualified aviation
officer who exercises control from the air of aircraft engaged in close air support
of ground troops. The forward air controller (airborne) is normally an airborne
extension of the tactical air control party. Also called FAC(A). (JP 1-02)

fratricide. The employment of weapons by friendly forces which results in the
unintentional death, injury, or damage to US, allied, or coalition personnel,


                                             97
equipment, or facilities. (AFDD 2-1.3)

interdiction. An action to divert, disrupt, delay, or destroy the enemy's surface
military potential before it can be used effectively against friendly forces. See
also air interdiction. (JP 1-02) [Interdiction operations are joint actions to divert,
disrupt, delay, or destroy the enemy’s military potential before it can be used
effectively against friendly forces, or to otherwise meet joint force commander
objectives.] (AFDD 2-1.3)

joint. Connotes activities, operations, organizations, etc., in which elements of
two or more Military Departments participate. (JP 1-02)

joint doctrine. Fundamental principles that guide the employment of US military
forces in coordinated action toward a common objective. Joint doctrine contained
in joint publications also includes terms, tactics, techniques, and procedures. It is
authoritative but requires judgment in application. (JP 1-02)

joint fires. Fires produced during the employment of forces from two or more
components in coordinated action toward a common objective. (JP 1-02)

joint fires observer. A trained Service member who can request, adjust, and
control surface-to-surface fires, provide targeting information in support of type 2
and 3 close air support terminal attack controls, and perform autonomous
terminal guidance operations. Also called JFO. (USA, USAF, USSOCOM 14 Nov
05 MOA) [The intent of a JFO is to add joint warfighting capability, not circumvent
the need for qualified JTACs.] (AFDD 2-1.3) See also type 1, 2, and 3 terminal
control.

joint force air component commander. The commander within a unified
command, subordinate unified command, or joint task force responsible to the
establishing commander for making recommendations on the proper employment
of assigned, attached, and/or made available for tasking air forces; planning and
coordinating air operations; or accomplishing such operational missions as may
be assigned. The joint force air component commander is given the authority
necessary to accomplish missions and tasks assigned by the establishing
commander. Also called JFACC. (JP 1-02) [The joint air and space component
commander (JFACC) uses the joint air and space operations center to command
and control the integrated air and space effort to meet the joint force
commander’s objectives. This title emphasizes the Air Force position that air
power and space power together create effects that cannot be achieved through
air or space power alone.] [AFDD 2] {Words in brackets apply only to the Air
Force and are offered for clarity.}

joint force commander. A general term applied to a combatant commander,
subunified commander, or joint task force commander authorized to exercise
combatant command (command authority) or operational control over a joint


                                             98
force. Also called JFC. (JP 1-02)

joint terminal attack controller. A qualified (certified) Service member who,
from a forward position, directs the action of combat aircraft engaged in close air
support and other offensive air operations. A qualified and current joint terminal
attack controller will be recognized across the Department of Defense as capable
and authorized to perform terminal attack control. Also called JTAC. (JP 1-02)

kill box. A three-dimensional area reference that enables timely, effective
coordination and control and facilitates rapid attacks. (JP 1-02) [A generic term
for airspace control measures used by the theater air control system for
controlling air-to-ground operations. An active kill box signifies: 1) airspace
potentially occupied by attack aircraft, 2) underlying surface zone that contains
known or suspected enemy targets, 3) underlying surface zone known to be clear
of friendly forces. Kill boxes are complementary to, and do not preclude or
conflict with, other airspace control measures.] [AFDD 2-1.3] {Words in brackets
apply only to the Air Force and are offered for clarity.}

killer scout. Armed fighters or attack aircraft used for air interdiction, typically in
an armed reconnaissance role, to validate and mark targets for dedicated attack
missions against lucrative targets in a specified geographic zone. Killer Scouts
are normally used as part of the command and control interface to coordinate
multiple flights, identify or neutralize targets and enemy air defenses, and provide
battle damage assessment. (AFDD 2-1.3)

maneuver. 1. A movement to place ships, aircraft, or land forces in a position of
advantage over the enemy. 2. A tactical exercise carried out at sea, in the air, on
the ground, or on a map in imitation of war. 3. The operation of a ship, aircraft, or
vehicle, to cause it to perform desired movements. 4. Employment of forces in
the battlespace through movement in combination with fires to achieve a position
of advantage in respect to the enemy in order to accomplish the mission. (JP 1-
02)

mission type order. 1. Order issued to a lower unit that includes the
accomplishment of the total mission assigned to the higher headquarters. 2.
Order to a unit to perform a mission without specifying how it is to be
accomplished. (JP 1-02)

operational art. The employment of military forces to attain strategic and/or
operational objectives through the design, organization, integration, and conduct
of strategies, campaigns, major operations, and battles. Operational art
translates the joint force commander’s strategy into operational design and,
ultimately, tactical action, by integrating the key activities at all levels of war. (JP
1-02)

operational control. Command authority that may be exercised by commanders


                                              99
at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control
is inherent in combatant command (command authority) and may be delegated
within the command. When forces are transferred between combatant
commands, the command relationship the gaining commander will exercise (and
the losing commander will relinquish) over these forces must be specified by the
Secretary of Defense. Operational control is the authority to perform those
functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and
employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and
giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational
control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and
joint training necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the command.
Operational control should be exercised through the commanders of subordinate
organizations. Normally this authority is exercised through subordinate joint force
commanders and Service and/or functional component commanders.
Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and
forces and to employ those forces as the commander in operational control
considers necessary to accomplish assigned missions; it does not, in and of
itself, include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration,
discipline, internal organization, or unit training. Also called OPCON. (JP 1-02)

operational level of war. The level of war at which campaigns and major
operations are planned, conducted, and sustained to accomplish strategic
objectives within theaters or other operational areas. Activities at this level link
tactics and strategy by establishing operational objectives needed to accomplish
the strategic objectives, sequencing events to achieve the operational objectives,
initiating actions, and applying resources to bring about and sustain these
events. These activities imply a broader dimension of time or space than do
tactics; they ensure the logistic and administrative support of tactical forces, and
provide the means by which tactical successes are exploited to achieve strategic
objectives. See also strategic level of war; tactical level of war. (JP 1-02)

psychological operations. Planned operations to convey selected information
and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective
reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations,
groups, and individuals. The purpose of psychological operations is to induce or
reinforce foreign attitudes and behavior favorable to the originator’s objectives.
Also called PSYOP. (JP 1-02)

special operations. Operations conducted in hostile, denied, or politically
sensitive environments to achieve military, diplomatic, informational, and/or
economic objectives employing military capabilities for which there is no broad
conventional force requirement. These operations often require covert,
clandestine, or low visibility capabilities. Special operations are applicable across
the range of military operations. They can be conducted independently or in
conjunction with operations of conventional forces or other government agencies
and may include operations through, with, or by indigenous or surrogate forces.


                                            100
Special operations differ from conventional operations in degree of physical and
political risk, operational techniques, mode of employment, independence from
friendly support, and dependence on detailed operational intelligence and
indigenous assets. Also called SO. (JP 1-02)

special operations liaison element (SOLE). A special operations liaison team
provided by the joint force special operations component commander to the joint
force air component commander (if designated), or appropriate Service
component air command and control organization, to coordinate, deconflict, and
integrate special operations air, surface, and subsurface operations with
conventional air operations. (JP 1-02)

strategic level of war. The level of war at which a nation, often as a member of
a group of nations, determines national or multinational (alliance or coalition)
security objectives and guidance, and develops and uses national resources to
accomplish these objectives. Activities at this level establish national and
multinational military objectives; sequence initiatives; define limits and assess
risks for the use of military and other instruments of national power; develop
global plans or theater war plans to achieve these objectives; and provide military
forces and other capabilities in accordance with strategic plans. See also
operational level of war; tactical level of war. (JP 1-02)

support. 1. The action of a force that aids, protects, complements, or sustains
another force in accordance with a directive requiring such action. 2. A unit that
helps another unit in battle. 3. An element of a command that assists, protects, or
supplies other forces in combat. See also supported commander; supporting
commander. (JP 1-02)

supported commander. 1. The commander having primary responsibility for all
aspects of a task assigned by the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan or other joint
operation planning authority. In the context of joint operation planning, this term
refers to the commander who prepares operation plans or operation orders in
response to requirements of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 2. In the
context of a support command relationship, the commander who receives
assistance from another commander’s force or capabilities, and who is
responsible for ensuring that the supporting commander understands the
assistance required. See also support; supporting commander. (JP 1-02)

supporting commander. 1. A commander who provides augmentation forces or
other support to a supported commander or who develops a supporting plan.
Includes the designated combatant commands and Defense agencies as
appropriate. 2. In the context of a support command relationship, the commander
who aids, protects, complements, or sustains another commander’s force, and
who is responsible for providing the assistance required by the supported
commander. See also support; supported commander. (JP 1-02)



                                           101
synchronization. 1. The arrangement of military actions in time, space, and
purpose to produce maximum relative combat power at a decisive place and
time. 2. In the intelligence context, application of intelligence sources and
methods in concert with the operation plan. (JP 1-02)

tactical control. Command authority over assigned or attached forces or
commands, or military capability or forces made available for tasking, that is
limited to the detailed direction and control of movements or maneuvers within
the operational area necessary to accomplish missions or tasks assigned.
Tactical control is inherent in operational control. Tactical control may be
delegated to, and exercised at any level at or below the level of combatant
command. When forces are transferred between combatant commands, the
command relationship the gaining commander will exercise (and the losing
commander will relinquish) over these forces must be specified by the Secretary
of Defense. Tactical control provides sufficient authority for controlling and
directing the application of force or tactical use of combat support assets within
the assigned mission or task. Also called TACON. See also operational control.
(JP 1-02)

tactical level of war. The level of war at which battles and engagements are
planned and executed to accomplish military objectives assigned to tactical units
or task forces. Activities at this level focus on the ordered arrangement and
maneuver of combat elements in relation to each other and to the enemy to
achieve combat objectives. See also operational level of war; strategic level
of war. (JP 1-02)

terminal attack control. The authority to control the maneuver of and grant
weapons release clearance to attacking aircraft. (JP 1-02)

terminal attack controller. A qualified officer or enlisted member who, from a
forward ground or airborne position, provides terminal control to aircraft
performing close air support to ground forces. While terminal attack controllers
operate with the ground forces they support, their personnel normally remain
under the command of the component providing the close air support. Also called
TAC. (AFDD 2-1.3)

terminal control. 1. The authority to direct aircraft to maneuver into a position to
deliver ordnance, passengers, or cargo to a specific location or target. Terminal
control is a type of air control. 2. Any electronic, mechanical, or visual control
given to aircraft to facilitate target acquisition and resolution. (JP 1-02)

terminal guidance. 1. The guidance applied to a guided missile between
midcourse guidance and arrival in the vicinity of the target. 2. Electronic,
mechanical, visual, or other assistance given an aircraft pilot to facilitate arrival
at, operation within or over, landing upon, or departure from an air landing or
airdrop facility. 3. Any electronic, mechanical, voice or visual communication that


                                            102
provides approaching aircraft or weapons additional information regarding a
specific location or target. Terminal guidance is not a type of air control. Those
providing terminal guidance do not have weapons release authority, or authority
to direct the maneuver of aircraft. See also terminal control. (JP 1-02)

Type 1 control. Type 1 control is used when the JTAC must visually acquire the
attacking aircraft and the target for each attack. Analysis of attacking aircraft
geometry is required to reduce the risk of the attack affecting friendly forces. (JP
3-09.3)

Type 2 control. Type 2 control will be used when the JTAC requires control of
individual attacks but assesses that either visual acquisition of the attacking
aircraft or target at weapons release is not possible or when attacking aircraft are
not in a position to acquire the mark/target prior to weapons release/ launch. (JP
3-09.3)

Type 3 control. Type 3 control is used when the JTAC requires the ability to
provide clearance for multiple attacks within a single engagement subject to
specific attack restrictions. Type 3 control does not require the JTAC to visually
acquire the aircraft or the target; however, all targeting data must be coordinated
through the supported commander’s battle staff. (JP 3-09.3)
