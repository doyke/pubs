SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates provisions of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of
1990.

Section A—General Information

1. Glossary of References, Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Terms. See Attachment 1.

2. Background Information. The air transportation of hazardous cargo poses unique problems for mili-
tary operators. Routine flights that carry hazardous cargo take on a special significance considering the
possible repercussions of any mishap. Commanders, support agencies, and aircrews must ensure that the
policies and procedures of this instruction are strictly enforced.
2. (21SW) Colorado Springs Municipal Airport/Peterson AFB is authorized to handle up to and including
10,000 lbs NEW DoD Class/Div 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 explosives. Aircraft with hot secondary armament
are not authorized to land here, except in the case of an in-flight emergency. Peterson AFB does not have
storage capacity for DoD Class/Div 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4.

3. Cargo Classification. The Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Transportation
(DoT) hazard classification systems are consistent with the United Nations Recommendations on the
Transport of Dangerous Goods (Orange Book).

4. Technical Escorts and Couriers. Certain types of hazardous cargo require the presence of a technical
escort or courier during air shipment. The designated courier or technical escort is responsible for secu-
rity, safety, and custody of the cargo movement. This individual has complete jurisdiction over the cargo
concerning security safeguards, protection of personnel, and the repair or disposal of containers. The
escort is subordinate to the aircraft commander only in matters that pertain to flight safety and operations.

Section B—Procedures and Responsibilities

5. Command responsibilities. US Air Force major command (MAJCOM) commanders and US Army
major command (MACOM) commanders must establish procedures that ensure:
    5.1. Responsible unit personnel send a hazardous cargo advisory message to all affected en route,
    alternate (if known in advance), and destination stations for each mission that carries the following
    hazardous cargo:
        • Nuclear weapons cargo.
        • Toxic chemical ammunition and highly toxic substances.
        • Division 6.2, infectious substances (to include etiological and biological material) requiring
            technical escorts.
        • DoD hazard Division 1.1 through 1.3 explosives.
        • Inert devices.

     DoD Flight Information Publication (FLIP).
     5.2.8. As much advance notice as possible. Address US tenant units for bases not under US con-
     trol.
  5.3. Except for shipments of toxic chemical ammunition, highly toxic substances, Class 7 radioactive
  material, nuclear cargo, and Division 6.2, infectious substances, the Air Mobility Command (AMC)
  Military Airlift Interim Reporting System (MAIRS) departure messages prescribed by governing
  directives fulfill the notification requirements of this instruction if the information requested in para-
  graphs 5.2.1. through 5.2.5. above is in the message.
  5.4. Organizations that take part in daily flight operations that involve hazardous cargo (including
  ordnance-carrying training missions) do not require separate notification of departure or arrival if the
  standard operating procedures that apply are in effect at bases within their command. However, if
  these flights must divert to a base of another command or service, then paragraphs 7.7. through
  7.9.apply.
  5.4. (21SW) All organizations must coordinate NLT 24 hours before hazardous cargo movements.
  5.5. Appropriate personnel, knowledgeable in their specialty, periodically instruct crews in hazardous
  cargo notification and emergency procedures, including jettison criteria and limitations.
  5.6. Appropriate personnel, knowledgeable in their specialty, brief aircraft commanders and crews
  for each mission on the following:
     5.6.1. Special procedures and requirements for the hazardous cargo being airlifted.
4                                                      AFJ11-204_21SWSUP1_INT 12 MARCH 2002

       5.6.2. Operational mission requirements, including specific routes (if required).
    5.7. Installation commanders are aware that nuclear airlift missions require support second only to
    presidential and Joint Chiefs of Staff-directed missions as shown in AFR 76-38/AR 59-8, Department
    of Defense (DoD) Common User Airlift Transportation.

6. Installation Commanders. Installation commanders (or commanders of US tenant organizations at
bases not under US control) must develop plans that:
    6.1. Implement parent command directives regarding movement of hazardous cargo.
    6.2. Train base support elements in precautionary measures associated with shipping hazardous
    cargo, and meet the support requirements of aircraft carrying hazardous cargo.
    6.3. Provide priority support to aircraft carrying nuclear cargo. This must include priority air traffic
    and ground handling (at airfields under US military control, and (where feasible) at civilian or non-US
    military airfields, during arrival and departure), ground servicing and maintenance, security support,
    aircrew transportation, billeting, and messing. The commander must also provide an on-scene coordi-
    nator who:
        • Has the authority to resolve problems, set priorities, and direct employment of resources.
        • Has direct communication with the base command post.
        • Understands the mission sequence of events.
        • Anticipates and corrects problems before they adversely impact the mission.
        • Identifies himself or herself to the aircraft commander, courier, and local support element per-
            sonnel (security police, munitions, maintenance, transient alert, command post, etc.) as the
            on-scene coordinator.
        • Does not perform other functions during the operation.
        • Elevates appropriate problems to the installation commander.
        • Collects data and provides feedback to appropriate agencies to fine-tune the next operation
            and improve the written base plan.
    6.4. Establish a single point of contact for information and coordination of support efforts concerning
    nuclear weapons movements. This agency should be staffed 24 hours a day, be capable of contacting
    the coordinator and all other support agencies immediately, and possess (or have access to) an air or a
    ground radio capability. NOTE: Only those installations supporting nuclear logistics missions require
    that paragraphs 6.3. and 6.4. be incorporated in a written support plan. Installations required to handle
    an emergency or weather divert will comply with the intent of paragraphs 6.3. and 6.4.
    6.4. (21SW) 21 SW Wing Operations Center (DOC), is the Wing single point of contact.
    6.5. Establish checklists to pass hazardous cargo information from the base single point of contact to
    the coordinator and all affected base support agencies.
    6.5. (21SW) Base Operations, 21st Operations Support Squadron (21 OSS/OSA), accomplishes the
    hazardous cargo checklist upon receipt of the hazardous cargo advisory message, or in the event this
    message is not received, upon receipt of aircraft inbound notification.

    mander must obtain and provide documented evidence of the violation of procedures, including (but
    not limited to) tape transcript of controller's contact with the aircraft, depositions, and cargo manifests
    (Air Force: HQ USAF/XOO (Air Force Operations Center), HQs USAF/XOOT, or LGTT Wash DC;
    Army: CSA (Army Operations Center)).
    6.10. (21SW) If it is determined an aircraft landed without proper advance notice, Airfield Manage-
    ment obtains appropriate documentation and sends the information to the 21 SW/CC, 775 Loring Ave-
    nue, Ste 205, Peterson AFB CO 80914-1290, for appropriate action.
       6.10.1. (Added-21SW) 21st Security Forces Squadron notifies 21 SW/CP of any unannounced
       arrivals between 2200L-0600L, federal holidays and any other time Base Operations is closed.
       21 SW/CP, in-turn, notifies the 21 OSS/OSA standby representative.

7. Aircraft Commanders. Aircraft commanders must:
    7.1. Brief all crew members, couriers, and technical escorts on mission requirements, procedures
    governing hazardous cargo, notification requirements, and emergency procedures (including jetti-
    son).
    7.2. Enter "Hazardous Cargo," "Inert Devices" (or both), and the mission number and PPR number in
    the "Other information" or "Remarks" section of the flight plan unless prohibited by directives that
    govern the area of operation.
    7.3. Refuse to accept any clearance containing noise-abatement procedures that in the aircraft com-
    mander's judgment would interfere with flight safety.
    7.4. Designate a crew member (the navigator, if one is aboard) to record the coordinates, time,
    description, and location of abandoned or jettisoned cargo for later use by the proper authorities.
    7.5. Provide the information in paragraph 7.4. above to the designated courier or technical escort.
    7.6. Contact the base of intended landing at least 30 minutes before arrival to:
    7.6. (21SW) Base Operations notifies all agencies on the hazardous cargo checklist if ETA changes
    by more than 15 minutes.
       7.6.1. Announce that hazardous cargo is onboard.
       7.6.2. Verify base receipt of the hazardous cargo advisory message.

   7.8. Relay the hazardous cargo information to the proper Air Traffic Control Agency when declaring
   an emergency. In cases where the aircraft commander must choose between communications security
   and flight safety, safety comes first. The disclosure of classified information, if necessary to avoid
   endangering the flight, is authorized.
   7.9. Differentiate between hazardous cargo and inert devices when relaying hazardous cargo informa-
   tion. Make sure that agencies receiving hazardous cargo information are aware of the appearance and
   location of inert devices aboard the aircraft, even when the entire load includes inert devices.

Section C—Nuclear Cargo

8. Priority Support. Flights carrying nuclear cargo must be given priority support at all command lev-
els. The sensitivity of these missions makes it extremely important that both ground and air operations be
thoroughly coordinated and smoothly conducted.

9. Notification Requirements. Units that operate aircraft carrying nuclear cargo must comply with the
advance notification requirements of paragraph 5. (the advisory message must include line numbers from
DOE-DNA TP 20-11/Army TM 39-20-11/AFTO 11N-20-11). In addition, missions must not depart for a
station until the aircraft command has confirmed that the destination will provide the support requested in
the hazardous cargo advisory message.

10. Coordination by Base Central Point of Contact ( Paragraph 6.4.). After receiving a hazardous
cargo advisory message for aircraft transporting nuclear cargo, the base central point of contact must:
    • Notify the coordinator and all affected agencies and determine if support can be provided as
       requested.
    • Inform the unit that sent the message of any activities or restrictions that would adversely impact
       the mission.
    • If necessary, reschedule local activities to avoid conflict with nuclear airlift operations and ground
       convoys.
Installation commanders or their designated representatives must meet nuclear airlift missions and per-
sonally monitor the support provided. The designated representatives must have sufficient rank, knowl-
edge, and authority to affect a safe and efficient operation.
10. (21SW) 21 SW/CP notifies the following agencies as a minimum:
   10.1. (Added-21SW) Base Operations.
   10.2. (Added-21SW) Fire Department
   10.3. (Added-21SW) Safety
   10.4. (Added-21SW) Security Forces

11. US Air Force Special Weapons Overflight Guide (SWOG). Aircraft commanders (including com-
manders of tanker aircraft while air refueling nuclear-laden cargo aircraft) must comply with restrictions
and instructions published in the US Air Force SWOG to fly over foreign areas with nuclear cargo
onboard. Aircraft commanders must make sure that jettison coordinates are recorded and reported (Army
aircraft must not jettison nuclear weapons).

12. Nuclear Cargo Couriers. A courier (who must be a commissioned or warrant officer) must always
accompany nuclear cargo. Couriers must be armed and appointed on orders (or otherwise designated in
writing). Couriers must refuse to accept nuclear cargo without proper documentation (DOE-DNA TP
45-51/Army TM 39-45-51/AFTO 11N-45-51 and DOE-DNA TP 45-51C/Army TM 39-45-51C/AFTO
11N-45-51C) and must only accept nuclear cargo or inert devices that have been identified in the hazard-
ous cargo advisory message.

13. Nuclear Cargo Passengers. Do not allow passengers on nuclear airlift missions except when:
   • Required in direct support of contingency or emergency plans;
   • Designated as official couriers or technical escorts; or
   • Authorized by parent command mission directives (Permissive Action Link team transportation
      aboard nuclear airlift missions must be coordinated with the agency that provides airlift).

14. Nuclear Cargo Mishaps . Report accidents or significant incidents that involve nuclear cargo as
required by AFI 91-204, Investigating and Reporting Mishaps, (formerly AFR 127-4) or AR 50-5.
14. (21SW) The Wing Safety Office (21 SW/SE) is responsible for reporting accidents or incidents as
required by AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. 21 SW/DOC is responsible for reporting acci-
dents or incidents as required by AFMAN 10-206, Operational Reporting.

15. Two-Man Concept . Aircrew and ground support personnel must observe the procedures and
restrictions outlined in AFI 91-104, Nuclear Surety Tamper Control and Detection Programs, (formerly
AFR 122-4) or AR 385-40 regarding the Two-Man Concept when transporting nuclear cargo. MAJCOM
commanders must make sure that MAJCOM directives concerning transportation of nuclear cargo incor-
porate procedures for implementing and enforcing the Two-Man Concept.

Section D—Chemical Agents/Radioactive Cargo

16. Notification Requirements. When shipping toxic chemical ammunition and radioactive material
(Fissile Class III), consigning agencies are required to obtain cargo clearances according to AFJMAN
24-204/TM 38-250/NAVSUP PUB 505/MCO P4030.19F/DLAM 4145.3. Accomplish coordination and
clearance before the aircraft leaves. In addition, operating limits must comply with AFJMAN 24-204/TM
38-250/NAVSUP PUB 505/MCO P4030.19F/DLAM 4145.3.

17. Protective Measures:
    17.1. Toxic Chemical Ammunition. Consigning agencies must provide protective clothing and
    equipment to aircrews when shipping toxic chemical ammunition (unless supplied by the aircrew par-
    ent command). In addition, consigning agencies provide technical escorts and provide these escorts
    with protective clothing. Responsibilities of technical escorts are outlined in AR 740-32/MCD
    4030.25/AFR 136-4, Responsibilities for Technical Escorts of Dangerous Materials, and include:
        • Brief the crew and advise them of protective measures and required equipment.
        • Inspect the cargo periodically during the flight and inform the aircraft commander of any haz-
           ardous condition.
AFJ11-204_21SWSUP1_INT 12 MARCH 2002                                                                      9

       •   Control and neutralize leaking material and, subject to the aircraft commander's approval,
           accomplish emergency decontamination of the aircraft both in-flight and after landing.
   17.2. Hazardous Materials. Generally hazardous materials, except toxic chemical ammunition, do
   not require technical escorts. When technical escorts are required, the aircrew and all other personnel
   aboard the aircraft must have protective clothing comparable with those used by escorts. Aircraft
   Commanders will establish procedures to periodically inspect the cargo for damage and leakage.

18. Cargo Emergency. In a cargo emergency that involves chemical agents, all personnel onboard the
aircraft must don the protective equipment as quickly as possible. The aircrew will eliminate smoke and
fumes from the aircraft according to the applicable technical orders. If exposure to any of the hazardous
material is known or suspected, all aircraft personnel must report to the flight surgeon as soon as possible
after landing. To stop the hazardous material involved from spreading and to limit exposure to it, com-
plete personnel decontamination as close to the scene of exposure as possible. If available on station, a
flight surgeon should respond to the aircraft when it lands.

19. In-Flight Emergency. In determining the course of action to take during a potential or actual
in-flight emergency, the aircraft commander must:
   19.1. Consider the appropriate guidance provided by the Air Force Manual and the recommendations
   of the technical escort and the aircraft loadmaster, if one is assigned.
   19.2. If the emergency warrants, arrange to land at the nearest suitable airfield (preferably military).
   Use the notification procedures given in paragraph 7.6.3. Immediately after landing, the aircraft com-
   mander must:
       19.2.1. Contact the command post of the controlling MAJCOM or the proper Service command
       by the fastest possible means.
       19.2.2. Report location and provide all pertinent information regarding the emergency, including
       whether or not security was compromised.

NOTE:
If called for, the command post initiates an OPREP-3/Pinnacle or other appropriate notification to higher
headquarters.

20. Jettison Authorization:
   20.1. Toxic Chemical Ammunition:
       20.1.1. Jettison over land is not authorized.
       20.1.2. Only if authorized in the movement plan that accompanies the shipment. If authorized,
       jettison must be at least 12 nautical miles offshore in an open ocean area, preferably beyond the
       continental shelf. Record the geographic coordinates of the jettison location, but do not transmit
       the coordinates by nonsecure means.
   20.2. Other Poisons. Jettison poisons other than toxic chemical ammunition over land or water if
   essential to flight safety. However, jettisoning poisons over a congested area or water supply is pro-
   hibited. Report geographical coordinates of jettisoned poisons as soon as possible, so that the proper
   agency can maintain positive control over the area.
10                                                     AFJ11-204_21SWSUP1_INT 12 MARCH 2002

     20.3. Hazardous Materials in Reportable Quantities. Hazardous materials identified in Report-
     able Quantities (RQ) will follow jettison restrictions identified in Section D, paragraph 20.2. above.
     "RQ" preceding proper shipping name of Shippers Declaration for Dangerous Goods or on an air
     cargo manifest will identify these hazardous materials.

21. Passenger Limitation:
     21.1. Toxic Chemical Ammunition. Limit passengers to technical escorts, authorized inspectors,
     and mission essential ground personnel.
     21.2. Hazardous Materials. Observe restrictions in AFJMAN 24-204/TM 38-250/NAVSUP PUB
     505/MCO P4030.19F/DLAM 4145.3.

22. Buddy System. A single person is not given access to toxic chemical ammunition or areas that have
these munitions. Aircraft commanders must enforce this policy during flight.

Section E—Infectious Substances/Biological Materials

23. Notification Requirements. Units operating aircraft carrying Division 6.2 Infectious Substances
(Biological) cargo must comply with paragraph 5.

24. Degree of Hazard. There is no immediate in-flight hazard connected with biological research mate-
rials due to the incubation period involved. Plant quarantine materials are not directly dangerous to a per-
son.

25. Protective Measures. As a rule, a technical escort must be with each shipment of biological research
material. This is handled as stated in AR 740-32/MCO 4030.25/AFR 136-4, Responsibilities for Techni-
cal Escorts of Dangerous Materials.
     25.1. The technical escort must brief the aircrew and advise them of any requirements for protective
     equipment.
     25.2. The aircraft commander will insure required protective equipment is readily accessible to all
     personnel during flight.

26. Cargo Emergency. In a cargo emergency that involves biological research materials, all personnel
must don the prescribed protective masks (not necessary for plant quarantine material). Do not ventilate
the aircraft under the usual emergency procedures. Instead, the aircraft should remain aloft (if possible)
until the technical escort informs the aircraft commander that the cargo has been secured and the aircraft
decontaminated to the extent possible. If the leak is such that the technical escort cannot control or neu-
tralize it, the aircraft commander must land at the nearest suitable airfield (preferably military).

27. Jettison Authorization:
     27.1. Division 6.2 Infectious Substances (Etiologic Material). Not authorized if material requires
     technical escort during transportation.
     27.2. Plant Quarantine Material. Only over open water, at least 100 nautical miles from a major
     land mass with vegetation. NOTE: Technical escorts may authorize jettison of plant quarantine mate-
AFJ11-204_21SWSUP1_INT 12 MARCH 2002                                                                    11

  rial overland if the material is known to pose no threat to indigenous plants or crops and this action is
  essential to flight safety.

28. Passenger Limitation. Refer to AFJMAN 24-204/TM 38-250/NAVSUP PUB 505/MCO
P4030.19F/DLAM 4145.3.
