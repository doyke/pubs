8.15.2.7. Refer to 23 MXG 21-105 for Engineering Assistance Request.

8.16.3.4. (Added) QA will do a validation/verification to ensure personnel are capable of
performing the task without further training. If additional training is required, AFETS will train
personnel and annotate the training in their AF IMT 797 documenting their proficiency in that
specific TCTO task.

8.16.3.6.1. (Added) The QA TCTO monitor will advise the weight and balance section of receipt
of any TCTOs that can affect weight and balance.

8.16.3.6.2. (Added) When weight and balance-affected TCTOs are in work, the owning unit will
make an AFTO IMT 781A entry for weight and balance re-computation along with TCTO
completion documentation if not already loaded by PS&D.

8.17.5. (Added) Refer to 23 MXG OI 21-109 Source Reference Data Review Procedures for
guidelines for review of local work cards, job guides, page supplements, etc... .

8.18.4. (Added) Local OTIs. All proposed OTIs will be coordinated through the QA Chief
Inspector. The chief inspector will determine, based on information provided, if an OTI is
warranted. If it is determined that an OTI is required, an inspector assigned by the chief inspector
will be responsible for writing the OTI in the prescribed format. When 23 MXG/CC or appointed
representative, approves the OTI, PS&D will schedule a meeting of all affected agencies to
coordinate on scheduling and performing the OTI. Units will not begin accomplishment of the
OTI until after a meeting is held unless directed by 23 MXG/CC or appointed representative.

8.19.1. (Added) Designate in writing the OIC of the FCF program.

8.19.2.1. (Added) If required, develop additional checklists and procedures unique to the local
area.

pilots to include: a description of the full FCF aircraft profile, a comprehensive aircraft forms
review, a comprehensive IMDS review, applicable T.O. data requirements, and weight and
balance data (Form F).

8.19.2.2.1. (Added) (A-10 only) All upgrading FCF pilots will comply with the 23rd Fighter
Group FCF syllabus and use the FCF Upgrade Checklist in Attachment 22. A program entry
approval letter signed by the FG/CC will be accomplished prior to any upgrade training. Flight
hour requirements must be met.




                                                                                                  10
8.19.2.2.1.1. (Added) (A-10 only) Use the following minimum hourly criteria, including student
time, to designate pilots to perform FCF duties:
        A. 750 hours total and 200 hours first pilot PAA time.
        B. 650 hours total and 300 hours first pilot PAA time.
        C. 575 hours total and 400 hours first pilot PAA time.

8.19.2.2.1.2. (Added) (A-10 only) Upon completion of the syllabus, a letter of certification will
be forwarded for Operations Group/CC for signature. The original certification letter will be
kept on file with the FCF OIC and a copy at QA.

8.19.2.2.1.3 (Added) (A-10 only) FCF pilot currency is 180 days. To remain current, FCF pilots
can accomplish a full FCF profile in the Full Mission Trainer (FMT). Non-current FCF pilots do
not perform FCF duties until currency is achieved. To regain currency, FCF pilots will
accomplish an FCF in the FMT with a certified FCF pilot. If an FMT is not available, the FCF
pilot will fly an FCF profile accomplishing at a minimum the engine shutdown and manual
reversion portions of the checklist with a certified FCF pilot in chase.

8.19.2.2.2. (Added) (A-10 Only) In coordination with QA the FCF OIC will develop a written
examination for FCF pilots. The examination will be administered by Fighter Group
Standardization and evaluation(FGV)/Operations Group Standardization and evaluation (OGV)
and updated annually by the FCF OIC.

8.19.2.2.3. (Added) The FCF OIC will provide QA with signed individual certification letters for
all FCF qualified pilots.

8.19.2.2.4. (Added) Each squadron (if required) will normally maintain a minimum of three
qualified FCF pilots.

8.19.2.9. (Added) Analyze FCF results as provided by QA on a quarterly basis and submit
changes or recommendations (if any) in writing for improving local FCF procedures. Provide
the FCF OIC with any FCF trends, benchmarks, “Best Practices” and briefings.

8.19.3.6. (Added) Refer to 23 WG OI 21-121 for Functional Check Flight Program.

8.19.4.1 (Added)(A-10 Only) Configuration: Clean with gun system empty, no Pave Penny pod,
and five variable ballast plates installed. Fuel Load: Aircraft will have a full internal fuel load
for flight. The fuel load may be adjusted as mission requirements dictate with the specific
approval of the FG/CC.

8.19.4.2.1. (Added) A full FCF profile need not be performed if only certain systems were
compromised, or the aircraft is on a repeat flight. Subsequent FCFs of the same aircraft may be a
partial profile to include all checks not previously accomplished or to accomplish checks on a
failed item.




                                                                                                 11
8.19.4.2.1.1. (Added) (A-10 Only) T.O. 1A-10C-6 provides leeway to perform “Partial”

8.19.4.2.2.1.4. (Added) (A-10 Only) Under circumstances other than those listed above, the need
for an aircraft FCF following maintenance or repair work is an engineering decision to be
exercised by commanders through their maintenance officers. A specific profile will be tailored
to check the operation of the affected systems by the FCF pilot and approved by the FG/CC
before flight.

8.19.4.4 (Added) Weather Requirements. FCF flight weather minimums in this instruction are
more restrictive than those found in T.O. 1-1-300. The appropriate group/CC or designated
representative is the waiver authority for the weather restrictions found in this instruction.
However, the weather minimums established in AFI 11-202, Vol. 3, and T.O. 1-1-300 still apply.

8.19.4.4.1. (Added) (A-10 Only) If penetration of a ceiling is anticipated and a check of the
primary flight instruments is required, the weather minimums will be 3,000’/3nm to remain
VMC and allow for vectoring by ATC.

8.19.4.4.2. (Added) (A-10 Only) For check flights requiring manual reversion, flight control
checks, or engine re-starts, the working area will have a minimum of 8,000’ of clear airspace
before starting the checks.

8.19.4.4.3. (Added) (A-10 Only) Due to the potential for single engine or manual reversion
recovery the launch restriction for cross winds is 10 knots. This restriction may be waived by the
FG/CC.

8.19.4.4.4. (Added) (A-10 Only) Pilots will file an IFR flight plan and be under radar control to
the maximum extent possible.

8.19.4.4.5. (Added) (A-10 Only) In addition, all FCF pilots will monitor the Supervisor of
Flying’s (SOF) primary VHF from engine start to shutdown and will perform a radio check with
the SOF from the working area. It is recommended that the SOF be informed of the type of
profile planned (full or partial) and assistance required, if any.

8.19.4.4.6. (Added) (A-10 Only) Call signs used during FCFs will be specific to each squadron.
The 74 FS will use the call signs DYNO 41 - 45 and the 75 FS will use DYNO 51 - 55.

8.19.4.4.7. (Added) Pilots will debrief with squadron maintenance and QA. The flight control
checklist (attachment 16) completed during full-profile sorties or partial-profile sorties for flight
controls will be considered part of the forms “write-up” and given to maintenance if the aircraft
failed for flight control related problems.

8.20. Operational Check Flights (OCFs). May be flown by any pilot current and qualified in
the aircraft. If an item needs to be tested on an aircraft that is solely in the scope of the -6CL
(engine shutdowns, manual reversion, etc.), then a current and qualified FCF pilot will


                                                                                                     14
accomplish the check IAW guidance in the - 6CL. It is up to the discretion of the OG/CC,
MXG/CC, ECG/CC and SQ/CC in conjunction with the applicable flying squadron to determine
whether an OCF or FCF will be flown.

8.20.1. (Added) All OCFs require an active forms inspection by QA prior to flight. A printed
IMDS 380 screen will accompany the forms to ensure all grounding discrepancies have been
cleared in IMDS.

8.20.2. (Added) Following the active forms inspection, 23 MXG/MXQ will make a
recommendation to the 23 MXG/CC on whether or not a Preflight QVI should be performed on
the aircraft. Base this decision on the amount and scope of maintenance performed and length of
aircraft downtime, as well as the number and type of operational checks required during the
flight. Preflight QVIs will be the exception, not the standard practice.

8.20.3. (Added) The flying squadron providing the pilot for the OCF will schedule the
appropriate airspace and file all appropriate flight plans. NOTE: Keep OCFs to a minimum and
do not use to replace -6 FCF requirements.

8.20.4. (Added) If available, use an FCF pilot for all OCF flights. If an FCF pilot is not available
then a highly qualified and experienced pilot will be chosen.

8.20.5. (Added) (A-10 Only) Configuration: Clean with gun system empty, no Pave Penny pod,
and five variable ballast plates installed.

8.20.6. (Added) (A-10 Only) Fuel Load: Aircraft will have a full internal fuel load for flight.
The fuel load may be adjusted as mission requirements dictate with the specific approval of the
FG/CC.

8.22.3. (Added) High speed taxi checks will not normally be conducted at Moody AFB. High
speed taxi checks will be kept to a minimum and will require specific approval from the owning
Operations Group/CC.

8.22.4. (Added) (A-10 Only) A qualified FCF pilot will perform high speed taxi checks with
restrictions listed in T.O. 1A-10C-1(-2), T.O. 1A-10C-1-1, and T.O. 1A-10C-6CF-1(-2). The
required operational checks will determine the specific parameters to be achieved during the taxi
checks.

8.22.4.1. (Added) (A-10 Only) The aircraft will have a fuel load of 6000 lbs. (main tanks full).

8.22.4.2. (Added) (A-10 Only) If wheel brakes are applied above 100 KIAS or the pilot feels that
“hot brakes” may be possible, inform the SOF and apply local hot brake procedures.

8.22.5. (Added) (A-10 Only) Multiple tests should be avoided. If multiple tests are required, the
minimum wait time is 20 minutes or as specified in T.O. 1A-10C-1(-2) (Wheel Brake Energy
Charts) whichever is greater. This wait time will be spent with the wheels chocked, brakes
released for proper cooling. During the wait period the wheel/tire temperature will be monitored
for excessive heat buildup.

                                                                                                   15
8.22.6. (Added) (A-10 Only) The aircraft will be in the Functional Check Flight (FCF)
configuration.

8.22.7. (Added) (A-10 Only) Wheel brake energy charts will be consulted for the specific
profile(s) to be accomplished. The pilot will compute: (1) Wheel brake energy absorbed (speed
brakes OPEN and CLOSED) (2) Wait time for brake cooling.

8.22.8. (Added) (A-10 Only) The pilot will check the brakes IAW T.O. 1A-10C-6CF-1 (before
taxi checks).

8.22.9. (Added) (A-10 Only) A Supervisor of Flying (SOF) will be in the control tower.

8.22.10. (Added) (A-10 Only) Any deviations from these procedures due to operational
requirements will be approved by the FG/CC before taxi checks commence.

8.22.11. (Added) If it is determined that an A-10 will perform a high speed taxi check, the FCF
pilot will receive a brief from the FCF OIC and will perform the check while following
Attachment 18 (Added).

8.22.12. (Added) If it is determined that a C-130 will perform a high speed taxi check, the FCF
or OCF pilots performing the check will follow Attachment 19, High Speed Taxi Checks C-130.

8.23. (Added) Refer to 23 MXG OI 21-103 for Weight and Balance Procedures.

9.2. (Added) Refer to 23 MXG OI 21-127 for Impoundment Procedures.

                                                                                              16
11.27.3. (Added) Upon picking up the repaired item, the owning organization will follow up to
ensure TRNs are processed. This will be accomplished by reviewing the D04 daily.

11.27.4. (Added) If the item is not repaired and must be requisitioned, the TRN document will be
deleted. Once the back shop notifies the owning organization that a part cannot be repaired then
the owning organization should provide them with a supply document number as soon as
possible as to not hold up the shipping of the unserviceable asset. The reparable will be
processed through FSC and routed as a DIFM asset.

11.27.5. (Added) Normally, the owning organization/MX FLT will ensure there are no assets on
base prior to submitting a part for TRN action. However, there are certain situations when it is
prudent to use the TRN process in lieu of processing an Issue IAW TO 00-20-3 Para 3.4. This
will be determined locally by maintenance on a case by case basis.

11.27.6. (Added) IAW AFI 21-123, AFREP items require a supply document for processing. All
XF/XD assets taken to AFREP will use the MEMO MICAP document process and placed into
MASS with an ETIC. AFREP will provide the owning organization with an ETIC as soon as
possible but NLT 24hrs. All ETICs exceeding the 72 hour period will be considered for
requisition by the owning organization.

11.27.7. (Added) Off-Equipment Repair Agency Responsibilities:

11.27.7.1. (Added) Process all TRN actions in IMDS using screen # 352 or use SBSS screen #
180. TRN are only required to be processed in IMDS if maintenance action taken codes A, F, G,
K, L or Z apply. No further processing is required for all others.

11.27.7.2. (Added) All areas processing TRNs are required to maintain AF IMT 2521 and
process information IAW AFI 21-101, Para 11.27.

2. NOTE: Notes A thru F pertain to A/OA-10C Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU)
A. Removal, replacement, and adjustment of minor hardware (bushings, roll pins, bolts, nuts,
etc.) on these systems that do not affect the rig of the system are the responsibility of the crew
chief.
B. Seven-level structural maintenance technicians are responsible for determining the
serviceability of windscreen transparencies (pilot decision overrides that of maintenance when a
serviceability determination conflict exists).
C. R&R will assist in the preparation of the aircraft for the removal of all major components.
The AMU will prepare the aircraft when R&R workload causes excessive delays.
D. Removal and installation of springs to facilitate other maintenance is the responsibility of the
aircraft crew chief.
E. AMU maintenance personnel perform initial rig check of throttles by utilizing a Data Display
Unit (DDU). If throttles are found out of rig, R&R will accomplish the rig.
F. R&R is the only agency authorized to perform maintenance and/or ground operational
checkouts on aircraft installed flight control disconnections. R&R will be notified any time
disconnection must be disengaged or reengaged.

A-10 HIGH SPEED TAXI CHECKS                                                        Date__________



1. High speed taxi checks will not normally conducted at Moody AFB. IAW AFI 21-101
paragraph 8.22., high speed taxi checks will be kept to a minimum, and will require specific
approval from the owning Operations Group Commander.

2. If it is determined that an A-10 will perform a high speed taxi check, the FCF pilot will
receive a brief from the FCF OIC and will perform the check while following the guidance listed
below:

       a. Pilots will use the full available runway for all checks.

       b. Only a single acceleration and deceleration will be performed for each trip down the
       runway.

WARNING: DO NOT PERFORM THE CHECK WITH CROSSWINDS IN EXCESS OF 15
KNOTS.

               1. Accelerate to 90 knots.
               2. Pull throttles to IDLE.
               3. At approximately 90 knots, Anti-Skid System-Check
               4. Smoothly apply brakes until the anti-skid cycles, check for proper operation,
               then release.

NOTE: Use caution during the check. In the event of anti-skid failure, indicated to the pilot by a
      lack of anti-skid cycling, or a loss of directional control, it may be necessary to release
      the brakes, and actuate the emergency disconnect level (paddle switch) to regain
      directional control. Nose wheel steering may also be required.




                                                                                                  37

C-130 HIGH SPEED TAXI CHECKS                                                      Date__________



1. High speed taxi checks will not normally conducted at Moody AFB. IAW AFI 21-101
paragraph 8.22., high speed taxi checks will be kept to a minimum, and will require specific
approval from the owning Operations Group Commander.

2. If it is determined that a C-130 will perform a high speed taxi check, the FCF/OCF pilots
performing the check will follow the guidance listed below:

       a. Pilots will use the full available runway for all checks.

       b. Only a single acceleration and deceleration will be performed for each trip down the
       runway.

               1. Accelerate to 70 knots.
               2. Pull throttles to IDLE.
               3. Between 50 to 70 knots, smoothly and evenly apply full to-the-stop braking
               check for anti-skid operation.

NOTE: Anti-skid operation will be felt as a series of abrupt jerks in the aircraft deceleration
      caused by the anti-skid system cycling brake pressure on and off. This may or may not
      be felt in the brake pedals as bumps, depending on the brand of the brake metering
      valves that are installed. Blinking of the anti-skid lights (indicating braking system
      hydraulic pressure cycling) can be observed during the jerks.
