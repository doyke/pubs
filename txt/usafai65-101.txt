1. Cadet income and expenses.
     1.1. All cadets are on net pay and expected to manage their income and expenses. Purchases
     are normally pay-as-you-go with the exception of the fourth class cadets who are given an
     advance of pay on their pay record (not paid to the cadet directly) to cover their initial
USAFAI65-101 27 MARCH 2014                                                                      3


   expenses. These expenses include the cost of clothing, equipment, computer, computer
   maintenance, books, dry cleaning, laundry, linen, tailor, allied arts fee, athletic association
   fee, and any other items as identified in the cadet pay budget. Individual class budgets
   identify the estimated expenses associated with each class and are prepared annually to
   outline cadet income and expenses. (T-2). Cadets are entitled to monthly pay at a rate equal
   to 35 percent of the basic pay of a commissioned officer in a pay grade O-1 with less than
   two years of service IAW 37 United States Code (USC) 203(c). A foreign student receiving
   instruction under 10 USC 9344 is entitled to the pay, allowances, and emoluments of a cadet
   appointed from the United States, and from the same appropriations. For tax purposes, a
   foreign student has federal income tax withheld, however, there is no deduction for state tax
   or Social Security, i.e., Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and Medicare. (T-0).
   1.2. Annually, FMF cadet pay office requests inputs from organizations processing payroll
   deductions against cadet pay records. FMF consolidates those inputs into a proposed annual
   cadet budget, which is presented to the Cadet Pay Group (CPG). All supporting
   documentation for cadet payroll deduction changes, which are Non-Appropriated Fund
   (NAF) related, require a NAF accounting (NA) form 9, Evaluating Fees and Charges, to be
   submitted to Headquarters (HQ) USAFA Financial Management NAF oversight (HQ
   USAFA/FMN) office for review. After review by HQ USAFA/FMN, the request is
   forwarded to HQ USAFA/FMF for inclusion as a voting and/or agenda discussion item at the
   next CPG meeting. HQ USAFA/FMF furnishes minutes of the meeting to HQ USAFA/FM
   for review before forwarding to the USAFA Superintendent (HQ USAFA/CC) for approval.
   HQ USAFA/FMF provides the approved annual cadet budget to all cadets prior to transition
   week. All new payroll deductions, deduction increases or decreases, and/or removal of any
   payroll deductions approved by the CPG will take effect upon approval by HQ USAFA/CC.
   (T-1).
       1.2.1. The NA-9 is required when there is a change in deductions for barber, allied arts
       fee, athletic association fee, USAFA radio station, basic cadet training yearbook,
       graduation yearbook, and any other NAF related expense submitted for payroll
       deduction. (T-1).
       1.2.2. The NA-9 is not required for cadet personal deduction items that are not a NAF
       related expense. Examples are dry cleaning, laundry, linen, tailor, computer, software
       license, textbooks, diploma and clothing issue. However, inputs are required to be
       submitted for the above items annually before the beginning of February to develop the
       cadet budget for the upcoming class year. (T-1).
2. Cadet pay group. The CPG recommends and controls cadet expenditures by considering
such issues as cash allowances, cadet indebtedness, deductions, and charges. Cadet pay charges
shall be for required items necessary to successfully graduate, not for the convenience of an
organization. The CPG will convene a minimum of one time per year. A quorum (majority) of
those voting members identified in paragraph 2.1. must be in attendance to hold the meeting.
Once a quorum is established, a majority vote of those in attendance is sufficient for
recommended approval in the minutes to HQ USAFA/CC. In a situation where the vote is equal,
the vote will be decided based on the chairperson's vote. When a quorum is not met or at other
times as warranted, an e-mail vote may take place to complete an agenda item. Once a majority
of the voting members approve or disapprove an e-mail vote, follow-up voting action with non-
responsive members is not required. The voting members listed below may delegate an alternate
 4                                                            USAFAI65-101 27 MARCH 2014


from their appropriate office who may vote in the absence of the primary panel member at the
CPG or the e-mail vote. (T-1).
     2.1. Voting members:
        2.1.1. USAFA Commandant of Cadets, Vice Commander (USAFA/CWV) Chairperson

        2.1.8. Representative, Third Class Council
        2.1.9. Representative, Fourth Class Council
        2.1.10. Cadet Wing Commander (or designee)
     2.2. Nonvoting members:
        2.2.1. Chief Support Division (USAFA/CWTM)
        2.2.2. Resource     Management    Office     (RMO),   10th   Force   Support   Squadron
        (10 FSS/FSR)
        2.2.3. 10th Logistics Readiness Squadron (10 LRS/LGR)
3. Certification of cadet entitlements and deductions.
     3.1. HQ USAFA/FMF appoints, in writing, certifying officials responsible for certifying
     documents and vouchers originating in the finance office.
     3.2. Individual organizations submitting cadet payroll deductions to cadet pay must appoint
     their own certifying officials who prepare proper and timely cadet charges and maintain
     supporting documentation. The organization also provides cadet pay the appropriate input
     files for upload into the payroll system. (T-1).
     3.3. The annual cadet budget specifies all appropriate/authorized charges through a cadet’s
     pay record, except books and uniforms, which may vary from the budgeted cost. Any payroll
     deduction charge not included on the cadet budget requires approval by the CPG and HQ
     USAFA/CC before deductions take place. (T-1).
     3.4. Organizations processing variable deductions, such as uniforms and equipment, must
     submit them promptly and in the required format to HQ USAFA/FMF for processing through
     the Defense Joint Military Pay System. An organization may request, in writing, a fixed
     charge to affect an entire class(es) for a specific payroll month. Fixed monthly recurring
     charges for personal deductions are computer-generated and will process against cadet
     records until graduation, separation, or cancellation by the organization. (T-1).
        3.4.1. Clothing and Equipment. If a cadet is discharged before graduation while owing
        the United States for pay advanced for the purchase of required clothing and equipment,
USAFAI65-101 27 MARCH 2014                                                                     5


      he/she shall turn in so much of their clothing and equipment of a distinctive military
      nature as is necessary to repay the amount advanced. If the value of the clothing and
      equipment turned in does not cover the amount owed, the indebtedness shall be canceled
      IAW 10 USC 9350 and Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation
      (DoDFMR) volume 7A, chapter 38, paragraph 3805. (T-0).
4. Cadet oath and separation/travel entitlements.
   4.1. Upon taking the oath, cadets, by signing the oath, execute a power of attorney
   designating HQ USAFA/CC as their attorney and agent with full power to receive and
   disburse their cadet pay and allowances. (T-1).
      4.1.1. Applicants who refuse to take the oath after arrival at USAFA or were absent
      during in processing to take the oath, are not authorized travel entitlements to USAFA.
      HQ USAFA/FMF customer service shall initiate collection action on any government
      issued tickets for those applicants who do not take the oath. Additionally, these
      applicants are responsible for paying their own travel expenses home. Reference
      Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 1322.22, Service Academies, paragraph 4.3.8.
      (T-0).
      4.1.2. Rejected applicants who are not allowed to take the oath may be authorized travel
      entitlements. See Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR), Volume 1, Uniformed Service
      Members, current addition, chapter 7 and Comptroller General Decision B-179331,
      October 19, 1973. (T-0).
      4.1.3. Voluntary and involuntary separation and travel entitlements.
          4.1.3.1. Voluntary leave without pay. Cadets who decide to depart USAFA
          voluntarily after taking the oath are entitled to separation travel entitlements after
          receiving a separation order with an AF prefix. The AF order is the final
          disenrollment separation authorization with a fund cite for payment of travel
          expenses. Cadets who make a personal choice to depart USAFA before final
          approval of their disenrollment, travel on a prefix AC order which does not contain a
          fund cite. These cadets are traveling at their own expense until receipt of an AF
          order. Once the cadet receives the AF order, he/she may file for separation travel
          reimbursement IAW JFTR U5125.A.4. Also reference DoDD 1332.23, Service
          Academy Disenrollment. (T-0).
          4.1.3.2. Involuntary Leave Without Pay. IAW 10 USC 702, the Secretary concerned
          may place an academy cadet on involuntary leave for any period during which HQ
          USAFA/CC has suspended the cadet from duty at the Academy;
             4.1.3.2.1. pending separation from the Academy;
             4.1.3.2.2. pending return (administrative turn backs) to the Academy to repeat an
             academic semester or year; or
             4.1.3.2.3. for other good cause.
          4.1.3.3. A cadet placed on voluntary or involuntary leave under paragraph 4.1.3.1.
          and 4.1.3.2. are not entitled to any pay under section 37 USC 203 (c) for the period of
          the leave.
 6                                                             USAFAI65-101 27 MARCH 2014


            4.1.3.4. Return of an academy cadet to a pay status at the Academy from voluntary or
            involuntary leave status does not restore any pay or travel entitlements for the period
            of the leave. (T-0).
5. Cadet scholarships and/or educational investment funds.
     5.1. HQ USAFA/FM does not accept cadet scholarships containing restrictions. Restrictions
     are defined as any condition or limitation a scholarship agency places on the use of the funds.
     Some examples include “must be used for tuition, room and/or board,” “student is required to
     maintain a specific grade point average (GPA),” “scholarship funds will be paid back if cadet
     disenrolls,” etc. Cadet scholarships without restrictions or silent on restrictions will be
     accepted provided the check is payable to the U.S. Treasury. Scholarships accepted by HQ
     USAFA/FM are never refunded to the agency granting the scholarship, even if the cadet
     disenrolls. Ideally, scholarships should be made payable directly to the cadet; however,
     many agencies have rules against payments directly to students. (T-0).
     5.2. Educational investment funds (e.g., 529 plans) may not be accepted due to their federal
     and state tax restrictions and based on the specific plan may have other restrictions on how
     the funds are used. Normally a university financial aid office monitors these restrictions;
     however, a financial aid office does not exist at USAFA. USAFA does not charge for
     tuition, room, or board IAW 10 USC 4360 like other universities or have the authority to
     maintain separate billing and receiving accounts required to monitor the restrictions levied by
     law. The individual owner or administrator of the educational investment plan determines
     the valid use of the funds based on specific fund requirements and any state, federal, and/or
     Internal Revenue Service (IRS) restrictions. The owner/administrator shall consult their
     financial advisor, tax advisor, or legal advisor to ensure the specific fund rules are followed
     and if there are procedures for providing proceeds directly to the cadet. (T-0).
     5.3. Scholarship and/or educational investment proceeds returned to the originator will be
     accompanied with a letter explaining the above policy and contain an approximation of cadet
     income and expenses.
     5.4. The USAF Academy does not issue IRS Form 1098-T, Tuition Statement, because (1)
     USAFA is prohibited by law from charging tuition, (2) USAFA is not considered an eligible
     educational institution as we are ineligible to participate in the Department of Education’s
     student aid program, and (3) USAFA does not maintain a separate student financial account
     required by the IRS. Any tax consequence as a result of attending USAFA, receiving
     scholarship funds, and/or receiving educational investment plan proceeds are the
     responsibility of the cadet. (T-0).
6. Cadet basic allowance for subsistence (BAS). The authority for cadet BAS is covered in
the DoDFMR Volume 7A, Chapter 38 and DoDFMR Volume 12, Chapter 20. Effective October
2008 the BAS rate for cadets is equivalent to the enlisted BAS rate. (T-0).
     6.1. The following are four specific instances when cadets may receive BAS in their pay for
     periods of authorized leave or Temporary Duty (TDY). Normally cadets are not granted
     leave except for Thanksgiving, winter break, spring break, and one summer period IAW
     USAFAI 36-2014, Allocation of Cadet Time, paragraph 1.1.4.5. At all other times
     subsistence-in-kind is considered available unless otherwise determined by the HQ
     USAFA/FMF. (T-1).
USAFAI65-101 27 MARCH 2014                                                                   7


     6.1.1. BAS is payable for group leave periods when Mitchell Hall is closed, e.g.,
     Thanksgiving, winter break and spring break. The BAS entitlement is paid automatically
     by HQ USAFA/FMF based on the leave order received from the USAFA Cadet Wing
     designating the dates Mitchell Hall is closed. BAS is normally not payable for any
     periods before or after the dates Mitchell Hall is closed and will not be counted unless
     authorized under paragraphs 6.1.3. or 6.1.4. below. No action is required on the part of
     the cadet, Air Officer Commanding (AOC), or Academy Military Training
     Noncommissioned Officer (AMT). (T-1).
     6.1.2. BAS is payable while on official summer leave away from USAFA. The source
     document to receive BAS is the USAFA Form 118, Cadet Basic Allowance for
     Subsistence (BAS) Request. Cadets initiate this request, sign, and forward to their
     AOC/AMT for approval. The AOC/AMT submits the completed form encrypted to the
     usafa.fm@us.af.mil mailbox for processing by cadet pay. (T-1).
     6.1.3. BAS is payable for periods of TDY when cadets are required to pay for their
     meals. The source documents are the USAFA Form 118, the Defense Travel System
     (DTS) TDY order, and the DTS TDY settlement voucher. Cadets initiate the USAFA
     Form 118 and attach supporting TDY order and voucher. BAS is payable when
     government meals are not available or directed, partial (one or two) government meals
     are available and directed or all government meals are available and directed and the
     cadet was required to pay for the government meals. Cadets are entitled to BAS on travel
     days provided they are not traveling in a “members traveling together” status. BAS is not
     payable on any day when all meals are provided without charge, including travel days
     when traveling in a “members traveling together” status. Cadets who are TDY to an AF
     installation will have meals provided without charge unless the installation does not have
     a government dining facility IAW AFMAN 34-102, Directory of Government Quarters
     and Dining Facilities. For instructions on how cadets are treated as meal card holders at
     Air Force dining facilities, see USAFAI 65-103, Financial Management Policy, Figure
     A4.1. (T-1).
     6.1.4. BAS is payable for the dates of convalescent leave indicated on the AF Form 988,
     Leave Request/Authorization, provided the leave address is not on USAFA. A properly
     completed and signed AF Form 988 must be submitted by the Cadet’s AOC or AMT to
     cadet pay for processing. (T-1).
  6.2. The subsistence allowance earned by a cadet under paragraphs 6.1.1., 6.1.2., 6.1.3.,
  and/or 6.1.4. above will not be paid to Mitchell Hall. During summer operations, Air Force
  appropriated fund (APF) dining facilities provide meals to cadets without charge.
  HQ USAFA/FMF shall reimburse the Air Force Centrally Managed Allotment (CMA)
  appropriation based on the number of cadets performing summer operations TDY. The
  reimbursement will be the daily rate (applicable to the fiscal year IAW the DoD Comptroller
  published rate) times the number of days of TDY. HQ USAFA/FMF will credit the CMA
  appropriation 57*3500 32* C93B 48 562 525725 from the cadet CMA appropriation
  57*3500 32* P552 02 525700. This total amount will also be withheld from the payment to
  Mitchell Hall. HQ USAFA/FMF will process one Standard Form (SF) 1080, Voucher for
  Transfers between Appropriatoins and/or Funds, as a “no check drawn.” HQ USAFA/FMF
  informs the Chief, Air Force Food Services, Air Force Services Agency when the funding
  has been transferred. (T-1).
 8                                                            USAFAI65-101 27 MARCH 2014


7. Combat zone tax exclusion (CZTE), hardship duty pay-location (HDP-L), and imminent
danger pay (IDP) for cadets.
     7.1. Cadets are not entitled to incentive pay for hazardous duty or special pay for duty
     subject to hostile fire or imminent danger. Therefore, cadets serving in, or support of,
     combat zones or qualified hazardous duty areas are not eligible for income tax exclusion.
     Authority is the Secretary of the Air Force General Counsel memorandum dated 15 April
     2005 at attachment 2, figure A2.1. (T-0).
8. Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) for cadets.
     8.1. Cadets are not eligible to participate in TSP. 37 USC 211 allows members to participate
     in TSP IAW 5 USC 8440e. In 5 USC 8440e, members of the uniformed services may
     participate in TSP when "base pay" is payable under 37 USC 204. Cadets receive "base pay"
     under 37 USC 203 and therefore ineligible to participate in TSP. (T-0).
9. Cadets are only authorized allotments for charity and the association of graduates
(AOG) lifetime membership.
     9.1. The Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) and the Air Force Assistance Fund (AFAF) are
     the only authorized charity allotments for cadets. MyPay should be used for starting
     deductions for the CFC. (T-3).
     9.2. Cadet pay accepts the DD Form 2558, USAFA Overprint, Authorization to Start, Stop
     or Change an Allotment, to start, stop or change the allotment for the AOG lifetime
     membership at graduation program. This overprint allows electronic signature capability and
     the form may only be received from the cadet.
10. Foreign student program-tuition billing (applies to international students attending
USAFA for the full four years).
     10.1. U.S. Service Academies instruct foreign students on a reimbursable basis. Under 10
     USC 9344, the Secretary of Defense (SecDef) may approve country participation and may
     waive reimbursement, in whole or in part. SecDef’s waiver authority has been delegated to
     the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (OUSD(P)) in DoDD 1322.22.
     Annually by the end of June, the OUSD(P) publishes a listing of countries eligible to send
     students to the academies during the subsequent academic year, specifying reimbursement
     requirements. This listing is forwarded to the USAFA Admissions Office from OUSD(P)
     identifying the countries and whether the country has been granted a tuition waiver. (T-0).
     10.2. Annually by the end of May, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for
     Comptroller (OUSD(C)) establishes a tuition rate for the succeeding school year and
     publishes that rate to the Secretaries of the Military Departments, to the OUSD(P), and to the
     Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (OUSD(P&R)). This
     guidance is covered in paragraph 4.4.3. of DoDD 1322.22. The billing rate is established
     each academic year. The reimbursable rate is posted at Tab A of the OUSD(C) web site
     located at http://comptroller.defense.gov/financialmanagement/reports. The billing
     amount changes each year, however, the waiver granted a specific student applies for the
     entire four years. (T-0).
USAFAI65-101 27 MARCH 2014                                                                       9


   10.3. Annually after the new class has arrived, HQ USAFA/FMF will submit a
   memorandum to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)-INDY/JAXAA for
   collection action on foreign students. The memorandum will contain a list of the foreign
   students, their class year, their home country, waiver applicable (none or full) and the amount
   to be billed by DFAS to the home country of the international cadet. The memorandum will
   be supported with the waiver authority from OUSD(P) and the billing rate established by
   OUSD(C). (T-0).
   10.4. The appropriation used by DFAS for collection of the foreign student tuition is 57
   3210.9999, the Air Force Miscellaneous Receipts Account.
11. Cadet leave. Cadets do not earn leave IAW 10 USC 702(c). The normal leave accrual and
leave use provisions for active duty personnel under 10 USC sections 701, 703, 704, and
graduation leave do not apply to academy cadets. However, cadets are authorized a leave of
absence when approved under USAFAI 36-2014. (T-01).
12. Service credit. In computing length of service for any purpose, officers may not count
service performed while serving as a cadet IAW 10 USC 971. (T-0).
13. Student aid, educational tax benefits, and educational credits. USAFA is not eligible to
participate in the Department of Education Title IV programs and therefore does not receive Title
IV program funds. USAFA is an eligible school for deferment purposes only. Since USAFA is
not eligible to participate in a student aid program administered by the Department of Education,
it is not an eligible educational institution as defined in IRS Publication 970, Tax Benefits for
Education, and does not file any Form 1098-T. Because USAFA is not an eligible educational
institution, any education expenses a cadet may incur are not qualified education expenses for
the Hope, American Opportunity or Lifetime Learning Credits, the Tuition and Fees Deduction,
or distributions from education savings plans. (T-0).
14. Cost per graduate (CPG) and cost of education (CoE).
   14.1. The DODD 1332.23 establishes reimbursement policies for cadets failing to complete
   their required active duty period when called to active duty, and for those not called to active
   duty. Individuals failing to complete the required active duty period or who are ordered by
   the Secretary of the Military Department concerned to reimburse the United States under 10
   U.S.C. 2005 (reference (b)) ordinarily shall be required to reimburse the Government for
   education costs commensurate with time remaining on the active duty obligation when
   discharged. (T-0).
   14.2. The appropriation used for collection of USAFA CoE debts is 57 3210.9999, the Air
   Force Miscellaneous Receipts Account. This appropriation, not the USAFA/FM company
   code, is used for all USAFA cadets and graduates separating without serving their active duty
   service commitment. These CoE debts are exceptions to the rule of using a company code on
   miscellaneous debts. The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Financial Operations (SAF/FMP),
   Air Force Accounting and Finance Office (AFAFO), was the approval authority for this
   exception. (T-0).
       14.2.1. USAFA cadets separating may incur a CoE debt. HQ USAFA Judge Advocate
       (HQ USAFA/JA) works with HQ USAFA Financial Management Analysis (HQ
       USAFA/FMA) to determine the amount of the debt to be collected. HQ USAFA/JA,
       upon receipt of the separation approval documents, submits the CoE debt package to HQ
 10                                                        USAFAI65-101 27 MARCH 2014


      USAFA/FMF.          HQ USAFA/FMF completes a document transmittal and debt
      certification statement IAW DoDFMR, volume 5, chapter 29, and forwards the entire
      CoE debt package to DFAS, Indianapolis out-of-service debts. DFAS acknowledges
      receipt of the transmittal and initiates collection action. (T-0).
      14.2.2. USAFA graduates separating from active duty without serving the required
      active duty service commitment IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments
      (ADSC), will incur a CoE debt. The Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) computes the
      amount of the debt IAW AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, using their
      recoupment calculator, and prepares the DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization.
      The recoupment calculator requires the total cost for the four year CoE at USAFA. The
      four year CoE amount used in the recoupment calculator is based on the year the officer
      graduated from USAFA. This four year CoE amount is provided to AFPC by HQ
      USAFA/FMA. The appropriation specified in paragraph 14.2. above is used in the
      appropriation data block by AFPC when preparing the DD Form 139. AFPC sends a case
      management system (CMS) request, with the DD Form 139 attached, to DFAS,
      Indianapolis for posting and collection of the debt. DFAS should be posting these debts
      as a miscellaneous tuition assistance debt and collect all amounts received into an Air
      Force level line of accounting, not a USAFA company code. (T-0).
   14.3. Contact HQ USAFA/FMA for the CPG and CoE computation.
15. USAFA Preparatory School Students (HQ USAFA/PL)
   15.1. A student at the USAFA Preparatory School who was selected to attend the
   preparatory school from civilian life is entitled to monthly student pay at the same rate as
   provided for cadets IAW 37 USC 203(e)(1). (T-0).
   15.2. A student at the USAFA Preparatory School who at the time of the student’s selection
   to attend the preparatory school, was an enlisted member of the uniformed services shall
   receive monthly basic pay at the rate prescribed for the student’s pay grade and years of
   service as an enlisted member or at the rate provided for cadets and midshipmen under
   subsection 37 (c), whichever is greater. Reference 37 USC 203(e)(2). (T-0).
   15.3. A student at the USAFA Preparatory School who was a reservist, refer to 32 CFR
   903.5 Reserve Enlistment Procedures.
      15.3.1. Civilians admitted to the HQ USAFA/PL take the oath of enlistment on the date
      of their initial in-processing at the HQ USAFA/PL. Their effective date of enlistment is
      the date they take this oath. (T-0).
      15.3.2. Civilians who enlist for the purpose of attending the HQ USAFA/PL will be
      awarded the rank of E-1. These cadet candidates are entitled to the monthly student pay
      at the same rate as USAFA cadets according to United States Code Title 37, Section 203.
      (T-0).
USAFAI65-101 27 MARCH 2014                                                                 11


     15.3.3. The Office of General Counsel in a memorandum dated 9 February 2001,
     Subject: Pay of Service Academy Preparatory School Students, ruled the pay entitlement
     for a reserve member depends on whether the reservist, at the time of selection, has been
     serving in a active duty capacity for more than 30 days. Reference memorandum at
     attachment 3, figure A3.1. (T-0).
