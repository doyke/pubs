                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope and Purpose.
     1.1.1. This instruction provides guidance for developing and conducting training for unit
     Airfield Driving Program Managers (ADPMs) in order to provide safe ground vehicle
     operations and pedestrian control on the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) Skid
     Strip. Additionally, it outlines training requirements for all personnel (e.g. military, DoD
     civilians, contractors, etc.) that have a need to drive unescorted on the airfield.
     1.1.2. The 45th Operations Support Squadron (45 OSS) Airfield Operations (OSA) flight is
     the lead agency/Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for developing the Airfield for
     developing the Airfield Driving Program for the wing. In turn, 45 OSS/OSAM will train and
     certify unit Airfield Driving Program Managers (ADPMs), unit ADPMs train / certify
     personnel in their unit and those they are hosting.
     1.1.3. The standards set forth in this instruction are to control vehicles and personnel on the
     airfield. Only trained, qualified and certified personnel will be assigned duties requiring
     driving on the airfield. Certified personnel must be knowledgeable of and comply with the
     provisions outlined in this instruction.
     1.1.4. In today’s complex airfield environment, there are incidents involving aircraft,
     pedestrians, and ground vehicles at United States Air Force (USAF) airfields that lead to
     property damage and personnel injury. One of the most hazardous incidents for an airfield
     driver to be involved with is a runway incursion. A runway incursion is a major violation to
     the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-off of aircraft that has the
     potential to result in aircraft endangerment and loss of life. While there are several factors
     involved in a runway incursion, the leading causes of these incidents result from a failure to
     follow procedures, inadequate vehicle operator training, and loss of situational awareness.
     Therefore, strict adherence to the procedures in this instruction is essential to preventing
     aircraft vehicle mishaps and personnel injury on the airfield.
1.2. Authorization.
     1.2.1. Motor vehicle traffic on the airfield is restricted to Government Owned Vehicles
     (GOVs) and leased vehicles (e.g., Government Services Administration (GSA)) on official
     business. Airfield Management can authorize additional vendor, contractor, construction and
     Privately Owned Vehicles (POVs) as needed to support operations, but this will be kept to an
     absolute minimum.

                                          Chapter 5

        ENFORCEMENT, REPORTING AND VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

5.1. Enforcement.
   5.1.1. Airfield driving violations put ground personnel, aircrews and high value assets at
   risk. Unit commanders and ADPMs will be notified by the Airfield Manager or Assistant
   Airfield Manager in writing when airfield driving privileges are revoked. The following will
   be used as a baseline guide and is not intended to cover every possible violation / scenario.
   5.1.2. The AOF / CC, SE and Wing ADPM will work as a team to assign all runway
   incursions an operational category (i.e., Operational Error, Pilot Deviation and Vehicle /
   Pedestrian) defined in Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information for
   trend analysis. The AOF / CC will ensure these classifications are annotated in the
   recommendation section of AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report or the narrative section of AF
   IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report.
   5.1.3. The Wing ADPM is responsible for taking immediate actions to correct any identified
   systematic problems and ensuring interim control measures are applied until permanent
   corrections are made.
5.2. Runway Incursions / CMA Violations.
   5.2.1. Runway incursions are the most serious CMA violation and are the result of an
   unauthorized entry or erroneous occupation of a runway or other surface used for takeoff and
   landing of aircraft regardless of impact of aircraft safety. These incidents can be caused by
   aircraft, vehicles, pedestrians, or communication errors. Normally, incursions are caused by
   communication errors, lack of familiarity with an airfield, loss of situational awareness,
   distractions, etc. Runway incursions are further classified into three categories (Operational
   Error, Pilot Deviation, and Vehicle / Pedestrian). (See Attachment 1).
   5.2.2. The tower / ground controller will immediately notify airfield management of all
   runway incursions / CMA violations, who in turn will respond and escort the individual(s)
   off the airfield to complete a runway / CMA violation worksheet (See Attachment 7,
   CCAFS Skid Strip CMA / Airfield Violation Worksheet). NOTE: FAA Form 8020-25,
   Investigation of Vehicle or Pedestrian Deviation Report, may also be used (as required).
      5.2.2.1. The Airfield Manager or Assistant Airfield Manager will investigate the incident
      along with Safety and ATC personnel as necessary. Driver’s 483 will be confiscated /
      suspended by the Airfield Manager until investigation is completed. The unit
      commander and unit ADPM of the individual who committed a runway incursion will be
      notified that one of their unit personnel was involved in a CMAV and the incident is
      under investigation. This notification will be made within 24 hours or the next duty day
      of the alleged incident, whichever occurs first.
          5.2.2.1.1. The Wing ADPM and SE must inspect the unit airfield driving program of
          personnel that commit a runway incursion as part of the investigation. Emphasis will
          be placed on how the unit trained the individual and their compliance with this
          instruction.
 40                                                        45SWI13-207V2 21 AUGUST 2013


          5.2.2.1.2. Results of an investigation will be forwarded to 45 OSS / CC, through the
          AOF / CC, and to the violator’s commander. If driving privileges are suspended /
          revoked, the individual will be completely retrained to the standards contained in this
          instruction. A subsequent runway incursion in most cases will result in a permanent
          suspension / loss of airfield driving privileges.
       5.2.2.2. Runway incursions / CMA violations will be reported to Wing Safety IAW AFI
       91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports, Chapter 6.
       5.2.2.2.1. For incursions / violations that had an adverse impact on flight operations
       (arrivals, departures, etc.), an AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report will be
       submitted to the Wing Safety Office within 24 hours of the incident.
          5.2.2.2.2. For incursions / violations that did not impact flying operations, an AF
          IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report will be submitted to the Wing Safety Office within
          24 hours of the incident. NOTE: MAJCOM Airfield Operations division (A3) will
          be notified within 24 hours of any CMAV / HATR incident.
   5.2.3. The AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report or AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic
   Report will include the following information in the narrative section:
       5.2.3.1. Individual’s information (e.g., rank, job title, organization, TDY, base assigned,
       etc.).
       5.2.3.2. Individuals experience working on or near the airfield and date trained.
       5.2.3.3. If the individual was authorized on the airfield and / or CMA.
       5.2.3.4. If the individual completed all training required to operate a vehicle on the
       airfield.
       5.2.3.5. Approximate location where the CMAV occurred (e.g., runway / taxiway
       intersections, distance from thresholds, overruns, etc.).
   5.2.4. All incidents will be documented and briefed at quarterly Airfield Operations Board
   meetings. Units must provide specific information (who, what, when, where, how) for trend
   analysis, and documentation kept for the current and previous calendar year.
       5.2.4.1. Trends will be highlighted showing upward / downward incident rates (as
       applicable).
       5.2.4.2. Wing ADPM shall maintain a copy of all AF Forms 651/457, actions taken,
       results and supporting documentation IAW RDS. (AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and
       Reports, and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports. A copy of the
       final runway incursion AFSAS report may be obtained from Wing Safety and / or
       MAJCOM OPR for AO.
5.3. General Airfield Driving Violations.
   5.3.1. Personnel witnessing a general airfield driving infraction (e.g., speeding, not
   performing FOD checks, etc.) should immediately notify airfield management and give a
   brief description and location of the incident. Airfield management personnel will respond
   and escort the individual off the airfield and complete a violation worksheet (See
   Attachment 7, CCAFS Skid Strip CMA / Airfield Violation Worksheet).
45SWI13-207V2 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                      41


      5.3.1.1. Violations without an aircraft incident will result in refresher training with
      emphasis on areas concerning the violation. Subsequent and repeated violations may
      result in the loss of an individual’s AF IMT 483 and certification.
5.4. AF IMT 483 Suspension, Revocation, and Reinstatement.
   5.4.1. The Airfield Manager, Assistant Airfield Manager, unit commanders, unit ADPMs,
   SFS personnel and other designated representatives are authorized to temporarily suspend,
   confiscate and revoke an individual’s AF IMT 483 / airfield driving privileges from any
   individual violating the provisions of this instruction or performing unsafe acts on the airfield
   without--debate. NOTE: Unit commanders and ADPMs may confiscate, suspend and
   revoke airfield driving privileges for personnel assigned to their unit only.
      5.4.1.1. Suspension or revocation of a driver’s AF IMT 483 should be based on the
      severity and/or number of infractions committed by an individual (See Table 5.1.).
      NOTE: Recommendations for permanent revocation requires 45 OSS / CC review and
      concurrence.
      5.4.1.2. Any individual who has their AF IMT 483 revoked must accomplish all training
      criteria as an initial airfield driver prior to certification (excluding color vision testing).
      The individual’s unit commander (may not be delegated) will send a letter to the Airfield
      Manager requesting reinstatement of airfield driving privileges and include successful
      completion of all training IAW this instruction.

   RADIO COMMUNICATION, PHRASEOLOGY, DISCIPLINE AND TECHNIQUE

A2.1. General.
   A2.1.1. Radio communications are a critical link in the air traffic control system. The
   single, most important thought in communicating with air traffic control tower personnel is
   understanding. It is essential to acknowledge each radio transmission with controllers by
   using appropriate call-signs and terminology.
   A2.1.2. Brevity is also an important aspect in communicating with ATCT personnel.
   Controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly respond to vehicle
   operator and pedestrian requests. Conversely, vehicle operators and pedestrians must know
   what the controller expects from them.
   A2.1.3. Vehicle operators and pedestrians must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic
   control radio communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when
   operating on the runway and/or CMA. NOTE: Always monitor the appropriate radio
   frequency when operating on the runway or within the CMA.
   A2.1.4. Never assume anything.
   A2.1.5. Always ask for assistance if you have any doubt about whether to proceed.
   A2.1.6. If the instructions you receive from the tower controller are unclear, ask that they be
   repeated again by stating; - Say Again.
   A2.1.7. If there is anything about the controllers instructions you do not understand, ask for
   further explanations — do not assume.
   A2.1.8. Vehicle operators and pedestrians must give aircraft and ground control
   transmissions priority unless an emergency exists.
   A2.1.9. When the aerodrome is OPEN, the tower controller has ultimate authority over all
   traffic entering the runway / CMA and will issue specific instructions that approve /
   disapprove the movement of vehicles, equipment and personnel on the runway / CMA.
   A2.1.10. When the aerodrome is INACTIVE or CLOSED (i.e., no tower controller and no
   expected aircraft activity), airfield management is the approving authority for vehicle and
   pedestrian traffic on the airfield. NOTE: No activity on the runway / CMA is authorized
   without tower or airfield management authorization.
A2.2. Radio Technique.
   A2.2.1. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
   transmitter / radio will be ineffective and probably override / block out the other receiver,
   causing the other vehicle operator / pedestrian to repeat his or her call.
   A2.2.2. Think before keying the transmitter / radio, and know what to say before you need to
   say it.
   A2.2.3. The radio should be close to your lips, and after pressing the transmit button a slight
   pause may be necessary before you start speaking. Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
 50                                                         45SWI13-207V2 21 AUGUST 2013


   NOTE: The tower controller may have difficulty in hearing your requests if there is
   sufficient background noise (e.g., wind, chatter, etc.).
   A2.2.4. After releasing the transmit button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The
   controller may be looking for your location on the airfield, transmitting on a different
   frequency, or scanning the runway / CMA to enable your request.
   A2.2.5. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio and ground station
   equipment. Refer to the airfield diagram or this instruction to determine possible radio blind
   spots / dead zones.
   A2.2.6. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver / radio. Check the
   volume, frequency / channel, battery level and make sure the transmit button is not stuck in
   the transmit position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
   unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
   stuck / hot mike, and controllers may refer to it in this manner while attempting to correct the
   problem.
   A2.2.7. Vehicles operating on the runway / CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent
   radio mounted in the vehicle to communicate with tower controllers. A hand - held radio
   should only be used as a backup or when communication is required outside the vehicle.
   NOTE: Conduct an operational test of the radio before entering the airfield.
   A2.2.8. Air traffic controllers will not issue or use unconditional instructions (blanket
   approval) when authorizing vehicles to enter the runway for the purpose of airfield
   inspections / checks or any other operation.
   A2.2.9. The tower controller will instruct vehicle operators and pedestrians requiring access
   on the runway / CMA on the Tower Net or – B Net.
A2.3. Phraseology.
   A2.3.1. Vehicle operators and pedestrians must contact the tower controller each and every
   time they proceed onto or leave the runway / CMA. When proceeding onto the CMA, you
   must advise the controller of three critical pieces of information: WHO you are (call sign),
   WHERE you are and WHAT your intentions are. Operators must always acknowledge all
   communications so the tower / ground controller knows that the message was received.
Table A2.1. Sample Runway Access Phraseology
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                          “CAPE TOWER, SWEEPER1”
TOWER / GROUND CONTROLLER:                 “SWEEPER1, CAPE TOWER”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                          “CAPE TOWER, SWEEPER1 REQUESTS
                                           ACCESS ONTO RUNWAY 13 FROM
                                           TAXIWAY ALPHA”
TOWER / GROUND CONTROLLER:                 “SWEEPER1, PROCEED ONTO RUNWAY
                                           13 AND ADVISE WHEN OFF”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                          “SWEEPER1, UNDERSTAND,
                                           PROCEEDING ONTO RUNWAY 13, WILL
                                           ADVISE WHEN OFF”
NOTE: When entering the runway / CMA, visually scan the area prior to entering, and then
proceed as directed.
45SWI13-207V2 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                  51


   A2.3.2. Conversely, the tower controller may not always approve a request, depending on
   aircraft traffic or other activity. For example:

Table A2.2. Sample Hold Short Instructions
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                                “CAPE TOWER, LIGHTING1”
TOWER / GROUND CONTROLLER:                       “LIGHTING1, CAPE TOWER”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                                “CAPE TOWER, LIGHTING1 REQUESTS
                                                 ACCESS ONTO RUNWAY 31 FROM
                                                 TAXIWAY BRAVO”
TOWER / GROUND CONTROLLER:                       “LIGHTING1, CAPE TOWER HOLD
                                                 SHORT OF TUNWAY 31”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                                “CAPE TOWER, LIGHTING1
                                                 UNDERSTAND HOLD SHORT OF
                                                 RUNWAY 31.”
NOTE: There is no need to repeat the request. When the tower / ground controller is available
to communicate with you again, he / she will contact you. Continuing with the above example:

Table A2.3. Sample Read Back Instructions
TOWER / GROUND CONTROLLER:                       “LIGHTING1, CAPE TOWER”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                                “CAPE TOWER, LIGHTING1”
TOWER / GROUND CONTROLLER:                       “LIGHTING1, CAPE TOWER PROCEED
                                                 ONTO RUNWAY 31 AND ADVISE WHEN
                                                 OFF”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                                “CAPE TOWER, LIGHTING1
                                                 UNDERSTAND APPROVED ON RUNWAY
                                                 31, WILL ADVISE WHEN OFF.”
   A2.3.3. ALWAYS read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time
   for correction if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if
   you do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat it. Good
   communication only occurs when each party knows and understands what the other is saying.
   A2.3.4. Use extreme caution when you hear the phrase - Go Ahead. Tower / ground
   controllers use this to mean – state your request. It NEVER means to proceed.
   A2.3.5. Do Not use the word – clear or – cleared or other variation when reporting on / off
   the runway or CMA. This word is reserved for pilots and air traffic controllers only.
   EXCEPTION: Vehicle operators and pedestrians may reply – loud and clear in response to
   tower controller requests for radio transmission quality or clarity.
   A2.3.6. Never use Citizens Band (CB) lingo, law enforcement – ten codes or personnel
   names while operating on the airfield. For example, - “Good Buddy”, - “10 – 4” and –
   “Jim” are not authorized terms.
 52                                                      45SWI13-207V2 21 AUGUST 2013


Table A2.4. Common Use Phrases.




A2.4. Aviation Alphabet.
   A2.4.1. Because some letters have similar sounds (e.g., B and P), the international aviation
   community uses the following words to reduce and avoid confusion. For example, Taxiway

                              VEHICLE CALL SIGN LISTING

A23.1. Vehicle / Pedestrian Call Signs. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians operating on the
runway/CMA must use a distinct call sign coordinated by the Wing ADPM to avoid duplicating
and confusing names. Call signs will consist of a code word and may have a numerical suffix
attached. NOTE: Do not use a call sign that is also a part of air traffic control phraseology such
as ―Taxi. The following callsigns are routinely used at CCAFS
