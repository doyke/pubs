                    FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IN THE AIR FORCE

1.1. Overview. Financial management is the process of determining requirements, obtaining
resources, and effectively and efficiently applying those resources to meet the Air Force's direct
mission and support responsibilities. Commanders are responsible for this process.
1.2. Applying This Instruction. All activities that prepare, justify, and execute Air Force
appropriations, including Air Force business areas of the Defense Working Capital Fund, must
follow this guidance.
1.3. Responsibilities. See following chapters for specific responsibilities.
   1.3.1. The Deputy Assistant Secretary, Budget (SAF/FMB):
       1.3.1.1. Establishes Air Force budget policies and procedures for preparing, justifying,
       and executing budgets.
       1.3.1.2. Provides guidance on organizational and appropriation funding responsibilities
       and use of funds (propriety) issues.
       1.3.1.3. Develops and maintains the budget structure and associated codes.
   1.3.2. MAJCOMs, Field Operating Agencies (FOA), and Direct Reporting Units (DRU)
   program managers and installations will program, budget and administer appropriated funds
   according to the guidance and procedures in this instruction.
1.4. Related Guidance. See related guidance in DoD Regulation 7000.14-R, Department of
Defense Financial Management Regulation; volume 2 of this AFI, Budget Management for
Operations; and AFMAN 65-604, Appropriation Symbols and Budget Codes. Follow AFI 65-106
for appropriated fund support of Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) programs. See
financial regulations of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Denver Center, (DFAS-
DE) for related accounting guidance.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                 23


                                            Chapter 2

     WARRANTS, APPORTIONMENTS, TRANSFERS, AND REPROGRAMMING

2.1. Overview. The Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Treasury
Department, and USD(C) must take certain actions before the Air Force can legally obligate and
expend appropriated funds. An appropriation bill becomes law (is enacted) when the President
signs it, or when the Congress passes it over the President's veto (unless the bill gives a different
effective date). After the Congress enacts an appropriation, the Treasury issues an appropriation
warrant and OMB apportions the appropriation. Title 31 U.S.C., Section 15l2a contains
apportionment criteria.
2.2. Responsibilities:
   2.2.1. SAF/FMB requests apportionment from the DoD Comptroller.
   2.2.2. When the Department of Defense (DoD) operates under a continuing resolution
   authority (CRA), SAF/FMB must request temporary appropriation warrants from the
   Treasury Department for amounts needed during the period of the CRA. SAF/FMB will issue
   funding documents to MAJCOMs and other Air Force field activities after the Treasury
   issues temporary appropriation warrants and OMB approves apportionment requests. The
   Treasury will issue regular appropriation warrants when Congress enacts the actual
   appropriation bill.
   2.2.3. If the Congress hasn't enacted the DoD appropriation act and hasn't passed a CRA,
   SAF/FMB will provide guidance on how to operate without funding authorization. Usually,
   federal agencies cannot initiate new program starts under continuing resolutions.
   2.2.4. The transfer of funds between appropriations resulting from Congressionally directed
   transfers or reprogramming actions are accomplished by SAF/FMB using SF Form 1151,
   Nonexpenditure Transfer Authorization, processed through and validated by the Treasury
   Department. SAF/FMB can make transfers only with legal authority, e.g., Congressionally
   directed transfers in appropriation language, or specific Congressional direction/approval,
   e.g. reprogrammings.
2.3. Reprogrammings:
   2.3.1. Reprogramming involves realigning funds from one purpose (or program) to another.
   Within DoD, reprogramming includes transferring funds between appropriations and moving
   funds between programs in the same appropriation.
   2.3.2. The Congress authorizes and appropriates funds for programs that are either stated in
   statutory language or discussed in the committee reports that accompany authorization and
   appropriation acts. However, Congress recognizes unforeseen requirements occur during the
   execution phase of a budget and, therefore, permits reprogramming of funds in execution
   within certain guidelines, which are subject to annual Congressional guidance. Both statutory
   and regulatory rules govern reprogramming.
   2.3.3. Follow these rules:
       2.3.3.1. The Congress must provide prior approval of a reprogramming if it:
24                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


        2.3.3.1.1. Transfers funds between appropriation accounts or working capital funds
        that involve the use of transfer authority.
        2.3.3.1.2. Affects an item known to be of special interest to one or more
        Congressional oversight committees unless specific Congressional language allows
        for additional quantities to be procured within appropriated funds. Increases resulting
        from such language require an internal reprogramming action to the OUSD(C).
        2.3.3.1.3. Increases the quantity of a procurement line item that is authorized by
        Congress in quantity terms.
     2.3.3.2. DoD must request Congressional          approval before implementing any
     reprogramming that involves:
        2.3.3.2.1. MILPERS: a cumulative increase of $10 million or more in a budget
        activity (as shown on the DD 1414).
        2.3.3.2.2. Operation and Maintenance: a cumulative increase of $15 million or
        more in a budget activity (as shown on DD 1414).
        2.3.3.2.3. Procurement (for any program year) (3010, 3011, 3020, 3080):
           2.3.3.2.3.1. A cumulative increase of $20 million or more in a procurement line
           item.
           2.3.3.2.3.2. The addition of a procurement program, subprogram, or major
           modification costing $20 million or more within the first 3 years. For safety
           programs and safety modifications costing less than $20 million see paragraph
           2.4.1.4.1.
           2.3.3.2.3.3. A cumulative decrease of more than $20 million, or 20 percent of the
           appropriated amount (inclusive of supplemental appropriations and rescissions),
           whichever is less.
           2.3.3.2.3.4. The termination of any program which results in the elimination of a
           procurement program, subprogram, or modification $20 million or greater within
           a procurement program.
           2.3.3.2.3.5. A notification letter to the Congressional Committees is required in
           advance of initiating a new start program, including modifications, costing less
           than $20 million for the entire effort.
           2.3.3.2.3.6. Terminations of programs falling within the amounts normally
           allowed by ―below threshold‖ reprogramming require notification by letter to
           Congress prior to any reprogramming. Letters for new start programs or program
           termination shall be signed by the notifying Component, after coordination of the
           OUSD (C).
        2.3.3.2.4. RDT&E (for any program year):
           2.3.3.2.4.1. A cumulative increase of $10 million or more in an existing program
           element.
           2.3.3.2.4.2. The initiation of a new program, project, or subproject of $10 million
           or more in the first three years.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            25


             2.3.3.2.4.3. A cumulative decrease of more than $10 million or 20 percent of the
             appropriated amount (inclusive of supplemental appropriations and rescissions),
             whichever is less.
             2.3.3.2.4.4. A notification letter to the Congressional Committees is required in
             advance of initiating the program for a new start program less than $10 million for
             the entire effort.
             2.3.3.2.4.5. Terminations of programs falling within the amounts normally
             allowed by ―below threshold‖ reprogramming require notification by letter to
             Congress prior to any reprogramming.
             2.3.3.2.4.6. Letters for new start programs or program termination shall be signed
             by the notifying component, after coordination of the OUSD (C).
      2.3.3.3. The programs or items for which DoD requests funds must have a higher priority
      than those for which Congress originally appropriated the funds.
      2.3.3.4. DoD components can't reprogram funds for an item or program denied or
      reduced by the Congress, unless there is positive indication that the Congress reduced
      funds for a program "without prejudice." The phrase "without prejudice" means that the
      Congress permits the increase in funding within the limits in subparagraph 2.3.3.2.
   2.3.4. See Chapter 6 for guidance on withinscope contract changes and upward obligations
   for canceled accounts.
   2.3.5. See Chapter 18 for Reprogramming in Defense Working Capital Fund Business
   Areas.
   2.3.6. See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Vol. 3, Chapter 6 for further details.
2.4. Congressional New Start Notification Procedures.
   2.4.1. Congressional new start notification procedures are delineated in DoD FMR 7000.14-
   R, Vol. 3, Chapter 6. General guidance applies to Special Access Programs. Specific
   procedures are provided through SAF/FMBMB and SAF/AQL.
      2.4.1.1. New Start: A program, subprogram, modification, project or subproject,
      regardless of amount, not previously justified to and appropriated by Congress in a given
      appropriation through the normal budget process is considered to be a new start. This
      includes any effort that is not described in the Research, Development, Test and
      Evaluation (RDT&E) Descriptive Summaries or Procurement Justification Books
      accompanying the President’s Budget (PB). Budget justification documentation
      submitted to Congress can be found on the SAF/FM web site at
      http://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/. For purposes of this paragraph, the following definitions
      apply.
      2.4.1.2. Program.
          2.4.1.2.1. For investment accounts, the aggregate level of budget line items as
          identified in the President’s Budget P-1 and R-1 justification documents and related
          classified annexes and reports as subsequently modified by Congressional action.
26                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


        2.4.1.2.2. For O&M and Military Personnel accounts, new starts would be
        significant new programs that have not been explicitly justified to Congress in budget
        justification material. Refer to the subactivity group on the O-1 for the program level
        identification and the detailed narrative justification for specific activities.
     2.4.1.3. Sub-Program/Project/Sub-Project: The most specific level of budgeted items
     identified in the President's Budget justification documents and related classified
     annexes. These sub-programs, project, and sub-projects are shown as separate efforts
     below the P-1/R-1 line.
        2.4.1.3.1. For RDT&E refer to R-2A budget exhibits by fiscal year. The Budget
        Program Activity Code (BPAC) may also indicate the level of detail that should be
        reviewed.
        2.4.1.3.2. For Aircraft and Missile Procurement refer to P-40 narrative and
        supporting exhibits such as P-3As and P-1900s.
        2.4.1.3.3. Note that the RDT&E BPAC and/or Procurement Material Program Code
        (MPC)/ Mod number may exist and have funds in the year of the effort under
        consideration; however, if this new effort is not included in the justification narrative,
        a new start notification is still required.
     2.4.1.4. Modifications: Modifications are the alteration, conversion, modernization, or
     major service life extension of an end item of investment equipment which changes or
     improves either the original purpose or operational capacity in relation to effectiveness,
     efficiency, reliability or safety of that item. P-1 line items are considered programs, and
     modification number identified on the P-3 report would be the sub-program or project.
        2.4.1.4.1. All modifications, regardless of amount, not previously justified and
        appropriated by Congress require Congressional notification before obligations can
        occur. However, safety modifications and safety programs costing less than $20
        million for the entire effort can be initiated in advance of the Congressional
        notification.
        2.4.1.4.2. Safety Modification. A modification that corrects a material deficiency
        which caused a Class A Mishap (per AFI 91-204), as determined by the AFSC
        Memorandum of Final Evaluation, shall be classified a safety modification. Other
        modifications may be classified as a safety modification as described in AFI 63-1101,
        paragraph 1.2.2.
        2.4.1.4.3. Low cost Modification (Mod #9999X): Individual modifications funded in
        the Low Cost Modification line generally satisfy an unforeseen requirement estimated
        to complete within one year. Total funding for efforts on the Low cost Mod line for
        each fiscal year should not exceed $2.0M per year. Any effort not consistent with the
        Low Cost Mod line budget documentation or efforts exceeding the $2.0M dollar
        threshold are not considered ―low cost‖ and must be documented on a separate P3A
        and are subject to new start guidelines.
        2.4.1.4.4. Service Bulletin. Service bulletins are airworthiness directives issued by
        the FAA or the weapon system manufacturer. These modifications are required to
        keep the weapon system in compliance with FAA standards and to maintain FAA
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                          27


          certification. Modifications as a result of FAA service bulletins are considered new
          starts if they occur during execution years and are not consistent with the Service
          Bulletin modification line budget documentation.
      2.4.1.5. Commodities: Some P-1 budget activities include line items that represent
      categories of commodities that are procured by other than AFMC System Program
      Offices (SPOs). These activities are executed in accordance with Air Force annual
      priorities and do not represent new efforts with follow-on costs. New Start notification
      procedures do not apply to the following unless it results in a new program or P-1 line
      item.
          2.4.1.5.1. Aircraft Procurement: BP12, Common Support Equipment; BP14,
          Industrial Responsiveness; BP16, Initial Spares; and BP17, War Consumables.
          2.4.1.5.2. Missile Procurement: BP22, Missile Replacement Equipment; BP 25,
          Industrial Responsiveness; BP 24, Replenishment Spares; BP26, Initial Spares.
          2.4.1.5.3. Other Procurement: BP82, Vehicular Equipment; BP 83, Electronics and
          Telecommunications Equipment; BP84, Other Base Maintenance and Support
          Equipment; BP86, Spare and Repair Parts. Commodities comprise the preponderance
          of items funded with the Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF) appropriation and are
          procured by organizations other than AFMC System Program Offices (SPOs). New
          starts will seldom (if ever) arise for these commodity-type items. However, SPOs
          overseeing OPAF system acquisition programs may have qualifying new start efforts
          and must comply with the guidance set forth herein. Reference web site
          http://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/FMB/FMBI/newstarts/newstarts.shtml that identifies
          the programs within OPAF that must comply with this new start guidance.
          2.4.1.5.4. Procurement of Ammunition: BP35, Munitions & Related Equipment.
          Commodities comprise the preponderance of items funded with the Procurement of
          Ammunition Air Force (PAAF) appropriation and are procured by Air Logistics
          Center item managers. New starts will seldom (if ever) arise for these commodity-
          type items. However, SPOs overseeing PAAF system acquisition programs may have
          qualifying new start efforts and must comply with the guidance herein. Reference
          web     site   http://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/FMB/FMBI/newstarts/newstarts.shtml
          which identifies the programs within PAAF that must comply with this new start
          guidance.
   2.4.2. Refer to AFI 63-101, Acquisition Systems, and AFI 23-205, Managing the
   Procurement Material Programs, for additional guidance. System Program Director and
   Program Control Chief certification is required in accordance with AFI 63-101, paragraph
   1.3.3.3.
2.5. Deferrals and Rescissions. Initiate deferral actions only with SAF approval. Forward
requests for deferrals through MAJCOMs/FOAs to SAF/FMB for review and approval. See
Attachment 4 for specific DoD Comptroller guidance on using deferrals and rescissions.

                                          Chapter 3

         BUDGET AUTHORIZATION, ALLOCATIONS, AND ALLOTMENTS

3.1. Administering Budget Authority Documents:
   3.1.1. This chapter explains procedures for using budget authorizations, allocations,
   suballocations, allotments, and suballotments for appropriations that aren't administered
   under the accounting system for operations. AFI 65-601, volume 2, explains how to use the
   operating budget authority document (OBAD) for appropriations administered under the
   accounting system for operations.
   3.1.2. The Air Force goal is to provide optimum fund flexibility at all levels. Therefore, Air
   Force funds issuing activities will:
      3.1.2.1. Issue budget authorizations and other management type authorizations at the
      highest practical level within an appropriation, consistent with the requirements of
      management and limitations imposed by the executive and legislative branches of the
      federal government.
      3.1.2.2. Issue allocations and allotments (including suballocations and suballotments) at
      the appropriation level at all echelons except as indicated in paragraph 3.6.
      3.1.2.3. Include limitations on funds use required by law and limitations on funds use
      required by the legislative and executive branches of the federal government and the
      Department of the Air Force on allocation documents. Limitations subject to Title 31
      U.S.C. (and DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 14) must apply to total availability or total obligations
      for specific purposes. Clearly identify each specific limitation in the "Limitations"
      portion of the allocation document.
   3.1.3. Operating agencies that receive budget authorizations and allocations from SAF/FMB
   must issue budget authorizations and suballocations or allotments to themselves for direct
   administration and obligation, or to subordinate or lateral activities.
   3.1.4. Operational activities that receive budget authorizations and suballocations or
   allotments must use these authorizations for direct administration and obligation. However, if
   performance is to be by another activity, issue budget authorizations and allotments,
   suballotments, AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization, or other citation of funds to those
   activities.
   3.1.5. Recipients who subissue budget authorizations, suballocations, allotments, or
   suballotments may not remove nor add to restrictions contained in the instruments they
   receive.
   3.1.6. The ultimate user may subdivide the budget authorizations, allotments, or
   suballotments as necessary to maintain control over funds, provide data for budget estimates
   and reports, and provide for local management requirements.
   3.1.7. Commands, subcommands, or installations that receive budget authorizations and
   allotments or suballotments from parent organizations, which are to be obligated for the
   requirements of tenant units located on or supported by the host organization, will subdivide
   them when necessary to:
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                 29


       3.1.7.1. Make sure their use is in accordance with the tenant's approved financial plan.
       3.1.7.2. Maintain control on limitations placed on the use of funds.
       3.1.7.3. Provide required data for preparing and revising the tenant's annual financial
       plan and required reports.
   3.1.8. Further divisions of budget authorizations and allotments or suballotments by the
   ultimate user (for example, element of expense investment codes (EEIC) or responsibility
   center/cost center codes (RC/CC)), aren't subdivisions of funds under DFAS-DE ―Interim
   Guidance on Procedures for Administrative Control of Appropriations and Funds Made
   Available to the Department of the Air Force.‖ (NOTE: AF Form 616 isn't a subdivision of
   funds under DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 14.
3.2. Basis for Budget Authorizations:
   3.2.1. The approved annual financial plan is the basis for the budget authorizations issued by
   SAF/ FMB. SAF/FMB will advise the major commands (MAJCOM) and field operating
   agencies (FOA) of the approved financial program by issuing budget authorizations for the
   applicable fiscal or program year. All echelons of command responsible for issuing budget
   authorizations to subordinate or lateral organizations must make sure that the aggregate of
   amounts issued does not exceed the amount of the budget authorization received.
   3.2.2. Budget authorizations represent the approved financial program with which the
   recipient can plan to accomplish the mission in an orderly manner. Each additional budget
   authorization received for the applicable fiscal or program year must reflect the cumulative
   authorization for that year. Budget authorizations do not grant the authority to incur
   obligations and are not administrative subdivisions of funds under DoD FMR 7000.14-R,
   Vol. 14. For the procurement and RDT&E appropriations, see paragraph 3.6.1.1.
3.3. Expiration of Budget Authorizations. When the authority to incur new obligations
expires for an appropriation, the purpose of budget authorizations issued for such appropriations
will have been served and the budget authorizations become invalid. Don't make adjustments in
the budget authorizations after an appropriation expires for obligation purposes.
3.4. Using Allocations and Suballocations:
   3.4.1. Use an allocation or suballocation to delegate financial authority to the office
   responsible for making funds available for obligation. Air Force policy requires that fund
   allocations, suballocations, and allotments follow program responsibility; therefore, issue
   these documents to the commanders who administer the programs.
   3.4.2. HQ USAF allocates funds to commands in amounts consistent with the apportionment
   approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) or under a continuing resolution
   authority (CRA) passed by the Congress. Allocations represent a maximum limit for further
   suballocation, allotment, or suballotment. Allocations for multiple year appropriations are
   issued in full for each respective fiscal year's appropriation.
   3.4.3. MAJCOMs and FOAs must distribute allocations at once by issuing suballocations or
   allotments to intermediate commands or installations. (EXCEPTION: in the case of
   construction projects funded from the military construction and military family housing
   authorizations, the MAJCOM may retain a contingency reserve and review and approve all
   changes other than mandatory field changes.)

   3.4.4. Intermediate commands that receive suballocations must issue allotments to
   installations. Each additional allocation or suballocation received under an appropriation will
   be either an increase or decrease to the original amount received.
   3.4.5. Carry forward unobligated balances of quarterly allocations and suballocations to
   succeeding quarters of the fiscal year.
   3.4.6. Specific line items included on combined budget authorization and allocation
   documents issued by SAF/FM for the procurement and RDT&E appropriations are legal
   limitations under Title 31 U.S.C. and DFAS-DE Regulation 177-16. Include a statement to
   this effect in the remarks section of the combined document.
3.5. Using Allotments and Suballotments:
   3.5.1. The Air Force uses an allotment to make funds available for commitment or obligation
   from an allocation or suballocation. A suballotment makes funds available for commitment
   or obligation from an allotment. The allotment or suballotment grants and limits an
   installation's authority to incur commitments or obligations.
   3.5.2. Commands issue allotments or suballotments to installations in amounts consistent
   with the allocation or suballocations received from higher authority and with budget
   authorizations made to the installations.
3.6. Issuing Budget Authorizations and Allocations. SAF/FM issues budget authorizations
and allocations as follows:
   3.6.1. Aircraft Procurement (57*3010), Munitions Procurement (57*3011), Missile
   Procurement (57*3020), and Other Procurement (57*3080) appropriations are available for
   new obligation for 3 years. The RDT&E appropriation (57*3600) is available for new
   obligation for 2 years (except the amount established for management and support
   requirements that is available for only 1 year).
      3.6.1.1. For the life of the appropriation, budget authorizations (BAs) are issued at the
      same level and consistent with the related procurement or program authorization (PA)
      under each appropriation.
          3.6.1.1.1. Specific limitations to budget authorizations issued for these accounts are
          established by line items on AF Form 401, Budget Authority/Allotment, based on
          limitations imposed by the Department of Defense (DoD), Congress, SAF/FM, and
          reprogramming flexibility.
          3.6.1.1.2. The line item amount or ceiling amount, whichever is larger, on AF Form
          401 is an absolute restriction and has the same effect as a separate subdivision of
          funds within the related allocation or allotment (DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 14 and DFAS-
          DE ―Interim Guidance on Procedures for Administrative Control of Appropriations
          and Funds Made Available to the Department of the Air Force.‖) SAF/FM approval is
          required to exceed the line item or ceiling amount, whichever is larger, on AF Form
          401.
          3.6.1.1.3. To protect Air Force interests, request additional financing required to
          exercise a bid option within 24 hours after the bid opening. Refer requests that cannot
          be fulfilled using the authorized flexibility on AF Form 401 to SAF/FMBIX and
          AF/ILPR for 3080 funds, to SAF/ FMBIZ/AQXR for 3010 and 3600 funds, or
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             31


         SAF/FMBIX/AQXR for 3020 funds by the most expeditious means (telephone or
         priority message).
         3.6.1.1.4. Requests should indicate if required financing is available from other line
         items and by what date the adjustment is required. Confirm telephone requests in
         writing. Approved adjustments must be shown on the next PA and BA. When time is
         a critical factor, approve adjustments by message and confirm on the next PA and BA
         issued. Recipients of funding documents should maintain a suspense control system
         for timely follow-up and receipt of formal written copies of documents when
         authority is received by telephone or other informal means.
     3.6.1.2. SAF/FMB issues allocations at the appropriation level for each multiple-year
     period.
  3.6.2. Military Construction Air Force (57*3300), Military Construction Air Force Reserve
  (USAFR) (57*3730), Military Construction Air National Guard (ANG) (57*3830), and
  Family Housing Account (57*7040) appropriations are available for new obligation for 5
  years.
     3.6.2.1. Issue budget authorizations at budget program level, except budget programs
     320 and 330, and budget programs 351, 711, 712, 713, and 714 which are issued at the
     installation or construction program level.
     3.6.2.2. Issue allocations at appropriation level for the current and all program years,
     except for budget program 710 which is issued within the budget project level.
  3.6.3. Operation and Maintenance, ANG (57*3840) and Family Housing Account
  (57*7045). (See AFI 65-601, volume 2, for Operation and Maintenance, Air Force
  (57*3400), and Operation and Maintenance, Air Force Reserve (57*3740).)
     3.6.3.1. Issue budget authorizations at budget program activity level for each fiscal year.
     3.6.3.2. Issue allocations at appropriation level for each fiscal year.
  3.6.4. Military Personnel (57*3500), Reserve Personnel (57*3700), and National Guard
  Personnel, Air Force (57*3850):
     3.6.4.1. Issue budget authorizations at budget program and project level for each fiscal
     year.
     3.6.4.2. Issue allocations at appropriation level for each fiscal year.
  3.6.5. Military Assistance Program, Executive Appropriation (57-11*1080):
     3.6.5.1. Issue budget authorizations:
         3.6.5.1.1. At budget project level for the current program year and program level for
         prior program years under limitations .00l and .003.
         3.6.5.1.2. At program year level for limitations .002 and .004.
     3.6.5.2. Budget authorizations for the current year cover estimated current year
     requirements only (limitations .00l and .003). Budget authorizations for limitations .002
     and .004 cover program year requirements.
     3.6.5.3. Issue allocations for each limitation on a "from inception" basis.

     3.6.5.4. Chapter 17 and DFAS-DE OPLOC and Departmental Accounting Critical
     Processes, Flowcharts, Internal Management Controls, Responsibilities, and Procedures,
     Section 5 at https://dfas4dod.dfas.mil/library/opr/ contain procedures for International
     Military Education and Training (IMET) (57-11*1081) and Military Assistance Program,
     Executive Appropriation (MAP) (57-11*1080) funds.
  3.6.6. Chapter 17 and DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 15, Chapter 2 and DFAS-DE OPLOC and
  Departmental Accounting Critical Processes, Flowcharts, Internal Management Controls,
  Responsibilities, and Procedures, Section 5 at https://dfas4dod.dfas.mil/library/opr/ cover
  Foreign Military Sales Trust Fund (97-11X8242) budget authorization use.
  3.6.7. Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) (97*4930): The DoD Comptroller (DoD(C))
  issues annual Operating and Capital Budget authority schedules to the Air Force and other
  DoD Components. DoD(C) issues separate schedules providing official management cost
  goals for each AF Business Area. In turn, SAF/FMB issues operations and capital budget
  operating authority and Unit Cost (UC) goals to each Command/FOA with business areas in
  the DWCF. Activity goals may vary from the Component business area's total goal.
  However, the sum of the activity goals may not exceed the Component total cost authority.
  See Chapter 18.
  3.6.8. Air Force Management Fund (57X3960):
     3.6.8.1. Issue budget authorizations at the management fund project account level for
     each fiscal year.
     3.6.8.2. Issue allocations at the management fund project account level for each fiscal
     year.
  3.6.9. Wildlife Conservation, Military Reservations, Air Force (57X5095):
     3.6.9.1. Issue budget authorizations at appropriation level for each program year.
     3.6.9.2. Issue one allocation at appropriation level covering all program years.
     3.6.9.3. You may use allocations for any program year for which a budget authorization
     is issued.
  3.6.10. The Air Force will issue budget authorizations and allocations on any other
  appropriations or funds that the Air Force administers on the same basis as on comparable
  appropriations or funds identified above.
  3.6.11. Budget authorizations issued by HQ USAF reflect additional subcategorization used
  by HQ USAF to determine the overall authorizations. Such subcategorization is
  informational. It is neither a limitation of use of the budget authorization nor an indication of
  the number and type of subcategory breakouts that may be made by the ultimate user. Unless
  specifically stated to the contrary, this added detail is intended only to provide the recipient
  with a better understanding of the dollar amounts.
  3.6.12. The centrally managed account for foreign currency fluctuations (OAC 34), DFAS-
  DE, records the difference between the budgeted foreign currency rates versus those in effect
  at the time of payment for the operation and maintenance, Air Force appropriation. The
  amounts recorded in the account also serve as the basis for obtaining a nonexpenditure
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            33


   transfer authorization (SF 1151, Nonexpenditure Transfer Authorization) from the
   Foreign Currency Fluctuation, Defense Account.
3.7. Operating Centrally Managed Allotments (CMA):
   3.7.1. The Secretary of the Air Force must approve centrally managed allotments (CMA)
   (see DFAS-DE ―Interim guidance on Procedures for Administrative Control of
   Appropriations and Funds Made Available to the Department of the Air Force‖). AFMAN
   65-604 identifies the CMA under the respective appropriations and project accounts.
   3.7.2. Usually the Air Force uses these allotments to finance those activities where central
   controls are more practical than establishing controls with specific allotments. Examples of
   activities that are usually funded with CMAs are pay and allowances of military personnel
   and permanent change of station expenses, subsistence-in-kind, and medical care.
   3.7.3. CMAs provide a way to advise budget, accounting, purchasing, certifying officers,
   disbursing officers, and others that funds are available for the purpose authorized under the
   stated account classifications.
   3.7.4. The amount of the CMA is an administrative subdivision of funds in accordance with
   Title 31 U.S.C., as implemented by DFAS-DE ―Interim guidance on Procedures for
   Administrative Control of Appropriations and Funds Made Available to the Department of
   the Air Force.‖
   3.7.5. Activities that want to establish a CMA must obtain approval by the Secretary of the
   Air Force. Send the request to establish a CMA to SAF/FMPC in accordance with DFAS-DE
   ―Interim guidance on Procedures for Administrative Control of Appropriations and Funds
   Made Available to the Department of the Air Force‖ for review and evaluation to determine
   that adequate controls have been established to avoid overobligation.
      3.7.5.1. You must fully justify the need, delineate possible alternatives, and demonstrate
      clearly why the CMA method is the only practical administrative procedure.
      3.7.5.2. The official who establishes the CMA must, to the extent prescribed by law,
      directive, and regulation, make sure that obligations are not incurred in excess of the
      amount available.
   3.7.6. The establishing official is responsible for administering the CMA and must prescribe
   an adequate system of control to include: designation (by name or position) of specific
   individuals authorized to incur obligations or make expenditures against each CMA, and
   establishment of suitable limitations on the numbers, quantities, or volume for which
   obligations may be incurred. The system must provide for accounting and reporting at least
   monthly and ensure that timely notice is given to prevent the CMA from being overobligated
   by taking necessary management action, which may include:
      3.7.6.1. Increasing the amount of the CMA, before incurring an overobligation.
      3.7.6.2. Terminating the CMA.
      3.7.6.3. Taking other necessary management actions to prevent an overobligation.
   3.7.7. The official establishing a CMA must do an annual review to determine whether to
   continue its operation. The Secretary of the Air Force makes this determination. Include an
 34                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   internal evaluation of the control procedures established to prevent violation of Title 31
   U.S.C. and DFAS-DE 7000.1-R and recommend whether to continue the CMA.
3.8. YearEnd Adjustments:
   3.8.1. When an appropriation expires for new obligation purposes, the unobligated balance
   of allocations, suballocations, allotments, and suballotments, remains available for valid
   adjustments (DFAS Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations (formerly DFAS-DE
   7000.4-R and AFR 170-8)). Usually, the appropriate echelon of command doesn't withdraw
   the unobligated balance of allocations, suballocations, allotments, or suballotments until
   there is no known requirement for the balance. In turn, each echelon must advise the next
   higher headquarters when the balance or a portion of the balance is available for withdrawal.
   The issuing authority makes subsequent adjustments (usually downward) to an allocation,
   suballocation, allotment, or suballotment on the basis of information in the status of funds
   reports.
   3.8.2. If you need an additional allocation, suballocation, allotment, or suballotment because
   obligations incurred in a previous year weren't known until after 30 September, immediately
   request additional funds from the issuing authority. Give a full explanation of why you need
   the increase and comply with DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 14. See Chapter 2 on expiring
   appropriations and canceled accounts.
   3.8.3. After funds have expired for new obligations, it is imperative that Comptrollers,
   Budget Officers, Resource Advisors, and Contracting personnel, in cooperation with DFAS,
   review the status of prior year obligations and promptly deobligate invalid or unneeded
   Undelivered Orders Outstanding (UOO). A periodic review of these balances is required to
   assure that sufficient unobligated balances are available to cover upward obligation
   adjustments (claims, overruns, target-to-ceiling, etc.) and avoid the risk of incurring
   antideficiency violations.
3.9. Using AF Form 401, Budget Authority/Allotment:
   3.9.1. HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, intermediate commands, and FOAs use AF Form 401, or its
   mechanized equivalent, to issue budget authorizations, allocations, suballocations, allotments
   and suballotments, or make adjustments to these actions. Usually, you use AF Form 401 to
   issue other than O&M-type funds, and an Operating Budget Authority (OBA) document to
   issue O&M type funds (see AFI 65-601, volume 2). Funding issued on this form is an
   administrative subdivision of funds under DFAS-DE 7000.1-R; therefore, don't use it in lieu
   of the AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization. You may use the form for all appropriations
   or funds issued to subordinate activities. The receiving budget office must furnish a copy of
   the AF Form 401 to the servicing accounting office.
   3.9.2. Prepare AF Form 401 as follows:
      3.9.2.1. Heading. Self-explanatory except for the document number. Begin with number
      "1" at the start of the program year and continue in numerical sequence for each recipient
      organization for each appropriation.
      3.9.2.2. Program/Project Column. If control is maintained at other than appropriation
      level, enter control codes such as the budget program (BP), budget program activity code
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               35


       (BPAC), materiel program code (MPC), project/subproject, Budget Authorization
       Account Number, (BAAN), and/or program element code (PEC) in this column.
       3.9.2.3. Annual Budget Authority (ABA) Columns. Enter in the respective columns
       the total of previous funds issued, amount of increase or decrease, and revised funding
       available for the appropriation (or applicable BP, BPAC, MPC, PEC, project/subproject
       or BAAN) shown in the program/project column.
       3.9.2.4. Cumulative Quarterly Authority Column. These columns reflect the
       cumulative amount of funds issued starting with the first quarter of the program year. The
       AF Form 401 issued during the:
          3.9.2.4.1. First quarter will show cumulative amount authorized for the first quarter.
          3.9.2.4.2. Second quarter will show the cumulative amount from the beginning of the
          year for the second quarter.
          3.9.2.4.3. Third quarter will show the cumulative amounts from the beginning of the
          year for the third quarter.
          3.9.2.4.4. Fourth quarter will reflect annual program in the fourth quarter column.
       3.9.2.5. Remarks/Limitations Block:
          3.9.2.5.1. The issuer should identify the document as an allocation, suballocation, or
          allotment. For example, "This is a suballocation."
          3.9.2.5.2. Parent organizations issuing funds for tenants to host organizations must
          include information required by the host to administer the approved financial plan of
          the tenant.
          3.9.2.5.3. Limitations on issued funding will be in accordance with paragraph 3.1
          above.
          3.9.2.5.4. Other remarks should include any general information that would provide
          the recipient with a better understanding of entries shown on the upper parts of the
          AF Form 401.
       3.9.2.6. During the year of execution, quarterly obligation authority issued by
       SAF/FMBOI on funding documents to commands is based on gross obligations, not gross
       commitments in the accounting system. However, quarterly and annual obligation
       authority available to a command must be sufficient to cover that command’s gross
       commitments.
3.10. Using AF Form 402, Obligation Authority/Suballotment. Only SAF/FMB and their
servicing accounting and finance office (SAF/FMBMBAFO) use the AF Form 402
(hereafter called OA). Its use is considered an administrative subdivision of funds under DoD
7000.14-R, Vol. 14, Administrative Control of Appropriations. These funds are available for
obligation for a specified period of time and only for a designated purpose. The OA limits the
making of obligations to the amount shown, but unlike other administrative subdivisions, you
record it as a commitment against funds provided to the SAF/FMB servicing AFO
(SAF/FMBMB-AFO) on an Operating Budget Authority (OBA) or allotment document. If valid
obligations (per DFAS Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations (formerly DFAS-DE
7000.4-R and AFR 170-8)) exceed the amount of the OA, a reportable violation occurs. You
 36                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


must report it under DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 14 and DFAS-DE ―Interim guidance on Procedures
for Administrative Control of Appropriations and Funds Made Available to the Department of
the Air Force.‖ (NOTE: Base level activities may not issue the AF Form 402. They may use AF
Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization, per DFAS-DE 7010.1-R.)
   3.10.1. Address OAs to the Designated Head of the Activity Receiving the Funds. This
   person may delegate authority to administer the OA to a qualified individual within his or her
   organization; to the individual who will incur the obligations; or if mutually agreeable, to the
   host FSO. The AFO (SAF/FMBMB-AFO) issuing the OA must know in advance who will
   administer the OA.
   3.10.2. Examples of Obligations Authorized by an OA:
      3.10.2.1. Base procurement of items authorized for local purchase.
      3.10.2.2. Purchase of items which require control subject to the issuer of an OA. The
      issuer can control by a thorough review of the documents pertaining to such purchases.
      3.10.2.3. Other items authorized by the issuer as shown in the purpose block of the OA.
   3.10.3. Restrictions and Limitations. An OA must be issued for a specific period of time
   and dollar amount.
      3.10.3.1. The period of the OA can't extend beyond the expiration date of the
      appropriation. Review OAs issued against multiple-year appropriations at the end of each
      fiscal year to determine if they are still valid for the next fiscal year.
      3.10.3.2. Issue OAs in specific amounts; that is, the maximum amount that can be
      obligated. If the amount is later determined to be insufficient, the receiving office must
      promptly request a supplemental OA.
      3.10.3.3. Recipients can't issue subsidiary OAs. The funds must either be obligated by
      the recipient or returned unobligated to the issuing AFO (SAF/FMBMB-AFO).
   3.10.4. Instructions for the Issuing AFO (SAF/FMBMB-AFO):
      3.10.4.1. Prepare the face of the AF Form 402 to show:
          3.10.4.1.1. Advice number assigned by the issuing AFO (SAF/FMBMB-AFO).
          Assign this number and add a sequence number for each change issued against the
          original document.
          3.10.4.1.2. Date issued.
          3.10.4.1.3. Expiration date of authority granted by the document.
          3.10.4.1.4. Name and address of the holder (recipient).
          3.10.4.1.5. Name, address, and telephone number of person who will administer the
          OA and be responsible for providing obligation documents to the issuing AFO
          (SAF/FMBMB-AFO).
          3.10.4.1.6. Complete accounting classification, the year the appropriation expires,
          and authorized amount.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                           37


        3.10.4.1.7. The authorized purposes of the OA such as services to be performed,
        specific projects, issuing office limitations, and other items necessary to control the
        OA.
        3.10.4.1.8. Signature with typed name and grade of the issuing AFO (SAF/FMBMB-
        AFO).
     3.10.4.2. Complete the first line on reverse side of OA to show:
        3.10.4.2.1. Date OA was issued in Document Date column.
        3.10.4.2.2. Advice number of OA in Document Reference Number column.
        3.10.4.2.3. Leave Commitment and Obligation Amount columns blank.
        3.10.4.2.4. Total amount of the OA in Available Balance column.
     3.10.4.3. Prepare the OA in triplicate. Send the original and first copy to the holder.
     Keep the second copy. Post the amount of the OA in the accounting records as a
     commitment. Record subsequent obligations in the accounting records as obligation
     documents are received. Upon receipt of the completed OA, reconcile the obligations
     recorded with the obligations shown on the reverse of the OA to make sure copies of all
     documents have been received and recorded. When a completed or expired OA is
     received by the issuing AFO (SAF/FMBMB-AFO) on which commitments have been
     recorded but no obligations have been incurred, decommit the unobligated balance of the
     OA and set up commitments based on each commitment document attached.
     3.10.4.4. Note that AF Form 402 provides preprinted written instructions to the
     recipient/holder on its proper use and maintenance. The issuing AFO (SAF/FMBMB-
     AFO) may provide additional written instructions on the OA to the recipient at the time it
     is issued. Such instructions must include guidance necessary to satisfy SAF/FMB and
     issuing AFO requirements.
     3.10.4.5. Note that the recipient of the OA is considered an agent of the issuing AFO
     (SAF/ FMBMB-AFO) and must comply with all instructions received, either separately
     or on the face of the OA.
        3.10.4.5.1. Show the complete accounting classification on all commitment and
        obligation documents including the OA advice number of the issuing activity.
        3.10.4.5.2. Make sure the individual who has been designated by the recipient to
        administer the OA annotates each new commitment or obligation to avoid exceeding
        the available balance of the OA. This individual must list each transaction on the
        reverse side of the AF Form 402.
            3.10.4.5.2.1. Continue the record on another sheet if more lines are needed. Show
            the date, reference number of the document, amount of the commitment or
            obligation, and the new available balance.
            3.10.4.5.2.2. If an obligation was previously recorded as a commitment, reverse
            the commitment, and record the obligation. Compute a new available balance
            after each transaction.
            3.10.4.5.2.3. If a commitment or obligation is canceled totally or partially before
38                                           AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


        the obligating document is sent to the issuing AFO (SAF/FMBMB-AFO), record
        the cancellation on the reverse side of the AF Form 402 and increase the available
        balance accordingly. EXCEPTION: if cancellation occurs after the obligating
        document is sent to the issuing AFO (SAF/FMBMB-AFO), don't record the
        cancellation nor increase the available balance. Instead, send the notice of
        cancellation to the issuing AFO (SAF/FMBMB-AFO) for deobligation.
        3.10.4.5.2.4. Use the Remarks column to record data that may help control the
        OA.
     3.10.4.5.3. Send copies of all obligating documents to the issuing AFO
     (SAF/FMBMB-AFO) as obligations are incurred or as specified (daily, weekly,
     monthly, etc.) by the issuing AFO (SAF/FMBMB-AFO) in written instructions.
     3.10.4.5.4. Make sure the recipient or individual designated to administer an OA
     cites the OA on a message, letter, or other procurement request. The procurement
     request must be for a one-time requirement and must be specific as to amount. The
     individual administering the OA signs as the fund certifying official. The amount
     available for obligation or certification is the beginning balance less all commitments
     and obligations posted. It is a violation of DFAS-DE ―Interim guidance on
     Procedures for Administrative Control of Appropriations and Funds Made Available
     to the Department of the Air Force‖ to exceed the available balance by incurring
     either committing or obligating funds in excess of the available balance.
     3.10.4.5.5. Return the duplicate copy of the OA to the issuing AFO (SAF/FMBMB-
     AFO) when the action for which the OA is issued is completed, the OA is fully
     obligated, or when the OA expires, whichever occurs first. When funds have been
     cited against an OA, the OA may be held by the recipient pending receipt of
     obligation documents, but not beyond the expiration date of the OA. Attach a copy of
     each outstanding procurement request for which obligation documents have not been
     received.
     3.10.4.5.6. If unposted obligation documents are received after the duplicate copy of
     the OA has been returned to the issuing AFO (SAF/FMBMB-AFO), send the
     documents to the issuing AFO (SAF/FMBMB-AFO) as soon as possible. Do not post
     these amounts to the OA. Annotate in the Remarks column the obligation amount and
     date sent to the AFO (SAF/ FMBMB-AFO).
     3.10.4.5.7. An OA on which commitments have been recorded must be controlled
     until all obligation documents have been received or the commitment canceled.
     3.10.4.5.8. Follow-up to determine the obligation status when obligating documents
     have not been received within 30 days after funds have been committed.
     3.10.4.5.9. Cancel all commitments that will not be obligated at fiscal year-end (30
     September) for expiring funds. When funds from an OA are cited on procurement
     requests, advise the person who will incur the obligation that obligations cannot be
     incurred past the expiration date of the appropriation. Obligation documents must be
     received at FY-end by the person administering the OA in enough time to have the
     obligation recorded in the accounting records by the AFO and certified in FY-end
     reports.

   3.10.5. See DFAS-DE OPLOC and Departmental Accounting Critical Processes,
   Flowcharts, Internal Management Controls, Responsibilities, and Procedures, Section 5 at
   https://dfas4dod.dfas.mil/library/opr/ for AF Form 402 usage with the Foreign Military
   Sales Trust Fund (97-11X8242).
3.11. Locally Prescribed Forms and Formats. Air Force activities that have implemented
mechanized procedures for issuing budget authorizations, allocations, suballocations, and
allotments may substitute computer-generated forms, properly identified as AF Form 401, Apr
84 (electronic form), for the AF Form 401. The use of an electronically reproduced equivalent of
an original signature is acceptable for a document requiring an original signature.
   3.11.1. Accomplish internal control of fund documentation through use of computer
   software.
   3.11.2. Command fund control systems will provide validation of fund authorities by use of
   access codes and lockout procedures.
   3.11.3. Budget analysts will use one set of assigned access codes to prepare fund
   authorizations. Individuals with the signature authority will use other controlled access codes
   to cause their signature element and an authorization symbol to appear in the signature
   section of the fund document and permit the transmission of the authority to the funded
   activity.
   3.11.4. Transmit the authentication, signature element, and symbol to the field as part of the
   funding document.
   3.11.5. The issuing activity will retain signed originals of the computer-generated fund
   documents.
3.12. Emergency Funding Actions. When urgent funding adjustments are required, you may
need to use interim methods (messages, telcons, etc.). Continue to maintain funds control
discipline in these situations. This discipline must ensure that activities don't inadvertently
violate DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 14.
   3.12.1. Funding by Messages, Datafaxes, Etc. When using this technique, include in your
   correspondence, as a minimum: the FY and appropriation being adjusted, the effective date
   of the adjustment, funds information (previous total, adjustment, and the revised total), and
   the name and phone number of the issuing action officer. In addition, advise the receiving
   activity to promptly acknowledge receipt of the adjustment.
   3.12.2. Funding by Telecon. Both the issuing and receiving activities will immediately
   document the transaction with a memo for record. The memo will minimally include: the FY
   and appropriation being adjusted, funds information (previous total, adjustment, and the
   revised total), and the name and phone number of both the issuer and receiver.
   3.12.3. Follow-up Requirements. In all emergency transactions, the issuing activity will
   issue a formal funding document, reflecting the adjustments, within 1 month or at the next
   document issue cycle, whichever occurs first. Both the issuing and receiving activities will
   establish follow-up suspenses to ensure compliance with the formal funding document
   timeframe requirements.

      BUDGETING AND FUNDING GUIDANCE FOR VARIOUS APPROPRIATIONS

Section 4A—Obligating Funds During the Last Two Months of the Fiscal Year

4.1. Applying the 20-Percent Limit on Obligations. Except as noted below, obligate no more
than 20 percent of your annual (1 year) appropriations during August and September of any
fiscal year. Every department or agency must apply this limit at the appropriation level rather
than against each budget program or project, with one exception: for the Reserve Personnel
appropriation, apply the 20-percent limit to the total of the annual budget authorizations for
projects that must meet this limit.
   4.1.1. If HQ USAF directly issues funds to your command, limit Operation and
   Maintenance Appropriations (3400, 3740 and 3840).
   4.1.2. If you're in the Air National Guard (ANG), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), or
   Air Education and Training Command (AETC), do not limit your Military Personnel
   appropriation (3700 and 3850).
4.2. Applying Exceptions to the 20-percent Limit. Don't limit obligations during August and
September of the fiscal year if Figure 4.1 below applies to you.

Section 4B—Information Processing Equipment (IPE) and Resources
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                43


4.3. Budgeting and Funding for General Purpose IPE. Whether you're in an Active or
Reserve component, follow this section to select the correct appropriation for funding to develop,
buy, lease, and maintain Information Processing (IP) Resources. Acquisition of IPE may involve
procurement actions ranging from base-wide, organization, or functional community local area
network (LAN) systems down to ancillary equipment (e.g., personal computers, printers, etc.)
and software that operates totally independent of a LAN. When commands can't agree to funding
responsibilities, refer the matter to SAF/FMBM.
   4.3.1. LAN Acquisition. LANs consist of any equipment that is integral to the operation of
   a LAN system to include file servers, cable, personal computers (PCs) and other support
   components (e.g., line drivers, multiplexers, etc.). A LAN is further subdivided into its
   lowest system form: base-wide, organizational (e.g., wing, squadron, division, branch, etc.),
   or functional community (e.g., logistics, maintenance, civil engineering, etc.).
       4.3.1.1. Include the total cost of each independent LAN system when applying the
       $250,000 expense and investment criteria to a procurement action. Include any additional
       LAN installation costs (e.g., quality assurance, system engineering, equipment
       installation, testing, etc.) in the aggregate cost of all equipment items being acquired to
       make the LAN system operate. You must apply the expense and investment threshold to
       the aggregate cost of the entire system. (NOTE: Use O&M funds, EEIC 592, to finance
       installation if anyone other than the prime contractor (or direct subcontractor) installs the
       system or modifies it as a result state-of-the-art changes (see paragraph 8.21.2)).
       4.3.1.2. LAN system modifications or upgrades of equipment essential to LAN
       operations obligated within any 12-month period should be considered part of the same
       requirement and the total cost will be subject to the expense and investment criteria. Cost
       each upgrade or modification separately from the original purchase. The same applies to
       parts purchased to replace components, which are functioning but "are no longer
       logistically supportable." Ensure that LAN system modifications or upgrades are not an
       attempt to fragment the requirement to circumvent the expense and investment threshold.
   4.3.2. Ancillary IPE Acquisition. Ancillary IPE consists of personal computers (PC),
   printers, etc., whose primary purpose is to operate independently from the LAN, as well as
   repair parts, components, network spares, and PC upgrades. In these cases apply the expense
   and investment threshold to each individual equipment purchased on a "cost per component"
   basis. Repair parts or components should be functionally equivalent to the unit being
   replaced and purchased to replace a failed component. Use O&M funds for these types of
   requirements if each component purchased is less than $250,000 (current threshold). The
   overriding rule is that stand-alone operational integrity of an ancillary IPE must be
   maintained in deciding to procure, upgrade, or modify IPE using O&M funding.
   4.3.3. PC Application Software Loaded on Network File Server. MAJCOMs and
   installations must implement management controls to ensure that sufficient applications
   software is procured to permit implementation of stand-alone operation of each PC, should
   the network fail for an extended period of time. The major task is to ensure that only the
   authorized number of copies of application software are procured, installed and used
   throughout the network, whether in a networked mode (launched from the file server) or
   from the individual PC hard drives. Where the application software is to be loaded or stored,
   doesn't determine the type of expense and investment funding to be used for a PC, only
 44                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   whether the PC can operate independently or is integral to a LAN's system operation.
   Purchase sufficient application software at the same time network PCs are procured using
   O&M funds to ensure stand-alone PC operational integrity is maintained. EXCEPTION:
   Those requirements where the procurement of a PC is intended to upgrade older, less capable
   computer equipment and the application software can be reused on a one-for-one basis on the
   upgraded PC.
4.4. O&M Funded Facilities and Activities. Finance the acquisition and operation of IP
resources supporting O&M funded facilities and activities as follows:
   4.4.1. Leasing or Maintaining IPE. Use O&M funds.
   4.4.2. Acquiring IPE. Apply the $250,000 expense and investment threshold criteria to the
   total cost of the IPE system to determine which appropriation to use. (NOTE: An IPE system
   is a group of components that are interconnected, designed mainly to operate together, and
   procured at the same time. The complete system cost is the aggregate cost of all components
   that are part of, and function together, as a system to meet a documented requirement.)
      4.4.2.1. Use O&M if the total system cost is under $250,000.
      4.4.2.2. Use Other Procurement if the total system exceeds $250,000 or more.
      4.4.2.3. Use Other Procurement funds for centrally managed equipment items. (The
      $250,000 threshold doesn't apply; see Figure 4.3)
      4.4.2.4. Exclude contract costs associated with the preparation of real property (e.g.,
      building modification, cable trenching, etc.; see Figure 4.1).
      4.4.2.5. Don't fragment the validated requirement for IP, or upgrade to a communications
      or automatic data processing system or acquire IP in a piecemeal fashion in order to
      circumvent the expense and or investment criteria guidance.
      4.4.2.6. Apply the determination of expense or investment cost on the basis of each
      system in the requirements document (e.g., Communications Systems Requirements
      Document, Base Communications-Computer Systems Comprehensive Blueprint, etc.), if
      the document includes more than one system. Purchasing several items at the same time
      does not necessarily mean the items are part of one system. For example, if you are
      buying four small computers for administrative offices in an organization, which may be
      interconnected (e.g., for sending electronic mail), consider these as four separate systems
      if their primary purpose is to operate independently. Regarding LANs, a basic rule to
      follow is that separate requirements documents should be prepared for items integral to
      an independent LAN's operation and items not integral to a LAN's operation.
      4.4.2.7. Using Productivity Programs. If you are purchasing IPE under provisions of
      productivity enhancing capital investment (PECI) programs, group the IPE to comprise
      an integrated system (or systems) capable of amortizing all investment costs within the
      criteria established in AFI 38-301. Apply the expense/investment rule criteria to
      determine correct funding.
   4.4.3. Acquiring Software:
      4.4.3.1. Use O&M funds (without regard to investment threshold and without including
      software in the total system cost) for:
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              45


         4.4.3.1.1. Software maintenance and minor modification, and for other IP contractual
         services.
         4.4.3.1.2. Software that is not obtained from a development or services contract and
         for which the Air Force obtains unlimited data rights (i.e., the Air Force will actually
         own the software and be free to use, duplicate, distribute, and dispose of the software
         without restriction from its publisher or developer).
     4.4.3.2. Use O&M or investment funds based on the expense/investment threshold (and
     include in the total system cost, if applicable) for application software with limited data
     rights or licensed to the Air Force (proprietary software).
     4.4.3.3. Use RDT&E funds to obtain software via a software development contract (i.e.,
     where the acquiring activity pays a contractor for the software development services).
     4.4.3.4. Air Force organizations may accept investment funds from organizations outside
     of the Air Force for the purpose of buying software with limited data rights or that is
     licensed.
  4.4.4. Communications Cable Funding:
     4.4.4.1. For maintenance and repair of existing cable (e.g., metallic, fiber optic, premise
     wiring, etc.) regardless of whether or not the cable is located inside a building or between
     buildings, Commands will always use O&M funds for these requirements.
     4.4.4.2. For an entire information transport system (e.g., cable plant) purchase and
     installation the expense and investment criteria will be applied. Other Procurement funds
     will be used for information transport systems (ITS) that exceed $250,000. O&M funds
     may be used if the system cost is $250,000 or less.
     4.4.4.3. For ITS expansion (e.g., jobs requiring new fiber optic cable to accommodate
     base population growth, new building construction, or a cable expansion to accommodate
     LAN users in other buildings in order to provide solely E-mail or file transfer type
     connectivity between LANs that operate independently of each other), Commands will
     follow rules of minor construction projects. If the specific requirement is less than
     $750,000, then Commands will use O&M funds. If an expansion is above $750,000,
     Commands will document the requirement in the Base Communications-Computer
     Systems Comprehensive Blueprint (BCB) where it can be centrally funded (e.g., Combat
     Information Transport System or Base Communications Infrastructure) using Other
     Procurement funds. LAN expansion efforts within a particular building will continue to
     be governed by the LAN acquisition guidance in paragraph 4.3.1.1 above. In short, an
     independent LAN that is spread between buildings will include cable connectivity costs
     within the aggregate costs of the overall LAN since the cable is an integral part of the
     LAN system operation.
  4.4.5. Land Mobile Radio Systems. To comply with the National Telecommunications and
  Information Administration mandated reduction of frequencies; the Air Force must replace
  all wideband systems between FY 05 and FY 08. For the purchase of new trunked systems
  exceeding $250K, use Other Procurement funds to acquire the trunked infrastructure
  (antennas, base stations, repeaters) and enough radios to achieve initial operational capability
  for one functional set. O&M funds should be used to purchase the remainder of the
 46                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   individual radios, each of which is less than the expense/investment threshold. For future
   infrastructure upgrades, use O&M or investment funds based on the expense/investment
   threshold.
4.5. RDT&Efunded Facilities and Activities. Use RDT&E for all of the costs identified in
4.4, above, for funding by the O&M and Other Procurement appropriations.
   4.5.1. Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) Facilities and Activities. Use DWCF
   funds to finance all costs identified in 4.4, above, for funding by the O&M and Other
   Procurement appropriations. DFAS-DER 7410.1 Chapter 2 has special guidance for funding
   of management systems development costs for DWCF activities.
4.6. Site Preparation. Table 4.1 contains guidance for determining the type of funds to use for
IPE site preparation. Additional guidance is in paragraph 8.18.
   4.6.1. Table 4.1 covers two situations: Alteration of an existing facility to accommodate new
   IPE or to better accommodate IPE currently housed in the facility (columns 2 and 3); and
   addition to an existing facility or construction of a new facility to accommodate IPE
   (columns 4 and 5).
   4.6.2. Types of funds are denoted by CON for construction, EQP for investment equipment,
   and EXP for expense.

   depending on the total cost, when you procure or install air conditioning systems as RPIE in
   conjunction with new construction or construction of an addition to a new facility (see Section
   8E, Chapter 8).
2. Purchase individual equipment items costing over $250,000 with investment equipment funds;
   all other items are expense.
3. Use investment equipment funds if you purchase the UPS on an installed basis; otherwise,
   installation is an expense. The associated site preparation is always construction for addition or
   new construction.
4. If you purchase the HALON 1301 total flooding system on an installed basis, use investment
   equipment funds; otherwise, purchase individual equipment items costing more than $250,000
   with investment equipment funds; all other costs are expense.
4.7. Embedded Computers. Apply the following rules to determine how to fund embedded
Information Processing Equipment (IPE) and software developed or acquired under the systems
management procedures (acquisition series of instructions).
   4.7.1. Use RDT&E to:
       4.7.1.1. Fund all initial IPE and software development efforts up to the point where an
       operational configuration baseline has been tested, evaluated, and accepted or qualified.
       4.7.1.2. Finance the design, development, test and evaluation of embedded IPE and
       software. This includes all costs related to feasibility studies, system design, preparation,
       integration (including interface with other systems or subsystems), and associated
       documentation.
       4.7.1.3. Design and develop training devices, such as simulators, that employ new or off-
       the-shelf computers and system components, but have software and interface components
       unique to the training system. Use RDT&E for the initial system and all of its support
       cost through acceptance by the Air Force. Typically, these training devices have small
       quantity requirements and the initial system is eventually used for operational training.
 48                                                 AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   4.7.2. Don't use RDT&E funds beyond the initial system unless the training organization
   needs more than one full system to demonstrate the training device performance before
   accepting it.
   4.7.3. To buy fully developed and tested IPE and software, use the same appropriation that
   funds the acquisition of the weapon or support system of which it is a part. Fund fully
   developed and tested IPE and software associated with an equipment modification with the
   same appropriation that funds the production mod kits (see also paragraph Chapter 8,
   Section 8G for guidance on modification funding).
   4.7.4. Use O&M-type funds to finance the maintenance of embedded IPE and software,
   except for investment items necessary for maintenance. Use procurement appropriations to
   finance investment items that are funded by the procurement appropriations. Paragraph 4.7
   applies for embedded IPE and software used in research and development programs or
   owned by RDT&E funded activities.
   4.7.5. Fund changes to existing operational software as follows:
       4.7.5.1. Use O&M-type appropriations or funds for changes designed to correct latent
       errors or deficiencies in software programs that otherwise meet criteria for operational
       suitability and usefulness.
       4.7.5.2. Use O&M-type appropriations or funds for changes designed to improve
       reliability, maintainability, safety, or that otherwise qualify as normal life-cycle support.
       4.7.5.3. Use RDT&E funds for changes designed to increase the capability of the system
       to perform its mission, to add new capability, or to remove an existing capability.
       However, use the O&M-type appropriation that funds the maintenance for software
       changes (or blocks of such changes) that are relatively minor in scope and cost, and that
       can be accomplished during regular software maintenance.
   4.7.6. See Chapter 8, Section 8G for instruction on funding software changes related to
   equipment modification engineering tasks. Use O&M, RDT&E or DWCF funds for other
   software changes associated with end item modification programs as discussed elsewhere in
   paragraphs 4.8 and 8.26.
4.8. Funding Other Equipment with Computers. This category includes equipment items
such as materiel handling equipment that contain or depend upon computer devices but are not
C4 systems.
   4.8.1. Use procurement accounts to finance the initial acquisition cost.
   4.8.2. Finance software changes as an expense.
   4.8.3. Finance such charges from the DWCF for DWCF-funded facilities and activities

Section 4C—Honoraria

4.9. Approving Honoraria and Speaking Fees. Commanders should make sure that persons
engaged to deliver speeches, lectures, and presentations don't receive excessive fees from
appropriated funds. Follow the guidance below for paying honoraria and speaking fees:
   4.9.1. Use O&M funds to pay honoraria or fees according to established approval levels:
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               49


Table 4.2. Honoraria Approval Thresholds.

      Installation Commanders                     $500 or less
      MAJCOM, FOA, DRU Commanders                 $2,000 or less
      HQ USAF/CVA                                 More than $2,000
       4.9.1.1. To determine the appropriate approval level for honorariums or speaking fees,
       only the actual amount of the honorarium or speaking fee, excluding per diem and travel
       expenses, will constitute the cost against which the threshold is to be applied. If a person
       is going to sign a speaking contract for $1,000 and that contract is for 4 speeches on an
       installation at $250 each, the $1,000 contract would determine the approval level required
       (MAJCOM, FOA, DRU Commander), not the $250 cost of each address.
   4.9.2. Follow the guidance in Section 22 of the Defense Acquisition Regulation (and FAR
   Section 37) in contracting for such nonpersonal services.

Section 4D—Emergency and Special Program (ESP) Codes

4.10. Assigning ESP Codes. Air Force activities at all levels assign ESP codes. These special
accounting and reporting codes collect costs incurred during an emergency or in support of a
special program.
4.11. Using ESP Codes:
   4.11.1. The assigning FM organization along with the activity requiring the data will assign
   a title to each ESP code, and will determine whether incremental or total costs need to be
   collected.
   4.11.2. Comptrollers and budget officers at all levels must make sure that operating
   personnel are made aware of the importance of properly identifying and capturing all costs
   associated with emergency and special programs. Only accurate cost data can provide the
   documentation to obtain funding or reimbursement when appropriate and meet reporting
   requirements.
   4.11.3. Installations or commands must send requests for establishing Air Force-wide ESP
   codes through MAJCOM/FM channels to SAF/FMBMM for assignment of an Air Staff
   sponsor. Describe the program or situation that requires cost identification and indicate
   whether full or incremental costs should be collected. SAF/FMB will assign the code and
   issue implementing instructions. In addition, once a year (usually in September) SAF/FMB
   issues a list of all Air Force level ESP codes for the next fiscal year.
   4.11.4. ESP codes apply to all appropriations. Use these codes on all applicable
   commitment, obligation, and expenditure documents, generally placing them in the
   accounting classification immediately following the accounting and disbursing station
   number (ADSN) (for example: ESP Code AA).

Section 4E—Technical Data
 50                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


4.12. Financing the Procurement and Printing of Technical Data. The source of funds to
procure and print tech data depends upon the appropriation or fund that procures the end item of
equipment or system to which the data is applicable. Apply funds as follows:
   4.12.1. Acquisition Phase. Pay for the initial technical data with the same appropriation
   (and budget program) or DWCF business activity that pays for the end item of equipment or
   system being supported. Include the cost of both the reproducible copy and the cost of
   printing multiple copies, whether you obtain the printing by a separate contract from a
   government printing plant or as a provision of the production contract. Use these same rules
   for spare and repair parts.
   4.12.2. Modifications. Pay for all technical data required as a result of a modification to an
   end item of equipment or system with the same appropriation (and budget program) or
   DWCF activity that pays for the modification. Use the rules for printing in the preceding
   paragraph. See also Chapter 8.
   4.12.3. Post Acquisition and Modification Phase. Use O&M (EEIC 594) in these
   situations, but only when the technical data support equipment or systems are financed with
   procurement appropriations (3010, 3011, 3020, 3080). (See paragraph 4.12.5 for printing
   and reproduction costs.)
       4.12.3.1. When production contracts and modification contracts funded with investment
       appropriations no longer exist to satisfy requirements for reproducible copy not initially
       procured with the equipment or system.
       4.12.3.2. For new requirements for developing and preparing equipment program master
       tapes for out of production (in-service) equipment.
       4.12.3.3. To finance the revision or replacement of previously procured technical data
       that has become unusable due to excessive use, abuse, or loss and to fund the changes
       needed to bring the guidance into current status.
   4.12.4. Use DWCF funds for the technical data and associated requirements when the
   equipment is procured by the DWCF or when modifications to that equipment require
   technical data after production or modifications.
   4.12.5. Funding Printing and Reproduction Requirements. Use O&M funds - EEIC 501
   for printing by the Government Printing Office (GPO) and by commercial printers and EEIC
   502 for printing by the Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS) - (NOTE: The DWCF
   finances all of the foregoing requirements for equipment funded by the Defense Working
   Capital Fund.)
       4.12.5.1. To finance the contractual printing (reproduction) of multiple copies of
       technical data (or literature from technical data) applicable to out-of-production
       equipment and systems. This rule does not apply to printing requirements relating to
       initial equipment or system data procurement, modification and initial tech data funded
       with investment appropriations.
       4.12.5.2. To pay for contractual reproduction (duplication) of automatic equipment
       program master tapes prepared from Air Force-owned reproducible master tapes.
       4.12.5.3. See DoDD 5330.3 for policy on use of DAPS.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                           51


4.13. Funding Engineering Drawing Requirements:
   4.13.1. When obtained in connection with procurement of equipment or a system, use the
   same appropriation (and budget program) or DWCF business area as used to finance
   procurement of the equipment or system for which the drawings are required. These same
   funds also finance the printing or reproduction of multiple copies.
   4.13.2. When procured in conjunction with a modification, use the same appropriation (and
   budget program) or DWCF activity that financed the modification. This applies both to the
   cost of the drawings and the printing of needed multiple copies.
   4.13.3. To finance the following requirements, use either O&M funds (EEIC 594) if the
   equipment or system was procured or modified using investment funds, or DWCF funds if
   the equipment was procured or modified with DWCF funds:
       4.13.3.1. Replacement of previously procured drawings that have now become unusable
       due to excessive use (illegible, worn or torn).
       4.13.3.2. Drawings needed for purposes other than equipment or system procurement,
       and required because they were not originally procured on the production or modification
       contract, which is now closed.
       4.13.3.3. The cost of contractual engineering or drafting talent when needed to update,
       consolidate or redraw existing engineered drawings.
       4.13.3.4. Contractual accomplishment of master layout (MLO) drawings, templates, tube
       bend data and like items.
   4.13.4. Use O&M funds (EEIC 501) to finance the contractual cost of printing or
   reproducing necessary multiple copies of drawings for equipment or systems procured with
   investment appropriations. Use DWCF for the same requirement for equipment procured by
   DWCF.
4.14. Commercial Manuals. Initial procurement of these manuals is part of the equipment or
system procurement cost. Apply the following for additional copies:
   4.14.1. Charge to O&M (EEIC 501) if the Air Force has reproduction rights and the
   equipment or system was procured with investment appropriations and the manual is
   incorporated into the system.
   4.14.2. Charge the printing cost to DWCF if the manuals are applicable to equipment
   procured by DWCF.
   4.14.3. Charge the cost to O&M (EEIC 594) if a commercial manual has a TO number, but
   only for those manuals applicable to equipment or systems procured with investment
   appropriations.
   4.14.4. Charge the printing to DWCF if the manuals are applicable to equipment or systems
   procured by DWCF.
4.15. Technical Data for Replenishment Spares Procurement. Charge both the cost of the
reproducible copy and the cost of reproducing multiple copies to the same funds used to procure
the spare parts if procuring replenishment spares involves acceptance of:
   4.15.1. A substitute item,
 52                                                 AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   4.15.2. A different manufacturer of the item, or
   4.15.3. A new item specification, and
   4.15.4. New specifications, new technical data, or revisions to existing data are required.
4.16. Technical Data for Common Support Equipment. Finance changes to weapon systems
technical data resulting from the replacement of common support equipment from the
appropriation buying the equipment.

Section 4F—Space Launch Support Services

4.17. Financing Launch Services. Fund launch support services as follows:
   4.17.1. If the launch is of a research and development (3600 funded) payload, use the
   RDT&E (3600) appropriation.
   4.17.2. If the launch is of an operational (3020 funded) payload, use the Missile Procurement
   (3020) appropriation budgeted in the year of the launch.
   4.17.3. Charge launch support services provided by Major Range and Test Facility Bases
   (MRTFBs) to the funding appropriation as indicated above on a direct cost basis per AFI 99-
   101. Use O&M funds to pay for standard range support costs.
   4.17.4. Contractor launch support services budgeted in Procurement appropriations are
   incrementally funded if they are not related to the delivery of an end item (OSD (C) (P/B)
   May 16, 1997 Policy).
4.18. Propellants Funding. Use O&M (3400) funds to pay for liquid and gaseous propellants.
Pay for solid propellants with 3020 funds.

Section 4G—Organizational, Intermediate, and Depot Logistic Support Provided By
Contractors

4.19. Funding Contractor Support Programs:
   4.19.1. Interim Contractor Support (ICS). Budget and fund ICS in the weapon
   system/equipment procurement line item or the weapon system/equipment modification
   procurement line, as applicable. When non-Air Force agencies require work on an Air Force
   ICS contract, the using activity will reimburse the appropriate procurement account through
   the responsible system program office. Budget for the ICS on the end item line or
   modification procurement line even if there is no end item or modification kit being
   procured. ICS specifically refers only to the use of a contractor in the following cases:
       4.19.1.1. The items to be supported or items of support equipment that have an unstable
       design, and the projected cost of setting up an organic capability at the time operational
       support is first required is excessive, due to uncertainties in the type and level of support
       required because of the risk that support resources will become obsolete if procured too
       early.
       4.19.1.2. All or part of the resources required to establish an organic capability that will
       not be available until after operational support is first required. In this case, the system
       development, production, and deployment phases do not allow enough time to develop
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                         53


     the support resources before organic support is needed (e.g., automatic test equipment
     development that generally lags behind the development of the system which it supports).
         4.19.1.2.1. Under no circumstances is ICS to be interpreted as a means of
         compensating for a budget cut or any other unforeseen situation that may require the
         use of contract support. ICS must be planned budget lead-time away and have been
         subjected to rigorous cost and risk analysis.
         4.19.1.2.2. ICS is not used to replace the requirement for testing and for fully
         demonstrating the adequacy of a new design for an acquisition or modification
         program before making a major deployment commitment. Instead, it is a method of
         controlling capital investment in logistics support while refining the requirements,
         resolving the technical problems, achieving design stability, and compensating for
         lead-time for complex support resource development.
         4.19.1.2.3. ICS is predominately a depot level program because sound program
         management normally demands organic capability for the performance of all
         organizational and intermediate (O&I) level tasks when operational systems are
         initially delivered. Inclusion of O&I tasks under ICS should be accomplished only on
         an exception basis.
  4.19.2. Contractor Logistics Support (CLS). Funding responsibilities are as follows:
     4.19.2.1. Operating commands will budget CLS for their weapon systems. Use EEIC 578
     to identify costs.
     4.19.2.2. For systems that are not weapon system specific (for example, Base and
     Installation Security System), the operating command that has the closest relationship
     and/or receives the most benefit has budgeting responsibility. If there is no clear
     relationship to any one operating command or no one command receives more benefit
     than the others, AFMC will retain budgeting and programming responsibility.
     4.19.2.3. AFMC will budget and program for classified programs managed by HQ
     AFMC/AZ.
     4.19.2.4. AFMC System Program Managers (SPM) are responsible for managing CLS
     contracts. Operating commands are responsible for budget execution and will establish
     OBANS for AFMC Air Logistics Center contractor logistics support efforts. AFMC
     SPMs will assist operating commands in developing and costing CLS requirements.
     4.19.2.5. When a system transitions from organic logistics support to CLS, the operating
     command will program enough resources to fund those system spares which are in the
     stock fund inventory and are to be transferred to the CLS contractor.
  4.19.3. Appropriations Chargeable. Determine the type of funds that will be used based
  on the type of contract, or services and items provided under the contract. Maybe more than
  one appropriation, budget program activity code (BPAC), or element of expense (EEIC) will
  be involved with one program. The following are examples:
     4.19.3.1. If the contract is written to provide strictly a maintenance service (time and
     effort), charge the cost to an operating account, for example, O&M Air Force (except for
     DT&E or IOT&E). Contracts could require the contractor to provide all spares, repair
     parts, labor, and test equipment.
 54                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       4.19.3.2. If the contract calls for the government to purchase and furnish the spares,
       repair parts, or equipment, including test equipment, then you may need to use more than
       one appropriation, BPAC, and EEIC.
       4.19.3.3. Use the appropriate procurement/RDT&E appropriation to pay the cost if
       capital investment items (peculiar support or test equipment) centrally managed items,
       and/or data are furnished to the contractor.
       4.19.3.4. Use O&M (EEIC 579 in the case of ICS) for the maintenance service part of
       the contract.
       4.19.3.5. Charge an operating account (EEIC 605 or 609 from the DWCF, EEIC 619 if
       from other) if the government furnishes the supply parts (expense type items) used in
       maintenance.
4.20. Determining the Funds Chargeable. Specific funding guidance cannot cover all
contracts or situations; therefore, the system manager, with assistance from and advice of the
MAJCOM FM organization, must take the following actions for each proposed contractual
action:
   4.20.1. Review each contract with maintenance and procurement personnel to determine the
   type of service or product that is being procured.
   4.20.2. Determine the proper appropriation and BPAC to use per AFMAN 65-604.
   4.20.3. Refer questions that can't be resolved at the command level by the MAJCOM FM
   organization to SAF/FMBM for decision. Provide your analysis and recommendations when
   referring a funding (propriety or responsibility) question to SAF/FMBM.

Section 4H—Prompt Payment Act (P.L. 97177 and 5CFR Part 1315

4.21. Financing Prompt Payment Charges:
   4.21.1. Federal departments and agencies must absorb interest penalties within existing
   appropriations. For DFAS paying offices supporting Air Force sites, the interest will be
   financed by the operating funds of the base being supported without regard to who caused the
   late payment.
   4.21.2. Use only three appropriations to finance expenses for prompt payment--Air Force
   O&M (57*3400), Air Force Management and Support RDT&E (57*3600), and Air Force
   Reserves O&M (57*3740).
   4.21.3. On a case-by-case exception, host installations may charge the penalty to tenant
   O&M funds or DWCF only when evidence clearly exists that the tenant or DWCF was
   directly responsible for the incurrence of the interest penalty. If the host and tenant cannot
   agree on the tenant’s liability for the penalty charge, the host installation Commander, with
   advice from his or her Comptroller, will make the final determination based on the facts of
   the individual case.
   4.21.4. When non-Air Force paying offices (Army, Navy, Marines, DoD, etc.), not
   supporting Air Force sites, administer or pay Air Force contracts and incur prompt payment
   penalties, charge the interest payments to those activities without subsequent recoupment
   from the Air Force. For DFAS paying offices, not supporting Air Force sites, that administer
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             55


   or pay contracts citing Air Force funds, charge the incurred interest payments to the
   operating funds of the base being supported without regard to who caused the late payment.
   EXCEPTION: Interest paid on Air Force contracts by DFAS-CO are charged to a MIPR
   provided to DFAS-CO by the 11th Wing on behalf of SAF/FM.
   4.21.5. For Foreign Military Sales (FMS), the following fund cite is authorized for charging
   all Air Force FMS PPA interest penalty payments: 97-11X8242.0002 4F 8467 NP0239 00*
   S843055 (The * is where the one-digit reason code is placed.) Expenditure authority (EA) is
   not required when using this fund cite (DSCA Jan 27, 1998 Memorandum, Subject: Line of
   Accounting for Prompt Payment Act Interest and DFAS-DE/AYC Msg. 121352Z Oct 01.
   4.21.6. Nonappropriated funds (NAF) paying offices or activities will charge interest penalty
   costs to NAFs.
   4.21.7. See DFAS-DE 7010.2-R for specific accounting instructions.
4.22. Assigning Data Elements:
   4.22.1. All Air Force paying activities will use base-wide cost center XX88XX (see DFAS-
   DER 7000.1). In the Air Force O&M Appropriation (57*3400) this cost center is linked to
   XXX96F program elements. The Air Force RDT&E program elements are 65806F and
   65807F. For AFRC O&M (57*3740), Dobbins AFB GA only, the base-wide cost center uses
   program element 55396F.
   4.22.2. Use element of expense/investment code (EEIC) 682 for all three Air Force
   appropriations. This EEIC reflects only prompt payment interest penalty costs. Use fourth-
   and fifth-position EEIC code shreds for EEIC 682XX as follows (see the Air Force Corporate
   Data Dictionary, Volume I for definitions):
       4.22.2.1. Use the fourth-position numeric shred of EEIC 682 to reflect the reason a
       prompt payment interest penalty was incurred.
       4.22.2.2. Use the fifth-position alpha-code shred of EEIC 682 to reflect the original
       appropriation cited on the voucher that incurred an interest penalty payment. Where more
       than one appropriation is cited on the contract, use the predominancy rule to determine
       the fifth-position shred. The appropriation with the most dollars dictates the alpha shred
       selected. (An exception to the guidance is for FMS-related fund cites. Because these are
       reimbursable-type transactions, use a prorated breakdown between the appropriations
       based on dollar value to total contract costs to distribute EEIC 682 interest penalties to
       the proper fifth-position alpha shreds.)

Section 4I—Telephone System Costs

4.23. Funding Advance Deposits for Installation Costs of Telephone Cable Required for
New Family Housing. Installations responsible for installing telephone cabling for new family
housing will comply with the following guidance:
   4.23.1. Charge the costs of trenching, backfilling, and paving associated with cable
   installation both within a new residential subdivision and within the 100 foot allowance to
   the appropriate construction appropriation.
 56                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   4.23.2. Charge the payment of deposits against the cost of installing underground telephone
   equipment specifically required to service a new subdivision to the appropriation financing
   the host-base operation.
   4.23.3. Credit the appropriation financing the host-base operation for refunds of the deposits
   against the cost of installing underground telephone equipment specifically required to
   service a new subdivision. (Refunds of the deposits are provided in the form of setoffs or
   credits against bills to the Air Force for services.)
4.24. Funding Other Telephone Activities:
   4.24.1. Paying for Telephone Reconnection Charges. The Base Civil Engineer (BCE) and
   Chief of Services may approve appropriated fund payment for telephone reconnection fees
   which result from base actions for the convenience of the Air Force (only for local, non-PCS
   moves)(EEIC 592). These entitlements are usually due to either a mandatory assignment to
   government housing facilities or the termination of assignment to quarters due to death of
   qualifying dependents.
   4.24.2. Providing Telephones for Government Transient Facilities. Air Force installations
   may spend appropriated funds for telephone service and equipment in transient quarters when
   sufficient official need exists for a telephone (AFI 33-111). Host MAJCOMs must establish
   controls to make sure appropriated funds are not used to pay for unofficial toll calls. The host
   MAJCOM must establish procedures for billing to transient residents when direct toll calling
   is allowed.
   4.24.3. Paying for Commercial "Unofficial" Telephone Service. This paragraph, along
   with Figure 4.2, describes funding procedures for acquiring, installing, and maintaining
   inside wiring used to provide commercial "unofficial" telephone service in facilities such as
   dormitories, military family housing, VAQs, VOQs, TLFs, etc. This funding guidance refers
   to the inside wiring that extends between the telephone company's point of demarcation at a
   facility and the subscriber's telephone outlet.
      4.24.3.1. Assigning Funding Responsibilities:
          4.24.3.1.1. Pay for the installation and maintenance of inside wiring in Air Force
          quarters with the appropriation that finances the construction, repair, or maintenance
          of government quarters.
          4.24.3.1.2. In facilities other than Air Force quarters, the subscriber pays for the
          installation and maintenance, regardless of who owns the facility.
              4.24.3.1.2.1. The subscriber pays for all costs associated with the service
              provided by the telephone company (for example, circuit activation fees, monthly
              access fees, toll calls, long haul carrier access fees, instrument rental or
              procurement, etc.).
              4.24.3.1.2.2. See Figure 4.2 of this instruction and AFI 33-111 for further
              procedures and instructions. AFI 33-111 contains guidelines for both "official"
              and "unofficial" telephone service.
   4.24.4. Financing Telephone Wiring and Cable TV Wiring:
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             57


     4.24.4.1. Use Military Family Housing (MFH) P722 maintenance funds to finance the
     maintenance, repair, and minor alteration requirements for telephone wiring within MFH
     units.
     4.24.4.2. The occupant pays for the provision and installation of the telephone
     instrument and for the relocation of outlets solely for the convenience of the occupant.
     4.24.4.3. Installations must use MFH funds (P71X/P72X) to pay for cable TV prewiring
     as part of housing unit construction or improvement of units where cable TV is, or will be
     available.
  4.24.5. Providing Command and Control Communications Services in Base Housing.
     4.24.5.1. Official telephone service in the form of direct lines to the base switchboard
     (NOTE: For this purpose, a direct line from the appropriate operational command post is
     an acceptable alternative) or Class C phone lines in personal quarters is authorized per
     AFI 33-111, Telephone Systems Management, only for those individuals in ―positions
     requiring immediate communications response for command and control.‖ Class A
     telephone service that provides local off-base or commercial long distance telephone
     service is not authorized. Telephone service may be authorized for on-base and Defense
     Information Systems Network (DSN) communications (given a mission essential need)
     when appropriate. Written authorization for such service must be kept on file for the
     duration of the service by the activity that provides the service. Except for alternate work
     sites (covered in P.L. 104-52, Title IV, Sec. 620, 19 Nov 95, Treasury, Postal Service,
     and General Government Appropriations Act of 1996 and AFI 33-111, paragraph 7.2.),
     appropriated funds are not authorized to provide telephone service in personal quarters
     where there is no clearly established requirement for immediate command and control
     capability. Personal need or convenience alone does not meet command and control
     criteria.
     4.24.5.2. The access requirement cannot be granted solely on the basis of grade or rank.
     Individuals authorized official telephone service in their private (on-base) residence must
     have both a functional and immediate need for command and control access.
     4.24.5.3. Appropriated funds may be used to provide LAN services to private (on-base)
     residences when there is a command and control need for these services. Establishing a
     requirement for immediate command and control capability is applicable before
     providing access to an installation local area net (LAN) in a private (on-base)
     residence. These LAN services can be used for official business only. The cost of fiber
     cable installation in the MFH unit is chargeable to the Military Family Housing (MFH)
     O&M Appropriation. Additional guidance on LAN services is provided in AFI 33-129,
     Communications and Information Transmission of Information via Internet.
  4.24.6. Flexiplace/Telecommunicating Support to Alternate Work Sites. P.L 104-52,
  Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1996, Sec. 620
  provides that appropriated funds may be used to install telephone lines and necessary
  equipment and to pay monthly charges in any private residence or private apartment of an
  employee who is authorized to work at home in accordance with guidelines issued by the
  Office of Personnel Management (OPM): Provided that the head of the department, division,
  bureau, or office certifies that adequate safeguards against private misuse exist and that the
 58                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   service is necessary for direct support of the agency’s mission. Additional guidance may be
   found in AFI 33-111.

1.     The cost of construction includes telephone wiring, jacks, terminal blocks, etc., so as to
make the facility telephone ready. Construction does not include instrument rental-procurement
or any charges levied by the telephone company associated with activating the telephone circuit
or providing the telephone service to the subscriber. The subscriber is responsible for these
charges in all cases. AF prewiring guidance, ETL 02-12, requires the installation of inside
wiring using Military Construction Program (3300 appropriation) funds, either new construction
or major renovation.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              59


2.     Prewiring does not apply to AF funded minor construction (57*3400, EEIC 529).
However, as a minimum, provisions for communications wiring and equipment (conduit, space,
plywood backboards, etc.) are provided as part of the project. In these cases, physical spaces are
a part of the funded cost (EEIC 529); conduit, plywood backboards, etc., are treated as
secondary utilities per AFR 86-1 and are an unfunded cost (EEIC 592). Communications wiring
may be installed as part of the project, consistent with the general guidelines of ETL 87-XX, but
are funded as an expense (57*3400, EEIC 592).
3. For MFH units, pay for minor renovations costing $2,000 or less with P-722. Pay for minor
renovations costing over $2,000 with P-713.
4. AFI 33-111 has guidelines for the authorization and funding of Class A, B, C, and D
"official" telephone service.
5. Follow the funding guidance above when using appropriated                      funds. Follow
nonappropriated funding guidance when using nonappropriated funds.

Section 4J—USAF Museum Program

4.25. USAF Museum Programs. AFI 84-103 provides instruction for the Air Force museum
program, museum operation, and new museum approval.
   4.25.1. Financing the United States Air Force Museum (USAFM). The USAFM at
   Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, is the only museum eligible to receive appropriated funds for
   new construction and O&M funds from the Service-wide Activities of Budget Activity 04.
   4.25.2. Financing Air Force Base Museums:
       4.25.2.1. The Air Force encourages but does not require a foundation in the
       establishment and operation of a museum. Where a foundation exists, the supporting Air
       Force installation should use its resources and other voluntary funds for construction,
       establishment, management, operation, and maintenance of the supported museums.
       Establish a memorandum of understanding between the parties to outline the
       responsibilities and limitations for each party, including a general description of those
       areas where the foundation will assist the museum.
       4.25.2.2. When foundation funds are inadequate, installation commanders may use
       O&M-type funds to support the base museum, provided the costs are reasonable and in
       line with the base mission and funding priorities. Museum buildings are not privately
       owned, but are owned and maintained by the Air Force. The buildings and grounds
       should be maintained in the same manner as other buildings on the base. Repair and
       maintenance of the building, parking lots, and landscaping are normal BOS support. For
       example, if museum parking becomes congested and requires an enlargement of the
       museum parking lot, this requirement is not a museum-unique problem, but a base
       requirement that must compete against other base improvement projects for funding and
       comply with the base comprehensive plans. The installation of intrusion detection
       systems is permitted because it is part of the base requirement to provide security. Use
       O&M funds from your Budget Activity for base support; however, don’t use O&M or
       MILCON for museum construction, additions, or alterations.
 60                                                 AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       4.25.2.3. O&M-type funds may be used for the following purposes: minor construction
       with a limit of $2,500 per individual interior work project.
   4.25.3. Financing Air Force Exhibits and Air Parks. Installation commanders may
   authorize the use of O&M funds for these activities following the guidance in paragraph
   4.25.2.

Section 4K—Ethnic and Holiday Observances, Traditional Ceremonies, and Entertainment

4.26. Ethnic and Holiday Observances Funding Guidance:
   4.26.1. Ethnic Observances. Air Force organizations at all levels may spend appropriated
   funds, as authorized by the host or installation commander, to carry out activities that
   recognize the contributions that minorities and women have made to society. Observances
   include such activities as scholarly lectures, ethnic historical exhibits, art exhibits, displays,
   and musical groups, including those procured from the private sector.
       4.26.1.1. Air Force organizations may use O&M-type funds to finance a live artistic
       performance as an authorized part of an equal employment opportunity (EEO) effort if it
       is part of a formal program determined to advance EEO objectives, and consists of
       different types of presentations designed to promote EEO training objectives of making
       the audience aware of the cultural or ethnic history being celebrated (60 Comp Gen 303).
       While the Air Force may not normally provide "free food" to either government or non-
       government personnel, federal agencies may pay for lunches for guest speakers under 5
       U.S.C. 5703 if the speakers were in fact away from their homes or regular places of
       business. (NOTE: government employees must pay for their own meals, whether on
       TDY or not, because food is a personal expense.)
       4.26.1.2. Sponsoring Air Force activities may use appropriated funds to purchase small
       "samples" of ethnic foods prepared and served during a formal ethnic awareness program.
       The samples should be of minimal proportion and are not intended to serve as meals or
       refreshments.
   4.26.2. Holiday Observances. Installation Commanders may approve the use of
   appropriated funds (APFs) to purchase seasonal decorations on a case by case basis. Be
   prudent when using APFs for this purpose. The following conditions apply. Purchase
   decorations only where all installation personnel may benefit from their use, e.g., a decorated
   Headquarters building, base Christmas tree, or decorated foyer of the Headquarters building.
   Do not use APFs to purchase decorations for the interior of government offices or for
   personal use. The decorations may not be religious in character. Also, do not use APFs to
   purchase or mail seasonal greeting cards.
4.27. Traditional Ceremonies. The use of appropriated funds that might be prohibited, as
personal expenses may be permissible when they are incurred incident to certain traditional
ceremonies. Don't provide free food, snacks, alcoholic beverages, etc., except as provided in
paragraph 4.28. Comptroller General decisions permit the commercial printing, including
DAPS, of invitations and programs only for the following traditional ceremonies, which do not
include retirements, unless performed concurrently with a formal Change of Command
ceremony:
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              61


  4.27.1. Groundbreaking and Dedication Ceremonies. Expenses necessarily incident to a
  groundbreaking or cornerstone ceremony are chargeable to the appropriation used for
  construction of the building. These expenses include: engraving and chrome-plating a
  ceremonial shovel (53 CG 119); flowers used as centerpieces at a dedication ceremony
  (B158831, 8 Jun 1966); group photographs at cornerstone ceremonies (B-11884, 26 Aug
  1940); and the printing of programs and invitations for cornerstone ceremonies (B-158831, 8
  Jun 1966, and B-107165-0.M, 3 Apr 1982).
  4.27.2. Armed Forces Change of Command Ceremonies. The Comptroller General
  extended the rationale of the cases cited above to Change of Command ceremonies for the
  cost of printing invitations (56 CG 81). The invitations are not inherently personal in nature,
  and therefore are not prohibited by the decisions on use of public funds for greeting cards. A
  Change of Command ceremony on an Air Force installation, which would warrant the
  commercial printing of invitations, including DAPS, is one which would be of interest to and
  have impact on the installation at large and usually involve the civic leaders of the
  surrounding community. Generally, the only command position on an installation which
  would fit this criteria is the Wing/Installation Commander. It is not intended that every unit
  commander, i.e. transportation, personnel, civil engineer, comptroller, etc., on an installation
  has commercial invitations, including DAPS, printed when he or she leaves the position.
  4.27.3. Graduations. The Comptroller General (CompGen Decision B-211700, March 16,
  1984) authorized the printing of invitations for graduation ceremonies at the Uniformed
  Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). Invitations for official graduation
  ceremonies at Air Force schools and academies are not to be “by name” specific invitations
  for an individual who may be graduating. The announcement and invitation are for the
  commencement exercises being held by the school, not for the graduation of a particular
  individual. A graduate may include his or her personal name card in the invitation when
  mailing it to family or friends, but their name is not to appear in the printed invitation or
  announcement.
  4.27.4. Retirement Ceremonies. Military and federal civilian employee retirement
  ceremonies provide an appropriate recognition of the individual retiree’s contribution to the
  Air Force through years of military or federal civilian employee service. Appropriated funds
  may be used for the following.
     4.27.4.1. Transportation. See paragraph 10.2.10 for TDY travel to officiate or
     participate at retirement ceremonies. Government vehicles are not generally authorized
     for the transportation of the retiree or guest unless the retiree is an individual who is
     authorized to use a government vehicle as part of their official duties, for example a wing
     commander. If the retiree is not such a person, then providing a government vehicle
     solely or even principally to enhance the comfort or convenience of the member(s) is not
     permitted (see AFI 24-301, paragraph 2.1).
     4.27.4.2. Invitations. Invitations, announcements, and programs for retirement
     ceremonies may be printed on personal computers with existing computer software and
     agency-purchased card stock, but not procured from commercial sources, including
     DAPS.
     4.27.4.3. Personnel. Non-protocol Air Force civilian and military members may
     consolidate address lists, address and stuff envelopes, mail retirement invitations, plan a
 62                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       retirement event, escort guests and setup and/or serve refreshments after the ceremony. A
       rule of reasonableness is expected to be followed and these activities should not be the
       military members’ or employees’ primary duties for an extended period of time. Military
       and civilian personnel may attend retirement ceremonies during duty hours, provided
       their supervisor authorizes such attendance, it is for a reasonable period of time, and it
       does not unduly interfere with performance of normal duties. Local Air Force Band
       members, Air Force Honor Guard members, and communications personnel may be used
       in duty status as part of the ceremony.
       4.27.4.4. Postage. APF postage is allowed for official announcements of official
       retirement ceremonies (see DoD 4525.8-M, Official Mail Manual). A rule of
       reasonableness is expected to be followed as to the number of invitations that can be
       mailed.
   4.27.5. Wreath Laying - National Patriotic Observances. APFs are authorized for the
   purchase of an appropriate wreath in solemn remembrance or celebration of national patriotic
   observances to include Memorial Day, Independence Day, September 11, Veterans Day, and
   POW/MIA Recognition Day. There is to be only one wreath procured representing the
   entire Wing or Installation, including tenants, and not one purchased by each host and
   tenant organization. There are specific days at specific locations, i.e. December 7 at
   Hickam AFB, HI, which have singularly historical significance and for which it is fitting and
   proper to remember the events of that day with the laying of a wreath. Those installations in
   foreign countries may purchase a wreath on other occasions, which are of singularly
   historical significance to the Armed Forces of the United States in that country or which are
   dictated by protocol in the host country. Fiscal prudence, in keeping with protocol
   requirements and appropriate decorum, shall be exercised.
4.28. Entertainment. You can’t provide food, drink, or entertainment for military members,
civilian employees, or any other persons, except in cases specifically authorized by law. The
Comptroller General defines entertainment as ―food, drink, live and recorded music, theatrical
performances, and any other item or activity designed to entertain.‖ Authorized and unauthorized
―entertainment‖ situations payable from appropriated funds are shown below. Prohibitions
include items used to prepare, serve, or present entertainment (such as food or drink serving
materials and equipment, loudspeakers, video recorders, etc.).
   4.28.1. Use appropriated funds for these expenses:
       4.28.1.1. Food and drink provided to military personnel as subsistence-in-kind through
       the Military Personnel Appropriation (57*3500).
       4.28.1.2. Reimbursable subsistence expenses (per diem) for persons in an official travel
       status.
       4.28.1.3. Appropriated contingency funds for official representation purposes, as
       authorized in AFI 65-603.
       4.28.1.4. Ethnic food samples, bands, or singing groups used in authorized ethnic
       awareness programs, per Section 4K of this chapter.
       4.28.1.5. Light refreshments at awards ceremonies as described in Section 4L of this
       chapter.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               63


       4.28.1.6. Samples of food from healthy cooking demonstration held in conjunction with
       health promotion programs (funded with DHP 97X/X0130.1883 – FC 2X).
       4.28.1.7. Light food and refreshments at arms control treaty inspection briefings.
       4.28.1.8. Military service bands, choral groups, and other groups (such as ―Tops in
       Blue‖) which normally perform at base theaters or service clubs for the entertainment of
       military personnel, their dependents, and others as authorized by the charter of the bands
       or choral groups. Rental of a local facility using O&M funds is authorized for Air Force
       entertainment such as Tops in Blue or a military service band if the majority of the
       anticipated audience will be military and their dependents (including retirees) and no
       suitable facility is available on the installation.
       4.28.1.9. Programmed ―incentive music‖ (such as ―MUSAK‖) to enhance employee
       morale by creating a pleasantly stimulating and efficient atmosphere during the workday.
       (See 51 CG 797.)
       4.28.1.10. Food provided as part of the Drug Education for Youth (DEFY) Program and
       financed with Counter Drug Program funds.
       4.28.1.11. See paragraph 4.42.1.1 for guidance on refreshments at conferences and
       symposiums.
   4.28.2. Don’t use appropriated funds for these:
       4.28.2.1. Dance or combos created by members of military bands whose services are
       ―hired‖ by Open Messes or Service Clubs for entertainment of members of these messes
       or clubs.
       4.28.2.2. Fireworks displays because they constitute ―entertainment‖. While a fireworks
       display may be useful in establishing good relations with the surrounding community, it
       is not a ―necessary expense.‖ (See CG B-205292, 2 Jun 1982.)

Section 4L—Awards, Award Ceremonies and Gifts

4.29. Awards and Gifts. Do not use appropriated funds to purchase gifts for military members,
employees, or private citizens unless specifically authorized by law. Currently, the only authority
to use Air Force appropriated funds for gifts is AFI 65-603, which specifies the circumstances
and the individuals to whom gifts (or ―mementos‖) may be presented. Commanders may
authorize the use of appropriated funds to make cash and non-monetary awards to military
members and appropriated fund employees in accordance with the provisions of this section,
AFPD 36-28 and its implementing instructions, and AFI 36-1004 for civilian performance
awards. Employees paid from nonappropriated funds are not eligible to receive awards charged
to appropriated funds, with one exception. That exception would be a HQ USAF-level award,
funded with APF, for which APF and NAF employees are competing for that single award.
   4.29.1. Innovative Development Through Employee Awareness (IDEA) Awards. The
   following guidelines apply to cash awards to military and civilian employees:
       4.29.1.1. Air Force Personnel. The Air Force organization (active or reserve forces) to
       which a member or employee is assigned is responsible for budgeting and funding of
       IDEA awards, including tenant units that are separately funded. Funding of suggestion
64                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


     awards made after an individual is transferred or separated is the responsibility of the
     organization of assignment when the IDEA was submitted.. Use the O&M-type funds of
     the organization to which the individual is or was assigned. When this applies to a
     Reservist transferring between AFRC bases, follow AFRC guidance for funding rules.
     For Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs), the unit of assignment is the activity
     where the individual performs his/her IMA duty.
     4.29.1.2. NonAir Force Personnel. If the Air Force adopts a suggestion from a person
     in another DoD or federal agency, charge the cash award to the O&M type funds of (a)
     SAF/AA if the IDEA benefits the Air Force as a whole, or (b) the command or
     organization that receives the primary benefit.
  4.29.2. Mission Accomplishment Awards. Air Force activities may use appropriated funds
  to purchase special trophies and awards authorized by those AFI 36-XXXX series
  instructions which pertain to mission accomplishment, or a MAJCOM/Base/FOA/DRU
  supplement thereto. Included are trophies, plaques, emblems, certificates, organizational
  coins, and similar items that are designed for display purposes. For organizational coins, do
  not personalize them by stamping the presenter’s name on the coin and the presenter’s name
  is not to be added after the coin is cast (EXCEPTION: Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of
  Staff of the Air Force, Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, four (4) star general officers
  and four (4) star civilian equivalents are authorized to personalize coins). The coins are
  to be presented as cast from the die without further embellishment, i.e. presenter’s name
  engraved. They are organizational coins, not personalized mementos. Use only the
  organization’s name and the position of the presenter (e.g. Commander 333FW Luke AFB,
  AZ). The prohibition against personalizing stationary in AF Supplement to DoDD 5330.3,
  DAPS, is applicable to organizational coins for the same reasons – it creates frozen stock
  (waste) when personnel change and requires an additional expenditure to change the die from
  which these items are cast. Appropriated funds are not legally available to procure
  “commemorative” coins. Merchandise items such as jackets or belt buckles with a nominal
  cost, as determined by local Command authorities, and which display the activity logo,
  insignia or other inscription that clearly identifies its purpose meet Comptroller General
  criteria for mission accomplishment awards. Air Force activities may use such items for
  mission accomplishment awards to the extent authorized by agency directives or instructions.
  The authority for merchandise-type items for mission accomplishment awards for civilians is
  5 U.S.C. 4501-4507 (see Comptroller General Decision B-243025) and for military, 10
  U.S.C. 1125 (see Comptroller General Decision B-247687).
  4.29.2. (341MW) 4 (Added) Privately-Funded Coins.
     4.29.2.1. Coins for Reenlistment. To highlight the importance of reenlistment to the
     Air Force mission and the commitment of the member to that mission, the same coins
     used for mission accomplishment awards, addressed in paragraph 4.29.2 above, may be
     presented to members reenlisting.
     4.29.2.2. (Added-341MW) 341 MW Recognition and Appreciation Coin.
         4.29.2.2.1. (Added-341MW) The 341 MW Commander’s coin will be presented by
         the Commander, Vice Commander or Command Chief Master Sergeant to assigned
         military and civilian employees, who, by their dedicated individual effort, have
         facilitated the successful accomplishment of a particular program, function, task, or
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                65


        mission. The 341 MW Command Chief Master Sergeant’s coin will be presented by
        the 341 MW Command Chief Master Sergeant.
        4.29.2.2.2. (Added-341MW) Coins may not be used as personal or commemorative
        gifts, souvenirs, tokens of exchange in games, or as morale-builders unrelated to
        special achievements.
        4.29.2.2.3. (Added-341MW) Coins may not be given to non-appropriated funds
        employees or used as tokens of appreciation for government officials, foreign
        officials or non-Federal personnel in recognition of general support or improved
        community relations.
     4.29.2.3. (Added-341MW) Group and Squadron Level Recognition and
     Appreciation Coin. Group and squadron commanders are authorized one coin award
     program per each group and squadron. Units below squadron level are not authorized a
     coin award program.
        4.29.2.3.1. (Added-341MW) The Group or squadron coin will be presented by the
        Commander or appropriate designee to assigned military and civilian employees,
        who, by their dedicated individual effort, have facilitated the successful
        accomplishment of a particular program, function, task, or mission.
        4.29.2.3.2. (Added-341MW) All guidelines and limitations in paragraphs
        4.29.2.2.2(Added) and 4.29.2.2.3 (Added) apply to group/squadron coin programs.
        4.29.2.3.3. (Added-341MW) Coins will be unit funded and a recipient log will be
        maintained. The log will at a minimum record the name, date, and accomplishment
        recognized. The coins will be inventoried by a disinterested party no less than
        annually.
        4.29.2.3.4. (Added-341MW) Prior to implementing a coin award program,
        groups/squadrons must coordinate and approve a unit-level policy directive
        (instruction, policy letter, etc.) that establishes and details their specific program if it
        deviates from this guidance.
     4.29.2.4. (Added-341MW) Privately-Funded Coins.
        4.29.2.4.1. (Added-341MW) Coins purchased with personal or private funds do not
        fall under the limitations of this supplement.
  4.29.3. Promotional or Incentive Gifts and Awards:
     4.29.3.1. Items of a utilitarian nature, having intrinsic value, such as TVs, radios,
     cameras, briefcases, etc., fall into the category of merchandise. The Comptroller General
     considers them as personal gifts. Existing statutes do not permit the purchase of such
     items with appropriated funds for use as incentives. This rule also applies to lowervalue
     ―merchandisetype‖ items, such as coffee mugs, key chains, ashtrays, luggage tags and
     similar items. (See paragraphs 4.29.2 for exceptions). Additionally, there is no authority
     which allows the use of appropriated funds to procure mementos, i.e., coins or
     medallions, for Air Force individual military or civilian personnel or units if the reason
     for the presentation is not specifically addressed as a mission accomplishment award
     published in the Command or Base supplements to AFI 36-XXXX. However, Air Force
     activities may purchase pertinent literature, specialized lesson plans, bumper stickers,
 66                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


      informational stickers (for tools, telephones, notebooks, and so on), visual aids for
      training and to secure compliance with mission-related objectives, to the extent permitted
      under functional instructions. Where children are concerned, for example, in crime and
      fire prevention programs, these guidelines allow purchase of items that convey an
      appropriate message targeted to the age group of the audience (such as coloring books,
      balloons, buttons, badges, etc., which depict or relate a crime or fire prevention message).
      4.29.3.2. The guidance in paragraph 4.29.3.1 does not apply to the Air Force IDEA
      Program, the Air Force Productivity Enhancement Program, the Air Force Recruiting
      Advertising Program, the Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and the Air Force
      Pollution Prevention Program. AFI 38-401 (Air Force IDEA Program), AFI 38-301 (Air
      Force Productivity Improvement Program), AFI 36-2015 (Air Force Recruiting
      Advertising Program), Air Force Retention Program (AFI 36-2624 Career Assistance
      Advisors), AFI 91-202 (Air Force Mishap Prevention Program}, Family Support Centers
      (AFI 36-3009 & Supporting Role in 10 U.S.C. 1789) provide instructions for these
      programs. Additionally, the guidance does not apply to Health Promotion Programs
      funded with the Defense Health Program (DHP) appropriation (97X/X0130.1883 -
      FC 2X).
   4.29.4. Sports Competitions. Activities may use appropriated funds to purchase T-shirts,
   trophies, plaques or similar devices for presentation to winners of intramural sports and
   athletic competitions. Such competitions shall generally be of a continuing nature. T-shirts
   can be used in lieu of other awards and cannot be used in conjunction with any plaque,
   medal/medallion, trophy or similar device. No other type of shirt is authorized. Awards,
   including T-shirts, may be given to winners only and not participants in general. The
   trophies, plaques, or similar devices shall be for display purposes only, and not redeemable
   for cash, merchandise, or services. (See DoD Directive 1348.19, 12 May 1989.)
   4.29.5. Physical Fitness Centers. O&M-type funds may be used to procure low cost
   incentive items such as T-shirts, ball caps, water bottles, etc. to encourage customers to
   complete specified and published exercise regimens at Air Force Physical Fitness Centers.
   Examples of such regimens could be jogging a set number of miles or so many hours on a
   stairmaster or rowing machine. There is no authority for cash awards or high dollar items that
   would give the appearance of a gift or fiscal imprudence. The unit cost of any incentive item
   will not exceed $10 dollars. Because of the high cost of a die, coins or medallions are not to
   be used as incentive items. The authority for this incentive program is a 25 Jan 99 Policy
   Memorandum from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy
   (ASD/FMP).
   4.29.6. Health and Wellness Centers (HAWCs). Incentive items for completion of a
   health-related regimen such as smoking cessation or weight loss are funded from Medical
   appropriations (Fund Code 2X). For AFRC, use O&M (3740).
   4.29.7. Other Awards. Do not use appropriated funds to make or purchase any awards
   other than those outlined above. Use nonappropriated funds in accordance with AFI 34-201
   (currently in rewrite to be reissued as AFI 34-403, Use of Nonappropriated Funds).
4.30. Civilian Performance Awards. AFI 36-1001 and AFI 36-1004 provide policy and
guidelines:
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                67


   4.30.1. Charge the cost of cash awards made to civilian employees under the merit pay
   system to funds current at the time final approval of the award is made. The year of actual
   payment is not the controlling factor.
   4.30.2. AFI 36-1004 allows agencies to purchase merchandise items such as jackets at
   nominal cost (less than $50) which display the activity logo, insignia, or other inscription that
   clearly identifies the purpose of the award. Such items are honorary awards under the
   Government Employees Incentive Awards Act (CG Decision B-243025).
4.31. Refreshments at Awards Ceremonies. Commanders may hold awards ceremonies for
military members and civilian employees, including their families, friends, work associates, and
union representatives (See CG Decision B-223319, 21 July 1986 which addresses a national
award ceremony). While light refreshments may be served, the CompGen Decision implies that
the award being presented must be substantial in nature to qualify for the serving of
refreshments. A substantial award would involve a competitive USAF-wide selection (national
award), such as 12 Outstanding Airmen, or a competitive Command-wide selection (regional
award), such as Command Officer, NCO, Airman, and Civilian of the Year. To avoid any
confusion, presenting an award at a base or organization picnic does not qualify the picnic
for APF funding under the guise of an award “ceremony.” PCS, promotion, school
graduations, recurring quarterly recognitions, commanders’ call, and retirement ceremonies are
not considered award ceremonies for the serving of refreshments using appropriated funds.
   4.31.1. Civilian Employees. Appropriated funds may be used to provide light refreshments
   at such award ceremonies at nominal cost under authority of 5 U.S.C. 4503. AFI 36-1004
   provides guidance on the Air Force recognition program. See also CG Decision B223319, 21
   July 1986 (National Award Ceremony), and CG Decision B-236040, 9 October 1990
   (Regional Award Ceremony). As indicated by the CG Decisions, the award must be
   substantial in nature, as opposed to local awards. The presentation of a longevity
   certificate and pin is not considered an award.
       4.31.1.1. Nonappropriated funds finance the cost of light refreshments for personnel paid
       from nonappropriated funds.
       4.31.1.2. Commanders may pay fees charged for a regional or national incentive
       awards ceremony that includes refreshments (luncheon, banquet, buffet, tea, etc.) for
       attending civilian employee nominees, award recipients, and their supervisors or
       managers.
   4.31.2. Military Personnel. Similar authority exists under 10 U.S.C. 1124 for military
   personnel.
   4.31.3. Examples. Light refreshments may include beverages such as sodas, coffee, or tea
   with dessert or snacks, luncheons, and buffets. Alcoholic beverages of any kind do not
   qualify as refreshments.
   4.31.4. Guidance for Approval. Exercise prudence in using appropriated funds for this
   purpose. A commander must first determine that a reception with light refreshments, in
   accordance with OPM regulations and 10 U.S.C. 1124, will materially enhance the
   effectiveness of an award ceremony before approving the use of appropriated funds for
   refreshments at the ceremony. Charge the cost of the light refreshments to each command’s
   primary O&M budget activity and not to Official Representation Fund accounts. (NOTE: CG
 68                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   Decision B-223319, 21 Jul 86 covers only those award ceremonies resulting from
   competitive-type activities cited in AFPD 36-28 and its instructions and the Federal
   Personnel Manual. It does not cover PCS departure or retirement ceremonies except to the
   extent applicable awards are an integral part of the ceremony.)
   4.31.5. Procurement from Nonappropriated Funds Instrumentalities (NAFIs). NAFIs
   (NCO or Officer Open Messes, etc.) may provide the light refreshments only if the persons
   making the arrangements process the request for goods or services through the base
   contracting officer in accordance with existing procurement directives. (See CG Decision
   B214810, 29 Nov 1984.).
   4.31.6. Refreshments at Recruiting Functions. Appropriated funds may be used for small
   meals and refreshments during recruiting functions for certain individuals (FY 97 NDAA,
   Sec. 361 (P.L. 104-201), as amended by the FY 02 NDAA, Sec. 545 (P.L. 107-107);
   Codified in 10 U.S.C. 520c). For specific details, see AETC 36-2002, Recruiting Procedures
   for the Air Force.

Section 4M—Chapel and Chaplain Programs

4.32. Funding Guidance. Installations that support chapels and chaplain programs will apply
the following funding guidance.
   4.32.1. The primary source of funding for direct mission requirements is appropriated funds.
   In the absence of appropriated funds availability, Chapel Tithes and Offerings Fund (CTOF)
   may be used to fund direct mission requirements. However, the CTOF will not be used to
   fund direct mission facilities (to include repairs, maintenance, alterations, minor
   construction, and military construction); facility infrastructure; readiness requirements;
   communications and information technology; temporary duty expenses; transportation; and
   office supplies. Chaplain Service direct mission requirements fall into the following
   categories: manpower, musicians, choir directors, religious activities coordinators, and
   accounting technicians); facilities (to include repairs, maintenance, alterations, and minor
   construction and military construction); facility infrastructure and multi-media technology (to
   include sound systems); readiness requirements; training; communication and information
   technology; temporary duty expenses; ecclesiastical supplies and equipment; transportation;
   community religious observances; and office supplies.
      4.32.1.1. The FY 2004 NDAA (P.L. 108-136) Section 582 amended 10 U.S.C. by adding
      section 1789, Chaplain-Led Program. It provides authority to use O&M funds to provide
      support services for Chaplain-led programs to assist active duty members of the Armed
      Forces and their immediate family members in building and maintaining a strong family
      structure. The support services are costs of transportation, food, lodging, childcare,
      supplies, fees, and training materials for members and their family members while
      participating in the programs.
      4.32.1.2. Indirect Mission Support requirements are solely funded by CTOF funds.
      Appropriated funds are not available to fund indirect mission requirements. Examples of
      Indirect Mission Support requirements are Youth Programs, Religious Education,
      Women of the Chapel, National Prayer Breakfasts, etc. For additional information contact
      AF/HCB (Mr. Herbert Bryant).
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               69


     4.32.2. Do not use appropriated funds for provision of food or beverage items (unless
     specifically authorized by law), except as determined by the senior chaplain to be a necessary
     integral part of an authorized religious ceremony or otherwise specifically authorized by
     law.
     4.32.3. Chaplain Service resourcing is based on global ministry needs assessment and chapel
     program plans.

Section 4N—Criteria for Determining Expense and Investment Costs

4.33. Distinguishing Between Expense and Investment Costs. Air Force activities at all
levels-- Headquarters, MAJCOMs/FOAs, installations -- must apply uniform cost definition
criteria. These criteria determine whether costs are classified as either an expense or an
investment, and consequently whether it should be budgeted in the expense appropriations of
Operation and Maintenance and Military Personnel or the investment appropriations of
Procurement and Military Construction. DoD 7000.14-R, DoD Financial Management
Regulation, Volume 2A, provides general guidance for DoD use.
4.34. Investment Cost Decision. Figure 4.3 depicts decision-making factors for investment
costs.

EXPENSE


NOTE: For WCF criteria, see Chapter 18.
      4.34.1. The following is a chronology of the expense/investment threshold:
         Fiscal Years                                Increase
FY 2003                               From $100,000 to $250,000 (current)

of the annual Appropriations Act. Prior to FY 1994, the threshold was established in Committee
Reports. (The DWCF threshold is separately codified in 10 U.S.C. 2208.)

Section 4O—Other Guidance

4.35. Personalized Stationery. Authorized: using appropriated funds to print functional titles
of key officials on memorandums and notes. Not Authorized: Using appropriated funds or
government equipment to print the names of officers or other officials on stationery,
memorandums, or notes. (See AF Supplement to DoDD 5330.3. DAPS). AFI 37-161,
Distribution Management, has a list of stationery items from DAPS for various grade levels.
4.36. Business and Greeting Cards:
      4.36.1. Appropriated funds may be used for the printing of business cards, using personal
      computers, existing software and agency-purchased card stock, for use in connection with
      official communications (as distinct from the extension of social or business courtesy).
      (Department of Justice 11 Aug 97 Ruling and OSD (DA&M) 28 Aug 98 Policy
      Memorandum). Additionally, the purchase of business cards from the Lighthouse for the
      Blind, Inc., a Javits-Wagner-O’Day participating non-profit agency, is authorized when the
      organization determines that costs are equivalent or less to purchase cards rather than
      to produce them on a personal computer (OSD (DA&M) 15 Jul 99 Memo) (41 U.S.C. 46-
      48c) (See AF Supplement 2 to DoDD 5330.3). The purchase of business cards from the
      Lighthouse for the Blind must be accomplished through the Defense Automated
      Printing Service (DAPS) per OSD direction.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              71


      4.36.1.1. Commercial Printing of Business Cards. Only those individuals in the
      following five categories are authorized to have business cards commercially printed,
      which includes DAPS, by other than the Lighthouse for the Blind, Inc.:
          4.36.1.1.1. Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS). AFRS/CC approves business
          cards for AFRS personnel involved in recruiting activities. AFRS obtains the cards
          from the Defense Automated Printing Service.
          4.36.1.1.2. Air Force Academy. HQ USAFA/DAR obtains all cards for the Air
          Force Academy Liaison Officers from Defense Printing using USAFA O&M funds.
          4.36.1.1.3. Civilian Employees. The MAJCOM or FOA/DA must approve cards for
          civilian employees engaged in professional recruiting programs. MAJCOM/FOA-
          level officials purchase the cards from Defense Printing.
          4.36.1.1.4. United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR). HQ AFRC/DAP approves
          requests for all USAFR military recruiters, and obtains the cards from Defense
          Printing.
          4.36.1.1.5. Air National Guard (ANG). The Adjutant General (TAG) of the State
          in which the recruiter is located approves orders for cards of National Guard Bureau
          military recruiters. The ANG procures the cards from local vendors.
   4.36.2. Seasonal greeting cards, birthday cards, get well cards, anniversary cards, and
   the like are a personal expense to be borne by the persons who ordered and sent them; do
   not charge their cost to public funds.
4.37. Housing Damage Liability:
   4.37.1. Unaccompanied Personnel Housing (UPH)/Military Family Housing
   (MFH). Personnel residing in UPH or MFH are liable for damage to the quarters/dwelling
   and damage or loss of any equipment or furnishings contained therein provided it is
   determined that the loss or damage was caused by negligence or abuse of the member (or a
   guest of the member).
   4.37.2. Disposing of Refunds. The amounts received as a result of the loss and/or damage
   to Unaccompanied Personnel Housing or Military Family Housing are appropriation refunds.
   Therefore, they are available for immediate reobligation for the same purposes and under the
   same circumstances as other funds in these accounts (see Chapter 5).
4.38. Buying Books, Periodicals, Newspapers and Pamphlets:
   4.38.1. Mission Essential. Air Force libraries procure all mission essential commercial
   books, periodicals, newspapers, and pamphlets for Air Force organizations with appropriated
   funds (APF) centrally managed by HQ AFSVA/SVPAL. AFI 34-270, Air Force Library and
   Information Systems, designates those specific organizations and types of publications which
   are exempt from centrally funded procurement through the library. AFI 34-270 authorizes
   libraries to use local appropriated funds for specific categories of publications and services.
   HQ AFSVA/SVPAL does not centrally fund and procure essential books and subscriptions
   for: Air Force Reserve; Air National Guard; Surgeon General; Judge Advocate General; the
   Air University (including AFIT); United States Air Force Academy; or tenant units or
   agencies funded with non-Air Force appropriations.

4.39. Funding Consecutive Overseas Tours. All Air Force consecutive overseas tours (COT),
in-place and to another overseas base, are funded from the Military Personnel Appropriation
(Appn 3500). AFMAN 65-604 contains the appropriate projects and subprojects to charge the
costs. Refer to this manual to construct the appropriate fund cites for the military member and
their command sponsored family member’s round trip travel to CONUS.
4.40. Appliances and Furnishings for Work Break Areas. Air Force organizations may use
appropriated funds to purchase work break area furnishings and small appliances under the
following conditions.
   4.40.1. Responsible officials must determine that the appliance(s) in question is reasonably
   necessary for, and not just incidental to, the proper execution of an authorized program and
   that employees need to remain at their place of duty (work station) during the work shift.
   4.40.2. Break area furniture is authorized only for officially designated shop break (work)
   areas.
   4.40.3. The purchase of small appliances is for shop break (work) areas that directly support
   the operational mission. (NOTE: In most cases, this will apply only to craft and
   maintenance type-shop areas not accessible to snack bars and cafeterias and not to
   staff/administrative offices, where personnel have desks and offices/cubicles and access
   to the foregoing facilities. Funding for appliances in these offices is the responsibility of
   the individuals working there. The purchase must meet these criteria:
   4.40.4. Acquisition costs are relatively small and no snack bars or other eating facilities are
   readily accessible.
   4.40.5. The appliance acquisition must enhance employee morale and increase employee
   productivity.
   4.40.6. The appliance is not being purchased for the purpose of providing entertainment.
4.41. Retiree Activities Programs. This is a formal program for interface between volunteer
retirees and the active duty community. Details of the program are in AFI 36-3106. Installation
commanders may use appropriated funds to support the Retiree Activities Office (RAO) as
follows.
   4.41.1. Official mail in support of the Retiree Activities.
   4.41.2. Office supplies, printing, equipment, travel, and other operating costs, which have
   been identified and approved in the installation financial plan.
   4.41.3. Official travel expenses authorized per the JTR, volume 1, part K. Reimbursement of
   transportation expenses for travel to and from the retiree volunteer’s residence and the duty
   station (RAO) is not authorized.
4.42. Registration Fees for Meetings and Conferences. Federal military personnel and
civilian employees attend meetings and conferences at government expense when it is part of an
authorized training program or it directly relates to the official duties of the attendee. Meeting
sponsors sometimes charge attendees a fee, usually called a registration fee. The following
provides funding guidance for the payment and management of registration fee.
   4.42.1. Meals. Follow this guidance if you attend a meeting or conference where a
   registration fee includes meal charges and lodging and the charge is an integral part of the
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                           73


  registration fee (that is, inseparable from the fee). You must include in your travel orders
  (and your travel voucher must identify) the number of meals to be provided (for example: ―1
  breakfast, 2 noon, and evening meals and 2 nights of lodging are included in the registration
  fee‖) (See JFTR, Paragraph U2555-E3 and JTR, Paragraph C4955-E3). Generally, the
  government will not reimburse employees for meals consumed at their official duty stations.
  However exceptions to this longstanding Federal Government policy are discussed in
  CompGen Decision B-200650, April 1986. Before any consideration is given to
  reimbursement for a meal at a member’s or civil servant’s permanent duty station (PDS) or
  commuting area, this CompGen must be read in its entirety.
     4.42.1.1. Light Refreshments at Conferences, Symposiums, and Seminars. The
     JFTR and JTR, pursuant to General Services Administration (GSA) travel rulings,
     authorize the serving of light refreshments during breaks at conferences, symposiums,
     and seminars. Light refreshments (excluding alcohol) include such things as coffee, tea,
     milk, juice, soft drinks, doughnuts, bagels, fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, muffins, or
     similar items. Comptroller General (CompGen) Decision B-288266 dated January
     27, 2003 directs that appropriated funds may only be spent to procure the amount
     of snacks and refreshments required to serve those employees in a travel status.
     Those employees who are not in a TDY status at the location where the conference is
     being held are not authorized refreshments at Government expense. The serving of light
     refreshments during an ”ice breaker” before the conference or after the conference
     (farewell socials) are a personal expense. For Air Force sponsored conferences
     (paragraph 4.42.2.2), the organization that sponsors the conference will fund any
     light refreshments served during breaks in conference sessions and, therefore, it is
     the sponsoring organization’s option as to whether they wish to have such
     refreshments. It is not an entitlement. NOTE: Simply referring to a local meeting on
     an installation, at a MAJCOM, or at HQ USAF, with one or two people TDY in
     attendance, as a conference, seminar or symposium does not confer authority to use
     appropriated funds for light refreshments for those individuals in a travel status.
         4.42.1.1.1. Serving Materials for Conferences. Protocol offices at MAJCOMs,
         NAFs, FOAs, DRUs, ALCs, Product Centers, and Air University having conference
         facilities with the capacity, décor, and equipment to host conferences such as Corona,
         General Officer Orientation, Retired General Officer’s Summit, significant foreign
         defense delegations, Air Force-wide functional conferences or other large and
         significant conferences may procure the minimum serving materials necessary to
         serve snacks and refreshments. A coffee maker for the conference facility is
         authorized for purchase with APF. Its sole use is for conferences and not day-to-day
         use in any individual office. Coffee makers, microwave ovens, and the like for
         individual offices are a personal expense, not a government expense. The serving
         materials authorized are intended for serving snacks and beverages and are not
         intended to equip protocol offices for serving full course meals. Fine china, genuine
         silverware or silver-plated utensils, linens and linen laundry service are not
         authorized. While the serving materials may be borrowed for use in the most senior
         command offices to serve VIP visitors, but not stored or retained there, this does not
         convey any authority to procure snacks and beverages with APF for those visiting
         VIPs. That is a personal expense, unless otherwise authorized for APF funding with
74                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


        Official Representation Funds (ORF) (AFI 65-603 implementing 10 U.S.C. 127). The
        authority to procure these serving materials does not extend to base level
        protocol offices that may only procure disposable serving materials or borrow
        materials from the clubs as may be required for a conference.
  4.42.2. Budgeting and Funding for Air Force Sponsored Meetings or Conferences. This
  guidance applies to all levels of command.
     4.42.2.1. Follow guidance prescribed in appropriate training instructions (for example,
     AFPD 36-4 and AFPD 36-22 and their implementing instructions) for meetings or
     conferences that qualify as formal training.
     4.42.2.2. Within the Air Force, organizations that sponsor a conference that does not
     come under the authority of formal training guidance will pay for speaker fees,
     honorariums, off base facility costs (excluding lodging), light refreshments and snacks
     between sessions, and other related costs, which shall not include gifts or mementos for
     guest speakers, from their O&M type funds, rather than recover such costs through a
     registration fee. For example, if HQ USAF, a MAJCOM, or base level organization
     directs or invites attendance at a conference, the organization sponsoring the meeting or
     conference must fund these costs from their own O&M-type funds. If HQ USAF or a
     MAJCOM directs a subordinate installation to host a meeting or a conference, the HQ
     USAF or MAJCOM organization is the sponsor and responsible for the costs of the
     meeting or conference. The subordinate installation is merely the host, not the sponsor. In
     general, use the AF Form 9, Request for Purchase, to contract for off-base conference
     facilities, if appropriate.
     4.42.2.3. If a conference, workshop, training, etc. comes under the authority of formal
     training guidance (see Education & Training Course Training Announcements at
     https://etca.randolph.af.mil) and a registration fee is charged, the approving official is
     responsible for ensuring that no unauthorized charges are included in the fee. To
     accomplish this, prepare a budget that itemizes each of the costs to be included in the fee
     (such as meals, guest speakers, meeting rooms, set-up charges, and other similar charges.
     4.42.2.4. Sponsoring activities may levy a ―hospitality‖ fee to cover purely social
     functions, i.e., ―ice breakers,‖ occurring before the opening of the conference or farewell
     gatherings after the close of the conference. However, payment of such a hospitality
     fee is voluntary and is not reimbursable from appropriated funds. Do not authorize
     such a fee in travel orders (See JFTR, Paragraph U2555-E3 and JTR, Paragraph
     C4955-E3).
     4.42.2.5. Sponsoring activities may charge non-Air Force government attendees a fee
     which covers food or beverage costs as a minimum. Sponsors may charge an additional
     fee for a pro rata share of other costs if the circumstances dictate. Charge nongovernment
     attendees for food and beverage costs as well as appropriate charge for any services
     provided per DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapters 1 and 4. Deposit all fees
     collected from non-government attendees under the foregoing guidelines into the
     Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.
  4.42.3. Government (NonAir Force) Sponsored Meetings and/or Conferences. Charge
  the cost of registration fees and other official expenses for government (nonAir Force)
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             75


   meetings/conferences to the attendee’s organizational O&M type funds, per applicable
   directives (for example, the Joint Federal Travel Regulation). Registration fees paid by the
   Air Force attendee’s organization can include the cost of light refreshments and snacks
   served during breaks in conference sessions. If the attendee is in an official travel status,
   include the amount of a registration fee in the travel orders, and indicate all meals
   (JFTR, Paragraph U2555-E3 and JTR, Paragraph C4955-E3) and lodging covered by
   the fee on the individual’s travel voucher.
   4.42.4. NonGovernment Sponsored Meetings and/or Conferences. Charge the cost of
   registration fees and other official expenses for nongovernment meetings/conferences to the
   attendee’s organization O&M type funds, as in 4.42.3 above. If the attendee is in an official
   travel status, include the registration fee in the travel orders and identify all meals
   covered by the fee on the individual'’ travel voucher.
   4.42.5. Funding Scientific, Technical, and Professional Symposiums, Conferences, and
   Similar Meetings. Conferences, symposiums, and similar meetings in the scientific,
   technical, and professional fields may employ a contractor, through normal acquisition
   procedures, for the purpose of handling the administrative arrangements. Generally, these
   types of gatherings involve the Air Force Research Laboratory. DoD, non-DoD Federal, and
   non-government personnel may be charged a registration fee by the contractor to cover all
   the costs associated with the contract, including a reasonable profit. The contractor collects
   all registration fees. This registration fee is a reimbursable expense on the travel voucher.
   However, any meals included in the fee will be deducted from the authorized per diem.
   4.42.6. Co-Sponsorship. Chapter 3 of DoD 5500.7-R, the Joint Ethics Regulation,
   authorizes a DoD component to co-sponsor scientific, technical, and professional
   conferences, seminars, or like events with a non-Federal entity when specific conditions in
   the regulation are met. Those conditions are restated in AFI 61-205. As a co-sponsor of one
   of these events, the Air Force organization, acting as a co-sponsor, may follow the same
   procedures as when the Air Force is the sole sponsor. Follow the same procedures as in
   paragraph 4.42.5. Alternatively, the Air force organization may choose to have the non-
   Federal entity, which is the co-sponsor of the event, handle the administrative arrangements.
   In that case, the DoD, non-DoD Federal, and non-government personnel would pay the
   registration fee to the non-Federal entity co-sponsor to cover all administrative costs.
4.43. Veterinary Services:
   4.43.1. The U.S. Army Veterinary Service is considered an integral part of the local Air
   Force medical staff and, as such, is not considered a tenant on the Air Force base. The unique
   relationship entitles the Army Veterinary Service to receive common services, logistics
   support services, supply support, and maintenance support without reimbursement to the Air
   Force commander. Any reimbursement for services provided will be funded with Defense
   Health Program (DHP) funds of the Air Force Medical Group on the installation.
   4.43.2. Collect surcharge fees for veterinary services into the General Receipt Account
   573210.9999 (Receipts not otherwise classified) no less often than weekly, or daily when
   total collections reach $1,000 or greater. (See DFAS-DE 7010.2-R for detailed procedures.)
4.44. Membership in Professional Organizations. Air Force organizations may use O&M
funds to pay membership fees in professional organizations only in the name of the Air Force
 76                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


organization and only if the membership will benefit the organization’s mission. Air Force
activities may not use O&M funds to pay for membership fees which are in the name of an
individual. (See 53 CG 429, 52 CG 495, 24 CG 814, 3 CG 963, 5 U.S.C. 4109, and 5 U.S.C.
5946.)
   4.44.1. Membership in Civic Organizations. CompGen Decision B-205356 (61 Comp.
   Gen. 542, July 23, 1982) allows for the use of appropriated funds for an agency/installation
   membership, not an individual membership, in civic organizations which allow
   membership in the name of an organization, provided there is ―an administrative
   determination that the payment of fees is necessary for the agency to carry out its authorized
   activities‖ and ―the proposed membership must primarily benefit the agency involved, not its
   individual employees.‖ CompGen Decision B-205356 should be read in its entirety before
   deciding to expend APF for such a membership. The Comptroller General has cautioned that
   their decision ―does not mean that every military installation or regional Government office
   can use appropriated funds to join the Rotary, Kiwanis, Lions and similar organizations.‖
4.45. Special Drinking Water. Air Force organizations may purchase drinking water (bottled
water) with appropriated funds only when it is a necessary expense from the government’s
standpoint:
   4.45.1. The public water supply is unsafe for human consumption as determined by
   competent medical/environmental authority in writing.
   4.45.2. There is an emergency failure of the water source on the installation.
   4.45.3. A temporary facility has no drinking water available within a reasonable distance.
   4.45.4. There is no water fit for drinking purposes, as determined by competent
   medical/environmental authority in writing, available without cost or at a lower cost to the
   government. The purchase of drinking water (bottled water) with APF ceases to be
   authorized when the problem with the drinking water has been remedied. (See
   CompGen B-247871, B-147622, 3 CG 828, 5 CG 90, 17 CG 698, 18 CG 238, 24 CG 56, and
   25 CG 920.)
   4.45.5. Bottled or Potable Water Purchases Incident to Temporary Duty
   (TDY). Military members and civilian travelers, directed to perform TDY, are not
   authorized bottled/potable water as a reimbursable expense. Bottled water is part of the
   subsistence portion of the per diem allowance. Reference: JFTR (military), Chapter 4, Part F,
   Miscellaneous Reimbursable Expenses and JTR (civilian), Chapter 4, Part O, Reimbursable
   Travel Expenses
   4.45.6. Sports Beverages. Any requirement to provide sports beverages such as Gatorade
   must be established by competent medical authority. If the local medical treatment facility
   (MTF) commander or a medically qualified representative makes a medical determination, in
   writing, that consumption of such beverages during the performance of official duties is
   necessary to maintain the physical well being of Air Force members, the use of
   organizational O&M funds to procure the beverages is authorized. The authority to make this
   medical determination cannot be delegated to other installation organization commanders.
   This is the only circumstance under which APF is authorized to procure such beverages for
   consumption during the performance of official duties. This direction is not intended to
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            77


   and does not preclude competent medical authority from prescribing the use of sports
   beverages for medical reasons for individual members on or off duty.
4.46. CREEK SWEEP Credits. CREEK SWEEP credits are entitlements to the United States
Air Force from the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) in the form of goods and services (not
money). The FRG provides the credits under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) executed
by HQ USAFE on behalf of the Department of Defense (DoD) and FRG. Air Force installations
may accomplish facility requirements (maintenance, repair, renovation, and construction)
normally funded with appropriated funds, except as noted herein, with CREEK SWEEP credits
provided that the using installation applies all policies, rules, and procedures which apply to
appropriated funded projects to the CREEK SWEEP credit projects. Any deviation from this
guidance must have the prior approval of SAF/IEI. (Section 9008, Public Law 101165,
November 21, 1989, provides standing authority).
   4.46.1. Don’t use for minor construction projects costing over $750,000 accomplished with
   CREEK SWEEP credits to renovate or improve office space; further,
   4.46.2. Don’t use them for any purpose on Senior or General Officer housing.
   4.46.3. Don’t use CREEK SWEEP credits to accomplish facility requirements normally
   funded with nonappropriated funds (NAF) unless specifically approved by SAF/IEI.
4.47. Licenses and Certificates for Military Members. CompGen Decision B-252467, June
3, 1994, allows the Air Force to pay for licenses and certificates for military personnel in
instances where Federal law compels Air Force members to comply with state and local
regulations requiring the licenses or certificates. The CompGen Decision is not applicable to
civilian employees of the Air Force, only to Air Force members. However, as stated in the
Decision ―….appropriated funds are not available to meet the licensing requirements of
professional personnel such as teachers, accountants, engineers, lawyers, doctors, and nurses.‖
Appropriated funds will not be used for professional licenses of military or civilian personnel.
   4.47.1. Expenses for Professional Credentials. The FY 2002 National Defense
   Authorization Act (P.L. 107-107, Dec. 28, 2001) Section 1112, which amends Chapter 57 of
   Title 5, U.S.C., provides that an agency may use appropriated funds to pay for: 1) expenses
   for employees to obtain professional credentials, including expenses for professional
   accreditation, State-imposed and professional licenses and professional certification; and 2)
   examinations to obtain such credentials. This authority may not be exercised on behalf of any
   employee occupying or seeking to qualify for appointment to any position that is excepted
   from the competitive service because of the confidential, policy-determining, policy-making,
   or policy advocating character of the position. This authority is permissive, not
   mandatory. It does NOT establish an entitlement. Because of the financial impact this
   authority may have on the DoD, OSD has decided that they will issue implementation
   guidance for the Services’ exercise of this authority.
       4.47.1.1. HQ USAF/DP 28 March 2003 ALL MAJCOM-FOA-DRU/CV Memorandum
       provided Air Force policy on payment of expenses to obtain professional credentials.
       Because the authority is codified in Title 5 U.S.C., Government Organization and
       Employees, this authority is applicable to civilian employees only and not to military
       members.

4.48. Service Contracts Crossing Fiscal Years. The FY 98 National Defense Authorization
Act (NDAA) (P.L. 105-85) (Codified in 10 U.S.C. 2410A) allows ―for procurement of severable
services for a period that begins in one fiscal year and ends in the next fiscal year if (without
regard to any option to extend the period of the contract) the contract period does not exceed one
year.‖ The total cost of the services to be provided over the 12- month period must be reflected
in the contract and that amount must be obligated when the contract is signed. The FY 2004
NDAA (P.L. 108-136), Section 1005 further amended 10 U.S.C. 2410A. In addition to
authorizing severable service contracts for a 12-month period crossing fiscal years, it now
authorizes 12-month contracts crossing fiscal years for leasing of ―real or personal property,
including maintenance of such property when contracted for as part of the lease agreement.‖
4.49. Air Navigation and Overflight Fees. It is U.S. Government (USG) policy not to pay for
routine air navigation and overflight fees that may be assessed by foreign governments on U.S.
military aircraft that fly over their air space. For Foreign Landing and Parking Fee policy see
paragraph 4.50.
   4.49.1. Air navigation and overflight fees are chargeable only in cases where the USG has
   negotiated a treaty or other agreement with a foreign government or federation that
   authorizes the payment of these fees. An example would be Arms Control treaties that
   discuss the movement of On-Site Inspection Agency (OSIA) teams via AMC organic airlift
   into the former Soviet Union states.
   4.49.2. There may be instances where a particular foreign government will demand the
   payment of air navigation and overflight fees in return for allowing U.S. military aircraft to
   depart the foreign base/ airport, essentially holding the aircraft hostage until payment is
   received even though the USG policy has deemed it an unauthorized expenditure. In these
   cases, the aircraft commander is authorized to pay these fees and should follow payment
   procedures established in the ―DoD Foreign Clearance Guide,‖ located in the forward part of
   each regional booklet, Section I, paragraph A5 or A6, as appropriate.
4.50. Landing and Parking Fees Assessed by Foreign Governments. Air Force aircraft
squadrons/ flying units may pay landing and parking fees upon request at foreign commercial
airports in accordance with USG policy. Landing and parking fees should not be paid by USG
aircraft at foreign government-controlled airports or air bases.
4.51. Funding for Athletic Supplies and Fitness Equipment. Per AFI 34-204 (currently in
coordination for release as AFI 34-404, Property Management), Paragraph 3.3. (will be
paragraph 2.4.5. in new AFI), unit level physical fitness equipment is authorized under certain
conditions. The appropriate Services/Group Commander must approve the use of organizational
funds to procure fitness equipment (FSC 7830). Written justification must be provided to the
Commander when an organization requests such approval. For ordering and inventory
guidance, review AFI 34-204, Paragraph 3.3 (see AFI/paragraph Change above).
Organizations may now use the GPC card to procure organizational intramural sports uniforms.
The uniforms may not be personalized with individual names or nicknames and are to be
returned to the unit following the season or when the member PCSs. Units whose operations
are funded solely with working capital funds are prohibited from using such funds to procure
MWR equipment such as intramural uniforms and fitness equipment. These units should
continue to use Services sports uniform loan program and utilize equipment provided at the base
fitness center. Examples of such units are those at AMC aerial ports i.e., Dover, McGuire,
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                 79


Travis, McChord, and Charleston AFBs, which are funded with Transportation Working Capital
Funds (TWCF). (NOTE: Funding of PT Uniforms for physical fitness (CSAF Site Picture
July 2003, “Fit to Fight”) are being worked at the Air Staff. Local funds are not authorized
for purchasse of PT Uniforms.
4.52. Real Property Damage Recovery. The FY 96 Authorization Act (P.L. 104-106) Section
2821 (Codified in 10 U.S.C. 2782) authorizes amounts recovered for damage to real property
(excluding MFH) to be credited to the accounts for which costs of repair or replacement may be
paid at the time the recovery is received. However, the law provides that amounts recovered
from such damage are not available for obligation and expenditure unless provided in advance in
an Appropriations Act. Do not use funds collected for real property damages to finance any
repairs unless provided for in an Appropriations Act. Real property includes land improvements
(e.g., road and curbing), buildings and permanently attached equipment (e.g., truck scale),
structures (small buildings and entrance facilities), and appurtenances (signs and fences).
4.53. Undefinitized Contractual Actions (UCAs). These are also referred to as ―unpriced
orders‖ and ―letter contracts.‖ When an annual appropriation or a multi-year appropriation in
the last year of availability is used to execute one of these types of contractual actions and
definitization occurs in the following fiscal year, the amount being definitized becomes a bona
fide need of the (annual appropriation) or a (multi-year appropriation) fiscal year current at the
time of definitization (CompGen Decision B-197274, Sept. 23, 1983). Under the Federal
Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, no more than 50% of the overall ceiling price on these
types of contracts may be obligated. Any amount of that 50% of the ceiling price, which is not
obligated in the fiscal year the letter contract is signed, becomes part of the definitization amount
in the current fiscal year.
4.54. U. S. Flag for Active Duty Military Retirees. The FY 99 Authorization Act (P.L. 105-
261), Section 644 © (Codified in 10 U.S.C. 8681) directs that ―upon release of a member of the
Air Force from active duty for retirement, the Secretary of the Air Force shall present a United
States flag to the member.‖ As stated in the statute, ―The presentation of a flag under this section
shall be at no cost to the recipient.‖ The flag will, in fact, be presented by the organization from
which the individual is retiring and not the SECAF. The flag will be funded from the
installation’s O&M-type account. Obtaining flags flown over the U.S. Capital for presentation at
retirement are eligible for funding from O&M. The use of appropriated funds to procure a
display box for a retirement flag is not authorized by this statute. The statute prohibits multiple
presentations of flags (see 10 U.S.C. 8681). (NOTE: Civilian employees of the Military
Departments are not authorized to receive Government-funded U.S. Flags or any other
type of flag at retirement. The only exception is that members of the Senior Executive
Service (SES) may, upon retirement or separation, be awarded their SES Flag.).
   4.54.1. U.S. Flag for Reserve Component Retirees. The FY 2000 Authorization Act (P.L.
   106-65), Section 652 (Codified in 10 U.S.C. 12605) directs that ―(A) Upon the transfer from
   an active status or discharge of a reserve who has completed the years of service required for
   eligibility for retired pay under Chapter 1223 of this title [10 U.S.C.], the Secretary
   concerned shall present a United States flag to the member.‖ The same information in
   paragraph 4.54 above applies, except Reserve (3740) or ANG (3840) O&M funds will be
   used for procuring the U.S. Flag and 10 U.S.C. 12605 should be reviewed for prohibition on
   multiple presentations.
 80                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   4.54.2. Joint Organizations. Air Force O&M funds will be used to procure flags for
   retiring military members, without regard to Service affiliation, in Joint Organizations for
   which the Air Force is Executive Agent, i.e. CENTCOM.
   4.54.3. Printing of Invitations and Programs for Military and Civilian Retirements and
   Promotions. In recognition of technology advances, OSD(DA&M) 28 Aug 98 Policy
   Memorandum authorized the printing of business cards using personal computers, existing
   software, and agency-purchased card stock for official communications. For the same reason,
   that authority is extended to the printing of invitations and programs for retirement
   ceremonies. APFs are not authorized for the commercial printing, including DAPS, of
   invitations and programs for military and civilian retirements.
4.55. Memorials and Monuments. Absent specific statutory authority, appropriated funds are
not available to fund the construction of memorials or monuments. The construction of
memorials in Washington, DC are funded through private donations, e.g. the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial, the World War II Memorial, the Air Force Memorial, the Navy Memorial, etc. The
Federal Government donates the land and private funds construct the memorial. Once
constructed, federal funds are used to maintain the memorials. See AFI 36-3108,
Memorialization Program and Ceremonies.
4.56. Cable TV in Dormitories. Appropriated funds are not authorized for procuring television
sets for or funding Cable TV subscription charges in individual rooms or suites in dormitories.
They are a personal expense. (EXCEPTION: Beginning in FY 03, OSD has authorized
appropriated funds (PBD 205, 10 Dec 01) to provide all on-base USAFE personnel access to the
cable television services of AFRTS for command & control and force protection purposes). APF
may be used to fund cable TV for day or community rooms utilized by all dorm occupants, as
well as, various gaming items found in the recreation area of a home such as a billiard table,
foosball table, VCR, video games, DVD player, etc. It is essential that internal controls are
present to avoid loss of these items through theft.
4.57. Heart Link Program. CSAF May 30, 2002 memorandum, SUBJECT: Implementation of
Heart Link Program, established this program based on a determination of the Air Force
Community Action Information Board (CAIB) ―that a standardized Spouse Orientation Program
is critical to family preparedness and enhances mission readiness.‖ Among other things, as a part
of this program, each spouse will be presented with a standardized coin after completing the
Heart Link Program. The front of the coin will have the Heart Link logo and the back will have
the MAJCOM crest. The logo may be modified to reflect the MAJCOM mission.
4.58. Temporary Authority to Hire Contract Firefighters or Security Guards. The FY
2003 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) (P.L. 107-314) Section 332 provides
authority for hiring of civilian contract security guards ―for any increased performance of
security-guard functions at a military installation or facility under the jurisdiction of the
Secretary of a military department undertaken in response to the terrorist attacks on the United
States on September 11, 2001, and may waive the prohibition under section 2465(a) of title 10,
United States Code, with respect to such contract….‖ under the conditions outlined in the NDAA
section. This authority for contractor performance of security-guard functions under this section
shall terminate at the end of the three-year period beginning on the date (2 December 2002) of
the enactment of the FY 2003 NDAA. The conditions pertaining to this authority are too lengthy
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             81

Section 4P—Planning and Tracking Obligations and Outlays

4.59. Supplementing OSD Appropriations (97X) with O&M 3400 Funds. Per OSD(C)
guidance, do not commingle OSD (97X) appropriations and O&M 3400 funds on a contract
when initiating the contract or to cover any cost increase on contracts funded with one or the
other appropriation. However, you may use O&M 3400 funds to support an OSD-funded
program for civilian pay, supplies, and other miscellaneous purchases that do not involve the
commingling of the two appropriations on one contract, as long as those OSD-funded program
efforts are the same as those for which O&M 3400 are or could be authorized, i.e. RAP and TAP
programs. This does not preclude the citing of the two appropriations on a service contract when
the use of the service is subject to a documented prorata cost sharing arrangement based on usage
of that service by organizations funded from the two appropriations.
4.60. Submitting Outlay Plans. OMB Circular No. A-112, Monitoring Federal Outlays,
requires the Air Force to prepare a forecast plan for outlays. In September each year, the Office
of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Comptroller (Program/Budget) requires the services to
develop a monthly outlay forecast plan for the upcoming fiscal year. HQ AFMC provides a
monthly plan for major weapon systems for the investment and RDT&E appropriations per
annual guidance from SAF/FMB. The monthly plan for all other appropriations is prepared by
SAF/FMB. SAF/FMB consolidates and submits the outlay plan for all Air Force appropriations
to the DoD Comptroller. SAF/FMB analyzes variances at the weapon system/ program element
level and provides deviation reports to the DoD comptroller when requested.
4.61. Planning:
   4.61.1. In November, SAF/FMB tasks AFMC/FMB to develop the outlay plan for major
   weapon systems. The AFMC/FMB suspense date to SAF/FMB is the end of December.
   4.61.2. AFMC submits the finalized procurement plans via diskette to SAF/FMBMM for
   consolidation and review. SAF/FMBMM loads the plans into the automated Air Force
   Obligation/Outlay Tracking System.
   4.61.3. SAF/FMBOI separately tasks all MAJCOMs/FOAs for O&M plans to be submitted
   directly to SAF/FMBOI. SAF/FMBOI consolidates and submits the finalized plans to
   SAF/FMBMM for input to the Air Force Obligation/Outlay Tracking System.
   4.61.4. SAF/FMB reviews and adjusts the appropriation and program year monthly
   distributions and submits the official Air Force Outlay Plan to OSD in an automated format
   for inclusion in the DoD system.
4.62. Tracking. DoD compares execution data against the plans as follows:
   4.62.1. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Centers submit summary
   flash execution data to OSD. DFAS provides outlay data on the eighth workday following
   the end of the month. Once OSD produces outlay tracking reports, the Air Force provides
   variance analyses by weapon system within 24 hours. Currently, Air Force Materiel
   Command provides detailed variance analyses on the 10th workday to meet the OSD
   suspense.
82                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


  4.62.2. DFAS-DE submits execution data for outlays under RCS: SAF-FMB(M)7131,
  Update Obligation/Outlay Tracking System, in order to update the Outlay Tracking System
  on the 10th workday of each month. The Air Force uses this information to identify shortages
  or overages by weapons system or program element within the appropriations. The RCS:
  SAF-FMB(M)7131 report has been designated emergency status code C3. Continue
  reporting during emergency conditions, delayed precedence. Submit data requirements as
  prescribed, but they may be delayed to allow the submission of higher precedence reports.
  Submit by nonelectronic means, if possible. Discontinue electronic reporting during
  MINIMIZE.
  4.62.3. SAF/FMBMM prepares a monthly status report by appropriation that gives the year-
  to-date plan data, the year-to-date execution data, variances from plan, and percent
  accomplishment of actual to plan, along with a written rationale, by weapons system, for
  significant variances over or under plan by appropriation.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                83

                APPROPRIATION REIMBURSEMENTS AND REFUNDS

Section 5A—Appropriation Reimbursements

5.1. General Reimbursement Guidance:
   5.1.1. The appropriation reimbursement concept avoids duplicating services, facilities,
   personnel, and stocks of supplies and materiel, and requires the agency requesting these
   services or supplies to budget for the cost and to defend its requirements to the President and
   the Congress.
   5.1.2. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) includes anticipated appropriation
   reimbursements as part of approved apportionments. SAF/FMB transmits this funding
   authority to the commands (except for procurement appropriations, see paragraph 5.4.2.1),
   in addition to, and separate from, funds appropriated exclusively for Air Force mission
   requirements.
   5.1.3. MAJCOMs won’t allot anticipated reimbursements unless they have reasonable
   assurance that the reimbursements will be collected. Even when reimbursements are
   apportioned and allotted, these estimates don’t become budgetary resources available for
   obligation unless you have valid orders (including written agreements), have furnished goods
   or services and there is entitlement, or in the case of orders from the public (that is, financed
   by other than federal government sources), the requester has made advance payment.
   EXCEPTION: in the case of the stock fund under the Defense Working Capital Fund
   (DWCF), 10 U.S.C. 2210(b) authorizes, with OMB approval, incurring obligations against
   anticipated reimbursements.
   5.1.4. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) orders convey obligation authority, but don’t disburse
   until cash is transferred from the FMS Trust Fund to the performing appropriation account or
   the holder of the FMS Trust provides an expenditure authorization. Therefore, except as
   provided above, funding based on anticipated reimbursements is available only to the extent
   you actually realize reimbursements. Don’t anticipate conversion from your approved
   reimbursement programs to direct obligation authority.
   5.1.5. Financial Management and Comptroller offices will credit reimbursements to
   appropriations based on the type of work done. Finance reimbursements from appropriations
   that fund similar direct program requirements. For example, Research Development Testing
   and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriation finances reimbursable RDT&E efforts.
   5.1.6. DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 11A lists the types of costs that are reimbursable and the
   amounts to recoup when DoD components do work or sell property within the Department of
   Defense, to other U.S. Government agencies, and to private parties when allowed by legal
   authority.
5.2. Responsibilities for Developing Anticipated Reimbursements:
   5.2.1. The Air Force supplying or performing activity must include estimated anticipated
   reimbursements to be realized from sale of supplies and services in their budget estimates
   and financial plans. Based on this, SAF/FMB will develop Air Force-wide budget estimates
 84                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   and apportionment requests. SAF/FMB estimates reimbursements for centrally administered
   programs and for centrally procured materiel based on departmental agreements and financial
   data available. SAF/FMB asks supplying or performing activities for supporting data and
   backup exhibits as required (such as computation sheets or additional listings). SAF/FMB
   will budget for military construction reimbursements based on the historical level of effort or
   substantiated documentation changing that level from the Program Manager’s management.
   5.2.2. Operating agencies must inform SAF/FMB of changes in estimates of anticipated
   reimbursements and identify the changes by category and sales code. Request you provide
   these changes as soon as they are known so adjustments may be made during the Air Force
   budget submission to reduce disconnects in the year of execution.
5.3. Responsibilities for Earning Anticipated Reimbursable Programs. Budget officers and
appropriate functional area staff agency heads, such as Civil Engineer and Transportation, must
act jointly to review reimbursement programs to make sure these programs are proceeding as
planned. Consider all programs where reimbursements are anticipated, including programmed
support for materiel and services identified in support agreements for intraservice, interservice,
and non-DoD activities.
   5.3.1. Responsibility for Establishing Reimbursement Receivables for Earned
   Reimbursements. MAJCOM and installation Financial Management and Comptroller
   offices must provide their operating location Defense Accounting office (Field Organization)
   with appropriate billing information to establish reimbursement receivables. This is
   necessary to ensure accurate and timely billing of earned reimbursements. All reimbursement
   receivable balances must be validated during quarterly and year-end certifications.
5.4. Funding Procedures and Application. In developing the financial plan, SAF/FMB will
include anticipated reimbursements based on estimated customer orders to be received in the
total amount planned to be available for obligation. Appropriation managers distribute planned
obligations between those for ―service account‖ (Air Force) and those for ―customer account‖
(reimbursable). This plan will be the basis for the initial apportionment request and for funding
to commands.
   5.4.1. Annual Appropriations. MAJCOM and installation Financial Management and
   Comptroller offices and Financial Services Officers (FSO) will initially account for
   reimbursable orders under the appropriation available for obligation when they accept the
   order. But, if you haven’t filled the order and haven’t set up the related reimbursable
   obligation before the appropriation expires, the FSO must move the unfilled order to the next
   fiscal year’s appropriation on or before 30 September (see DFAS-DE 7220.1-R). See
   paragraph 5.8.2 for statutory restrictions on Economy Act Orders (31 U.S.C. 1535).
       5.4.1.1. All Annual Appropriations Except Operation and Maintenance, Air Force,
       (O&M) and Military Personnel, Air Force. Appropriation managers issue budget
       authorizations, including financing for customers’ orders for goods or services, at
       program level and specify the amounts for ―service account‖ and for ―customers’ orders‖.
       Use sales codes to identify reimbursable customers.
       5.4.1.2. Automatic Apportionment for O&M Reimbursements: The Office of
       Management and Budget (OMB) authorizes using automatic apportionment of
       reimbursements for the Operation and Maintenance (O&M), AF appropriation (57*3400,
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               85


     Fund Code 30) and AFRC O&M appropriation (57*3740, Fund Code 54). SAF/FMBO
     may automatically increase the OMB apportionment up to the planned amount of
     anticipated reimbursements expected to be received during the current year of execution
     at the departmental level. In addition, during the year of execution, SAF/FMBO
     automatically apportions and issues all reimbursement authority to MAJCOM/FOAs FM
     offices. The field level budget offices load reimbursements as they are earned. (No target
     is given to the MAJCOM or base budget office.)
     5.4.1.3. Family Housing appropriation 57*7045 (Fund Code 83, O&M). Deposit
     proceeds from renting family housing and reimbursements received for family housing
     services to the family housing account. Apply proceeds from sales of designated excess
     military family housing to the Military Family housing Operations and Maintenance
     (O&M) Account 57X07045 (Refer to Chapter 21 for additional information).
  5.4.2. Multiple Year Appropriations. For multiple-year appropriations whose periods of
  availability for obligation overlap, apply new reimbursable orders and related transactions
  only to the most current account available during the period the orders were accepted. In
  other words, don’t accept new orders in a multiple-year appropriation account after its first
  year of availability. Performing activities that are accounting for customer orders funded by
  multiple year appropriations shall retain the unearned and unobligated balances of valid
  unfilled reimbursable orders with the unexpired appropriation current at the time the
  customer order was accepted. However, FM offices and FSOs must take action at fiscal
  yearend for expiring accounts to move unfilled orders for which reimbursable obligations
  haven’t been established to the ensuing current fiscal year appropriation account (see DFAS-
  DE 7220.1-R Paragraph C2.5) and eliminate anticipated reimbursements (authorized
  reimbursable budget program), which are nullified at fiscal yearend, to the extent they
  haven’t been realized.
     5.4.2.1. Procurement Appropriations:
         5.4.2.1.1. Budget authorizations include financing for procurement of customer
         orders or security assistance sales, grant aid, etc., and are available only to the extent
         you receive valid customer orders. This procedure assumes firm customer orders and
         customer reimbursement at time of delivery. For customer orders from the public,
         state, and local governments, DoD requires payment in advance before using Air
         Force funds provided for financing customer orders.
         5.4.2.1.2. MAJCOMs must provide SAF/FMB, before the fiscal year begins, the total
         annual amount of estimated anticipated reimbursements (other than FMS) by
         appropriation and sales code. MAJCOMs must report anticipated reimbursements in
         the Status of Funds Data Base Transmission, RCS: SAF-FM(M)7801-DE report.
         MAJCOMs must also report the status of the total customer program to the degree
         that orders are received and deliveries are reported. Anticipated reimbursements
         reported by MAJCOM:
             5.4.2.1.2.1. For the current appropriation year are identified by accounts
             receivable sales code, and must equal the sum of filled and reported orders to
             agree with the Air Force program at departmental level. SAF/FMB or MAJCOMs
             may make changes to the anticipated program during the operating year.
 86                                                    AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


                   5.4.2.1.2.2. For each unexpired prior-year appropriation must show the most
                   recent 30 September certified status, as adjusted by the operating agency for
                   actual customer order adjustments during the current year. When there have been
                   significant customer order adjustments to prior-year programs, MAJCOMs will
                   advise SAF/FMB of the reason for such adjustment.
                   5.4.2.1.2.3. Table 5.1 explains how to charge and credit the procurement
                   appropriations for the purchase or sale of investment items to fill customer orders
                   .

       5.4.2.2. Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) Appropriation:
          5.4.2.2.1. SAF/FMB, Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), and Air Force Space
          Command (AFSPC) are responsible for reporting anticipated reimbursements to
          DFAS-DE on the monthly status of reimbursements for the RDT&E appropriation.
          Anticipated reimbursements reported for the current year must equal the budget
          authorization provided and identified by sales code as shown in the Air Force
          Corporate Data Dictionary. Anticipated reimbursements reported for each unexpired
          prior year appropriation are equal to the sum of actual filled and unfilled orders.
          Adjust unfilled orders reported to show the actual customer order adjustments during
          the fiscal year. SAF/FMB adjusts the budget authorization for RDT&E reimbursable
          accounts annually by providing adjustments to equal the sum of the unfilled and
          earned amounts in the respective Status of Funds Data Base Transmission, RCS:
          SAF-FM(M)7801-DE report.
          5.4.2.2.2. AFMC and AFSPC uses RDT&E to finance its installations that perform
          development and test functions. These activities do work such as testing and
          engineering support at the request of other Air Force commands or other government
88                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


        agencies on a reimbursable basis. The requesting organization will reimburse the
        RDT&E operating funds of the performing AFMC installation for direct costs of
        supplies, civilian overtime, related TDY, etc. (see Chapter 7, Section 7I). At least
        quarterly, AFMC will review and recommend appropriate adjustments to the
        estimated reimbursable amounts based on written agreements with other
        organizations for test and engineering support.
        5.4.2.2.3. FM and FSO offices account for amendments to prior-year orders in the
        appropriation year in which the customer amendment is accepted (and obligated) by
        the performing agency.
     5.4.2.3. Construction Appropriations. Appropriation managers issue budget
     authorizations at the Budget Authorization Account Number (BAAN) level for P-354.
     This document indicates the amount for ―service account‖ and for ―customers’ orders.‖
  5.4.3. Centralized Reimbursements:
     5.4.3.1. Redistribution and Marketing (R&M) and Forest Management (DoD FMR
     7000. 14-R, Vol. 11A, Chapters 7 and 16). HQ USAF centrally administers these
     programs. DFASDE does central accounting. Deposit proceeds collected from selling
     forest products to 57F3875.000*. (NOTE: asterisk represents current fiscal year.)
     Commands (except Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)) receive funds for these
     programs as part of the direct authority furnished in their operating budget authority.
        5.4.3.1.1. SAF/FMB will separately identify the amount of the authority issued to
        each command in the remarks section of their operating budget authority document.
        5.4.3.1.2. DFAS-DE will centrally make reimbursable reports for this activity.
        5.4.3.1.3. SAF/FMB will advise DFASDE of the total anticipated reimbursements
        estimated to be realized from these programs each year.
        5.4.3.1.4. Commands operating under appropriation 57*3400 and 57*3740 will
        identify these obligations in their Status of Funds Data Base Transmission, RCS:
        SAF-FM(M)7801-DE report under the functional category code and special RC/CC
        codes provided in DFAS-DER 7000.1.
     5.4.3.2. Freight Loss or Damage. Credit reimbursements from carriers to the
     appropriation from which you will replace the lost or damaged property (see Public Law
     97-258 and 10 U.S.C. 2636)). Under a working agreement, DFAS-IN credits all such
     collections that pertain to general fund appropriations as reimbursements (on a pro rata
     basis) to the central procurement appropriations. DFAS-IN credits reimbursements to
     other than general fund accounts (stock and industrial funds) to the applicable account
     and transmits them to the accountable station.
     5.4.3.3. Classified Projects. SAF/FMB processes reimbursements for certain classified
     projects.
     5.4.3.4. FMS Training. The Air Force Security Assistance Training (AFSAT)
     organization (Randolph AFB, TX) centrally manages O&M reimbursements for
     specialized FMS training performed at the MAJCOMs. Specific pricing guidance is in
     DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 15, and Appendix E of Vol. 15 (formerly in AFR 170-3).
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              89


   5.4.4. Military Personnel Appropriation:
       5.4.4.1. DoD usually requires reimbursement for labor and permanent change of station
       (PCS) when DoD provides military personnel services to non-DoD federal and non-
       federal customers. However, don’t require reimbursement when other agencies provide
       the services for DoD’s benefit, per AFI 36-2114 and departmental agreements.
       5.4.4.2. The Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) charges DWCF customers for
       military personnel labor expenses incurred by the DWCF business areas in supporting
       customer orders except for the Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF), which
       does not budget, reimburse, or include MILPERS costs in its tariff rates. The DWCF
       reimburses these amounts to the Military Personnel appropriation at the Activity level.
       See Chapter 18.
       5.4.4.3. The DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 11A, Reimbursable Operations, Policy and
       Procedures, provides additional guidance on reimbursing Military Personnel services.
5.5. Billing and Collecting Small Amounts:
   5.5.1. When an appropriated fund activity is the performer and the amount to be billed
   within the same DoD Component or to another DoD Component is less than $1,000, the
   billing may be suspended by the billing organization until the end of the fiscal year, or until
   the total billed exceeds $1,000. However, no later than the end of the fiscal year, all
   suspended amounts must be billed even though the amount to be billed is less than $1,000.
   (DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 11A, Chapter 3, Paragraph 030503. B.).
   5.5.2. Working capital funds, the Corps of Engineers Civil Works Revolving Fund, and any
   other DoD revolving fund may not waive reimbursement of any amount. This does not
   preclude identification of a central payment office by a DoD Component to pay small bills.
   (See DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 11A, Chapter 3, Paragraph 030503.A.
5.6. Reporting Instructions:
   5.6.1. See basic reporting instructions in DFAS-DE 7010.1-R (for installation level) and
   DFAS-DE 7220.3-R (for command level).
   5.6.2. See DFAS-DE 7220.1-R for 30 September certification. It gives special guidance for
   moving unfilled customer orders to the next fiscal year.
5.7. Statutory Authorities. Attachment 1 (Public Laws) to this AFI shows statutory
authorities for appropriation reimbursements commonly used in DoD.
5.8. Obtaining Materiel, Work, or Services from Others. The preceding paragraphs relate
mainly to selling materiel, work, or services to others on a reimbursable basis. However, the Air
Force also purchases materiel, work, or services from other agencies. Usually, you will use one
of the following techniques and legal authorities:
   5.8.1. Project Orders (41 U.S.C. 23). Project Orders are requests to manufacture materiel,
   supplies, and equipment or other work or services placed with and accepted by a
   government-owned and-operated (GOGO) establishment within the DoD that meets the
   criteria in DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 11A, Chapter 2. It is essential that you are aware of those
   types of efforts, listed in the DoDR, which may not be funded using a Project Order. Per
   DoD 7000.14-R, apply this guidance regardless of what form you use (including DD Form
90                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


  448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR), to request the materiel, work,
  or services. The organization or activity receiving a project order must be capable of
  manufacturing the goods or supplying the services requested on the order and not simply be a
  conduit or middleman for funds being used to procure the goods or services. Project Orders
  are authorized by 41 U.S.C. 23. They are not subject to the Economy Act. That is, obligations
  on project orders remain valid until expended or the funds cited are canceled. CompGen
  Decision B-246773 states that Project Orders are to be used only within the DoD. Issue
  project orders only on a reimbursable basis. Use the Project Order Form (AF Form 185)
  when executing orders subject to 41 U.S.C. 23. If the AF Form 185 is not available when a
  project order must be executed, the MIPR Form (DD Form 448) may be used to establish a
  project order. All project orders must include the following statement on the form: "“his
  order is placed per 41 U.S.C. 23 and DoD 7000.14-R. It is not subject to the Economy
  Act (31 U.S.C. 1535).”
     5.8.1.1. Undelivered project orders may remain as unpaid obligations of the expiring
     fiscal year appropriation even if the project orders are intrafund. In these cases, move the
     unperformed project orders (or parts of orders) from the expiring FY to the new FY for
     the performing appropriation account. Continue to categorize the moved orders as
     intrafund orders even though the transactions cross two different FY accounts, for
     example, obligations in the old FY customer account and reimbursements (accounts
     receivable sales code 39) in the new FY performing account. All activities should keep
     these unperformed project orders to a minimum at FY-end.
     5.8.1.2. Make sure that the orders are true project orders as defined in DoD 7000.14-R,
     Vol. 11A, Chapter 2. Don’t issue intrafund project orders that you know will not be
     started by FY-end. If the dollar amount at FY-end is large, consider canceling the orders
     to preclude any inference that you are using project orders to extend the life of the
     appropriation ―(parking funds‖).
  5.8.2. Economy Act Orders (31 U.S.C. 1535) (DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 11A, Chapter 3)
  (DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations). A DoD component may
  place requests for materiel, work, or services with another DoD component or another
  government agency under the Economy Act. 31 U.S.C. 1535 requires ordering agencies to
  reduce obligations recorded on the books against these reimbursable orders at the end of the
  period for which the appropriation is authorized for obligation to the extent that the agency
  ordered on hasn’t incurred obligations under that order. This statutory restriction applies only
  to Economy Act orders, which excludes FMS and grant aid orders.
  5.8.3. Orders for Procurement by Another DoD Component (10 U. S.C. 2309). These
  are requests (MIPRs or other authorized purchase requests; also see 31 U.S.C. 1535) for
  materiel, supplies, or equipment placed with another DoD component that has single service
  procurement assignment or procurement responsibilities, pursuant to an agreement
  authorized under Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, Subpart 208.70.
  5.8.4. Orders From Stock for Supplies, Materiel, or Equipment Placed on Another DoD
  Component.
  5.8.5. Orders Required by Law To Be Placed With a Government Agency. For
  example: Federal Prison Industries (18 U.S.C. 4124); Government Printing Office (44 U.S.C.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               91


   501); Corps of Engineers (33 U.S.C. 576, 701b-10); and General Services Administration
   (Federal Supply Schedule).
5.9. Deobligation, Reimbursable Economy Act Orders (31 U. S.C. 1535). Only orders
placed under Section 601 of the Economy Act are subject to deobligation as prescribed by 31
U.S.C. 1535 and implemented by DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations.
All other orders remain on the accounting records until liquidated, adjusted, or deobligated
according to normal procedures. Unless MIPRs are used as project orders, meet requirements of
a project order and DD Form 448 contains the words ―this order is placed per 41 U.S.C. 23.‖
(NOTE: Per Comptroller General Decision B196404, Military Interdepartmental Purchase
Orders (MIPRs) are issued under the Economy Act; thus the deobligation requirement applies to
MIPRs.)
5.10. Security Assistance Program Reimbursements. See DFAS-DE OPLOC and
Departmental Accounting Critical Processes, Flowcharts, Internal Management Controls,
Responsibilities, and Procedures, Section 5 at https://dfas4dod.dfas.mil/library/opr for
appropriation reimbursement policies and procedures that apply to the Security Assistance
Program, including Foreign Military Sales (FMS), the Military Assistance Program (MAP), and
the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program.

Section 5B—Appropriation Refunds

5.11. Using Refunds. Refunds are returns of advances, collections, for overpayments made,
adjustments for previous amounts disbursed, or recovery of erroneous disbursements from
appropriation of fund accounts that are directly related to, and reductions of, previously recorded
payments from the accounts‖ (Comptroller General Decision B-257905, December 26, 1995).
FM and FSO offices will treat these items (such as the recovery of a salary overpayment or a
return of the unused portion of a travel advance) as reductions of disbursements; don’t include
them as reimbursements. Refunds also include credits to an appropriation or fund account
because of accounting adjustments relating to obligations or disbursements where law or
regulation allows this procedure. Credit refunds to the same appropriation or fund account to
which you recorded the previously related expenditure. To the extent practical, give refund
vouchers the same detailed accounting classification cited on the related expenditure voucher.
5.12. Examples of Appropriation Refunds:
   5.12.1. Collections of salary overpayments. See Chapter 22.
   5.12.2. Collection of overpayments made to commercial concerns.
   5.12.3. Collections for items previously paid for but subsequently rejected and returned.
   5.12.4. Monetary consideration received on acceptance of nonconforming supplies or
   services.
   5.12.5. Collections for suspensions or disallowances by the General Accounting Office.
   5.12.6. Collections for transportation (for both persons and things) if the enlisted member,
   officer, or civilian employee must pay, in whole or part, for baggage or property transported
   in excess of allowances.

   5.12.7. Recoveries on payments for contractual services where the contracts are terminated
   and adjustments are made for the unused portion.
   5.12.8. Recoveries on unused monetary allowances in lieu of subsistence and quarters while
   in a travel status.
   5.12.9. Checks that have been recorded as a disbursement by a finance officer and which are
   subsequently returned for cancellation.
   5.12.10. Repayments against advances or loans made to contractors, and so forth.
   5.12.11. Amounts recovered as a result of price redetermination actions or other adjustments
   under contracts, including voluntary refunds by contractors.
   5.12.12. Recoveries of deposits on containers, reels, and so forth.
   5.12.13. Repayments of Air Force Academy clothing advances and advances of pay to
   military personnel.
   5.12.14. Cash receipts from redeeming trading stamps and bonus gift coupons acquired from
   appropriated fund sources.
   5.12.15. Collections from employee of lump sum leave payments on reemployment.
   5.12.16. Collections for unliquidated advanced leave.
   5.12.17. Collections for travel overadvances.
   5.12.18. Collections of refunded state gasoline taxes.
   5.12.19. Collections of witness and jury fees.
   5.12.20. Capital credit distributions of nonprofit cooperative corporations.
   5.12.21. Collections to DWCF accounting classifications pertaining to receipt of funds to
   cover government property lost or damaged (GPLD) when the DWCF controls the property.
   5.12.22. Collections for damages to military family or unaccompanied personnel housing.
   5.12.23. Recoveries collected from insurance companies, carriers, members, private parties,
   etc., pursuant to claims where the government has already paid the amount of the damage
   (For specifics on carrier recoveries see paragraph 10.64).
   5.12.24. Rebates received from approved banking institutions applicable to the Government
   Purchase Card (GPC) and Government Travel Card programs. Refunds attributable to use of
   the GPC may be credited to the appropriate accounts of the Department that are current
   when the refunds are received and that are available for the same purposes as the accounts
   originally charged and refunds attributable to the Government Travel Card may be credited
   to operation and maintenance accounts of the Department which are current when the
   refunds are received. The authority for crediting the current year in both cases is contained
   in recurring General Provisions of the annual Appropriations Act.
5.13. Refunds Receivable. To facilitate accrued expenditure and revenue accounting, FSOs
recognize refunds in the account as soon as it has been determined that a refund is due the United
States government. FSOs account for a refund receivable (except outstanding advances and
prepayments) as a reduction of accrued expenditures rather than as accrued revenue.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              93


5.14. Disposing of Refunds. Because the FSO adjusts the amount of an obligation to agree with
the amount of the expenditure at the time final payment is recorded, any subsequent adjustment
of the expenditure amount will also affect the amount of the obligation. If refunds are collected,
therefore, the net effect is to increase the unobligated and unexpended balance. Refunds that
apply to:
   5.14.1. Current annual appropriations may be reobligated during that year.
   5.14.2. Multiple-year appropriations may be reobligated during the designated years
   identified by the multiple-year citation.
   5.14.3. Continuing appropriations are identified with the program year of the original
   expenditure and become available for obligational adjustment in that program year or for
   new obligations in the current year.
   5.14.4. Expired appropriations are available for obligational adjustments to the applicable
   expired account only.
   5.14.5. Canceled appropriations are deposited to Miscellaneous Receipts of the Treasury.
5.15. Other Refunds. FM and FSO offices may also treat the following types of transactions as
appropriation refunds in the interest of accounting and reporting simplicity:
   5.15.1. Sales of services or materiel requiring reimbursement from the same appropriation,
   except when SAF/FMBM specifically authorizes intrafund reimbursements. EXAMPLES:
   Adjustments within single appropriation for support furnished tenants (if consistent with
   hosttenant funding policies specified in Chapter 7) and medical activities.
   5.15.2. Accounting adjustments for temporary charges made to an appropriation that is
   subsequently charged to another appropriation or to funds of another agency (see OMB
   Circular A-34 and Public Law 89-473).
   5.15.3. Certain refunds pertaining to government bills of lading and transportation requests
   credited by the Transportation Division, DFAS-IN, to special refund accounts prescribed by
   AFMAN 65-604, rather than to the detailed accounting classifications originally charged.
   DFAS-DE centrally administers these special refund accounts (see DFAS-DE 7010.1-R and
   DFAS-DE 7010.2-R).
   5.15.4. You may recover recoupments of utility connection charges through credits applied
   at a predetermined rate against billings submitted by the utility supplier (see AFI 32-1061
   and DFAS-DE 7010.2-R). Credit amounts so recovered to the current operation and
   maintenance appropriation financing the utility service rather than the construction
   appropriation that financed the connection costs.

Section 5C—Administrative and Accessorial Costs

5.16. Special Guidance. Apply this section and Figure 5.1 to determine and charge
administrative and accessorial expenses. Administrative costs include items such as fees for
copying, certifying, and searching records or other documents. See DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 11A,
Chapter 1 (Addendum 1) and Chapter 4. Accessorial costs include costs related to issuing,
selling, shipping and transferring supplies, equipment, and other materiel to non-Air Force
activities. Don’t use this guidance for the USAF Security Assistance Program (see DFAS-DE
 94                                                 AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


OPLOC AND departmental Accounting critical processes, flowcharts, Internal Management
Controls, Responsibilities and Procedures, Section 5 at https://dfas4dod.dfas.mil/library/opr/).
See Figure 5.1 for accessorial descriptions and percentage rates.
   5.16.1. Accessorial expenses include packing, crating, transportation, and port
   loading/unloading. The Air Force may incur them for direct delivery of items from contractor
   facilities and items furnished from Air Force stocks. Vendors usually include accessorial
   expenses for direct delivery items in the items’ contract price. If the contractor separately
   bills for accessorial costs of direct delivery items, reimburse for them per these instructions.
   5.16.2. Don’t charge other DoD components for accessorial costs. EXCEPTION: Charge
   DWCF or other working capital funds.
   5.16.3. Generally, credit reimbursements to the current operating agency and appropriation
   accounts in which the expenses were incurred, unless otherwise specified by law.
   5.16.4. Air Force activities will budget for projected reimbursable accessorial and
   administrative charges. See DFAS-DE 7010.2-R for billing procedures.
   5.16.5. Treat the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) the same as other DoD components for billing
   accessorial charges.
5.17. Charging Accessorial Costs. Use the guidance and rates in this paragraph and Figure 5.1
to determine charges for accessorial costs. Non-DoD agencies must reimburse the Air Force for
any part of the accessorial costs not included in the standard price of the item or paid directly
from funds cited by the buyer. Ensure that you don’t duplicate accessorial charges financed by
direct citation of the customer agency’s funds or included in the standard prices of reimbursable
issues.
   5.17.1. Charges for transportation costs not included in standard prices or financed from
   funds cited by the buyer are from point of shipment to the point at which consignee accepts
   delivery.
       5.17.1.1. Air Force DWCF (formerly stock fund) sales are at a standard price, which
       includes a surcharge for transportation, Distribution Depot, and Inventory Control Point
       expenses. See Table 18.1, Table 18.2 and Table 18.3 for TWCF transportation funding
       responsibilities (FDT and SDT). Customers or users pay this standard price to the
       applicable Supply Management division of the DWCF. If the Air Force supplier incurs
       any additional costs (second destination transportation, packing, crating, handling, etc.),
       bill such costs to the purchaser for reimbursement of the Air Force appropriation bearing
       such costs at either standard percentage or actual cost.
       5.17.1.2. Returns to the DWCF Supply Management divisions are creditable or
       noncreditable according to directives prescribing the returns. These DWCF credits may
       offset later billings for DWCF sales. Pay any accessorial costs (packing, crating,
       handling, overseas inland transportation) incurred for the creditable returns from the
       funds of the activity returning the materiel. If an Air Force appropriation pays accessorial
       costs, then the DWCF Division reimburses the Air Force appropriation and reduces the
       credit, if this is the most efficient and acceptable way of handling these costs. An
       alternative would be to have the DWCF Division give credit as usual, and have the
       appropriation bearing the expense collect directly from the activity returning the item.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             95


       5.17.1.3. When you sell or transfer items procured locally to a non-DoD activity, include
       only the accessorial cost elements you actually incur.
       5.17.1.4. The FSO must add an accessorial charge when authorized non-DoD
       charge sale customers purchase items in overseas commissaries. The FSO collects
       the accessorial charge from the customer.
   5.17.2. USAF supply activities making shipments to non-USAF activities must ensure that
   they show correct coded shipping designators on shipping documents (or substitute media)
   covering overseas surface shipments as prescribed in AFMAN 23-110. To facilitate billing
   for shipments by the TWCF business area (formerly DBOF-T), transportation account codes
   must be reflected on all shipping documents.

1. Packing, crating, and handling at storage depot or manufacturer for direct 3.50
deliveries. (Notes 2, 3)
2. Parcel post (CONUS destinations) is not additive to other CONUS 3.75
transportation rates; it is additive to overseas transportation.
3. CONUS transportation.                                                      3.75
4. CONUS port unloading and handling.                                         2.50
5. Overseas inland transportation.                                            3.00
6. Overseas port unloading and handling.                                      1.00
7. Ocean transportation from CONUS to:
Alaska, Hawaii, Europe, Latin America, and Mediterranean Ports                4.00
Newfoundland, Labrador, Thule, Iceland, South America (east and west 6.00
coast), Far East, African Ports (other than Mediterranean), and Near East.
1. Percentages are applicable to billing price of materiel shipped or inventory price of materiel
   issued without reimbursement. These rates will not be arbitrarily applied to the acquisition
   price of all items having a unit value of $10,000 or over. Instead, actual or estimated costs
   will be used when determination is made by the supplying agency that a lower and more
   equitable charge results.
2. Source item packing is distinguished from cargo assembling, packing, and preservation, such
   as shipments placed in sea vans or trailer vans at ports of embarkation. These latter services
   are normally performed by the purchasing DoD Component. When such services are
   performed by the selling DoD Component, use actual or estimated costs as the basis for
   reimbursement.
3. Storage charges are billed to all non-DoD customers for customer owned materiel, which is
   held for 30 days or more. Storage charges are determined at the end of each 30-day period. A
 96                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   uniform DoD annual rate of .015 or .00125 percent monthly of the average value of
   customer-owned materiel is charged unless a commercial storage rate or actual cost is
   applicable.
5.18. Contract Cost Billings. When you let contracts as part of a reimbursable agreement, bill
the benefiting organization for costs incurred for awarding the contract.
   5.18.1. Bill the cost of Government-furnished materiel in addition to contract costs.
   5.18.2. When the contract is provided to meet the requirements of a non-Federal
   Government organization, the contractor must reimburse the Air Force a rental charge for the
   use of plant or production equipment the Air Force utilizes in manufacturing the item being
   sold.
   5.18.3. Bill contract administration charges to other Federal agencies and private parties at
   the hourly rate established by DoD Comptroller per statutory or guidance requirements.
   Don’t bill these charges within a DoD component or to another DoD component.
   5.18.4. Bill non-DoD activities for DoD personnel services in support of contracts described
   above.

                                           Chapter 6

                    EXPIRED AND CANCELED APPROPRIATIONS

6.1. Applying this Chapter. Follow this chapter in approving upward obligation adjustments
and in using current appropriations to fund payments and adjustments related to canceled
appropriations. The contract change rules for charging prior year funds for within-scope changes
became effective 8 April 1992. Don’t make retroactive adjustments except as directed by
SAF/FMB.
6.2. Applying Changes in the Appropriation Life Cycle:
   6.2.1. Maintain fiscal year identity indefinitely for appropriations that had not transferred to
   the ―M‖ accounts as of 5 November 1990 (P.L. 101510). DoD requires fiscal year identity to
   meet statutory requirements and line item detail to meet reporting requirements concerning
   the use of current appropriations. See paragraph 6.8 for related Antideficiency Act
   violations.
   6.2.2. Don’t record obligations as hedges against future contingencies; these aren’t valid
   obligations. Financial Management and Comptroller (FM) and Financial Services Office
   (FSO) offices should rescind these obligations as part of certification procedures at the end of
   each fiscal year. See requirements for recording obligations in DFAS-DE Interim Guidance
   on Accounting for Obligations, which are unchanged.
6.3. Determining Contract Changes and Upward Obligation Adjustments (UOA) (P.L.
101-510, 31 U.S.C. 1553). It is the intent of Congress to monitor within-scope changes made by
government agencies to contracts funded in expired years and canceled appropriations. This is
performed through the review process mandated by Public Law 101-510.
   6.3.1. Under the law, the DoD Comptroller (USD(C)) must approve within-scope contract
   changes if:
       6.3.1.1. The change requires additional work by the contractor, and
       6.3.1.2. It may be financed with prior year funds, and
       6.3.1.3. The funds required for the program, project, or activity (PPA) exceed $4 million
       during a fiscal year (cumulative on the PPA throughout the fiscal year). DoD(C) must
       notify the Congress of changes that exceed $25 million. (NOTE: DoD(C) must review
       any adjustment to the PPA above the $4 million threshold including items under $100
       thousand.)
   6.3.2. Use paragraph 6.3 and the decision tree at Figure 6.1 to distinguish within-scope
   contract changes that may require reporting to Congress or DoD(C) from other upward
   obligation adjustments. Figure 6.1 also includes a third category, changes in contract
   scope. (NOTE: Public Law 101-510 states that the type of contract change you may charge
   to an expired account is ―a change to a contract under which the contractor is required to
   perform additional work. Such term does not include adjustments to pay claims or increases
   under an escalation clause.‖ The contract provides for these latter adjustments, which aren’t
   ―contract changes.‖ Charge such adjustments to the account cited on the original contract.)
98                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


     6.3.2.1. All upward obligation adjustments that are considered ordinary and within-scope
     contract changes and/or involve a canceled year account must be processed using the
     automated OARS (Obligation Adjustment Reporting system) program. SAF/FMBMM
     and SAF/FMBIC must review all UOAs for appropriations 7040 (Military Family
     Housing), 3300 (Military Construction), 0500 (Defense-Wide Construction, and 0103
     (BRAC 88) Budget Program 100 and 200. UOA requests in any amount for these
     appropriations must be submitted in OARS.
  6.3.3. Use the three categories mentioned in paragraph 6.3.2 (and related situations) and
  Figure 6.1 as tools for analyzing contract changes and other prior year obligation
  adjustments. The types of transactions in paragraph 6.3 are not all inclusive; they highlight
  areas common to most AF activities. Commands must review unique transactions in light of
  P.L. 101-510, DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations, applicable
  Comptroller General Decisions, the bona fide need rule, and this chapter. P.L. 101-510
  doesn’t alter the Comptroller General role. Document Comptroller General decisions in
  making determinations and recommendations for processes unique to your command. Also,
  use the bona fide need rule to evaluate all within scope and change in contract scope
  transactions. (See DFAS-DE 7000.4-R, Section B, for more on bona fide need.) SAF/FMB
  will evaluate all contract change and upward obligation adjustment requests in light of the
  bona fide need rule regardless of the requester’s identified condition.
  6.3.4. If your request for a contract change or upward obligation adjustment contains more
  than one condition or action, you should separately identify each action in the OARS
  package to speed processing.
  6.3.5. Paragraphs 6.4 and 6.5 address funding of the transaction; paragraph 6.6 covers
  approval procedures.
  6.3.6. Category One: Upward Obligation Adjustments are not contract changes as
  described in paragraph 6.3.2 and don’t require DoD or Congressional review. Use current
  year funds if the funds from the related obligation have been canceled. See paragraphs 6.4
  and 6.5 for more funding guidance. The following types of transactions normally fall into
  this category:
     6.3.6.1. Award and incentive fees.
     6.3.6.2. Correcting administrative errors. Includes obligations properly recorded and
     then erroneously deobligated by contracting or a designated contracting representative;
     correcting procuring contracting officer (PCO) errors discovered after the contract is
     signed; and recording of payments made before the appropriation is closed but not
     recorded by the accountable station until after closure (in-transit).
     6.3.6.3. Correcting accounting errors. Includes an obligation that was properly
     recorded and then erroneously deobligated by accounting (accounting didn’t record a
     valid obligation); and establishing or maintaining erroneous accounts or refund
     receivables, whenever you require funding to cover approved accounts or refund
     receivable write-offs.
     6.3.6.4. Price inflation adjustments included in the original contract clause (economic
     and escalation price adjustments); labor wage redeterminations; and cost sharing per
     contract clause ratios.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               99


     6.3.6.5. Ratification Actions. These occur when an unauthorized officer or employee
     incurs an obligation, which becomes binding on the Air Force and is ratified under AF
     FAR Supplement 5301.602-3. This can occur when an employee knowingly allows a
     contractor to do work outside the contract’s specifications without certifying fund
     availability and procurement authorization. Charge the appropriation and fiscal year that
     would have been charged had the obligation been valid from the beginning (DFAS-DE
     Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations, DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 14, CG Decision
     20-208730, 1983).
     6.3.6.6. Foreign currency fluctuations (see paragraph 6.9).
     6.3.6.7. Claims. In most cases, FSOs should obligate claims for meritorious claims
     (under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978) against the appropriation on the contract. But,
     FM offices must analyze each claim on its own merits to determine which funds to
     obligate to cover the Government’s liability. In every case, consider applying the bona
     fide need rule to determine which appropriate fiscal year to charge funds against.
     EXCEPTIONS:
        6.3.6.7.1. If you pay a claim from the statutory Judgment Fund as a result of a
        decision by the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) or the United
        States Claims Court, charge the Air Force’s reimbursement to the Judgment Fund to
        appropriations current on the date of the board’s or court’s decision. (DFAS-DE
        Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations, Paragraph 28). Judgement Fund
        claims paid from current year funds are not counted against the 1% limitation for
        paying canceled bills with current year funds. Do not submit Judgement fund
        reimbursements involving current years through OARS, as this will cause an
        erroneous adjustment to the 1% limit.
        6.3.6.7.2. Under 10 U.S.C. 2863 and notwithstanding any other provision of law, you
        may pay meritorious contractor claims that arise under military construction or family
        housing contracts from any unobligated funds appropriated and available for these
        two kinds of projects. So, don’t fund claims on construction projects, including
        O&M-funded minor construction projects, from the project amounts, and don’t count
        these against statutory limits.
     6.3.6.8. Definitization of undefinitized contractual actions (UCA), such as letter
     contracts or unpriced orders, after the appropriation expires. (The term UCA includes any
     action entered into when final terms, specifications, or price are not agreed upon before
     work begins.) Continually update definitization schedules for all UCAs issued. UCAs are
     new contracts for which the contract terms, specifications, or price are not agreed upon
     before performance is begun under the action. UCAs do not include within-scope
     contract modifications and do not apply to foreign military sales, purchases under
     $25,000, special access programs, or Congressionally mandated long-lead procurement
     contracts. Prior to amendment by the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of
     1994, no more than fifty percent (50%) of the overall ceiling price could be expended
     prior to definitization. SAF/GCA has ruled that the original obligations incurred under
     the letter contracts are valid and properly chargeable to the original fiscal year. Therefore,
     all obligations made on letter contracts prior to the passage of the FASA of 1994 are valid
     obligations of the fiscal year in which the letter contracts were signed, as long as those
100                                                 AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


      obligations did not exceed the amount in the Limitation of Government Liability clause
      in the letter contracts. With the passage of the FASA of 1994, the Act restricted the
      amount that may be obligated at the time a letter contract is signed to 50% of the overall
      ceiling price. This virtually guarantees that there will be additional obligations at the time
      of definitization. If definitization takes place in a subsequent fiscal year, those
      additional obligations are chargeable to the appropriation current at the time of
      definitization, without regard to whether the current appropriation is a multiple or
      one-year appropriation.
      6.3.6.9. Provisioning Item Orders (PIO) price definitization. Some contracts contain
      options, which allow activities to issue provisioning orders for items such as spares,
      repair parts, or aerospace ground equipment. Record obligations at the time your
      organization issues the SF 30, Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract, to
      the contractor. Charge price definitizations that require additional obligations to the same
      appropriation charged on the initial order provided the scope of the order doesn’t change.
      PIOs that change scope or incorporate new ECPs (Engineering Change Proposals) must
      be charged to appropriations current when the scope was changed or the ECP accepted.
      6.3.6.10. Contract overruns. Evaluate each transaction against the bona fide need rule
      to determine the proper fiscal year to charge, especially on contracts with multiple
      modifications over several fiscal years. If a contract modification has increased its scope
      and work on the additional effort results in an overrun, fund the overrun from
      appropriations available for obligation at the time of the contract modification, which
      increased the scope of the contract.
      6.3.6.11. Contract closeout costs. Evaluate each transaction against the bona fide need
      rule to determine the proper fiscal year to charge, especially on contracts with multiple
      modifications spanning several fiscal years. If a contract modification increased the scope
      of the contract and you need to fund closeout costs relating to work on the additional
      effort, fund these costs from appropriations available for obligation at the time of the
      contract modification which increased the scope of the contract.
      6.3.6.12. Incentive contracts funded from target to ceiling. If cost growth from target
      to ceiling results from following the contract’s terms and conditions, fund with the same
      appropriation obligated on the contract. Some examples are: negotiation of final overhead
      rates, scrap and rework, and configuration updates.
      6.3.6.13. Contingency items (within the scope of the contract). Contract provisions
      may authorize the government to require more work on facilities, maintenance, repairs
      and parts, etc. Fund with the same appropriation used for the original obligation.
      6.3.6.14. Contract defaults resulting in reprocurement contract actions. If you
      require a reprocurement action that will result in a replacement contract, you may fund it
      from the same fiscal year funds as the related obligation if:
         6.3.6.14.1. The Air Force has a continuing bona fide need for the goods or services
         involved.
         6.3.6.14.2. The original contract was made in good faith.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             101


         6.3.6.14.3. The original contract was terminated for default or for the convenience of
         the Government. If for the convenience of the Government, the termination was the
         result of a court order, a determination by a contracting officer that the contract award
         was improper when there is explicit evidence that the award was erroneous, and when
         the determination is documented with appropriate findings of fact and of law, or a
         determination by other competent authority (e.g., the General Accounting Office or a
         Board of Contract Appeals) that the contract award was improper.
         6.3.6.14.4. The replacement contract is substantially of the same size and scope as
         the original contract; executed without undue delay after the original contract is
         terminated; awarded to a different contractor.
  6.3.7. Category Two: WithinScope Contract Changes includes contract changes that you
  can charge to expired accounts and which the Air Force may have to submit to DoD(C) and
  Congress for approval. For withinscope contract changes, use the same fiscal year funds as
  for the related obligation unless you cannot satisfy the bona fide need rule for the same year.
  Use current year funds if funds on the related obligation have been canceled and the account
  is closed. See paragraphs 6.4 and 6.5 for more guidance. Examples of changes that are
  normally withinscope are:
     6.3.7.1. Any contract modification that requires the contractor to do more withinscope
     work.
     6.3.7.2. Increased costs because of differing site conditions.
     6.3.7.3. Engineering change proposals (ECP), Value Engineering Change Proposals
     (VECP), solicited or unsolicited, and Contract Change Proposals. Because these
     proposals may result in changes of contract scope, analyze each situation separately to
     determine the proper funds to cover the Government’s liability.
     6.3.7.4. Change orders to cost reimbursement contracts with a limitation cost or
     limitation of funds clause that do not cause the contract ceiling to be exceeded and are
     otherwise based on antecedent liability shall be funded from the appropriation used to
     originally fund the contract.
     6.3.7.5. Change orders to cost reimbursement contracts with a limitation of cost or
     limitation of funds clause that cause the contract ceiling to be exceeded, and which are
     not based on antecedent liability, enforceable by the contractor, shall be charged to
     funds legally available when the contracting officer grants the discretionary increase.
  6.3.8. Category Three: Change in Contract Scope. When contract changes increase the
  contract’s scope, fund the additional work from appropriations available for current
  obligation. The Air Force doesn’t have to report these transactions to DoD or Congress under
  P.L. 101-510. See paragraphs 6.4, 6.5 and DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Accopunting for
  Obligations for more funding guidance. Whether the contract scope has changed depends on
  the unique facts and circumstances of each situation; analyze each case separately to make
  this determination. Examples of situations which change the contract’s scope are:
     6.3.8.1. Increases in quantities.
     6.3.8.2. Modifications of service contracts that increase deliverable services or reports.
     6.3.8.3. Increase to the number of hours to be worked.
   102                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


         6.3.8.4. Extended periods of performance. But, determine the scope based on how the
         revised delivery schedule affects work on the contract. If the extension doesn’t materially
         alter the contract’s purpose and scope, any resultant increase in obligations (e.g., stretch-
         out of labor costs) remains a bona fide need to the prior year. Conversely, clearly new
         efforts (e.g., storage costs not contemplated in the contract) would potentially be beyond
         scope, current year costs. Make a final determination regarding within scope or beyond
         scope after evaluating the unique contractual circumstances.
         6.3.8.5. Changes to form, fit, or function of end items beyond the scope of the original
         specifications.
         6.3.8.6. Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), Value Engineering Change Proposals
         (VECP), solicited or unsolicited, and Contract Change Proposals. Note that these
         situations may also be within scope contract changes.
     6.3.9. This chapter doesn’t address funding procedures for contract options because they
     aren’t considered prior year transactions; you finance contract options when exercised.
     Follow this chapter’s guidance on upward obligation adjustments when the funds related to
     the exercised option expire or are canceled.

   (*)Some situations may require the use of current year funding.
  6.4. Using Current and Expired Appropriations.
      6.4.1. Using Current Appropriations:
          6.4.1.1. Pursuant to P.L. 101-510, use current appropriations to finance payment of
          obligations and upward obligation adjustments against canceled account years. However,
          the Air Force may not use more than one-percent of each current appropriation over the
          appropriation’s life to finance canceled obligations and upward obligation adjustments.
          See paragraph 6.5 for administering the one-percent limitation. The one-percent
          limitation is administered by SAF/FM and automatically tracked in OARS.
 104                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       6.4.1.2. You must use currently available appropriations for changes in contract scope.
       Follow applicable reprogramming procedures when the source of funds is from a
       different budget line than the requirement. See paragraph 6.14 for more reprogramming
       guidance.
   6.4.2. Using Expired Appropriations:
       6.4.2.1. After an appropriation expires, you may use the unobligated balance plus any
       deobligations to finance valid adjustments until the appropriation closes at the end of the
       fifth expired year. Don’t use current year funds to finance adjustments applicable to
       expired years.
       6.4.2.2. Paying stations must be aware of accounts about to be closed. When the paying
       office receives a request for payment of an obligation, they must ensure the funds cited
       are available and the disbursement can be made before the account closes. Use current
       year funds if you can’t pay before cancellation of the account.
          6.4.2.2.1. If the funds cited are from a closed appropriation, the paying office must
          request a new (current) fund citation from the accountable office before disbursement.
          Fund the payment of obligations against a closed appropriation from current
          appropriations made available by the accountable office.
          6.4.2.2.2. Don’t authorize payment against an appropriation account which has been
          closed. That is a reportable violation of the Antideficiency Act under DoD 7000.14-
          R, Vol. 14, Administrative Control of Funds and Antideficiency Act Violations.
          6.4.2.2.3. Except for the Military Construction and Family Housing Construction
          appropriations (3300 and 7040/0740) and DoD appropriations (Treasury Index Code
          97), MAJCOM/ FOA/ DRU comptrollers of the accountable office may approve
          using current funds to make these payments for amounts of $2,000,000 or less.
          SAF/FMBIC must review both 3300 and 7040/0740 related transactions of
          $2,000,000 and under prior to action. Process transactions exceeding $2,000,000
          according to paragraph 6.6. For within-scope contract changes and DoD
          appropriations, the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU comptroller approval limit is for
          adjustments of $100,000 or less.
          6.4.2.2.4. MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs must also comply with any restrictions
          incorporated in statute and on the most recent funding documents (including
          Congressional Special Interest restrictions). These limitations continue in effect
          following expiration of the appropriation.
   6.4.3. Operating Agency Responsibility. The operating agency to which the original funds
   were issued will provide sources of current appropriations for payments and upward
   adjustments relating to closed appropriations. If the operating agency responsible for the
   program has changed, e.g., the establishment of Air Force Special Operations Command, the
   operating agency currently responsible for the program must provide current appropriation
   sources.
6.5. Controlling Current Appropriation Limitations:
   6.5.1. Checking the Original Appropriation. Under the law, the total of current funds
   used to finance upward adjustments to canceled appropriations can’t cause the total
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            105


  obligations and expenditures for the canceled appropriation to exceed the amount originally
  appropriated to it. This requirement applies to appropriations that expired at the end of FY 89
  and after.
  6.5.2. Complying With the One-Percent Limitation. P.L. 101-510 permits DoD activities
  to use current appropriations to fund canceled obligations where payment is imminent in the
  current fiscal year. The law limits this authority to one percent of each current appropriation
  during that appropriation’s life.
     6.5.2.1. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will footnote the one- percent
     limitation on Air Force apportionment documents. However, OMB, DoD, and the Air
     Force won’t withhold funds based on this footnote. Generally, MAJCOMs should not
     withhold funds either. It is mandatory that all upward obligation adjustments for canceled
     year bills be recorded in the Obligation Adjustment Reporting System (OARS),
     regardless of dollar amount. OARS automatically tracks the one- percent limitation.
     6.5.2.2. SAF/FMBMM won’t issue to the field a limitation related to payments or
     upward obligation adjustments exceeding $2,000,000. Approval thresholds for payments
     and upward obligation adjustments have been established in OARS.
     6.5.2.3. While the one- percent limitation is a ceiling, SAF/FMB doesn’t withhold
     funding. You must provide funding sources when it requires current appropriations to
     fund obligations related to canceled accounts for which payment is imminent. Consult
     with the SAF/FMB appropriation manager when funding is unavailable at the
     MAJCOM/FOA/DRU.
     6.5.2.4. These ceilings are limitations subject to the Antideficiency Act. Report
     violations under DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 14.
     6.5.2.5. Use ESP Code ZC when you obligate current year appropriations to fund
     canceled account obligations and expenditures which you would have charged to the M
     account prior to its elimination.
     6.5.2.6. Any canceled year adjustment request which cumulatively reduces the current
     year availability of a procurement or RDT&E BPAC by 50 percent or more of the
     originally enacted amount (adjusted for reprogramming, transfers in/out, supplementals
     and rescissions) must be forwarded to SAF/FMBMM for prior approval. This includes all
     proposed adjustments, including those under $100,000 which would cumulatively exceed
     this threshold. OARS will automatically track this level.
  6.5.3. Approving Upward Adjustments and Contract Changes:
     6.5.3.1. For other than the 7040/0740 and 3300 appropriations, MAJCOM/FOA/DRU
     comptrollers will approve using current year funds to cover canceled account
     requirements and contract changes that are for no more than $2,000,000 (except for
     within scope contract changes, DoD appropriation adjustments for which the limitation is
     no more than $100,000, and any canceled year availability of a procurement or RDT&E
     BPAC by $3.999M or more of the originally enacted amount {adjusted for
     reprogrammings, transfers in or out, supplementals and rescission }). MAJCOMs may
     redelegate approval below the command level, but their procedures must clearly identify
 106                                             AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       and periodically review such adjustments at MAJCOM level. See paragraph 6.6.2 for
       reporting requirements.
       6.5.3.2. For the Military Construction and Military Family Housing appropriations (3300
       and 7040 (see paragraph 21.18 for MFH Construction symbol change for FY 02 and
       out)), SAF/ FMBIC must approve all upward adjustments of $100,000 and below. For
       upward obligation adjustments over $100,000 in these accounts, follow procedures in
       paragraph 6.6.
       6.5.3.3. SAF/FMBMM will retain Air Force approval authority for using current
       appropriations to fund:
          6.5.3.3.1. Payments against canceled appropriations exceeding $2,000,000.
          6.5.3.3.2. All upward obligation adjustments exceeding $2,000,000.
          6.5.3.3.3. Within scope contract changes exceeding $100,000.
          6.5.3.3.4. Adjustments to DoD appropriations (Treasure Index Code 97) exceeding
          $100,000.
       6.5.3.4. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU comptrollers must recommend and designate current
       appropriation sources when requesting approval. Follow the process identified in
       paragraph 6.6.
6.6. Approving Upward Obligation Adjustments and Contract Change Requests:
   6.6.1. SAF/FMBMM must approve adjustments, including transactions to correct accounting
   errors greater than $2,000,000 ($100,000 for within scope contract changes and DoD
   appropriations) that involve any individual action or contract, before the accounting office
   records the adjustment in the accounting records. Don’t net upward adjustments against
   downward adjustments to avoid this approval requirement.
   6.6.2. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU comptrollers must provide SAF/FMBMM with the information
   in OARS when requesting adjustment and contract change approvals.
   6.6.3. SAF/FMBIC must review all 3300 and 7040/0740 appropriation requests for $100,000
   and below. The limitation for within scope contract change and DoD appropriation
   adjustments is $100,000. MAJCOMs may re-delegate approval, provided the MAJCOM
   establishes MAJCOM-level procedures to clearly identify and periodically review the
   transactions. MAJCOMs must maintain supporting documentation to fulfill reporting
   requirements to DoD(C) and Congress on these adjustments. Before approving or forwarding
   any requests, MAJCOMs must ensure that lower levels have reviewed them.
   6.6.4. If you’re at a base, forward inquiries on the status of requests to your
   MAJCOM/FOA/DRU. The status of any adjustment you have worked on can be reviewed at
   anytime in OARS. SAF/ FMBMM will answer MAJCOM/FOA/DRU budget office
   inquiries. SAF/FMB will not respond to contractor inquiries; direct those inquiries to
   the program offices.
   6.6.5. If you’re at a MAJCOM or installation FM, work with FSO and paying offices to
   ensure prompt obligation and liquidation of amounts approved for upward adjustment to
   expired or canceled appropriations.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               107


   6.6.6. Timing of requests for adjustment. SAF/FMB will work emergency requests for
   valid urgent requirements case-by-case. MAJCOMs should routinely submit requests for
   upward adjustments at least two weeks in advance of the need, to allow time for staffing. At
   fiscal year-end, after the first week in September, discuss any request with SAF/FMBMM
   prior to submission. At fiscal year-end, the MAJCOM must ensure that upward obligation
   adjustments citing expiring year or canceling account funds will be obligated and expensed
   prior to fiscal year-end. If not, the adjustment will have to be resubmitted the next fiscal year
   for approval by SAF/FMBMM.
6.7. Processing Unrecorded Obligations and Payments:
   6.7.1. Commands and bases must use current appropriations to finance any obligation which
   was not recorded prior to closure of the appropriation and must process such transactions as
   upward obligation adjustments. Also, MAJCOMs and bases will treat an obligation which
   was properly recorded and then erroneously deobligated by contracting or a designated
   contracting representative as a correction of an administrative error (see paragraph 6.3.6.2
   for more information about administrative errors). If the erroneously deobligated obligation
   pertains to a closed appropriation, follow guidance in paragraph 6.4.1
   6.7.2. Unmatched disbursements for closed accounts. Treat any payment that occurred
   prior to the cancellation of an appropriation but was not recorded in the official accounting
   and finance records of the accountable station before the date of closure as an administrative
   error. Correction of the error condition will not constitute a violation of the Antideficiency
   Act. This includes ―by-other‖ payment cycles where the paying station makes payment in a
   fiscal year prior to account closure, but the accountable station doesn’t complete the cycle
   until the next fiscal year when the account is closed.
   6.7.3. Accounting error corrections. MAJCOMs must send accounting error corrections
   over $2 million to SAF/FMBMM using OARS. If a disbursement or collection was made in
   error to the wrong appropriation and that appropriation canceled before adjusting the
   accounting records, an adjustment may be made to the canceled appropriation. Comptroller
   General Decision B-251287.3, issued November 1, 1995 allows the Treasury to accept
   adjustments to canceled accounts as long as the transaction needing adjustment occurred
   before the account closed. This situation is most likely to arise through NULO research,
   validation of canceled bills/invoices, correction of an unrecorded or improperly charged
   disbursement from a wrong appropriation or in a contract reconciliation. These adjustments
   would be processed through the DFAS Denver accounting systems and treated, most often,
   as memorandum type adjustments and are not treated as UOAs. Canceled account obligations
   and receivables that were not disbursed or collected until after the account canceled will
   continue to be charged to current year funds or collected in the Miscellaneous Receipt
   Account, 3200.
6.8. Complying with the Antideficiency Act. In accordance with DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 14, the
following are reportable violations of the Antideficiency Act:
   6.8.1. Total obligations, including adjustments to obligations, exceed the original
   appropriation. (NOTE: the cumulative fund resources of the original appropriation consist of
   amounts appropriated, net authorized transfers, and realized reimbursements from inception
   of the appropriation.) This includes any obligation against an appropriation or fund account
   exceeding the amount available in the original appropriation or fund account. This applies to
 108                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   all appropriation accounts, the obligated balance of which had not transferred to the ―M‖
   account as of 5 November 1990. As a result of the new law, all appropriation accounts retain
   fiscal year identity indefinitely.
   6.8.2. New obligations or expenditures in canceled accounts. Includes any obligations or
   expenditures against an appropriation account canceled pursuant to sections 1552, 1555,
   1557 of Title 31, United States Code.
   6.8.3. Total obligations, or adjustments to obligations, exceed the amount apportioned or
   allotted. This includes any obligation against any appropriation or fund exceeding the amount
   apportioned or allotted to the original appropriation or fund account.
   6.8.4. All aspects of the Antideficiency Act still apply to fund limitations. The one- percent
   limitation is a single, cumulative limit. Agencies may not use more than one percent of
   unexpired funds to pay any combination of canceled obligations (OMB Bulletin No. 9107).
   6.8.5. All upward obligation adjustments involving an ADA violation investigation or
   potential ADA violation must be submitted to SAF/FMBMM for approval, regardless of
   dollar amount. Timely submission of reports and upward obligation adjustment requests are
   essential to preclude the Air Force from being subjected to ADA violation investigations
   arising from exceeding the legal limitations or otherwise over obligating or over disbursing
   an appropriation.
   6.8.6. The use of current availability for expired account adjustments. A violation of
   the Antideficiency Act occurs whenever an upward obligation adjustment falls within the
   parameters of Section 1004 of the FY 93 National Defense Authorization Act. If the one-
   percent limitation on the use of the current year appropriation under Section 1004 is
   exceeded, this is a reportable Antideficiency Act violation.
   6.8.7. Exceeding the $4/25M threshold for within-scope contract changes. Within-scope
   contract changes above $4M of expired/canceled funds require USD(C) approval and those
   changes above $25M require Congressional notification. This is at the program, project, and
   activity level and is cumulative during a fiscal year. Report a violation if the $4M or $25M
   thresholds are exceeded without prior approval from USD(C) or Congress, respectively.
   6.8.8. An increased focus on Antideficiency Act (ADA) violation investigations and recent
   DoD policy on disciplinary actions to be taken have prompted the need for closer
   surveillance of those upward obligation adjustments associated with potential Antideficiency
   Act violations.
6.9. Handling Foreign Currency Fluctuation Obligations and Payments:
   6.9.1. Apply these procedures for making a payment from an expired or canceled account
   when the foreign currency exchange rate is higher or lower than the established budget rate.
   6.9.2. Apply current procedures for using the foreign currency fluctuation Centrally
   Managed Allotment (CMA) during the five expired years after the period of availability for
   obligation ends. Once the account is canceled, follow procedures in paragraph 6.9.3.
   6.9.3. When expired accounts are canceled, make the payments related to the canceled
   accounts from current year appropriations. Paying offices will disburse canceled obligations
   involving designated foreign currencies by charging the basic appropriation at the current-
   year budget rate and charging or crediting the CMA for the difference between the budget
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             109


   rate and the current rate. As stated above, only the amount charged to the basic appropriation
   affects the one- percent limitation.
   6.9.4. SAF/FMBMM must approve any proposed upward obligation adjustment to the
   foreign currency CMA exceeding $2,000,000 prior to recording in the accounting system.
   Provide the same information required by paragraph 6.6.
6.10. Using Other DoD Appropriations:
   6.10.1. Per DoD Comptroller, in executing Public Law 101-510 requirements, the Military
   Departments must scrutinize all budget authority (appropriations) executed through the Air
   Force, including non-expenditure transfers (identified by the government agency
   appropriation symbol code 97) with the same attention we provide AF appropriations. Non-
   AF DoD activities provide these appropriations for Air Force projects and the Air Force
   retains control of them.
   6.10.2. Apply the procedures regarding upward obligation adjustments, including
   SAF/FMBMM review of changes over $100,000, for the DoD appropriations as specified in
   this guidance. All financial managers must ensure that the obligations recorded don’t exceed
   the amounts authorized by law. Air Force activities must also charge valid upward obligation
   adjustments related to canceled DoD accounts to current 97-coded appropriations.
6.11. Obligating Upward Adjustments in the Accounting System:
   6.11.1. Perform these checks and balances prior to recording the obligation. First, determine
   whether there is a valid obligation. DFAS-DE 7000.4-R permits recording only those
   transactions which meet specified standards for legitimate obligations. Section 2 of DFAS-
   DE Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations further defines these standards. Second,
   apply the bona fide need rule in determining the proper appropriation and fiscal year for the
   fund citation. Application of the rule depends largely on the facts and circumstances of the
   specific case. Assist the FSO or Field Organization in selecting the correct fund citation.
   6.11.2. Use available sources such as statutes, regulations or higher headquarters direction in
   determining the correct fund citation. For example, when there appears to be a lack of funds
   at the base level to cover an obligation related to an expired account, MAJCOMs should
   review the facts and circumstances of the case before concurring with the base that, in fact,
   the suggested fund citation is correct. Do this prior to recording the transaction in the
   accounting system.
   6.11.3. The DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 3, Chapter 10 states that all upward obligation adjustments
   against expired appropriation accounts (including P.L. 101-510 defined contract changes)
   that exceed $100,000 shall not be accomplished automatically (to include recording the
   transaction in the accounting system). The MAJCOMs or SAF/FMBMM must approve these
   adjustments before recording in the accounting system. Don’t place any upward adjustment
   greater than $2,000,000 ($100,000 for within scope contract changes and DoD appropriation
   adjustments) on the books without approval by SAF/FMBMM.
6.12. Reviewing Unliquidated Obligation (ULO) Balances in the Expired Years:
   6.12.1. MAJCOM and installations should periodically verify ULO balances, including
   reconciling ULO balances to supporting documents and reviewing documents to ensure each
   obligation meets valid criteria. (DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations
110                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


  requires accounting offices to deobligate proper and unliquidated obligations when standards
  for recording are no longer met.) Emphasizing the ULO validation process will help prevent
  any DoD audit follow-up findings, free funds for use on valid prior year upward adjustments,
  and enhance the credibility of Air Force accounting reports.
  6.12.2. MAJCOMs should establish procedures to assess obligations that are unduly
  outstanding or inactive, including making a tri-annual review of expired (especially fourth
  and fifth year) account balances. Letters validating this review are sent to AFAFO/FMFA,
  6760 E. Irvington Place, Aurora, CO 80279 no later than 25 February, 28 June, and 28
  September each year.
  6.12.3. To guarantee a thorough review, MAJCOMs will:
      6.12.3.1. Ensure that field activities follow guidance in DFAS-DE 7010.2-R (Paragraphs
      10.22 and 11.14.3) and DFAS-DE 7220.2-R (Paragraph 2.44) for validity review and
      update procedures.
      6.12.3.2. Ensure that your files document the follow-up effort and provide a clear audit
      trail supporting adjustments.
      6.12.3.3. Provide support to field activities regarding non-response to follow-up action.
      6.12.3.4. Meet promptly with contracting officers if follow-up action to procurement
      offices does not receive adequate or timely attention.
      6.12.3.5. Emphasize to field activities the need to elevate problems in a timely manner.
  6.12.4. Reviewing ULOs. (NOTE: normally, you should not have negative unliquidated
  obligations except when used as progress payments against contracts or as valid refund
  receivables.)
      6.12.4.1. Don’t close any account with a negative cash balance until you have made
      corrections or recorded an offsetting collection which will produce a positive cash
      balance. If during the negative ULO analysis you determine that the negative is a
      legitimate accounts receivable, establish a refund receivable and cancel the negative
      ULO. Take action to ensure the receivable is collected promptly. This refund receivable
      should remain on the books until you receive a collection. If the collection is received
      after the account is closed, deposit the funds to receipt account 3200, ―Collections of
      Receivables from Canceled Accounts.‖
      6.12.4.2. The Department of Defense must maintain records for any open items
      (obligations or receivables) for as long as they are outstanding, even if the account is
      closed. The fact that the account is closed does not mean that these items are no longer
      valid.
      6.12.4.3. Review old refund receivable accounts. Uncollected receivables will erode
      available fund balances required for upward adjustments. Follow collection actions in
      applicable accounting regulations.
      6.12.4.4. When you determine that a negative unliquidated obligation in the accounting
      system is invalid, report the release of individual or cumulative negative unliquidated
      obligations over $2,000,000 to SAF/FMBMM. Use the monthly report in paragraph
      6.16 to accomplish this task.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            111


       6.12.4.5. If the release of an invalid negative unliquidated obligation puts the
       appropriation in a negative balance, contact the MAJCOM immediately for resolution.
       The MAJCOM/FOA/DRU must contact SAF/FMBMM upon determining that sufficient
       funds are unavailable to correct the deficiency.
6.13. Charging Prior Year Obligated Due-Outs:
   6.13.1. Based on guidance from DFAS-Denver Center, charge obligated due-outs to a like
   year appropriation to comply with legislative requirements to maintain fiscal year identity.
   (NOTE: The Project Fund Management Record (PFMR) and Organization Cost Center
   Record (OCCR) records will identify actual year of obligation for current year plus five
   expired fiscal years, effective with a 1 April 1992 Standard Base Supply System (SBSS)
   release).
   6.13.2. At the end of the five expired years, the Treasury will cancel and withdraw fund
   balances. Charge obligated due-outs to a like year current appropriation; don’t exceed the one
   percent limitation. Consider these carry over obligations along with other canceled expenses
   against the one- percent limitation.
6.14. Reprogramming. (Most guidance in this paragraph applies to Air Staff activities.)
   6.14.1. Changes in contract scope. Apply this guidance for using currently available
   appropriations to fund changes in contract scope.
       6.14.1.1. Apply normal reprogramming (DD Form 1415-1, Reprogramming Action
       (Prior Approval Action) procedures and thresholds.
       6.14.1.2. Fund the change from (and identify it to) the current corresponding line item,
       program element or program applicable to the program for which the change is being
       made.
       6.14.1.3. If an applicable corresponding line item no longer exists in the currently
       available appropriation for the program for which the change is being made, create a new
       line item for the program in question to reflect the change adjustment. Apply the same
       reprogramming threshold procedures for the newly created line that you would use in
       creating any other new line item.
       6.14.1.4. Any line item or program can be the funding source for changes financed from
       currently available funds. However, you must apply normal reprogramming thresholds to
       the funding source line item or program.
   6.14.2. Within-scope contract changes and upward obligation adjustments for canceled
   accounts. Follow these procedures for using currently available appropriations to fund
   upward obligation adjustments and within-scope contract changes for contracts funded by
   appropriations that have been closed.
       6.14.2.1. Charge the appropriation currently available for the same purpose. Apply these
       specific limitations:
          6.14.2.1.1. The sum of all such amounts funded from currently available
          appropriations may not exceed the lower of (1) one percent of the originally
          appropriated amount of the current appropriation being charged or (2) the current
          unexpended balance of the closed account (exception is closed ―M‖ years).
 112                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


          6.14.2.1.2. The unexpended balance is the net of: (1) the sum of the unobligated
          balance plus the unliquidated obligated balance of the account at the time it was
          canceled, and, (2) less any and all obligations incurred and payments made
          subsequent to the cancellation of the original account when such obligations and
          payments would otherwise have been properly charged to the appropriation had the
          appropriation not been canceled.
       6.14.2.2. Don’t apply normal reprogramming (DD Form 1415-1, Reprogramming
       Action (Prior Approval Action) procedures and thresholds when using currently
       available appropriations to fund obligations or adjustments to obligations which would
       otherwise have been funded from a canceled account before it was canceled. Reflect the
       charges in a line item entitled ―Canceled Account Adjustments‖ on DD Form 1416,
       Report of Programs.
          6.14.2.2.1. Within an appropriation, you may exceed reprogramming thresholds in
          currently available appropriations for increases or sources used to finance the
          Canceled Account Adjustments line item.
          6.14.2.2.2. If you exceed reprogramming thresholds for increases or sources to
          finance these obligations or adjustments to obligations, footnote Column K, of the
          DD Form 1416, Report of Programs, to indicate that the threshold amount has been
          exceeded due to canceled account adjustments.
          6.14.2.2.3. Make the Canceled Account Adjustments line item a separate line item or
          program element and add it as an entry within a single budget activity.
          6.14.2.2.4. Congressional Special Interest restrictions annotated on the current year
          DD 1414, Appropriated Base for Reprogramming, apply.
   6.14.3. Within-scope contract changes and upward obligation adjustments using expired year
   funds. DoD Comptroller doesn’t require the Military Departments to submit reprogramming
   actions for expired accounts. Fund upward obligation adjustments and withinscope contract
   changes from the appropriation that initially financed the contract.
6.15. Complying With Control Levels in Expired Accounts:
   6.15.1. MAJCOM and appropriation managers don’t usually withdraw field-level funding
   (allocation, allotments, etc.) upon expiration of an appropriation (see Chapter 3) because
   expired appropriations continue to be available for obligation adjustments. Continue to
   comply with fund authorization guidance until the funds issuer revises the authorization or
   the appropriation is canceled. NOTE: These fund authorizations are not available for new
   obligations. You must apply obligations incurred, but not recorded until after the
   appropriation expired, against the availability in the administrative subdivision in effect at
   the time the obligations were actually incurred.
   6.15.2. Level of Detail in the Expired Years. For accounting purposes, the level of detail
   in the accounting systems must remain the same in the expired years as is required for current
   year accounts. Appropriation managers may issue budget authority for expired appropriations
   at the allotment level. All congressional and legal restrictions continue during the expired
   period. Recipients shall adjust line item detail (budget allotment) to agree with the revised
   allotment total. Military Construction and Military Family Housing Construction
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               113


   appropriations must maintain detail at the project level into the expired years. BRAC 88 must
   maintain detail at the budget project level.
6.16. Collections. Public Law 101-510 requires that any collections received after the
appropriation cancels be deposited to Miscellaneous Receipts Account of the Treasury. Accounts
receivables are amounts due from others for goods furnished and services rendered. Refunds are
requested returns of advances or recoveries of erroneous disbursements that are directly related
to and reductions of previously recorded payments from the accounts.
   6.16.1. If the collections are received that are applicable to a canceled account, the collection
   must be deposited to receipt account 57 3200, Collection of Receivables from Canceled
   Accounts (Limit .0001 for Refunds and .0002 for Reimbursements).
   6.16.2. When writing off a refund receivable with type code 8 or 9 that is posted as a reverse
   undelivered order outstanding (UOO) or accrued expenditure unpaid (AEU) against an
   appropriation that is canceled, current year funds must be used to cover the write off.
   6.16.3. When a by-others collection is made on or prior to 30 September for a receivable
   recorded in a closing account, but not accepted by the accountable station until after year-end
   closeout or later, the accountable station will record the by-others in the appropriation
   canceled account.
   6.16.4. The status of both the direct and reimbursable program obligated and unobligated
   balances, even in an account that has canceled, must be continuously maintained. If
   obligations and/or expenditures are incurred against a reimbursable order, and if that
   reimbursable order is later found to be uncollectable, then a potential violation of the
   Antideficiency Act may occur to the extent that appropriated (direct program) resources
   existing in the canceled account are not sufficient to absorb these obligations and /or
   expenditures. The unobligated balance of the direct program of the canceled account is
   determined by subtracting all the adjustments made to the canceled account that were
   charged to a current appropriation both as to purpose and in amount.
   6.16.5. Both reimbursement authority and reimbursable obligations should be adjusted to
   accommodate valid upward obligation adjustments whenever possible. Prior to increasing the
   accounts receivable transaction, the performing activity must have written evidence from the
   requesting activity that the requesting activity has performed an upward obligation
   adjustment, AND understands that a billing action will take place in settlement of the upward
   obligation payment. Without this written consent and acknowledgement, the performing
   activity will have to settle the upward obligation adjustment with direct authority. The Air
   Staff strongly recommends that future, initial agreements between the performing activity
   and the requesting activity contain disclaimer clauses (in the MIPR, Project Order, MOA,
   etc.) that spell out the requesting activity’s responsibilities in the event of expired/canceled
   upward obligation adjustments.
6.17. Monthly and Fiscal Year-end Reporting Requirements for Transactions under
$100,000.
   6.17.1. Monthly Reporting Requirements. Monthly reporting requirements                       are
   accomplished through the OARS for tracking limitations required by P.L. 101-510:
114                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


      6.17.1.1. Program name, amount of the adjustment financed ($ in thousands), PE and
      Activity Group for 3400 adjustments, and cumulative totals.
      6.17.1.2. Reason for adjustment (see paragraph 6.3 of this guidance for reportable
      within scope contract changes).
      6.17.1.3. Accounting classification (line item detail for all appropriations except O&M.
      For O&M, appropriation and fiscal year only).
      6.17.1.4. Funding Source.
  6.17.2. Fiscal Yearend Reporting Requirements:
      6.17.2.1. Fiscal year-end reporting requirements are accomplished through OARS for
      tracking limitations required by P.L. 101-510.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                          115


                                             Chapter 7

                                   SUPPORT GUIDANCE

Section 7A—Overview

7.1. Applying This Chapter. Follow this financial management guidance to plan and execute
support transactions between component organizations of the Air Force and:
   7.1.1. Other Air Force activities (intraservice support - includes Air Force, Air Force
   Reserve, and Air National Guard)).
   7.1.2. Component organizations of other Department of Defense (DoD) departments and
   agencies (interservice support).
   7.1.3. Component organizations of non-DoD departments and agencies (interagency
   support).
7.2. Complying with Statutory Authority. Air Force organizations that obtain materials,
work, or services from other DoD components and other government agencies (or provide the
same to non-Air Force activities) must do so under statutory authority. Usually, one or more of
the following applies:
   7.2.1. Project Orders (41 U. S. C. 23).
   7.2.2. Economy Act Orders (31 U. S. C. 1535).
   7.2.3. Orders for Procurement by Another DoD Component (10 U. S. C. 2308, 2309).
   7.2.4. Orders from Stock for Supplies, Materiel, or Equipment of another DoD Component.
   7.2.5. Orders Required by Law to be Placed with a Government Agency, e.g.:
       7.2.5.1. Federal Prison Industries (18 U.S.C. 4124).
       7.2.5.2. Government Printing Office (44 U.S.C. 501).
       7.2.5.3. Corps of Engineers (33 U.S.C. 576, 701b-10).
       7.2.5.4. General Services Administration (Federal Supply Schedule).
7.3. Responsibilities:
   7.3.1. MAJCOMs and bases should issue instructions to ensure that:
       7.3.1.1. The originator or manager coordinates the support agreement with the office of
       the Director, Financial Management/Comptroller (FM).
       7.3.1.2. The FM activity maintains a file of agreements.
       7.3.1.3. The Comptroller, or designated representative, signs all agreements (see DoD
       Instruction 4000.19 and AFI 25-201).
   7.3.2. Installation Financial Management Comptroller must perform the financial analysis
   functions detailed in AFI 25-201 paragraph 2.6.
   7.3.3. Installation Financial Management Comptroller must annually perform a budget
   review of support agreement reimbursements. More extensive guidance was provided in
 116                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   SAF/FM January 5, 2004 memorandum w/attachment, Annual Budget Review for Support
   Agreements, mailed to all FM Offices.
       7.3.3.1. Compare total dollars collected via reimbursement from customer to the total
       estimated reimbursement for that customer. Keep in mind one customer may have been
       serviced through several agreements and that some agreements may be financed via
       direct cite instead of reimbursement.
       7.3.3.2. If the total amount collected for the customer is within +/- 5% of what the
       reimbursement estimate was and that dollar amount is within +/- $100,000, no further
       action is required.
       7.3.3.3. If the variance stated in paragraph 7.3.3.2 is exceeded, compare collections by
       EEIC and RC/CC to the services specified in the agreement(s). Determine reasons for the
       amount over 5% and propose changes to the agreement(s) as needed. For example,
       mission changes or estimating errors may have caused an overestimate or underestimate
       of requirements. This would require adjusting the budget annex. In some cases, no
       change may be necessary. For example, the support estimated, while a potential
       requirement, may not have been used or needed during this specific time period.
       Document the reconciliation and adjust the annex via pen and ink changes. Notify the
       base Support Agreement Monitor (SAM) and customer of any changes needed to the
       annex. Depending on the number and degree of changes, a new agreement may need to
       be accomplished. If the changes are minor, a revised, coordinated budget annex is all that
       is required.
       7.3.3.4. There is no prescribed time period in which to perform the annual review. The
       optimum time period would be close to the timing of financial plans. This gives the
       customer ample time to adjust the dollars needed for next year’s support if large errors
       were found.

Section 7B—Intraservice Relationships (Within the Air Force)

7.4. General HostTenant Responsibilities:
   7.4.1. When a tenant command asks, the host command:
       7.4.1.1. Provides administrative and logistical support to the tenant under AFI 25-201
       and this section. The tenant requirements must be consistent with the unit precedence in
       the USAF Program, Bases, Units, and Priorities Documents (PD).
       7.4.1.2. Administers funds made available by the tenant’s parent command to support the
       tenant.
   7.4.2. The tenant command:
       7.4.2.1. Advises the host command of tenant requirements early enough to permit
       consideration when the host formulates its budget and financial plan and revisions.
       7.4.2.2. When the host command asks, furnishes program guidance and factors so the
       host can include tenant support requirements in host budget estimates and financial plans.
       The tenant provides similar guidance when the host base budget office provides budget
       support to the tenant under AFI 25-201.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              117


      7.4.2.3. Will not change planning factors such as utilization rates and overall scope of
      activity (once tenant support requirements are agreed upon) without notifying the host
      command in advance.
   7.4.3. The parties jointly:
      7.4.3.1. Revise AFI 25-201 agreements depending on the size of the tenant’s requested
      changes and their effect on the host’s support capability.
      7.4.3.2. Follow procedures in AFI 25-201 when support agreements are required and
      commands can’t agree.
      7.4.3.3. Follow Figure 7.1 in assigning intraservice host and tenant funding
      responsibilities. It identifies services or materiel that tenants usually need from operation
      and maintenance-type (O&M) and research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E)
      appropriations. The figure shows the command that has budgeting and funding
      responsibility, and in part summarizes Section 7B.
   7.4.4. Apply Figure 7.1 to all tenants, except as noted in paragraph 7.8 (whether the tenant
   is on host base property or offbase). Figure 7.1 notes exceptions for offbase tenants.
   7.4.5. If the support services aren’t covered in Figure 7.1 or Section 7B:
      7.4.5.1. Prepare and negotiate a host-tenant agreement, following AFI 25-201, which
      identifies responsibilities for services that aren’t covered.
      7.4.5.2. Forward such agreements through prescribed command channels for approval.
   7.4.6. You may need more guidance on host-tenant relationships and specific budgeting and
   funding responsibilities involving Air Force Reserve (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG),
   and Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) organizations. If so, see: AFRC, Chapter 15;
   ANG, Chapter 16; DWCF, and Chapter 18; DoDI 4000.19, Interservice and
   Intragovernmental Support.

3. When the host can provide one of these services only through a contract, the off-base tenant
   command funds the service.
4. If service is provided by contract, the tenant command has funding responsibility. However, if
   the host command contracts out the service after providing it in-house, the tenant command
   will assume funding responsibility budget leadtime away.
7.5. Tenant Command Funding Responsibilities. The tenant command budgets, funds, and
provides for the following tenant requirements:
   7.5.1. Civilian personnel costs.
   7.5.2. Travel costs for assigned military and civilian personnel.
   7.5.3. Purchase of expense materiel, supplies, and equipment from DWCF Supply
   Management (previously stock fund) divisions and local procurement sources (non-DWCF).
        7.5.3.1. This includes ground fuels such as gas, oil, and other lubricants issued to or
        procured by the tenant for vehicles and other ground powered equipment which are the
        property of or are per
        7.5.3.2. It also includes gratuitous replacement of uniform clothing lost, damaged,
        destroyed, or otherwise rendered unserviceable through no fault or neglect of the owner.
        7.5.3.3. EXCEPTIONS: (Applies to tenant units on the host’s installation): Dormitory
        furnishings and furniture specified in TA 414; janitorial, cleaning, and personal hygiene
        items (such as cleaners, waxes, toilet tissue, mops, brooms) needed to maintain the living
        quarters at the host command’s standard for permanent occupancy (tenant unit may
        provide their own cleaning supplies for their dorms); and expense materiel provided to
        the ―host base support tenants.‖ But, if the tenant unit is geographically separated and

      must maintain its own dormitories (including custodial services, budgeting, and funding),
      the tenant’s parent command must provide dormitory furnishings and furniture.
  7.5.4. Contractual services, except communication services, utilities, training, contract
  custodial services for on-base facilities, and other on-base, civil engineering services done
  under contract such as trash hauling, snow removal, and contracts required to provide
  common services (item 9, Figure 7.1). (Figure 7.1 lists the tenant command’s
  responsibilities for custodial services of operational facilities, contractor facilities, and off-
  base units.)
  7.5.5. Maintenance:
      7.5.5.1. Usually, the host must pay for intermediate, in-house maintenance of host and
      tenant aircraft, missiles, and all other equipment, unless the host base doesn’t have the
      personnel specialists, equipment, and facilities to do intermediate maintenance; or unless
      the tenant is organized to perform the maintenance as specified in AFI 25-201 and AFI
      21-101, in which case the tenant has the budget and funding responsibilities.
      EXCEPTIONS:.
         7.5.5.1.1. Vehicle maintenance, for which you determine funding responsibility
         based on possession and ownership of the vehicles.
         7.5.5.1.2. Maintenance of unique equipment (see paragraph 7.5.5.3 and 4 below).
      7.5.5.2. When a host base can’t do all in-house maintenance without letting contracts,
      show in the agreement how to determine costs for the host and tenant.
      7.5.5.3. When the host base can’t maintain equipment that needs maintenance and uses
      contracts for all intermediate level maintenance on these items, the tenant must fund
      contract maintenance on all of its equipment (full time use or permanent dispatch), as
      documented on accountable records of the host EMO and vehicle authorization lists. This
      includes all mission support equipment, common support equipment, other ground
      equipment, communications equipment, vehicles, and any other equipment that is the
      tenant’s property, except the tenant’s office machines and equipment, dormitory furniture
      and furnishings (TA 414), and real property installed equipment (RPIE).
      7.5.5.4. The tenant must fund all expense materiel, parts, tires, batteries, antifreeze,
      subassemblies, and civilian labor costs required to maintain vehicles that are the property
      of or are permanently dispatched to the tenant. The tenant pays for vehicle maintenance
      services through reimbursement or refunds using the online, interactive, vehicle
      management system (OLVIMS).
      7.5.5.5. The tenant must pay for expense materiel (exceeding $250 per intermediate
      work order) required to repair equipment peculiar to the tenant’s mission (excluding
      aircraft and missiles), if the host base would need special capability to repair it. An
      example is equipment unique to the tenant repaired in the host base’s precision
      measurement equipment laboratory (PMEL) and requiring special parts or expense
      materiel. The tenant funds for unique PMEL support. Determine special support
      requirements for repairing and calibrating the tenant’s unique equipment during AFI 25-
      201 negotiations.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            123


      7.5.5.6. This includes expense materiel for maintaining assigned aircraft, missiles, and
      equipment, except for intermediate level maintenance the host does when the tenant isn’t
      organized to do it, and for maintaining RPIE.
      7.5.5.7. The tenant is responsible for funding those repair projects which are unique to
      the operation of the tenant such as rearrangement of interior partitions to improve
      operations or force protection, i.e. perimeter fencing, barriers, etc. specifically for the
      tenants building necessitated by the nature of the tenant’s operation.
   7.5.6. Tenant units budget and fund for their cargo movements in connection with PCS and
   TDY when payment is chargeable to organizational O&M funds.
7.6. Host Command Funding Responsibilities. The host command budgets, funds, and
provides for these tenant requirements:
   7.6.1. Allowances of dormitory furnishings and furniture specified in TA 414 and janitorial,
   cleaning, and personal hygiene items necessary to maintain the living quarters (onbase
   tenants only).
   7.6.2. Locally procured investment equipment (including rental) the tenant requires to fulfill
   its approved equipment authorization.
      7.6.2.1. Base procured investment equipment (BPIE) items. The host command buys
      these investment items locally using BP*84XXXX, 57*3080 appropriation funds.
      Renting investment items instead of buying them. The host base uses its O&M funds.
      EXCEPTION: Use RDT&E funds to rent investment equipment for an O&M-funded
      tenant on an RDT&E-funded host base. Also, an RDT&E tenant funds procurement or
      rental of investment equipment for RDT&E tenants on an O&M-type host base.
   7.6.3. Intermediate-level maintenance for the tenant if the tenant is not organized to do it.
   This maintenance includes calibrating, repairing, or replacing damaged or unserviceable
   parts, components, or assemblies except as outlined in paragraph 7.5.5 (Doesn’t apply to
   Air Logistics Centers-AFMC).
   7.6.4. Expense materiel the host uses to maintain buildings and grounds the tenant occupies
   and to provide base support common to all people and organizations, to the extent that the
   tenant is not self-supporting. Examples are dependents’ education, fire protection, ground
   safety, information service, laundry and dry-cleaning, legal services, officers quarters, and
   enlisted dorms.
   7.6.5. Procuring expense RPIE.
   7.6.6. Data processing equipment, including control panels in the tenant activity, used
   mainly for common management support.
   7.6.7. Operating and maintaining a leased or rented building off base, including any part a
   tenant occupies, with no charge to the tenant for their partial occupancy.
   7.6.8. Expense materiel issued on a nonreimbursable basis to tenants satellited on or near a
   base as indicated in paragraph 7.8.1.1 below.
   7.6.9. Contract maintenance for all office machines and equipment, dormitory furnishings,
   and furniture.
 124                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   7.6.10. Architectural and engineering (A&E) design services. These are ―common support‖
   functions. The host is responsible for budgeting and funding support functions common to all
   tenant organizations to the extent the tenant is not self-supporting. EXCEPTIONS:
       7.6.10.1. Contract services for off-base tenant units when the host can’t do it in-house.
       7.6.10.2. Design of minor construction projects for allied support included in the Air
       Force’s standard communications-computer programs. The implementing command will
       finance the cost of an A&E design contract. The host’s in-house design costs for A&E
       aren’t reimbursable.
7.7. Handling Unfunded Requirements. The tenant must tell the host its requirements early
enough to allow consideration during budget formulation. When the host isn’t informed budget
leadtime away, the tenant may not ―demand‖ funding from the host. If funds aren’t available, the
host submits an unfunded requirement to its next higher headquarters for funding consideration.
As a last resort, the tenant command may fund the specific unfunded tenant requirement. Follow
billing and collection procedures in chapter 29, DFAS-DE 7010.2- R.
7.8. Exceptions to General HostTenant Responsibilities:
   7.8.1. Host Base Support Tenants:
       7.8.1.1. If an Air Force tenant is satellited on or near the host mainly to support the host
       command’s units, the host base budgets, funds, and provides for tenant requirements
       except for civilian pay, military and civilian suggestion cash awards, and temporary duty
       travel (TDY). For the following tenants, don’t apply Figure 7.1; they fall under this
       funding exception:
           7.8.1.1.1. Air Force Special Security Officer System.
           7.8.1.1.2. Mobile Training Detachments and Field Training Detachments.
           7.8.1.1.3. Office of Special Investigations (OSI) District Offices and Detachments.
           (See paragraph 7.8.1.3).
           7.8.1.1.4. Air Force Audit Agency resident, representative, liaison, and regional
           offices.
           7.8.1.1.5. Air Force Reserve Medical Service Units (MSU), if co-located and
           assigned to active duty medical facilities for training. (Applies to personnel in a non-
           TDY status only).
           7.8.1.1.6. Air Force Judicial Circuit Offices.
           7.8.1.1.7. HQ Civil Air Patrol (CAP) USAF and CAP Liaison Offices.
       7.8.1.2. Don’t apply the above exception to the headquarters or subunits of the tenant
       (except those located solely for the support of the host command). They must fund for
       their requirements according to paragraph 7.5 above, even though they receive logistic
       support from the same host base.
       7.8.1.3. HQ AFOSI budgets and funds for:
           7.8.1.3.1. Emergency roadside repairs and off-base purchases of gasoline and oil for
           government-owned vehicles assigned to the OSI; and
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                          125


        7.8.1.3.2. Camouflage fatigues and mobility bags when the requirement is not
        specified in mobility taskings (for example, unified and specified OPLANs).
     7.8.1.4. Because some of the tenants listed above offer diverse services to the host base,
     you may need to sort out what the host base pays for. For example, if the host base
     supports a tenant of another command and the tenant command needs a special weather
     or communication unit, then the tenant’s parent command must negotiate with the
     command that provides the special support.
  7.8.2. Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF):
     7.8.2.1. Support agreements with DWCF activities must comply with DoDI 4000.19 and
     AFI 25-201. Charge DWCF activities for incremental direct costs that are measurable and
     directly attributable to the receiver. The following program element codes define base
     support resources provided to DWCF activities:
        7.8.2.1.1. XXX56 - environmental compliance.
        7.8.2.1.2. XXX76 - restoration and modernization projects <$750,000.
        7.8.2.1.3. XXX78 - sustainment.
        7.8.2.1.4. XXX79 - real property services.
        7.8.2.1.5. XXX90 - audio-visual information services.
        7.8.2.1.6. XXX95 - base communications.
        7.8.2.1.7. XXX96 - base operations.
     7.8.2.2. As of 1 October 93, active DWCF business areas on Air Force installations
     include:
        7.8.2.2.1. Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS).
        7.8.2.2.2. Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).
        7.8.2.2.3. Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).

        7.8.2.2.8. Supply Management Activity Group (SMAG).
  7.8.3. Air Education and Training Command (AETC) Leased Government Quarters
  for Recruiting Services Personnel. (NOTE: Effective FY 1983, no new domestic leases
  have been authorized.)
  7.8.4. TDY of Aircrew Members. The mission-support manager funds TDYs for aircrew
  members assigned or attached for AFI 36-2212 training, when they are working as
  crewmembers, regardless of the organization to which they’re assigned for primary duty.
  7.8.5. Funding for Rotational Units and Deployments:
126                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


      7.8.5.1. Because members of rotational units and deployments are TDY and the host
      operationally controls assigned aircraft, these units aren’t bona fide tenants. Don’t apply
      normal host or tenant procedures. Usually, each Air Force activity budgets and funds for
      civilian pay and TDY expenses of its personnel. Therefore, unless civilian spaces and
      personnel authorizations of these tenant units are transferred to the host activity, the
      activity to which members are assigned will fund civilian pay and TDY. The command to
      which these transient units are deployed funds all other costs.
      7.8.5.2. You should also apply funding guidance for rotational units, deployments, and
      JCS exercises to ANG and AFRC units assigned duties to support the active forces, other
      than for training. The command hosting the rotation, deployment, or JCS exercise will
      fund all costs, except civilian pay and TDY.
  7.8.6. Refueling Transient Air Force Vehicles. The Air Force installation providing the
  refueling support will fund the refueling of transient vehicles owned or operated by the Air
  Force. Don’t apply this guidance to ANG, AFRC, or non-Air Force vehicles. These activities
  will continue to fund their refueling requirements.
  7.8.7. TDY Deployments That Involve Transferring Units’ (Aircraft And Personnel)
  Operational Control. Apply these budgeting and funding responsibilities:
      7.8.7.1. The command to which personnel are assigned funds TDY and civilian pay.
      7.8.7.2. The command with operational control of the aircraft finances all other costs
      (including base and intermediate maintenance, and contract quarters).
  7.8.8. Air Force Special Operations Command. The Memorandum of Agreement
  between the Air Force and the United States Special Operations Command, as changed by
  later agreements, governs USAF support of Air Force Special Operations Forces.
  7.8.9. Government Support Provided Contractors:
      7.8.9.1. Apply the guidance in paragraphs 7.5 and 7.6 when the host command
      furnishes an on-base contractor logistical support under a tenant-funded contract. The
      command that must accomplish the contract will reimburse or refund the host base using
      the same funds cited in the basic contract. Don’t allow the funding command to make the
      reimbursement through the contractor.
      7.8.9.2. Finance the cost of repairing, modifying, or constructing buildings used by a
      contractor on government-owned or leased land from the appropriations available for
      such purposes. Charge the command that must accomplish the contract. (That is, from
      O&M, RDT&E, or military construction.) EXCEPTION: don’t apply this guidance to
      contract field teams doing on-site maintenance under AFMC maintenance (DWCF), or
      O&M-funded contracts. The local base supply officer provides materiel support to these
      activities as prescribed by AFJMAN 23-210.
  7.8.10. Payment for Official Mail. Each installation and geographically separated unit
  (GSU) must budget and fund for their own official mail requirements. Apply the following
  guidance:
      7.8.10.1. Charge all Air Force and non-Air Force tenants for all postage costs.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               127


       7.8.10.2. A Host has the option to set a limit below which it is not cost effective to
       recoup postage reimbursement.
7.9. Disposing of Turnin Credits:
   7.9.1. When one or more tenants deactivate or depart and have accrued stock fund credits,
   any remaining tenant units funded by the same parent command will use the stock fund
   credits. If none of these units remain, the DWCF reimburses the parent command of the
   deactivated or departed tenant. Reimburse at the earliest possible date after deactivation or
   departure , but not latter than 30 September of the fiscal year in which the credit was earned.
   7.9.2. Follow criteria in stock fund (DWCF) guidance to credit turn-ins of expense materiel.
7.10. Billing Tenants:
   7.10.1. Consider two or more tenants funded by the same parent command under a single
   fund allotment as a single tenant. Bill these tenants so you separately classify them and
   identify charges by cost center.
   7.10.2. You may waive billings when the accumulated charges against a reimbursable tenant
   don’t exceed $125 for any calendar quarter. EXCEPTION: Don’t apply this waiver to
   DWCF transactions or support.
   7.10.3. See DFAS-DE 7010.2–R, Chapter 29, for billing procedures on support rendered to a
   tenant, and DFAS-DER 7410.1-R, Chapter 10, for stock fund materiel billing procedures.
   7.10.4. Thrift Shops operated by Wives/Spouses clubs on Air Force installations are exempt
   from reimbursing for utilities (SECAF 9 Apr 96 Policy Memorandum).
7.11. Making Jurisdictional Transfers. Gaining and losing commands should draft a transfer
agreement to transfer an installation or other activity between jurisdictions. The gaining
command should forward the agreement to HQ USAF for approval:
   7.11.1. Concurrent with submitting the agreement to HQ USAF, gaining and losing
   commands must forward revisions to their annual financial plans for the appropriations and
   funds affected by the transfer. Your justification should cover only the changes in mission
   because of the transfer. SAF/FMB will adjust the command budget authorizations and fund
   allocations as necessary.
   7.11.2. The commands must try to transfer all funds and funding responsibilities as of one
   date, preferably on the first day of the month or fiscal quarter. The date of transfer of funding
   responsibility should coincide with the date of transfer of civilian personnel authorizations.
   See also DFAS-DE 7010.1-R, Part 4, for transfer of funding responsibilities.
7.12. Reimbursing Landing Fees and Base Maintenance for Transient Aircraft. See AFI
10-1001 and specific agreements for current guidance and rates for charging transient aircraft
landing fees. Bill for base level maintenance on transient aircraft (including fleet service) as
follows:
   7.12.1. No reimbursement.
       7.12.1.1. ANG aircraft.
       7.12.1.2. AFRC aircraft.
 128                                                 AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       7.12.1.3. Other Air Force aircraft
   7.12.2. Reimbursement is not required because the above policies are reciprocal. In other
   words, Air Force installations won’t bill ANG, AFRC, or TWCF aircraft for transient
   maintenance on their aircraft nor will those organizations bill the Air Force for transient
   maintenance on Air Force aircraft.
   7.12.3. Non-Air Force Aircraft. Reimbursement is required. Accumulate individual
   transactions of less than $125 for another DoD activity within a fiscal quarter. If they amount
   to less than $125 during the quarter, the provider may waive reimbursement. The Air Force
   does not require reimbursement for routine parking and launching (Follow Me) service from
   transient aircraft owned and operated by the U.S. Government or from U.S. Air Force
   contract aircraft.
   7.12.4. Landing Fees. The FY 2001 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) (P.L.
   106-398), Sec. 387 reauthorized the pilot program for acceptance and use of landing fees
   charged for use of military airfields by civil aircraft in the United States or in a territory or
   possession of the United States. This authority extends through 30 September 2010.
   Amounts received in payment of landing fees for use of a military airfield in a fiscal year of
   the pilot program shall be credited to the appropriation that is available for that fiscal year for
   the operation and maintenance of the military airfield, shall be merged with amounts in the
   appropriation to which credited, and shall be available for that military airfield for the same
   period and purpose as the appropriation is available. Funds are credited to the fiscal year in
   which the collection is made. Without additional legislation, no landing fees may be
   credited to an appropriation after 30 September 2010.
   7.12.5. Johnston Atoll (Reimbursement for Support Provided to Civil Air
   Carriers). The FY2001 NDAA (P.L. 106-398), Sec 383, which adds Sec. 9783 to Title 10,
   authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to
   require payment by a civil aircraft carrier for support provided by the United States to the
   carrier at Johnston Atoll that is either requested by the civil air carrier or determined under
   the regulations as being necessary to accommodate the civil air carrier’s use of Johnston
   Atoll. Amounts collected from an air carrier shall be credited to appropriations available for
   the fiscal year in which collected as follows: (1) for support provided by the Air Force, to
   appropriations available for the Air Force for operation and maintenance and (2) for support
   provided by the Army, to appropriations available for the Army chemical demiltarization.
   Refer to the text of 10 U.S.C. 9783 for greater detail.
7.13. Supporting Commissaries. The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) includes each
Military Department’s commissary system. As a DWCF activity, DeCA activities on or
supported by Air Force installations will reimburse host bases for support costs under negotiated
interservice support agreements, using the support categories and guidance in DoDI 4000.19
(Interservice and Intragovernmental Support, April 15, 1992). Reimbursement includes direct,
indirect, and general and administrative (G&A) support costs, but excludes depreciation of a host
base’s capital equipment and facilities and the cost of its military personnel. DoD 5105.55-R,
Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), provides guidance on operating DeCA.
7.14. Investigating Aircraft Accidents,            Including      UAVs,      and    Environmental
Cleanup. Provide funding support as follows:
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               129


   7.14.1. The host installation supporting the investigation funds for any in-house support.
   7.14.2. The commands to which board members and witnesses are assigned pay for their
   TDY travel.
   7.14.3. The investigating command funds other support costs (for example, leasing of
   vehicles or special equipment, leased communications, and other contractual services).
   7.14.4. The Major command or Air Reserve Component that possesses an aircraft at the time
   of the mishap funds the environmental cleanup of the mishap site.

Section 7C—Interservice Relationships

7.15. Overview. This section prescribes uniform guidance for interservice support (Air Force
and other DoD components), consistent with DoDI 4000.19, Interservice and Intragovernmental
Support.
7.16. CrossServicing:
   7.16.1. For budgeting and funding, cross-servicing divides into category one (reimbursable)
   and category two (direct cite).
   7.16.2. Under category one (reimbursable), Air Force activities acting as the:
       7.16.2.1. Ordering agency must budget and fund for the cost of the items or services
       ordered.
       7.16.2.2. Procuring or performing agency must budget on a reimbursable basis. Fund the
       materiel or services for the ordering agency the same as for similar products or services
       for your own account.
   7.16.3. Under category two (direct cite):
       7.16.3.1. The contractor bills each ordering agency separately for articles delivered or
       services rendered, based on the ordering agency’s instructions. But, when articles are
       delivered for storage to the procuring agency for the ordering agency’s account, the
       agencies must make cross-disbursing arrangements so the procuring agency can pay
       vendor’s invoices against funds cited by the ordering agency.
       7.16.3.2. Unless the departments otherwise agree, don’t accept or issue Military
       Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPRs) citing expiring appropriations (must be
       obligated by 30 September of that fiscal year) after 31 May.
       7.16.3.3. If you need to submit MIPRs citing expiring appropriations after the cutoff
       date, first contact the procuring department to find out if it can execute a contract or
       otherwise obligate the funds by fiscal year-end. Procuring departments must attempt to
       obligate funds for all such MIPRs accepted after the cutoff date, but accepting a late
       MIPR doesn’t mean they will obligate all such funds.
       7.16.3.4. These instructions don’t restrict processing MIPRs as long as the procuring
       department can execute contracts or otherwise obligate the funds before the end of the
       fiscal year.
   7.16.4. Only orders you place under the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535) are subject to
   deobligation as prescribed in the statute and implemented by DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on
 130                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   Accounting for Obligations. 31 U.S.C. 1535(d) states, “An order placed or agreement
   made under this section [the Economy Act] obligates an appropriation of the ordering
   agency or unit. The amount obligated is deobligated to the extent that the agency or
   unit filling the order has not incurred obligations, before the end of the period of
   availability of the appropriation, in (1) providing goods or services; or making an
   authorized contract with another person to provide the requested goods or service.”
   Retain all other orders on the accounting records until liquidated, adjusted, or deobligated
   according to normal procedures.
7.17. Determining Cross-Servicing Charges. Base charges for cross-servicing on the
guidance in this paragraph. Depending on your agreement, you may need to apply more than one
type of cross-servicing in one agreement.
   7.17.1. Refer to DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 11A and DFAS-DE 7010.2-R to determine
   reimbursable costs and amounts to collect for interservice support, unless another directive or
   instruction authorizes different reimbursements. Examples would be instructions governing
   major range and test facility bases, revolving fund (DWCF) operations, and foreign military
   sales.
   7.17.2. Compute charges for cross-servicing by activities operating an industrial fund cost
   accounting system according to Defense Working Capital Fund guidance and the business
   area’s approved charter. DoD guidance on common service warehousing (that is,
   nonreimbursable) doesn’t apply to industrial funds if they incur costs for services they
   provide.
   7.17.3. Air Force activities operating an industrial-type cost accounting system will include
   direct labor, direct materiel, and overhead, but not military pay and allowances, in cross-
   servicing charges.
   7.17.4. The furnishing department bills these items at cost: electricity, gas, steam, water, or
   other similar utilities furnished as a separate cross-service. They can’t be incidental to
   another cross-service and can’t be computed under 7.17.1 through 7.17.4 above.
   7.17.5. Air Force activities may not levy surcharges or other charges not authorized in this
   chapter.
7.18. Accepting Cross-Service Orders:
   7.18.1. The procuring agency will send a written acceptance or rejection with explanation,
   not later than 30 days after receiving a cross-service order. (The base activity that contracts
   or provides the ordered service or materiel, not Accounting and Finance, accepts MIPRs.)
       7.18.1.1. EXCEPTION: you don’t need to accept in writing on orders for common use
       standard stock, if you can deliver the order (as requested by the ordering agency) within
       30 days.
       7.18.1.2. You must accept in writing in the case of delayed delivery of common use
       standard stock (usually within 60 days from date of agreement with the performing
       agency for the delayed delivery). In unusual, infrequent cases, if the accepting agency
       isn’t able to deliver within 60 days, it may agree with the ordering activity to delay
       delivery, but in no event beyond 120 days.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              131


      7.18.1.3. If the procuring agency needs more than 30 days to coordinate the order, it
      should advise the ordering agency in writing of the anticipated acceptance date, within 30
      days of receiving the order. Don’t change the financing method shown in the acceptance.
      You don’t usually use ―Notifications of Rejection‖ for coordinated procurement when the
      procuring agency buys for the other services.
   7.18.2. Include in an acceptance at least:
      7.18.2.1. Identification of cross-service order (number and date, ordering agency, and
      address).
      7.18.2.2. Statement accepting the order. For accepting MIPRs, the statement must say:
      ―The terms of this MIPR are satisfactory and are accepted, subject to the corrections for
      consolidated reimbursable procurement stated herein. The items requested will be
      furnished as follows:‖.
      7.18.2.3. Statement of financing method you will use in filling the order:
          7.18.2.3.1. By reimbursement upon delivery (Category One).
          7.18.2.3.2. By direct citation of ordering agency funds (Category Two).
          7.18.2.3.3. List of line items under each category above, and total estimated price by
          line item, except that you may consolidate item numbers on the order which are
          subject to the same procurement method and budget account classification and accept
          them as a single-line entry.
      7.18.2.4. Date of acceptance.
      7.18.2.5. Signature, title, and address of officer or individual authorized to accept the
      order.
      7.18.2.6. If the procuring agency expects price revisions or variations in quantity
      contingencies under consolidated reimbursable procurement, the procuring agency
      representative who accepts the MIPR must note them in the acceptance statement.
      7.18.2.7. You may show the acceptance format on the cross-service order as a snap-out
      sheet or as a separate form. Include a heading in capital letters that reads:
      ―ACCEPTANCE OF CROSS-SERVICE ORDER.‖ Provide enough space to include the
      required information.
   7.18.3. Treat amendments to an accepted order the same way as an initial order. Before
   accepting an amendment, find out whether or not the acceptance results in a loss to the Air
   Force. If a loss would result, the provider must evaluate the loss and qualify the acceptance to
   ensure enough funds will be available to reimburse the Air Force for the loss. The provider
   should waive losses under $100 resulting from complete cancellation of the order.
7.19. Financing Cross-Service Orders:
   7.19.1. Finance cross-servicing by the following methods only:
      7.19.1.1. Category One. By reimbursing upon delivery or performance or upon settling
      progress billings for orders placed with industrial funds.
132                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


      7.19.1.2. Category Two. By citing ordering agency funds. In this case, the contractor or
      supplier will bill and be paid by the requiring activity directly, or the performing activity
      will cite the funds of the requiring activity.
  7.19.2. If either category is appropriate, the procuring agency will decide how to finance
  cross-servicing.
  7.19.3. Cite the requiring department’s funds when the Air Force acts as procuring agency
  for another department and the items being procured are unique to the other department (the
  Air Force has no known requirements for like items). When acting as the procuring agency
  for another department, the Air Force may determine the type of funding (direct citation or
  reimbursable) to use. Finance all items subject to consolidated procurement, in accepted
  cross-service orders, on a reimbursable basis. Use the reimbursement method of financing
  when an order is received for items that are Air Force procured, Air Force used, or which are
  normally carried in Air Force stock. Don’t use separate contracts or separate delivery
  schedules to avoid sustaining reimbursable costs for another DoD agency.
  7.19.4. For consolidated-reimbursable procurement, Category One:
      7.19.4.1. When the procuring agency qualifies an acceptance because of anticipated
      contingencies, that agency will bill at the price determined later. In this case, the
      procuring agency will periodically advise the ordering agency of changes in the
      acceptance figure by publishing revised prices. The ordering agency will adjust the
      obligation recorded to show the current price. Air Force activities will review obligations
      at least monthly to make sure recorded amounts reflect the procuring agency’s current
      prices.
      7.19.4.2. If the procuring agency doesn’t qualify its acceptance for anticipated
      contingencies, the price in the acceptance is final. The procuring agency will bill at time
      of delivery.
  7.19.5. For direct citation procurement, Category Two:
      7.19.5.1. The ordering agency will administratively reserve funds for any contingencies
      indicated in the contract for which it is liable.
      7.19.5.2. On 1 August of each fiscal year, the procuring department will advise the
      requiring department of any Category Two MIPRs on hand citing expiring appropriations
      on which they will be unable to obligate the funds before the fund expiration date. If
      unforeseen situations after 1 August prevent executing a contract, the procuring
      department will notify the requiring department by the quickest means and return the
      MIPR with a transmittal letter stating why they couldn’t accomplish the procurement.
  7.19.6. Under Category One (consolidated-reimbursable procurement):
      7.19.6.1. Air Force activities acting as the ordering agency must budget and fund under
      applicable appropriations for all requirements to support assigned mission
      responsibilities.
      7.19.6.2. If your Air Force activity is acting as the procuring or performing agency, you
      must:
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                           133


         7.19.6.2.1. Include in budget estimates, annual financial plans, and procurement
         programs, estimated anticipated reimbursements based on known and forecasted
         requirements of the other military agencies and experience factors.
         7.19.6.2.2. Revise your procurement program to show the anticipated reimbursement
         changes in cases for which you’re financing a procurement from Air Force
         procurement appropriations. Include more funds when required as well as any
         necessary reductions. In cases for which you would need to delay action on another
         military agency’s order, fill the order and send a request for the increase in budget
         authorization and reimbursable authority to SAF/ FMBI. Include amounts required
         for funding reimbursable transactions in command requests for allocation or
         allotment.
         7.19.6.2.3. Promptly bill and obtain reimbursement from the ordering agency upon
         delivery of the articles or performance of the service. When recurring charges are
         involved, bill the ordering agency at least once a month. Do the project order
         reimbursements by processing an SF 1080, Vouchers for Transfer Between
         Appropriations and Funds, completing both certificates, and charging funds
         provided in the project order. Reference reimbursement billings to the order number.
         7.19.6.2.4. Deposit reimbursements received as appropriation reimbursements.
  7.19.7. Under Category Two (direct citation procurement):
     7.19.7.1. Air Force activities acting as the ordering agency must:
         7.19.7.1.1. Budget and fund under applicable appropriations for requirements to
         support assigned mission responsibilities
         7.19.7.1.2. Cite their funds on all orders you send to other military agencies which
         will be available to the procuring agency for citing on all obligating documents
         executed.
         7.19.7.1.3. Pay vendor’s invoices against cited Air Force funds. EXCEPTION:
         When the articles ordered are to be delivered to the procuring agency for account of,
         and storage for, the Air Force activity and you arranged for cross disbursing, the
         procuring agency pays directly against the cited Air Force funds.
     7.19.7.2. Air Force activities acting as the procuring or performing agency must:
         7.19.7.2.1. Include funds citing the ordering agency’s funds on all contracts and other
         documents the Air Force completes for the ordering agency.
         7.19.7.2.2. Cross-reference to the original order all subsidiary documents (contracts,
         delivery and payment documents, etc.) issued under an order received from another
         military agency. Make sure these documents have enough information to identify
         them, including MIPR number, contract number, and budget account classification.
         7.19.7.2.3. Promptly distribute all subsidiary documents issued under an order.
         7.19.7.2.4. Arrange for the contractor or supplier to bill the ordering agency direct.
         But, when the contractor or supplier will deliver articles to an Air Force activity for
         account of and storage for the ordering agency, the Air Force will receive the
         vendors’ invoices and pay against funds which the ordering agency authorized the Air

           Force to cite (consistent with cross-disbursing agreements between the Air Force and
           the ordering agency).
   7.19.8. Transportation bills of lading incident to cross-servicing. Charge the ordering
   agency’s appropriation directly. You must always show the agency to be billed and the
   chargeable appropriation or fund (as designated by the agency) in the bill of lading. Charge
   transportation costs for shipments by Defense Logistics Agencies (DLA) as DLA prescribes
   for their appropriations.
7.20. Processing Commitments and Obligations. Follow DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on
Accounting for Commitments and DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations.
7.21. Resolving Service Disagreements. In cases where the respective services disagree on
cross-servicing charges or financing, the MAJCOM should forward the disagreement through
appropriate channels for resolution. Include your recommendations and comments of all parties.
7.22. Joint-Use Guidance. Sometimes units or activities of one military department (tenant)
reside on another military department’s (host) installation. The host may provide facilities and
services for the tenant unit after completing a host-tenant agreement. Based on local agreements,
DoD installations also provide cross-servicing support to one service’s units or activities next to
or near another service’s installation. See DoDI 4000.19 for guidance on support for joint use
between the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Agencies. See Chapter 16 of this instruction
for Air National Guard support.

Section 7D— Support of NonDoD Departments and Agencies

7.23. Overview. The Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535) authorizes government agencies to enter
into transactions with each other when it’s in the government’s best interest. Apply this section
solely to financing orders between Air Force activities and other United States government
departments or agencies outside DoD.
   7.23.1. Unless otherwise provided for in departmental agreements, determine charges for
   materiel, work, services and overhead according to paragraph 7.17 and Chapter 1 of DoD
   7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Reimbursable Operations Policy and Programs. Compute
   industrial fund charges according to DWCF guidance.
   7.23.2. DoD activities usually waive reimbursement, except for support provided by working
   capital funds, when the accumulated value of services, materiel, and supplies furnished a
   government agency is less than $125 during a calendar quarter. But, you must obtain
   reimbursement for these smaller amounts from working capital funds.
   7.23.3. Economy Act orders issued outside the DoD require a Determination and
   Finding (D&F) from the contracting officer that documents, among other
   considerations, that the order is in the best interest of the government (FAR Subpart
   17. 5-Interagency Acquisition Under the Economy Act and DFAR Subpart 217.5)
   7.23.4. Support of U. S. Customs Service. The Air Force will provide support to the
   Federal Border Clearance Agencies (U.S. Customs Service, Department of Agriculture, and
   Immigration and Naturalization Service) at USAF Aerial Ports of entry without charge or
   reimbursement. If overtime costs are incurred by U.S. Customs Agents clearing USAF
   aircraft, the installation reimburses the Customs Service for those overtime costs. This policy
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                           135


   is consistent with DoD 5030.49-R, DoD Customs Inspection Program, Paragraph 3011.
   USTRANSCOM (TCJ4-LTP) is the DoD Executive Agent.
   7.23.5. Exception to the Economy Act. The GSA Information Technology (GSA IT) Fund,
   authorized by the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-106) (formerly known as the
   Information Technology Reform Act of 1996 (ITMRA), was exempted from the provisions
   of the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. 1535 and 1536. That is, funds, which expire at the end of a
   fiscal year, do not have to be returned to the requesting agency by the performing agency, in
   this instance the GSA IT Fund. However, there is still a binding legal requirement for an Air
   Force organization (requesting agency) to specify exactly what the funds are for and to
   comply with bona fide need and the purpose provisions of the appropriation being utilized to
   fund the effort requested. Notwithstanding any advice proffered by the GSA IT fund to the
   contrary, when funds for the specific requirement, as specified on the order, usually a MIPR,
   are excess to that requirement, they must be returned to the requesting Air Force
   organization. There is a legal prohibition on extending the life of an appropriation by
   utilizing funds, issued for a specific order, for other purposes.
7.24. Financing Economy Act Orders (31 U.S.C. 1535) (Also see paragraph 7.16.4). Use
these methods.
   7.24.1. Reimbursement Method. By agreement, the performing agency finances the order
   using its own funds and is reimbursed later by the ordering agency. The ordering agency pays
   the performing agency upon completing the order or progressively as the order is completed.
   Usually the parties complete these financial transactions by using SF 1080, Voucher for
   Transfer Between Appropriations and/or Funds. See DFAS-DE 7010.2-R for billing and
   collection procedures.
   7.24.2. Direct Citation Method. Use this method when it’s more feasible and more
   economical than the reimbursement method.
   7.24.3. Advance Payment Method. By agreement, the performing agency requires
   payment in advance from the ordering agency. The performing agency submits an SF 1080
   bill to the ordering activity that makes the advance payment. The performing agency deposits
   the advance payment in a Consolidated Working Fund or a Working Capital Fund that it then
   uses to accomplish the Economy Act order.
   7.24.4. Transfer Appropriation Method. By agreement, the ordering agency transfers its
   funds to the performing agency to finance Economy Act orders, usually for construction and
   major procurement. Departmental level only (HQ USAF, etc.) uses this method. HQ USAF
   processes an SF 1151, Non-Expenditure Transfer Authorization, through the Treasury
   Department. Under this method, the Air Force maintains the appropriation symbol from
   which funds were transferred, prefixed by the performing agency’s symbol.
7.25. Executing Economy Act Orders (31 U.S.C. 1535) (Also see paragraph 7.16.4). To the
maximum extent possible, Air Force activities will finance Economy Act orders received from or
issued to government agencies outside the DoD using the direct citation or the reimbursement
method.
   7.25.1. In exceptional cases where you can’t finance the order using these methods, advise
   SAF/ FMBM through command channels. List the pertinent facts and explain why you can’t
 136                                             AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   finance the Economy Act order using these methods. SAF/FMB will determine the financing
   method and advise the command.
   7.25.2. The method you use to finance Economy Act orders issued to another government
   agency depends mainly on the policies of that agency. But, other government agencies
   presently furnishing goods or services to the Air Force have agreed to use the reimbursement
   method of financing, if possible, except agencies listed in paragraph 7.25.3 and 7.25.4.
   7.25.3. Use advance payment to finance all Economy Act Orders issued to these agencies:

Table 7.1. Authorized Advance Payment Economy Act Orders.

Library of Congress.


Bureau of Mines, Department of the Interior.
Geological Survey, Department of the Interior.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
National Technical Information Service, Department of Commerce.
Government Printing Office.
Transportation Systems Division, Department of Transportation.
   7.25.4. SAF/FMB uses the transfer appropriation method to finance Economy Act orders
   issued by HQ USAF to the Bureau of Public Roads, Department of Transportation, to
   construct access roads. HQ USAF will transfer the funds.
   7.25.5. Obtain HQ USAF approval prior to making advance payments to agencies other than
   those indicated in paragraph 7.25.3. If another agency requests an advance payment,
   forward the request through your MAJCOM to SAF/FMBM, Washington DC 20330-1130,
   for approval.
   7.25.6. Don’t authorize or make advance payments from Air Force annual appropriations
   that exceed the estimated cost of goods or services to be furnished by the performing agency
   during the fiscal year (FY) in which you make the advance payment.
   7.25.7. The Air Force activity that makes an advance payment to agencies indicated in
   paragraph 7.25.3 above, or any others specifically approved by SAF/FMB, must complete
   and monitor all aspects of the advance payment. For advance payments made from Air Force
   appropriation accounts, you must require the performing agency to:
       7.25.7.1. Return estimated 30 September unobligated balances by 15 August of the FY in
       which you make the advance payment.
       7.25.7.2. Return unexpended balances upon completing the Economy Act order.
   7.25.8. In many instances, other government agencies that furnish goods or services to the
   Air Force operate on limited financial resources. Therefore, you must pay bills from these
   agencies promptly. Also, you must bill other government agencies promptly for goods or
   services the Air Force provides.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            137


7.26. Economy Act Order Procedures:
   7.26.1. The ordering Air Force activity may make advance payments of Air Force funds for
   orders issued to agencies listed in paragraph 7.25.3 without further recourse to HQ USAF.
   Follow procedures in DFAS-DE 7010.2-R.
   7.26.2. HQ USAF makes the appropriation transfer to the Department of Transportation
   (paragraph 7.25.4) and any others specifically approved by HQ USAF.
   7.26.3. In all other cases when other agencies don’t agree to finance Air Force orders by the
   reimbursement or direct cite method, the ordering Air Force activity will submit, through
   command channels, a request for HQ USAF determination and approval of financing
   arrangements. Send the request to SAF/FMBM, 1130 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC
   20330-1130. Include:
      7.26.3.1. A statement that the performing agency won’t accept and finance the Economy
      Act order by the reimbursement or direct cite method.
      7.26.3.2. A copy of the order sent to the performing agency, which must include a
      statement of purpose or nature of work, estimate of cost and time required to complete
      the work.
      7.26.3.3. A statement from the Air Force command that funds are available within
      existing allocations and that the requirement is included in the approved program,
      indicating appropriation, program year, and budget program.
      7.26.3.4. Other pertinent data to enable HQ USAF to evaluate the request.
   7.26.4. After receiving this information, HQ USAF will negotiate with the departmental
   headquarters of the performing agency to determine the financing method. If these
   negotiations result in the reimbursement method, direct cite method, or advance payment
   method, HQ USAF will return the case to the Air Force activity for processing. If the transfer
   appropriation method is agreed upon, HQ USAF will:
      7.26.4.1. Withdraw funds from the Air Force command or operating agency by issuing
      revised budget authorization and allocation documents or operating budget authority.
      7.26.4.2. Transfer Air Force funds to the performing agency by the transfer appropriation
      method.
      7.26.4.3. Notify the Air Force activity, through command channels, when the above
      actions are completed.
7.27. Other Methods of Funding. Some interagency transactions must comply with particular
statutory provisions, special regulations, or special arrangements.
   7.27.1. National Bureau of Standards. Air Force installations placing work order requests
   with that agency will finance them on an SF 1080 advance reimbursement basis. Conduct the
   negotiations and process the SF 1080 at installation level.
   7.27.2. United States Postal Service (USPS). Unless specifically approved by SAF/AAI,
   installations may not use ―Postage and Fees Paid‖ indicia in place of metering.
7.28. Transactions with GSA for Leased Facilities:
 138                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   7.28.1. The Air Force enters into and pays for leases ending in a current fiscal year,
   renewable from year-to-year at the option of the government, provided language to this effect
   is in the DoD Appropriations Act for that fiscal year. AFI 32-9001 has procedures for
   acquiring and funding leased facilities.
   7.28.2. The General Services Administration (GSA) may make communications services in
   leased facilities available on a reimbursement basis in certain locations where office
   buildings are large enough to warrant joint-use switchboard and teletype facilities. Contact
   the local GSA office to obtain information on specific locations. Compute charges for
   communications according to GSA Circulars No. 42 and 93.
7.29. Air Transportation Provided to Non-Defense Agencies:
   7.29.1. Guidance on furnishing air transportation for non-defense personnel and cargo is in
   DoD 4515.13-R.
   7.29.2. Procedures for processing and collecting charges for reimbursable non-defense
   traffic transported on DoD aircraft other than Air Mobility Command (TWCF) are in AFJI
   24-503, Revenue Traffic Transported on DoD Aircraft other than Airlift Service Industrial
   Fund. AMC determines reimbursement for traffic furnished by AMC (TWCF) aircraft.
7.30. Terms for Support Agreements. The support agreement must identify the categories of
support furnished and the method of funding. Normally, you furnish support on a reimbursable
basis except for insignificant support or services that aren’t readily identifiable or measurable.
Identify cross-servicing responsibilities in the terms of the agreement.

Section 7E—Civil Air Patrol (CAP) and Air Force Civil Air Patrol Liaison Offices

7.31. Overview. It is USAF policy to fulfill the requirements of P.L. 80-557, 10 U.S.C. 9441.
The CAP is a nonprofit, civilian corporation under P.L. 79-476, 36 U.S.C. 201. It receives
support from the DoD and other departments and agencies of the Federal Government under P.L.
98-961, 10 U.S.C. 9442. Additional guidance on supporting the Civil Air Patrol is contained in
AFIs 10-2701 and 32-9003.
7.32. Supporting CAP Organizations:
   7.32.1. CAP Allowable Expenses. The Air Force may disburse funds to the CAP for the
   following:
       7.32.1.1. In time of war or national emergencies, authorize the payment of travel
       expenses and allowances in accordance with Chapter 57, Subchapter I of Title 5 to
       members of the CAP while carrying out any mission specifically assigned by the Air
       Force.
       7.32.1.2. Provide funds for the National Headquarters of the CAP, including funds for
       the payment of staff compensation and benefits, administrative expenses, travel, per diem
       and allowances, rent and utilities, and other operational expenses (1995 Reorganization).
       7.32.1.3. Authorize the payment of aircraft maintenance expenses relating to operational
       missions, unit capability testing missions, and training missions.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                           139


     7.32.1.4. Authorize the payment of expenses for placing into serviceable condition major
     items of equipment (including aircraft, motor vehicles, and communications equipment)
     owned by CAP.
     7.32.1.5. Reimburse the CAP for costs incurred for the purchase of such major end items
     of equipment as the Secretary considers required by the CAP to carry out its mission
     (including aircraft, motor vehicles, and communications equipment).
     7.32.1.6. Approved aircraft orientation flights for CAP cadets.
  7.32.2. CAP Reimbursable Programs. The following CAP Programs, while not all-
  inclusive, are the primary missions that CAP can be called upon to execute on behalf of the
  Air Force: Search and Rescue/Disaster Relief (SAR/DR), Counter Drug Programs, Drug
  Demand Reduction, Aerospace Education, and Distance Learning. CAP may submit
  claims for partial or full reimbursement for expenses related to these missions. The Air Force
  will provide financial support for CAP missions, when acting in its role as the Air Force
  Auxiliary based on Air Force capability, appropriated funds availability, consideration of
  additional funding sources, and reasonableness.
  7.32.3. Specific Mission Reimbursable Costs. The following instructions supplement
  general procedures for USAF and other Government agencies’ non-combat missions and
  programs.
     7.32.3.1. USAF Search and Rescue (SAR)/Disaster Relief (DR) Missions. When
     performing SAR/DR missions as the Air Force Auxiliary, including training and
     evaluations, the Air Force will reimburse CAP for the following allowable expenses:
         7.32.3.1.1. Actual expenses for aviation/automotive fuel, lubricants, de-ice, aircraft
         preheat, mission specific/essential hanger fees, aircraft oxygen service actually used
         while enroute to/ from and while performing the mission, and fuel for portable
         generators required for the mission (actual missions only).
         7.32.3.1.2. Aircraft maintenance expenses relating to operational missions, unit
         capability testing missions, and training missions. The Air Force will reimburse CAP
         National Headquarters for aircraft maintenance on all corporate owned aircraft
         based on actual expense. CAP Wings must submit original maintenance bills through
         the National Headquarters to CAP-USAF to gain payment consideration.
         7.32.3.1.3. Maintenance costs for non-corporate owned aircraft will receive
         reimbursement based on Air Force Established Flying Hour Reimbursement Rate by
         Aircraft Type.
         7.32.3.1.4. In time of war or national emergencies, authorize the payment of travel
         expenses and allowances. The Air Force views disasters, such as floods, earthquakes,
         hurricanes, etc. in which the President of the United States declares the area of
         concern a natural disaster as a type of national emergency. In the event the CAP is
         tasked by the Air Force to provide assistance during natural disasters, travel
         reimbursement will be authorized. Travel and per diem rates are determined by CAP,
         but shall not exceed the rates established by the Joint Travel Regulations.
     7.32.3.2. Drug Interdiction and Counter Drug Activities. Congress, by statute, allows
     the CAP to increase its participation in and make significant contributions to the drug
 140                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       interdiction efforts of the Federal Government. In addition, it is the sense of Congress
       that the Secretary of the Air Force should fully support that participation. In order to fully
       support CAP Counter Drug, Demand Reduction, as well as, operational and drug
       reconnaissance training missions, the Air Force recognizes these programs as functions of
       CAP National Headquarters and will reimburse reasonable expenses directly to the
       Headquarters. When performing the subject missions, the Air Force will reimburse CAP
       for the following allowable expenses:
           7.32.3.2.1. Actually incurred operational and maintenance costs for supplies,
           equipment, travel and per diem, administrative (hiring of CAP employees and
           supplies), and maintenance costs directly associated with Drug Interdiction, Drug
           Demand Reduction, and Counter Drug activities.
           7.32.3.2.2. Travel and per diem rates are determined by CAP, but shall not exceed
           rates established by the Joint travel Regulations.
   7.32.4. Non-Allowable Expenses. The Air Force does not have the authority to reimburse
   or disburse funds to the CAP in support of the operation and maintenance of:
       7.32.4.1. Operation and maintenance support for CAP Regions or wings other than
       allowable costs associated with SAR/DR Counter Drug missions.
       7.32.4.2. Cadet Programs, Aerospace Education, and Distance Learning, except those
       costs associated with the operation and maintenance of the CAP National Headquarters,
       such as employee salaries, and cadet uniforms.
       7.32.4.3. Gifts for military members, employees, or private citizens, unless specifically
       authorized in AFI 65-603.
       7.32.4.4. Purchasing or mailing seasonal greeting or birthday cards with appropriated
       funds.
       7.32.4.5. Purchasing food, drink, or entertainment for any persons, except reimbursable
       expenses (per diem) for persons in an official travel status. This includes items related to
       food, drink, or entertainment (such as coffee pots).
7.33. Supporting Air Force-CAP Liaison Offices. Air Force-CAP liaison offices, as opposed
to CAP organizations, are USAF ―special activities.‖ HQ AU administers and accounts for funds
that finance the direct operating expenses of Air Force CAP liaison offices. Upon request of Air
Force CAP liaison offices, Commanders of Air Force activities furnish administrative and
logistical support following procedures in this chapter.
   7.33.1. The Air Force furnishes Air Force CAP liaison offices and personnel at National HQ
   CAP the following administrative and logistical support without reimbursement:
       7.33.1.1. Routine office and administrative supplies and equipment required by Air
       Force personnel assigned to Air Force liaison offices.
       7.33.1.2. Special mission aircraft, automotive, and other Air Force equipment carried on
       current Air Force accountable records and assigned for use by Air Force personnel at
       National Headquarters CAP or the Air Force liaison offices. They receive maintenance
       and supply support from the nearest Air Force base responsible for logistical support.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            141


   7.33.2. Air Force CAP liaison offices must maintain contact with CAP activities within the
   area of their assignment and, in carrying out this mission, use:
       7.33.2.1. AF Form 15, United States Air Force Invoice.
       7.33.2.2. AF Form 315, United States Air Force Avfuels Invoice.
       7.33.2.3. CAP     Form      108,    Payment/Reimbursement           Document        for
       Aviation/Automotive/Miscellaneous Expenses, to procure aircraft fuels and lubricants.
       7.33.2.4. Commercial credit cards to procure automotive fuel and lubricants and
       emergency roadside repairs.
   7.33.3. AFI 10-2701 provides guidance for disposing of and accounting for Air Force
   supplies and equipment issued to Air Force liaison offices.
   7.33.4. The Air Force CAP liaison offices are responsible for:
       7.33.4.1. Requesting logistical support from commanders of Air Force activities.
       7.33.4.2. Limiting support requested to reasonable and necessary items.
       7.33.4.3. Presenting their requirements clearly.
       7.33.4.4. Furnishing required justification data to facilitate the support by Air Force
       commanders.
       7.33.4.5. Providing Air Force oversight of AF mission related wing activities.

Section 7F—Disaster Relief in the United States, Its Territories and Possessions

7.34. Overview:
   7.34.1. Air Force Participation. The military services have historically participated in
   emergency assistance to civil authorities during periods of disaster caused by natural
   phenomena. The applicable legal authority requires us to distinguish between assistance
   provided to (1) states, territories, and possessions of the United States and (2) foreign
   countries and areas. Air Force guidance is to provide the required emergency military
   assistance to civil authorities for a limited period in domestic emergencies, using resources
   not required to do essential Air Force military missions.
   7.34.2. Implementing Authorities:
       7.34.2.1. Public Law 606, 91st Congress (42 U.S.C. Chapter 58). Authorizes federal
       assistance to states and local governments in major disasters to alleviate damage and
       suffering. If directed by the President of the United States, Federal agencies may provide
       assistance to states and local governments in keeping with the act.
       7.34.2.2. Executive Orders 11575, 11725, and 13228 (Oct 8,2001: Establishing the
       Office of Homeland Security and the Homeland Security Council).
       7.34.2.3. DoDD 3025.15, Military Assistance to Civil Authorities; DoDD 3025.16,
       Military Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officer (EPLO) Program; DoD 3025.1-M,
       Manual for Civil Emergencies (Chapter 9, Funding, Accounting, and Reimbursement);
       AFI 10-802, Military Support to Civil Authorities.

7.35. Air Force Responsibilities:
   7.35.1. Domestic Emergencies:
       7.35.1.1. The Department of the Army is the DoD executive agent. Department of the
       Army coordinates and controls military support for civil authorities in the event of
       domestic emergencies.
       7.35.1.2. The Department of the Air Force assists the Department of the Army in
       executing domestic emergency operations consistent with the Air Force’s primary
       mission:
          7.35.1.2.1. HQ Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) is the planning agent for Air
          Force participation in domestic emergencies.
          7.35.1.2.2. Each Air Force commander, as directed, assists civil authorities for a
          limited period in domestic emergencies, provided resources used are not needed for
          essential military missions. Resources provided are subject to military command and
          (excepting consumable items such as fuel, food, and clothing) are subject to recall to
          meet Air Force operational requirements.
          7.35.1.2.3. Commanders develop plans and training programs to protect personnel
          and all other resources of their commands in the event of domestic emergencies (see
          AFI 32-4001).
   7.35.2. Unified Commands. Commanders of unified commands who have within their
   geographic area the states of Alaska or Hawaii, or territories or possessions of the United
   States, are responsible for controlling and coordinating military support of disaster relief
   operations within their assigned area of responsibility.
7.36. Funding Procedures:
   7.36.1. Budget estimates, operating budgets, and financial plans don’t include funds for
   disaster relief operations. The Air Force doesn’t reserve funds for these purposes. The Air
   Force usually undertakes these operations on the basis that costs which are additive to normal
   operating expenses are reimbursed by the agency that requests Air Force participation.
   Usually, it’s necessary for the Air Force activity providing disaster relief assistance to absorb
   such costs initially within existing fund availability. HQ USAF or MAJCOMs make funding
   adjustments for these unprogrammed expenditures later to the extent possible. SAF/FMB
   may establish an Emergency and Special Program (ESP) code to identify the support costs
   associated with disaster relief operations. When you provide support before SAF/FMB
   establishes an Air Force-wide ESP code, the MAJCOM or installation providing such
   support may create its own interim ESP code (see Chapter 4, Paragraph 4.11).
   7.36.2. If an Air Force activity takes part in disaster relief, and reimbursement for the costs
   incurred is necessary, advise HQ USAF through command channels of the funds required to
   finance the relief activities.
   7.36.3. If Air Force participation in disaster relief results in expenses that are additive to
   normal operating expenses, the MAJCOM sends requests for reimbursement for major
   disaster support to DFAS-DE for consolidation and forwarding to Commander, US Army
   Forces Command, Attn: AFCO-PBO, Ft McPherson GA 30330. If the disaster or other
   emergency isn’t declared a major disaster by Presidential Proclamation, the supporting Air
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              143


  Force activity sends requests for reimbursements to the recipients of the assistance on
  completing the relief operations for each specific disaster, or at the end of each fiscal quarter
  if the disaster is of extended duration. Requests for reimbursement must contain enough
  detail to identify and segregate:
     7.36.3.1. Personal services.
     7.36.3.2. Travel and per diem.
     7.36.3.3. All other expenses including those that apply to emergency assistance rendered
     at the specific request of a Regional Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency
     (FEMA), before declaration of a major disaster.
     7.36.3.4. Such other costs or expenditures as the Administration, FEMA, and the
     Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may approve, based on the
     justification submitted. Requests for reimbursement must cite the specific request for
     assistance issued by a Regional Director, FEMA, under which costs were incurred and
     the state in which assistance was furnished.
  7.36.4. Expenses incurred for disaster relief participation may include:
     7.36.4.1. Pay of additional civilian personnel temporarily hired specifically for the
     disaster operation.
     7.36.4.2. Overtime pay of civilian personnel.
     7.36.4.3. Travel and per diem expenses of Air Force personnel (military and civilian).
     7.36.4.4. Consumable items of supply requisitioned for civilian disaster refugees.
     7.36.4.5. Transportation of personnel, supplies, and equipment.
     7.36.4.6. Repairing or reconditioning nonconsumable items returned.
     7.36.4.7. Repair parts used to repair end items located at the disaster area (excluding
     depot or field maintenance on a timecompliance basis).
     7.36.4.8. Packing and crating supplies and equipment.
     7.36.4.9. Petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL).
     7.36.4.10. Items of supplies and equipment lost, destroyed, or damaged beyond
     economical repair.
  7.36.5. FEMA bears the cost of any major rehabilitation or modification of real property
  under control of the Air Force that FEMA requires and which alters the property to an extent
  that affects its future use by the Air Force.
  7.36.6. The following items aren’t eligible for reimbursement in connection with disaster
  relief assistance, but are normal operating expenses:
     7.36.6.1. Regular pay and allowances of Air Force personnel (except travel and per diem
     costs).
     7.36.6.2. Administrative overhead costs.
     7.36.6.3. Annual and sick leave, retirement, and other military or civilian benefits.

       7.36.6.4. Cost of telephone, telegram, or other means of electrical transmission used to
       requisition items into a disaster area, or to replenish depot stocks.
   7.36.7. Major commanders must have a prior understanding with Regional Directors,
   FEMA; directors, American Red Cross area offices; and state and local government
   authorities regarding requisitioning and reimbursement responsibilities on the part of the
   requesting agency. Also, commanders should reach prior agreement on the validity of
   charges claimed by the Air Force under exceptional circumstances. For example, it may be
   necessary for components of other military services to furnish personnel, supplies, ground
   safety, equipment, etc., by means of airlift, airdrop, or other emergency means. In many
   instances, authorized representatives of the requesting agency aren’t at the disaster scene to
   certify delivery, performance, etc. Therefore, the agreements should provide that claims for
   costs of such supplies and services, as well as incidental costs, are valid and will constitute
   proper claims for reimbursement.

Section 7G—Disaster Relief in Foreign Countries

7.37. Overview. The Department of State, including the Agency for International Development
(AID), determines when emergency foreign disaster relief is to be provided as a humanitarian
service, consistent with United States foreign policy goals. The Department of State delegates
authority to the chiefs of diplomatic missions to obligate up to $25,000 for each disaster
emergency. It also provides timely information to the Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense,
International Security Affairs (OASD/ISA) for requirements of specific disaster relief operations.
OASD/ISA informs the DoD Comptroller (DoD(C)) of the contemplated use of funds or
resources for foreign disaster relief operations. Based on this information, DoD(©initiates
appropriate financial or funding actions.
7.38. Air Force Guidance. Subject to overriding military mission requirements, MAJCOMs
and operating units must respond rapidly to requests for assistance in specific foreign disaster
relief operations received from United States diplomatic missions, Department of State/Agency
for International Development (AID), orders from Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), unified or
specified commands, or from HQ USAF.
   7.38.1. The Chief of the Diplomatic Mission or the Department of State/AID must specify in
   advance the amount of funds authorized for expenditure for foreign disaster relief. Air Force
   activities can’t exceed this specified amount unless the Department of State/AID authorizes
   an additional amount.
   7.38.2. Air Force activities should undertake disaster relief operations expected to involve
   reimbursable costs that aren’t to be funded from, or which will exceed, the $25,000 available
   to the Chief of the Diplomatic Mission only after Department of State/AID furnishes
   OASD(ISA) the appropriate authorization for the funds required.
   7.38.3. But, an Air Force installation commander in the area of a foreign disaster undertakes
   prompt relief operations when humanitarian or mercy considerations make it advisable. Such
   disaster relief operations must be on the basis of the minimum essential required to preclude
   embarrassment to the United States. If such occurs, installation commanders must
   immediately advise the appropriate unified commander and MAJCOM of the action taken
   and request further guidance.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             145


7.39. Funding Procedures. Air Force financial plans and appropriations don’t provide for
foreign disaster relief operations. Therefore, costs incurred by Air Force activities to support
disaster relief operations are reimbursable from the Department of State or AID. SAF/FMB may
establish an ESP code to identify these costs. If you incur costs before then, set up an interim
MAJCOM or installation ESP code (see Chapter 4, Paragraph 4.11).
   7.39.1. Reimbursable Expenses.
       7.39.1.1. Reimbursable expenses include, but aren’t limited to:
           7.39.1.1.1. Pay of all regular employed civilian personnel, both United States citizens
           and foreign nationals, who take part in the relief operation. For United States citizen
           personnel, compute costs on basic salary plus appropriate percent (DFAS-DE 7010.2-
           R) to cover holidays, leave, and other benefits. For foreign national personnel,
           compute on the basis of total cost to the United States.
           7.39.1.1.2. All costs of additional civilian personnel employed specifically for the
           operation.
           7.39.1.1.3. Overtime pay of all civilian personnel attributable to participation in the
           operation.
           7.39.1.1.4. Actual per diem, travel, and subsistence expenses for both military and
           civilian personnel.
           7.39.1.1.5. Pay and allowances of all military personnel participating in the relief
           operations (see Chapter 5, Paragraph 5.4.4).
           7.39.1.1.6. Supplies and equipment from stock or special one-time purchases using
           standard prices used for issue to DoD activities, plus applicable accessorial costs for
           packing, crating, handling, and transportation.
           7.39.1.1.7. Transportation of personnel, equipment, and supplies.
           7.39.1.1.8. Accessorial costs and transportation cost associated with transferring
           excess items to Department of State/AID without reimbursement for the actual items
           transferred.
           7.39.1.1.9. Packing, crating, and handling of equipment and supplies at actual cost.
           7.39.1.1.10. Use of equipment on a rate per mile or similar factor determined from
           the latest cost reports. The cost of equipment loaned and not returned is reimbursable.
           The cost of returned equipment in damaged condition is chargeable at repair cost.
           Consider the cost of processing equipment in and out of storage as well as
           maintenance requirements upon return of the equipment.
           7.39.1.1.11. Use of military aircraft is chargeable on the basis of hours flown as
           provided in applicable instructions. Rates include reimbursement for aircraft use,
           including normal crew per diem, fuel and oil, maintenance (including local purchase
           of spare parts and depot maintenance), and aircraft attrition. Additional expenses,
           such as for deicing, landing fees, parking fees, and other like expenses must be
           separately computed because they are not included in hourly rates.
 146                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       7.39.1.2. Price all other services or support rendered not specifically covered in
       paragraph 7.39.1 above on a mutually agreed to basis. When feasible, establish such
       prices before giving the support. Use prices charged other United States government
       agencies for similar services, if these rates are available. Otherwise, compute prices to
       fully reimburse Air Force appropriations for ―out-of pocket‖ expenses.
   7.39.2. Nonreimbursable expenses are normally limited to materials, supplies, and
   equipment determined to be excess and transferred to the Department of State/AID.
   Accessorial costs and transportation associated with transferring excess property are
   reimbursable.
   7.39.3. Billing Procedures. Follow DFAS-DE 7010.2-R.
7.40. Documentation Requirements. Installation FSOs or regional Defense Accounting
Offices participating in disaster relief operations must obtain documentation to support billings,
set up accounts receivable, and obtain reimbursement. Consider using daily cost progress reports
because of the expenditure limitations described in paragraph 7.38. Keep statistical data on
military personnel expenses and other nonreimbursable costs for informational and historical
purposes.

       (*)The Secretary of the military department charged with determining United States
       national requirements and providing logistical and administrative support to a United
       States element in a specific area.
7.43. Cross-Servicing. In carrying out the responsibilities indicated above, the designated
administrative agent will use interservice support to the maximum extent possible. Such
interservice support will be on a cross-servicing basis. Don’t establish support activity where
such support can be rendered by an agency at an existing facility in the same general
geographical area or where the service can be economically performed from indigenous sources.
In areas where a unified command exercises jurisdiction, the unified command coordinates with
activities of the administrative agents concerned.
7.44. Reimbursable Support:
   7.44.1. The appropriate administrative agent is responsible for providing services (other than
   personal) or materiel to international military organizations, headquarters, or agencies, on an
   outright sale or lease basis. Limit the services and materiel to those normally used by United
   States forces and available to the administrative agent from overseas or domestic United
   States military sources, including those of other military departments. In order to ascertain
   the impact that international requests may have on its logistics operations, the administrative
   agent may coordinate directly with the international customer to obtain:
       7.44.1.1. Estimated United States fiscal year logistical support requirements.
       7.44.1.2. Estimated breakdown of requirements to indicate support which will be
       requested either on an outright sale or lease basis.
   7.44.2. The administrative agent should obtain written understanding regarding the items it
   will furnish under an outright sale or lease arrangement. Include a statement as to the agreed
   sale or rental value of the item and the approval of appropriate higher authority in the
   international organization.
 150                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   7.44.3. Except for organizational equipment of United States support units (which is desired
   for return to the United States), the administrative agent should encourage the international
   customer to purchase, rather than lease, the requisitioned materiel. If the life expectancy of
   the item is less than 3 years, or has a value less than $5,000, furnish it only under outright
   sales arrangement.
   7.44.4. For items priced $5,000 or more furnished under lease arrangements, charge rent on
   an indefinite basis according to paragraph 7.46.
   7.44.5. OSD will reimburse the appropriate military department in full for support furnished
   on an outright sale basis, as well as for annual rental of leased equipment.
   7.44.6. Make invoices for reimbursable issues on the basis of constructive delivery. When a
   military department other than that of the administrative agent supplies the international
   customers requirement, the supplying department must bill the administrative agent on SF
   1080 and be reimbursed without delay by the administrative agent. Subsequently, the
   administrative agent must obtain reimbursement under paragraph 7.45.
7.45. Reimbursement Procedure:
   7.45.1. The military department furnishing the materiel or services for which a
   reimbursement is due will originate an SF 1080, billing OSD, except as noted in paragraph
   7.45.3 below.
   7.45.2. The comptroller of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) or the
   international organization concerned, after reviewing his or her copies of the SF 1080A, must
   notify OSD that the charge has been accepted and credit has been given to the United States
   government on the offset accounts for the amount approved. OSD will then execute and
   return the SF 1080, Vouchers for Transfers Between Appropriations and/or Funds, to the
   billing office for payment and reimburse-ment.
   7.45.3. EXCEPTION: When furnishing materiel or services on a reimbursable basis to
   international military organizations or headquarters located in the CONUS and to which
   contributions are made in U.S. dollars for use in their normal operations, the military
   department furnishing the materiel or services will bill the international military organization,
   headquarters, or agency directly and obtain immediate reimbursement in U.S. dollars.
7.46. DoD Guidance. DoD established specific guidance for reimbursable support provided
international military headquarters and other international agencies:
   7.46.1. Pricing Guidance and Accessorial Charges. See AFMAN 23-110 and section C,
   chapter 5 of AFI 65-601.
   7.46.2. Leasing Guidance:
       7.46.2.1. Determine the annual lease rental price as follows:
          7.46.2.1.1. Price of equipment computed according to pricing guidance, plus
          accessorial charges divided by service life.
          7.46.2.1.2. Items priced at $5,000 or more: estimated service life following
          instructions of the administrative agent (including obsolescence considerations for
          specialized types of equipment). When life expectancy of the item is less than 3 years,
          furnish it only under a sales agreement.

          7.46.2.1.3. Pay equipment rental semiannually.
      7.46.2.2. Leases must contain provisions requiring the international headquarters or
      agency to assume all responsibility for liability suits resulting from international use of
      the property brought against the United States government by reason of the fact that the
      title to lease equipment is vested in the United States.
      7.46.2.3. Prepare equipment leases following departmental guidance of the
      administrative agent. (NOTE: establish a separate charge for the cost of all maintenance
      of leased equipment. This guidance also applies to equipment transferred under an
      outright or deferred sale arrangement.)
   7.46.3. Services:
      7.46.3.1. Price personal services at actual cost. For United States civilian employees, this
      is the cost of direct labor, plus appropriate percent (per DFAS-DE 7010.2-R) of direct
      labor to cover annual leave, holidays, sick leave, and contributions for group life
      insurance, civil service retirement, and health benefits. For indigenous employees,
      compute total cost to the United States. Civilian housing allowances in overseas areas are
      reimbursable at actual cost of current established rates.
      7.46.3.2. Charge for utility services at actual cost.
      7.46.3.3. Charge for transportation services on the basis of one of the following: actual
      cost; application of accessorial percentage appropriate to the area in which the
      transportation is furnished; Air Mobility Command (AMC) or Military Sealift Command
      (MSC) tariff rates under the DWCF.
      7.46.3.4. Service contract charges will include replacement factors based on average
      service life, costs for field maintenance, and accessorial charges where appropriate. Initial
      charges under a service contract must have the concurrence of the appropriate
      international comptroller.
7.47. Paying United States Personnel:
   7.47.1. Civilian employees of the United States government assigned or detailed to
   organizations listed in paragraph 7.49 retain their status as federal employees. Pay them
   from federal funds (usually, O&M) using the federal pay and allowance scale.
   7.47.2. If a United States military member fills the civilian position, budget and report as
   follows:
      7.47.2.1. Charge the military incumbent charge to the military personnel ceiling of the
      appropriate military department.
      7.47.2.2. Pay and allowances are at United States scales and are the responsibility of the
      individual’s military service.
   7.47.3. The DoD Regional Office will periodically check the validity of amounts credited to
   the United States for pay and allowances of referenced organizations. NATO auditors
   provide a double verification during each annual audit.
7.48. Costs Included and Excluded from International Budgets. International military
headquarters and agencies approved for international financial support may include in their
 152                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011

  7.48.2. The following costs aren’t part of the international budget. The nation providing the
  personnel, materiel, or services from which the costs arise will budget for these costs.
  (NOTE: these are called ―National Budget Costs,‖ and aren’t usually part of the international
  budget)
      7.48.2.1. Personnel Support:

       IMH.

Section 7I—Use of Air Force Research and Test Facilities

7.49. Overview. This section prescribes funding procedures for using Air Force research and
test facilities. See paragraph 7.50 for budget and funding responsibilities for the Air Force
Research Laboratory (AFRL). See AFI 99-101 and paragraph 7.51 for guidance on major
ranges and test facilities. The guidance in this section applies to these users of AFMC facilities:
Air Force organizations; other DoD users such as Army and Navy; other federal government
agencies; state and local government agencies; US domestic commercial users; and foreign
governments.
7.50. Budgeting and Funding of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL):
   7.50.1. AFMC budgets and funds for the costs to develop, operate, and maintain AFRL in
   support of assigned development programs and associated test workload.
   7.50.2. The users of AFRL, as identified in paragraph 7.49, budget and fund for
   reimbursable costs incurred by AFMC in supporting user workloads according to the
   following criteria.
       7.50.2.1. Air Force organizations reimburse the performing Air Force Research
       Laboratory (AFRL) technical directorates for all RDT&E direct costs incurred in support
       of user workload, excluding military labor, which are directly attributable to direct job
       (customer) orders. In addition, AFRL technology directorates will reallocate funds and
       also charge to its internal Advanced Technology Development program non-military
       indirect and overhead costs related to the program.
   7.50.3. Direct costs are those expenses that can reasonably, economically, and consistently
   be immediately and directly identified to a customer (user) program or project and are
   documented on a job order. Direct costs may derive from contractor support or work
   performed in-house. Direct costs subject to reimbursement normally include, but are not
   necessarily limited to:
       7.50.3.1. Military labor costed at standard rates. (NOTE: Military labor is not
       reimbursable from DoD users).
       7.50.3.2. Civilian labor costs including the costs of related personnel benefits.
       7.50.3.3. Materiel, supplies, and utilities.
       7.50.3.4. Equipment and its maintenance and repair due to usage. Installation of
       equipment and its removal, if it has no further base or factory use after the job order is
       completed.
       7.50.3.5. Miscellaneous contractual services, including T&E activity operation and
       maintenance contractual services.
       7.50.3.6. Printing, photos, and reproduction.
 156                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       7.50.3.7. Maintenance and depot level reparable costs of test support aircraft and ground
       support equipment to include a pro rata share of depot level maintenance.
       7.50.3.8. Travel and per diem to support customer user programs, after acceptance of a
       job order.
       7.50.3.9. Transportation and cost of supplies and equipment or other material identified
       as direct costs.
       7.50.3.10. Civil engineering work requirements established by a customer.
       7.50.3.11. Facility operations when the entire facility is dedicated to a specific user.
       7.50.3.12. Real property leases dedicated to a customer program.
       7.50.3.13. Automated data processing equipment (ADPE) support, including prorated
       rental and maintenance charges, billed to customers through product service rates.
       7.50.3.14. Additional communications, special electric power, or similar requirements.
   7.50.4. Other DoD components reimburse performing the AFRL for all direct and indirect
   costs incurred in support of user workload, excluding military labor.
   7.50.5. United States government agencies, other than DoD components, reimburse
   performing AFRL technical directorates for all direct and indirect costs incurred, including
   military labor.
   7.50.6. State and local government agencies, United States domestic commercial users and
   foreign governments reimburse performing AFRL technical directorates for all direct and
   indirect costs incurred, including military labor and full user charges according to DoD FMR
   7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapters 1 and 4.
   7.50.7. Where mutual benefit exists and joint participation is desirable, share total direct
   costs in direct ratio to the amount of benefit received by each participant, subject to
   negotiation between the laboratory and the user on a case-by-case basis.
   7.50.8. Directors of AFRL technical directorates may waive reimbursement from Air Force
   customers up to $20,000 on a case-by-case basis. This permits the laboratory directors to
   provide informal support, to assist O&M-funded commanders in performing vital Air Force
   activities (for example, accident investigation, assistance with an engine problem, analysis of
   a structural problem, etc.). Generally, informal support is effort the laboratory may provide
   on a quick-reaction basis to an Air Force customer who has not had an opportunity to
   program and budget for the requirement, in contrast to formal support, which is more long-
   term in nature and which the customer usually programs and budgets.
7.51. Funding Responsibilities for Designated Major Ranges and Test Facilities. The
Secretary of Defense designated the following Air Force activities as DoD major ranges and test
facilities (see AFI 99-101):

Table 7.2. Major Ranges and Test Facilities.

45th Space Wing (Air Force Space Command Eastern Range), Patrick AFB
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               157


30th Space Wing (Air Force Space Command Western Range, Vandenburg AFB
Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Arnold AFS
Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB (also has management responsibility over the
Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) at Hill AFB)
46 Test Wing, Eglin AFB
Air Force Development Manufacturing and Modification Facility (AFDMMF), WrightPatterson
AFB
  7.51.1. Effective beginning 1 October 2005 (FY 2006), and in accordance with Section 232
  of the FY 2003 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the institutional and overhead
  costs of facilities or resources within Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) program
  areas are to be funded through the major test and evaluation type/related budget accounts.
  Charges to DoD customers for these facilities or resources will be only the direct costs
  readily identifiable to, and consumed by, the use of the facility or resource for testing under
  a particular program.
      7.51.1.1. Institutionally funded (appropriated) and Overhead (indirect) costs will not be
      charged to DoD Component users, and will remain as costs fully borne by the
      Institutionally funded program element accounts comprising the MRTFB structure.
      Institutional and Overhead costs are defined as the jointly or commonly used costs of
      maintaining, operating, upgrading, and modernizing the facility or resource. Overhead
      (indirect) costs will not include any incremental cost directly attributable to the use of the
      facility or resource for testing under a particular program.
         7.51.1.1.1. Examples of chargeable direct costs include labor, material, facilities,
         minor construction, utilities, equipment, supplies, items damaged or consumed during
         testing, specific calibration of instrumentation when part of a range operation
         supporting a specific customer, maintenance, and operational costs directly
         attributable to a specific program.
      7.51.1.2. Examples of indirect costs include time-based preventative maintenance and
      maintenance due to usage, the costs of leases except when the cost of said lease can be
      directly associated with a specific customer, building a capability not directly identifiable
      to a specific customer, general calibration of instrumentation, maintenance and repair of
      shop machinery, replacement of obsolete components, and purchase of spares.
  7.51.2. Non-DoD Component Users. This includes Federal, State or Local Government
  agencies, allied foreign governments, defense contractors, and when authorized, private
  organizations and U.S. commercial enterprise customers. MRTFB commanders shall charge
  all direct costs associated with a customer order. Chargeable direct costs include labor,
  material, facilities, minor construction specifically performed for the customer, utilities,
  equipment, supplies, and other resources damaged or consumed during testing or maintained
  for a particular user. Chargeable direct cost incurred by non-Working Capital Fund activities
  for other than DoD Components shall include all military personnel costs associated with a
  customer order. MRTFB Commanders shall charge an appropriate amount of indirect costs.
  Any indirect costs incurred, but not billed to a customer, shall be billed to the activity’s
 158                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   institutional funds. Institutional funding levels, however, shall not be increased to finance
   any additional indirect cost incurred due to sales to non-DoD activities.
       7.51.2.1. The Commander of the Major Range and Test Facility Installation may
       delegate the authority to determine the appropriateness of the amount of indirect costs
       included in such a contract provision. Neither military retirement, unfunded civilian
       retirement, asset capitalization, nor depreciation shall be charged to the commercial
       customer. However, there are three exceptions to using provisions under P.L. 103-160.
          7.51.2.1.1. First, commercial space launch activity at the 30th and 45th Space Wings
          will be priced under provisions of the Commercial Launch Act of 1984 (amended in
          1988 and 1991).
          7.51.2.1.2. Second, when the use of a T&E activity has been included in a
          contractual agreement with a commercial user as government-furnished services, the
          commercial user will be charged based on the category of the contractual federal
          agency (DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 11A, Chapter 12).
          7.51.2.1.3. Third, foreign government will be billed full cost, unless a government
          agreement is in force (treaty, foreign military sales (FMS) agreement, or other
          negotiated agreement). Reimbursable orders will indicate if the test effort is in
          support of FMS. Commercial users will meet the requirements of the requirements in
          Support of Non-government Test and Evaluation. In some cases the direction in
          Domestic Technology Transfer, may apply.
   7.51.3. Satisfy these criteria before using standard rates: (NOTE: ―standard rates‖ are
   computed cost rates that are set up for products and services and used to determine charges to
   the job order. By definition, standard rates are a pro-ration of direct costs across the base to
   which they are applied. They are average costs that can be used in estimating and charging,
   and the use of such rates is encouraged.)
       7.51.3.1. The rates must be applicable to the product or service. Costs of products and
       services that drastically change or volume that cannot be easily identified won’t be
       considered for standard rate computation.
       7.51.3.2. Major range and test facilities must use an approved accounting system or
       procedure to accumulate historical standard rate data providing for an audit trail.
       7.51.3.3. Major range and test facilities must validate standard rates at least annually.
       Adjust the rate if a rate cannot be validated within plus or minus five percent.

Section 7J—Support of Civil Disturbances

7.52. Funding Guidance:
   7.52.1. Follow this section when using military resources in civil disturbance control
   operations in the CONUS. Guidance for civil disturbance control operations in Alaska,
   Hawaii, and the territories and possessions of the United States is a responsibility of the
   commander of the unified command for the area involved. See USAF Oplan 355-10.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             159


   7.52.2. Air Force support provided in civil disturbance control operations will be on a
   reimbursable basis. The supporting Air Force activity will initially finance the cost involved
   from available resources.
   7.52.3. Reimbursable costs are those costs that would otherwise not have been incurred, that
   is, costs in excess of normal operating expenses.
   7.52.4. When applicable, civilian personnel services are reimbursable based on direct labor
   costs plus appropriate percent (per DFAS-DE 7010.2-R) for accrued leave and fringe
   benefits, additional hires, and overtime costs.
   7.52.5. Loan of protective items is on a reclaimable basis. The Air Force activity must
   request reimbursement for nonconsumable Air Force property lost, damaged, or destroyed. In
   case of damaged property, reimbursement will be for reduced utility value. The lending
   agency determines reduced utility value.
   7.52.6. Usually, Air Force activities providing support for the civil disturbance control
   operation must absorb such costs initially within existing fund availability.

Section 7K—Support of Civil Authorities in Airplane Hijacking Emergencies

7.53. Funding Guidance. It is DoD guidance to commit military resources in a support
capacity to other federal agencies in connection with airplane hijacking emergencies. Follow this
guidance:
   7.53.1. Reimbursement is required for expenses incident to chase aircraft.
   7.53.2. Cost of other support, including use of transport aircraft, helicopters, flares,
   parachutes, and communication equipment is also on a reimbursable basis. This includes cost
   of repairing or reconditioning nonconsumable equipment that may be returned.
   7.53.3. Use MAJCOM or installation level ESP codes to identify these costs (see Chapter 4,
   Paragraph 4.11).
   7.53.4. Bill the agencies requesting the service according to DFAS-DE 7010.2-R.

Section 7L—Support of the United States Secret Service

7.54. Statutory Basis and Implementing Directives:
   7.54.1. Public Laws 90-331 and 94-524 are the statutory basis for DoD support related to
   United States Secret Service protective responsibilities. The Presidential Protection Act of
   1976 (18 U.S.C. 3056), Public Law 94-524, is an express exception to the Posse Comitatus
   Act of 1976 (18 U.S.C. 1385).
   7.54.2. DoD Directive 3025.13 details types of support and the procedures to be used within
   DoD for support requested by the Secret Service. See DFAS-DE 7010.1-R, DFAS-DE
   7010.2-R, and DFAS-DE 7220.3-R for specific accounting and reporting instructions.
7.55. Funding Guidance:
   7.55.1. Public Law 94-524 authorizes OSD support, on request by the Secret Service, to
   protect the President, Vice President, or other offices immediately next in order of succession
   to the Office of the President. The Air Force provides temporary support on a non-
 160                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   reimbursable basis, and permanent support on a reimbursable basis (see DFAS-DE 7010.2-R)
   for any Secret Service designated protectee.)
   7.55.2. Public Law 90-331, coupled with Public Law 94-524, Section 8, is the statutory basis
   for support to the Secret Service in protection of Presidential and Vice-Presidential
   candidates. This type of support is reimbursable, including temporary support, when
   requested by the Secret Service.

Section 7M— JointUse Facilities

7.56. Overview. This section provides uniform guidance on programming and financing joint-
use facilities at military installations. It implements DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 2B, Chapter 6,
Paragraph 060301 B.9. Apply these procedures when:
   7.56.1. Two or more DoD components jointly use any DoD installation and military
   construction is required.
   7.56.2. Any military department uses facilities on DoD installations controlled by another
   department.
   7.56.3. Military departments and defense agencies occupy DoD installations under host-
   tenant relationships.
   7.56.4. Two or more DoD components directly or uniquely benefit from the provision of
   facilities in support of programs and operations (common-purpose facilities).
7.57. Responsibilities for Military Construction. Program and finance military construction
as follows:
   7.57.1. Single-Use Facilities. The DoD component requiring military construction solely
   for its own use will program, obtain authorization when necessary, and finance the work
   involved.
   7.57.2. Joint-Use Facilities. The military department which has jurisdiction over the host
   command will program, obtain authorization when necessary, and finance military
   construction which is planned for the joint use or joint occupancy of two or more DoD
   components.
   7.57.3. Common-Purpose Facilities. The individual military departments, on a case-by-
   case basis, function as executive agents (i.e., Air Force for CENTCOM) for programs whose
   output directly and uniquely operate to the benefit of two or more DoD components.
       7.57.3.1. The affected DoD components sponsor requests for appropriate dedicated
       facilities for inclusion in the ―Military Construction Defense Agencies‖ program upon
       assignment or assumption of executive agency responsibility.
       7.57.3.2. The executive agent is responsible for: planning and programming all facilities;
       preparation of justification materials for incorporation in the Defense Agency books to be
       submitted to congressional committees; providing the lead witness for testimony before
       congressional committees; and military construction through use of the appropriate
       government construction agency upon receipt of authorization and funding.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             161


   7.57.4. Required Facilities. The host military department programs, obtains authorization,
   and finances an extension, expansion, and/or increase of the capacity in the main utilities and
   communications or transportation systems in general accordance with the master plan of the
   installation, to support any required facilities, including those required by a tenant.
      7.57.4.1. The Secretary of Defense must approve deviations from this procedure for
      circumstances involving unusual conditions.
      7.57.4.2. The DoD components requiring the facility will program, obtain authorization,
      and finance transportation systems, communications, connecting utilities as an integral
      part of any single-use or common-purpose facility.
   7.57.5. Siting Facilities. The siting of any facility for a tenant DoD component must
   conform to the master plan of the installation or be in accordance with an agreed-upon
   location by the DoD components concerned.
      7.57.5.1. Standards of design and construction must conform to those of the host military
      department, as provided for in the master plan of subject base or installation.
      7.57.5.2. Exceptions are made in those instances where tactical or other operational
      considerations requiring limited duration of occupancy would not economically justify
      construction of facilities to higher standards.
   7.57.6. Utilization:
      7.57.6.1. The tenant DoD component or executive agent has exclusive use of any facility
      constructed for the duration of that DoD component’s requirement. The facility will be
      made available to the host military department for utilization, without exchange of funds,
      upon termination of tenancy or use by the sponsoring military department.
      7.57.6.2. The host military department makes the facility, or an acceptable existing
      facility, available within a reasonable time period to the tenant DoD component or
      executive agent if the tenant DoD component has a requirement for use of the same
      facility at a later date.
      7.57.6.3. The host military department will not construct or acquire a new facility for the
      tenant DoD component or executive agent instead of returning the original facility or an
      acceptable existing substitute.
      7.57.6.4. The tenant DoD component or executive agent is responsible for obtaining a
      new facility if the host military department is unable to provide a facility to the tenant
      DoD component or executive agent without creating unacceptable conditions for the host
      military department.
7.58. Maintenance and Service Support. The DoD components concerned determine the
levels of maintenance and service support and the reimbursement therefore. These
determinations should be in consonance with existing agreements between two or more DoD
components, provided such agreements conform to DoD policies.

                                           Chapter 8

 AIR FORCE PROCUREMENT APPROPRIATIONS (57*3010, 57*3011, 57*3020, AND
                           57*3080)

Section 8A—General Guidance

8.1. Scope and Availability of Appropriations:
   8.1.1. Use these appropriations to finance: (See AFMAN 65-604 for specific projects.)
       8.1.1.1. Weapons procurement
       8.1.1.2. Procurement of Aircraft
       8.1.1.3. Procurement of Space Systems (Air Force Space Command - AFSPC)
       8.1.1.4. Training devices
       8.1.1.5. Support equipment
       8.1.1.6. Munitions (see paragraph 8.1.4 below)
       8.1.1.7. Vehicular equipment
       8.1.1.8. Communications and electronic equipment
       8.1.1.9. Other organizational and base support equipment
       8.1.1.10. All services and materiel provided by contractors or the Defense Working
       Capital Funds (DWCF) for update kits and modification including installation, and for
       qualification and acceptance tests during the acquisition cycle. Exclude any temporary
       duty travel of participating operating commands.
       8.1.1.11. Program Management Administration (PMA) costs of mission essential
       program office operations – which includes TDY (See paragraph 8.50 for limitations.)
       8.1.1.12. Transition planning for depot activation.
   8.1.2. Use these appropriations for new obligations only for the 3 fiscal years designated in
   the appropriation act and identified in the Treasury Department’s official symbols and titles
   for federal accounts. For example, appropriation 570/23010 is available for obligation from 1
   October 1999 through 30 September 2002, after which it expires for new obligations. When
   the appropriation expires, use it only to liquidate obligations and make authorized obligation
   adjustments for 5 more years under its original Treasury symbol. (See Chapter 6,
   Paragraph 6.4.2).
   8.1.3. If you cannot obligate specific programs within the period for which funds were
   justified and approved, you must budget any additional funding required to complete them in
   future years as new requirements.
   8.1.4. 3011 Appropriation, Procurement of Ammunition. This appropriation, also
   referred to as BP35, provides for procurement of direct and indirect munitions and related
   equipment (except guided missile warheads). BP35 includes rockets, cartridges, practice
   bombs, general purpose bombs, spare and repair parts, modifications, flares, small arms, and
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                          163


   other miscellaneous items. Items included in the miscellaneous category include Explosive
   Ordnance Disposal (EOD) demolition explosives, and explosive tool kits (to exclude EOD
   robots), grenades, nuclear trainers, etc. The 3011 Appropriation (BP35), formerly BP8100 in
   the Other Procurement, Air Force Appropriation (OPAF) (3080) through FY94, became a
   separate appropriation in FY95.
   8.1.5. Expense/Investment Threshold. The expense/investment threshold, established by
   law (Annual Appropriations Act General Provisions), is currently $250,000. Equipment and
   items costing in excess of $250,000 shall be funded in the Procurement Appropriations
   only, not with O&M funds. Any equipment or items, in excess of $250,000, funded with
   O&M prior to the publication date of this AFI remain valid obligations and expenditures. No
   reversal of fund cites is to be accomplished.
8.2. Depot Level Reparables (DLR):
   8.2.1. Air Force item managers pay for DLR parts from the Defense Working Capital Fund
   (DWCF), Supply Management business area. This includes replenishment spares previously
   procured in the Aircraft Procurement (3010, BP 1500) and Other Procurement (3080, BPs
   8200, 8300, 8400). Air Force operational activities will use local O&M funds to purchase
   DLRs from the DWCF.
   8.2.2. Don’t use the DWCF to pay for:
      8.2.2.1. Initial and replenishment spares for munitions coded and managed items
      financed from the 3010 (BP 1600), 3020 (BP 2600) and 3011(BP 3500) appropriations.
      Initial spares are funded by the procurement appropriations, but the acquisition of the
      items is done by MSD and reimbursed by the procurement appropriations upon delivery
      of the item.
      8.2.2.2. Non-stock listed items, e.g., classified and Contractor Logistics Support (CLS)
      programs.
   8.2.3. Use the DWCF, Materiel Support Division. AFMC or AFSPC will reimburse the
   DWCF from the central procurement appropriations (3010, 3020 and 3080), based on
   delivery of the items to the DWCF.
8.3. Full Funding. See DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 2, for guidance on full funding, advance
procurement, multiyear procurement, advance Economic Order Quantity, and Engineering
Change Orders/Engineering Change Proposals.
   8.3.1. Award fee requirements are planned and budgeted for as part of the total weapon
   system cost. Award fees are a bona fide need of the same fiscal year and appropriation that
   finances the related effort on which the award fee is based. They are inherently inseparable
   from the work with which they are associated. Therefore, DoD full funding policy mandates
   award fee requirements be budgeted in and funded with the same appropriation and in the
   same fiscal year as the associated effort. Until the determination has been made that a
   contractor is due an award fee, the award fee funds are committed as a contingent
   liability, not obligated. (See DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 3, Chapter. 8, Paragraph 080202.A.)
   However, if funds committed as a contingent liability expire or become expired when the
   award fee is decided, approval must be obtained for an upward obligation adjustment (per
   direction in Chapter 6 of this volume) before the funds may be obligated.
 164                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


8.4. Weapon System Engineering. MAJCOMs, installations, Air Force Materiel Command
(AFMC Centers), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) for Space Systems, and program offices
must select the correct funding category for weapon system engineering. In general, funding
covers engineering for development, production, and maintenance.
   8.4.1. Development Engineering. Use the RDT&E appropriation.
   8.4.2. Production Engineering. To fund production engineering for items in production,
   use the applicable budget program (weapon system, modification, support equipment, etc.)
   from the procurement account which funds production of the end item. The phrase ―items in
   production‖ means the end item in production is funded in the year the production
   engineering is to take place. Because weapon system development and production
   engineering often overlap, you must properly categorize development and production tasks.
   In general, development engineering tries to achieve or improve system performance;
   production engineering tries to correct deficiencies in the approved production baseline.
   Ultimately, you must apply this guidance case by case.
   8.4.3. Maintenance Engineering. Use the Operation and Maintenance appropriation which
   funds the operational support of the system or equipment.
       8.4.3.1. Maintenance engineering efforts may result in the need to redesign a product or
       substantially improve its performance (flight characteristics, mission performance
       parameters, reliability, capacity, etc.). The redesign would be a development engineering
       task because it improves system performance.
       8.4.3.2. You must carefully categorize production and maintenance tasks, which often
       overlap. In general, production engineering tries to correct deficiencies in a production
       baseline; maintenance engineering tries to identify deficiencies discovered in
       postproduction operational service. You will need to decide case by case.
8.5. Exceptions:
   8.5.1. Use RDT&E to fund all efforts to improve engine components (a combination of
   maintenance and development engineering) per Congressional direction (see Chapter 13).
   8.5.2. Use DWCF to fund development, production, and maintenance engineering services
   that support an operational commodity item managed by the DWCF Supply Business Area.
   But don’t use the DWCF if the engineering effort results from a weapon system production
   or modification improvement. For example, charge the cost of the engineering effort to the
   DWCF if the commodity manager needs to reverse engineer the item to improve
   supportability or determine cause(s) of reported problems, or wants to improve the reliability
   or maintainability of the item itself. If engineering is necessary to do an improved
   configuration change, charge the engineering cost to the procurement account that bears the
   cost of the configuration change.
8.6. Modification Engineering. See Section 8G of this chapter.

Section 8B—Aircraft (57*3010)

8.7. Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). To fund ASIP tasks for:
   8.7.1. Aircraft in Development, charge to RDT&E (57*3600).
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              165


   8.7.2. Aircraft in Production, charge to aircraft procurement if the engineering tries to ensure
   the aircraft performs or endures up to the specifications in the performance envelope. Aircraft
   procurement funds are also appropriate if the engineering tries to extend the aircraft’s useful
   military life within the performance envelope. Use RDT&E for the ASIP if engineering
   intends to push the system outside the performance envelope.
   8.7.3. Aircraft Out of Production, charge to O&M. But use RDT&E if the engineering
   intends to push the aircraft’s performance outside the envelope.
8.8. Retrofitting or Converting Aircraft:
   8.8.1. For retrofitting or converting test aircraft procured for test purposes to tactically
   configured aircraft.
       8.8.1.1. Charge the cost to the aircraft procurement appropriation (weapon system
       program-BPAC 10XXXX) if the model design and series (MDS) aircraft is being
       produced in the program year during which the retrofit or conversion is directed.
       8.8.1.2. Charge the cost to the aircraft procurement appropriation (modification program-
       BPAC 110000) if the MDS aircraft directed for reconfiguration is not in production and
       the reconfiguration is not in production.
   8.8.2. When aircraft are accepted into the Air Force inventory with deviations from the
   procurement contract requirements and corrections are necessary:
       8.8.2.1. Charge the costs of the corrections to BPAC 10XXXX funds cited on the
       procurement contract if the correction is to be accomplished before acceptance of the
       final item procured under the program contracting increment.
       8.8.2.2. Charge the cost to the modification program (BPAC 110000) if the corrections
       are made after the Air Force accepts the last item (aircraft) procured under that contract
       program increment.
   8.8.3. Use this guidance for aircraft accepted into the Air Force inventory with equipment
   installed as a substitute by amendment to the procurement contract. When the original
   specified item becomes available and is to be installed in the delivered aircraft to replace the
   substituted item, charge the cost of the retrofit or modification to the modification program.
   8.8.4. Use RDT&E to fund the cost of changing aircraft back to the original configuration,
   including hardware and labor, if the aircraft are for testing in research and development
   (R&D) programs.
8.9. Modifying Aircraft to Drone Configuration. Handle funding as follows for modifying an
aircraft to a drone configuration, modifying spare parts, directly supporting common support
equipment, and follow-on support after reconfiguration:
   8.9.1. Charge the 57*3600 appropriation for the cost of modifying aircraft to a drone
   configuration required solely for R&D. Charge the same appropriation for changes to spare
   components or direct support ground handling equipment, if these result from the aircraft
   modification.
   8.9.2. Charge the 57*3010 appropriation, BPAC 110000 or the Material Support Division
   (MSD) of the Defense Working Capital Fund for the cost of modifying aircraft to a standard
 166                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   drone configuration for general purposes (including training, operations or R&D). Include
   changes to spare parts or ground handling equipment that directly support the modification.
   8.9.3. Charge the 57*3010 appropriation, BPAC 120000 or the Materiel Support Division
   (MSD) of the DWCF for common follow-on support of aircraft converted to a drone
   configuration, after the modification under paragraph 8.7 above.
   8.9.4. Charge the 57*3600 appropriation for peculiar support if drone vehicles are used in
   R&D programs.

Section 8C—Weapons (57*3020)

8.10. Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Force. Air Force Space Command (AFSPC)
modernizes, integrates, and updates ICBM launch and launch control facilities while they are in
the acquisition phase, or after they return to the acquisition phase. AFSPC will normally budget
and fund for such changes based on the concept of procuring the total package, to include the
hardware, necessary installation, and other support costs. The assembly and checkout contractor
pays installation and support (except for hardware procurement). But program managers may
contract for selected tasks from separate contractors to work operational schedules or gain an
advantage for the government. In this case, charge the contracts to the weapons procurement
account.
8.11. Missile Site Updating. Charge changes to hardware and equipment in an update program
to the same appropriation that financed installing the equipment or hardware.
8.12. Logistic Support of Fixed Installed Missile Support Equipment. The weapons system
activation contractor’s Air Force ―H‖ accounts at each site support supply for installation and
check, assembly and check out, and U.S. Strategic Command’s operational requirements until 45
days after the final site acceptance. AFSPC will budget and fund to support investment items
during all three of these periods. After that, AFSPC is responsible for all centrally procured
investment items, and operating commands include in their budget estimates all requirements
coded for base procurement.
8.13. Missile Modification or Reconfiguration. Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) will
charge 57*3020, BP 2100 to modify or reconfigure a missile no longer in production if the
missile will meet a mission requirement other than that for which the last missile was first
procured. If modifying or reconfiguring the missile places it into an acquisition phase, AFMC
will program and budget for the modification. If a missile modified for space booster requires
removal of unnecessary hardware for reliability, the using organization will pay the costs.
8.14. Missile Propellants. Charge the missile procurement appropriation for the cost of solid
missile propellants used in producing or initially loading production missiles at the contractor’s
plant during system acquisition and at the launch site during launch operations. Charge the same
appropriation to replace outdated propellants. Pay for liquid or gaseous propellants with O&M
funds.

Section 8D—Investment Equipment (57*3080)

8.15. Investment Equipment for Major Range and Test Facilities. Finance this equipment
from the Other Procurement appropriation (57*3080) (reference DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 11A,
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             167


Chapter 12, DoDD 3200.11; and Chapter 7 of this instruction). EXCEPTION: Use RDT&E
(57*3600) to purchase equipment that mainly supports DT&E or IOT&E. This exception applies
even though the equipment may subsequently be used for other than DT&E or IOT&E.
8.16. Base Procured Investment Equipment (BPIE):
   8.16.1. Use appropriation 57*3080 (BPAC 84XXXX) to fund annual requirements for base-
   level procurement of authorized investment equipment items if these items exceed $250,000
   in cost and aren’t available through Air Force central procurement. Use the same
   appropriation for authorized related costs. If you’re a host installation, include tenant
   requirements in your annual programs (see paragraph 7.7 for guidance and exception).
   8.16.2. Although appropriation 57*3080 funds are available by law for obligation for 3
   years, the Air Force finances the program requirements of the year for which the funds are
   appropriated. Therefore, MAJCOMs and installations should:
       8.16.2.1. Treat BPAC 84501X (base procured equipment) as an annual program.
       8.16.2.2. Fully commit this program by the end of the first fiscal year (FY).
       8.16.2.3. Obligate it no later than 3 months after the end of the first FY.
       8.16.2.4. Defer equipment requirements identified too late to be on contract within the 15
       months to a later FY for funding. If you have questions, ask SAF/FMBIX or HQ
       USAF/ILPR.
   8.16.3. Local Purchase of Centrally Procured Equipment Items. Local purchase of
   centrally managed items budgeted in the procurement accounts (3010, 3011, 3020, 3080
   procurement appropriations) with 3400 (O&M) funds is prohibited. Centrally managed items
   are budgeted by the Air Force and appropriated by Congress in the procurement
   appropriations. Units can be provided Air Force authorization to locally procure most items
   with item manager approval, however, procurement funds provided by the Inventory
   Manager (IM) must be used.
   8.16.4. There may be cases where an item that is coded for central procurement and
   management should more appropriately be coded for local procurement. If a unit deems an
   equipment item to be inappropriately coded, they may request recoding action through the
   AF Form 86, Request for Cataloging Data/Action, process as detailed in AFMAN 23-110,
   Vol. I, Para two, Paragraph 6c(2).
   8.16.5. Standard Warranty. A standard warranty offered by a contractor on equipment is
   properly funded as part of the procurement. The standard warranty constitutes a bona fide
   need of the procurement. If the standard warranty of a vendor is 3 years and it is included in
   the price of the equipment, then it is funded in procurement. However, extended warranties
   added on as additional costs to the contract are not an integral part of the procurement of the
   equipment, do not constitute a bona fide need of the contract, and are to be treated as options
   to the standard warranty and funded with O&M in the option years.
8.17. Finance the Following Items with 57*3080, BPAC 84501X Funds: (Unless equipment
is being replaced as part of an O&M-type fund repair project) (See paragraph 8.2 for changes to
the 3080 BP 8400 program due to stock funding of Depot Level Reparables.)
 168                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   8.17.1. Investment equipment items with a source of supply from General Services
   Administration, Defense Logistics Agency, other services, or local purchase (including
   replacement Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE)).
   8.17.2. Non-stock-listed investment equipment items that are locally procured that are not
   part of a construction project (57*3300), O&M-funded construction (EEIC 529), O&M-
   funded repair (EEIC 522) (either in-house or by contract), or a stand-alone facility
   RPIE replacement if the unit cost is in excess of $250,000.
   8.17.3. Installation costs of investment items dictated by technical considerations or
   warranty conditions, or if installation charges are included in the cost of equipment offered

      8.19.2.4. Exterior and common utilities and associated support items.

Section 8E—Real Property Installed Equipment

8.20. Procuring Real Property Installed Equipment and Portable Equipment:
   8.20.1. Use procedures in this paragraph to fund initial real property installed equipment
   (RPIE) procured and installed as part of a construction project (in-house Base Civil Engineer
   (BCE) or contract). Charge the costs to the appropriation financing the construction project
   (either 57*3300 or O&M-type funds--EEIC 529, depending on the cost).
      8.20.1.1. If the RPIE meets normal investment funding criteria, you may procure it
      through local purchase by directly citing the funds being used to finance the construction
      project.
      8.20.1.2. If the RPIE is stocklisted in Air Force stocklist publications and requisitioned
      from AFMC through normal equipment channels, you must reimburse the appropriation
      which initially financed funded project costs from the appropriation financing the
      construction. For investment items requisitioned from AFMC in minor construction
      projects, reimburse only the items identified in the civil engineer’s cost accounting
      system.
      8.20.1.3. If the RPIE meets normal expense criteria, the installation must procure it
      through the WCF unless a contractor furnishes it. Use the appropriation financing the
      construction project to reimburse the DWCF.
170                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


  8.20.2. Replacement RPIE. If the item/equipment being replaced is integral to the facility
  and would have been funded by MILCON when the facility was constructed, the repair or
  replacement of the item/equipment should be funded with operation and maintenance (O&M)
  funds per 10 U.S.C. 2811 (OSD/GC July 15, 2003). This is applicable whether the
  item/equipment is being replaced as part of a larger repair project or as a stand-alone
  replacement project in the facility. If the item would initially have been funded with
  procurement funds (e.g., production or moveable equipment), then its replacement will be
  funded with procurement funds.
  8.20.3. All air-conditioning equipment, including window units located in real property, is
  classified RPIE. Generally, you would fund it according to procedures in 8.20.1 and 8.20.2
  above. But, do not apply RPIE funding procedures if the air-conditioning is installed in or on
  other than real property. For example, air-conditioning installed in or on a van-mounted piece
  of communications or electronics equipment is not real property. Finance this type of air-
  conditioning installation in personal property, based on normal investment or expense
  criteria.
  8.20.4. Fire-protection systems, excluding self-contained vehicle and portable systems and
  hand extinguishers, are RPIE; therefore, you fund them according to 8.20.1 and 8.20.2 above.
  8.20.5. See AFI 32-1063 for guidance on programming and budgeting for replacement RPIE
  generators. Don’t use the procedures in paragraph 8.20.2 through 8.20.4.
  8.20.6. Use 57*3080 for initial and replacement requirements for all ground mobile (skid,
  wheel mounted, or portable) electric power generators, .5 to 200 KW, not designated as
  RPIE. These generators are centrally managed items.
  8.20.7. AFMC finances initial and replacement requirements for portable equipment
  required to operate a facility (excluding items designated for base procurement) from the
  57*3080 appropriation. Portable equipment includes such items as tooling, materiel handling
  equipment, etc.
  8.20.8. Don’t apply RPIE procedures to fund aircraft arresting systems (runway barriers),
  equipment for static uninterruptible power supply, systems that provide fire protection only
  to non-RPIE or nonreal property, and demountable sound suppressers. These items are
  nonreal property. Instead, follow this guidance:
      8.20.8.1. Aircraft Arresting Systems:
         8.20.8.1.1. Use 57*3080 for anchor chains, cables, drums, nets, erecting
         mechanisms, and the control devices associated with them (these are classed as
         common support equipment).
         8.20.8.1.2. Use military construction funds for the concrete foundations, or pits, and
         the connecting utilities (they are real property).
         8.20.8.1.3. Use 57*3080 for installation of the system if the prime contractor installs
         it as part of the total contract cost.
         8.20.8.1.4. Use O&M-type funds (EEIC 592, miscellaneous contractual services) for
         the installation when contractual labor other than the prime contractor is required to
         install the system. For organic labor, use EEIC 397 to record these costs. This labor is
         not a construction cost.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            171


       8.20.8.2. Power Conditioning and Continuation Interfacing Equipment (PCCIE):
           8.20.8.2.1. Use Other Procurement (57*3080) for the equipment.
           8.20.8.2.2. Use military construction for permanent pads or foundations (real
           property) and connecting utilities.
           8.20.8.2.3. Follow aircraft arresting systems procedures in paragraph 8.20.8.1 for
           installation charges.
       8.20.8.3. Fire Protection Systems. For self-contained vehicle and portable systems,
       including hand extinguishers and systems for the protection of non-RPIE or nonreal
       property:
           8.20.8.3.1. Use the major procurement appropriations for centrally procured
           equipment.
           8.20.8.3.2. Use the appropriation financing the systems acquisition if the centrally
           procured equipment is airborne equipment peculiar to one weapon system.
           8.20.8.3.3. Use 57*3080 funds if the centrally procured airborne equipment is
           common to more than one weapon system, or is purely ground equipment.
           8.20.8.3.4. Use 57*3080 funds for base-procured equipment with a unit cost in
           excess of $250,000.
           8.20.8.3.5. Use O&M for base-procured equipment with a unit cost $250,000 or less.
       8.20.8.4. Demountable Sound Suppression Equipment (“Hush House”) for Ground
       Test of Aircraft and Engines:
           8.20.8.4.1. Use the major procurement appropriations for demountable equipment
           that suppresses sound on power check pads and jet engine test stands (they are classed
           as common support equipment).
           8.20.8.4.2. Use appropriation 57*3010 BP1000 when the equipment is common to
           more than one weapon system or peculiar to one weapon system which is still in
           production.
           8.20.8.4.3. Use 57*3010 BP 1200 when the equipment is common to more than one
           weapon system or peculiar to one weapon system that is no longer in production.
           8.20.8.4.4. Use the major procurement appropriations for installation if the prime
           contractor installs the equipment as part of the total contract cost.
           8.20.8.4.5. Use O&M funds for installation by anyone other than the prime
           contractor.
           8.20.8.4.6. Use construction for permanent pads or foundations (real property) and
           connecting utilities.
8.21. Procuring and Installing Communications-Electronic Systems. This paragraph
explains when to use procurement and military construction appropriations for fixed, mobile, and
transportable communications-electronic (C-E) systems.
   8.21.1. Use the Other Procurement appropriation (57*3080) for the following direct costs
   when procurement is on a turnkey basis (single prime contractor) (See paragraph 8.19.1):
 172                                                 AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       8.21.1.1. Procuring, installing, testing, and checking out of C-E systems equipment and
       associated gear, including antennas and antenna towers.
       8.21.1.2. Procuring and erecting of equipment shelters used solely for shelters.
       8.21.1.3. Engineering and design associated with the above items.
   8.21.2. Use the Other Procurement appropriation (57*3080) for the following C-E system
   items, if (1) they are incidental but integral to procuring and installing of C-E systems and
   have no other purposes and (2) they are an integral part of the prime contract (even if a
   subcontractor installs them). (NOTE: Use O&M funds, EEIC 592, if a contractor other than
   the prime contractor (or direct subcontractor) installs the system or modifies it as a result of
   state-of-art changes.)
       8.21.2.1. Foundations for equipment, self-contained equipment shelters, prefabricated
       buildings used solely for equipment shelters, antennas, and antenna towers.
       8.21.2.2. Temporary or permanent utilities required solely to operate C-E equipment.
       8.21.2.3. Unpaved access roads and walks needed for a contractor to access areas in
       order to install or erect equipment.
       8.21.2.4. Procuring and installing security fencing needed to protect areas or equipment
       during contractor operations.
       8.21.2.5. Engineering and design costs associated with the above items.
   8.21.3. Use construction funds (MILCON or O&M) for:
       8.21.3.1. Facilities for administration, logistics, housing, and other activities to support a
       C-E system.
       8.21.3.2. All other masonry buildings not used to house equipment only.
       8.21.3.3. All paved roads and walks as well as other access roads and walks not directly
       related to contractor requirements or not required solely to access equipment.
       8.21.3.4. Common-use temporary and permanent utilities required to support a C-E
       system site.
       8.21.3.5. Other items of construction not covered above.
       8.21.3.6. Engineering and design associated with the above items.
   8.21.4. Use Other Procurement, Air Force (57*3080) or O&M to fund other requirements for
   fixed C-E facilities and equipment, such as modernizing, upgrading, expanding, or
   augmenting them.
   8.21.5. Procure Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) according to the expense/investment
   criteria. DWCF requirements are funded with DWCF.
8.22. Equipment (Other than Communications Systems) Procured on an Installed Basis
(e.g., Radar, Navigational Aids (NAVAIDS), and Crytographic Equipment).
   8.22.1. Use 57*3080 to procure equipment required for fixed facilities on an installed basis
   if dictated by technical considerations, warranty conditions, or if the cost of equipment
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             173


   offered for public sale includes installation charges. Charge procuring equipment on an
   installed basis to the program year in which it was directed.
   8.22.2. Installation includes unpacking, assembling components, placement, and connecting
   necessary utilities in a space previously prepared for the operation of the equipment. (NOTE:
   Do not include renovation or rearrangement of buildings or utility systems, construction
   foundations, strengthening floors or roofs, or excavation in your installation costs. These are
   base civil engineer (BCE) activities whether accomplished in-house or by separate contract,
   and you should finance them using the base’s or command’s normal funding procedures.)
   8.22.3. When you must construct, modify, alter, or rehabilitate buildings to install
   equipment, submit the requirement through MAJCOM channels for HQ USAF approval as a
   corollary to the equipment procurement. Charge these costs to the military construction
   program (MCP), O&M, or RDT&E appropriations, as appropriate.
   8.22.4. If specifically approved by HQ USAF, AFMC or Air Intelligence Agency (AIA) may
   procure equipment financed from the 57*3080 appropriation and required for a fixed
   operation on a system or a packaged basis.
      8.22.4.1. Under the system approach, the equipment procurement contract includes one
      or more pieces of equipment, components, installation material, and engineering and
      installation charges. Use the 57*3080 appropriation.
      8.22.4.2. Under the packaged approach, use the 57*3080 appropriation to finance the
      system and the necessary directly related construction under one contract (see paragraph
      8.19 and 8.21).
   8.22.5. Procure computer-raised flooring for new production flight simulators as part of the
   simulator complex using the ―package procurement‖ approach. Include the costs to acquire
   and install this flooring in the procurement specification packages for all new production
   flight simulators using Aircraft Procurement, Air Force (57*3010) funds. This is an
   exception to Chapter 4 (Figure 4.1).

Section 8F—Production Activities

8.23. Government-Furnished Expense Items to Production Contractors:
   8.23.1. Use the appropriate procurement appropriation to reimburse the DWCF for expense
   items furnished to production contractors in order to incorporate them into the manufacture
   or assembly of an investment item. Reimburse from the budget program that finances
   procurement of the investment item.
   8.23.2. These expense items also include DWCF fuel consumed during production
   qualification and acceptance testing (predelivery) of aircraft and related fuel-consuming
   equipment. Charge the fuel to 57*3010, BP1000 account, on a current year basis; for
   example, you pay for FY 1998 fuel issues with FY 1998 3010 funds. This does not include
   fuel furnished for aircraft delivery from the contractor’s plant to the military activity. Such
   delivery is first destination transportation (FDT); you fund it per Chapter 10.
8.24. Pilot Production. Use RDT&E funds for development or preproduction prototypes used
for DT&E and IOT&E.
 174                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   8.24.1. If the testing activity uses the prototypes for IOT&E, they must represent the
   expected production items well enough to get a valid estimate of the item’s operational
   effectiveness and suitability. If acquiring a limited number of special pilot items from a pilot
   line is necessary to provide the needed representatives, use RDT&E to finance establishing
   the initial pilot line and for the IOT&E items. Prototypes produced with RDT&E funds must
   be adequate in number to fulfill both DT&E and IOT&E requirements.
   8.24.2. Charge a procurement appropriation for all subsequent costs to retain the initial pilot
   line capability for follow-on operational test and evaluation (FOT&E), as well as inventory.
   8.24.3. Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP). For discussion of LRIP funding in
   Procurement and RDT&E, see DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 2A, chapter 1, paragraph 010212.
8.25. Costs for Closing Down a Production Line. MAJCOMs, installations and program
offices fund closing down a production line from the last production buy for Air Force
requirements (BPAC 100000, 200000 etc.). Use BP1300 (Post Production Support) for
closedown costs if the last production aircraft has been delivered. If additional costs are incurred
to keep the line open for non-Air Force requirements (for example, foreign military sales
(FMS)), prorate and include the cost in the sales price of the item to non-Air Force customers.
   8.25.1. Charge the BPAC for industrial responsiveness/facilities (BPAC 140000, 240000,
   etc.) to remove and prepare machinery and equipment for shipment to reserve storage or to
   the Air Force contractor.
   8.25.2. Charge the O&M funds of the requesting base or depot for packing, crating, handling
   and transportation, as well as storage, of production tooling they request to satisfy their
   future maintenance requirements. These costs aren’t integral to normal closedown. Charge
   transportation to the transportation (SDT) account of the requesting base’s or depot’s Major
   Command.

Section 8G—Guidance for Funding Maintenance and Modification

8.26. Financing Maintenance and Modifications:
   8.26.1. Use O&M for maintenance (labor, expense materials, DLR).
   8.26.2. Use RDT&E for:
       8.26.2.1. Development engineering for modifications.
       8.26.2.2. Engineering required to integrate and test commercially available end items
       (including ADP equipment and software), for which the overall configuration is not
       commercially available.
   8.26.3. Use the procurement appropriations for modification engineering and engineering
   changes except as stated in the following paragraphs of this section.
   8.26.4. Use the procurement appropriations to buy and install modification kits. Procurement
   will normally not begin until a modification has a configuration baseline which is fully
   qualified and operational. Expense and investment material items required to install
   modification kits are normally included in the Group A and B kits; charge them to the
   procurement appropriations under the total kit policy. With rare exception, you will budget
   and fund an equal number of Group A and Group B kits in the same fiscal year. The
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              175


  exception is when an equal number is not required to accomplish the mission - ―part time‖
  Group B kits rotated to Group A kits installed in several different aircraft. Funds to install
  modification kits will be budgeted in the fiscal year in which the installation is to be
  accomplished (FY 1994 Appropriations Conference Report # 103-339). On occasion,
  Congress may add funds for a modification and include the installation funds in the same
  year as the kits. In such instances, the program will be executed as directed by Congress.
  Also use the procurement appropriations (modification programs) for:
     8.26.4.1. Installation engineering data, technical data, and special tools required to install
     mod kits.
     8.26.4.2. Buying support equipment and peculiar test equipment required to support the
     modified configuration item(s) as a direct result of the modification program.
     8.26.4.3. Modifying spare components or support equipment when modification
     programs directly require it.
     8.26.4.4. If a modification is being done in conjunction with a Programmed Depot
     Maintenance (PDM), the modification will pay for the installation and materiel costs that
     are over and above those required for the PDM. The PDM will pay for common tasks or
     immaterial costs that are not cost effective to separate.
     8.26.4.5. Modification Prohibition, Exception, and Waiver. The FY 1998
     Appropriations Act (P.L. 105-56) states, ―None of the funds in this Act and hereafter
     shall be available for use by a military department to modify an aircraft, weapon, ship, or
     other item of equipment, that the military department concerned plans to retire or
     otherwise dispose of within 5 years after the completion of the modification.‖ The word
     ―hereafter‖makes this permanent law. There is an exception and a waiver option
     available: (1) it does not apply to safety modifications, and (2) may be waived by ―the
     Secretary of a military department if the Secretary determines it is in the best national
     security interest of the United States to provide such a waiver and so notifies the
     congressional defense committees in writing.‖
  8.26.5. Use O&M funds for expense materials that are not part of a mod kit, but are
  determined to require replacement during inspection and modification.
  8.26.6. Charge installation to RDT&E if the modification supports an RDT&E effort or
  project, or if an RDT&E funded organization owns the equipment being modified.
  Otherwise, charge the installation to the procurement accounts. (NOTE: The use of
  procurement funds for installation costs became effective in FY 1991 (except for Other
  Procurement, which was FY 1992)).
  8.26.7. Use the procedures in paragraph 8.26.1 through 8.26.5 to correct deficiencies in an
  end item of equipment in production except as follows. Some production contracts include a
  clause providing for a contractor to take all actions necessary to correct deficiencies in
  equipment revealed during production. The contractor must do so for a specified time with
  no change in contract target cost or ceiling. In this case, charge procuring and installing of
  kits for the modifications to the appropriation used to buy the equipment end item. (For
  example, procuring and installing deficiency or compatibility update mod kits for aircraft in
  production would be chargeable to the applicable weapon system budget program (BPAC) of
  the Aircraft Procurement Appropriation.) If the mod kits needed to correct the deficiency are
176                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


  no longer covered by the terms of the contract, fund them according to the preceding
  paragraphs.
  8.26.8. Use the following guidance for ―P‖ (permanent) and ―P-S‖ (permanent-safety)
  modifications:
      8.26.8.1. Charge the trial installation work to the procurement appropriations. It is
      considered modification engineering. (Modification engineering, including engineering
      of Group A hardware (and associated software) and mod kit installation instructions,
      normally occurs during trial installation of a qualified, first-production Group B kit. The
      trial installation results in the first-production configuration item.) Also, use procurement
      appropriations to pay for fuel used in predelivery test of a trial installation.
      8.26.8.2. Use the procurement appropriations to fund engineering efforts (modification
      engineering) to make minor changes to a fully developed and qualified modification kit
      (either hardware or software) in order to adapt it for modifying another end item or
      system. An example would be an aircraft system of another MDS. ―Minor engineering
      effort‖ requires less than 25 percent of the engineering manhours involved in developing
      the initial or previous operation’s configuration baseline (hardware and software).
  8.26.9. For Engineering Change Proposals/Engineering Change Orders (ECPs/ECO):
      8.26.9.1. When conducting engineering studies to determine if an ECP/ECO should
      proceed to the modification production phase:
         8.26.9.1.1. Use O&M (3400) if the program is a reliability/maintainability effort,
         8.26.9.1.2. Use R&D (3600) if the program requires development efforts.
         8.26.9.1.3. Don’t use modification production funds to make this determination.
      8.26.9.2. When an ECP/ECO generates after an item is on contract:
         8.26.9.2.1. Use funds that financed the production item on the contract to finance the
         ECP/ ECO; i.e., if 3600 paid for a development item, then 3600 pays for the change
         order; if 3010 paid for a production item, then 3010 pays for the change proposal.
         8.26.9.2.2. Don’t use procurement funds to procure engineering contract services in
         order to review an ECP/ECO for sufficiency.
  8.26.10. Charge the budget program funding the equipment end item for modification
  engineering for mod kits to be installed on equipment end items in production. Use
  modification program funds only for ―difference engineering‖ required to install the mod kits
  on equipment end items already produced. (―Difference engineering‖ is the additional
  engineering needed to cover the different installation requirements (hardware and software)
  between in-production items and those already procured.)
  8.26.11. Suppose modifying a weapon system requires modifying a training device (for
  example, a simulator) which supports the weapon system. In this case, use the same funding
  (such as RDT&E) for designing and modifying the system and the training device (RDT&E).
  If modifications of the training device don’t stem from modifying the weapon system, fund
  engineering efforts in the same manner as other end item modifications (see previous
  paragraphs). The guidance in, Chapter 4, Section 4B applies to designing and developing
  training devices, and software changes not associated with hardware modifications.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             177


8.27. Determining Proper Fiscal Year. A modification is valid for funding in the year the
requirement is formally documented in the HQ USAF requirement validation process, or
thereafter. Normally this date is as follows:
   8.27.1. To correct a deficiency in production mods -- the year the deficiency is identified in
   an official test report per AFI 99-101, or in a deficiency report per T0-00-35D-54. Don’t fund
   the retrofit before the mod goes in to the production line.
   8.27.2. For safety, reliability and maintainability mods -- the year the deficiency report is
   received per T0-00-35D-54, or the material improvement project is established.
   8.27.3. For new/improved operational capability mods -- the year the statement of need
   (SON) is validated per AFI 10-601. SAF/FMB may make exceptions to the above criteria
   when other acceptable documentation clearly establishes official recognition of the
   requirements.

Section 8H—Value Analysis and Engineering

8.28. Value Analysis of Spare Parts:
   8.28.1. Use the guidance in Table 8.1 to determine the source of funding for value analysis
   of spare parts: (NOTE: value analysis is a detailed and exhaustive pricing investigation to
   determine the likely competitive price or market price of spare parts.)

Table 8.1. Appropriations to Charge for Value Analysis of Spare Parts.

If the Principal Benefiting Program Is In       Charge the Contractual Costs To
Aircraft Procurement (3010)                     Budget Programs (BP) 16 or BP 19, as appropriate
Missile Procurement (3020)                      BP 25, 26 or the RSD, DWCF, as appropriate; or BP
                                                29 if neither 25, 26 nor the RSD is the benefiting
                                                program
Other Procurement (3080)                        BP 8600
Operation and Maintenance (3400)                appropriate MAJCOM budget activity, citing EEIC
                                                592
Two or more appropriations                      a value analysis contract that contains a separate line
                                                item for each benefiting appropriation and the cost
                                                of the contract pro-rated accordingly
   8.28.2. Charge in-house value analysis, without a contract, to the normal O&M-type funds
   of the activity doing the analysis.
8.29. Guidance for Funding Value Engineering (VE). MAJCOMs, installations and program
managers should include the amounts required to pay for Value Engineering Proposals (VEP),
Value Engineering Change Proposals (VECP), testing, and other costs arising from the VE
program in all budget estimates.
   8.29.1. Charge the cost arising from VE actions to the appropriation financing the prime
   benefiting program, except as specified below.
 178                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   8.29.2. Use RDT&E to fund VE (internal or contractor) performed during design and
   development.
   8.29.3. Pay for VE performed according to either a program requirements clause or an
   incentive clause on major end items in production or in the operational inventory (such as
   weapons, military equipment, and components as well as minor items) as follows: (1) charge
   the VE cost to RDT&E if the VE requires redesign that entails related development, test, and
   evaluation work which increases the performance envelope, and (2) charge the account
   financing the prime benefiting program for VE actions other than those in the preceding
   subparagraph.
   8.29.4. Finance VE by a contractor under a value engineering requirements clause as a
   separate line item in the contract and from the same appropriation cited in the contract.
8.30. Sharing VE Incentive and Program Requirement Clauses:
   8.30.1. Financing Instant Contract:
       8.30.1.1. Contractors share in the cost savings on contracts if they propose a VE change
       that the Air Force accepts. Sharing is limited to the instant contract and the quantity of
       the item procured under the contract. To compensate the contractor, the Air Force
       reduces the contract price only by its share of savings and includes in the contract price
       the contractor’s share of the savings.
       8.30.1.2. Use the appropriation cited in the instant contract to finance the contractor’s
       share of the savings because this share is included as a part of the payment to the
       contractor at the reduced contract price.
          8.30.1.2.1. Prorate the savings in the same proportion as the quantity procured for the
          different appropriations when the instant contract includes more than one fund
          citation.
          8.30.1.2.2. Prorate the savings based on the quantities procured when the instant
          contract includes a fund citation that results from a consolidated order from two or
          more customers.
   8.30.2. Financing Lump Sum Payments on Future Acquisition Savings:
       8.30.2.1. If the Air Force buys more of the same item with the VE change incorporated,
       the contractor may also be paid a share of the VE savings in the added items. Determine
       the contractor’s share per unit as you did under the instant contract. This share per unit
       extends to the estimated number of units to be procured later. The provision in the instant
       contract that authorizes the lump sum payment on future acquisition savings specifies this
       number. The Air Force compensates the contractor by a lump sum, one-time payment
       under the instant contract.
       8.30.2.2. Air Force users may initially charge the contractor’s share of the savings to the
       appropriation cited in the instant contract and, when determined appropriate, transfer
       these amounts to the applicable account using the funding principles in paragraph 8.29
       above. Before accepting the VECP, you must determine that funds are available in the
       account that will ultimately bear the charge.
   8.30.3. Financing Royalty Payments on Future Acquisition Savings:
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             179


     8.30.3.1. In addition to sharing savings under the instant contract (but always in lieu of
     any sharing by lump sum payments), the Air Force may agree in the contract to pay the
     contractor a ―royalty.‖ (The royalty payment is based on actual future procurements,
     within a stated time period, of the same item that incorporate the instant VE change.)
     Also, the Air Force may agree in the instant contract to pay the contractor a ―royalty‖ on
     future overhaul and maintenance work by an ―in-house‖ defense facility that uses the
     instant VE changes. Agreement in the instant contract to pay royalties based on actual
     future procurement doesn’t commit or obligate funds. Also, the agreement to pay
     royalties doesn’t extend either to procurements of the item by any other DoD component
     (even though the instant VE change is incorporated in such procurements) or overhaul
     and maintenance work.
     8.30.3.2. Generally, you should determine the contractor’s share per unit as you do for
     lump sum payments. The Air Force pays contractors under the future contract in
     reasonable increments of not more than 6 months. The payments depend on quantities
     purchased, or in-house work done, in which they hold a contractual right to share in the
     savings.
     8.30.3.3. Charge the contractor’s share of savings under the royalty method to the
     appropriation account cited in the subsequent procurement or construction contract,
     regardless of whether that contract is with the instant contractor. For overhaul and
     maintenance work in a defense facility, pay the contractor’s share of savings either
     directly from the customer appropriation financing the order or from the fund financing
     the defense facility. You may pay this share whether the defense facility is operated as a
     DWCF or other fund activity.
     8.30.3.4. When the Air Force later buys for another DoD component under a MIPR,
     include royalty payment amounts in your funding citation for the procurement or
     construction. If the responsibility for procurement or construction transfers to another
     DoD component under logistical transfer procedures, the Air Force transfers
     responsibility for making royalty payments to the gaining component, and that
     component must accept this responsibility.
  8.30.4. Financing Payments for Collateral Savings:
     8.30.4.1. As a result of accepting a VE change under the instant contract, the Air Force
     may compensate the contractor for a share in collateral savings expected from the change.
     Examples of these savings would be fewer requirements for government-furnished
     property, reduced cost of operating the contract item, or lower costs for logistical support.
     This compensation is always a onetime lump sum payment under the instant contract.
     Don’t pay collateral savings for any subsequent purchases of the same item by the Air
     Force or any other DoD component.
     8.30.4.2. Initially, you may charge the lump-sum payment for collateral savings to the
     appropriation cited in the instant contract and, after determining the proper allocation,
     transfer these amounts to the proper account under 8.29 above. Before accepting the
     VECP, you must determine that funds are available in the account that will ultimately
     bear the charge.
 180                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   8.30.5. VE Program Requirements Clause. This clause requires a stated level of VE effort
   by the contractor and is a separate contract line item. Fund according to the guidance in
   paragraph 8.29.
   8.30.6. Testing. The Air Force must conduct appropriate tests before determining that a
   VEP and VECP are acceptable. Tests are usually required before the contractor accepts the
   proposals. Typically, the Air Force command that benefits from the VEP or VECP tests as
   part of operations. So MAJCOMs must include these costs in their financial plans for O&M-
   type appropriations.
   8.30.7. Unsolicited Proposals. If the Air Force accepts an unsolicited proposal to save
   money from someone other than the contractor, charge for it according to the guidance in
   paragraph 8.29.1 through 8.29.4 The payment to the unsolicited source will be either a lump
   sum or a royalty. An example would be saving money on supplies or services under contract
   or furnished in-house within a Defense facility.

Section 8I—Other Investment Procurement Policies

8.31. Funding Test and Evaluation. See Chapter 14.
8.32. Purchasing Information Processing Equipment (IPE). See Section 4B, Chapter 4.
8.33. Funding the Local Manufacture of Investment Items. Charge the cost for emergency
local manufacture of investment items required by a repair activity to the procurement
appropriation to which the item is identifiable. Installations may not use local manufacture to
stock items for inventory.
8.34. Funding Support Equipment. Determine the budget program activity codes (BPACs)
for peculiar support equipment and common support equipment as follows:
   8.34.1. Initial. For in-production weapon systems, the System Program Director (SPD) is
   responsible for programming, budgeting, and funding all support equipment (SE) required
   for initial lay-in. The SPD will use weapon system procurement funds (3010, BP10; 3020,
   BP20). Note that for the Special Operations Force (SOF) systems, this is an Air Force bill to
   pay in accordance with the 1989 Memorandum of Agreement (Section. II, paragraph 2b(2j)).
   Initial SE includes both common and peculiar SE that support the mission design series (all
   blocks and sub indentures) in-production and its engine which the Air Force acquires for the
   following reasons:
       8.34.1.1. To support deliveries of new principal items (aircraft and missiles),
       8.34.1.2. As a result of basis of issue (BOI) changes during production of the weapon
       system,
       8.34.1.3. To provide additional quantities of support equipment to support force structure
       changes that increase the number of bases requiring SE during the production of the
       weapon system, e.g., conversion from active to Guard/Reserve forces.
   8.34.2. Replacement. For out of production systems, the Item Manager (IM) whether
   resident in the SPD, Product Group Manager, or Material Group Manager office, is
   responsible for budgeting and funding for replacement of organizational and intermediate
   level support equipment, both common and peculiar. MAJCOMs that use the equipment
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             181


   shall program sufficient funding for specific replacement support equipment programs in
   excess of $15 million per year or $50 million total program cost. The IM will use equipment
   procurement funds (3010, BP12; 3020, BP22). Replacement SE is that which the Air force
   acquires for the following reasons:
      8.34.2.1. To replace losses of existing SE, e.g., condemnations,
      8.34.2.2. As part of changeout program where one item of SE will replace another,
      8.34.2.3. As a result of BOI changes that occur during the post production support period
      of the weapon system.
   8.34.3. Appropriation 3010, BP 1300 is used to provide additional quantities of SE to
   support force structure changes that increase the number of bases requiring SE during the
   post production period of the weapon system, e.g., conversion from active to Guard/Reserve
   forces.
   8.34.4. Modification. Use BP 1100 (modifications) for all peculiar SE required because of
   a modification. This includes peculiar SE required to support a system that applies to more
   than one aircraft. Also follow this guidance for changes in modification quantities or items
   during the course of the modification funding.
   8.34.5. See chart in AFMAN 65-604 under 57X3010 Fund code 11, BP 1200, Common
   Support Equipment.
8.35. Funding Technical and Engineering Data. See Chapter 4, Section 4E.
8.36. Training:
   8.36.1. Training Films. The Air Force procures some special training films as part of the
   contract for procuring an end item. Charge the initial supply of a stated number of the films
   to the procurement appropriation and BPAC under which you procure the specific weapons
   system or end item of equipment.
      8.36.1.1. Follow the above guidance for aircraft, missiles, and direct support equipment
      as long as you are procuring the initial squadron equipment by model type. Do not apply
      the guidance to operational tests and follow-on operational tests.
      8.36.1.2. Follow the above guidance for equipment procured under the 57*3080
      appropriation until the last item in the procurement contract is accepted into the inventory
      from the production program.
      8.36.1.3. Sometimes the requirement for special training films results from, and
      procurement is accomplished with, the modification of a weapon system or end item of
      equipment. When this occurs, charge producing a stated number of films to the same
      procurement appropriation and BPAC that covers the modification.
      8.36.1.4. If the requirement for special training films results from maintenance
      operational requirements, technical order changes, etc., charge the cost to O&M-type
      appropriations.
      8.36.1.5. Charge the cost of producing films to O&M-type appropriations if the
      requirement for special training films is: (1) to increase the number available for
      distribution (in addition to the original number authorized for procurement under the
 182                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       procurement appropriation); (2) to replace worn-out film; (3) to produce prints from an
       Air Force negative; or (4) not eligible for procurement under other provisions of this
       paragraph.
   8.36.2. Funding Type 1 Factory Training. See Chapter 10, Section 10L.
8.37. Repairing Government-Furnished Materiel (GFM). Because of malfunction or damage
(in transit or in storage), some GFM items procured for initial installation into a major end item
of equipment in production may have to be returned to the producing GFM contractor or Air
Force depot for repair or rework before they can be installed. Fund the repair of such GFM items
as follows:
   8.37.1. Charge the repair of associated GFM items (including parts or components and
   contract services required) for undelivered end items of equipment (those in contractor’s
   facilities) to the same budget program and program year as the end item of equipment into
   which it will be installed.
   8.37.2. After Air Force acceptance of the end item, charge the repair of GFM components to
   O&M type appropriations. Include those not procured or required for initial installation into
   an in-production end item.
8.38. Industrial Responsiveness/Facilities and Equipment. Aircraft control and warning
(AC&W) and distant early warning (DEW) line sites, whether contractor or government-
operated, are considered command installations, not industrial responsiveness facilities. Compute
modification and maintenance of related equipment according to established Air Force
procedures and fund their costs under either the O&M or Other Procurement appropriations.
8.39. Funding Supplies and Equipment for the National Air and Space Intelligence Center
(NASIC) and the Air Force Technical Application Center (AFTAC):
   8.39.1. Procurement under BPAC 84XXXX for NASIC and AFTAC includes all items of
   centrally procured equipment and supplies normally chargeable to 57*3080 (as described in
   AFMAN 65-604). Use the following subparagraphs to determine fund requirements by
   appropriation for NASIC and AFTAC financial plans and budget estimates.
   8.39.2. Develop requirements for RDT&E (57*3600) using AFMAN 65-604, budget codes.
   8.39.3. Apply the following for procurement appropriation requirements:
       8.39.3.1. Use 57*3010 or the 57*3020 for end items of equipment and systems to be
       initially installed in, and become a part of, an aircraft or missile, and items of an airborne
       nature used in an aircraft or missile used exclusively for NASICD or AFTAC mission
       requirements.
       8.39.3.2. Use 57*3080 for end items of equipment and systems used in ground
       operations exclusively for NASIC or AFTAC mission requirements.
       8.39.3.3. Charge components and maintenance spare parts required to support a
       particular end item of equipment or system to the same appropriation that funded the end
       item (except Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) procured items that are O&M-funded).
       But, if you cannot specifically identify maintenance spare parts, other than DLA items, to
       a single end item of equipment, apply the predominance of use concept. For example,
       when the known or estimated use of a spare part predominates for a particular type of
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                           183


       equipment, charge the total requirement to the same appropriation that funded the
       particular equipment.
   8.39.4. Charge equipment and components required for NASIC and AFTAC operational
   support (including supplies and materiel normally provided for under several 57*3080
   program codes) to BPAC 84XXXX only. In addition, use BPAC 87XXXX to reimburse for
   contractual labor and depot installation or modifications of equipment that are required in
   connection with Permanent Modifications (see AFI 63-1101) of 57*3080 equipment.
   8.39.5. Charge contractual or depot labor (including TDY) required to install 57*3080
   equipment to the applicable O&M appropriation program, unless such equipment is
   authorized for procurement on an installed basis. Charge TDY costs to O&M even for
   procurements on an installed basis. Don’t use BPAC 87XXXX to reimburse 57*3400 for
   contractual or depot labor (including TDY) required to install NASIC and AFTAC
   equipment.
8.40. Production-Related Travel.
   8.40.1. Use RDT&E to fund travel that supports Research, Development, Test, and
   Evaluation efforts and activities.
   8.40.2. Use production funds (see paragraph 8.50 PMA) for travel that directly supports
   production-related activities where you have completed RDT&E or where there was no
   RDT&E.
   8.40.3. Use RDT&E if the travel supports both RDT&E and production-related activities;
   that is, resolve gray areas in favor of RDT&E.
8.41. First Destination Transportation (FDT). Charge FDT for items procured either FOB
Origin or FOB Destination to the procuring appropriations and the program procuring the
equipment/item in that appropriation (3010, 3011, 3020, 3080). Charge the FDT for depot level
reparables to the Materiel Support Division (Defense Working Capital Fund). Charge FDT (FOB
origin) for O&M-funded materiel to the O&M Appropriation. See Chapter 10, Section 10E, for
specific transportation financial guidance.
8.42. General Use Vehicles for Research and Development (R&D) Activities:
   8.42.1. Use Other Procurement (3080) to pay for general use vehicles (defined as common
   equipment used in the day-to-day support of RDT&E base operation and maintenance
   activities).
   8.42.2. Use RDT&E for vehicles required solely for R&D projects, test and evaluation and
   government furnished equipment (GFE) to R&D contractors. This includes vehicles
   authorized specifically to support RDT&E projects, vehicles for targets, vehicles unique to a
   test effort, and vehicles operated by an RDT&E contractor. EXCEPTION: use 57*3080 for
   vehicles required for in-house contractors and base civil engineers responsible for road
   maintenance and debris clearance.
8.43. Buying Back Materiel an FMS Customer Offers for Return. When an AFMC Air
Logistics Center (ALC) learns that an FMS customer offers to return material that satisfies a
valid Air Force requirement for serviceable or unserviceable materiel, it will procure this
materiel as a separate transaction from the original USAF procurement for FMS. Returned
serviceable or unserviceable assets represent a new procurement by the AFMC ALC to meet Air
 184                                             AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


Force operational needs through the buy operating period. Use DWCF obligational authority,
rather than BPs 1500, 2500, 8300, and 8400 for such procurements. When needed, Air Force
customers will buy these items from the DWCF using O&M funds.
8.44. Funding for Reliability Improvement Warranty (RIW). Table 8.2 tells how to fund
RIW included in modification and production contracts and transitioning to either organic or
contractor support upon completing RIW coverage.
   8.44.1. Peculiar support equipment, even when procured late in the acquisition cycle, is (by
   definition) a part of the cost for acquiring the weapon system. Charge it to the weapon
   system line.
   8.44.2. Include RIW costs as part of the unit cost of installed items, although warranty
   coverage is provided for both installed and spare parts.

Table 8.2. Reliability Improvement Warranty (RIW) Funding Support.

NOTE: When a buy of items covered by RIW is for both retrofit and production line
installation, prorate the RIW cost between modification and production funds based on number
of units for each purpose. Also, if you use organic labor for follow-on support, use the same
method to prorate funding for peculiar support equipment related to the split buy.
8.45. Procedures for Replacement and Deposits to the General Fund of the Treasury. See
Volume 2A, Chapter 1, of DoD Regulation 7000.14-R, the DoD Financial Management
Regulation for guidance on replacement, replacement-in-kind, and free assets.
   8.45.1. Replacement Guidance--Weapon Systems or Principal Items:
       8.45.1.1. Replacement in Kind. The program manager must include reimbursement
       from the sale in reimbursable financing and the buyback of the item in the reimbursable
       program. Don’t show this transaction in the direct budget plan. (NOTE: ―Replacement in
       Kind‖ refers to an item sold that requires replacement with an item of the identical type,
       model, and series of ―mod‖ designation. EXAMPLE: Sale of a C-130E aircraft and
       purchase of a C-130E aircraft.
       8.45.1.2. Replacement. Include the reimbursement from the sale under reimbursable
       financing, but show the buy-back of the replacement item under the direct budget plan
       and comply with DoD reprogramming requirements, if applicable. (NOTE:
       ―Replacement‖ refers to an item sold that requires replacement to compensate Air Force
       inventories for the resultant loss of capability or readiness. But, because of
       circumstances, the replacement item will not be identical to the item sold. It must,
       however, be a later series of ―mod‖ designation of the same basic model (for example,
       sale of an F-4D and purchase of an F-4E) or an acceptable substitute item used for the
       same inventory objective or authorized acquisition objective in requirement computations
       (for example, sale of a CBU-58 fuse and purchase of an FMU-81 fuse).)
       8.45.1.3. MAJCOMs that want to replace a principal item with a later series or ―mod‖
       designation, or an acceptable substitute item, must submit a request for financing to
       SAF/FMBI. Include these items, as a minimum, in your request:
 186                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


          8.45.1.3.1. FMS case designation.
          8.45.1.3.2. Item and number sold.
          8.45.1.3.3. Sale price of item (or items) (see also AFI 63-107).
          8.45.1.3.4. Replacement item, number to be procured, cost per item, and total
          required.
          8.45.1.3.5. Inventory and authorized acquisition objective and onhand status; and
          8.45.1.3.6. Date funds are required.
          (NOTE: SAF/FMB will use the above information to prepare appropriate
          reprogramming requests, for submission to OSD and the Congress or inclusion in the
          subsequent year’s budget. SAF/FMB requires at least 120 days to obtain approval of
          reprogramming requests.)
       8.45.1.4. Replacement Guidance--Secondary Items. MAJCOMs may apply proceeds
       from the sale of a secondary item from inventory to buy any required secondary item in
       the same appropriation (for example, resources from sale of a 57*3010 item must be used
       to purchase a 57*3010 item). MAJCOMs must record reimbursable obligations for
       secondary items against specific FMS cases when applicable.
   8.45.2. Deposits to the General Fund of the Treasury (Miscellaneous Receipts):
       8.45.2.1. MAJCOMs must identify and account for free assets to report them on an ―as
       needed‖ basis to HQ USAF. Free assets are funds derived from the sale of an item of
       materiel (weapon system/principal item) and which do not require replacement.
       8.45.2.2. Program managers must identify free assets from the sale of principal items at
       the time of price and availability, and in the FMS letter of offer and acceptance (LOA)
       and the case directive.
       8.45.2.3. Program managers must annotate the LOA with this statement: ―Funds
       collected in payment for this sale will be deposited in the miscellaneous receipts account
       of the Treasury.‖
       8.45.2.4. The case directive will include this statement: ―Principal item not to be
       replaced in the inventory. Funds collected in payment for this sale will be deposited in the
       miscellaneous receipts account of the Treasury.‖
8.46. Small Weapons Procurement. All small weapons and arms, such as the M-16 rifle,
9MM Compact Pistol, M-9 Pistol, grenade launchers, etc. are centrally procured in the 3011
Procurement of Ammunition Appropriation.
8.47. Power Conditioning and Continuation Interfacing Equipment (PCCIE):
   8.47.1. Charge PCCIE procured as an embedded or integral part of the system it supports to
   the same P-1 line as the system itself.
   8.47.2. Charge PCCIE procured to replace existing PCCIE or added to support a system to
   the ―Items Less Than‖ line in the BP 837XXX in Other Procurement (3080) or in a separate
   PCCIE P-1 line, if developed. For replacement or added PCCIE, including uninterruptible
   power supplies (UPS) and power conditioners (PCS) 1 KVA or larger, MAJCOMs must use

     central procurement or obtain a waiver from OO-ALC to allow local procurement. OO-ALC
     will provide funds for local purchase by issuing an obligation authority for an amount that
     covers the estimated cost of the item plus transportation costs from the vendor
     (https://intranet.hill.af.mil/hafb/alc/li/lip/lipc/lipc.htm).
     8.47.3. Use RDT&E (3600) for PCCIE procured to support RDT&E requirements.

Table 8.3. Test Program Sets (TPS). Follow these procedures for funding:

IF                                                 PAY FOR THE TEST PROGRAM SETS

A development effort is required to change the     RDT&E for initial set of TPS; use the same
capabilities of either ATE in the operational      procurement account for additional units.
inventory or off-the-shelf equipment
Operational or off-the-shelf equipment requires    Same procurement account for changes to TPS.

                                                   will serve
8.48. Bid Sample Testing for Non-Development Items (NDI). Fund bid sample testing for
NDI either in procurement or O&M based on applying the expense/investment criteria to the cost
of the NDI if it were being procured. Use RDT&E to modify an NDI bid sample. Use O&M for
related military or civil servant travel.
8.49. Program Management Administration (PMA) Costs: NOTE: This section does not
apply to FMS funds. The following sources provide guidance on the appropriate use of FMS
funds: DoD 7000-R, Volume 15, Chapter 7; DoD 5105.38M, the Security Assistance
Management Manual; AFMAN 16-101, International Affairs and Security Assistance
Management; and the ―FMS Administrative/Logistics Support Expense Budget Execution Plan,
Specific Costs to be Included or Excluded,‖ matrix provided by the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency.
     8.49.1. PMA Application. Procurement appropriations will be used to fund PMA costs that
     directly support production program activities for any program designated as a Program
     Executive Officer (PEO) program, regardless of Acquisition Category (ACAT),
     appropriation or Budget Program (BP). In addition, modification programs designated as
     acquisition programs which are managed at the Air Logistics Centers (ALCs) may continue
     to use the procurement appropriations to fund PMA. All other acquisition programs,
     including all acquisition programs of the ANG and Air Force Reserve, will continue to fund
     PMA costs in RDT&E or O&M. Due to its nature, PMA should be budgeted on an annual
     basis and reflected in the fiscal year during which the requirement is projected to execute.
188                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


  The appropriation used to fund PMA should be consistent with the work being performed
  and not determined simply by prorating between available appropriations. During execution,
  emergent PMA requirements may be paid from any fiscal year currently available for new
  obligation provided the appropriation cited is consistent with the task being supported and if
  the related action concerns an item authorized in the program authorization and budget
  authorization (PA or BA) documents issued for the appropriation year. Shortfalls in budgeted
  PMA requirements need to be paid from the same appropriation as originally budgeted for
  the effort.
  8.49.2. PMA Allowable Costs. PMA costs are defined as those direct, unique program
  costs, other than payroll costs for government personnel, which are required for the operation
  of a program office in its management and oversight role. These include costs such as travel,
  printing, supplies, equipment, program office unique computer and communication costs, and
  pre-litigation, to include Alternate Disputes Resolution (ADR) process (before contractor
  files appeal with ASBCA or initiates action in court) costs such as evaluation of claims.
  Advisory and Assistance Service (A&AS) and FFRDC contractor support to a program office
  is also PMA if it supports the functions of government personnel in managing a weapon
  system or common item. These program unique requirements should be budgeted in the
  weapon system PEC in either the RDT&E or procurement appropriation, and advocated by
  the using MAJCOM since these costs are reasonably considered part of the acquisition cost
  of the weapon system. For non-PEO programs, PMA in O&M is programmed and budgeted
  by AFMC and AFSPC in their respective PEs -- PE 72804 for AFSPC, PE 72806 for AFMC
  product centers and PE 78070 for the logistic centers See Table 8.4 for a matrix of allowable
  costs. NOTE: At its discretion, SAF/GCD may assist in the ADR process. As a HQ
  USAF function and the focal point for ADR issues, O&M (3400) funds are specifically
  appropriated to finance expenses incurred by that office for whatever ADR activities
  they choose to undertake. The involvement of SAF/GCD in any ADR process is at the
  sole discretion of that office.
  8.49.3. PMA Non-Allowable Costs. While PMA costs are legitimately included in the
  acquisition costs of weapon systems, it is critical that the Air Force avoid augmentation of
  the O&M appropriation by the RDT&E and procurement appropriations. As a result, PMA
  costs do not include civilian pay or overtime pay, base or installation operating support, or
  costs associated with Headquarters level support. Consequently, AFMC and AFSPC must
  consistently apply their definition of standard support elements (i.e. telephone service to a
  desk, computers at a workstation, etc.) that are O&M funded, regardless of whether the
  location is a product center, logistics center, Headquarters, or operating location. RDT&E
  and procurement funding is allowed only for those discrete program PMA requirements
  driven by unique program needs above the Command standard. Further, although investment
  funded, the PMA categorization excludes costs of tech orders, weapon system contract
  engineering (R&D, production or maintenance), contractor logistic support and contract
  litigation costs. However, once litigation begins (e.g., a contractor files an appeal with the
  Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals or initiates an action in court), litigation support
  costs, such as expert evaluation, are funded in O&M. These PMA cost exclusions are funded
  consistent with existing policy guidance contained in AFI 65-601, Vol I, and Air staff
  direction. Excluded costs fall under the cost categories of base operating support (BOS),
  Indirect Mission Support or Direct Mission Support.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             189


   8.49.4. BOS Costs. These are base O&M-type costs to provide common infrastructure
   support required by all installation offices regardless of mission. This includes the cost of
   standard furniture for a general purpose administrative office building in which program
   offices reside.
   8.49.5. Indirect Mission Support (IMS). These costs, other than payroll costs for
   government personnel that provide the Product Support Business Area infrastructure at a
   center. These tasks allow the center to perform its primary product support mission (e.g.
   general support, business area management, and product line management). IMS costs
   include travel, printing, supplies, equipment, staff office unique computer and
   communication costs, and other functional home office support costs. A&AS and FFRDC
   contractor support to a staff office is also IMS if it supports the functions of the government
   personnel in managing these cross-cutting activities. In all cases, IMS is advocated by
   AFMC.
   8.49.6. Direct Mission Support (DMS) Costs. Those costs, other than payroll costs for
   government personnel, that provide for an end item or operational capability for a weapon
   system or common item. These include costs such as technical orders, sustaining
   engineering, contractor logistics support, and equipment installation, A&AS and FFRDC
   contractor support is also DMS if it provides for an end item operational capability for a
   weapon system or common item.

                   MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS

Section 9A—Planning and Programming, Authorizations and Appropriations

9.1. Composition of Program. The Military Construction (MILCON) Program consists of the
appropriations below. See AFMAN 65-604 for specific project codes.

Table 9.1. Military Construction Appropriations.

57*3300 Military Construction, Air Force.
57*3730 Military Construction, Air Force Reserve.
57*3830 Military Construction, Air National Guard.
57*0740 Family Housing Construction. NOTE: For FY 01 and prior, use 57*7040
97*0103 Base Closure Account, Part I
97*0510, DoD Base Closure and Realignment Account, Part II
   9.1.1. Include in your construction program:
      9.1.1.1. All land acquisition.
      9.1.1.2. Acquiring and constructing facilities.
      9.1.1.3. Adding to, expanding, extending, converting, altering, or replacing existing
      facilities.
      9.1.1.4. Relocating facilities.
      9.1.1.5. Planning (other than master planning at operating levels) and design.
      9.1.1.6. Construction overhead, supervision, and inspection.
      9.1.1.7. Equipment installed in and made a part of real property structures and
      improvements (real property installed equipment RPIE).
      9.1.1.8. Demolition required to allow construction.
   9.1.2. Exclude all production and movable equipment. But, in presenting construction
   programs and budgets, you should also disclose the source and cost of all production and
   movable equipment directly associated with these programs. Also, you must reimburse
   funded project costs initially financed from other appropriations.
9.2. Obtaining Congressional Authorizations:
   9.2.1. Air Force and other Defense organizations must obtain specific congressional
   authorization for work under major construction programs. If it expires, the Air Force must
   seek reauthorization. Record obligations against the fiscal year in which the construction
   project was appropriated, not the year authorization was extended. NOTE: Legislative
   authorization for an active DoD component’s projects that have not started (no obligations
   incurred) expires at the later of these two dates:
 192                                                 AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       9.2.1.1. At the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year which authorized
       the project. (For example, a project authorized in FY 94 expires at the end of FY 96).
       9.2.1.2. Upon enactment of the Authorization Act for the third fiscal year (FY 97 in the
       previous example) following the fiscal year which authorized the project, whichever is
       later. Congressional committees must approve extension of the authorization in that third
       year act or the authorization expires.
   9.2.2. The Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard require separate congressional
   authorizations.
   9.2.3. The Air Force must present and justify MILCON programs through established
   MAJCOM and staff channels. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the Office
   of Management and Budget (OMB) then must approve these programs before they go to
   Congress for legislative authorization.
   9.2.4. MAJCOMs must support MILCON programs with data on proposed physical capacity
   or units of measurement, as well as estimated costs, for projects subject to the new
   authorization request. Arrange data for such projects by State and installation. Include
   comparative data on the existing real property inventory, previously authorized construction,
   and projects expected to be subject to future requests for authorization. MAJCOMs must also
   provide basic related data for new or changed missions and projected strength of forces. This
   information allows the Air Staff and OSD to determine how to assign parts of programs
   either to a request for immediate authorization or to a future request.
9.3. Obtaining Congressional Appropriations. To carry out military construction (MILCON)
projects, you must have authorization and appropriation of funds. Except for the Air Reserve
Forces construction program, if an authorized project is not in an approved ―appropriation act,‖
you must include it in a subsequent annual MILCON appropriation act or do an approved
reprogramming. Don’t try to reprogram a project for which Congress denied appropriations,
unless Congressional reports state the Air Force should do so.
9.4. Relating Budget Estimates and Appropriations:
   9.4.1. The Congressional appropriations committees approve individual projects, but the
   amounts appropriated may be less than their estimated cost. Don’t start an approved project
   unless you can finance it to completion from appropriated funds available at the time the
   project starts. But you may start a large project if OMB has approved incremental funding
   and the Air Force has obtained special legislative arrangements for full authorization and
   incremental appropriations.
   9.4.2. Use the funds in each annual appropriation act for:
       9.4.2.1. Cumulative adjustments (in light of balances of funds previously made
       available) needed to finance to completion projects already approved and started.
       9.4.2.2. Projects you expect to start during the current fiscal year.
       9.4.2.3. Projects that still represent valid requirements for the budget year.
       9.4.2.4. Amounts previously appropriated above actual cost to cover cost overruns or
       adjustments to other projects.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              193


   9.4.3. Handling Changes in Scope and Cost. AF/ILE and SAF/IE will determine if they
   must request approval in advance for major changes to approved projects. Requests must go
   through DoD, OMB, and the Appropriations and Armed Services Committees of Congress.
   Also, under 10 U.S.C. 2853 and Congressional committee reports, AF/ILE must notify
   Congress when a project’s scope decreases more than 25 percent or when its cost increases
   more than $2.0 million or 25 percent, whichever is less.
      9.4.3.1. Scope Changes. The DD Forms 1391 submitted to Congress show the scope of
      a facility in units of measure such as square feet of building space, square yards of
      pavement, etc. When Congress approves a project, they establish its scope.
          9.4.3.1.1. Don’t add more than 10 percent to the approved scope without prior
          approval of HQ USAF/ILE.
          9.4.3.1.2. Don’t decrease the approved scope by more than 25 percent without prior
          approval of HQ USAF/ILE and completion of Congressional notification action.
      9.4.3.2. Cost Increases. Adjust project financing consistent with Congressional
      authorization and the reprogramming criteria in DoD 7000.14-R, the DoD Financial
      Management Regulation (FMR), Vol. 3, Chapter 7. Chapter 7 of the FMR has the
      complete details on all reprogramming requirements and restrictions for Military
      Construction and Military Family Housing. Stay within total amounts appropriated in
      each annual appropriation act and follow restrictions in the following bullets. You may
      adjust financing to complete projects approved and started, to cover projects you expect
      to start during the current fiscal year, and to meet other project costs that represent valid
      unfinanced requirements for the budget year.
          9.4.3.2.1. Congress has authorized increased project costs above the appropriated
          amount, without a formal reprogramming request, up to 25 percent or $3.0 million
          dollars [10 U.S.C. 2853 ―200% of the minor consstruction ceiling….‖ currently $1.5
          million)], whichever is less. The Congress, in P.L. 107-107 (FY 02 NDAA, Sec. 2802
          amended 10 U.S.C. 2853) provided that ―the costs associated with the required
          remediation of an environmental hazard in connection with a military construction
          project or military housing project, such as asbestos removal, radon abatement, lead-
          based paint removal or abatement, or any other legally required environmental hazard
          remediation, if the required remediation could not have reasonably been anticipated at
          the time the project was approved originally by Congress‖ may be excluded from the
          military construction reprogramming threshold. However, it is Air Force policy that
          no increase is authorized without AF/ILE prior approval.
          9.4.3.2.2. Use projects authorized and appropriated by the Congress as offsets to
          cover cost increases for others previously approved by the appropriations committees
          under major construction programs. But first clear your actions with DoD and OMB,
          and get advance approval by the committees.

Section 9B—Funding Portable and Relocatable Buildings, Stress Tension Shelters,
Communications Pre-Wiring, Systems Furniture, Minor Construction and Air Conditioning
Equipment
 194                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


9.5. Portable Buildings. The organization or activity which orders a portable building through
the base supply system or has it constructed by the Base Civil Engineer will pay for the purchase
or construction from their O&M type funds. Apply the expense/investment $250,000 rule to
determine whether O&M or 57*3080 funds are chargeable.
9.6. Relocatable Buildings. AFI 32-1021 tells how to acquire, manage, and use relocatable
buildings. It also addresses approval levels for using relocatables on an installation. Apply the
established construction funding rules when a relocatable substitutes for a permanent structure.
Use Other Procurement (57*3080) funds for the building if you are buying it as an item of war
reserve stock. Charge the cost of transporting, assembling, and disassembling a relocatable
building for a temporary purpose to O&M type funds.
9.7. Stress Tension Shelters. Stress tension shelters (STS) (for example, Portomods) usually
have a fabric membrane in tension over a rigid frame.
   9.7.1. Charge construction funds for STS costs -- including acquisition, site preparation,
   foundation, erection, and utilities support -- as either a Military Construction Program (MCP)
   project, or a minor construction project accomplished with P-341 minor construction or
   O&M type funds. Use total project cost and normal dollar thresholds to select the proper fund
   source.
   9.7.2. Include the cost of relocating an STS from one installation to another and the fair
   market value of the STS as part of the construction costs of the new project.
   9.7.3. If a stress tension shelter is procured and erected on an existing foundation or pad (no
   MILCON required), it is procured as an equipment item in either Other Procurement (3080)
   or O&M (3400), depending application of the current expense/investment threshold.
9.8. Prewired Work Stations, Systems Furniture, Communications Prewiring:
   9.8.1. Prewired Work Stations. Charge the cost of prewired work stations to O&M. Do
   not charge the cost of prewired work stations as a part of a MILCON project (3300) when
   constructing a new facility or altering a facility (FY 97 PBD 376, 4 Dec 95). For MILCON
   projects, include the cost of the stations on the DD 1391, Military Construction Project
   Data, as a non-add entry in Block 9 for ―Equipment Provided from Other Appropriations.‖ In
   block 12b, list the equipment as an O&M funded item, the fiscal year in which the funds will
   be requested, and the line item cost. The O&M funds for prewired work stations must be
   identified separately in bidding documents for obligating and audit purposes. As excluded
   costs, the systems are retained as unit personal property and are not picked up on real
   property records.
   9.8.2. Systems Furniture. This term describes prewired work stations procured for a
   facility without MILCON additions or alterations. Use O&M-type funds (not O&M-type
   construction funds). If you are procuring the systems furniture as part of an O&M-funded
   minor construction project, don’t count the furniture against the $750,000 statutory limitation
   for construction.
   9.8.3. Communications Prewiring of Buildings to Support Information Systems and
   Services:
       9.8.3.1. When constructing, adding to, or altering a new facility, with MILCON funds or
       P341 Minor Construction funds, include:
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                          195


          9.8.3.1.1. All basic communications support required for information services and
          local area networking, including voice, data, facsimile, video, alarms, sensors, etc.
          9.8.3.1.2. All work within the building for telephone wiring, conduits, cable ducts,
          raceways, and modular jacks and outlets. (The wiring will not become real property.)
          9.8.3.1.3. All wiring, cabling, fiber optic cables (FOC), conduits, ducts, manholes,
          and pathways from the customer’s jacks to the point where the new facility will
          receive network services (dial tone and Internet protocol access).
      9.8.3.2. Exclude from communications prewiring:
          9.8.3.2.1. End instruments and equipment such as telephones, work stations, data
          terminals, switchboards, computers, etc.
          9.8.3.2.2. Any prewiring that is part of a minor construction project using O&M
          funds
      9.8.3.3. See ETL 02-12 for further details.
9.9. Unspecified Minor Construction:
   9.9.1. Apply Table 9.1 for project approval and reporting requirements.

Table 9.2. Unspecified Minor Construction Approval and Reporting.

FOR THESE PROJECTS                                  THIS GUIDANCE APPLIES


Projects costing     between    $750,000    and SAF approves.
$3,000,000                                          Must    satisfy   Congressional    notification
                                                    requirements.*


All projects over $750,000                          SAF approves
                                                    Must    satisfy   Congressional    notification
                                                    requirements.*
                                                    *Air Force must notify Congress in writing 21
                                                    days before obligating funds.


   9.9.2. HQ USAF/ILE manages regular Air Force funds. MAJCOM requests for these funds
   must meet the requirements of AFI 32-1021. HQ USAF reserves funds in the amount of the
   current working estimate when notified by the MAJCOM that an approved minor
   construction project is fully designed and is ready for procurement action.
   9.9.3. MAJCOMs must advise HQ USAF/ILE by message of the amount of the lowest
   acceptable bid, plus contingency. Funding will be on a project basis. MAJCOMs may not
   transfer funds to another project. The Guard and Reserve manage their own P-341 funds.
 196                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


9.10. O&M Minor Construction. Use O&M to cover projects whose funded cost is $750,000
or less. O&M funds may be used to fund a minor construction project costing between $750,000
and $1,500,000 if the project is justified to correct a deficiency that is life, health or safety
threatening (10 U.S.C. 2805). If the project will cost more than $750,000, submit it to HQ
USAF for further processing as either an unspecified minor construction or MILCON project.
You must use MILCON major or unspecified minor construction to reimburse the O&M type
construction funds for expenses incurred to that date. Reference AFI 32-1032, Planning and
Programming Appropriated Funded Maintenance, Repair, and Minor Construction Projects.
   9.10.1. The Air Force General Counsel (SAF/GCA) has made a legal determination that
   when the threshold for O&M minor military construction is increased by Congress amending
   10 U.S.C. 2805(c) (1)(B), the new threshold is applicable, retroactively, to minor military
   construction projects placed on contract prior to the date of the enactment of the law
   increasing the threshold. That means, any legitimate with-in scope cost increases, which may
   occur after enactment, will be subject to the newly enacted threshold and not the threshold in
   the law at the time the contract was executed.
9.11. Acquiring Air Conditioning Systems for New Construction or Additions. Use either
military construction (3300) or O&M minor construction (3400) funds (depending on current
funding threshold when you procure or install air conditioning systems as RPIE, for either
computer operations or human comfort (see paragraph 8.20).

Section 9C—Financial Management for Military Construction Projects

9.12. Financial Management Guidance. This section applies to acquiring and or constructing
of real property, including:
   9.12.1. Costs charged to appropriations available for military construction (funded costs).
   9.12.2. Costs financed by appropriations or funds other than those available for a specific
   construction project (unfunded costs). Capitalize these costs as part of the real property
   investment.
   9.12.3. Obligation and expenditure restrictions and limitations for military construction
   projects.
   9.12.4. Other related functions.
9.13. Funding for Planning and Design:
   9.13.1. You may fund planning and design to develop cost estimates for a project without
   specific Congressional authorization, as long as you stay within amounts otherwise
   appropriated (10 U.S.C. 2807). If the estimated design costs are more than $500,000, make
   sure the Secretary of the Air Force notifies the appropriate Congressional committees at least
   21 days before the initial obligation of funds for these services. (NOTE: Only active DoD
   Components must notify the committees.)
   9.13.2. Use design funds to pay for:
       9.13.2.1. Architectural and engineering services and construction design required for site
       investigation, survey, mapping, or sketches.
       9.13.2.2. Preparing cost estimates for construction and land acquisition projects.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             197


     9.13.2.3. Preparing plans, specifications, value engineering studies and construction
     contract documents.
     9.13.2.4. Managing construction projects chargeable to foreign governments if United
     States Armed Forces elements are the main users.
  9.13.3. Under the authority of planning and design, the Military Departments may
  also:
     9.13.3.1. Develop and update design criteria and manuals.
     9.13.3.2. Prepare standard designs and definitive drawings used on military construction
     projects.
     9.13.3.3. Manage design of military construction programs and contract administrative
     services for design.
     9.13.3.4. Certify project cost.
     9.13.3.5. Administer architectural and engineering service contracts to design
     construction and land acquisition projects.
     9.13.3.6. Print and reproduce bid documents, prepare pre-bid government estimates, and
     establish liaison with prospective bidders prior to award of a construction contract.
  9.13.4. Don’t use design funding to formulate a project. See paragraph 9.15.5 below for
  advance planning. Also, limit direct architectural engineering fees to six percent of the
  predetermined estimated construction cost of a project or part of a project to which
  architectural work applies (10 U.S.C. 9540).
  9.13.5. Funding Major Construction:
     9.13.5.1. Major military construction projects include all acquisition and construction,
     additions, expansions, extensions, conversions, alterations, or replacements of facilities
     with (a) costs above the amount specified by law as the maximum amount for a minor
     construction project or (b) any project, regardless of cost, approved as a specific line item
     in the Military Construction budget request.
     9.13.5.2. When determining the costs of a major construction project, include:
         9.13.5.2.1. Surveys and site preparation.
         9.13.5.2.2. Acquiring, converting, rehabilitating, and installing facilities.
         9.13.5.2.3. Acquiring and installing real property installed equipment and
         appurtenances.
         9.13.5.2.4. Acquiring and installing supporting facilities (including utilities) and
         appurtenances.
         9.13.5.2.5. Supervising, inspection, and overhead (SIOH).
         9.13.5.2.6. Acquiring or leasing temporary facility needed to house occupants of a
         building while the building is being altered in the MILCON program.
198                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


         9.13.5.2.7. Developing and supporting design for construction projects after
         construction award (includes change orders, value engineering proposals, and as-built
         drawings).
      9.13.5.3. Exclude from major construction those costs identified as minor construction,
      planning and design, or supporting activities.
  9.13.6. Funding Emergency Construction:
      9.13.6.1. Follow these general guidelines for emergency construction -- construction
      without authorization and appropriation. DoD Directive 4270.36 contains more detailed
      guidance. The Military Departments may do emergency construction if the requirement is
      so urgent that the project deferral for inclusion in the next Military Construction
      Authorization Act would be inconsistent with national security requirements, health,
      safety, or environmental quality. NOTE: Reserve Components can’t request emergency
      construction.
      9.13.6.2. To request approval for an emergency construction project, notify the Armed
      Services Committees and ask the DoD Comptroller to send the Appropriations
      Committees a request for reprogramming of military construction funds under section
      2803 of 10 U.S.C. and DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 3, Chapter 6. For each notification and
      reprogramming request:
         9.13.6.2.1. Justify and estimate the project cost.
         9.13.6.2.2. Justify the project as emergency construction.
         9.13.6.2.3. State the source of funds for the project.
      9.13.6.3. The Services and DoD Comptroller must coordinate to notify the Armed
      Services Committees and request reprogramming from the Appropriations Committees at
      the same time.
      9.13.6.4. The Air Force must finance emergency construction projects within amounts
      appropriated for military construction that have not been obligated for other purposes.
      The maximum amount that each Service may obligate in any fiscal year is established by
      law (currently $30 million).
      9.13.6.5. Don’t start actual construction before receiving DoD and congressional
      approval.
      9.13.6.6. Except as otherwise specified, follow the same restrictions and limitations for
      emergency construction projects as for major construction projects. Also, identify and
      treat costs for emergency construction projects in the same way as those for major
      construction projects.
  9.13.7. Funding Contingency Construction:
      9.13.7.1. Before using Contingency Construction authority (10 U.S.C. 2804), the Air
      Force must:
         9.13.7.1.1. Determine for each project financed under this authority that waiting to
         include it in the next Military Construction Authorization Act would be inconsistent
         with national security or national interest.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            199


        9.13.7.1.2. Obtain the Secretary of Defense approval.
        9.13.7.1.3. Notify the House and the Senate Committees on Armed Services and
        Appropriations.
        9.13.7.1.4. Wait 30 days after notifying Congress before obligating funds.
     9.13.7.2. The individual Services seldom use this authority. The Secretary of Defense
     will approve a project only if it directly supports a Defense-wide effort and the Service
     can justify why it can’t use its own emergency authority.
     9.13.7.3. Facilities for Operational Requirements (10 U. S.C. 101(a)(13)(A)) (See
     AFI 32-1032, IC 2002-1, Chapter 7).
        9.13.7.3.1. The fund source for facilities under this authority is the Air Force
        O&M (3400) Appropriation. The FY 2004 National Defense Authorization Act
        (NDAA) (P.L. 108-136) Section 2808 restricts the use of this authority to FY
        2004. The construction is required for operations in support of a declaration of
        war, the declaration by the President of a national emergency under section 201
        of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621), or a contingency operation.
        The only location in which this authority may be exercised is the geographical area
        for which the Combatant Command conducting the contingency operation is
        responsible and then, only in the area where actual operations are being conducted.
        The requirement for projects carried out under this authority should be in immediate
        and direct support of combat operations or force protection for those engaged in
        combat operations. It is particularly applicable in countries, friendly or not, where the
        United States does not currently have a significant permanent military presence. The
        construction is not to be carried out at a military installation where the United States
        is reasonably expected to have a long-term presence. It does not apply to a rear
        echelon even if that echelon provides support to the front-line troops. NOTE:
        The FY 2004 NDAA Section 2808 states, ―The temporary authority provided by
        this section, and the limited authority provided by section 2805(c) 10, United
        States Code, to use appropriated funds available for operation and maintenance to
        carry out a construction project are the only authorities available to the Secretary
        of Defense and the Secretaries of the military departments to use operation and
        maintenance to carryout construction projects.‖
        9.13.7.3.2. The application of the stated authority does not apply to any facility
        requirements costing less than $750,000, as they are provided for under other
        available authority, such as 10 U.S.C. 2805, Unspecified Minor Construction.
        9.13.7.3.3. The facilities to be constructed under this authority will be for an urgent
        military operational requirement the need for which is not expected to exceed two
        year, but is so pressing that the use of other authorities would not allow the
        requirement to be met. Hence, without regard to standard Air Force or Department of
        Defense facility construction standards, any facility provided under this authority will
        be designed and built as temporary construction -- the minimum necessary to meet
        the temporary operational requirements. The applied construction standard will
        recognize that the facility is only being provided to meet a temporary need and will
        be abandoned at the termination of operational requirements. Projects to which this
200                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


         authority may be applied include erection of facilities, acquisition of temporary
         interests in land, and design. Such projects may combine work typically considered as
         construction with work considered as services and may include repair of pre-existing
         facilities. Use relocatable or semi-permanent construction to the maximum, extent
         possible. For further detail, see AFI 32-1032, Interim Change (IC) 2002-1,
         Chapter 7, Paragraph 7.2).
         9.13.7.3.4. Approval Authorities. OUSD(C) February 27, 2003, memorandum,
         SUBJECT: Availability of Operation and Maintenance Appropriations for
         Construction, directs that OUSD(C) must approve “any proposals to expend
         operation and maintenance appropriations for construction necessary to meet
         temporary military operational exigencies”
         9.13.7.3.5. Certification and Reporting. The Air Force Component commander
         will recertify the operational requirement for the facility for continued use beyond the
         original approved time. SAF/IEI must approve continued use beyond 2 years. The
         request must include the original DD Form 1391 and operational justification for
         continued use of the facility. Requests for SAF/IEI approval will be submitted
         through the MAJCOM to AF/ILER for staffing. Both MAJCOM Commanders and
         Operational Commanders using this authority shall submit a monthly report listing all
         projects approved under this authority during the previous six months. an Operational
         Commander will submit the report through the appropriate MAJCOM Civil Engineer.
         These reports shall be submitted by the 15TH of each month to SAF/IEI with a copy to
         AF/ILER for review. SAF/IEI will make appropriate notification to congress no less
         than once a quarter.
         9.13.7.3.6. For additional detail on the use of the authority under 10 U.S.C.
         101(a)(13)(A) and documentation required, refer to AFI 32-1032, IC 2002-1,
         Chapter 7.
  9.13.8. Funding for Construction Authority in Event of Declaration of War or National
  Emergency (10 U.S.C. 2808). If the President declares war or a national emergency, the
  Secretary of Defense may authorize the Service Secretaries to undertake military
  construction. The Secretary of Defense issues special implementation rules.
  9.13.9. Funding Unspecified Minor Construction. Minor construction projects include all
  acquisition (except land), new construction, addition, expansion, extension, alteration,
  conversion, replacement, or installation of permanent or temporary facilities (except family
  quarters). Follow this guidance:
      9.13.9.1. The funded cost of the project may not exceed the amount specified by 10
      U.S.C. 2805 for the Active components and 10 U.S.C. 18233a. for the Reserve
      components.
      9.13.9.2. Don't include the project in the budget request as a specific line item.
      9.13.9.3. Make sure each minor construction authority project results in a complete real
      property facility or improvement. As much as possible, keep projects consistent with the
      installation master plan. In your request for approval, clearly show project's relation to
      the master plan and detail further planned construction to the same or closely related
      facilities.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                          201


     9.13.9.4. Notify appropriate congressional committees before starting a minor
     construction project costing more than $750,000 for Active components, or $200,000 for
     Reserve components. Don't start or obligate construction funds for projects until 30 days
     after the committees receive notification or after all committees approve the project.
     9.13.9.5. Don't use, on a nonreimbursable basis, materials, supplies, or installed capital
     equipment items on minor construction projects.
     9.13.9.6. Identify a project's end result and relate it to the installation's master plan
     before you establish it as a minor construction project.
     9.13.9.7. See details in AFI 32-1021 for a minor construction project's scope of work
     under 10 U.S.C. 2805 authority.
     9.13.9.8. Don't start incremental-type construction projects. Don't acquire or improve a
     real property facility through a series of minor construction projects.
     9.13.9.9. Notwithstanding any other provisions for approval of minor construction
     projects, the Air Force can't propose to complete a project under minor construction
     authority that Congress previously deleted from proposed military construction
     authorization legislation or otherwise disapproved.
  9.13.10. Funding Restoration or Replacement of Damaged or Destroyed Facilities:
     9.13.10.1. The Military Departments' Secretaries, after appropriate Secretary of Defense
     and Congressional approvals, may fund projects without previous legislative
     authorization and appropriation to repair, restore, or replace a damaged or destroyed
     facility.
     9.13.10.2. Request approval for restoring or replacing damaged or destroyed facilities
     requiring military construction by notifying the Armed Services Committees through the
     DoD Comptroller. If military construction is required for restoration or replacement, a
     military construction reprogramming request to the Appropriations Committees
     according to 10 U.S.C. 2854 and DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 3, Chapter 6. Include the project's
     justification, the current cost estimate, and the source of funds.
     9.13.10.3. Restoration or replacement requiring military construction may be financed
     from unobligated amounts within Air Force MILCON appropriations.
     9.13.10.4. Don't start construction before the Appropriations Committee approves the
     reprogramming.
  9.13.11. Funding Supporting Activities (23 U. -S.C. 210). This section covers access
  roads the Air Force requires in conjunction with construction, expansion, improvement,
  replacement, or relocation of DoD facilities.
     9.13.11.1. Don't fund the project until the Military Traffic Management Command
     approves the project.
     9.13.11.2. Don't use these funds to finance roads within the boundaries of a military
     reservation. (Charge these highways to major construction, emergency construction, or
     minor construction programs, as applicable.) Normally you cannot use these funds to
     finance projects in the regular Federal Aid Primary Systems.
 202                                                  AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011

       authorizes using up to $500,000 of operation and maintenance funds for land acquisition
       as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2672).
       9.13.12.2. All construction efforts or any contribution authorized by law, as specifically
       authorized by law, necessary to produce a complete and usable facility or improve an
       existing facility.
       9.13.12.3. Real property installed equipment (RPIE) installed in and made part of real
       property structures or improvements. But, you must (1) exclude all production and

   construction.
   9.14.2. Charge the military construction appropriation for projects with a funded cost over
   $750,000 (current legal threshold). The threshold doesn't apply to family housing projects.
   O&M funds may be used to fund a minor construction project costing between $750,000 and
   $1,500,000 if the project is justified to correct a deficiency that is life, health or safety
   threatening. Apply the correct O&M-type funds from Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
   appropriation, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriation, or
   DWCF resources.
   9.14.3. Funded Project Costs. Funded costs are costs incurred during the construction
   phases. (Exceptions are in paragraph 9.15) Charge them to the applicable military
   construction appropriation. Funded costs include the following:

     solely to support the equipment.
     9.15.3.3. An upgrade, alteration, conversion, or expansion of an entire existing facility is
     funded as construction. The movable and detachable equipment (non-RIPE) is still
     funded according to 9.15.3.1 and 9.15.3.2 above.
  9.15.4. Don't charge construction for installation or relocation costs of moveable or
  detachable operational equipment items. Charge such costs to O&M appropriations; RDT&E
  appropriations; procurement appropriations; or DWCF resources as appropriate:
     9.15.4.1. Prefabricated screens, partitions, special foundations, false floors, platforms,
     shielding for electromagnetic radiating services, and prefabricated clean rooms.

       9.16.1.1. You must have specific authorization for work performed under major
       construction programs unless the project is under:
          9.16.1.1.1. One of the authorities provided by Title 10, U.S.C., sections 2233a, 2672,
          2672a, 2675, 2803, 2904, 2805, 2808, 2810, 2854, or
          9.16.1.1.2. Other authorities used to carry out a project not otherwise specifically
          authorized.
       9.16.1.2. The Authorization Act contains the authorization and, usually, a limitation on
       total project costs. Don't exceed the total amount authorized for any appropriation. But, in
       certain circumstances, individual cost limitations authorize overruns, within stated
       percentages.
   9.16.2. Handling Obligation and Expenditure Restrictions. All levels of command must:
       9.16.2.1. Comply with DoD Directive 7200.1, Administrative Control of Appropriations,
       DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 14, Administrative Control of Funds and Antideficiency Act
       Violations, and the Antideficiency Act.
       9.16.2.2. Establish adequate funds control according to DoD 700.14-R, Vol. 4 to ensure
       that the Air Force completes individual projects consistent with authorized purposes and
       within authorized and available funds.
   9.16.3. Unless otherwise specifically provided for, the cost estimate for each project
   approved by the Congress is not a separate statutory cost limitation. Report major physical or
   financial changes in previously approved individual projects, through Air Staff and SAF
   channels, in advance, to both the Armed Services Committees and Appropriations
   Committees for their approval. First, obtain proper clearance within the Department of
   Defense and OMB.

  construction appropriation funding allocation to any operating agency. Operating agencies
  will issue only one fund allotment from any allocation to each operating unit.
  9.16.7. SAF/FMB and each operating agency must include on each allocation or allotment
  only the additional obligation limitations established by OMB or the Secretary of Defense, or
  as otherwise required by the Congress or the President. Every level of command must
  comply with separate limitations imposed on total costs by legislative authorizations and by
  administrative action connected with all budgetary and funding actions as well as with
  program execution.
  9.16.8. When you do construction work or services for another Military Department,
  Defense Agency, or another Federal agency, do so on a reimbursable basis based on the
  orders to be reimbursed to your construction appropriation. (There is one EXCEPTION:
  Army Corps of Engineers, Naval Facilities Engineering Command or the Air Force Civil

       170403, MAJCOMs and operating units responsible for construction projects must
       prepare the certification of incurred costs.
          9.16.11.1.1. These certifications include statements of total cost incurred on the
          project, the funded part of total costs, and a statement that funded costs incurred don't
          exceed authorized amounts.
          9.16.11.1.2. Disclose authorized amounts and the approving authority with the
          statement of total and funded costs.
       9.16.11.2. Prepare the certification within 60 days after the project's completion. The
       installation commander, the responsible civil engineering official, and the responsible

                                          Chapter 10

         OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, AIR FORCE, APPROPRIATION

Section 10A—Scope

10.1. Purpose. This chapter applies to all levels of command that use these appropriations:
   10.1.1. Operation and Maintenance (O&M), Air Force, 57*3400.
   10.1.2. Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) 57*3600, appropriation for
   AFMC-controlled installations Management and Support Funds and AFSPC.
   10.1.3. Statutory Prohibition. O&M (3400) funds are not to be used for the operation,
   repair, and maintenance of Military Family Housing. The Military Construction
   Appropriations Act of FY 2000 (P.L. 106-52, Sec. 128) directs that “funds appropriated
   in the Military Construction Appropriations Acts for operation and maintenance of
   family housing shall be the exclusive source of funds for repair and maintenance of all
   family housing units, including flag and general officer quarters” (See AFI 32-6002,
   Family Housing Planning, Programming, Design, and Construction.''
   10.1.4. Transportation Subsidy. Consistent with OMB Circular A-11, agencies are to
   report the costs of this program in Object Class 12.1, Civilian Personnel Benefits, and 12.2,
   Military Personnel Benefits. Transportation subsidy costs for the affected individuals will be
   budgeted in the same appropriation/fund that pays compensation costs. Therefore, civilian
   personnel transportation subsidy benefit should be budgeted in the appropriation/fund which
   finances their compensation and the military personnel transportation subsidy benefit will be
   budgeted in the appropriate military personnel appropriation. The amount claimed should be
   the actual amount spent not to exceed $100. Compensation costs are those that are reported in
   object class 11 for the appropriation. (OSD Comptroller Sep 12, 2000 Memo, Subject: Fiscal
   Year (FY) 2002/2003 Defense Budget Review -- Additional Guidance)
   10.1.5. Parking Expense Reimbursement for Certain Members and Civilians. The
   JFTR (U350) and the JTR (C2600) provide that Air Force members and civilians in the
   positions enumerated below are to be reimbursed for that portion of their monthly parking
   expenses in excess of $25.00 but not to exceed the amount that can be excluded from taxable
   income under federal income tax provisions ($185.00 per month in 2002). For example, if the
   cost of parking is $135.00 per month, the member will be reimbursed $110.00 ($135.00
   minus $25.00 deductible), If the cost is $320.00 per month, the member is entitled to the full
   $185.00 reimbursement. This authority does not permit contracting for parking. This
   reimbursement authority constitutes all the expenses that are authorized for parking a POV at
   a PDS work site or TDY site where assigned to duty :
        1. as a recruiter for any of the armed forces;
        2. at an armed forces military entrance processing facility; or
        3. while detailed for instructional or administrative duties at any institution
            where an SROTC unit is maintained.

Section 10B—Temporary Duty Travel (TDY)
 210                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


10.2. Funding TDY Costs:
   10.2.1. As a rule, each Air Force activity must pay for its personnel's TDY expenses using
   regular administrative or operating funds. AFI 33-328, Administrative Orders, shows how to
   curtail official travel and reduce costs. This section assigns funding responsibilities for
   special TDY categories. Use only EEIC 409 for all TDY expenses.
   10.2.2. When travel overlaps two fiscal years, make sure the orders-issuing activity cites
   the accounting classification codes for both fiscal years on the travel request or order.
   Specific direction in the DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Vol. 9, Chapter 2, Paragraph 020601 states,
   ―In the event of a trip that is initiated using currently available fiscal year funding, but which
   requires new fiscal year funding to continue or complete the travel, the traveler shall return to
   his or her official duty station if no appropriation act has been signed or no continuing
   resolution has been passed to make available new fiscal year funds.‖ It concludes, ―Expenses
   incurred in returning to the traveler’s duty station will be posted in the new fiscal year as
   necessary costs to close down operations.‖
   10.2.3. Supervisors strongly encourage make sure military members and civilian employees
   use government quarters when they're TDY to a military installation where adequate on base
   quarters (as defined in AFI 34-246, Air Force Lodging Program) are available. Follow
   government quarters use/ availability guidance in JFTR, Volume1I, U1045 for military and
   JTR, Volume 2, C1055 for civilians. But don't apply this rule to civilian employees whose
   duties require official travel for more than 50 percent of their basic administrative
   workweeks during a fiscal year (JTR, Volume 11, Paragraph C1055). For TDY, anywhere
   other than a military installation, don't require anyone to commute to the nearest military
   installation to occupy government quarters. If members voluntarily use quarters at a nearby
   military installation, don't require them to use available messing facilities. MAJCOMs may
   encourage members or employees to use government facilities when it is economical and
   consistent with mission requirements.
   10.2.4. Retention of Promotional Items on TDY. A traveler on official business traveling
   at Government expense on the funds of an agency may keep promotional material (including
   frequent traveler benefits such as points or miles, upgrades or access to carrier clubs or
   facilities for personal use. (See FY 02 NDAA, Sec. 1116; JFTR, Chapter 1, Part B, Paragraph
   U1200; JTR Chapter 1, Part D, Paragraph C1200)
   10.2.5. Off-Base Conferences. Watch costs when selecting off-base conference sites to
   meet the public's interest (OMB Bulletin 93-11; JTR-C4950; JFTR-U2550). Whenever
   possible, use the Air Force's own conference sites. If the sponsor requires a civilian
   environment, select a nearby, inexpensive, low-key site. To reduce travel and per diem costs,
   avoid highly visible and expensive tourist or recreational areas. The JTR and JFTR address
   at length the actions required before choosing an off-base site.
       10.2.5.1. The Secretary of the Air Force has also directed that the following criteria must
       be considered for all USAF sponsored conferences:
          10.2.5.1.1. Consider whether       the conference is necessary for the organization’s
          mission,
          10.2.5.1.2. Evaluate the cost differences of prospective sites, and
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            211


         10.2.5.1.3. Limit attendance to the minimum number of individuals required.
     10.2.5.2. Approval authorities for off-base conferences, as directed by the Secretary
     of the Air Force, are as follows:
         10.2.5.2.1. For the Secretariat, it will be the Administrative Assistant to the
         Secretary (SAF/ AA). (NOTE: Organizations are reminded that conference rooms
         with costs associated for their use in the NCR must also be requested/coordinated
         through the Washington Headquarters Service office per DoDI 5305.5, Space
         Management Procedures, National Capital Region.)
         10.2.5.2.2. For the Air Staff and National Capital Region (NCR), it will be the
         Assistant Vice Chief of Staff (AF/CVA). (See NOTE in 10.2.4.2.1.)
         10.2.5.2.3. For all MAJCOMs, the Vice Commander may delegate approval
         authority to Numbered Air Force Commanders for wing-level events only.
         10.2.5.2.4. For all FOAs, approval authority oversight will rest in the HQ USAF two
         letter (i.e., DCS) having oversight of their activity.
         10.2.5.2.5. For the Air Force Academy, the Superintendent, and for AFOTEC, the
         Commander, will be the approval authority.
         10.2.5.2.6. Organizations holding conferences at government facilities are not
         required to evaluate facility cost differences of possible or alternate local government
         facility locations, but thorough consideration must be given to TDY travel cost for
         attendees traveling outside their locale.
         10.2.5.2.7. Documentation of compliance with this SECAF direction should be
         maintained for inspection by Inspector General and other interested parties. (NOTE:
         The JFTR (military), Paragraph U2550 and the JTR (civilian), Paragraph C4950 state,
         ―DoD Agencies must maintain a record of the cost of each alternative conference site
         considered for each conference sponsored or funded. A minimum of three sites must
         be considered for the conference and the documentation must be available for
         inspection by the Office of the Inspector General or other interested parties.‖)
  10.2.6. The requesting organization will fund manning assistance TDY. This does not alter
  existing funding responsibilities for mission related travel.
  10.2.7. To comply with OSD (C) and DFAS-DE policy on simplified travel accounting, all
  TDY costs (transportation, per diem, incidentals, excess baggage, lodging, vehicle
  rental, or any other expense authorized to be paid on the travel voucher) will be
  accounted for only with EEIC 409. Do not use any other 40X EEIC to record TDY costs.
  Additionally, do not use a 2-digit shred of EEIC 409 unless specifically authorized by your
  command to capture specific travel program data information.
  10.2.8. 179 Day Rule. Air Force members who are TDY in excess of 179 days (to include
  travel days, training days and days at the final destination) may not require a Secretarial
  waiver to receive travel payments for TDY/TAD assignments in excess of six months at any
  one location, as stated in the JFTR Paragraph U2145. The six month limitation does not
  apply to ―personnel assigned to periods of TDY at more than one location that total more
  than six months if the period of duty at each location is six months or less.‖ Travel time and
  time at an enroute location should not be combined with time at the final destination when
 212                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   determining compliance with the 179 day rule. Because this time is cumulative and not time
   at one location, a Secretarial waiver is not required to make the travel payment to the
   member.
   10.2.9. TDY for PME Graduation. As part of a Commander’s, First Sergeant’s, and
   Command CMSgt’s duty requirement to represent the squadron or the Command at PME
   Graduations, funded TDYs are authorized for them or their designated representative. Per
   AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, Table 7, Item 37 and Paragraph 12.8. (12.8.5.),
   permissive TDY (PTDY) is authorized for the individual’s supervisor or their representative.
   10.2.10. TDY for Retirement Ceremonies. Appropriated funds may be authorized by the
   travel approval authority for the unit or organization hosting a retirement ceremony for TDY
   travel to the retirement ceremony by an active duty military member or current Federal
   civilian employee who will officiate or otherwise substantially participate in the ceremony.
   Funding must be sourced from within existing funds at the local or MAJCOM level. Travel
   funded using this authority is available to Guard or Reserve members only when they are on
   Active Duty status. Appropriated funds are not authorized for funding of TDY travel by
   other individuals (including retired or former military members, or retired or former civilian
   employees) to preside or participate in a retirement ceremony. Participation means more than
   mere attendance, it means actual participation, for example, presenting an award or
   decoration to the retiree or doing the invocation at the beginning of the retirement ceremony.
   Prior to approval, travel approval authorities must determine that the trip is necessary official
   business in order to accomplish the Air Force mission effectively and economically.
10.3. Funding Travel Related to Training Courses. Follow these rules to finance travel
expenses for attending USAF Formal Training and other training courses:
   10.3.1. Civilian Employees. The Employee Development Manager (EDM) within the local
   Central Civilian Personnel Office (CCPO) normally manages and funds TDY to USAF
   formal schools or other training, per AFI 36-401. The EDM centrally budgets and manages
   training funds.
   10.3.2. Air Reserve Forces (ARF). The student's assigned organization pays the TDY to
   schools or other instructional courses for ARF members (Air National Guard (ANG) and Air
   Force Reserve (AFRC)). But, when ordering the student to active duty to fulfill an Air Force
   mission requirement, apply the funding rules for active duty military personnel (see 10.3.3).
   10.3.3. Active Duty Military Personnel. In general, if the Education and Training Course
   Announcement (ETCA) (https://etca.keesler.af.mil/) doesn't provide an AETC or AFMC
   funding guidance or if it doesn't list the course, the member's unit of assignment will pay the
   TDY cost unless this instruction or other Air Force instructions say otherwise.
       10.3.3.1. AETC-Funded USAF Formal Training Courses. AETC or AFMC, as
       appropriate, pays TDY expenses to attend schools in this category, including travel and
       per diem from overseas to the Continental United States (CONUS), Air Force point of
       debarkation (AFPOD), and CONUS Air Force point of embarkation (AFPOE). The
       Education & Training Course Announcement (ETCA) provides the AETC or AFMC
       funding guidance for these travel orders as well as the conditions a TDY must meet for
       funding.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            213


     10.3.3.2. Other than AETC-Funded USAF Formal Training Courses. The member's
     unit of assignment pays TDY and other expenses to attend schools or other courses of
     instruction in this category.
     10.3.3.3. Command Operated Schools. The individual student's or instructor's
     assigned Air Force activity pays expenses of travel and per diem for students or
     instructors at command courses.
  10.3.4. TDY for Formal Training Incident to Permanent Change of Station PCS. Apply
  the following guidance whether a member returns to the current duty station before the PCS
  or goes directly to the new duty station after completing a TDY.
     10.3.4.1. AETC or AFMC pays for TDY to USAF formal training courses along with, or
     incident to, a military PCS, when
         10.3.4.1.1. The Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) imposes the training requirement
         in the assignment instructions or
         10.3.4.1.2. When the gaining command receives a training quota from AETC or
         AFMC and properly notifies the losing Military Personnel Flight (MPF).
     10.3.4.2. When the gaining command levies formal training requirements, or non-formal
     training, without the appropriate AETC or AFMC quota, it must pay for the TDY, and
     provide a proper fund citation to the losing MPF.
     10.3.4.3. Charge to PCS movement funds any transoceanic travel costs for directed TDY
     to CONUS incident to PCS. These costs are a PCS expense. Pay for TDY costs within
     CONUS as discussed above. Transoceanic travel costs include travel from an overseas
     assignment (includes Alaska and Hawaii) to the CONUS port of entry. When the losing
     and gaining commands are both non-CONUS, the travel expenses to the CONUS port of
     entry, and from the CONUS port of debarkation to the gaining command, are a PCS
     expense. Orders directing the transoceanic TDY must:
         10.3.4.3.1. State that the TDY is along with or incident to a PCS.
         10.3.4.3.2. Identify the command funding the TDY. Guidance for getting fund cites
         is in the Education & Training Course Announcement: https://etca.keesler.af.mil.
         10.3.4.3.3. Reference the PCS assignment instructions that established the
         requirement.
     10.3.4.4. Charge TDY-Enroute-PCS to attend a command-operated school to the
     command which operates the school.
     10.3.4.5. TDYs en route to PCS are the responsibility of the gaining units for courses
     that are not identified as AETC funded USAF Formal Training courses and are a
     requirement of the gaining unit. If the required training is a requirement of the losing
     unit, then the losing unit must bear the cost. Cost not covered by the PCS for a course not
     identified as an AETC funded USAF Formal Training Course is the responsibility of the
     gaining unit.
  10.3.5. Screening School Candidates. Make sure candidates scheduled for TDY to school
  qualify to enter the training program. If the training activity finds a person unqualified, the
  person's unit of current duty assignment will pay all costs for the TDY. If necessary, before
 214                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   settling the member's travel claim, the issuing activity will amend the orders to show that the
   unqualified person's unit pays for the TDY.
   10.3.6. Guest Lecturers. The command that directs or makes the invitation will pay travel
   expenses of all guest lecturers.
   10.3.7. TDY-Enroute-PCS for Security Assistance Organizations (SAOs). The Air Force
   funds military specialty training refresher training and language, advisor, management
   (except for DISAM funding of DISAM courses), and other training required to qualify
   people for SAOs. The Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) will budget and fund for
   TDY-Enroute-PCS required for this purpose in PEC A1010F. Charge orientation training and
   briefings at unified commands and Washington, DC to appropriate security assistance funds.
10.4. Funding TDY for Special Technical and Flying Training. Charge to AETC training
established by AETC under AFI 36-2201. Otherwise, unless otherwise directed, charge these
costs to the MAJCOM to which the individual is assigned.
10.5. Funding TDY for Field and Mobile Training (AF1 36-2201). Apply these rules to fund
TDY travel of students and instructors to field training detachments (FTD) or to attend training
conducted by mobile training teams (MTT):
   10.5.1. The organization of the parent command to which a person is assigned funds students
   trained by FTDs or MTTs attached to their parent command.
   10.5.2. AETC funds students trained by FTDs or MTTs attached to other than their parent
   command only if AETC has allocated training quotas. Otherwise, the student's parent
   command funds the TDY.
   10.5.3. The instructor's assigned FTD or MTT funds intracommand travel of FTD or MTT
   instructors ordered by that command.
   10.5.4. AETC funds intercommand travel of FTD or MTT instructors.
   10.5.5. AETC funds for the TDY of MTT instructors to and from technical training centers.
10.6. Funding Travel of Air Force Military Applicants for the United States Air Force
Academy (USAFA). Use the applicant's assigned unit's O&M funds to pay TDY of Air Force
military applicants for the USAFA under AFI 36-2019. The military member concerned bears
the cost of travel for examination to compete for congressional nomination.
10.7. Funding Travel to Support Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) or
Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E). The Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation
Center (AFOTEC) will use RDT&E to pay the costs of TDY travel for people assigned to
commands and operational units that provide collateral support to the IOT&E effort. See
Chapter 14 for TDY funding connected with DT&E.
10.8. Funding Travel for Safety Escort Crews on Board Foreign Special Mission
Aircraft. The Air Force Intelligence Service (AFIS) will budget and fund all required travel.
10.9. Funding Travel for Air Force Recruiters. AETC funds these costs.
10.10. Funding Travel Related to Ferrying Aircraft. See AFI 11-207 and AFI 23-202 for
related guidance. Pay for deliveries as follows:
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               215

10.11. Funding Travel of Escorts for Dependents of Deceased or Missing Air Force
Military Personnel. Charge escort TDY to the operating funds of the order issuing activity
except when an AFMC passenger-control agency issues the order at an overseas commander's
request. In this case, cite the requesting agency's O&M funds. The base mortuary officer certifies
fund availability, then prepares and approves payment vouchers (AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affair
Program).
10.12. Funding Travel to Attend Meetings of Technical, Professional, Scientific, and Other
Similar Organizations. If approved by proper authority, charge TDY expenses to the O&M-
type funds of the attendee's organization of assignment.
10.13. Funding Attendance at National Rifle and Pistol Matches by Air Force
Personnel. MAJCOMs may authorize people to take part in matches sponsored by the National
Rifle Association. Charge a participant's TDY to the command's O&M funds. AFPC/DPASF
pays the TDY for teams sponsored by HQ USAF.
10.14. Funding Travel Related to Logistics Evaluation of Independent Research and
Development (LEIR&D). The Air Force Coordinating Office for Logistics Research
(AFCOLR) budgets and funds travel related to LEIR&D, upon mutual agreement between
AFCOLR and the traveler's unit of assignment.
10.15. Funding Travel Related to Disability Retirement Processing Under AFI 36-
3212. For TDY of military members directed to meet medical or physical disability boards to
determine eligibility for retention, disability retirement, or separation, charge O&M funds of the
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              217


medical facility that directed the action. Charge TDY travel of temporary retired military
personnel to take physical examinations to funds made available to AFPC.
10.16. Funding Witness Travel. Table 10.2 defines travel funding responsibilities for
witnesses required for boards, investigations, and courts-martial. The type of travel is
"intercommand" when the individual requested is assigned to a different MAJCOM than the
convening authority exercising jurisdiction over the case at the time of the request. It is
"intracommand" when the individual requested is assigned to the same MAJCOM as the
convening authority exercising jurisdiction over the case at the time of the request. When a
convening authority is identified as the funding authority, the convening authority at the time the
travel is required provides the funding. For example, a special court-martial convening authority
who orders an Article 32 investigation funds applicable travel for the investigation. See AFI 51-
201, Administration of Military Justice, for guidance when AFLSA/JAJM is identified as the
funding authority.

1.        The JFTR, Volume 1, Chapter 7, Part O, covers travel of members for disciplinary
action. The TDY orders for members traveling as an Accused must include a statement ―member
not entitled to per diem expenses in connection with disciplinary action.”
2.    Funding by USAF Judiciary circuit to which assigned ONLY for USAF Judiciary
Members. The Convening Authority funds costs for other individuals.
3.      The USAF Judiciary Circuit to which assigned when the attorney-client relationship
was formed.
4.       AFLSA/JAJM will fund if the IMDC is not assigned to the USAF Judiciary at the time
the IMDC request is made and had no prior attorney-client relationship with the requestor on the
matter in issue.
5.    The JFTR, Volume 1, Paragraph U7060 directs that travel expenses of members
summoned as witnesses shall be paid from funds of the requesting Service.
6.       Submit requests through local AFOSI detachments. Fund according to the status of
the person requested (e.g., AF Active Duty, Reservist, ANG, civilian, etc. as noted in the table).
7.      AFOSI agents assigned as defense investigators to an accused and defense counsel are
funded by the Convening Authority.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                219


8.        For expert witnesses in urinalysis cases, request AFLSA/JAJM funding in accordance
with AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice. All fees in excess of AFLSA/JAJM
established fee limits shall be paid by the convening authority. The Convening Authority funds
civilian expert consultants and lab technicians in urinalysis cases.
9.        Funding for testimony of Federal civilian employees belonging to non-DoD Agencies is
a Convening Authority responsibility. However, if a non-DoD Federal civilian employee is
being called to present testimony in a case that involves an activity in connection with which he
or she is employed, funding from the employing agency may be possible. See 5 U.S.C. 5751 and
28 CFR, Part 21, Section 21.2(d). The Comptroller General has defined the extent to which the
case must be related to the agency’s activity as a condition to the agency’s responsibility for
payment in 23 Comp. Gen. 47, 49 (1943) which states, ―the employing agency is required to pay
the traveling expenses incurred by the employee witness only where the information or facts
ascertained by the employee as part of his official duties forms the basis of the case, or where
the proceeding is predicated upon law that that agency is required to administer.” Funding from
other agencies under 5 U.S.C. 5751 should only be sought in situations where the other agency’s
funding responsibility can be clearly established under the law. Furthermore, if the employing
agency is not forthcoming with the funds, ultimate responsibility for funding to ensure the
presence of necessary witnesses remains with the Convening Authority.
10.     AFLSA/JAJM will fund ANG members who are in Title 10 status at the time travel is
required if it involves intercommand travel between the Title 10 duty station and the location of
the UCMJ proceeding.
11.    The JFTR, Volume 1, Paragraph U7451 and AFI 31-205 cover funding of prisoners and
prisoner escorts. The prisoner’s travel will be funded according to the status of the prisoner (e.g.,
AF Active Duty, Reservist, ANG, civilian, etc. as noted in the table). The Convening Authority
requesting the prisoner’s appearance will provide escort funding.
10.17. Funding Travel Related to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)
Complaints. Apply this following guidance to fund expenses for individual complaints as well
as class complaints of discrimination, (AFI 36-1201):
   10.17.1. The DoD Civilian Personnel Management Service (CPMS), Office of Complaint
   Investigation (OCI) investigates formal EEO complaints for DoD Components. Effective 1
   Jan 00, there is a flat fee of $250.00 for each investigation. The activity where the
   discrimination allegedly occurred will fund the fee using the Government Purchase Card.
       10.17.1.1. The activity will also fund expenses of the Equal Employment Opportunity
       Commission (EEOC) examiner (as billed by EEOC) and payment for court reporters and
       attorneys, as well as, travel expenses when a hearing examiner or other authorized
       official requires travel of non-Air Force people (complainants, representatives, or
       witnesses) and authorized under chapter 4 or chapter 6, volume II, of the JFTR.
   10.17.2. Apply the following guidance for these other situations:
       10.17.2.1. The Air Force Civilian Appellate Review Agency (AFCARA/AED) pays
       travel expenses of EEO complaint AFCARA investigations.
 220                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       10.17.2.2. When a class complaint alleges discrimination at more than one activity, the
       class agent's permanently assigned activity pays expenses of the EEOC examiner, court
       reporters, and attorneys (AFI 36-1201).
       10.17.2.3. When a hearing examiner or other authorized official requires Air Force
       people (complainants, representatives, or witnesses) to participate, charge the travel to the
       Air Force participant's unit of assignment. The activity where the discrimination
       allegedly occurred pays travel expenses for AFCARA personnel called as witnesses.
       10.17.2.4. When a class complaint alleges discrimination at more than one activity,
       charge authorized expenses of non-Air Force people to the permanently assigned class
       agent's activity.
       10.17.2.5. If a complaint of discrimination is filed against a tenant organization, the
       tenant pays the hearing costs and attorney fees and costs unless otherwise provided for in
       a host-tenant agreement (see AFI 25-201). Refer problems between the host and tenant to
       the parent MAJCOM, Attn: EEO Officer, for resolution.
       10.17.2.6. When the complaint involves a nonappropriated fund (NAF) activity, the host
       activity bears the costs. The host activity's commander may recoup costs from the NAF
       instrumentality.
10.18. Funding Travel Related to Emergency Leave. If a member is authorized emergency
leave that requires movement from overseas to CONUS or from CONUS to overseas, and he or
she is:
   10.18.1. Permanently assigned to an overseas or CONUS Air Force installation, charge the
   cost of TWCF airlift to the O&M type funds of the member's unit of assignment.
   10.18.2. Permanently assigned to duty on a non-Air Force installation, charge the TWCF
   airlift cost to the O&M type funds of the member's permanently assigned unit.
   10.18.3. Performing TDY, charge the airlift to the same funds that put the member on TDY.
   You do not need prior concurrence of the financial services officer administering the funds.
   However, the base or activity issuing the emergency leave order must immediately send a
   message to the financial services officer containing the emergency leave special order
   number, date, name and social security number (SSN) of member, accounting classification
   cited, and estimated amount of the TWCF airlift cost chargeable to the funds. Forward a copy
   of the orders within 24 hours to the financial services officer who administers the funds cited.
10.19. Funding Dependent Student Travel. When dependent students travel on annual trips
from schools in the United States to and from your overseas area, including Alaska and Hawaii,
charge these costs to the permanently assigned student's sponsor organization's operating funds.
Don't pay this transportation allowance for members assigned to a permanent duty station in
Alaska or Hawaii and the child attends school in that state. These costs apply against any
limitation which Congress might apply for such travel.
10.20. Funding Medical Related Travel. See this Chapter, Section 10C.
10.21. Funding Travel for The USAF Occupational Measurement Center
(USAFOMC). The USAFOMC budgets and funds for travel requirements of subject matter
experts from other units who must help the USAFOMC rewrite promotion tests.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            221


10.22. Financing Contract Quarters for Air Force and DoD Employees in a Travel Status
(Includes Members of the Active and Reserve Forces). To reduce appropriated fund
expenditures for per diem, base billeting offices must arrange contract quarters agreements with
commercial motels and hotels to lodge official travelers when on base quarters are not available.
   10.22.1. When planning travel, each organization and each unit of the Air Reserve Forces
   that schedules active duty tours must tell the duty base or bases in advance the number of
   rooms it needs and for how long.
   10.22.2. In general, the traveler will pay the charges for contract quarters. Under the JTR,
   the traveler gets reimbursed for lodging costs, subject to ceilings for each geographic area.
   Record the cost against EEIC 409. Use EEIC 592 when the government pays the hotel or
   motel by check, whether using a separate service contract, blocking a number of rooms under
   an existing contract (BPA), or other agreement.
   10.22.3. For special categories of travel (e.g., formal training, exercises), commands and
   subordinate activities may continue to acquire contract quarters using procedures where the
   government pays the hotel directly. When using this method, installations may acquire the
   quarters through a separate service contract or by blocking a number of rooms under an
   existing local contract quarters agreement. Refer questions regarding the appropriate use of
   this method for financing contract quarters through command channels to SAF/FMBMM.
   The contract cost daily rate may not exceed the lodging rate, under the lodging-plus concept,
   for the local area as specified by the Joint Federal Travel Regulations or the Joint Travel
   Regulations.
   10.22.4. For JCS-directed exercises, all participating services (including Army, Navy,
   Marines, and the reserve components) in direct support of the air mission may use contract
   quarters. Table 10.3 identifies funding responsibilities. Charge costs to program element
   code (PEC) 28011.
   10.22.5. IMA Reserve personnel in a travel status performing inactive duty training period(s)
   are to pay for contract quarters. IMA Reservists, assigned to PAS Code 96XXXXXX, may
   use on-base government quarters or off-base government-contracted quarters during inactive
   duty for training (IDT). Lodging charges are reimbursed on the SF 1164 and submitted to the
   IMA travel office at Dobbins ARB for payment. A member in an inactive duty training status
   is to pay for contract quarters. IMA Reservists, assigned to PAS Code 96XXXXXX, may use
   on-base government quarters or off-base government-contracted quarters during inactive
   duty for training (IDT). For on-base quarters, the base billeting officer will process an SF
   1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal, for the necessary
   costs and forward to the AFO at Lowry AFB, CO, for reimbursement. For contract quarters,
   the IMA will pay for the quarters and send required documentation to HQ ARPC/ DROX for
   reimbursement through the Lowry FSO. In both cases, HQ ARPC will provide the funding
   using EEIC 409. DFAS-DE 7010.2-R and AFI 34-246 contain procedures.
   10.22.6. AFI 34-246, Table 1.1. provides specific billeting procedures; Rule 12 for IMAs
   and Rules 13, 14, and 15 apply to Unit assigned Reserve members. AFI 34-246, Paragraph
   1.17.3. covers housing for Reserve and ANG members during emergency and wartime
   operations such as Operation Desert Shield or Desert Storm.
 222                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   10.22.7. TWCF Aircrew Lodging. Air Force lodging offices administer no fund-type
   contracts with commercial hotels to support TDY personnel when on-base lodging facilities
   are not available or inadequate. AMCI (Air Mobility Command Instruction) 65-602, TWCF
   Budget Operations, Concepts, and Accounts, Chapter 2, identifies those applicable Air
   Force CONUS and overseas locations where TWCF funded aircrews may charge their on-
   base or contract lodging costs to local TWCF funds (Appn 97X4930.FD40). The
   Government-wide Purchase Card (GPC) is the payment mechanism used to charge the
   lodging costs of TWCF aircrews who fly airlift missions to/through these locations. Use
   EEIC 59270 to record TWCF aircrew lodging costs.

Section 10C—Medical Support

10.23. Financing Medical Support:
   10.23.1. Effective FY 93, use the Defense Health Program (DHP) appropriation (97*0130)
   to finance medical program costs, including operation and maintenance, procurement, and
   Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), but
   excluding RDT&E and personnel funds for active and reserve military medical personnel.
   Funds for medical facility military construction are in a single appropriation account.
   10.23.2. Record expenses of civil engineer and communications support provided to the
   medical program in PECs 886276 (OCONUS - 86376), 86278 (OCONUS - 86378), 87795
   (OCONUS - 87995) and 87779 (OCONUS - 87979). Charge expenses of health care services
   as follows: CONUS Medical centers, hospitals and clinics under PE 87700 (OCONUS -
   87900), care received in nondefense facilities in PE 87713 (except for supplemental and
   cooperative care which is charged to PEs 87700/ 87900), other health activities in PE 87714,
   military unique requirements in PE 87724, aeromedical evacuation system in PE 87725,
   military public health or occupational health PE 87705, veterinary services in PE 87760 and
   CONUS dental services in PE 87715 (OCONUS - 87915).
10.24. Executing the Medical Budget. The Air Force operates the DHP account for our non-
combat support medical activities. The Assistant Secretary of Defense, Health Affairs, prepares
and submits a unified medical program to provide resources for all medical activities within
DoD.
   10.24.1. OSD/Health Affairs, through TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), issues funds
   to AF/ SG, which then issues funds to MAJCOMs for distribution to medical treatment
   facilities (MTFs). The Air Force will continue to pay for applicable military personnel costs
   centrally using the Military Personnel appropriation. The Military Departments retain civilian
   medical personnel end strengths. To ensure proper accountability for civilian end strength
   utilization, each installation will pay medical civilian personnel using its own O&M account
   and receive reimbursement from the DHP operating appropriation.
   10.24.2. MAJCOMs, installations and medical activities program, budget and finance
   medical costs as provided for in DoD guidance and this instruction.
10.25. Expenses Chargeable to Medical Support. Except as indicated in paragraph 10.27,
charge all readily identifiable expenses incurred in operating and maintaining medical treatment
facilities to medical support (Defense Health Program, 97*0130). Apply the following guidance:

  charge salaries to the base support program element, then transfer the cost to the medical
  program element.
     10.25.1.1. Transfer the cost of direct labor, plus an appropriate percentage for Air Force
     civilians (per DFAS-DE 7010.2-R). Use gross labor costs for foreign nationals. Identify
     these amounts as contractual services in both program elements. This coding of the
     transfer maintains correlation between work-years and personnel funds each organization
     justifies and reports.
     10.25.1.2. If your base has a Work Information Management System (WIMS), charge
     the medical facility for civil engineering support based on standard shop rates rather than
     the above labor, benefits, and overhead.
     10.25.1.3. Immunizations/Inoculations for PCS moves and Deployments

  Military Public Health or Occupational Health (PE87705), Veterinary Services (PE 87760)
  and Dental Care Activities - CONUS (PE87715 or Dental Care Activities - OCONUS
  (PE87915).
     10.25.3.1. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Airlift in Support of Contingency
     Operations. In the event that a major contingency operation is declared by the President
     and SECDEF, AF/SG DHP funds will pay only those AE contingency airlift costs billed
     by TWCF from the first overseas fixed medical treatment facility (MTF) to the CONUS.
     When the President and SECDEF have formally withdrawn the contingency designation,
     entitlement to hostile fire pay ceases, military assignments are no longer based on
     rotational deployment taskings, and fixed MTFs are available, AF/SG DHP funds will

         supplies needed for PCS immunizations/inoculations.
         10.25.6.1.2. For Deployments. Immunizations/inoculations which take place on the
         installation, generally in the MTF, prior to deployment are funded by DHP. Supplies
         for immunization/inoculation, which are carried by deploying personnel for possible
         future use during the deployment, are funded with Line O&M (3400).
         10.25.6.1.3. For Exercises. Line O&M (3400) funds for all costs related to
         exercises, even medical supplies/immunizations required prior to deploying on the
         exercise.
  10.25.7. Laundry and Dry Cleaning. Charge services for hospital clothing and linens.

  initially finance services, transfer the charges to the medical program as a contractual service.
  10.25.8. Contract Maintenance. Charge all contractual costs to maintain medical and
  nonmedical equipment issued to a medical facility.
  10.25.9. Storage of War Readiness Materiel (WRM). You should generally charge the
  host installation's base operations program element for storage space, housekeeping, and
  maintenance costs for WRM storage. But if the space, facility, installation, or complex is
  solely for the medical program, charge the Defense Health Program.
  10.25.10. Autopsies. Autopsies are funded as follows:
      10.25.10.1. Autopsies performed in an MTF are funded with DHP funds.
      10.25.10.2. Autopsies performed by civilian pathologists, not employed by the Air
      Force, are funded with the O&M funds of the organization to which the deceased was
      assigned. If the deceased member was assigned to the MTF, DHP O&M would fund the
      autopsy.
      10.25.10.3. Autopsies performed on victims of a military aircraft accident, regardless of
      who performs the autopsy, will be funded with DHP funds.

Section 10I—Funding for Individual Clothing
 236                                             AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


10.55. Using O&M-Type Funds for Clothing Sales Store Charges. Installations may use
O&M-type funds to reimburse Clothing Sales Stores for the following categories of individual
clothing items (sales code 16, as explained in AFMAN 23-110, Volume I, Part three, Chapter 2).
   10.55.1. Burial of Deceased. Clothing sales issues made for burial of deceased military
   personnel whenever the uniform (except caps, shoes, or boots) of the deceased is not
   presentable enough to warrant its use. (See AFI 34-242.)
   10.55.2. Prevention of Disease and Medical Treatment. Clothing sales issues that a
   medical officer authorizes for the following conditions:
       10.55.2.1. Sales to enlisted members to replace clothing destroyed to prevent spread of
       contagious disease.
       10.55.2.2. Sales of items required during or immediately following medical care when
       the clothing items have been previously altered so as to prevent their use by the
       individual after treatment.
   10.55.3. Discharged Prisoners and Prisoners in Nonpay and Allowance Status. The unit
   commander may determine the minimum necessary personal clothing items for issue to
   discharged personnel in confinement who have been discharged, or who have had their
   discharge suspended or revoked but are in a non-pay and allowance status.
   10.55.4. Free Issue of Enlisted Grade Insignia. Installations may buy enlisted grade
   insignia for free issue to newly promoted enlisted military personnel (Table of Allowance
   (TA) 016B and AFMAN 23-110, Volume II, Part 2, Chapter 23). Treat these insignia
   purchases as a normal supply-type expense. Don't use O&M funds to buy officer insignia
   (TA 016).
   10.55.5. Rank Insignia and Accouterments on BDUs. Installations may                   use
   organizational O&M-type funds to sew on insignia and accouterments on enlisted personnel
   BDUs when enlisted members replace a ―damaged‖ (not serviceable) BDU. Do not use
   organizational funds to sew on the name tapes and accouterments to existing woodland
   BDUs or replacements due to normal wear and tear. Organizations may fund stripes for new
   promotees, but the individual pays for sewing on the stripes.
   10.55.6. Miscellaneous Clothing Sales. Clothing sales issues not otherwise categorized.
   (See AFMAN 67-1, volume I, part three, chapter 2.)
   10.55.7. Uniform Clothing Issued as Individual Equipment. Installations will use their
   organizational O&M-type funds to obtain required special uniforms (e.g., desert BDUs, flight
   suits, and other TA 016 uniforms which are not included as regularly issued uniforms which
   are paid by individuals from clothing allowance), as directed by their commanders or other
   competent authority. These uniforms and the matching stripes and accouterments are
   ―optional items directed wear.‖ The cost of any associated rank insignia, name tapes, and
   accouterments, as well as sewing on of these items on these uniforms, as required, may also
   be provided from organizational O&M-type funds at the discretion of the commander. This is
   applicable to officers and enlisted.
   10.55.8. Uniforms for Competition Participants. The use of appropriated funds to
   purchase new woodland BDUs and other clothing accessories funded by the member’s
   clothing allowance is not authorized. Only those items which are mission essential,
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             237


   authorized by a Table of Allowance, and not already provided for are to be procured for
   competition participants using appropriated funds. Initial issue provides all military
   personnel the clothing resources generally needed to meet occupational requirements and
   service members receive allowances for uniform upkeep and replacement due to normal wear
   and tear. While appearance is a vital part of a competition, military standards must be met for
   all military operational readiness and deployment exercises without the benefit of new
   clothing packages, excluding authorized special uniform requirements addressed in
   paragraph 10.55.7 above. Since woodland BDUs and other uniform items are routinely
   replaced by members, new sets could be purchased early to meet competition requirements.
   Personnel are entitled to replacement of military clothing damaged in competition per AFM
   67-1.
   10.55.9. Athletic/Exercise Clothing. Refer to Allowance Standard (AS) 016 available
   through the Air force Equipment Management System (AFEMS).

Section 10J—Funding Responsibilities for Organizational Clothing

10.56. Funding Distinctive Uniforms and Functional Clothing. Commanders may approve
these items for issue as organizational clothing if the functions of an organization or group
require the wear of these items (as authorized in AFI 36-2903). The Commander must put in
writing the justification for the uniform or clothing necessitating the expenditure of the
appropriated funds. Charge the cost of the distinctive uniforms, functional clothing and
authorized alterations to the unit of assignment's O&M-type funds. For the Air Force Reserve,
pay the expense from the Reserve Personnel, Air Force Appropriation. (Note: purchase of
organizational clothing is optional - commander's discretion.)
10.57. Financing the Introduction of New Clothing Items. The organization that originates
the requirement must provide initial funding for new clothing and textile items. A Military
Department with a new clothing item requirement must provide a funded order to the Defense
Logistics Agency (DLA) to cover the cost of acquisition of a balanced procurement cycle
quantity of the item. DLA won't order the item until the Air Force provides funds. "New items"
include initial introductions, a changes in use, or use by a new Military Service. Charge the
Military Personnel appropriation for new clothing bag items. Charge operating appropriations for
new organizational clothing items.

Section 10K—Unaccompanied Personnel Housing

10.58. Leasing Unaccompanied Personnel Housing. Charge lease to O&M funds when you
provide quarters (AFI 32-6005)
   10.58.1. Financing NonMilitary in Unaccompanied Personnel Housing (UPH). Credit

   contractor-provided curriculum development, course materials and initial cadre instruction.
   Apply this rule when the associated end item is in production or undergoing modification,
   and training is embedded in the production contract. (Use of investment accounts for factory
   training is effective in FY 1994.) Charge associated TDY costs for personnel attending this
   training to the O&M appropriation of the Command to which the personnel are assigned.
   10.59.2. Charge the O&M appropriation for:
       10.59.2.1. TDY of military members or civilian employees attending factory training
       courses.
       10.59.2.2. Factory training courses acquired by separate contract for end items no longer
       in production.
       10.59.2.3. Follow-on factory training.
   10.59.3. The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) is the sole procuring agency for
   factory training and will budget and fund for all TDY and contract costs for factory training
   that is chargeable to O&M.
   10.59.4. The Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and Air Force Space Command
   (AFSPC) for space related systems will budget and fund for contractor factory training and
   related TDY requirements supporting development, test, and evaluation (DT&E).
   10.59.5. HQ AFOTEC will program and budget for all contractor factory training and
   related TDY supporting initial operational test and evaluation (I0T&E) (see Chapter 14).
   AFMC and AFOTEC (through suballocation from AFMC), provide funds to AETC from
   RDT&E (57*3600) so AETC can execute factory training contracts supporting DT&E and
   IOT&E. (See AFI 36-2201.)

Section 10M—Lease or Rental of Equipment

10.60. Leasing or Renting Equipment. Air Force activities needing equipment should use the
contracting method (purchase, lease, rental) with the lowest life cycle cost. Use a method other
than lowest cost only in emergencies. If lease or rental is the most economical, apply this
guidance:
   10.60.1. Funding Lease or Rental Agreements. Charge the lease or rental expense to
   O&M-type funds (O&M, MFH Operations, DWCF, etc.). If a basic lease contract (i.e., it
   simply conveys the right to use equipment for 12 months or less) contains an option to
   renew, you may exercise the option annually, for up to 12 months at a time. As with other
   lease arrangements, title (and risk of loss) must remain with the lessor until the end of the
   final annual lease period.
       10.60.1.1. Lease With Option to Purchase (LWOP) and Lease to Ownership
       (LTO). These types of leases are governed by the Scoring Rules as written in OMB
       Circular A-11, Appendix B found on the web at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/. If
       you have questions after reading Appendix B of the Circular, contact SAF/FMBMM
       through your local Comptroller’s office to ensure that the budgeting and funding for these
       leases meet the criteria established in the OMB Circular.

       10.60.1.2. Obligating Lease or Rental Agreements. DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on
       Accounting for Obligations, provides criteria for recording obligations.

Section 10N—Land Purchases

10.61. Funding Minor Land Purchases. Use O&M-type funds to buy land (under 10 U.S.C.
2672 minor land purchase authority). The land must cost $500,000 or less and cannot be
associated with a specific MILCON project (P.L. 98-212, Section 707).
   10.61.1. The following is a chronology of the threshold for using O&M (3400) for minor
   land purchases:
 Fiscal Years                        O&M Threshold                      Public
 1997 to current                     $500,000                           P.L. 105-85
 1985 - 1996                         $200,000                           P.L. 99-167
 1980 - 1984                         $100,000                           P.L. 96-418
 1971 - 1979                         $50,000                            P.L. 92-145
 1962 - 1970                         $25,000                            P.L 87-651
 1958 - 1961                         $5,000                             P.L. 85-685
10.62. Funding Environmental Surveys of Land Interests Prior to Acquisition or
Disposal. The acquiring or disposing command will use its O&M-type funds (Environmental
Compliance, DERA or Base Closure accounts when applicable) to pay for initial environmental
surveys of land interests that the Air Force is considering disposing of or acquiring. Use project
funds when the environmental surveys relate to a funded MILCON project.
   10.62.1. Funding Environmental Non-Compliance Fines and Penalties (Federal Facility
   Compliance Act (FFCA)). Any civil penalty or fine levied against Air Force installations is
   the funding responsibility of that installation. Commanders will determine the specific
   internal funding realignments necessary to fund these costs. For accounting purposes, record
   payments for any fines or penalties to PE ***56f, EEIC 68410, 68420, 69440, and 68450 of
   the appropriation that bears responsibility (in accordance with Host/Tenant Support
   Agreements) at the affected installation. There is no withhold account to cover these costs --
   the bill will have to be paid out of existing current year resources. For additional guidance
   from Civil Engineering (AF/ILE), see AF/ILE 10 May 01 memorandum, Subject: Payment of
   Fines, Penalties, and Supplemental Environmental Projects.

Section 10O—Air Force Claims

10.63. Claims Payable From O&M Funds. Pay for claims (personnel, torts, admiralty, other)
with Air Force Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funds under Base Operating Support
Program Element XXX96, DODEE 18, and EEIC 672. (AFIs 51-501, Tort Claims, and 51-502,
Personnel and Government Recovery Claims, provide details of the programs.) These claims
include:
   10.63.1. Damages to personal property incurred during shipment or storage under contract
   with civilian carriers or warehouses.

   10.63.2. Repayment of erroneously collected amounts as determined by the Secretary
   concerned (or designated representatives) to military members and civilian personnel or to
   states, territories and the District of Columbia, or members of National Guard units.
   10.63.3. Payments for damages to persons or property caused by DoD personnel or
   activities.
10.64. Carrier Recoveries. Carrier recoveries will be credited to the O&M-type appropriation
current at the time of collection and be available for the same time period and purposes as that
appropriation (FY 99 Authorization Act, Section 1010 (P.L. 105-261) Codified in 10 U.S.C.
2739).

allowance for subsistence (BAS) to the MILPERS Appropriation.
   10.65.1. Funding Contract Feeding. Installations may contract for food service function.
   Charge service contracts to the O&M appropriation. If government facilities are not
   available, such as at a remote site, and if buying only meals, then installations may authorize
   feeding contracts and charge O&M.
   10.65.2. Reimbursement Procedures:
       10.65.2.1. Credit cash collections for meals served to personnel not authorized to subsist
       at government expense to the Military Personnel Appropriation. If the dining facility is
       contractor operated, credit the surcharge to O&M and the basic meal charge to the
       Military Personnel Appropriation.
       10.65.2.2. When you make arrangements for enlisted personnel to receive "subsisted-in-
       kind" from non-DoD agencies, obligate unit O&M funds and process reimbursements

                                            Chapter 11

                                   MANAGEMENT FUNDS

11.1. Purpose of Management Funds. A Management Fund is an account authorized by law
to credit collections from two or more appropriations or funds to finance an activity not
involving a continuing cycle of business-type operations. These accounts generally do not own a
significant amount of assets nor do they have a specified amount of capital provided (a corpus of
the fund). A management fund provides a means of interim financing and accounting for the
following:
   11.1.1. An operation or project that is financed by more than one appropriation or fund and
   whose costs cannot be distributed and charged to the financing appropriations or funds
   immediately; or
   11.1.2. An operation or project that is established pursuant to a transfer of functions
   involving two or more appropriations or funds under authority of law.
11.2. Purpose. A Management Fund:
   11.2.1. Is used only to finance operations whose costs are chargeable to appropriations or
   funds of the Air Force. Projects may encompass participation by organizational units of the
   Air Force only, or units of the Air Force and other DoD Components.
   11.2.2. May not be used to finance any activity that involves a continuing cycle of business-
   type operations, such as industrial or commercial type activities, or to purchase materiel for
   stock. The DoD uses revolving funds (now under the Defense Working Capital Fund,
   DWCF) to finance industrial or commercial type activities, and stock funds (now DWCF) to
   finance the acquisition of consumable (expense-type) materiel for stock. It may be used,
   however, to finance the purchase of materiel for use of an operation or project financed with
   a management fund.
   11.2.3. Will not be used to finance a new operation or project, even though eligible under
   paragraph 11.2.1, above, if other effective and efficient financing techniques are available.
   Charges are permitted to be made against an appropriation temporarily, if necessary, with an
   accounting adjustment to the appropriation or fund finally to be charged. (See P.L. 89-473
   and OMB Circular A-34).
   11.2.4. Is subject to periodic audits.
11.3. Responsibilities:
   11.3.1. SAF/FM shall:
       11.3.1.1. Ensure that a management fund is established or continued only when there is
       no other effective and efficient financing technique available to accomplish the proposed
       operation or project.
       11.3.1.2. Review and evaluate proposed management fund charters or amendments and
       recommend to the DoD Comptroller (DoD(C)) the establishment or continuance of a
       management fund account.
   11.3.2. The Secretary of the Air Force shall:
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                          243


      11.3.2.1. Propose use of a management fund as a financing technique, when considered
      appropriate, per guidance contained in this chapter.
      11.3.2.2. Oversee compliance with these instructions regarding its provision for
      budgeting, financing, accounting, and reporting for management fund accounts in use by
      the Air Force.
11.4. Procedures:
   11.4.1. Approval of Charters and Management Fund Accounts. Management Funds
   shall have a separate administrative account, called a management fund account, for each
   operation or project that it finances. SAF/FM submits a proposed charter to the DoD(C) for
   final approval (see Figure 11.1), with an explanation of the reasons for the use of the
   management fund as the means of financing the operation or project.
      11.4.1.1. SAF/FM prepares the proposed charter in the uniform format shown in Figure
      11.1, with an original and three copies over the signature of the Secretary, Under
      Secretary, or an Assistant Secretary of the Air Force. When appropriations or funds of
      more than one DoD Component are to share in the financing of a proposed account, each
      Component comptroller (or an equivalent official) must provide his or her concurrence.
      11.4.1.2. Using activities shall not exceed the scope of operations of a management fund
      account, as prescribed in the charter. However, the DoD Component can seek to revise
      basic provisions of a charter by submitting a proposed charter amendment in the same
      manner as an original charter application.
   11.4.2. Discontinuance of a Management Fund Account. When a management fund
   account is to be discontinued, SAF/FM submits a termination notice to the DoD(C) stating
   the reason for discontinuing the account and the estimated date of final liquidation.
   11.4.3. Budgeting, Financing, Accounting, and Reporting:
      11.4.3.1. Budgets and Financial Plans:
          11.4.3.1.1. The Air Force, through SAF/FMB, prepares annual budget estimates for
          each management fund per DoD 7000.14 –R, Financial Management Regulation.
          11.4.3.1.2. The managing activity for each management fund account prepares an
          annual operating budget or financial plan and updates it quarterly in a format
          appropriate for management planning and control purposes. The managing activity
          submits a copy of the operating budget or financial plan for an operation or project
          with the request for approval of an account charter. The managing activity also
          furnishes copies of operating budgets or financial plans to participating DoD
          Components or their organizational subdivisions when required for purposes of
          obtaining advances or for guidance in estimating appropriation or fund requirements.
      11.4.3.2. Financing and Administrative Control of Funds:
          11.4.3.2.1. Reimbursable orders, either with or without advances, whichever may be
          appropriate, provide the basis for obligation authority for the conduct of operations
          under a management fund account. The reimbursable orders may be issued in
          periodic increments to lessen the administrative workload and they will specify the
          accounting classifications to be used for billing purposes.
   244                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


             11.4.3.2.2. For fiscal control, the management fund is subject to DoD 7000.14-R,
             Vol. 14, Administrative Control of Funds and Antideficiency Act Violations.
             Obligations may not be incurred against a management fund that is not chargeable to
             a specific order and the appropriation or fund supporting that order.
          11.4.3.3. Billing and Payment:
             11.4.3.3.1. Management fund outlays are charged to appropriations or funds as
             prescribed in the account charter and specified in the reimbursable order.
             11.4.3.3.2. Accomplish billings and payments by use of SF 1081, Voucher and
             Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits. When financing is by means of advances,
             the advances are made by SF 1081 prepared and processed as of the beginning of the
             period covered by the advance. In all cases, however, the Air Force activity
             responsible for the management fund account shall submit monthly bills to
             participating organizations to permit them to charge appropriate accounts and record
             the reduction in the advance accounts, as well as to permit the managing Air Force
             activity or other DoD Component to adjust its own accounts.
          11.4.3.4. Accounting and Reporting. The supporting financial management office will
          classify financial transactions under each management fund account in enough detail to
          meet management planning and control requirements. The principles, standards, and
          requirements in DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 4 apply to the accounting and reporting systems.
          This manual provides for the recording and reporting of the source, application, and
          status of funds. The management fund account charters must contain additional financial
          reporting needed by participating organizations for management purposes; the financial
          reporting must conform to DoD Directive 5000.19, Policies for the Management and
          Control of Information Requirements.

       12.3.3.2. Interprets mission impacts caused by reductions or budgetary impact changes to
       the PCS program.
       12.3.3.3. Manages PCS operational, rotational, unit moves, and reimbursables during
       budget execution.
12.4. Complying with Statutory Entitlements. The MILPERS appropriation is basically a
statutory entitlement appropriation. Most costs borne by the MILPERS appropriation can't be
avoided or deferred as long as the member continues in service. Once on board, the Air Force
must:
   12.4.1. Pay military personnel at statutory rates.
   12.4.2. Honor increases resulting from length of service.
   12.4.3. Pay appropriate allowances for quarters, in amounts that vary by pay grade, when
   members aren't furnished public quarters.
12.5. Budgeting and Funding for Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Movements. Apply
this paragraph in funding for transportation of household goods (HHG) and travel of military
personnel under special circumstances. SAF/FMB budgets for PCS moves. See AFMAN 65-604
for detailed project and subproject codes.
   12.5.1. Individual Moves:
       12.5.1.1. Command-Directed Moves. Charge costs to applicable CMA accounts in the
       military personnel appropriation. Command directed moves include:
          12.5.1.1.1. Moves of assigned personnel directed according to AFI 36-2110,
          Assignments, and related instructions.
          12.5.1.1.2. Overseas extensions of individuals remaining under the same command
          jurisdiction. (See AFI 36-2110)

         Force instructions.
         12.5.1.2.2. Assignment and reassignment of all general officers.
  12.5.2. Unit Moves:
      12.5.2.1. Command-Directed. See AFI 16-403, Program Management of Installations
      and Units Data and Movement of Units, regarding command authority for directed
      movements of organized units. Charge the cost of individuals moving with the units to
      CMA PCS funds.
      12.5.2.2. HQ USAF-Directed:
         12.5.2.2.1. HQ USAF directs all unit moves, except units referenced in AFI 16-403.
         12.5.2.2.2. Charge the CMA for the PCS costs of individuals under a HQ USAF-
         directed unit move.
         12.5.2.2.3. You may only cite the HQ USAF-directed CMA funds for personnel
         actually assigned or to be assigned to authorized positions in the unit to be moved
         before the movement date. Reference the HQ USAF unit move directive in the orders
         you issue for fund citation. Exclude:
         12.5.2.2.4. Personnel filling vacancies at the new location as a result of requisition
         and levy procedures.
         12.5.2.2.5. Reassignments from schools.
         12.5.2.2.6. Persons returning from overseas tours.

         life.
         12.5.2.2.8. Cite command-directed CMA funds for moves after the effective date of
         the unit move.
         12.5.2.2.9. In programming unit moves, HQ USAF (Director of Personnel Force
         Management) must estimate the number of individuals involved in the move,
         including those needed to support units at new locations. Show this data in the
         program document's (PD) summary of unit movements. Command requests to issue
         movement directives must not include personnel moves exceeding those authorized.
         For move requirements exceeding the number programmed, Commands must provide
         detailed justification in the movement request and financial plans.
      12.5.2.3. Notification. The command must notify SAF/FMBOP, Washington DC
      20330-1130 (info to AFPC/DPMYE/DPMPPP, Randolph AFB, Texas 78150-6001) of
      the number of individual officer and enlisted moves accomplished within 15 days after
      completing a unit move. SAF/FMBOP uses this data to validate obligations.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                          249


  12.5.3. Delayed Movement of Dependents or Household Goods (HHG). Movement of
  dependents or HHG may occur after another PCS order has been issued. (See JFTR, Volume
  1, Paragraphs U5222 Con D.) When this occurs, determine the chargeable fiscal year by the
  transfer effective date (TED) shown in the PCS orders.
     12.5.3.1. When assignment is to an overseas area where dependents may accompany
     sponsor, but movement of dependents is delayed until after new PCS orders are issued
     reassigning the sponsor to another overseas location, charge the PCS to the funds cited in
     the PCS orders covering the sponsor's first overseas assignment.
     12.5.3.2. When assignment is to an overseas area where dependents may not accompany
     the sponsor, and the sponsor is later reassigned to another overseas location where
     dependents are permitted, charge the costs related to moving the dependents to the new
     location to the funds cited in the PCS orders covering the sponsor's latest assignment.
     12.5.3.3. When military members, civilian employees, and other persons travel under
     competent orders as escorts or attendants for dependents of members of the service, cite
     the O&M appropriation for travel and transportation allowances. (Reference JFTR, part
     Q, U7550, U7551, U7552, and U7553.) Pay the dependents' travel and transportation
     allowances from the Military Personnel Appropriation's PCS account, using the member's
     PCS fund cite.
  12.5.4. Advance Return of Dependents to Continental United States (CONUS). When
  orders authorize the advance return of dependents, cite the funds that would have been cited
  on the member's PCS orders. For example, if the actual transfer effective date (TED) of the
  member is a different fiscal year (FY) than the dependents' relocation date, you should code
  the subproject code of the fund cite to link the dependents' travel back to the member's TED.
  Do this by using a ".9" instead of ".0" in the subproject element of the fund cite (see
  MILPERS appropriation guidance in AFMAN 65-604). To determine the fund citation, see
  guidance on directing PCS moves in AFI 36-2110.
  12.5.5. Rules for PCS Moves that Overlap More than One Project or
  Subproject. Project and subproject codes distinguish among the major types of PCS moves
  and generally coincide with the categories used for PCS move programming. When PCS
  moves fall under more than one budget project, or subproject, apply these rules:
     12.5.5.1. The centrally managed allotment (CMA) for travel to and from overseas takes
     precedence over the CMA for training, PCS moves. For example, you charge a PCS from
     an Air Force school to an overseas assignment to CMA "travel to and from overseas"
     rather than "training travel."
     12.5.5.2. The CMA for PCS moves to or from formal training schools takes precedence
     over the CMA for reassigning PCS moves within CONUS.
     12.5.5.3. For PCS costs for individuals separating from the service, cite the CMA for
     separation travel:
     12.5.5.4. When an individual serving in a CONUS station is ordered to another station
     for processing incident to separation prior to issuing the PCS order, charge the resulting
     TDY costs to the operation and maintenance (O&M) funds supporting the command of
     assignment.
250                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


      12.5.5.5. When the last permanent duty station is overseas and the member is returned to
      CONUS for separation, charge all travel, transportation, and nontemporary storage costs
      to separation travel.
      12.5.5.6. Charge costs associated with members accompanied by dependents to the
      United States between consecutive overseas tour (COT) areas to the MILPERS
      (57*3500) appropriation whenever new PCS orders are written and a move ensues. Also,
      charge the MILPERS (57*3500) appropriation when the member stays at the present duty
      station and there is no physical move.
  12.5.6. Transporting Passengers, Unaccompanied Baggage and HHG, on Aircraft
  Operated by Air Mobility Command Under the Transportation Working Capital Fund
  (TWCF). SAF/FMB manages the CMA accounts that cover the TWCF airlift part of PCS
  travel expenses.
  12.5.7. Military Sealift Command (MSC) and Military Traffic Management Command
  (MTMC). Charge the appropriate CMA accounts for TWCF transportation services (MSC
  and MTMC) and overseas port terminals. This includes:
      12.5.7.1. All costs of transportation services furnished by MSC for military personnel on
      Air Force duty, their dependents, HHG, personal baggage, and privately owned
      automobiles (POVs).
      12.5.7.2. Transportation Services furnished by Army Port Terminals (CONUS) and
      overseas port terminals, including baggage handling charges for passengers embarking or
      debarking from MSC vessels, port handling charges for HHG, and port handling charges
      connected with shipment of POVs. See DFAS Interim Guidance on Accounting for
      Obligation (formerly DFAS-DE 7000.4-R and AFR 170-8) Paragraph 13, for recording
      PCS travel obligations.
  12.5.8. Household Goods (HHG) Shipments. The transportation officer initiating the
  shipment is responsible for determining the mode of shipment. Charge the CMA account
  cited in the PCS orders authorizing the shipment for all costs incident to shipping HHG,
  including contract packing and crating and other accessorial services. Except: follow
  paragraph 12.5.6 and 12.5.7 for transportation services furnished by MSC, Army port
  terminals, overseas port terminals or Air Mobility Command.
  12.5.9. Nontemporary Storage of HHG. Costs of nontemporary storage include line haul
  charges to the storage facility, charges for accessorial services connected with the storage
  (see JFTR, Vol 1, Paragraph U5380A), actual storage, and handling out charges to the
  warehouse docks.
      12.5.9.1. Charge storage expenses to the appropriation current in the fiscal year when
      services are provided.
      12.5.9.2. Charge the cost of nontemporary storage of HHG in commercial facilities
      resulting from PCS movement of military personnel (see JFTR, Volume 1, Paragraph
      U5380) to the CMA account prescribed for this purpose.
      12.5.9.3. When HHG are at an overseas location and are returned to CONUS for storage,
      charge the cost of overseas shipment and storage to the CMA for rotation moves from
      overseas.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                           251


  12.5.10. Dislocation Allowance. Charge the cost to the CMA account cited in the PCS
  movement orders. (A dislocation allowance is authorized to partially reimburse a member for
  expenses incurred in relocating HHG upon a PCS (see JFTR, volume 1, part G). The cost of
  dislocation allowance is part of the total PCS movement.)
  12.5.11. Mobile Home Allowance. Charge the cost to the CMA account cited in the PCS
  movement orders. (A mobile home allowance is authorized to reimburse a member for the
  cost of transporting a mobile home (JFTR, volume 1, part F).)
  12.5.12. Reimbursable Transportation Expenses:
     12.5.12.1. Some PCS moves result from requests of other federal agencies, governments,
     or international organizations under agreements requiring reimbursement for all or part of
     the travel and transportation costs to the MILPERS appropriation. Charge these costs to
     budget project accounts covering reimbursable PCS expenses (doesn't apply to Foreign
     Military Sales reimbursable costs). DFAS-DE/WFR administers this account.
     12.5.12.2. To determine whether military PCS costs are reimbursable, orders issuing
     activities must consider agreements with other federal agencies, governments, or
     international organizations. For example, only the travel expenses of the military member
     are reimbursable upon assignment to a United Nations mission. Therefore, travel orders
     directing these moves must cite the Air Force reimbursable budget account for travel of
     the member only. Charge the cost of travel of dependents and shipment of HHG to and
     from overseas to the Air Force allotment that applies (see DFAS-DE Regulation 177-29).
     12.5.12.3. Under the Mansfield Amendments, payments for wages are paid directly to
     the United States government. Credit these collections to the MILPERS appropriation.
     Charge PCS costs of persons being reassigned for this duty to the CMA for movements to
     and from overseas. If the host country pays for PCS costs of mission members, travel of
     dependents, and shipment of HHG, credit the collections to the MILPERS appropriation.
     12.5.12.4. Follow DFAS-DE Regulation 177-29 to identify reimbursable costs and
     collect for items included in MSC billings.
     12.5.12.5. Follow this paragraph for PCS costs related to FMS programs.
         12.5.12.5.1. Military personnel PCS costs related to FMS cases are reimbursable.
         Finance the costs with FMS funds, unless the case is funded with MAP funds or non-
         repayable FMS credits (DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 15, Section 070203.
         12.5.12.5.2. Composite standard pay rates include PCS costs and are subject to
         acceleration factors. Reimbursable FMS positions receive payment for PCS moves as
         a component of this composite standard pay rate. When military personnel must make
         a PCS move to support an FMS case, delete the PCS rate from the composite rate and
         charge the actual PCS cost to the case. In the latter situation, the actual PCS cost is
         not subject to acceleration.
  12.5.13. PCS to Air Force Academy (USAFA) Preparatory School. Charge the PCS cost
  of Air Force personnel selected to attend the USAFA Preparatory School, Army Military
  Academy Preparatory School, or Naval Academy Preparatory School to the MILPERS
  appropriation (57*3500). Army and Navy appropriations must pay associated PCS costs for
252                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


  Army and Navy enlisted personnel selected to attend the USAFA Preparatory School.
  Include this guidance in any instructions you issue to Army and Navy installations .
  12.5.14. Travel From Overseas to CONUS in Connection With Emergency Leave. PCS
  moves may arise as the result of emergency leave granted under AFMAN 177-373, volume
  II. Treat these PCS moves as command-directed if the reassignment to the CONUS unit
  would otherwise have been command-directed. See paragraph 10.18 for funds to cite when
  a member is placed on TDY for return to CONUS on TWCF flights on a space required
  basis.
  12.5.15. TDY Travel in Connection With PCS Movement:
      12.5.15.1. TDY Costs Chargeable to the MILPERS Appropriation. Charge TDY
      travel costs directly related to PCS moves to the MILPERS PCS account only if all of the
      following conditions are met:
         12.5.15.1.1. TDY doesn't exceed 15 days and is performed enroute to a new PCS
         station.
         12.5.15.1.2. TDY is for medical examinations, M16 rifle training, obtaining
         passports and in-processing at host base (when required under host/tenant agreement).
         No training other than M-16 is authorized in TDY status. Charge TDY for briefings,
         debriefings, and special instructions to the requiring command's O&M-type funds.
         12.5.15.1.3. If PCS is HQ USAF-directed, TDY must be authorized by HQ AF
         AFSLMO/CA for colonels, and by HQ AFPC/PPAPP for other officers (lieutenant
         colonel and below) and enlisted personnel. If PCS is command-directed, the
         MAJCOM/DPA AFPC must approve the TDY according to DFAS-DE 7010.3.R.
      12.5.15.2. TDY Costs Not Chargeable to the MILPERS Appropriation:
         12.5.15.2.1. Charge TDY requirements, other than those in paragraph 12.5.15.1, to
         O&M-type funds according to paragraph 10.3.4. Include the fund citation in the
         PCS order. This includes TDY travel for formal or informal training conducted by the
         Air University, MAJCOMs, HQ USAF staff agencies, or other government agencies.
         12.5.15.2.2. But, transoceanic travel costs associated with directed TDY to CONUS
         incident to PCS are considered a PCS expense. Charge the cost to the applicable PCS
         funds (see paragraph 10.3 for details.) Use the military personnel appropriation
         current on the transfer effective date to finance the cost of the military member's
         travel from the TDY station to a new permanent station and the cost of a dependent's
         travel from the old to the new permanent station.
      12.5.15.3. Movement on Indefinite/Indeterminate TDY. HQ USAF specifically
      authorizes movements of individuals or organizations to overseas commands on
      indefinite TDY. Charge expenses to the budget subproject of the MILPERS
      appropriation. When authorized by HQ USAF, you will also charge the travel of
      dependents and transportation of HHG within the United States. Refer to JFTR V1, par.
      U4605.
  12.5.16. Fiscal Year (FY) Chargeable for PCS Moves:
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             253


      12.5.16.1. All PCS orders contain a transfer effective date (TED). Charge the PCS to the
      FY that coincides with the TED. (PCS travel requests for entry on or separation from
      active duty don't contain a TED; determine the date chargeable from the date of entry on
      active duty or date of separation.)
      12.5.16.2. Be careful not to cite a subsequent FY appropriation because the authority to
      obligate subsequent year funds depends on congressional approval given in the annual
      appropriation acts. When a TED falls in a subsequent FY, use a 9 code with the current
      appropriation (see DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Procedures for Travel Accounting
      Operations.
      12.5.16.3. See AFMAN 36-2125 to compute transfer dates.
12.6. Travel of Indigent Army, Navy, and Air Force Enlisted Personnel:
   12.6.1. Enlisted Personnel Not Traveling Under Official Orders. Army, Navy, and Air
   Force enlisted personnel not traveling under official orders and not entitled to transportation
   at government expense may be issued meal tickets and transportation requests (TRs)
   according to applicable directives. Charge appropriations as follows:
      12.6.1.1. Army Enlisted Personnel. Army enlisted personnel may be advanced cash in
      an amount equivalent to the meal tickets. Charge the project that applies under the
      MILPERS appropriation, Army, for TRs, meal tickets, and cash advance. Army
      authorities will obtain reimbursement from the individual for these expenses.
      12.6.1.2. Navy Enlisted Personnel. The Navy Department doesn't desire to have their
      personnel advanced cash in place of meal tickets. Charge the MILPERS appropriation,
      Navy, for TRs and meal tickets. Navy authorities obtain reimbursement from the
      individual for these expenses.
      12.6.1.3. Air Force Enlisted Personnel. Air Force enlisted personnel may be advanced
      cash in amount equivalent to the meal tickets. Obtain reimbursement from the individual
      for these expenses according to AFI 24-101, Passenger Travel.
   12.6.2. Enlisted Personnel Traveling Under Official Orders. Enlisted personnel (when
   traveling under official orders issued by their respective services) may be eligible for TRs
   and meal tickets. Cite the appropriation of the respective military service, as shown on the
   travel orders, for the TRs and meal tickets.
12.7. Other Military Personnel Costs. Charge the Air Force CMA Account (P-591.02) for:
   12.7.1. Return of absentees, deserters or escaped prisoners.
   12.7.2. Payment of rewards and reimbursement for apprehension, detention and delivery of
   absentees, deserters, and escaped prisoners.
   12.7.3. Travel of guards after the member is identified as a deserter by the parent
   organization.
   12.7.4. Return of Absentees, Deserters, or Escaped Military Prisoners. The Air Force
   may furnish military personnel who are in an absent-without-leave, desertion, or escaped
   military prisoner status (under apprehension) the necessary transportation and meal tickets to
   return to their duty station or another place directed by competent authority. The travel and
   expenses of the apprehended member are funded by the Military Personnel CMA account.
 254                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   The travel and expenses of an escort to bring the apprehended member to a military
   installation is funded IAW with paragraph 12.8 below. See paragraph 12.7.5 for the
   payment of rewards and reimbursements for the return of apprehended members. If
   transportation and meal tickets are furnished for an apprehended member from another
   military department, charge the cost to the appropriation of the appropriate military
   department (that is, MILPERS, Army, Navy, or Marines). After a military member has been
   initially apprehended and returned to a military installation, further travel is funded IAW AFI
   31-205, The Air Force Corrections System, Chapter 9, Paragraph 9.9.
   12.7.5. Payment of Rewards and Reimbursements for Apprehension, Detention and
   Delivery of Absentees, Deserters, Parole Violators, and Escaped Prisoners. Per AFI 36-
   2911, Desertion and Unauthorized Absence, Chapter 3, Paragraph 3.5., any authorized
   communication, oral or written, from a military or federal law enforcement official or
   agency, requesting active cooperation in apprehending or delivering to military control an
   absentee or deserter wanted by a military department constitutes the basis for a reward. After
   this communication, the Air Force rewards or reimburses (but not both) persons or agencies
   apprehending, detaining or delivering absentees, deserters, escaped military prisoners, or
   parole violators to military control under Air Force CMA account 591.02. If a non-Air Force
   military absentee/deserter/escapee is brought to an Air Force installation and a reward or
   reimbursement is due, the apprehendee’s parent military department military personnel
   account pays, not the Air Force CMA. See DFAS-DE 7010.2-R, Chapter 21, Paragraph 21-
   33.f.
   12.7.6. Confinement in a Civilian Jail Pending Movement to a Military Confinement
   Facility. If confinement in a local civilian jail is required because there are no military
   confinement facilities on an installation, the cost of confinement is chargeable to the
   operating funds of that installation. It is NOT chargeable to the MILPERS (3500)
   appropriation.
12.8. Travel of Guards:
   12.8.1. Charge transportation requests (TRs) and meal tickets furnished to Air Force
   personnel acting as escorts of Air Force absentees, deserters, parole violators, and escaped
   military prisoners to the Air Force CMA account P-591.03. Don't charge these expenses
   against the pay of the Air Force returned member.
   12.8.2. When Air Force escorts return Army personnel from an Air Force installation, charge
   the TRs and meal tickets furnished to the escorts to the MILPERS appropriation, Army.
   Obtain the full Department of Army accounting classification from Army fiscal codes, the
   nearest Army installation, Army headquarters, or the home organization of the Army
   absentees, deserters, or escapees.
12.9. Participation of USAFR and ANG Units in Regular Air Force Exercises (MPA Man-
Day Program). To determine whether to finance charges for personnel participation from the
Air Force MILPERS appropriation or from Reserve Personnel, Air Force, or the National Guard
Personnel, Air Force appropriations, apply the following rules:
   12.9.1. If the purpose is to fulfill active duty Air Force requirements, charge the pay and
   allowances to the MILPERS, Air Force appropriation. Charge travel and per diem costs to
   the O&M-type funds of the active duty Air Force organization being supported.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            255


   12.9.2. If the purpose is to fulfill ANG or USAFR training requirements, charge the costs to
   the reserve component personnel appropriation. For example, early commissioning of
   medical and dental officers is a program to fulfill training requirements of the USAFR, and
   you would charge pay and allowances and other costs to the USAFR appropriation.
   12.9.3. You may mix resources (man-days and travel costs) between active and reserve
   forces component appropriations under circumstances where it's clearly beneficial to the total
   force and agreeable to both the reserve component unit providing the support and the active
   Air Force command requesting the support.
12.10. Nontemporary Storage Charges. Pay nontemporary storage charges incident to PCS
from annual appropriations and from the fiscal year when the storage services are rendered. See
the Air Force PCS orders for the CMA fund citation. See AFH 24-502 for guidance on
nontemporary storage entitlements.
12.11. Reimbursements for Military Personnel Services. See paragraph 5.4.4 and Chapter
18, DWCF.
12.12. The Subsistence Program. Charge the cost of basic allowance for subsistence (BAS) to
the MILPERS Appropriation. Finance subsistence-in-kind for Air Force active duty personnel
from the Military Personnel (57*3500) Appropriation. Finance subsistence-in-kind for Air
National Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel from the Air National Guard personnel
(57*3850) and the Air Force Reserve personnel (57*3700) accounts. See Chapter 10, Section
10P, for further details.
12.13. Emergency Evacuation Allowances. 37 U.S.C. 405a authorizes the payment of
emergency evacuation allowances when the Secretary of the Air Force, a designee, or other
competent authority directs or approves the evacuation of dependents. Charge all authorized
allowances to the MILPERS appropriation. For specific entitlements and rates, see the Joint
Federal Travel Regulations. See AFMAN 65-604, PCS budget projects 5710 and 5810, for
correct subproject coding.
12.14. Consecutive Overseas Tours. See paragraph 4.39 for guidance on paying roundtrip
travel expenses for military personnel and their dependents from overseas to the CONUS
between consecutive overseas tours (COTs).
12.15. Housing Moves at a Permanent Duty Station (PDS) for Government
Convenience. A Partial Dislocation Allowance (PDLA) of $500.00 must be paid to a member
who is ordered to occupy/ vacate Government family-type quarters due to: a) privatization, b)
renovation, (c) any reason other than PCS (JFTR , Paragraph U5630-B15). Payment is made
from the Military Personnel Appropriation. If an AF Form 150 is completed by the Housing
Office for a move and the Government pays for that move, the member is entitled to a PDLA
payment. The one DLA per fiscal year limitation does not apply to partial DLA (JFTR,
Paragraph U5620-A). These changes were effective 9 February 2002.
   12.15.1. Expenses for Reconnection of Phones and Cable in Unaccompanied
   Housing. Members who are directed to move from one unaccompanied billet to another for
   the convenience of the Government will receive reimbursement for reconnection of
   telephones and cable TV. This reimbursement will be paid from O&M (3400). PDLA is
   NOT authorized for moves between unaccompanied housing billets.

  12.15.2. Additionally, military members temporarily displaced from base housing as a result
  of programmed renovations/upgrades or emergency situations which require occupants to
  vacate quarters as determined by the installation Commander, receive reimbursement for
  temporary lodging expenses that exceed BAH rates. Upon submission of SF 1164, Claims for
  Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business, base O&M (3400) funds should be
  used to reimburse the occupants for housing expenses exceeding the BAH entitlement
  amount (AF/ILE Memo 9 Jul 02, Reimbursement for Costs Incurred by Personnel Displaced
  from Family Housing) (Comptroller General Decisions B-213293 and B-225205).

                        APPROPRIATION (57*3600)

Section 13A—General Guidance

13.1. Using RDT&E Categories. The RDT&E appropriation consists of the mission program
and the management and support program.
   13.1.1. Use the Mission Program to budget and fund for all RDT&E work under contract
   with private industry, educational institutions, federal contract research centers, and other
   government agencies, as well as for Air Force work.
   13.1.2. Use the Management and Support Program to budget and fund for operating and
   maintaining R&D facilities and RDT&E work at Air Force facilities. See Chapter 4 and
   Chapter 10 for general funding guidance that applies to this program.
13.2. Applying the Uniform Budget Structure. MAJCOM and program offices will prepare
budgets by program element. SAF/AQ and FM use the budget structure prescribed by the Office
of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) for the President's Budget:

Table 13.1. RDT&E Budget Structure.

 Budget
 Program      Activity       Title
 610          1              Basic Research
 620          2              Applied Research
 630          3              Advance Technology Development
 640          4              Advanced Component Development and
                             Prototype (ACD&P)
 650          5              System Development and Demonstration (SDD)
 660          6              RDT&E Management Support
 670          7              Operational Systems Development
13.3. Managing RDT&E Funds. The Air Force manages RDT&E funds by program elements
(which are also the baseline for reprogramming) for the current and immediately preceding fiscal
years. In cases involving statutory or other congressional limitations, SAF/FMB may control
funds for projects or subprojects. New obligation authority expires after 2 fiscal years. You may
continue to apply available RDT&E funds for valid obligation adjustments and expenditures for
5 years after expiration under the original appropriation symbol. Maintain the same level of
detail for expired accounts as for current accounts. See Chapter 6 for guidance on using expired
and canceled accounts. Chapter 3 contains specific guidance on budget authorizations,
allocations, and allotments.
 258                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


13.4. Applying Incremental Programming and Financing for RDT&E. Follow the guidance
in DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 2A, Chapter 1.
   13.4.1. Limit reapplying of funds in the second year to cost growth within scope or to
   requirements which are a bona fide need of the appropriation year as defined by DFAS-DE
   Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations. Commands should identify funds above
   programmed requirements to be obligated in the first year to SAF/FMBIZ and SAF/AQXR,
   so the Air Force can reapply funds to other priority programs.
   13.4.2. MAJCOM Headquarters will control exceptions to incremental programming and
   financing during execution.
   13.4.3. Award fee requirements are planned and budgeted for as a part of the total weapon
   system cost. Award fees are a bona fide need of the same fiscal year and appropriation that
   finances the related effort on which the award fee is based. To comply with RDT&E
   incremental funding policy, award fee requirements must be budgeted for and funded with
   the same fiscal year funds as the increment of associated effort. Until the determination has
   been made that a contractor is due an award fee, the award fee funds are committed as
   a contingent liability, not obligated. (See DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 3, Chapter 8, Paragraph
   080202).
13.5. Delineating    Funding     Responsibility    Between      RDT&E       and    Procurement
Appropriations:
   13.5.1. See volume 2A, chapter 1, of DoD 7000.14-R, for guidance on the types of costs
   RDT&E and related appropriations finance. Also see Chapter 8 of this AFI.
   13.5.2. Normally, you should cite RDT&E and procurement funds on separate contracts.
   However, if that is not practical, you should specify separate tasks in the contract (contract
   line items) so you'll have documentation on contract accounts and voucher payments tied to
   specific appropriations.
   13.5.3. General Criteria: When, after consideration of the following criteria, there is doubt
   as to the proper assignment of costs between appropriations, the issue should be resolved in
   favor of using RDT&E funding (DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 2A, Chapter 1, Paragraph
   010212.B).
13.6. Family Housing. Do not use RDT&E to construct, operate, and maintain family housing
at R&D installations or activities.
13.7. Tenant Activities. See Chapter 7.
13.8. Managing Uncommitted and Unobligated Balances in RDT&E. Apply the following
to make sure approved R&D programs are timely and effective.
   13.8.1. HQ USAF may withdraw uncommitted balances at the end of the first year of
   availability.
   13.8.2. Finance validated current and first prior fiscal year cost increases within the program
   element of the approved program. If the approved program is insufficient, then request
   reprogramming within Air Force approval authority.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              259


   13.8.3. Finance validated cost increases for an expired year within the allocation for the
   multiple-year period. If funds are not available, the MAJCOM will ask SAF/FM for more
   money to cover the deficit. Follow procedures in Chapter 6.
   13.8.4. The RDT&E appropriation is legally available for up to 2 years for a new obligation
   and you may incur obligations at any time during the 2 years, if the related action concerns
   an item authorized in the program authorization and budget authorization (PA or BA)
   documents issued for the appropriation year. However, due to its nature, PMA should be
   budgeted on an annual basis and reflected in the fiscal year during which the requirement is
   projected to execute. The appropriation used to fund PMA should be consistent with the
   work being performed and not determined simply by prorating between available
   appropriations. During execution, emergent PMA requirements may be paid from any fiscal
   year currently available for new obligation provided the appropriation cited is consistent with
   the task being supported. Shortfalls in budgeted PMA requirements need to be paid from the
   same appropriation as originally budgeted for the effort. In addition, when termination of a
   program is directed by Congress, initiated by the Air Force, or directed by OSD, the most
   recent funds appropriated for that program shall be used first to fund those day-to-day
   operating requirements necessary to execute termination. If no current year funds were
   appropriated, prior year unexpired RDT&E funds shall be used for executing termination.
   This action does not require a waiver from SAF/FMBIZ.
   13.8.5. You may use management and support funds to finance deferred, nonrecurring,
   investment costs -- such as equipment purchases and facility projects by contract -- or any
   other deferred nonrecurring effort if:
      13.8.5.1. It is a bona fide need of the prior fiscal year.
      13.8.5.2. It is a proper charge to management and support funds.
      13.8.5.3. HQ AFMC approves this case.
13.9. Charging Cost Increases for Incrementally-Funded R&D Contracts:
   13.9.1. Incrementally funded RDT&E contracts are:
      13.9.1.1. Multiyear contracts that provide for requirements beyond one year, even
      though all funds to be obligated are not available at the time you sign the contract. In this
      case, the contract scope includes total requirements performed over a number of fiscal
      years. You initially obligate only the first year's requirements. In succeeding years, you
      fund and obligate succeeding annual contract requirements.
      13.9.1.2. Contracts that provide only for the requirements of the current fiscal year. In
      this case, the contract scope describes only the annual requirements. You amend these
      contracts each year by changing the scope to include requirements for later fiscal years.
      You obligate current year funds for each annual change in scope.
   13.9.2. Charge cost increases as follows:
      13.9.2.1. If the cost increase occurs within the scope of the basic contract or contract
      amendments, charge the cost to the same appropriation and fiscal year cited on the basic
      contract or amendment (even if expired).
 260                                                 AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       13.9.2.2. If the contract was incrementally funded and the increase is traceable to more
       than 1 fiscal year, prorate it accordingly. Base your proration among fiscal years on the
       relationship of the cost increase to the performance required under the basic contract,
       change order, or contract amendment -- either individually or in total. For example, a cost
       increase could relate to a specific amendment or accrue over the total period of
       performance. Evaluate each increase to determine the extent and need for proration. If the
       contractor's performance report provides this data, you may use it to do the proration.
13.10. Aircraft Engine Component Improvement. See DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 2A, Chapter 1.
13.11. Information Processing Equipment (IPE). See Chapter 4 , Section 4B.
13.12. Value Engineering. See Chapter 8.
13.13. Factory Training. See Chapter 10, Section 10L.
13.14. General Use Vehicles for Research and Development (R&D) Activities. See Chapter
8.

Section 13B—Funding to Acquire Research and Development (R&D) Facilities and Install
R&D Equipment

13.15. Acquiring Facilities with RDT&E Funds. Generally, you must use MILCON to
acquire facilities at government-operated R&D installations and activities. Don't use authorities
for constructing with RDT&E to substitute for authorization of military construction projects or
for authorization and appropriation of military construction funds. In particular, don't use
RDT&E funds to produce facilities on military installations primarily for long term military use.
You may use RDT&E funds for the following categories of construction.
   13.15.1. Test Facility. A structure or improvement that is itself the subject of a test or is at
   least partially destroyed or consumed during testing (i.e., the facility is itself a test article).
   An example would be an aircraft shelter being tested for its ability to withstand bomb
   impacts.
   13.15.2. Prototype Facility. A structure that is the first of its kind in terms of materials,
   application, and design. It may be either a small-scale model or a full-size structure or
   demonstration project, built solely to establish criteria for constructing follow-on facilities.
   13.15.3. Temporary Facility. A specialized structure used to support a specific RDT&E
   project of limited duration. Such facilities must be clearly temporary in construction (non-
   permanent, provisional, and easily dismantled) with few decorative treatments or facades.
   The cost of all such exterior treatments may not exceed 5% of the total acquisition cost for
   the structure. You must follow AFI 32-1021, Chapter 6, Relocatable Facilities in acquiring
   offices and warehouse space, facilities readily adaptable to such uses, and other structures
   having "general utility." You may only approve an RDT&E-funded temporary facility on a
   military installation for up to three years; remove it at the end of the project. MAJCOMs
   must obtain SAF/IEI approval (through HQ USAF/ILE and SAF/FMBI) of any waivers to
   the three-year removal policy .
   13.15.4. Unspecified Minor Construction (10 U. S.C. 2805). Use RDT&E for unspecified
   minor construction projects costing $750,000 or less. All unspecified minor construction
   must result in a complete and usable facility. Don't use incremental construction, which is the
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             261


  planned acquisition of or improvement to, for a real-property facility through a series of
  minor construction project. See AFI 32-1021 and AFI 32-1032.
  13.15.5. Facilities for Contractors. You may use RDT&E to acquire industrial and R&D
  facilities that contractors need to fulfill R&D contracts (as authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2353 and
  DoDD 4275.5, Acquisition and Management of Industrial Resources). Submit each project
  through AF/ILE to SAF/ IE for approval. Follow guidance in AFI 63-701, the Defense
  Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, DFARS 245.302-1, and HQ USAF supplements
  to the FAR. Don't use this authority to acquire facilities with general utility. ("General
  utility" means adaptable for uses other than the original purpose without alterations costing
  over $750,000. All offices and warehouse buildings have general utility.) You don't have to
  treat test and prototype facilities as having general utility simply because they may be used as
  warehouse space with only minor alterations.
     13.15.5.1. The contractor alone operates and maintains complex.
         13.15.5.1.1. Convenience of the government and unusual circumstances dictate using
         RDT&E funding instead of MILCON funding.
         13.15.5.1.2. The construction or improvement doesn't have general utility.
     13.15.5.2. The Air Force must comply with Congressional reporting requirements (10
     U.S.C. 2662) for facility projects submitted under 10 U.S.C. 2353 that involve real
     property acquisitions with a price or estimated value more than $200,000. Wait 30 days
     after Congressional notification before entering into these transactions.
     13.15.5.3. If the project isn't in the President's budget, submit it out-of-cycle to
     Congressional committees using the complete DD Form 1391 package, Military
     Construction Project Data, coordinated with AF/ILE and SAF/IE.
     13.15.5.4. Use military construction funds for any other type of on-base building for
     contractor use. Except as stated in paragraph 13.15.3 above, remove all buildings
     erected for contractor use with RDT&E funds when the contractor has no further use for
     them, unless continued use is authorized under guidance for Test and Prototype Facilities.
     13.15.5.5. Lease the military installation land (on which a contractor's buildings
     (including relocatables) will rest to the contractor for five years under 10 U.S.C. 2667.
     You may write a longer lease if it will promote national defense or is in the public
     interest. Charge a nominal rent when the land will help someone carry out a government
     contract. Charge a pro-rata ground rent for any non-government use. Base the ground rent
     on fair market value at the time non-government use begins. Under the lease, the
     government will retain the right to approve non-government use. When the facility costs
     more than $2 million, report to the Congress under 10 U.S.C 2662 before signing the
     lease, whether or not the fair-market ground rent exceeds the reporting threshold (now
     $200,000). The Air Force must always submit the report when the fair-market ground
     rent (regardless of the rent actually charged) exceeds the reporting threshold.
     13.15.5.6. Report real property facilities leased from a contractor(s) to Congress 30 days
     before signing the lease if the fair-market rental value of the property exceeds $200,000.
     Include a report on the facts concerning the proposed transactions.
 262                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       13.15.5.7. When you lease real property, report the lease to the Armed Services
       Committees under 10 U.S.C. 2662 if the fair-market value of the real property is more
       than $200,000, even though the purchase price may be less. If the contract charges
       nothing or less than fair-market value, you must get authority to acquire the property
       under current construction guidelines using fair-market value rather than price (see AFI
       32-9001).
       13.15.5.8. Don't use facilities constructed on base for use by contractors to house
       government activities(other than those funded out of military construction or minor
       construction funds). If the senior Air Force official responsible for the contract
       determines government people must occupy the contractor's facility to monitor contract
       performance and protect government interests, they can't occupy more than 25% of the
       available space. To exceed this 25% limit, you must get a waiver from SAF/IEI, or get
       minor construction funds or MILCON authorization and appropriations to pay a pro rata
       share of the cost of the facility, based on the space occupied.
       13.15.5.9. Under 10 U.S.C. 2353, the Air Force may enter into an R&D contract that
       furnishes the contractor (or allows the contractor to acquire or construct) RDT&E
       facilities and equipment on property not owned by the government. The facilities must be
       necessary to carry out the contract. Don't install or construct facilities that wouldn't be
       readily available or separable without unreasonable expense (on property not owned by
       the government) unless the contract contains:
          13.15.5.9.1. A provision to reimburse the government for the fair value of the
          facilities.
          13.15.5.9.2. An option for the government to acquire the underlying land.
          13.15.5.9.3. Or an alternative provision that protects the interests of the United
          States.
   13.15.6. Relocatable Building. You may use a relocatable building to satisfy a temporary
   requirement for RDT&E. (A relocatable building is designed and packaged to be readily
   moved, erected, disassembled, stored, and reused. Prefabricated buildings consisting of pre-
   cut, formed, and drilled materials that permit easy assembly, but which aren't designed for
   disassembly and relocation aren't relocatable buildings.) Don't use a relocatable structure
   bought with RDT&E funds longer than the project requires or three years, whichever is less.
   For use beyond three years, you must obtain a waiver from SAF/IEI, submitted through HQ
   USAF ILE and coordinated with SAF/FMBI. Fund site preparation, foundations, utilities,
   and other supporting construction costs under $750,000 according to (paragraph 13.15.4)
   EEIC 529. Include in your justification why the requirement is temporary and how you'll
   meet it after three years. Return the relocatable building to stock when no longer needed or
   after 3 years, whichever is less. Follow approval levels in AFI 32-1021, Chapter 6.
13.16. Installing R&D Equipment. The cost of installing equipment as an integral part of a
new RDT&E facility is construction. You must fund it as construction, except for motor
generator sets, security systems, and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), which always fall
under RDT&E or O&M. Equipment not readily severable from the facility is considered part of
the facility. Fund it from the appropriation used to construct the building. (Readily severable
means equipment which can be removed without destroying the equipment or changing the
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               263


building's basic structure or purpose.) However, in existing facilities, you may use RDT&E
funds to install, change, or relocate movable equipment for RDT&E activities. Do this only if the
action doesn't expand the facilities outer dimensions and is for one or more of these specific
requirements:
   13.16.1. Installing and relocating prefabricated interior screens, partitions, and dividers,
   mostly unattached; movable screens or detachable panels held in place by light braces, and
   screws readily removed without impairing either the panels, floors, walls, or ceilings. These
   devices, used to install equipment, don't go on the real property records. For cost categories
   and additional guidance, see AFI 32-8001.
   13.16.2. Installing false floors and platforms required only to support operating equipment.
   Use Chapter 4, Section 4B , Paragraph 4.5 for cost definition and additional guidance.
   13.16.3. Installing required shielding for electromagnetic radiating devices. (However,
   structural modifications, including new permanent partitions incident to the installation of
   shielding, are construction. Also, you must budget and fund all anechoic chambers, whose
   cost exceeds the statutory dollar limit for minor construction (now $750,000), from the
   MILCON appropriation.
   13.16.4. Temporarily removing and reinstalling parts of existing walls, roofs, utility systems,
   and appurtenances, to permit installation of equipment. This may involve rerouting or
   relocating systems and appurtenances but may not increase the physical outer dimensions.
   13.16.5. Installing special foundations, pits, pads, or slab-on-grade in facilities. Limit
   installations on floors other than slab-on-grade to bases needed to spread the load and secure
   equipment. Increasing the load-bearing capacity of these floors by additional or larger
   structural components is construction.
   13.16.6. Secondary utility work, needed to connect the equipment to utilities services
   already in the facility. This work lies between the utilities' primary entry or source within the
   structure and the equipment to be served; for example, from the existing main electrical
   service panel, or for equipment requiring primary voltage from the building primary bus.
   Include structural provisions (conduit or cavity runs) for known requirements in the project
   design to avoid later structural damage during installation after the fact.
13.17. Installing Air Conditioning. Use RDT&E:
   13.17.1. Only for equipment spaces directly related to the equipment and not in associated
   administrative or other work spaces. Projects for air conditioning of administrative or other
   work space are construction. When possible, use an extension or expansion of a central plant
   to provide air conditioning under these circumstances. This may include extending the duct
   work, direct expansion systems, or the chilled water systems by installing new water lines
   and new air handling units.
   13.17.2. For equipment that the manufacturer states must be operating in an air-conditioned
   or humidity-controlled space.
   13.17.3. For prefabricated clean rooms installed in non-air conditioned space or when the
   building's central system can't keep the clean room at the right temperature and humidity.
   13.17.4. For operator comfort when the equipment to be installed will make the nearby
   temperature or humidity unreasonably high.

   13.17.5. Mechanical ventilation and separate exhaust systems, when needed to keep people
   safe or equipment operating to the manufacturer's specifications.
13.18. Funding Criteria. Before authorizing the type of work specified in paragraph 13.15
through 13.17 using RDT&E funds, make sure the project meets all these criteria:
   13.18.1. The equipment or facility project must support an approved RDT&E effort.
   13.18.2. Resources must be available.
   13.18.3. Preliminary engineering must be complete.
   13.18.4. The Air Force must submit and the Congress approve a DD Form 1391, FY 20__
   Military Construction Project Data, (appropriate funds). For forms 1391 showing you
   expect to use prior-year funding (fallout money), include Congressional advisory notices:
   "We expect to construct this building with FY ___ (prior year) funding, starting 30 days after
   submittal of this budget request unless the subcommittee disapproves in writing."
13.19. Approving RDT&E Funds:
   13.19.1. Unspecified Minor Construction. Usually, you acquire or modify facilities at an
   R&D installation using programming procedures in AFI 32-1021 and AFI 32-1032. The
   threshold is $750,000. For projects above this threshold, submit appropriate DD 1391s for
   approval and funding using P-341 or MILCON procedures. Follow AFI 32-1021, 1032, and
   1023. If you are planning to construct a building and install specialized RDT&E equipment
   acquired with RDT&E funds at the same time, include the construction and equipment on the
   same DD Form 1391, according to AFI 32-1021. For budget estimate submissions, you may
   consolidate and submit all unspecified minor construction on a single DD Form 1391.
   13.19.2. Contractor Research and Development on Plant Property. Get approval for
   industrial and R&D facilities needed by contractors to perform R&D contacts as specified in
   AFI 63-701. SAF/ AQXR is the HQ USAF office of primary responsibility (OPR) for all
   industrial and R&D facilities supporting contractor operations except for the Lincoln
   Laboratory. SAF/AQT is the office of collateral responsibility (OCR) for the Lincoln
   Laboratory. Process equipment installation projects for the Lincoln Laboratory according to
   this instruction.
   13.19.3. Acquiring and installing RDT&E Equipment. (See paragraph 13.16).
   13.19.4. The Commander of AFMC may:
       13.19.4.1. Approve a project clearly within the intent of paragraph 13.15.1 and 13.16
       provided the construction cost is $750,000 or less.
       13.19.4.2. Approve any project described in paragraph 13.15.2, 13.15.3 or 13.15.6 with
       a cost of $750,000 or less for construction.
       13.19.4.3. Delegate in writing all or part of the approval to particular senior staff
       officers, intermediate commanders, and laboratory directors.
   13.19.5. SAF/FMBI must approve any project not clearly within the intent of paragraphs
   13.15 and 13.16.
13.20. SAF/FMBM. SAF/FMBM develops and maintains Air Force policy and criteria for
using RDT&E funds to finance the type of work defined in paragraphs 13.15 and 13.16.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                 265


   13.20.1. SAF/FMBI ensures a corporate Air Staff review of projects during the Summer
   Budget Review and approves RDT&E funds for work as specified in this instruction.
   13.20.2. SAF/FMBI approves, as an exception, projects not identified in the budget request
   with an installation, test or prototype cost up to $750,000 if you identify justification for their
   urgency (cost penalties, program delays, etc.). Show these projects in the next budget
   submission.
13.21. Responsibilities of SAF/IEI. Authorize the transmission to the appropriate
congressional committees of the Title 10 real property acquisition reports, as prescribed by 10
U.S.C. 2662. Approve all facility leases including non-excess Air Force controlled real property,
as well as the consideration or rental to be charged for leases.
13.22. Responsibilities of HQ AFMC and HQ AFSPC:
   13.22.1. Implement this instruction.
   13.22.2. Oversee projects authorized under this instruction to make sure they comply with
   Air Force guidance. The civil engineer must be involved with the users (laboratories, center,
   divisions, etc.).
   13.22.3. Review, validate, and approve (or obtain SAF/FMBI approval for) using RDT&E
   funds within the intent of this instruction. Make sure a DD Form 1391, Military
   Construction Project Data, is prepared for each project not within the $750,000 threshold
   or not within local approval authority. You may consolidate unspecified minor construction
   less than $750,000 on one Form 1391. You may approve projects costing less than $15,000
   on other auditable documents.
   13.22.4. Submit DD Form 1391, Military Construction Project Data, to AF/ILEC. Submit
   annually on 15 June unless directed otherwise. For construction planned on an incremental
   funding basis, you must justify less than full funding.
   13.22.5. Advise the Air Staff Program Element Monitor (PEM) of the construction
   requirements for the PEM's program and recommend appropriate funding (MILCON or
   RDT&E) under this instruction. If you recommend RDT&E for construction exceeding
   $750,000, document the unusual circumstances and convenience of the Government, which
   warrant using RDT&E.
13.23. Accounting Records:
   13.23.1. Account for work done under this instruction that becomes real property on real
   property records. Refer to AFI 32-9005.
   13.23.2. In the real property account, don't include the cost to install and replace R&D
   equipment; to build structures that are to be destroyed or consumed in a test; or to acquire
   relocatable facilities. AFI 32-9005 tells how to account for real property records.
   13.23.3. Show technical operating equipment on the Chief of Supply accountable records. It
   is considered collateral equipment. At the time a facility is transferred to the real property
   records, transfer all collateral equipment to the Chief of Supply, who, in turn, reissues the
   equipment to the property custodian . For guidance, see AFI 32-9005 and AFMAN 67-1.
13.24. Disposing of Records. Maintain records of past and projected use of RDT&E funds to
inform OSD and Congress. HQ AFMC will record all uses above local approval of RDT&E
 266                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


funds for construction and equipment installation, broken out by program elements if possible.
For disposition of these records, follow the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) at
https://webrims.amc.af.mil.
13.25. Environmental Certification:
   13.25.1. You must consider environment impact in planning and designing each. See AFI
   32-7061.
   13.25.2. You must have a completed EIAP action on all projects, regardless of approval
   authority, before starting work. For all projects above local (Product, Test and Air Logistics
   Center Commander) approval authority, submit an environmental certificate of compliance
   (DD Form 1391c) to HQ AFMC/CEP or HQ AFSPC/CEP before beginning work.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             267


                                          Chapter 14

                                 TEST AND EVALUATION

14.1. Applying This Chapter. The procedures in this chapter take precedence over others in
this instruction for test and evaluation. Follow Chapter 13 for Research, Development, Test and
Evaluation (RDT&E), incremental programming and budgeting rules.
14.2. Funding Test and Evaluation (T&E) Costs.
   14.2.1. Finance development prototypes, pilot line production, and test articles as follows:
       14.2.1.1. Use RDT&E to fund for development (preproduction) prototypes for
       Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) as well as Initial Operational Test and
       Evaluation (IOT&E).
       14.2.1.2. Use RDT&E to pay for initial pilot line production if the testing activity
       requires special pilot items for DT&E or IOT&E. See paragraph 8.24 for pilot
       production guidance.
       14.2.1.3. Use Procurement funds to acquire test articles for Follow-on Test and
       Evaluation (FOT&E), Qualification T&E (QT&E), qualification tests, Production
       Acceptance T&E (PAT&E), and Qualification OT&E (QOT&E), and Force
       Development Evaluation (FDE-Atch 1, Section C, Terms).
       14.2.1.4. Use procurement and O&M-type funds to reconfigure R&D-financed
       preproduction articles reassigned for operations or inventory after the test program is
       complete (see paragraph 8.8).
   14.2.2. Pay for special support costs needed for an approved DT&E, QT&E, qualification
   test, PAT&E, OT&E (IOT&E, QOT&E, and FOT&E) or FDE programs for a different
   military end item as follows: ("Special support" costs consist of major end items not included
   in the stock funds, such as weapons, test vehicles, equipment, or their major components.)
       14.2.2.1. Generally, use RDT&E to buy test articles and test support. Include costs for
       "special support" and "command support" for all RDT&E tests before and leading to
       acceptance for operational use.
       14.2.2.2. Pay for items that can be reassigned to T&E programs from inventory (without
       buying more) as follows: (Items otherwise approved for procurement for operational use
       and not consumed in testing.)
          14.2.2.2.1. Don't use test funds to reimburse for such items (excluding stock-funded
          (DWCF) items).
          14.2.2.2.2. If an operational requirement develops during the loan period, you must
          return that item to the inventory or buy a replacement with test funds.
          14.2.2.2.3. The test director provides for maintenance (other than Permanent
          Modification changes) possible without interfering with the test purposes.
          14.2.2.2.4. Use RDT&E funds to pay for costs restoring these items to their original
          form and condition when they go back to operation after completing the DT&E or
          OT&E is over.
268                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


         14.2.2.2.5. Then, use procurement or O&M-type funds to update the items to
         operating form.
      14.2.2.3. Pay for items consumed in test and evaluation with RDT&E funds; however,
      don't reimburse for consumable rounds of ammunition or similar tactical missiles, unless
      DWCF funds paid for them. We're talking about items bought in quantity for inventory
      under existing procedures and issued as on a priority for testing.
      14.2.2.4. Use RDT&E for items that require engineering, design, integration, test, or
      evaluation before fielding or acceptance for operational use.
  14.2.3. Use RDT&E (AFMC) to acquire major test vehicles, such as ballistic boosters or
  upper stages (either "standardized" as test vehicles or bought centrally for operational use or
  inventory). These vehicles must support an approved program for development testing which
  RDT&E is paying for.
  14.2.4. Pay for flying hours as follows:
      14.2.4.1. The owning command pays for aircraft flying hours and support (see exception
      below). (The program document for the command that "owns" the aircraft shows
      authorized test and evaluation flying hours.)
      14.2.4.2. Don't use test funds to reimburse maintenance costs per flying hour at the base-
      level.
      14.2.4.3. EXCEPTION: Follow the guidance in DoDD 3200.11-D for flying-hour
      support provided by designated DoD major ranges and test facilities. Follow paragraph
      14.3.5.1 for Air Mobility Command (AMC) TWCF aircraft not used as the primary test
      vehicle.
  14.2.5. Reimburse direct costs for support from designated R&D and test activities (See
  Chapter 7, Section 7I), regardless of the other provisions of this chapter. (See guidance on
  designated support activities for test and evaluation in DoDD 3200.11D, AFI 99-101 and AFI
  99-102).
  14.2.6. Use procurement or O&M funds, as appropriate, to pay for testing not associated
  with RDT&E, such as:
      14.2.6.1. Acceptance, quality control, FDE, and surveillance testing of articles obtained
      for other than RDT&E.
      14.2.6.2. Routine testing for logistic support.
      14.2.6.3. Testing related to operating and maintaining equipment and material bought
      under appropriations other than RDT&E.
      14.2.6.4. Testing needed to show a plant can produce items approved for production
      (charge to procurement as part of the initial acquisition cost).
  14.2.7. Use O&M or procurement funds (based on Expense/Investment criteria) to fund
  commercial and nondevelopmental items for QT&E and QOTE which do not require
  RDT&E engineering, design or integration. Pay for personnel and command support costs
  from O&M when field units test and evaluate operation of commercial items for doctrine,
  operations, or organization.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                          269


   14.2.8. Apply this guidance for all force development evaluation (FDE) which is conducted
   after accepting an item for operational use. Also apply it for FDE to show how the item
   operates or to develop operational tactics.
      14.2.8.1. Use O&M or procurement funds (based on expense/investment criteria) to
      acquire test articles.
      14.2.8.2. Use O&M for personnel and command support.
   14.2.9. Use procurement funds (subject to expense/investment criteria) to buy off-the-shelf
   equipment. But use RDT&E if the equipment supports RDT&E-funded T&E. Also, use
   RDT&E for items, including special purpose software, that require engineering design,
   integration, testing, or evaluation.
   14.2.10. Use RDT&E for DT&E and OT&E of special-purpose equipment and software for
   automatic data processing. Here we mean equipment or software:
      14.2.10.1. Specially designed to meet a military operational requirement or to do only a
      predetermined set or series of computations.
      14.2.10.2. Which may need to meet specific physical or environmental conditions.
      14.2.10.3. Which are physically or functionally integral to a higher order system. Use
      O&M or Procurement funds (based on expense/investment criteria) to buy and test these
      items for operation.
   14.2.11. See Chapter 4, Section 4B, for funding general-purpose equipment and software
   used in automatic data processing.
14.3. Funding OT&E and Force Development Evaluation (FDE):
   14.3.1. Types of Funds. Except when this chapter states otherwise:
      14.3.1.1. The Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) funds the
      net additive costs to do OT&E (IOT&E and FOT&E), and direct support costs with
      RDT&E. QOT&E is funded with O&M.
      14.3.1.2. The MAJCOM test organization funds net additive costs to do FDE, as well as
      direct support costs with O&M.
   14.3.2. Test Items:
      14.3.2.1. The owning command pays the cost of procuring the test item and its direct
      support (either the implementing command (using RDT&E or procurement funds), or the
      operational command (using O&M funds). Direct support, funded either by the
      operational or implementing command, includes maintaining the test item (including
      contractor support), supply items to keep the test item serviceable, and POL for the test
      item.
      14.3.2.2. Don't use OT&E test funds for these costs
   14.3.3. AFOTEC Support of OT&E. AFOTEC uses its O&M to do some work that
   supports all OT&E (IOT&E, QOTE, and FOT&E):
      14.3.3.1. Participating in early RDT&E efforts and providing OT&E expertise
      throughout the acquisition process.
 270                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       14.3.3.2. Monitoring of MAJCOM-conducted FED.
       14.3.3.3. Administering OOTA policies and programs.
       14.3.3.4. Analyzing test results not related to specific programs.
       14.3.3.5. Supporting scientific, technical, planning, or analytical work under contract but
       not related to specific programs.
   14.3.4. Implementing Command's (usually AFMC) Involvement in OOTA. The
   implementing command uses O&M or RDT&E funds to pay its own travel, per diem,
   overtime, and other support costs. This does not apply to AFMC organizations involved with
   the program office or acquisition process that provide technical support to the test, such as
   the Air Force Human Resources Laboratory (AFHRL).
   14.3.5. Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF) Support to OT&E and FDE:
       14.3.5.1. Use as an OT&E and FDE Test Vehicle. If one of AMC's TWCF aircraft is
       required for a dedicated test role, AMC, as owning command, will provide the aircraft
       without reimbursement from test funds. An example would be an aircraft required to
       airdrop test material or fly approaches to a test navigational aid (NAVAID). HQ
       AMC/TE budgets and funds for OT&E and FDE dedicated test flying hours.
       14.3.5.2. Use To Transport of Test Articles or People. Pay transportation costs from
       test funds when airlift must move test articles or people. Request support through the
       airlift validator command or agency.
   14.3.6. Post-Test Costs. When active initial operational testing is over, AFOTEC will
   continue to use test funds for FOT&E activities that occur as a result of test reports and
   decision briefings. After these test activities are complete, the operating or supporting
   command finances these costs.
   14.3.7. Personnel Costs. Use test funds to reimburse overtime and pay temporary overhires
   directly supporting the test for "fee for service" operations, such as ranges. Don't use test
   funds to reimburse supporting commands regular base pay (base and benefits) of
   permanently authorized personnel.
14.4. Funding Qualification Tests, QT&E, and PAT&E Tests. Use procurement
appropriations to pay for these tests (including verification of technical data) performed during
the production cycle (or when you don't have RDT&E funding). Also, use procurement to pay
for the QT&E of aircraft, missiles, and equipment after modifications. Pay the implementing
command's TDY costs with O&M-type (3400 or 3600) funds.
14.5. Budgeting and Funding DT&E. AFMC budgets and funds DT&E requirements as a part
of the total development budget for weapon system.
14.6. Budgeting and Funding for IOT&E and FOT&E:
   14.6.1. AFOTEC will fund IOT&E and FOT&E for each acquisition program with RDT&E.
   (See paragraph 14.3. and chapters 1 and 5 of the DoD Financial Management Regulation,
   7000.14-R, Volume 2.) AFOTEC O&M costs will be funded using regular O&M budget
   channels.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             271


   14.6.2. AFOTEC will fund IOT&E and known FOT&E requirements for the Program
   Objective Memorandum (POM) and budget submissions to HQ USAF/TER and
   SAF/AQXR/FMBI. There are two exceptions: a) AFOTEC identifies requirements for MFP
   XI funded IOT&E and FOT&E to USSOCOM, who is responsible for POM and budget
   submissions; and b) case-by-case exceptions where large IOT&E programs (approximately
   $8M) are concerned.
   14.6.3. For large IOT&E programs only, HQ USAF/TER, SAF/AQX, SAF/FMBI, and
   program office representatives will review each large IOT&E program (during POM
   development) to determine whether AFOTEC or the program will fund the testing. The
   outcome of this effort will result in programming IOT&E funding requirements for large
   IOT&E programs, lead-time-away, into the correct Program Element (PE). For remaining
   programs, OT&E requirements will be identified budget lead-time away to AFOTEC to be
   included in their POM submission. Otherwise, funding must accompany the test program for
   AFOTEC to conduct the testing. Additionally, if there are additional testing costs as a result
   of program slippage or deferments, the customer must provide additional funding as
   appropriate. HQ USAF/TER will confirm that IOT&E and FOT&E funding levels in the
   POM and Budget Estimate Submission exercises are adequate, and identify any shortfalls to
   SAF/AQXR to ensure proper programming.
   14.6.4. If an IOT&E or FOT&E test team member requires Type 1 factory training (as
   defined in AFI 36-2201) to meet test team requirements, Air Education and Training
   Command (AETC) will pay the training cost with RDT&E funds, irrespective of any follow-
   on benefits the training might provide. This includes the contract cost itself and related TDY.
   AFOTEC will issue training funds to AETC as sole procuring agent. If a separate training
   contract is impractical, the program manager may include Type 1 training as a line item in
   the acquisition contract, as provided in AFI 36-2201.
   14.6.5. When combining DT&E and OT&E, the implementing command programs and
   budgets the DT&E portion. AFOTEC will program and budget net additive costs for IOT&E
   and FOT&E (see paragraph 14.6.2), which should agree with those activities assigned to
   AFOTEC in the T&E Master Plan (TEMP) and associated Test Resource Plan (TRP).
   14.6.6. In determining IOT&E and FOT&E versus FDE costs for budget formulation, use
   the scheduled major production decision date directed when preparing field budget
   submissions. Use RDT&E funds prior to acceptance for operational use, and use O&M or
   Procurement funds after acceptance for operational use. For programs that don't have a major
   production decision, use the net additive IOT&E or FOT&E requirements as determined by
   AFOTEC for planning, budgeting and funding.
14.7. Budgeting and Funding for QOT&E Requirements. The AFOTEC will use the same
guidance and procedures from paragraph 14.6 to fund QOT&E, except that O&M or
Procurement funds will be used in lieu of RDT&E funds. AETC will continue to fund Type 1
training for O&M-funded QOT&E.
14.8. Budgeting and Funding FDE. The MAJCOM test organizations program, budget and
fund for FDE test costs (see paragraph 14.3) and submits these requirements in their command
O&M submissions using regular O&M budget channels. AETC will continue to fund Type 1
training for O&M-funded FDEs.

                                          Chapter 15

             AIR FORCE RESERVE APPROPRIATIONS (57*3700, 57*3740)

15.1. Overview. This chapter covers Reserve Personnel (57*3700) and Operation and
Maintenance, Air Force Reserve (O&M, AFR) (57*3740). For Military Construction, USAFR
(57*3730), apply the guidance in Chapter 9. For further guidance, see AFRCI 65-601.

   (57*3850); Operation and Maintenance, ANG (57*3840); and the Military Construction,
   ANG (57*3830) appropriations.
   16.1.2. Other Air Force appropriations, which support the ANG on either a reimbursable or
   nonreimbursable basis. If the active Air Force and ANG activities disagree whether Air Force
   support costs are reimbursable or nonreimbursable, SAF/FMB will make the final decision.
   16.1.3. Resources provided by the sovereign states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the
   Virgin Islands, Guam, and the District of Columbia for their respective ANG activities.
16.2. Using National Guard Personnel, Air Force Appropriation (57*3850):
   16.2.1. Use 57*3850 to fund pay, allowances, clothing, subsistence, gratuities, and travel.
   You also use this appropriation for expenses of ANG personnel on duty under 10 U.S.C.
   12301(d); for expenses under 32 U.S.C. 708; and for expenses of personnel undergoing
   active duty training or performing inactive duty training as authorized by law.
   16.2.2. The Air Force provides personnel support by assigning active duty personnel to
   ANG activities. Charge the pay and allowances of these active duty Air Force personnel to
   the MILPERS, Air Force appropriation (57*3500).
   16.2.3. To determine whether to finance ANG training costs from the National Guard
   Personnel, Air Force (57*3850) or MILPERS, Air Force (57*3500) appropriation, apply
   these rules:
       16.2.3.1. If the purpose of ANG participation is to meet Air National Guard personnel
       training requirements, charge the costs to the National Guard Personnel, Air Force,
       appropriation.
       16.2.3.2. If the purpose of the participation is to support active Air Force mission
       requirements, charge the costs to the MILPERS, Air Force appropriation. But, you should
       charge any per diem entitlements at the principal duty station, (as well as travel costs
       incurred in the performance of TDY away from the principal duty station) to the O&M,
       Air Force, funds of the active duty Air Force activity being supported.
       16.2.3.3. You may mix resources (workdays and/or travel costs) between the active Air
       Force and ANG appropriations when it's clearly beneficial to the Total Force and
       mutually agreeable to both the ANG unit providing the support and the active Air Force
       command requesting the support.
       16.2.3.4. The Air Force finances O&M costs associated with Air Force centrally
       controlled education and training courses provided by the Air University and the Air
       Education and Training Command without reimbursement. EXCEPTION:
       Organizational equipment issued to individuals or units (that is, field jackets) will be

     duty training or full-time training duty of less than 20 weeks and PCS travel for a
     duration of 20 weeks or more. It also provides for related expenses for personnel of the
     ANG on duty under 10 U.S.C. 12301(d) and 32 U.S.C. 708.
         16.2.4.2.1. School Training (Project 541). These personnel include ANG officers
         and enlisted members performing tours of paid active duty for training as students
         enrolled in regular, associate, and refresher and technical courses. These courses are
         offered at service schools, area schools, unit schools, officer training schools, and
         other installations that provide training that applies to the member's assignments and
         readiness.
         16.2.4.2.2. Special Training (Project 542). These personnel include ANG officers
         and enlisted members who perform tours of paid active duty for training for 139 days
         or less other than those covered by pay groups A and F, and school training (for
         example, command requirements for the National Guard Bureau, ANG support of Air

            Service needs. The Veterans Administration will make actual payments to individuals
            from funds transferred from the trust fund.
     16.2.5. Use applicable fund citations in active duty or training orders for pay and
     allowances, travel, and transportation costs. The general rule is that you charge expenses to
     the fiscal year (FY) appropriation current when the government incurs the expenses.
     Therefore, if services or travel and transportation cover parts of 2 fiscal years, you charge the
     total costs in part to both appropriations (see DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Accounting for
     Obligations for criteria and DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Procedures for Travel
     Accounting Operations for using dual citations).

        materiel and all issues of expense materiel from the Supply Management business
        areas of the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) to the ANG. ANG units are
        authorized customers of the DWCF; installations will provide them customer status
        equal to that furnished other Air Force organizations. Determine and administer
        credits earned according to the current directives governing returns to the DWCF by
        any authorized Air Force customer.
        16.3.2.1.7. Care of the dead (except for those expenses paid by DFAS-DE, citing Air

        capability, where the host has to establish a capability to provide the services or
        maintenance.
        16.3.2.1.10. Major repair projects for jointly used facilities. Charge the cost on a pro
        rata basis tied to the percentage of occupancy or utilization. EXCEPTION: where the
        project results from an operation peculiar to one agency, that agency will bear the full
        expense of the project.
        16.3.2.1.11. Contract maintenance and repair of ground powered vehicles and other

         by contract. An example would be equipment (unique to the ANG tenant) being
         repaired in the host base precision measurement equipment laboratory (PMEL) which
         requires special parts or expense materiel to accomplish the repair. Determine these
         special support requirements pertaining to repair and calibration of the tenant's unique

         telegrams that involve a toll charge are made on a collect basis or paid for by the
         ANG personnel concerned.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                          283


          16.3.2.2.10. Billeting and messing facilities are made available to transient ANG
          flight crews and passengers in the same manner as for other transient military
          personnel. Such facilities are furnished on a cash sale basis.
          16.3.2.2.11. Meteorological equipment (MET) maintenance support furnished to
          ANG weather flights by the Air Force Communications Command (AFCC) weather
          maintenance technicians.
          16.3.2.2.12. Support of ANG units performing Air Force missions as governed by
          Chapter 7.
16.4. Basis for Reimbursing for Depot Maintenance. This paragraph explains how the ANG
reimburses the Air Force for depot maintenance support.
   16.4.1. The ANG O&M appropriation reimburses the depot maintenance business area of the
   Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) for depot-level support in these areas:
      16.4.1.1. Aircraft maintenance.
      16.4.1.2. Engine overhaul.
      16.4.1.3. Other major end items repair.
      16.4.1.4. Area support.
      16.4.1.5. Service engineering.
   16.4.2. Accomplish reimbursement for the items shown above as follows:
      16.4.2.1. Aircraft maintenance, other major end item repair (except generators), and area
      support are funded by direct cite. Therefore, the ANG issues funds by RC/CC, PEC,
      EEIC, and program control number (PCN) to the Air National Guard Readiness Center
      (ANGRC), ADSN 415300, Stop 18, Andrews AFB DC 20331-6008. ANGRC, in turn,
      issues AF Forms 185, Project Order, to the Air Logistics Centers (ALCs), who then
      signs and return them to ANGRC. These signed project orders obligate the ANG funds.
      The ANGRC then disburses the direct cite funds upon receipt of the SF 1080 billings,
      providing sufficient funds have been obligated by RC/CC or PCN. For backup
      information, when work is ordered through the ALC, ANG funds are reflected by the Air
      Force Materiel Command (AFMC) on AFMC Form 181, Project Orders, and on AFMC
      Form 194, Annual Customer Orders. The ALC will forward information copies of
      these forms (annotated by PCN) to ANGRC as evidence of actions taken toward
      accomplishing the work orders.
      16.4.2.2. The ANG reimburses the DWCF for engine overhaul, generators, exchangeable
      repairs, and service engineering . Therefore, the ANG issues funds directly to the ALC
      using an ANG assigned OAC/OBAN. Specific instructions for each area follow:
          16.4.2.2.1. Engine Overhaul. On a monthly basis, OC-ALC/ACFSA furnishes engine
          managers at Oklahoma City ALC (OC-ALC) the reimbursable customer engine input
          report that provides quantities, by type/model/series, of the engines scheduled into
          work, by customer. OC-ALC/ACFSA will charge monthly for the standard
          reimbursable unit cost for each engine input against funding received from the ANG.
          This standard cost is composed of the current DWCF engine unit sales price plus the
          repair cost of its related exchange material.
 284                                            AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


         16.4.2.2.2. Generators. The annual requirement, as estimated by AFMC, is made
         available at the beginning of the fiscal year. Accept bills as the work is performed.
         16.4.2.2.3. Sustaining Engineering. The ANG budgets for its pro rata share of the
         total sustaining engineering cost based on data provided by AFMC. HQ AFMC
         identifies to the ALCs reimbursable line items and planning costs for the ANG, at the
         beginning of the FY, based on the estimated annual requirement. The ANG issues
         funding directly for all Sustaining Engineering costs.
         16.4.2.2.4. The Air Directorate, National Guard Bureau, prepares, submits and
         justifies budget estimates to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Office of
         Management and Budget.
16.5. Supporting ANG Conversions. The active Air Force gaining command will fund TDY
costs for Air Force augmentees who support ANG conversions.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             285

                           SECURITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

17.1. The Security Assistance (SA) program. The Security Assistance (SA) program is
composed of six major components: Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Foreign Military Financing
(FMF), Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), International Military Education and Training (IMET),
Economic support Fund (ESF), and Peacekeeping Operations (PKO). Other related SA programs
are leases to friendly governments, selling defense articles declared to be excess to foreign
nations, emergency draw downs, and third-country transfers.
   17.1.1. FMS is a non-appropriated program through which eligible foreign governments
   purchase defense articles, services, and training from the U.S. Government. FMS are made
   under the authority of the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, as amended.
   17.1.2. FMF consists of congressionally appropriated grants and loans, which enable foreign
   governments to purchase U.S. defense articles, services, and training through either FMS or
   DCS. FMS are made under the authority of the Arms Export control Act of 1976, as
   amended.
   17.1.3. DCS are sales made by U.S. industry directly to a foreign buyer. DCS are licensed by
   the Department of State. The Department of Defense does not administer the DCS program.
   17.1.4. IMET provides training of selected foreign military and related civilian personnel in
   the U.S. and, in some cases, in overseas U.S. military facilities. The training is accomplished
   on a grant basis. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, authorizes IMET.
   17.1.5. ESF promotes economic and political stability in foreign areas where the U.S. has
   political and security interests. The Department of Defense does not administer the ESF
   program.
   17.1.6. PKO provides funds for Multinational Forces and Observers. The Department of
   Defense does not administer the PKO program.
17.2. Anti-Deficiency Act. The Secretary of the Air Force General Counsel (SAF/GC) has
determined that FMS trust funds are appropriated, at least as far as the application of the Anti-
Deficiency Act is concerned. The determination stated that ". . . . appropriated funds are not
limited to those appropriated by Congress to federal agencies from the general fund of the
Treasury. Rather, funds available to agencies are considered appropriated, if made available for
collection and expenditure pursuant to specific statutory authority. Transactions which involve
FMS trust funds can constitute violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act." Issues involving FMS
monies need to be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all relevant
aspects of each case for application of the Anti-Deficiency Act.

                     DEFENSE WORKING CAPITAL FUND (DWCF)

Section 18A—Financial Administration of the DWCF

18.1. Issuing and Complying with Budget Authority Documents:
   18.1.1. Unit Cost Goals:
       18.1.1.1. The Office of Undersecretary of Defense, Comptroller (OUSD(C)) uses Unit
       Cost Resourcing (UCR) for DWCF financial management, including cost measurement,
       cost control, and funding allocation. OUSD (C), Air Force and AFMC issue Annual
       Operating Budget (AOB) Documents in the form of unit cost goals, based on approved
       operating and capital budgets.
       18.1.1.2. Some DWCF business areas, such as supply operations, are authorized to incur
       costs while anticipating customer orders.
       18.1.1.3. For other DWCF business areas, such as depot maintenance, costs are
       authorized only after receiving a customer order. The AOB document provides the
       overall cost goal. The total costs you can incur depend on the cost goals applied to the
       actual customer-funded workload.
       18.1.1.4. The Air Force and Commands may issue activity goals that vary from the total
       goal for an Activity Group. But, the Air Force may not exceed the sum of its activity
       goals (total cost authority). Cost authority, or the amount "earned," equals the actual
       workload times the individual cost goals for each Activity Group. Individual activities
       and Activity Groups can continue to incur costs as long as the total costs for all Air Force
       Activity Groups do not exceed the total cost authority for that Component as of fiscal
       year end.
   18.1.2. Fiscal Control. Don't exceed the Total Capital Cost limitation in your Cost
   Authority Document, based on Section 1517 of Title 31, United States Code (Anti-Deficiency
   Act). The "Limitations and Guidance" section of your Cost Authority Document identifies
   special limitations, goals and other guidance for each Activity Group.
   18.1.3. Reprogramming:
       18.1.3.1. Operating Budget. The Air Force may reprogram within business areas as
       long as it doesn't exceed its overall unit cost goal.
       18.1.3.2. Capital Budget:
          18.1.3.2.1. The total annual capital budget approved for each Component by the
          Congress during review of the Fund may only be exceeded to the extent that projects
          which were included in the operating budget based on approved expense/investment
          criteria must be executed as capital budget items due to revised cost estimates.
          Transfer of projects from the operating budget reduces the amount earned in the
          operating budget. Exceeding the capital budget (the total includes amounts
          reprogrammed) is an Anti-Deficiency Act violation. (DoD FMR 7000.14-R Volume
          2B, Chapter 9, Paragraph 090103. C.12).
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            287


          18.1.3.2.2. The Air Force may reprogram capital funds between business areas, but
          the maximum annual increase in any one Activity Group cannot exceed $10 million
          for each type of capital approved in the President's Budget. The types of capital
          consist of ADP equipment and telecommunications, non-ADP equipment and
          telecommunications, minor construction, and software development. Reprogramming
          into an Activity Group’s capital budget from the operating budget doesn't count
          against the $10 million threshold.
          18.1.3.2.3. ―Only those capital asset projects that have been included in the Air Force
          President’s Budget may be financed through the Capital Purchase Program (CPP).
          However, in the year of execution, project substitutions may be made when contracts
          on approved projects are delayed or when operational necessity warrants. The
          following approval levels and dollar threshold apply to changes to projects approved
          in the capital budget section of the AOB, including re-programming, substitutions,
          cancellations and additions:
              18.1.3.2.3.1. For each Business Activity Group, all current year adjustments or
              changes to capital projects that are equal to, or greater than by a cumulative
              amount of $1,000,000 during a fiscal year (FY) required approval from the Office
              Secretary of Defense (OSD), Director for Revolving Funds.
              18.1.3.2.3.2. For each Business Activity Group, all current year adjustment or
              changes between categories of capital projects (i.e., minor construction,
              equipment, ADP equipment and telecommunications, non-ADP equipment and
              software development) or activity groups that increase a category by a cumulative
              amount equal to, or greater than $1,000,000, within a program year, requires
              approval from the OSD Director of Revolving Funds. If either of these thresholds
              are breached, the OSD Director of Revolving Funds must approve project
              substitutions prior to their initiation. Subdividing of projects is not allowed.
          18.1.3.2.4. Capital Purchases Program is budgeted and funded by project. A project
          can constitute an integrated system or network of more than one asset. There may be
          multiple assets within a CPP project that exceed the individual CPP threshold.
          Individual equipment or facility items are recorded separately on the accounting
          records. A single CPP request will not mix different CPP categories. When different
          CPP categories are required to fill a single requirement, each request will note the
          other requirements.
      18.1.3.3. Revisions. You may revise annual budgets whenever circumstances permit
      and your Command approves.
18.2. Recovering Full Costs and Setting Prices:
   18.2.1. All Activity Groups in the Fund must set prices to recover full costs, including all
   direct costs, indirect costs, general and administrative support provided by others,
   depreciation expenses, and amortization. Include all costs in the Activity Group's operating
   budget. The budget process will fix prices for the year of execution. All levels of command
   will:
      18.2.1.1. Evaluate actual costs against revenue generated by workload at established
      prices.
 288                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       18.2.1.2. Determine profits or losses at the end of the year and use them to evaluate
       operating (financial execution) efficiency.
       18.2.1.3. Some DWCF areas may still have some Imputed (Unfunded) costs, e.g. kits to
       the DMAG. Imputed costs will be tracked, but not in the AF rates. FMS customers will
       be billed the Imputed costs per the FMR, Vol. 15. Other non-AF customers will be billed
       per the FMR, Vol. 11A.
   18.2.2. Activity Groups will set prices for the budget year(s) to recover costs over the long
   run. This means you set prices to achieve an Accumulated Operating Result (AOR) in the
   budget year of zero. While carrying out the budget, you'll have either a positive or negative
   Net Operating Result (NOR). So, you set prices in the budget year either to make up actual or
   projected losses, or to give back actual or projected gains in the budget year, based on such
   factors as cash position, projected savings initiatives, or other known impact. Activity Group
   prices must match the rate changes approved by OUSD(C) during the budget review.
18.3. Setting Rates:
   18.3.1. During budgeting, OUSD(C) reviews and approves stable rates to fully recover costs
   in all business areas during that fiscal year. (NOTE: The stabilized rate is the cost per direct
   labor hour (or other output measure) that the depot or business area charges customers for its
   products and services. The stabilized rate is determined by taking the approved Direct Labor
   Hour rate (or other cost per output measure) for the budget year and adjusting it for both
   intra- and inter-Fund transactions to reflect changes in the cost of purchases between Activity
   Groups within the Fund, for prior-year gains or losses shown by the AOR and for other
   approved funding objectives, such as a cash or a capital surcharge.) To set rates, the Fund
   places business areas into two groups:
       18.3.1.1. Supply Management. Use commodity costs with a surcharge to establish
       customer rates. (See DoD Regulation 7000.14-R, DoD Financial Management
       Regulation, Volume 2, chapter 9.).
       18.3.1.2. Non-Supply Management. Depot Maintenance, Information Services, and all
       other business areas. Use unit cost rates based on identified output measures which
       establish fully cost-burdened rates per output, such as a cost per direct labor hour, cost
       per product, cost per item received, or cost per item shipped, etc. These Activity Groups
       establish their output rates and the stabilized customer rates in generally the same way.
   18.3.2. Charge the annual stabilized rate for all new customer orders received and accepted
   during that specific fiscal year, regardless of the fiscal year you actually do and bill the work.
   Organic DMAG establishes fixed prices (stabilized rate times standard hours) for planned
   work. Unplanned work is priced at stabilized rates times actual direct hours.
   18.3.3. When submitting your budget estimate, develop customer rates to recoup all costs for
   your operating and capital budgets, including all labor and non-labor, direct, indirect, and
   general and administrative overhead costs. After determining required costs and proposed
   rate structures to recover them, the Air Force will adjust budgets for appropriated customer
   accounts so that customer and DWCF business budgets are in balance.
   18.3.4. The Air Force must propose cost, program levels, and rate changes by Activity
   Groups in the budget estimate submission to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            289


   (OUSD). (NOTE: the annual published rate change for Activity Groups is the percentage
   change in the stabilized rate or price between fiscal years. For example, for organic Depot
   Maintenance you determine the Budget Year rate by dividing the approved Direct Labor
   Hour rate proposed for the Budget Year by the stabilized Direct Labor Hour rate effective for
   the previous year. That value, expressed as a percentage (plus or minus from a base of one),
   is the composite price-change rate customers will use in their appropriated fund
   submissions.)
      18.3.4.1. AFMC should establish rates and prices for Business Area budgets:
          18.3.4.1.1. Carefully review all projected operational costs for the fiscal year, and
          propose the least expensive operations possible.
          18.3.4.1.2. Project customer requirements including anticipated workloads
          programmed for the budget year, based on identified outputs such as direct labor
          hours by project, tons shipped, line items received, and all other approved output
          measures for each business area.
          18.3.4.1.3. In developing proposed rates, conform to OSD and OMB guidance on the
          impact of inflation, projected pay changes, and other programmatic and policy
          changes.
      18.3.4.2. OUSD (C) will establish final approved costs, program levels, and rate changes
      for each Activity Group by Program Budget Decision (PBD) documents. First, they'll
      reconcile customer account program levels with anticipated Fund costs, inter-Fund sales,
      and transactions. Then, they'll adjust for NOR to bring Accumulated Operating Results to
      zero for the Budget Year.
18.4. Applying Depreciation:
   18.4.1. Under the total-cost concept, DWCF activities must track capital investment
   purchases, depreciate them, and pass the charges on to their customers as part of the price of
   goods and services sold. This is done by including the depreciation cost in the sales rate and
   then being recovered like all other costs. Here, a capital investment means anything costing
   in excess of $100,000 that has an expected life of more than two years. Exclude aircraft and
   missile procurement accounts (3010 and 3020) and major construction (3300). (Depreciation
   measures how much of a given resource is consumed in a single year and is part of the total
   cost of producing an output. Depreciation shows that capital assets are useful after the first
   year and often after they are fully depreciated as well.)
   18.4.2. Include assets acquired through the Capital Purchases Program, Asset Capitalization
   Program (ACP), and donated assets, such as those provided as support equipment in
   conjunction with weapon system acquisition or modifications in your depreciation costs.
   18.4.3. Apply straight-line depreciation based on capitalized amount less residual value,
   including installation and related costs. WCF will use the depreciation schedule in the DoD
   FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter 6, Paragraph 60206. Use this schedule for:
      18.4.3.1. Facilities Construction Projects (including minor construction) – 20 years
      18.4.3.2. Equipment , other than ADPE – 10 years
 290                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       18.4.3.3. ADPE and Telecommunications – < 5, 5, or 10 years - depending on the actual
       estimated useful life as used in the acquisition justification.
       18.4.3.4. Software – 5 years
18.5. Including Costs in the DWCF. Reflect the total cost of production in pricing goods and
services. Total Cost of Production includes direct costs, indirect costs, allocated general and
administrative (G&A) costs, and depreciation expenses and amortization (i.e. absorption
accounting). In addition, apply this special guidance.
   18.5.1. Capital Budget:
       18.5.1.1. You must separately identify budgetary resources for capital investments in an
       approved capital budget and amortize or depreciate their costs over a predetermined
       period. Capital investment includes any investment in equipment, other than ADPE and
       telecommunications equipment; ADPE and telecommunications resources; software
       development; minor construction and management improvements having a value
       exceeding $100,000 and a useful life of two years or greater. The $100,000 cut-off is
       based on Congressional actions on expense and investment criteria. You must fully
       reflect depreciation of capital equipment in the operating costs and rates of Fund
       businesses.
       18.5.1.2. Depreciate software development and modernization costs incurred by Fund
       activities for projects installed and operational after October 1 of a specific fiscal year.
       Start depreciation in the month the project is installed and operational (even though it
       may not be used in operations that month). Depreciate incremental deliveries of these
       projects if the cost of the delivery exceeds $100,000. Usually, a central design activity
       (CDA) improves software based on a reimbursable order from the individual activity,
       functional Activity Group, or corporate level. Whether accomplished by an in-house or
       contractor CDA, you must fully fund the order placed with the design activity; i.e., the
       order must reflect the total cost of the improvement included in the funded order, rather
       than incremental funding over a number of years. Apply the full funding rule to any
       orders to or from a DWCF activity.
       18.5.1.3. Minor construction projects costing $750,000 or less should be funded through
       the capital budget. Depreciate them according to paragraph 18.4.
       18.5.1.4. See paragraph 18.6 for appropriation-funded capital assets.
       18.5.1.5. Don't use the capital budget to establish a new (or to expand) organic capability
       except as approved in a capital budget. NOTE: If the new or expanded organic capability
       is due to a new or expanded weapon system/capability, refer to paragraph 18.6.9.
       18.5.1.6. DWCF activities must derive resources needed for new capital assets mainly
       from depreciating DWCF assets. With OUSD (C) approval, and when necessary to fund
       the approved capital investment, you may include a capital-purchase surcharge to pay for
       whatever depreciation doesn't cover.
   18.5.2. Civilian Labor. Include compensation and benefits for civilians assigned to a
   DWCF activity. Also include payments to the Department of Labor for injuries and damages
   to DWCF employees.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                           291


  18.5.3. Incentive Program for Voluntary Separation of Civilians. Finance and include in
  stabilized rates the cost of incentives for assigned civilian employees to separate unless you
  must offer them because of directed base realignment and closure. If the offering results from
  a base realignment and closure, pay the civilian separation incentive from the appropriate
  Base Realignment and Closure Account.
  18.5.4. Costs for Military Personnel:
     18.5.4.1. You must reimburse Military Personnel's centrally managed account (CMA)
     for military people assigned to DWCF. Use the civilian equivalency rates provided by
     OUSD Comptroller. NOTE: This is not applicable to the Transportation Working Capital
     Fund (TWCF).
  18.5.5. Temporary Duty (TDY) and Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Travel and
  Transportation. Finance the cost of civilian and military TDY for people assigned to the
  DWCF. The gaining DWCF business area pays for PCS transportation civilian employees,
  their dependents, and household goods. Pay PCS costs resulting from a directed base
  realignment and closure action from the appropriate Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)
  Account.
  18.5.6. Transportation. Finance transportation costs (FDT and SDT) for DWCF property
  in the DWCF. Follow Table 18.1 through Table 18.3.
  18.5.7. Materiel and Supplies. Include the cost of expense materiel consumed in the
  performance of the DWCF activity's mission (both in-house and government furnished
  materiel (GFM) to contractors). Charge the DWCF operating account for expense materiel
  (non-procurement funded materiel). This includes inventory adjustments, price revisions, and
  noncreditable returns.
  18.5.8. Tools and Equipment. For organic depot maintenance, you will charge and
  expense the costs of tools and equipment having a unit value less than $100,000, regardless
  of life expectancy, to the applicable DWCF accounting classification. When the unit cost of
  tools and equipment is $100,000 or more and their useful life is more than 2 years, the
  DWCF will pay for, capitalize, and depreciate the item.
  18.5.9. Contractual Services:
     18.5.9.1. In-House. Include the cost of work done under contract to accomplish mission
     projects, and other services procured on a reimbursable basis from other government
     activities. Include G&A costs, equipment rental, communications, utilities, training,
     printing and reproduction, custodial services, and other contractual service the DWCF
     activity requires.
     18.5.9.2. Contracts or Services From Other Government Agencies. This includes
     work agreed to by an authorized official of a private firm or another government agency
     that can do the DWCF work. Use the appropriate government contracting process.
     18.5.9.3. Contractual Service Requirements. When DWCF facilities can't do a job,
     you may issue commercial contracts for that job and related services. Treat the cost of
     these jobs as a DWCF transaction only when it becomes necessary and follow approved
     policy for diverting workload to commercial sources after it's inducted into DWCF.
 292                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   18.5.10. Type 1 Factory Training. Charge initial cadre and follow-on factory training costs
   to the DWCF activity of assignment. In FY 94 and after, DoD activities will budget and fund
   for initial factory training course costs (excluding TDY) from the investment account
   (appropriated fund or DWCF capital budget) that finances the related equipment or system.
   Continue to fund TDY costs from your business area's operating account. See Chapter 10,
   Section 10L for funding associated with Factory Training costs.
   18.5.11. Management Headquarters accounts include: major command, subordinate
   commands, major claimants (for the Navy), and Defense Agency Headquarters (DoD FMR
   7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 9, Paragraph 090102N).
   18.5.12. Base Support. Support costs, which are measuarable and directly attributable to
   support provided to a DWCF entity, must be reimbursed to the host base. Other support costs
   not in the foregoing category (―measurable and directly attributable‖) may be waived if the
   support provided does not appreciably increase the host installation’s cost (DoDI 4000.19,
   paragraph 4.6. The cost comparability Handbook is a useful guide to determine support costs,
   both funded and unfunded.
18.6. Excluding Costs from the DWCF:
   18.6.1. Mobilization and Surge Costs. You must use direct appropriations to reimburse all
   DWCF costs related to maintaining a capacity to meet mobilization requirements. Don't
   finance these costs through customer rates. Prices of DWCF outputs should reflect peacetime
   operating costs only. Although you finance these mobilization costs as non-fund direct
   appropriations, they are elements of business area costs and you must fully justify them in
   DWCF budget estimates.
   18.6.2. Removal and Salvage of Plant and Equipment. Don't use DWCF to pay for plant
   closing, layaway and preservation, redistribution of residual inventories (packing, crating,
   handling, and transportation), and operation and maintenance expenses of facilities and
   equipment in standby or pending disposition.
   18.6.3. Maintenance of Totally Idle Plant, Equipment, and Real Property. Don't pay for
   these costs from the DWCF. If DWCF operations use these items intermittently, maintenance
   is a proper DWCF expense.
   18.6.4. Operating and Maintaining Activities Located in the DWCF Activity but Not
   Helping to Produce or Sell Goods and Services. Don't use DWCF.
   18.6.5. Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Costs. Use the appropriate BRAC
   account to pay for costs of implementing BRAC Commission recommendations. Don't
   include in DWCF rates and costs.
   18.6.6. Claims for Damage to or Loss of Real or Personal Property Caused by Base or
   Contractor Personnel. Don't use DWCF for these costs.
   18.6.7. Any Major Catastrophe or Act of God. Don't use DWCF when the cost of repair
   or damage to DWCF assets is in excess of $750,000. Repairs in excess of $750,000 are
   funded with appropriated funds. Each repair project should reflect the restoration of a
   complete capability, i.e. repair of a hangar must include roofing, duct work, air conditioning
   repair, etc. These individual repairs shall not be separately evaluated against the $750,000
   threshold.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                          293


   18.6.8. War Reserve Materiel. DoD activities procure and maintain war reserves to meet
   wartime requirements as determined by the Defense Planning Guidance. Finance the initial
   procurement of war reserve material from a direct appropriation to the Fund, not through
   customer rates. However, because supply management businesses manage WRM, you must
   describe and justify war reserve requirements in DWCF budget estimates.
   18.6.9. Capital Assets Financed by Appropriations. Finance the following directly from
   appropriated funds rather than from DWCF resources.
      18.6.9.1. Fund military construction projects of $750,000 and over from the Military
      Construction appropriation.
      18.6.9.2. Exclude equipment in the following categories from the DWCF:
          18.6.9.2.1. Aircraft, ships, barges, and general-purpose passenger-type vehicles.
          DMAG purchases other support equipment.
          18.6.9.2.2. Equipment to meet mobilization requirements when no, or limited, peace
          application exists.
          18.6.9.2.3. Equipment normally provided as government-furnished equipment.
          18.6.9.2.4. Initial Lay-In of Depot Maintenance Capital Equipment. Continue to use
          the appropriate procurement Budget Program to finance the purchase and installation
          costs for initial procurement of depot maintenance capital equipment required to
          support and unique (i.e., Organic DMAG cannot satisfy with existing equipment) to
          newly introduced platforms or weapon systems, or modification programs. The
          procurement Budget Program will provide equipment for a capability which the WCF
          cannot support. For example, a depot may have paint booths, but if there is not
          enough excess capacity in the existing paint booths, then the procurement Budget
          Program will furnish the needed paint booths. The platform or weapon system
          program manager must ensure that the equipment and installation are programmed
          and budgeted in the proper appropriation for coordinating equipment requirements,
          specification, and delivery with the depot. Once transferred to or capitalized by the
          depot, the capital equipment becomes the depot's property. The depot will treat the
          equipment as a capital asset, depreciate the equipment, and fund subsequent
          replacement and maintenance of the equipment in its capital and operating budgets.
          18.6.9.2.5. Items that meet the DoD capitalization criteria for use by major ranges
          and test facility bases operating under the Defense Working Capital Fund.
      18.6.9.3. Exception to the self-insurance rule. Normally, when an asset is damaged, the
      owner of the asset will pay for the repairs or replacement of the damaged asset. However,
      when an asset is in Organic DMAG for repairs, Organic DMAG is responsible for the
      asset and will repair the asset unless paragraph 18.6.7 applies.
   18.6.10. Military Costs. Reimbursement from DWCF to APF is not required for military
   labor, which is not assigned to a DWCF billet, performing work for a DWCF activity, i.e.,
   military civil engineering craftsmen accomplishing work on a DWCF assigned facility.
18.7. Recognizing Revenue. To ensure consistency of "revenue recognition" in the Depot
Maintenance and Information Services Activity Groups for DoD end-products and to guarantee
that business areas' operating results are comparable:
 294                                                 AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   18.7.1. Use the percentage-of-completion method (cost to cost method) to recognize
   revenue.
   18.7.2. In all instances, you must transfer the portion of work in process associated with the
   revenue recognition to cost of goods sold. Bill the customer funding the order for the revenue
   recognized; or, when you have previously billed progress payments, record those payments
   to the appropriate revenue account.
   18.7.3. Bill customers and recognize revenue monthly.
   18.7.4. Don't allow the total amount of revenue recognized and billed to exceed the order
   amount.
18.8. Paying for Military Personnel. Use a consolidated DWCF payment to pay costs incurred
in common by multiple business areas or activities. An example is reimbursing the Military
Personnel appropriation for the cost of military people assigned to DWCF activities. Accumulate
and pay these costs at the corporate level but make sure each activity records them. They are as
much a cost of doing business as any local obligation. NOTE: Military personnel pricing
decision is that MILPERS costs will be priced at the civilian equivalent rates for the numbers of
budgeted military work years. The amount included in the budget for DWCF activities will be
the amount of expenses in execution and the amount reimbursed to the military personnel
appropriation. This is not applicable to the Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF).
18.9. Acquiring Capital Assets:
   18.9.1. Review each proposed acquisition of a capital asset to make sure it:
       18.9.1.1. Makes economic sense to buy rather than lease. Although leasing isn't part of
       the Capital Purchases Program, it may be appropriate for fast-changing technology or
       when workloads are expected to cease before the end of the program or payback period.
       You may also use leasing to improve productivity near-term until you can develop
       enough data to verify the benefits of procurement.
       18.9.1.2. Meets the Department's long-range planning and programming objectives and
       satisfies a documented need for capability to perform valid operations, function, or
       services that existing equipment and facilities or a contract can't do as well or as cheaply.
       18.9.1.3. Complies with policies governing acquiring and managing facilities, special
       tooling, and special test equipment (DoD Directive 4275.5, Acquisition and Management
       of Industrial Resources), as well as other policies on leasing and acquiring equipment and
       facilities.
   18.9.2. When you use workload projections to justify capital purchases, you must consider:
       18.9.2.1. Results of interservice decisions
       18.9.2.2. Workload posture planning decisions
       18.9.2.3. Readily available commercial alternatives
       18.9.2.4. Other reasonable options available for accomplishing applicable work load.
   18.9.3. The capital assets you recommend for acquisition must be the best alternative
   available to accomplish the objective for which you justify them. The criteria are:
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              295


     18.9.3.1. Improved efficiency (savings) or effectiveness.
     18.9.3.2. Required new capability and capacity that current equipment and facilities can't
     meet.
     18.9.3.3. Replacement of unsafe (locally determined), beyond economical repair, or
     inoperative unusable assets.
     18.9.3.4. Environmental, hazardous waste reduction, or regulatory agency (state, local,
     or Federal) mandated requirements.
  18.9.4. You must document the reasons (see DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 9)
  for a planned capital investment purchase and its expected benefits. Keep the documentation
  so it's readily available for review, audit, or evaluation. Use an economic analysis for projects
  with a total cost (funded and unfunded) of $1 million or more and use a cost analysis for
  projects with a total cost (funded and unfounded) of less than $1 million.
     18.9.4.1. Analyze each Capital Purchases Program category with an expected cost of
     $100,000 or more for improved productivity and for replacement items that can greatly
     outperform an existing item. EXCEPTION: environmental, hazardous waste reduction,
     or requirements mandated by a regulatory agency (state, local or Federal) including
     directed action by higher DoD or Component authority which doesn't allow a choice.
     18.9.4.2. Show your workload projections and the source or rationale for them. To show
     greater efficiency or effectiveness, you must analyze capital purchase based on present
     value. If you mainly intend to save money consider potential investments with the
     shortest payback period but balance savings against usefulness to the mission.
  18.9.5. Analyze results within 1 to 2 years after buying a capital item expected to cost
  $100,000 or more when you said the item would improve productivity or perform better than
  an item it replaced. You must finish the analysis within 3 years after completing the job order
  and installing the equipment, developing the software, completing the construction, etc. Keep
  a copy of this analysis of results with the pre-investment analysis. Include at least:
     18.9.5.1. The fiscal year of the President's Budget submission when the equipment,
     project, or reserve was approved, and the date when the equipment was installed.
     18.9.5.2. The equipment cost estimated in the initial President's Budget submission and
     the actual investment cost.
     18.9.5.3. The savings or cost avoidance estimated in the initial President's Budget
     submission and the actual savings (including unfunded costs) to date. Clearly
     differentiate between estimated and actual data.
     18.9.5.4. The estimated and actual number of months to amortize the investment cost
     (pay-back period); i.e., the time required for the accumulated saving or cost avoidance to
     equal the equipment cost.
     18.9.5.5. A brief narrative describing:
     18.9.5.6. The basis for determining the savings or cost avoidance, such as fewer people,
     reduced maintenance, equipment, works faster, more accurately, etc.
     18.9.5.7. When net savings or cost avoidance are expected to begin.
 296                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       18.9.5.8. Why actual savings or annual costs differ (show how much) from those
       estimated.
       18.9.5.9. A brief narrative providing, where applicable, the ways in which the new
       equipment met the intended objective -- improved the safety, quality or timeliness of the
       repair process; reduced the hazardous waste generated in a process; or improved morale
       (possibly verified by survey).

Section 18B—Guidance for Specific Business Areas

18.10. Depot Maintenance:
   18.10.1. Bill the Transportation Activity Group, the Materiel Support Division, the Air
   National Guard (ANG), the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), Foreign Military Sales
   (FMS), operational MAJCOMs, Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and other customers
   for depot maintenance services identified to a specific appropriation, fund or customer.
   18.10.2. Depot maintenance will develop rates and prices to charge customers the full cost of
   work performed, including recovery of accumulated profits and losses and any surcharge.
   18.10.3. Cite:
       18.10.3.1. DWCF depot maintenance and O&M, ANG funds on orders for area or base
       support.
       18.10.3.2. Central procurement funds (CP) appropriations on orders for local
       manufacture of investment items and for installing modifications.
       18.10.3.3. DWCF supply activity funds for repairing and manufacturing supply activity-
       owned items.
   18.10.4. Ensure the full cost of all work produced, including any adjustments needed to meet
   cash or capital budget requirements, are included in customer rates and prices.
       18.10.4.1. For each type of repair or service, such as exchangeables, AFMC develops a
       cost factor or uses other techniques equitable to all customers and recovers full costs of
       providing the repair or service.
       18.10.4.2. Sign an interservice support agreement (ISSA) with each customer. Document
       the basis of reimbursement (such as cost factors, etc.). Review the agreement annually to
       make sure the reimbursement factors are adequate. Follow procedures in DoD Instruction
       4000.19 and AFI 25-201.
18.11. Supply Management:
   18.11.1. The Supply Management Activity Group (formerly stock fund) repairs and buys
   materiel items from commercial or other government sources. The Materiel Support Division
   (MSD) primarily finances the repair and purchase of reparable items. Also, consumable items
   that did not transfer to the Defense Logistics Agency are managed under MSD. Supply
   Management customers will obligate their funds when they place orders with the DWCF.
   Customers will place orders only for supplies or equipment needed in the current fiscal year,
   or for supplies and equipment whose lead time requires obligation of current year funds to
   ensure they are available when needed.

  18.11.3. Apply this guidance for the Air Force Academy's (USAFA) Cadet Store Division:
     18.11.3.1. If the USAFA Superintendent considers it in the Air Force's interest to
     authorize the return of any item for which there is a future requirement, establish the
     amount of credit allowed, following general guidance on DWCF return credit. Instruct
     staff to apply the credit as a refund to cash purchases, to the individual's pay record, or to
     the returning appropriation, as appropriate.

18.12. Information Services Activity Group (ISAG).
   18.12.1. The Information Services Activity Group, Central Design Activities (CDAs) was
   established effective 1 October 1995 (FY96) under the authority of Section 2208 of title 10,
   U.S.C. Operations of the group are conducted in accordance with applicable Department of
   Defense (DoD) policies and regulations. There are two Air Force activities acting as one
   CDA. The two activities are the Materiel Systems Group (MSG) located at Wright-Patterson
   AFB, OH and the standard Systems Group located at Maxwell AFB – Gunter Annex, AL.
   The ISAG is authorized and provides through the CDAs the following information services
   activities: (1) Development and operational sustainment of automated information and
   communications systems on existing hardware and software platforms for Air Force Materiel
   Command Level Logistics support systems and Air Force Base Level standard support
   systems; (2) Automated information and communications systems requirements analysis,
   system design, development, testing, integration, implementation support, and documentation
   services on mainframe, mid-tier and personal computer hardware/software platforms for Air
   Force and DoD customers using the Software Engineering Institute Capability Maturity
   Model processes; (3) and other authorized information system services or products through
   the acquisition and operation of commercial Information Technology Product Area
   Directorate (CIT-PAD) commodity contracts for the Department of the Air Force and other
   agencies of the DoD. This portion of the ISAG is cost reimbursable through the collection of
   a surcharge on the orders submitted by the users of the contracts or blanket purchase
   authority. While the primary mission of providing CDA services is based on service level
   agreements (SLAs) with known customers and on sale of direct billable hours, the CIT-PAD
   portion provides goods and services, e.g., personal computers, local area network hardware
   and services including installations worldwide.
   18.12.2. Materiel Systems Group (MSG). MSG is responsible for requirements analysis,
   definition, planning, programming, development implementation, maintenance and re-
   engineering of information systems. MSG supports a broad base of Air Force-wide
   customers and other DoD customers. MSG provides cradle-to-grave information systems
   management which enables MSG to carry out its mission to provide the critical logistics
   information systems support necessary to keep Air Force units and weapon systems in a state
   of readiness and to sustain their operations during peace and war.
   18.12.3. Standard Systems Group. SSG is responsible for the development and
   operational sustainment of 130 Air Force standard systems. These systems include
   application and systems software running on mainframes, minicomputers, and/or
   microcomputer platforms. SSG provides services such as requirements definition, system
   design, development, testing, integration, implementation support and documentation
   services.

                OFFICIAL VISITS CONCERNING BUDGET MATTERS

19.1. Conducting Budget Liaison. SAF/FMB is official liaison on all budget matters between
the Air Force and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Office of the Secretary of
Defense (OSD), or the Appropriations and Budget Committees of the Congress. Follow this
guidance for reporting to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Financial Management,
Budget (SAF/FMB) official visits by representatives of these organizations to Air Force
commands, installations, and activities.
   19.1.1. For visits by members of Congress, see AFI 90-401.
   19.1.2. For visits by the Government Accountability Office (GAO, formally the General
   Accounting Office) officials, see AFI 65-401.
19.2. Notifying Budget Officials about Visits:
   19.2.1. Visits by Representatives of Congressional Appropriations and Budget
   Committees. SAF/FML (Budget Enactment Office) will announce visits to Directors of
   Financial Management and Comptroller, and others who need to know at command,
   installation, or activity. When representatives plan to visit activities below major command,
   (MAJCOM) SAF/FML will send a copy of the notification message to the MAJCOM's
   comptroller. If time is short, SAF/FML will telephone the Comptroller liaison at the HQ
   MAJCOM and confirm later in writing. Provide SAF/FML the name of your point of contact
   by message or telephone.
   19.2.2. Visits by House Appropriations Committee (HAC) Survey and Investigation
   (S&I) Staff. The headquarters Team Chief appointed by SAF/FML will notify commands of
   visits by members of the HAC S&I Staff. When visits are to activities below MAJCOM, send
   a copy of the notice to the MAJCOM's Comptroller and functional area. If time doesn't allow
   a message, telephone the MAJCOM and confirm later in writing.
   19.2.3. Visits by Representatives of OMB or OSD. The SAF/FMB directorate that
   handles the visit's subject matter will message the Comptroller of the appropriate command,
   installation or activity. When visits are to activities below MAJCOM, the directorate will
   send a copy of this message to the MAJCOM headquarters (Comptroller). If time doesn't
   allow a message, they will telephone the Comptroller liaison at MAJCOM, then confirm later
   in writing. Tell the SAF/FMB directorate (by message or telephone) of your point of contact
   for the visit.
19.3. Reporting Official Visits Concerning to Budget Matters:
   19.3.1. Reporting HAC S&I Staff Visits. Within 1 duty day after visit ends, or
   periodically if the S&I team is working on location, the main contact at the location should
   send a visit report to the Team Chief. If you're the contact, coordinate the report with your
   local comptroller. Send SAF/FML an information copy if an action affects the budget or
   includes something controversial.
   19.3.2. Reporting Visits by Representatives of OMB, OSD, or Congressional
   Appropriation and Budget Committees. Information discussed with or data provided to
 316                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   visitors that is considered to be of importance in current or future budget matters should be
   provided by fax, phone, or e-mail to SAF/ FML. Providing this information enables the Air
   Staff to correct problems during apportionment reviews, to discuss deficiencies or corrections
   with higher authorities. Present your information clearly and accurately. Information should
   show the source of information, time covered by data, and where relevant, how it applies to
   your requested, approved, or revised financial plans. Follow this same approach when citing
   any program or activity, such as flying hours, maintenance, or people programs.
   19.3.3. Reporting Additional Information. Send any requested additional information,
   within 5 days after submitting the report, to SAF/FMB. (Use a cover letter, refer to the
   original report of visit, and send it through channels.) Address HAC S&I's to the Team Chief.
19.4. Command Actions. Major and intermediate commands will review the reports and other
information for accuracy and completeness. In your Command's forwarding letter:
   19.4.1. Correct errors in the basic report.
   19.4.2. Clarify unusual problems or conditions.
   19.4.3. State corrective action being taken or recommended, or deficiencies found during the
   visits.
   19.4.4. Supplemental data or recommendations that helps SAF/FM understand the basic
   report.

1.          Charge any TDY costs for direct support to the project through an individual Work
Order.
2.          Calculate allowable In-House hours for this item by dividing budgeted amount by
appropriate shop rate. Monitor the hours charged; if you go over, ask for more obligation
authority through channels.
3.         Don't do a Work Order for In-House inspection if In-House forces do the
construction. The shop supervisor or superintendent, as necessary, will inspect.
4.      Base the RRI code to use on the PAC as follows: 72262=RA; 72271=RG;
72292=RN; 72266=RC; 72281=RK; 72296=RQ; 72267=RD; 72291=RM; 72297=RR
   21.2.5. Record these Project Costs:
         21.2.5.1. The Architect Engineer's (A-E) services and construction contracts.
         21.2.5.2. The Air Force BCE's direct labor hours for people who help design, manage the
         design, or manage construction of the project. Include people in support jobs, such as
         clerical and drafting. If the appropriate shop rate includes military costs, subtract it from
         the shop-rate cost to get reimbursable costs. Include the unfunded military cost in
         nonreimbursable project costs even though military people aren't actually used on the
         project.
         21.2.5.3. Government vehicles that directly support the housing project; leased vehicles;
         or mileage costs for civilian (privately-owned) vehicles where authorized and used
         instead of government vehicles.
            21.2.5.3.1. Include and reimburse costs for government vehicles under the shop-rate
            distribution; don't record costs elsewhere.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              323


          21.2.5.3.2. Directly cite project construction (P-71X) funds when civilian mileage
          costs are authorized. Establish a BCE work order to account for funds paid.
          21.2.5.3.3. Directly cite project construction funds (P-71X) when government
          vehicles aren't available and you're authorized to lease vehicles for direct support of
          housing projects. Establish a BCE work order number and include it in the
          procurement documentation.
      21.2.5.4. Printing and reproduction charges directly related to the project.
      21.2.5.5. TDY expenses directly related to the project for military personnel or civilian
      employees.
      21.2.5.6. All direct and non-BCE costs shown in Figure 21.2
      21.2.5.7. Government-furnished material and equipment.
      21.2.5.8. Figure 21.2 shows budget projects, account codes and types of costs for MFH
      construction.

       (The Air Force would incur these costs whether or not the Air Force or another
       construction agent designed or constructed the housing).
       21.2.6.2. The time of base staff for planning contracts, determining policy, or discussing
       other matters.
   21.2.7. Identifying Project Costs. Classify construction and improvement project costs
   (paragraph 21.2.5) as funded or unfunded.
       21.2.7.1. Funded Project Costs. Count these toward the statutory limit on the project's
       programmed amount. Funded costs include:
          21.2.7.1.1. Construction Contract Costs. Directly cite P-711 or P-713 funds.

          21.2.7.1.3. Contingency. Directly cite P-711 or P-713 funds.
          21.2.7.1.4. Supervision, Inspection, and Overhead (SIOH) Costs. Reimburse from P-
          711 or P-713 funds.

     21.2.7.2. Unfunded Project Costs. Count these costs toward the total project cost.
     However, don't count unfunded costs toward the statutory limit on the project's
     programmed amount.
        21.2.7.2.1. BCE's direct SIOH (nonreimbursable) costs for managing construction
        (labor and materiel). For funded labor costs, use the shop rate(s) less the military cost.
        21.2.7.2.2. Title I - A&E Design Service Fee. Directly cite P-714 funds.
        21.2.7.2.3. Title II - A&E Fee. Directly cite P-711 or P-713 funds.
        21.2.7.2.4. BCE's direct costs for in-service design (labor and materiel). Use the shop
        rate cost less the military cost.
        21.2.7.2.5. Base-level TDY expenses directly related to the MFH project for military
        personnel and civilian employees.
        21.2.7.2.6. Direct, non-BCE, costs of procurement, accounting and finance, and legal
        functions directly related to the MFH project. (NOTE: don't reimburse military
        labor.)
        21.2.7.2.7. Printing and reproduction.
  21.2.8. Establishing and Administering Work Orders:
     21.2.8.1. Civil Engineering Financial Management will establish separate work orders
     for design and construction to record costs of BCE and non-BCE functions. If you have a
     base operating instruction for project management, show how non-BCE people will get
     complete, accurate data for time and other costs to the BCE. If available, use actual costs
     for all BCE and non-BCE functions.
     21.2.8.2. Design costs start when you've received a design instruction from MAJCOM or
     HQ USAF. Write work orders to collect all design costs, as shown below. Close them
     when design is complete and approved.
        21.2.8.2.1. Contract work order for A&E design services.
        21.2.8.2.2. In-house work order for BCE's direct (in-house) design and Supervision
        Inspection Overhead (SIOH).
        21.2.8.2.3. Non-BCE work order for non-BCE direct costs.
     21.2.8.3. Start work orders for construction when you receive procurement directives
     from MAJCOM or HQ USAF. Collect all costs for construction management (inspection,
     etc.) and close them when you receive final payment and reporting of all in-house labor.
     The BCE will determine how often to submit non-BCE and other costs. You may use the
     Schedule of Reimbursements and Refunds to charge accumulated BCE and non-BCE
     costs to the MFH appropriation. Maintain the integrity of codes for Budget Authorization
     Account Numbers (BAAN) from the beginning of design through final close-out. Apply
     these requirements to:
        21.2.8.3.1. Contract work order for the construction contract and Title II Inspection.
        21.2.8.3.2. BCE's direct and SIOH costs for In-house work orders.
        21.2.8.3.3. Non-BCE work order for non-BCE direct costs.

          21.2.8.3.4. Government-furnished material work order.

Section 21C—Military Family Housing Operation and Maintenance Account (MFH O&M,
57*7045) (NOTE: For FY 01 and prior, use pseudo-symbols 57*7045 or 7040. For FY 02 and
out, use symbols 57*0745 or 0740. (See paragraph 21.18)

21.3. Charging Costs to MFH O&M:
   21.3.1. Include these costs:
       21.3.1.1. Civilian Personnel Costs. Administer reimbursable personnel costs directly
       supporting the MFH property account and MFH management offices. To compute federal
       labor costs for civilians use actual payroll costs, plus actual cost of benefits, or WIMS
       shop rates. If WIMS shop rates include military pay, don't charge that cost to MFH
       O&M. Military pay isn't reimbursable.
          21.3.1.1.1. Limit administrative and supervisory costs to those incurred at installation
          level.
          21.3.1.1.2. Compute labor costs, (both direct and indirect hire) for foreign nationals
          using local wage rates and total cost to the federal government. Total cost includes
          government contributions for employee benefits.
          21.3.1.1.3. Charge civilian labor costs based on the actual work effort applied to
          MFH units, equipment, furnishings, fixtures, or housing areas. When WIMS is in
          operation, charge the labor costs to MFH using WIMS shop rates. (Examples of
          chargeable civilian labor are: Quality Assurance Evaluators; Special offices for
          managing GOQ; managing offices for MFH; Planning and Design Costs; In-house
          maintenance, repair, and minor alteration or improvement costs.)
          21.3.1.1.4. Organizations other than civil engineering (for example, Security Forces
          or Contracting) charge indirect costs for labor that supports Family Housing (FH)
          only when FH activities earn manpower authorizations on the Unit Manning
          Document. Charge such costs only if multiples of one or more personnel are earned
          and not a fraction thereof.
       21.3.1.2. Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel. Include all travel costs incurred at an
       installation for operating, administering, and supervising MFH activities. Usually, you'll
       directly cite rather than reimburse these costs to MFH funds. SAF/FMB Sep 7, 1995
       memo, Subject: Use of Military Family Housing Funds for Support Personnel Travel and
       Training, states, ―the Air Force will use the MFH Operations & Maintenance 0745
       account as the sole account to fund MFH travel and training activities in direct support of
       the family housing program.‖ This is applicable to MAJCOMs, as well as, installations.
       Additionally, it states, ―The O&M 3400 account will no longer be utilized for these
       costs.‖ This prohibition on the use of the O&M 3400 account is to avoid a violation of the
       election rule in The Principles of Federal Appropriations Law that could result in an
       ADA violation.
       21.3.1.3. Transportation. Either directly cite MFH funds or reimburse the account you
       first charged. Use the direct citation for MFH funds when you can separately identify
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             327


     contracts. Apply the reimbursable method when you use in-house resources to perform
     services. Pay for the following types of transportation costs from MFH:
        21.3.1.3.1. Moving and handling costs for MFH furniture, furnishings, and
        appliances.
        21.3.1.3.2. General Services Administration surcharge for overseas packing and
        crating when MFH requisitions items directly from GSA (i.e., when the order isn't
        placed through the stock fund).
     21.3.1.4. Vehicle Costs. Charge for direct support only. For government-owned
     vehicles, use cost data from the On-Line Vehicle Interactive Management System cost
     data and charge as a reimbursable. Directly cite MFH funds for contract-vehicle rentals.
     21.3.1.5. Leases. Usually, you should directly cite lease costs. Include rental of dwelling
     units and other structures that support only MFH activities. When MFH and other base
     activities share leased facilities, determine a fair share of the leased cost based on square
     feet used by each activity. Compute the shared rate (expressed as a percent of the total
     lease cost) before the beginning of each fiscal year (FY), to cover 1 October through 30
     September. Charge the MFH share to MFH O&M. When shared use changes
     significantly, you may negotiate a new agreement for the balance of the FY.
     21.3.1.6. Utility Services. Use either direct citation or reimbursements to administer
     costs. Use direct citation when you can identify costs separately. Base charges on meter
     readings or engineering analysis (see AFI 32-5007). Whenever sewage metering or
     contract terms don't permit direct measurement, use 70 percent of water consumed to
     determine sewage quantity. If the resulting figure (i.e., 70 percent of the water consumed
     within military family housing, compared with total base sewage disposed of) is illogical,
     use the ratio of water MFH consumes to the total water consumed by the sewage-disposal
     plant.
     21.3.1.7. Contractual Services. Costs may include any service contracts or
     maintenance and repair contracts applicable to MFH property. Directly cite funds
     whenever you can separately identify contracts. When you can't, charge MFH as a
     reimbursable. Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2829, contracts can be made for periods
     of up to four years for supplies and services for the management, maintenance, and
     operation of military family housing and may pay for the costs of each year out of annual
     appropriations for that year. In other words, the entire contract (2,3, or 4 years) may not
     be funded using the fiscal year funds available when the contract is signed. The funds in
     each of the fiscal years in which the supplies or services are provided must be used to pay
     that fiscal year’s bill.
     21.3.1.8. Facility Projects. Directly cite these costs.
     21.3.1.9. Expense Materiel, Equipment, and Appliances. Directly cite MFH funds
     whenever possible. Base MFH costs on purchase price, standard price, or shop rates, as
     appropriate. Directly cite MFH funds for contract rentals of equipment that directly
     supports MFH.
     21.3.1.10. Procurement of Flags for Military Family Housing Units. MFH Operation
     and Maintenance (O&M)) funds may be used to purchase and install flags for military
 328                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       family housing units. However, ONLY U.S. (American), combatant command, Service,
       and host nation flags may be procured and installed using MFH O&M funds, and ONLY
       two flags total per unit. For example, a U.S. flag (American) and an Army flag may be
       procured and installed on a MFH unit with MFH O&M, but NOT aslo a combatant
       command flag. Purchase of General Officer flags for MFH units is not authorized
       because General Officers are entitled to one flag at promotion. Purchase of state,
       MAJCOM, and other organizational flags for military housing units is a personal
       expense of the member and may not be purchased with MFH O&M or other
       appropriated funds. While this policy allows for purchase and installation of U.S.,
       combatant command, Service, and host nation flags on MFH units, it is highly
       recommended that MAJCOMs restrict the purchase and installation of MFH
       O&M-funded flags to key representational and Command billets. All MAJCOMs
       should use discretion in implementing this policy as prudent custodians of public funds.
   21.3.2. Exclude these costs:
       21.3.2.1. Military Personnel Services. Record costs to MFH in a memorandum account.
       When using WIMS shop rates, exclude only military pay, not the entire shop rate.
       21.3.2.2. Indirect labor costs (such as administrative, clerical or supervisory) because
       you normally can't accumulate them.
       21.3.2.3. Costs from exception time accounting (ETA) Cost Centers, including indirect
       costs for civilian labor. EXCEPTION: see 21.3.1.1.3.
       21.3.2.4. Transportation costs for moving personally-owned property when someone gets
       an assignment or leaves public quarters for the government's convenience. For permanent
       changes of station, charge costs to the appropriation in the order. Otherwise charge them
       to the O&M-type fund cite provided by your base family housing management office.
       21.3.2.5. Temporary moves from MFH at the government's convenience (see AFI 32-
       6001).
21.4. Budget Program 720, Operation and Maintenance. Include these costs in Budget
Program 720 (AFMAN 65-604 has detailed Budget Project (BP) descriptions).
   21.4.1. Budget Project 721, Operations. Besides the items described in AFMAN 65-604,
   include costs for:
       21.4.1.1. Reimbursements to other federal government agencies for MFH units. (NOTE:
       OMB requires rental payments at full market rates on houses federal agencies own.)
       21.4.1.2. Equipment rental.
       21.4.1.3. Transportation.
       21.4.1.4. Required surveys and preliminary contract studies on engineering construction
       plans made before the Office of the Secretary of Defense approves a project.
       21.4.1.5. Inspecting construction, contracting services, and administrating project under
       build-to-lease, rental guarantees or private-sector financing.
       21.4.1.6. Nominal rent charges paid to foreign governments for surplus housing.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            329


      21.4.1.7. Maintaining, repairing, and replacing of domestic freestanding appliances (not
      installed).
   21.4.2. Budget Project 722, Maintenance of Real Property Facilities (In-House or by
   Contract). Besides the items described in AFMAN 65-604 include:
      21.4.2.1. Statutory Restriction. The Military Construction Appropriations Act of
      FY 2000 (P.L. 106-52, Sec. 128) directs that “funds appropriated in the Military
      Construction Appropriations Acts for operation and maintenance of family housing
      shall be the exclusive source of funds for repair and maintenance of all family
      housing units, including flag and general officer quarters. It further directs that unless
      there is a specific exception requested for a unit in the President’s Budget justification
      ―not more than $25,000 per unit (subsequently increased to $35,000 by FY 02
      MILCON Appropriations Act, Sec. 127 (P.L. 107-64)) may be spent annually for the
      maintenance and repair of any general or flag officer quarters without 30 days advance
      prior notification of the appropriate committees of Congress‖ (See AFI 32-6002, Family
      Housing Planning, Programming, Design, and Construction).
      21.4.2.2. Funding Military Family Housing Units Temporarily Diverted for Use as
      Unaccompanied Housing. Unless a unit is permanently taken out of service and
      removed from the family housing property records, it remains as family housing
      regardless of its temporary use as unaccompanied housing. Only MFH O&M funds
      may be used for repair and maintenance of a temporarily diverted unit, not regular
      base O&M funds.
      21.4.2.3. Prewiring or relocating telephone terminals (outlets) per living unit, with minor
      alterations or with maintenance and repair projects.
      21.4.2.4. Authorized repairing or maintaining of government-owned telephone wiring.
      21.4.2.5. Maintaining, repairing, and replacing of installed appliances.
      21.4.2.6. Designing and inspecting P-722 facility projects (see Figure 21.1).
      21.4.2.7. Turnover maintenance including cleaning of MFH units when occupants
      change.

   (Operations) and 724 (Maintenance) (See details in AFMAN 65-604).
   21.4.4. Budget Projects 725 and 726, Leased MFH, Domestic. Use projects 725
   (Operations) and 726 (Maintenance) (See details in AFMAN 65-604 ).
   21.4.5. Budget Project 727, Housing Privatization. Include all costs to develop, evaluate,
   and oversee privatization projects, including the cost of consultants hired to assist in these
   efforts (Included in AFMAN 65-604).
   21.4.6. Budget Project 728, Utilities. Include all utilities consumed in government-owned
   MFH as authorized in AFI 32-5007, Utility Services. (See AFMAN 65-604 for details).
21.5. Limiting Spending:
   21.5.1. Alterations. Follow AFI 32-6002 for minor alterations under BPs 722.
   21.5.2. Limitations. See AFI 32-6002 for limitations on all cost elements.
 330                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   21.5.3. Maximum Annual Lease Costs. Check the Military Construction Authorization
   Act for changes to maximum costs per unit for leased MFH.
21.6. Transferring and Reprogramming Funds:
   21.6.1. You transfer funds between Element of Expense Investment Codes (EEICs) within
   each BP except when the issuer imposes limitations, administrative ceilings, or "floors" on
   the AF Form 1449, Operating Budget Authority.
   21.6.2. MAJCOM budget offices may reprogram up to 10 percent within and between
   Budget Projects for Operations (including P-721 sub-accounts), Maintenance, and Utilities
   through the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, forward reprogramming requests through
   command channels to SAF/ FMBIC and HQ USAF/ILEHO for prior approval and action.
   Report excess funds promptly through channels for reprogramming actions.
   21.6.3. Funds may be reprogrammed between the leasing sub-accounts (P723, P725, and
   P726) without SAF/FMBIC and/or AF/ILEHO prior approval. The leasing overall total
   must not be exceeded. If requirements increase or decrease within the leasing sub-accounts,
   identify your changes to SAF/ FMBIC and AF/ILEHO. A revised budget authority document
   will be provided by SAF/FMBIC to change your leasing overall total. Only SAF/FMBIC
   can reprogram funds out of or into the leasing account.
21.7. Obligating Funds for Materiel. Make sure funds are available when you order furniture
and appliances. Record obligations when DWCF accepts your order.
21.8. Buying Washers and Dryers in Continental United States (CONUS). See AFI 32-
6004.
21.9. Buying Tableware for Special Command Positions. Use appropriated funds to issue
and replace tableware items (linens, dishes, glassware, silver, or kitchen utensils) in Table of
Allowance (TA) 106 only for those in special command positions as shown in DoDD 1100.12.
and under Public Law (10 U.S.C. 2387). The 1100 Supply Squadron, Bolling AFB, DC,
203325000, funds these items centrally.
21.10. Paying Taxes. Don't use the MFH appropriation to pay real-estate taxes to foreign
governments.
21.11. Providing Common-Service and Interagency Support for MFH Occupancy and
Services. Apply the following guidance.
   21.11.1. Occupancy by People Not in the USAF. The Air Force must operate and maintain
   all MFH units it owns, regardless of occupancy by other than Air Force people (see
   paragraph 21.12).
   21.11.2. Common Service. Don't charge or collect reimbursements when military members
   of one DoD component occupy housing owned by another component. Occupancy of MFH
   units within DoD isn't chargeable.
   21.11.3. Support Agreements. Establish a local agreement for interservice support when
   other agencies (Air Force organizations and non-DoD government agencies) occupy MFH.
   The Coast Guard is an example.
       21.11.3.1. Charge billings received for Air Force occupancy of non-DoD federal
       government housing (such as VA and FHA) to BP 721, EEIC 599.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                          331


      21.11.3.2. Credit proceeds from occupancy of leased units to BP 723/725, Operation of
      Leased Foreign/Domestic MFH.
      21.11.3.3. Credit proceeds received from non-DoD agencies occupying Air Force family
      housing per paragraph 21.16.
   21.11.4. Quarters Allowances. Stop paying quarters allowances to people who receive
   MFH, except when the housing is substandard (see DoD Military Pay Manual).
   21.11.5. Utilities and Maintenance. Reimburse for these services when one service or
   agency provides them to support the MFH owned by another service or agency..
21.12. Charging for Occupancy of MFH by Contractors and Other Nonmilitary People:
   21.12.1. Nonmilitary People. The Financial Services Office (FSO) will collect rent due
   from nonmilitary people (such as recently separated members) occupying Air Force MFH,
   except that appropriated funded Federal civilian employees may authorize a payroll
   deduction for the rent. Credit proceeds from these occupants per Section 21E.
   21.12.2. Employees of the American Red Cross (ARC). Treat ARC employees the same
   as employees under appropriated funds for assigning and occupying MFH overseas. ARC
   employees in the CONUS, United States' territories, and possessions must pay a rental charge
   based on the rates charged for comparable private rental housing nearby (AFI 32-9003).
   Don't charge rental at foreign locations (AFI 36-3105). Credit proceeds from these occupants
   per Section 21E.
   21.12.3. Employees of the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES). Reimburse
   the MFH account for MFH rent and utilities furnished to qualifying AAFES employees.
   (Overseas AAFES employees not paid from appropriated funds are nonappropriated fund
   employees (NAF category 1, MWR activity) for MFH occupancy.) In Europe, centrally bill
   to AAFESEUR. In the Pacific area, local AAFES managers and FSOs should coordinate and
   establish procedures for collecting rental charges. Credit proceeds from these occupants per
   Section 21E.
21.13. Occupying Substandard Housing:
   21.13.1. Military Personnel (P. L. 85241). Military personnel may rent inadequate
   quarters, but if in substandard condition, then the following applies:
      21.13.1.1. Pay the member the net difference between the basic allowance for housing
      (BAH) and the fair rental value of the quarters not to exceed 75 percent of the member’s
      BAH. Pay this difference, as BAH, from the Military Personnel (MILPERS), Air Force,
      appropriation. The adjusted BAH is the only charge to the MILPERS appropriation.
      ("Fair Rental Value" is the gross charge for occupying quarters, including charges for
      utility services (except telephone) and furniture when provided (see AFI 32-6001).
      21.13.1.2. Don't reimburse the person, the MFH, or any other account from the
      MILPERS appropriation.
      21.13.1.3. Don't make cash or payroll collections from United States military occupants
      of substandard housing.
 332                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   21.13.2. Civilian Employees. Civilian occupants must pay cash monthly or authorize a
   payroll deduction equal to the fair rental value of the occupied quarters. Don't reduce civilian
   salary reports for occupying of MFH units. Credit the proceeds per Section 21E.

Section 21D—Debt Payments

21.14. Charging the Debt Payment Program. Use this program to pay:
   21.14.1. Principal and Interest. Monthly payments of principal and interest on Capehart
   and Wherry MFH projects to mortgage holders.

   premiums, for military personnel, on private homes they're purchasing. (NOTE: Program
   was discontinued for new applications in FY 1980.)
   21.14.4. Deferrals. Payment of deferred receipts to the mortgage.
21.15. Administering and Controlling Debt Payments:
   21.15.1. SAF/FMB:
       21.15.1.1. Reviews the initial budget and financial plan submissions and resolves
       differences.
       21.15.1.2. Prepares budget justification to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).

   21.15.2. 1100 Resources Management Group, Bolling AFB DC 20332-5000:
       21.15.2.1. Administers funds for principal and interest payments to holders of Capehart
       and Wherry mortgages; pays fees for resident agents and filing corporate reports, and
       pays franchise taxes.
       21.15.2.2. Reports monthly status of budget borrowing and deferred receipt accounts to
       DFAS-DE/AR for transmission to the Department of the Treasury.
       21.15.2.3. Accounts for receipt of funds sent through the Office of the Secretary of
       Defense, Comptroller (OSD(C)), from the sales of Air Force excess MFH units. Applies
       deferred receipts as principal payments to the mortgage account. After principal is
       eliminated, SAF/FMBI and AF/ ILEH will direct fund expenditure in accordance with
       procedures in 10 U.S.C. 2831.
       21.15.2.4. Develops interest and other expense on Capehart and Wherry units for FYDP.
       21.15.2.5. Develops other budget data "as required" for the Air Staff, the OSD, and

21.16. Reimbursing MFH. Reimburse the following revenues to Budget Program (BP) 720,
Operation and Maintenance. See paragraph 21.17 for exceptions. Credit reimbursements for
rental proceeds to the most beneficial BP (determined at installation level) unless otherwise
specified. Use EEIC 599. NOTE: process as refunds to MFH O&M payments from people for
loss, damage, or destruction to MFH facilities or furnishings caused by abuse or negligence of
the member, or dependent, guest.
   21.16.1. Amounts received for supporting MFH units owned by another service or agency.

   21.16.5. Utility collections for privately-owned mobile homes on government-owned land,
   which aren't individually metered or billed directly to the occupant.
   21.16.6. Charges levied for locating, siting, and connecting utilities to privately-owned
   mobile homes on government-owned land.
   21.16.7. Payments from foreign governments and international organizations sponsoring
   people who occupy MFH units, including sale of services charged to MFH. Apply
   accessorial charges to issues, sales, or transfers of furniture and appliances to non-Air Force
   activities. Accessorial charges consist of packing, handling, and crating costs; positioning
   costs; and transportation costs for inland shipments, including parcel post.
21.17. Determining Other Reimbursements:
   21.17.1. When a sales agreement requires proceeds from selling excess MFH units to be
   applied to a note owed by the Air Force, reimburse the proceeds to Air Force account
   57*0745 for retiring debt. When the sales agreement doesn't include the request, deposit sales
   proceeds to the annual MFH O&M account designated by SAF/FMBIC and AF/ILEH.
   21.17.2. Deposit proceeds from renting and handling of excess MFH units, less expenses for
   operating and maintaining this property, to the DoD parent account, 97*7065.1100C990-
   3200-49156.
   21.17.3. If you have rental housing that includes government-owned furniture or appliances,
   reimburse the total combined charge to the same account prescribed for rentals of that

21.18. Use of Treasury Symbols for FY 02 and Out; Use of Special Air Force Working
(pseudo) Symbols for FY 01 and Prior.
   21.18.1. Beginning with FY 02, the Air Force will no longer use pseudo-symbols for
   Military Housing appropriations. For FY 02 and out, the symbol for Military Family
   Housing, Construction will be 57*0740 and for Military Family Housing, O&M 57*0745.
   However, when citing FY 01 and prior Military Family Housing funds, use 57*7040 for
   construction and 57*7045 for O&M.

                           CIVILIAN PERSONNEL SERVICES

22.1. Overview. Within fund limitations, the Air Force uses in-service civilian personnel and
contract services to complete workloads that don't require military incumbents.
22.2. Coordinating      Personnel     Authorizations      and    Workyears      with     Fund
Authorizations. HQ USAF and MAJCOMs must coordinate funding and manpower
authorization documents before issuing them. All echelons of command must include funds to
adequately cover planned civilian employment levels in your operating budget authorities
(OBAs) and fund allocations or allotments. In determining employment levels, managers must
consider manpower authorizations, funding priorities, employment capability, lapse (the length
of time vacated positions are normally vacant), and overhire requirements. Use current average
annual salaries and known or projected pay raises in pricing the civilian employment program.
Pay personnel from the same appropriation and program element in which manpower spaces are
authorized. Coordinate fund authorizations and planned employment levels by developing
financed civilian workyear utilization/employment plans under the direction of the civilian
employment and cost management committee (or a similar group as a Corporate Board).
22.3. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Travel:
   22.3.1. Don't apply the guidance in this paragraph to travel for security assistance programs,
   which is covered in Chapter 17.
   22.3.2. The Joint Travel Regulation (JTR), Volume 2, prescribes the activity responsible for
   paying authorized direct travel and transportation expenses. Charge these expenses to the
   same appropriation and budget activity from which you pay the employee's salary.
       22.3.2.1. Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) is responsible for funding PCS
       expenses for transportation by Military Sealift Command (MSC) of civilian personal
       effects.
       22.3.2.2. HQ Air Mobility Command (AMC) centrally funds transportation of
       unaccompanied          baggage and household goods on aircraft operated under the
       Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF). Unaccompanied baggage arriving at an
       aerial port without funding authorization for further movement is held a maximum of 7
       days, during which time tracer action by most expeditious means (message, telephone,
       etc.) must be initiated to obtain funding authorization. If you don't obtain funding
       authorization within the 7-day period, initiate onward shipment citing operation and
       maintenance (O&M) type funds of the organization which has custody of the baggage.
       When proper funding data is obtained, reimburse or refund the prior charge (as required),
       considering the $500 waiver policy.
       22.3.2.3. See DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations regarding the
       fiscal year to be charged for travel expenses.
22.4. Paying Civilian Personnel Working on Major Repair Projects. Charge the pay of
personnel engaged in maintenance and repair projects and in the design and inspection of
construction projects to elements of expense (EEIC) for civilian pay (39X) under O&M type
appropriations. EXCEPTION:
 336                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   22.4.1. Military Family Housing (MFH) Account, Construction Projects. Charge all
   personnel costs incurred for MFH new construction to Budget Program 710. While you may
   hire personnel solely for this work and directly cite Budget Program 710 for their payroll
   costs, you should usually charge these personnel services to the base O&M type
   appropriation. Then, you must reimburse the base O&M type appropriation from Budget
   Program 710, as follows:
       22.4.1.1. For direct civilian personnel services, include actual payroll costs plus actual
       cost of benefits.
       22.4.1.2. For foreign national labor services (local wage rate), you must reimburse for
       both direct and indirect hire labor, at 100 percent of total labor costs (BCE and non-
       BCE), including government contributions for employee benefits.
       22.4.1.3. For bases operating under the Interim Work Information Management System
       (WIMS), which will eventually be replaced by the Automated Civil Engineer System
       (ACES), charge the labor costs to MFH at the shop rate prescribed by that system.
       NOTE: If the shop rate includes military labor costs, record it as an unfunded cost.
   22.4.2. Expense of Operating and Maintaining Military Family Housing. The Base
   Civil Engineer (BCE) and other organizations usually provide civilian personnel services and
   initially finance them from base O&M funds. You must reimburse from Budget Program
   720, as follows:
       22.4.2.1. For Air Force civilian Personnel in direct support of the MFH property account
       and MFH management, include actual payroll costs plus the actual cost of benefits.
       22.4.2.2. For foreign national labor services (local wage rate), reimburse for both direct
       and indirect hire at 100 percent of total labor costs (BCE and non-BCE), including
       government contributions for employee benefits.
       22.4.2.3. For bases operating under the work information management system (WIMS),
       charge the labor costs to MFH at the prescribed shop rates. NOTE: If the shop rate
       includes military labor costs, record it as an unfunded cost.
   22.4.3. Military Construction Projects. Charge civilian personnel services (in-house or
   contract) required for in-house design and inspection of construction projects to O&M-type
   funds.
   22.4.4. Pay of Other Government Agency Personnel. Treat services provided by district
   engineers or other government agencies as contractual services. Program and finance them
   under the element of expense codes for design and construction.
22.5. Awards Guidance. For Suggestion Awards, see AFI 38-401. AFI 36-1001 and AFI 36-
1004 provide guidance pertaining to civilian performance awards. Also see Chapter 4, Section
4L of this instruction.
22.6. Pay of Civilian Personnel Employed in Certain Specialized Functions. Follow this
guidance in charging for salaries in the following specialized functions:
   22.6.1. Service Club and Library Personnel. Use appropriated funds to pay salaries,
   including assistants, when manpower authorization documents include these authorizations.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                           337


   22.6.2. Dining Hall Personnel. You may establish civilian authorizations for dining hall
   personnel, such as cooks, bakers, and mess attendants according to AFI 34-239, Food Service
   Management Program, subject to availability of appropriate funds and following AFI 38-
   201.
   22.6.3. Auxiliary Civilian Chaplains. Commanders of Air Force activities, with the
   coordination and approval of Wing Chaplains, may authorize and appoint auxiliary civilian
   chaplains when necessary. Use base O&M funds (AFI 52-101).
   22.6.4. Property Disposal Program. Charge the pay of Air Force civilian employees
   assigned to O&M activities, who perform services directly related to preparing and disposing
   of scrap, salvage, excess, surplus, or foreign excess personal property, to the appropriation
   from which you usually pay the employee. DFAS-DE centrally administers reimbursement
   for these services, according to Chapter 10, Section 10D.
22.7. Subsistence and Quarters to Civilian Employees. AFI 34-246 contains guidance on
furnishing subsistence and quarters to civilian employees and related charges. Make collections
from the employee either in cash or by payroll deduction. (See Chapter 21 for collecting rent).
   22.7.1. Collecting for Subsistence. Payrolls for civilian employees subsisting in Air Force
   messes are stated in the gross amount. Collect the cost of subsistence in cash or by payroll
   deduction. In developing civilian pay budgets, you must provide for the total salary of the
   employee.
   22.7.2. Collecting for Utilities. Handle utility charges collected by payroll deductions as
   stoppages; that is, charge the gross salary to the appropriation from which the employee is
   paid and credit the amount representing collection for utility services to the appropriation
   available for supply of the utility services. Administer cash collections the same way. In
   either case, provide for the total salary of the employee in your budgets.
22.8. Witness and Jury Fees. Employees must turn in to their agencies all jury and witness
fees paid to them by state and municipal courts while on court leave from their agencies, except
when such payments are "reimbursement for expenses" rather than "fees."
   22.8.1. Deposit jury fees turned over to the Air Force by employees as refunds to the
   appropriation or funds from which the employee was paid.
   22.8.2. Deposit witness fees turned over to the Air Force to the credit of receipt account
   573099, miscellaneous recoveries and refunds not otherwise classified.
22.9. LumpSum Leave Payment. If an employee refunds a lump sum leave payment upon
reemployment during the period covered by the payment, accomplish the refund either by cash
collection or by payroll deduction. In either case, credit the collection as a refund to the
appropriation that pays the employee.
22.10. Unliquidated Leave. Collect the value of unearned advanced leave upon separation, or
unliquidated overdrawn leave at the end of a calendar year, from the employee concerned by
cash, payroll deduction, or refund from any amount due or which may become due to the
employee from the United States. Refund cash collections to the appropriation originally
charged. Payroll deductions simply reduce the amount of the employee's current pay.
22.11. Travel OverAdvances. Under conditions specified in JTR, volume 2, an employee may
receive a travel expense advance. Usually, the advance is repaid by deduction from
 338                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


reimbursement due for travel. If this isn't possible (for example, when the advance exceeds the
amount due), the employee must repay the amount over-advanced. If cash collection efforts are
unsuccessful, make a payroll deduction. Treat the collection as an appropriation refund to the
appropriation originally charged.
22.12. Reimbursement of Professional Liability Insurance Premiums. Section 636 of the
Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1997, as
amended by Section 642 of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government
Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000, requires agencies to reimburse qualified employees for
not to exceed one-half of the costs incurred for professional liability insurance. DoD further
restricts reimbursement to a maximum of $150 per year from the account the employee receives
their salary. Employees eligible to receive reimbursement are law enforcement officers and
supervisors and management officials. Eligible employees include civilians paid from
appropriated and working capital fund activities. Non-Appropriated Fund and Military
Appropriation funded employees are not eligible for reimbursement.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                          339


                                         Chapter 23

         BASE CLOSURE AND REALIGNMENT (BRAC) APPROPRIATIONS

Section 23A—Appropriation Structure and Data Codes

23.1. BRAC Appropriations. Financing may come from appropriations, transfers in
appropriations acts, and proceeds from the sale of assets made available from Base Realignments
and Closures.
   23.1.1. BRAC 88 (Round I). Appropriation 97*/50103.1102, Fund Code 20, Base Closure
   Account (BRAC 88), authorizes recommendations of the 1988 Base Closure Commission.
   Funds appropriated for this account were available for new obligation through FY 1995. The
   following are bases designated for closure or realignment under BRAC 88:

      Chanute AFB IL
      George AFB CA
      Mather AFB CA

      Eaker AFB AK                 Rickenbacker (ANG) AFB OH
      England AFB LA               Richards Gebaur AFB MO
      Grissom AFB IN               Williams AFB AZ
      Loring AFB ME                Wurtsmith AFB MI


   23.1.3. BRAC 93 (Round III). Appropriation 97X0510.1632,, Fund Code 5F, DoD Base
   Closure and Realignment Account, Part II (BRAC 93) funds closure and realignment costs
   associated with actions recommended by the 1993 Base Closure Commission created under
   the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (Title 29 of Public Law 101-510).
 340                                             AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   The funds appropriated in this account are available for obligation until expended. The
   following are bases designated for closure or realignment under BRAC 93:

       Griffiss AFB NY             March AFB CA
       Homestead AFB FL            Plattsburgh AFB NY
          K. I. Sawyer AFB MI          Newark AFB OH
          O'Hare IL                    Gentile AFB OH


   23.1.4. For O'Hare AFB, IL, the BRAC 93 Commission authorized the county to relocate
   the existing reserve unit at their own expense and directed that no BRAC funds be expended
   for this move.
   23.1.5. BRAC 95 (Round IV). Appropriation 97X0510.40B2, fund Code HP, DoD Base
   Closure and Realignment Account, Part IV (BRAC 95) funds closure and realignment costs
   associated with actions recommended by the 1995 Base closure Commission created under
   the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (Title 29 of P.L. 101-510). Funds
   appropriated in this account will be available for obligation until expended. The
   following are bases designated for closure and realignment.

         Bergstrom AFB TX                 McClellan AFB CA
         Eglin AFB FL                     O’Hare IAP, IL
         Grand forks AFB ND               Onizuka AS CA
         Griffiss AFB NY (Redirect)       Ontario IAP CA
         Hill AFB UT (UTTR)               REDCAP NY
         Homestead AFB FL (Redirect)      Reese AFB TX
         Kelly AFB TX                     Roslyn ANGS NY
         Lowry AFB CO (Redirect)          Malmstrom AFB MT


   23.1.6. REDIRECTS: In some cases, the subsequent Commission's recommendations
   change the base closure or realignment actions of a previous Commission. In most cases, this
   does not effect environmental restoration, property management, and disposal. Usually, you
   fund redirects with the BRAC appropriation associated with the Commission that directed the
   change. In the case of BRAC 91, there are three redirect actions for Mather, George, and
   Chanute AFBs which are authorized payment with BRAC 91 vice BRAC 88. Prior to 11 July
   97, pay for the redirect of Mather reserves to Beale AFB with BRAC 91 funds. After 10 Jul
   97, pay the costs of the BRAC 93 redirects (Castle AFB, Mather AFB, Chanute AFB,
   Rickenbacker ANGB, and Carswell AFB) with BRAC 93 funds. MacDill AFB was further
   redirected BRAC 95. If you are uncertain regarding appropriate funding, contact SAF/IEIT
   for guidance.
23.2. Structure of the Account. The structure of the base closure accounts is by base
"package" and by commodity (e.g., Military Construction, Operation and Maintenance, etc.).
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                           341


   23.2.1. The Air Force uses uniform program and project codes to identify these expenses for
   budget formulation and execution. In addition, SAF/FMB assigns a discrete budget activity
   account number (BAAN) to identify each closure or realignment package.
   23.2.2. See AFMAN 65-604 for the detailed coding structure of the programs, projects, and
   BAANs used for recommendations of all the Base Closure Commissions. The budget
   programs include:

        100 Military Construction
        200 Military Family Housing
        300 Operation and Maintenance
        400 Military Personnel
        500 Procurement Type Items
        600 Environmental Compliance
        700 Installation Restoration


Section 23B—Funds Administration and Budget Execution

23.3. Financial Responsibilities:
   23.3.1. SAF/FM prescribes financial management and comptroller actions necessary to close
   or realign force structure at the installations recommended for closure or realignment by the
   Base Closure Commission.
       23.3.1.1. SAF/FMB allocates BRAC funds to the MAJCOM/FOAs.
       23.3.1.2. SAF/FMB resolves financial management and funding issues with OSD, the
       other Services, affected MAJCOMs, FOAs, and components.
       23.3.1.3. SAF/FMB maintains a cost collection system to track relevant costs associated
       with pending base realignments or closures.
   23.3.2. Director for Budget and Finance, Washington Headquarters Services (WHS),
   provides departmental-level accounting and reporting for the DoD Base Closure Account.
   23.3.3. AJCOM/FMs sub-allocate BRAC funds to the affected installations.
   23.3.4. Installation/FMs administer BRAC funds.
   23.3.5. SAF/IEIT, as Program Managers, provides oversight of the Base Closure and
   Realignment Program Accounts. SAF/FMBIC provides financial expertise to SAF/IEIT to
   ensure fiduciary oversight and responsibilities.
23.4. Budget Process:
   23.4.1. MAJCOM XPs develop initial requirements for MILCON, Military Family Housing,
   Operation and Maintenance, and Procurement. The MAJCOM owning the closing or
   realigning base is responsible for compiling all closure or realignment costs. Specific
   guidance for requirement development is provided by SAF/IEIT.
 342                                                AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   23.4.2. MAJCOM CEVs develop initial requirements for Environmental Compliance and
   Restoration. MAJCOMs cost these requirements and coordinate with their MAJCOM/FMs.
   23.4.3. HQ AFPC develops Military Personnel PCS initial requirements and SAF/FMBOP
   provides costs. Submit requirements for approval through SAF/IEIT (oversight and
   integration) and the Base Closure Working Group (functional area validation) to the Base
   Closure Executive Group (BCEG).
23.5. Congressional Approval:
   23.5.1. The Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, Section 2904(b) (P.L. 101-510)
   stipulates that a base closure or realignment may not be carried out earlier than 45 legislative
   days after the date the President transmits his recommendations to the Congress, provided
   Congress does not disapprove those recommendations.
       23.5.1.1. While Congressional action is pending, the Air Force cannot carry out any
       closure or realignment included in those recommendations.
       23.5.1.2. Don't obligate BRAC 95 funds or Air Force funds to implement BRAC 95
       actions until the 45 legislative day period elapses.
23.6. Operating Under Continuing Resolution Authority. A CRA funds essential military
and civil functions before enactment of the Appropriations Act. In the past, this authority has not
included BRAC appropriations. Don't use CRA authority to record obligations against
anticipated and unsigned BRAC appropriations unless specifically advised by SAF/FMB to do
so.
23.7. Reprogramming:
   23.7.1. Funding documents contain administrative limitations on moving funds between
   programs and projects.
       23.7.1.1. Don't move funds between BAANs. An over-obligation of these limitations is
       an Anti-Deficiency Act violation.
       23.7.1.2. Don't authorize or incur obligations for more than the amount stated for each
       budget program or each line item (BAAN).
   23.7.2. Due to the dynamic nature of the BRAC business, requirements may change
   unexpectedly. MAJCOM/XPP (or equivalent) validates any increase to a project amount or
   additional requirements. MAJCOMs must request approval from SAF/IEIT, with an
   information copy to SAF/FMBIC, for reprogramming of funds within their approved
   program to meet increases or additional requirements. If:
       23.7.2.1. Reprogramming of funds within the total MAJCOM program cannot fulfill the
       requirement, then the MAJCOM may request reprogramming in the account from
       SAFMIIT with an information copy to SAF/FMBIC.
       23.7.2.2. SAF/IEIT disapproves a reprogramming request or if there aren't additional
       funds available within the total program, then HQ AF/RTT notifies the MAJCOM to
       submit a request for additional funds through the normal budget process.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             343


   23.7.3. Current DoD practice directs that BRAC 91 and BRAC 93 funds be treated as
   separate appropriations. Don't use any BRAC 91 funds for BRAC 93 requirements unless
   DoD submits a prior notification reprogramming request to Congress and Congress approves.
23.8. Tenant Requirements:
   23.8.1. The MAJCOM owning the closing or realigning base is responsible for compiling all
   closure or realignment costs, including costs of non-Air Force DoD agency tenants. Don't
   include costs for non-DoD Federal agencies or private sector firms or personnel, unless there
   is a specific contract termination cost generated by the closure or realignment.

Section 23C—Funding Guidance

23.9. Availability of Appropriations for BRAC Costs:
   23.9.1. Funding Direct Base Closure Costs under BRAC. The law authorizes the BRAC
   accounts to fund one-time, non-recurring costs that are a direct result of BRAC-directed
   base closure or realignment actions.
      23.9.1.1. Charge the BRAC account established to cover the base that is being closed or
      realigned (Round I, II, etc.).
      23.9.1.2. Fund redirects as directed in paragraph 23.1.6 Table 23.1 identifies typical
      costs financed by BRAC. It doesn't address all situations. Apply the guidance in this
      paragraph regarding direct, non-recurring costs in all cases. Section 23D contains
      additional guidance for special situations.
   23.9.2. Reimbursing Other Agencies. Under Section 2905 the Military Services may also
   reimburse other Federal agencies for actions performed at the request of the Secretary
   concerning implementing any such closure or realignment, and may use for such purpose
   funds in the Account or funds appropriated to the Department of the Air Force and available
   for such purpose. (NOTE: If you're uncertain regarding a request from another agency (non-
   AF), ask SAF/IEIT for guidance.)
   23.9.3. BRAC Funding Exclusions. Some costs don't qualify for BRAC funding as costs
   resulting from closure or realignment.
      23.9.3.1. Force structure drawdowns or realignments made outside the BRAC process,
      e.g., PCR actions.
      23.9.3.2. Civilian or military salaries, except where specially authorized.
      23.9.3.3. NAFI Personnel Costs (PCS and Severance Pay for NAFI Employees). Use
      only non-appropriated funds for personnel costs such as permanent change of station
      (PCS) or severance pay.
      23.9.3.4. Normal upkeep for base facilities through the closure date.
      23.9.3.5. CARE office manpower and normal operating expenses.
      23.9.3.6. Unit operating expenses such as telephone service, janitorial services, utilities,
      airfield operating costs through the closure date.
      23.9.3.7. Corrections of existing deficiencies.
 344                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       23.9.3.8. Rotational PCS moves, both military and civilian.
       23.9.3.9. Includes low cost, emergency evacuation, accession, training, unit, and
       separation PCS moves and funded with other than BRAC funds.
   23.9.4. Environmental Restoration. Since 1991 the BRAC accounts are the exclusive
   source of funds for environmental restoration.
       23.9.4.1. Don't use either Defense Environment Restoration Account (DERA) or O&M
       funds to make up an environmental restoration shortfall.
       23.9.4.2. AFMAN 65-604 lists the environmental compliance expenses projects eligible
       for BRAC funding. Direct technical environmental questions to AF/CEV.
23.10. Election Rule. The base closure laws created a unique situation, in making both the
BRAC account and AF appropriations that finance costs for O&M, planning and design, and
minor construction available for realignment and closure costs. However, once you have charged
a legal appropriation for a specific BRAC-related expense (e.g., a particular civilian PCS), you
cannot subsequently transfer that expense to another account.

Section 23D—Other Funding Guidance

23.11. Military PCS Costs:
   23.11.1. BRAC Military Permanent Change of Station (PCS). Decentralize BRAC
   targeted operational moves and funding limitations through the MAJCOM to the closing
   installation.
       23.11.1.1. Code these moves with a "T" (e.g., non transoceanic) travel cost identifier by
       Headquarters Air Force Military Personnel Center.
       23.11.1.2. Charge all PCS moves with other travel cost identifiers to the regular AF
       MILPERS PCS account (3500 appropriation). Base FMs must validate all BRAC PCS
       fund cites on "T" coded orders processed by the local Military Personnel Flights.
   23.11.2. The Travel Accounting Section determines an actual estimate of obligations for
   each traveler. Report the actual obligations in the accounting system during budget
   execution, rather than average officer and enlisted PCS composite rates for move and travel
   entitlements.
   23.11.3. Use the CMA PCS (3500) account for personnel who PCS from designated closure
   bases to an overseas station. If you use CMA funds, follow the normal procedures.
23.12. Civilian Personnel Costs. (This applies to host and tenant costs but excludes NAF
costs.)
   23.12.1. Health Benefits. The organization that pays for the individual's salary is
   responsible to pay for the continuation of health benefits. (Section 8905a(d), title 5 U.S.C)
   23.12.2. Retirement. BRAC will not fund retirement-related costs for civilian employees
   who elect to retire instead of relocating to another job. Fund only lump-sum leave balances
   from BRAC.
   23.12.3. Separation Pay and Reduction in Force (RIF). The appropriation and
   organization that pays for the individual's salary pays for separation or RIF costs. On a base
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            345


   closure or realignment base, the BRAC accounts are available for making Voluntary
   Separation Incentive Pay (VSIP) payments, as well as related Voluntary Early Retirement
   Authority (VERA) payments, provided that the payments are legitimate implementation costs
   associated with a base closure commission recommended closure or realignment. If the
   VERA or VSIP payment is not a legitimate implementation cost associated with a BRAC
   closure or realignment, the organization that pays the salary of the individual is responsible
   to fund the separation pay (P.L. 102-484, October 23, 1992, Section 5597
   23.12.4. Unemployment Compensation. Unemployment compensation is a base closure
   account cost. The Services pay up to 26 weeks, and do not pay for extended benefits.
   However, BRAC cannot fund unemployment costs related to downsizing or realignment
   actions outside BRAC.
   23.12.5. Severance Pay. This is funded from BRAC because it is considered a one-time
   cost.
23.13. Tenant Employees Costs. Follow the rules for other civilian employees.
   23.13.1. BRAC will fund employee relocation costs for Defense Commissary Service,
   Defense Reutilization Marketing Office, Defense Mapping Agency, sister Service, etc.,
   employees, if they are the last persons in their positions and another program doesn't fund
   them.
   23.13.2. Manpower must approve the designation of designated positions.
23.14. Training Costs For AFBCA Employees. Charge the BRAC accounts for on-going
training of Air Force Base Conversion Agency (AFBCA) civilian employees. Charge BRAC
accounts for training costs for HQ AFCEE BRAC employees.
23.15. MWR Packing, Crating, And Transportation of MWR Equipment. Appropriated
funds may pay for the transportation of MWR equipment and supplies (appropriated and
nonappropriated fund-owned) because of a base closure or realignment.
   23.15.1. Funding policy for shipment of MWR items is the same as that for appropriated
   support equipment.
   23.15.2. Use BRAC Account funds to transport MWR equipment and supplies.
   23.15.3. In all cases, the gaining base must have a validated requirement to use BRAC
   funds.
23.16. Congressional Approval for Construction. Notify the House and Senate Armed
Services Committees for any project funded from base closure that exceeds the ceiling on minor
construction ($750,000) and for any no longer required projects previously included in budget
submissions. Specific approvals are not required.
23.17. NAF Facilities Construction:
   23.17.1. Don't fund any new commissary construction from the base closure accounts
   (according to the DoD policy stated in the 1992 hearings before the House Appropriation
   Subcommittee). However, certain provisions within BRAC I and II permit using proceeds
   from the sale of NAF facilities and commissary real property to finance acquisition and
   expansion of such facilities at receiving bases. Until DoD provides new guidance, do not
   fund new commissary construction from Base Closure Accounts.
 346                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   23.17.2. Base closure account funds may fund construction and renovation of Category A,
   B, & C NAF facilities and commissaries at receiving installations. However,
       23.17.2.1. Be careful to ensure that these projects do not exceed the needs created by
       closure or realignment.
       23.17.2.2. Don't use BCA funds for "get well" projects unrelated to closure or
       realignment.
       23.17.2.3. Notify Congress for all projects over $750,000.
   23.17.3. Normally appropriated funds are not available for construction or expansion of
   category B or C NAFIs.
       23.17.3.1. Section 23C lists exceptions to the funding policies (e.g., when the transfer of
       new units or functions require construction or expansion at an installation).
       23.17.3.2. Commands should coordinate any proposal to use appropriated funds for
       construction or expansion of category B or C NAFI at receiving installations with
       SAF/FMBIC and SAF/ FMPB.

executive or operating programs.
Computers: Applications Software (functional)—Applications software are those routines and
programs designed by or for IPE users to accomplish specific, mission-oriented tasks, jobs, or
functions using the IPE and basic software available. Applications software may be either
general/common purpose packages, such as demand-deposit accounting, payroll, machine tool
control, etc.; or specific application programs tailored to accomplish a single or a limited number
of user functions, such as base level personnel, depot maintenance, missile or satellite tracking,
etc. Except for packages acquired directly from software vendors or from the OEM, the user
generally develops this type of software with in-house resources or through contract services.
Computers: Software Maintenance—Efforts associated with eliminating faults in software to
ensure that an information system (IS) or application is in a satisfactory working condition.
Computers: Software Changes—Efforts associated with revision or alteration of an existing IS

management (for example, aircraft, missiles, support equipment, trainers, etc.).
Continuing Resolution Authority (CRA)—Budget authority resulting from legislation
introduced as a joint resolution and enacted by the Congress to provide authority for federal
agencies to continue operations until a specified date or until the regular appropriations are
enacted. The Continuing Resolution usually specifies a maximum rate at which obligations may
be incurred based on the rate of the prior year, the President's budget request, or an appropriation
bill passed by either or both Houses of the Congress. Obligations under Continuing Resolution
Authority are usually controlled by apportionment. There is no “standard” CRA language.
Each CRA enacted must be carefully read for the specific provisions pertaining to the
particular fiscal year being addressed.
Contract Change—A change to a contract which requires the contractor to perform additional
work. Contract changes do not include adjustments to pay claims, increases under escalation
costs or corrections for administrative or accounting errors.

inventories. It includes commercial or off-the-shelf aircraft, missiles and equipment; research
and development (R&D) prototypes converted to operational use etc., when organic life cycle
logistics support is not planned for various reasons (for example, is not cost effective). Under
CLS, the user obtains spares and repair parts off-the-shelf; the spares are not normally
provisioned and stock listed by the Air Force. Under CLS, it is common for the contractor to
provide all elements of support (that is, support equipment, data, spares, and personnel). CLS
differs from ICS in that it is a permanent rather than temporary method of contractor support.

endanger life and property or disrupt the usual process of government. The term domestic
emergency includes any or all of the emergency conditions defined below:
Civil Defense Emergency— A domestic emergency situation resulting from devastation created
by an enemy attack and requiring emergency operations during and following that attack. It may
be proclaimed by appropriate authority in anticipation of an attack.
Civil Disturbances— Riots, acts of violence, insurrections, unlawful obstructions or
assemblages, or other disorders prejudicial to public law and order. The term civil disturbance
includes all domestic conditions requiring or likely to require the use of Federal Armed Forces
pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 15 of Title 10, United States Code.
Major disaster—Any flood, fire, hurricane, tornado, earthquake, or other catastrophe which, in
the determination of the President, is or threatens to be of sufficient severity and magnitude to
warrant disaster assistance by the Federal Government under Public Law 606, 91st Congress (42
United States Code 58) to supplement the efforts and available resources of state and local
governments in alleviating the damage, hardship, or suffering caused thereby.
Natural Disaster—All domestic emergencies except those created as a result of enemy attack or
civil disturbance.

When used in connection with multiyear procurement EOQs, the procurement of materiel for
future-year production quantities of items that is not required by procurement leadtimes but is
desirable for economic reasons.
Economy Act Orders (31 U.S.C. 1535)—DoD activities may place requests (orders) for
materials, work, or services with another DoD component or another federal government agency
under the Economy Act. 31 U.S.C. 1535 requires that obligations recorded against such orders on
the books of the ordering agency be reduced at the end of the period for which the appropriation
is authorized for obligation, to the extent that the agency ordered upon has not incurred
obligations under that order (see DFAS-DE 7000.4-R). This statutory restriction applies only to
Economy Act orders. Since MIPRs are issued under the Economy Act, the deobligation
requirement applies.
Engineering Change—An alteration in the configuration of a CI (including software) after
formal establishment of its operational configuration baseline.
Expired appropriation—An appropriation which is no longer available for new obligations but
has not been canceled. P. L. 101-510 extended the expired period from 2 to 5 years. During the

integrity, and symbol) and is available for adjusting and liquidating obligations, including
within-scope contract changes.
Full Funding—Funds are planned, programmed and budgeted for the total estimated cost to
deliver and install a complete end item. At the time of contract award, funds are available to
cover the total estimated cost to deliver the contract quantity of complete, militarily usable items.
The funds in each fiscal year appropriation request must buy complete, military usable end items.
The contract is not fully funded if a future-year appropriation is required for delivery of some
components of the end item. (NOTE: Installation funding for procurement appropriation
modifications can be budgeted in the year the installation is to be accomplished.)
Funding Distribution—The process of issuing and limiting authority to incur obligations and
make expenditures. An administrative action, usually within the chain of command,
accomplished within appropriations made by Congress and apportionment limitations established
by OMB (for example, allocation and allotment).
HOST-TENANT-Host—A unit or activity that has management control of facilities, and
provides services or facilities to another unit or activity (tenant). Within the Air Force, the Air
Force MAJCOM that has jurisdiction over the installation and other real property (including use
rights such as leases, permits, easements, and licenses). Also, the host may be the organization
which has been designated by the MAJCOM, or by HQ USAF as a supplier (reference AFI 25-
201), to furnish tenant support.
Gross Additional Costs—Costs incurred due to the presence of the tenant which are in excess
of costs of accomplishing the mission of the host.
Incremental Direct Cost—The cost of resources directly consumed to perform an individual
activity that would not have been consumed if the individual activity were not performed. A cost
that is specifically identified with a single cost object.
Joint Use—Concurrent use of host facilities and equipment by both host and tenant, as required
by the mission of each user.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              371

Interim Contractor Support (ICS)—This is a cost-effective logistics support alternative for a
system or high cost modification. It allows the Air Force to defer investment in all or part of the
support resources such as spares, technical data, support equipment, and training equipment.
Contractor support is used while Air Force capability is being phased in. ICS provides services,
for the specified period of time requested in the President’s Budget, after the first production
system or equipment, or modified item, is delivered to the using command but before its major
commitment in the War and Mobilization Plan (WMP). However, ICS may provide depot
support for a longer period if such an extension is necessary and validated through review,
analysis, and experience and justified in the President’s Budget.

year is budgeted and funded annually. At the time of award, funds need only to have been
appropriated for the first year.
Multiyear Procurement—A generic term describing the process, planning, and contract under
which the government will commit to procurement of the current year procurement quantity of
items and future quantities as reflected in the FYDP. It does not apply to advance procurement of
long leadtime items.

adjustments), foreign currency fluctuation charges, and others
Operational Configuration Baseline—That configuration baseline which is defined or
specified at the start of full-scale development (in terms of performance, reliability,
supportability, etc.), and against which the test items or prototype is tested and qualified. Once
the developed items or kit has been tested and accepted for production, the baseline is normally
"frozen" until completion of the modification program.
Orders for Procurement by Another DoD Component (10 U.S.C. 2308, 2309)—DoD

Project Orders (41 U.S.C. 23)—Project orders (AF Form 185) are requests for the manufacture
of materials, supplies, and equipment or other work or services placed with and accepted by a
Government-owned and operated establishment that meets the criteria in DoD 7000.14-R, Vol.
11A, Chapter 2. As stated in DoD 7000.14-R, if the project order form is not available, the
ordering activities may use the Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) form
(DD Form 448) as a project order form provided it contains the following specific statement:
"This order is placed in accordance with the provisions of 41 U.S.C. 23 and DoD Directive
7220.1." Comptroller General (CompGen) Decision B-246773 restricts the use of project orders
to transactions within the Department of Defense. Transactions between DoD components and
other government agencies outside of DoD are governed by the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535).
Recurring Costs—Production costs that vary with the quantity being produced, such as labor
and materials.
 374                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


Reimbursement:-Anticipated Reimbursement—The dollar amount of reimbursement
estimated to be realized during the life of the appropriation. On Command reimbursement
reports, anticipated reimbursements received apply to each fiscal or program year.
Centrally Administered Reimbursement Program—Reimbursable customer orders
administered by an Air Force designated command or operating agency for which goods or
services are provided (all or in part) by other commands or operating agencies. Under this
program, the designated command or operating agency centrally records and collects accounts
receivable for the goods or services provided by other commands or operating agencies. The
appropriation manager issues the reimbursable obligation authority for centrally administered
reimbursable customer orders to the command or operating activity that administers the
reimbursable program. The appropriation manager issues an offsetting amount of direct
obligation authority to the commands that provide the goods or services to enable them to
finance the cost of the goods or services.
Centrally Collected Reimbursements—Reimbursement transactions collected centrally by a
designated operating agency although the reimbursable order is received or earned at some other
place.
Collected Reimbursements—Amounts received and recorded on a cumulative basis as payment
for goods delivered or services furnished. This includes progress payments made to contractors
for FMS operations that will be billed to DFAS-DE/1 as a basis for accounts receivable.
Earned or Filled Reimbursements—The amount of reimbursable goods delivered or services
furnished (billed or unbilled, collected or uncollected), including progress payments made to
contractors for FMS operations which are billed to DFAS-DE/I (DFAS-Denver, Directorate of
Security Assistance) as a basis for accounts receivable.
Intraappropriation or Intrafund Reimbursement—A reimbursable transaction where the
buying and the selling appropriation are identical as to symbol and fiscal year, but the Operating
Agency Code (OAC) may be different or the same. SAF/FMBM must specifically authorize the
treatment of such transactions as reimbursements.
Reimbursable Obligation—An obligation incurred solely to support a reimbursable program.
Reimbursable Program—Requirements levied on Air Force agencies for which reimbursement
will be received based on reported delivery.
Reimbursements Realized—Firm authorized agreements or orders received and accepted that

Reimbursement Schedules—Schedules that identify the anticipated customer orders to be
received, by accounts receivable sales code. These schedules show the anticipated
reimbursements included in the funds provided in budget authorizations.
Replacement—Sale of an item that requires replacement to compensate DoD inventories for the
resultant loss of capability or readiness. However, because of a number of circumstances, the
replacement item may not be identical to the item sold. It must, however, be a later series or
"mod" designation of the same basic model or an acceptable substitute item used against the
same inventory objective or authorized acquisition objective in requirements computations. In
this situation, the reimbursement from the sale will be included under reimbursable financing,
but the buy-back of the replacement item must be shown under the direct budget plan.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              375


Replacement-in-Kind—Sale of an item of materiel that requires replacement with an item of
the identical type, model, and series or "mod" designation. In this situation, the reimbursement
from the sale must be included in reimbursable financing at the time of buyback of the item. This
transaction will not show in the direct budget plan.
Reproducible Copy—A copy, negative, paper master or any other media, such as sound track
and film from which technical data are reproduced as printed film or sound track.
Reprogramming—Utilization of funds in an appropriation account for purposes other than
those contemplated at the time of appropriation. Above threshold reprogrammings and those
reprogrammings which involve general transfer authority require consolidation (Omnibus
Reprogramming Request) and approval of the appropriate Congressional Committees. The
Omnibus Reprogramming Request is normally submitted to OSD in the May-June timeframe.
Rescission—The consequence of enacted legislation which cancels budgetary resources
previously provided by the Congress prior to the time when the authority would otherwise lapse.
Section 1012 of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 requires a special message from the
President to the Congress reporting any proposed rescission of budgetary resources. These
proposals may be accepted in whole or in part through the passage of a rescission bill by both
Houses of the Congress.
Sales from Inventory—Items furnished from existing Air Force inventory for which
reimbursement from the customer is received and concurrent replacement to the inventory is not
required. For FMS, these proceeds are treated as free assets with deposit to miscellaneous
receipts account.
Servicing—The act or occupation of performing work or meeting a general demand.
Common-servicing—That function performed by one Military Service in support of another
Military Service for which reimbursement is not required from the Service receiving support.
Cross-servicing—That function performed by one Military Service in support of another
Military Service for which reimbursement is required from the Service receiving support:

services rendered by, an activity of the procuring or performing department, whether the activity
is financed by appropriations, working capital funds, or otherwise. Accomplish project orders
issued to a DoD agency only on a reimbursable basis. (Do not issue project orders to any activity
that is responsible for furnishing the required materiel or services without reimbursement.)
All requests, requisitions, or orders for supplies, and equipment to be obtained under coordinated
procurement by consolidated contracts or project orders issued by the procuring or performing
activity on government-owned establishments.
Category two (direct cite)—includes all requests, requisitions or orders for supplies, equipment,
or services for accomplishment by separate contracts in behalf of the ordering agency, or by
combined contracts with separate delivery schedules by contract item for each ordering agency,

Space Shuttle. Also included are Shuttle user charges (orbiter flight charges), which are specified
by interagency agreement between DoD and NASA.
Supplemental Appropriation—An act appropriating funds in addition to those in an annual
appropriation act. Supplemental appropriations provide additional budget authority beyond
original estimates for programs or activities (including new programs authorized after the date of
the original appropriation act) for which the need for funds is too urgent to be postponed until
enactment of the next regular appropriation act.
Support—Facilities, materiel, or services provided by the host to a tenant.
Interservice Support—Performed by a component organization by one Military Service or
element thereof to provide logistic and/or administrative support to another Military Service or

drawings, master layout (MLO) drawing, undimensioned drawings, specifications, parts list,
automatic equipment program master tapes or cards, microfilm, printed copies, commercial
manuals, film, sound tracks, or any other media used primarily for conveying technical
information. The term technical data also applies to the reproducible copy from which multiple
copies of technical data are reproduced.
Follow-on Technical Data Requirements—Requirements that occur after completing the
acquisition phase, such as preparing automatic equipment program master tapes, cards, film, and
sound tracks for out-of-production (in-service) equipment, and using Air Force-owned
reproducible copy or reproducible master tapes for printing reproducing additional technical data
for stock replenishment.
Initial Technical Data—The data in the form of multiple copies, film, sound tracks, and
reproducible copy procured with the end item, equipment, or component thereof; revisions of

sound form), index type TOs, and abbreviated TOs.
Telephone—Commercial "Unofficial" Telephone Service. This means telephone service where
the subscriber receives network access and service directly from the telephone company.
Termination—A procedure that may apply to any government contract, including multiyear
contracts. Unlike cancellation, which is commonly effected between fiscal years and must apply
to all subsequent fiscal years' quantities of items, termination may be effected at any time during
the life of a contract and may apply to the total quantity or to a partial quantity of items.
Termination Liability—The maximum cost the government would incur if a contract were
terminated.
Termination Liability Funding—A budgeting technique that would provide funds on a contract
to cover the maximum value of outlays that could be incurred for work accomplished by the end
of the budget year plus the maximum cost to the government associated with termination of the
contract at the end of the budget year.
Testing—The following terms are frequently used when discussing the financial aspects of
T&E. A more detailed understanding of these terms and discussion of other T&E terms and
applications can be found in AFI 99-101 and AFR 55-43.
Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E)—Process used to measure progress, verify
accomplishment of development objectives; and to determine if theories, techniques, and
materiel are practical and if systems or items under development are technically sound, reliable,
safe, and satisfy specifications.
Implementing Command—The command (usually AFMC) responsible for the acquisition or
modification of the system, subsystem, or item of equipment and for managing DT&E, DT&E
qualification tests, qualification test and evaluation (QT&E), and production acceptance test and
evaluation (PAT&E).
Net-Additive Costs—Used in reference to operational test and evaluation (OT&E), T&E costs
specifically incurred to support a test that cannot be satisfied in conjunction with training or
other programmed testing. These are support costs (including pretest planning and test
preparation activities) that would not be incurred if OT&E were not conducted. Examples of
these costs are provided in Figure 14.1.
Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E)—Testing and evaluation (divided into initial
operational test and evaluation and follow-on operational test and evaluation, and generally
associated with the first major production decision) conducted in as realistic an operational
environment as possible to estimate prospective system's military utility, operational
effectiveness, and operational suitability. In addition, operational test and evaluation provides
information on organization, personnel requirements, doctrine, and tactics. Also, it may provide
 378                                               AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


data to support the verification of material in operating instructions, publications, and
handbooks. There are three subcategories of OT&E:
Initial OT&E (IOT&E)—The first phase of operational test and evaluation conducted on
preproduction items, prototypes, or pilot production items, and normally completed before the
first major production decision. It is conducted to provide a valid estimate of a system's
operational effectiveness and operational suitability before the first major production decision.
Follow-on OT&E (FOT&E)—The second phase of operational test and evaluation conducted
on production items in an operational environment. It is conducted to verify operational
effectiveness and operational suitability; and to provide information on organization, personnel
requirements, doctrine, and tactics; and assess whether production techniques have affected
system performance or operational suitability as determined during initial operational test and
evaluation.
Force Development Evaluation (FDE)—FDE is focused on the MAJCOM’s requirement for
the operational employment and sustainment of systems after the initial acquisition process. It is
the evaluation, demonstration, exercise, or analyses of fielded, operational systems throughout
the system life cycle. MAJCOM system operators use the material and force development
processes to ensure their systems continue meeting operational need by examining doctrine,
operational concepts, system performance, procedures, tactics, training, organization, personnel,
the logistics element, and material issues, among other things (AFI 99-102). (Development
engineering, prototypes, testing of prototypes and resulting procurements are not accomplished
under FDE). In addition, FDE :
   a. Helps refine employment doctrines and tactics in response to changing threats.
   b. Helps develop or refine operational procedures and training programs.
   c. Evaluates changes and verifies correction of new deficiencies discovered after
      system deployment.
   d. Explores non-material means of satisfying changing operational requirements
      during system sustainment.
   e. Evaluates routine software block cycle changes (operational flight programs
      (OFP), preplanned product improvements (P3I), modifications, upgrades, mission
      data updates, and other improvements or changes during sustainment.
   f. Evaluates operational system against Foreign Materiel Equipment (FME) and new
      threat systems.
   g. Addresses questions and needs of operational users employing the same high
      standards of analysis and evaluation as are used by AFOTEC for IOT&E and
      FOT&E.
   h. May be conducted concurrently with FOT&E.
   i. The study and analysis of a system are funded with O&M. However, any resulting
      development engineering, prototypes, and prototype testing are funded with
      RDT&E. Procurement solutions are generally funded in the investment accounts.
Qualification OT&E (QOT&E)—There are programs for which OT&E must be performed
even though there has not been a foregoing development effort. This testing is conducted after or
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                 379


in combination with QT&E, may involve single end items or multiple procurements, and could
lead to a major procurement or production decision. QOT&E is conducted in lieu of IOT&E on
programs for which there has been no R&D effort, and on certain modifications to existing
systems.
Operational Test and Evaluation Command (OTEC)—Usually Air Force Operational Test
and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC), but sometimes the major command (MAJCOM) or Field
operating agency (FOA) responsible for managing and conducting the OT&E.
Pretest Planning Activities—These involve OT&E organizations in test plan working group
(TPWG) meetings, development of the test plan, and coordination of support requirements
outlined in that test plan.
Test Preparation Activities—These take place before the start date. They include activities
such as modifying or shipping equipment needed for the test, training personnel who will operate
and maintain the system during testing, site preparation, procuring supplies and support items for
conducting the test, and establishing the test team at the test site. These activities also take place
before the test start date, but are not classified as pretest planning activities.
Test Program Set (TPS)—TPS is the interface equipment which allows automatic test
equipment(ATE) to diagnose the condition or performance level of equipment or systems. TPS is
considered an integral part of the end item.
Production Acceptance Test and Evaluation (PAT&E)—T&E of production items to
demonstrate that items procured fulfill the requirements and specifications of the procuring
contracts or agreements.
Qualification Test and Evaluation (QT&E)—QT&E is conducted in lieu of DT&E, which
may involve contractor and government testing, on programs for which no R&D effort is
required (commercially developed items, off-the-shelf equipment items, etc.) and on certain
modifications to existing systems.
Qualification Tests— Tests that verify the design and manufacturing process and thus provide a
baseline for subsequent acceptance tests (they include both preproduction qualification tests and
production qualification and acceptance tests).
Test Funds—Funds specifically allocated for test preparation and conduct and issued to the
agency responsible for conducting the test. For DT&E, test funds would be those funds issued to
the Systems Program Office (SPO). For IOT&E, test funds would be those funds issued to the
OTEC (AFOTEC, MAJCOM, or FOA) conducting the test.
Test Resource Plan (TRP)—The TRP is a resource management document used throughout the
OT&E planning process to identify and coordinate resources required to support testing. TRPs
are prepared and submitted by AFOTEC for all Air Force-directed OT&E. This includes
AFOTEC-conducted, QOT&E, and IOT&E; and HQ USAF-directed, AFOTEC-conducted
FOT&E. The TRP must be coordinated with the program office and all other agencies tasked to
support the test. The TRP is a source of programming information and assures resources in the
plan are properly identified for programming and budgeting by those agencies tasked for support.
Special Support Costs—This term is used in the context of test and evaluation programs. It
refers to those acquisition or hardware costs, other than those associated with the item(s) which
 380                                                 AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


is (are) the subject of the test, which are incurred in direct support of the T&E effort. A good
example would be special range instrumentation costs.
Command Support Costs—This term also is used in the context of the T&E programs. It refers
to the "people-related" costs of the command and operational units provided collateral support to
the T&E effort. These are additional costs incurred because of this test support. Examples are per
diem pay, travel allowances, overtime, etc.
Transfer Authority—Authority provided by the Congress to transfer budget authority from one
appropriation or fund account to another.
Transportation:-First Destination Transportation (FDT)—Transportation required to effect
the delivery of materiel from a procurement source (including DoD industrial activities that
fabricate new material, but not if the industrial activity only reworks the item or component)
outside the DoD supply system to the first point at which the Air Force takes possession or
ownership. In those cases where the Air Force accepts a production item at the manufacturer's
plant, or source of production, and legally owns the item, FDT extends to the first point of
delivery for either use or storage. It includes the charges for freight, cartage, and demurrage
incurred incident to shipment of the materiel. Amplifications of this definition are as follows if
materiel is:
Procured within the CONUS, or overseas, for delivery to a CONUS or overseas point of use or
storage, FDT includes all transportation by land, air, and inland or coastal waterways, except
that FDT terminates at the port of embarkation (CONUS or overseas), when the item enters the
Defense Transportation System.
Incident to a HQ USAF-approved package program (such as Distant Early Warning (DEW)
line, or Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS)) and provided to the contractor by
the Air Force for use or storage at an overseas location, FDT includes all transportation from
point of origin of shipment to the point of use or storage, unless otherwise provided under the
terms of the "package program".
Materiel procured for, or on behalf of, a coproduction agreement for delivery to an overseas
point of use or storage, FDT includes all transportation from point of origin of shipment (that is,
contractor or government storage) to the overseas point of use or storage. Direct Air Force
funds pay the Air Force share of transportation; the coproduction partners' share must be funded
by reimbursable first destination funds.
Second Destination Transportation—Any transportation other than first destination. It includes
port handling charges and charges for freight, cartage, demurrage (also see paragraph 10.39),
and other charges incurred overseas incident to shipment of Air Force property.
Value Engineering—An organized effort directed at analyzing the function of Department of
Defense systems, equipment, facilities, procedures and supplies for the purpose of achieving the
required function at the lowest total cost of effective ownership, consistent with requirements for
performance, reliability, quality, and maintainability. (AFI 63-801, DoDD 4245.8 and FAR,
chapter 1, subchapter G, part 48, contain guidance for developing VE programs.)
Value Engineering Change Proposal (VECP)—A specific cost reduction proposal, developed
and submitted under VE contract provisions by a contractor, that requires a change to the
contract specifications, purchase description, or statement of work.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             381


Value Engineering Incentive Clause—Used in procurement and construction contracts to
motivate contractors to submit proposals for changes in drawings, designs, specifications, or
other contractual requirements for the purpose of stimulating cost reduction and provide for
compensation to contractors if such proposals are accepted.
Value Engineering Program Requirements Clause—A clause used primarily in design and
development contracts and to some extent in production contracts to require the contractor to
perform VE work at a stated level of effort during the course of performance of the contract and
to provide compensation for performance of such work and to share in resultant savings. The
contract will identify this requirement as a separate line item.
Value Engineering Proposal (VEP)—A specific proposal by Air Force personnel for economic
improvement through the use of VE techniques. The term can also be applied to contractor-
generated proposals that do not require a contract change to be implemented.
Warrant—The official document issued pursuant to law by the Secretary of the Treasury that
establishes the amount of money authorized to be withdrawn from the Treasury.
Weapon System Engineering—Weapon system engineering is the application of scientific and
engineering principles required to transform military requirements into operationally suitable
hardware and software products. Weapon system engineering includes the definition,
optimization, design, integration, interface control, test, verification, production, delivery and
support of the product throughout its life cycle (see Air Force Supplement 1 to DoD Instruction
5000.2).

                                          Attachment 2
    STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE FOR RESOURCE
                            MANAGERS

A2.1. Attachment 2 provides Air Force financial management guidance to resource managers.
This guidance applies to resource managers at all levels and provides the broad guidelines for
managers to carry out their mission responsibilities. Provide a copy of this statement to
commanders at all levels down to and including detachment commanders.
A2.2. Each Air Force commander and manager is responsible for the effective, efficient, and
economical use of all resources made available to his or her organization. The extent to which
each commander and manager directly influences the budgeting, allocation, composition, and
distribution of these resources depends on the degree of centralization of authority. The degree of
centralization is the prerogative of each echelon of command and is determined by the mission
needs, the resources involved, and managerial environment. Regardless of the level of
centralization, operating level managers are directly involved and responsible for managing the
resources used.
A2.3. Some resources may appear to be a cost-free asset in the view of the lower level manager,
because this manager may not either control the determination or allocation of these resources
(real property, weapon systems, and manpower) or may not have the authority to change the mix
of the total resources allocated. In these instances, the manager's principal responsibility is to
insure that these resources are used in the most cost effective manner. Managers need to be
aware of the composition of the total resources of the base, responsibility center or cost center.
All resources at operating locations are either directly controllable or there use is directly
influenced by managers.
A2.4. There are positive means for a manager to directly influence the effectiveness, efficiency,
and economy with which all resources are used to perform assigned missions and operations.
The individual manager assists in budget formulation and resource allocation by recommending
the best mix of resources to secure the most efficient use of available resources. Each manager
should take an active part in the formulation and execution of operating budgets. Participatory
management includes the use of resource advisors in each responsibility center and a financial
management and working committee structure to advise and assist the commander in the
decision-making process. The comptroller assists the manager by assuring fiduciary accounting
and control of obligations and providing expense data through the accounting system. Both
obligation and expense data are important because each involves distinct but related aspects of
financial management. Managers must have obligation data to monitor availability of funds.
Expense data is important because this is the basis for measuring performance of the
organization. Relating expenses to production for a given period tells a manager how well the
manager has done compared to a standard or to past activity. In most instances, expenses are the
same as obligations during execution of the operating budget as relates to the use of resources.
The comptroller also provides training in resource management and in the use of expense data in
financial management.
A2.5. The operation and maintenance (O&M) type appropriations finance most of the day-to-
day cost of running an Air Force base. There are a variety of factors that influence the degree to
which managers decide how these funds will be applied. The flying hour program, civilian
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              383


personnel authorizations, facility project approval, command directed TDY, and other
nonfinancial constraints determine to a large extent how a base uses its O&M dollars. Among all
the funds the Air Force receives, these O&M appropriations offer the highest degree of control to
managers.
A2.6. Civilian personnel costs can be influenced because requests for authorizations are initiated
by managers. The manager has the prerogative to recommend a future trade of this resource for
other resources. Civilian grade structure and overtime are controllable at base level.
A2.7. Managers either control or significantly influence utilities, transportation,
communications, contractual services, supplies, and equipment funds. Significant management
flexibility exists in these areas. Aviation Petroleum, Oil and Lubricant (POL) costs are tied
directly to flying hours. Managers can influence these costs by efficient scheduling of
proficiency, operational, and training flights.
A2.8. Managers have direct control over a portion of TDY funds; basically the control is
exercised over administrative TDY and mode of travel, depending on the base mission.
Command directed TDY may use some of these funds; however, managers can be selective as to
the number of travelers and the mode of transportation.
A2.9. Military personnel selection, assignment and funds are centrally controlled as a basic
policy of Air Force operations. The costs of military personnel are properly expensed as part of
the financial data provided to managers at all levels. Military personnel are a key resource of the
manager. The manager`s effectiveness in controlling on the job training (OJT), career
management, motivation, and personnel productivity are the key factors to the productivity of the
total system. It is essential that the manager knows the costs of military personnel resources that
go into mission performance. By maintaining surveillance over the total military personnel
program, the manager can influence the costs for military personnel through effective use of
personnel complementing the central assignment and funding policies.
A2.10. The advent of the Defense Working Capital Fund (formerly DBOF) in FY 1992
represents a significant change in the way we program, budget and execute support dollars
within the Department of Defense. The DWCF concept expands the use of revolving funds in the
DoD to cover many functions previously funded with direct appropriations, and then charges the
cost of these functions to the primary mission component that benefits from them. The method
develops a provider/consumer relationship for support elements where the customer has much
more control over the source of supply and can weigh alternatives on the bases of cost efficiency
and product effectiveness.
   A2.10.1. The concept has a two-fold focus. First, the DWCF identifies more of the support
   costs directly to the weapon systems that are supported, giving a more complete picture of
   the true costs of systems' support. Second, the concept fosters a more entrepreneurial spirit in
   the operation of DWCF "business areas," with more focus on cost control benefiting the
   customers through lower rates.
   A2.10.2. The method of distributing financial authority and fixing responsibility in the
   DWCF environment is through the principle of unit cost resourcing. As a typical example, a
   DWCF business area is provided a budget document that permits that activity to incur costs
   as a percentage of sales revenue. There is no obligation authority or operating budget
   authority as in the appropriated fund environment. This method allows each business activity
 384                                              AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   to respond to the demands of its customers and promotes a more cost oriented focus across
   the support spectrum. In addition, there are other support elements which are not part of the
   DWCF but which are funded on the basis of both an obligation authority and a unit cost goal.
   Examples of this type of fee-for-service activity are the training establishment and data
   processing support.
A2.11. An integral part of the entire resource management process is performance evaluation
and productivity measurement by the manager. Individual managers and commanders must have
tools, techniques, and analytical support required to interpret the data available and make
judgments as to performance. The comptroller assists both in this phase of resource management.
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                            385

                   ADVISORY AND ASSISTANCE SERVICES (A&AS)

A3.1. Public Law 102-394, as implemented in OMB Circular A-11, requires that obligations for
consulting service for the prior year through the budget year be submitted annually to the
Congress as a separate object Class (Object Class 25.1). The purpose of the exhibit is to provide
Congress with actual estimates on the amount spent by DoD on consulting services which are
utilized to enhance, assist, or improve the ability of government employees to make decisions on
governmental processes, programs, and systems.
A3.2. All commands and FOAs must submit annual budget exhibits identifying amounts
budgeted and obligated for three categories of services: Management and Professional Support
Services; Studies, Analyses, and Evaluations; and Engineering and Technical Services. Special
instructions for preparing the exhibit and for submission dates to SAF/FMB are in DoD
Regulation 7000.14R, volume 2, chapter 19 (see paragraph A3.4), and in guidance issued
annually by SAF/FMB.
A3.3. Reporting requirements for A&AS are exempt from licensing according to volume 2 of
the DoD Financial Management Regulation (DoD 7000.14-R) and paragraph E.4.f., of DoD
7750.5-M, Procedures for Management of Information Requirements.

                             DEFERRALS AND RESCISSIONS

A4.1. DoD Comptroller Guidance on Deferrals and Rescission (from DoD 7000.14-R, DoD
Financial Management Regulation, Vol. 3, Chapter 2, Paragraph 0207, December 1996). See
paragraph A4.2 through A4.4.
A4.2. Deferrals:
   A4.2.1. "1. Available budgetary resources may be withheld from obligation temporarily
   through the apportionment process with the intent of apportioning them for use later, before
   they lapse. Such deferral action may be taken by OMB on its own initiative or at the request
   of agencies. Budgetary resources may be deferred as reserves to provide for contingencies
   under provisions of the Anti-deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1512, formerly 31 U.S.C. 665); or
   they may be deferred for other reasons under the Impoundment Control Act (2 U.S.C. 681
   through 688, formerly 31 U.S.C. 1403), except that funds available for only one fiscal year
   may not be deferred throughout the year."
   A4.2.2. "2. All funds deferred through the apportionment process must be reported to the
   Congress in special messages. The Congress may overturn a deferral at any time by passing a
   law disapproving the deferral. If the Congress takes no action to disapprove reported
   deferrals, those deferrals may remain in effect until the end of the fiscal year unless a special
   message indicates that an earlier release is planned. For annual accounts and the last year of
   multiple-year accounts, however, funds may be deferred only for part of the year."
   A4.2.3. "3. As the fourth quarter approaches, Components should review all deferrals
   (particularly of funds expiring at the end of the year) to ensure that amounts deferred for only
   part of the year will be released in time to be used prudently before the year ends. If a
   determination is made that such amounts should not be used, a rescission will be proposed
   prior to the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter. Only in exceptional cases will rescissions
   be proposed during the fourth quarter. All proposed rescissions must be approved by OMB."
   A4.2.4. "4. If amounts actually becoming available are less than anticipated for indefinite
   budget authority, transfers, reimbursements, or recoveries, the difference will be deducted
   from amounts apportioned and not from amounts deferred or otherwise unapportioned, unless
   specific provision is made for a different treatment on the approved apportionment form or
   reapportionment action is taken. Whenever it is determined that a deferred amount will not
   be required to carry out the purposes of the appropriation or other authority, it will be
   recommended for rescission as required by law (31 U.S.C. 1512 and 2 U.S.C. 683)."
A4.3. Rescissions:
   A4.3.1. "1. The Impoundment Control Act specifies that, whenever the President determines
   that all or part of any budget authority will be required to carry out the full objectives or
   scope of programs for which it is provided, the President will propose to Congress that the
   funds be rescinded. Likewise, if all or part of any budget authority limited to a fiscal year
   (e.g., annual appropriations or budget authority for the last year of multiple-year accounts) is
   to be reserved for the entire fiscal year, a rescission will be proposed. Budget authority may
   also be proposed for rescission for fiscal policy or other reasons. Generally, amounts
   proposed for rescission will be withheld during the time the proposals are being considered
AFI65-601V1_341MWSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             387


   by the Congress. This may be accomplished through OMB apportionment action or through
   agency withholding action."
   A4.3.2. "2. All funds proposed for rescission, including those withheld, must be reported to
   Congress in special messages. Positive action in the form of an enacted law must be
   completed to rescind funds. If both Houses of Congress have not completed action on a
   rescission proposed by the President within 45 calendar days of continuous session, any
   funds being withheld must be made available for obligation."
A4.4. DoD Comptroller Guidance on Deferrals:
   A4.4.1. "1. OMB Circular A-34 recognizes the possibility of agency deferrals that are not
   identified in connection with the apportionment process. These are categorized as deferrals of
   funds provided for a specific purpose or project when such deferral would result in obligation
   for such specific purpose of project at a pace significantly slower than intended by the
   Congress. Since it is the policy of the Secretary of Defense to obligate programs consistent
   with the expressed intent of the Congress, this category of action should not take place within
   the Department. Strict adherence to this policy, however, does not preclude the continuance
   of prudent administrative actions reflected on financial authorizations that affect the timing
   of obligations for reasons related to the routine financial management of an appropriation,
   program, or project or to comply with procurement regulations or sound procurement
   practices. Any action taken in this regard must consider the intent of the Congress in
   providing funds as the primary criterion in determining whether a reportable deferral exists.
   Accordingly, DoD responsible for such actions must, at all times, be ready to support these
   judgments to any reviewing authority."

                             PHASES OF MILITARY CONSTRUCTION

  A5.1. Congressional authorization of major construction projects typically represents
  accumulation of planning, programming, and budgeting efforts.
     A5.1.1. First identify a need for additional facilities.
     A5.1.2. Define the need, rank the priority, and compete the projects for available resources.
     A5.1.3. Start the project definition at the installation level and move the project through the
     chain of command for budget submission. Table 9.1 shows the life cycle of a military
     construction project and the 3 to 7 years' process of acquiring a military facility from
     conception to completion.
     A5.1.4. The actual design phase lasts 1 to 2 1/2 years, while the construction phase could
     take 1 to 5 years.
     A5.1.5. The remaining time is to plan, program, budget, design, construct, and financial
     close out. However, the total construction process consists of four phases: planning and
     programming, budgeting, design and construction. (See AFI 32-1021 for details on military
     construction phases.)
  A5.2. Table A5.1 portrays these phases.

                          DEFENSE WORKING CAPITAL FUND

A6.1. Purpose of DWCF:
   A6.1.1. DoD expanded the use of businesslike financial management practices through the
   creation of the Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF) on 1 October 1991 (FY 92).
   Defense Management Report Decision (DMRD) 971, DoD Financial Systems, established
   the DBOF and provided the foundation for operational policies and procedures. The Defense
   Working Capital Funds (DWCF) were established in 1996 and built on the DBOF
   foundation. DWCF operates with financial principles that provide improved cost visibility
   and accountability to enhance business management and improve the decision making
   process. The DWCF builds on revolving fund principles previously used for industrial and
   commercial-type activities. Successful implementation of the DWCF is essential to
   achievement of the following DMR initiatives: 1) consolidating like functions, 2) increasing
   cost visibility, and 3) realizing significant monetary savings through better business
   practices.
   A6.1.2. The establishment of the DWCF does not change previous organizational reporting
   structures or command authority relationships. Combining business activities under a single
   Treasury Code (97*4930) allows consolidation of cash management, while functional and
   cost management responsibilities remain with the Military Departments and Defense
   Agencies.
   A6.1.3. The primary purpose of the DWCF is to provide a business management structure
   that encourages managers and employees of DoD support organizations to provide quality
   products and services at the lowest cost. A major feature of this business management
   structure is increased emphasis on business operations. This business operations structure
   identifies each business area, the products or services, and the total cost of operations within
   that business area.
   A6.1.4. Under this structure, customers establish requirements and are charged, through the
   rate structure, for the cost of industrial and commercial-type services and products provided.
   Providers, in turn, produce quality goods and services which satisfy customer requirements at
   the lowest cost. Support organizations incur costs based on customer orders. This linkage of
   support costs to customer funding ensures better communication between the customer and
   the provider. By making the producing organization responsible for all costs associated with
   delivering the good or service, those managers will identify cost drivers and can focus their
   management improvement efforts accordingly. Better cost visibility enables managers at all
   levels to make informed decisions.
A6.2. Additional guidance on DWCF and the former AF Stock/Industrial Funds is in:

   A6.2.3. DoDI 4000.19, Interservice, Interdepartmental, and Interagency Support.
A6.3. Concept of Operations. The DWCF is an expansion of the existing commercial or
business operations that were previously managed as a revolving fund. The expansion included
some activities which were not previously financed on a revolving fund basis by making them
separate business areas. These areas are accounting and finance services, industrial plant
equipment maintenance and repair, printing services, reutilization and marketing services and
technical information services. The DWCF eliminates direct appropriations for many elements of
cost in existing funds. Sales to customers must reflect total costs not just direct costs.
Replacement of DBOF with DWCF returned cash management responsibilities to the
Components. Although the Military Departments retain control of their respective business areas,
the Service's focus is supposed to be on cost management. A DWCF Financial Policies Board,
chaired by DoD(C), has been created, with representation from defense agency comptrollers and
Service Assistant Secretaries for Financial Management. The policy board reviews new
procedures to improve operating control and identifies new areas for eventual inclusion in the
DWCF.
A6.4. New Business Areas. Criteria for inclusion of a business area in the DWCF are: outputs
of the business have been identified; costs of the business area can be related to the outputs; and
the customers of the business area have been identified. Secretaries of the Military Departments
may submit applications and supporting justification to authorize new DWCF activities or to
rescind the authorization of existing DWCF activities. The DoD Comptroller authorizes or
approves specific DWCF business areas and/or activities and the terms under which such
business areas and/or activities shall be operated.

         BASE CLOSURE: COMPTROLLER DEACTIVATION CHECKLIST

A7.1. As a guide, the installation comptroller normally performs the following deactivation
activities:
   A7.1.1. Ensure continuity of comptroller functions needed to support operational
   requirements during phase down and deactivation.
   A7.1.2. Coordinate with other staff functional areas to determine fund requirements needed
   to support closure plans, and ensure that such funds are available.
   A7.1.3. Ensure that an adequate number of qualified comptroller personnel remain in place
   to effectively manage comptroller supports requirements during phase down and
   deactivation.
   A7.1.4. Suspense and control submission of all OPRs, EPRs, and award recommendations
   well before the CBPO cutoff. Contact local military and civilian personnel offices, as
   necessary to resolve questions concerning military and civilian personnel offices.
   A7.1.5. Designate individual to be responsible for documentation of unit phase out and
   submission of lessons learned.
   A7.1.6. Advise Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA) representative of base closure.
   A7.1.7. Notify commanders of the importance of early identification of losses so required
   reports can be initiated.
   A7.1.8. Notify survey officers to expedite processing of outstanding reports of survey and
   government property loss or damage (GPLD) certificates.
   A7.1.9. Close military finance facility. Notify command and DFAS-DE/AOR, DFAS-
