                                             Chapter 5

                           FOOD ORDERING AND INVENTORY

5.1. Forecasting. The FSO gives the Defense Supply Center - Philadelphia (DSCP) account
manager the forecast for food requirements 60 days in advance for Continental United States
(CONUS) locations and 120 days for overseas (OCONUS) locations. The Prime Vendor (PV)
forecast allows contracts to be tailored to the customer’s requirements and allows the customer
maximum flexibility.
5.2. Ordering. For manual operations, the storeroom clerk uses E-mail to order food. Use
DeCA Form 70-20, Subsistence Request for Issue, Turn-in, or Transfer, when purchasing
from the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) resale store. In automated operations, the
storeroom clerk will input commissary purchases in Aloha’s inventory control. In automated
dining facilities under PV, the user orders directly from the PV through an electronic catalog in
Aloha’s inventory control that lists all the items available for the customer to order. Catalog
updates, requisitions, purchase orders, acknowledgments, and receipts are transmitted
electronically using a closed loop Electronic Commerce system between the customer, the
DSCP, and the contractor.
5.3. Reconciliation. The storeroom manager will turn in all paperwork to the accountant within
24 hours of receipt of food items. The accountant will:
   5.3.1. Record all types of purchases on the SF 1080, Voucher for Transfer Between
   Appropriation and/or Funds.
   5.3.2. In automated operations, verify correct amounts on the Purchase (History) Journal
   and the Receipt Confirmation. If you do not receive receipt confirmation within 2 business
   days, contact STORES helpdesk for further assistance.
   5.3.3. Correct any discrepancies using Inventory Control or STORES Web, as applicable.
   Refer to the CFS Handbook.
   5.3.4. Coordinate discrepancies with the DSCP account manager.
5.4. Inventory Control. To make sure food is controlled from the time of receipt until it’s
served, storeroom clerks:
   5.4.1. Keep high dollar storage areas secured.
   5.4.2. Record all food transferred between facilities, on AF Form 3516, Food Service
   Inventory Transfer Receipt at non-automated operations. For automated operations, a
   transfer-in will be an Invoice Entry and a transfer-out will be an Adjustment Entry. Use the
   CFS Handbook to manage transfers between food service operations.
5.5. Physical Inventory. The storeroom clerk will conduct a weekly inventory as defined by
CFS. The FSO assigns a member other than the storeroom clerk to take a physical inventory of
all food items at the close of business on the last day of the month.
   5.5.1. The person taking the inventory:
 12                                     AFI34-239_BEALEAFBSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


       5.5.1.1. In manual operations, record the inventory count on AF Form 3514, Inventory
       Count Worksheet. In automated operations, record the count on the Count Sheets.
       Enter counts in the Physical Count Entry under Inventory Control.
   5.5.2. The FSO reviews and certifies the inventory.
5.6. End of Fiscal Year (FY) Inventory.
   5.6.1. On the last day of the current fiscal year, the FSO assigns someone outside of food
   service to conduct the physical inventory using the following procedures:
       5.6.1.1. The Food Service Manager will provide the inventory officer with the count
       sheet printed from CFS (Physical Count Entry).
   5.6.2. The inventory officer will count all items in all storage locations, kitchen, and
   production areas assisted by storeroom personnel.
       5.6.2.1. Once the inventory officer completes the counts, storeroom personnel will enter
       the counts into CFS (Physical Count Entry). The inventory officer will verify all counts
       are entered into CFS. Storeroom personnel will save the inventory and reconcile the
       overages and shortages. Once complete, the storeroom clerk will print the Edit List
       Count Sheet. The inventory officer will sign the Edit List Count Sheet, certifying the
       inventory is correct. The Food Service Manager will also sign the Edit List Count Sheet.
   5.6.3. Once inventory is complete save the inventory and close out.
       5.6.3.1. The following day, the manager will process the physical counts. After
       processing physical counts, verify all counts were processed (look in Physical Counts and
       the Event Viewer).
   5.6.4. Once this process is completed food service manager will print out 3 copies of the On
   Hand Summary Report (RCS: HAF-SVO(A)0304)—this is your new fiscal year starting
   inventory. The FSO will sign all the On Hand Summary Reports. Provide one copy to the
   food service accountant—send one copy to your MAJCOM food service manager and one to
   HQ AFSVA/SVOHF. CONTINUE REPORTING DURING MINIMIZE.
5.7. Cost Corrections. Any cost corrections, accomplished in automated operations, which
exceed one percent of the total dollar value of the item class (i.e., beef items are 111, poultry
112, etc.) MAJCOM food service branch must approve. Cost corrections greater than one percent
will be sent through the MAJCOM/SVX or SVP to HQ AFSVA/SVOHF for approval.
5.8. Uniform Requirements. Food Service personnel engaged in the preparation and serving of
food shall be attired in appropriate food service uniforms as prescribed in AFI 36-2903, Dress
and Personal Appearance of AF Personnel.

                  WAR RESERVE MATERIEL (WRM) MANAGEMENT

6.1. Requirements. This section expands on responsibilities and policies in DoD Directive
(DoDD) 3110.6, War Reserve Materiel Policy, and AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM)
Program Guidance and Procedures. The War Consumable Distribution Objective (WCDO),
USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP-1, Annex GG), and MAJCOM Ration Requirements
summary specify the number of days, quantity, and type of rations to be maintained as WRM
funded levels by the principle MAJCOM for storage and use at the operational level.
   6.1.1. Only MAJCOM identified requirements are programmed and funded as WRM.
   Installations must coordinate all Air Force Operational Plan (OPLAN) requirements with
   their MAJCOM/SVX/Logistics Plans Office (LGX) for identification.
   6.1.2. MAJCOM/SVX/LGX provides their WRM ration requirements in writing to HQ
   AFSVA/SVOHF by 15 March annually. Requirements identified for locations that do not
   have an Air Force food service activity assigned will be stored at the nearest Air Force
   installation that has a food service activity.
   6.1.3. MAJCOM/SVX identifies and approves all self-sustaining unit ration requirements in
   their annual ration requirements summary. These units may store their rations instead of food
   service. Rations and all accountable forms will be issued on a hand receipt.
   6.1.4. The total Air Force wartime requirement for operational rations (Unitized Group
   Rations (UGR) and Meals Ready to Eat (MREs)) to support the Air Force two Major Theater
   War (MTW) Regional concept as identified in the Defense Guidance and WMP-1 are
   budgeted for by HQ AFSVA/SVO for storage at active duty bases having a requirement and
   with the Defense Logistics Agency in CONUS and OCONUS.
6.2. Requisitioning. Congress specifically approves WRM ration Essential Station Messing
(ESM) formerly, Subsistence-in-Kind (SIK) funds (3500).
   6.2.1. HQ AFSVA/SVO approves any new or increased WRM requirements and places
   annual requisitions for all CONUS bases. WRM rations are only approved for storage at
   active duty bases that have an Air Force food service activity.
   6.2.2. Bases will not exceed WRM-funded levels.
   6.2.3. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF approves the release of depot-stocked rations for exercise use
   before requisitioning.
6.3. Storage. Where feasible, store all WRM rations under refrigeration (ideal temperature is
35-50 degrees Fahrenheit) to extend their shelf life. The maximum storage life is 36 months at 80
degrees Fahrenheit.
   6.3.1. If current facilities are inadequate for storage of WRM rations, the installation
   commander will provide space elsewhere on base. The facility will be under lock and key
   control of food service personnel and must provide adequate security. Erect a physical barrier
   (floor to ceiling) to prevent theft or pilferage should the facility be jointly used with another
   base activity.
 14                                       AFI34-239_BEALEAFBSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012


   6.3.2. Store WRM rations by lot number and date-of-pack on standard (40‖ X 48‖) size
   pallets.
   6.3.3. WRM rations may be stored in the same warehouse as food service stocks. However,
   they will not be commingled together. WRM and food service rations should not be stacked
   more than three pallets high, without warehouse rack shelving.
   6.3.4. Food Service will not break down or store WRM rations individually on separate
   pallets for units.
   6.3.5. Rations stored by self-sustaining units are issued on AF Form 3516, with a
   Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the services and self-sustaining unit
   commanders. Refer to Attachment 7. Food service must account for these rations in the
   WRM account and report monthly on the AF Form 28, War Reserve Materiel (WRM)
   Ration Report (RCS: HAF-SV(M)9601). Refer to Attachment 8 for reporting procedures.
6.4. Issues and Transfers. Do not issue rations directly from the WRM account. If sufficient
rations are not available in food service and WRM rations have to be used for emergencies,
transfer them to the food service account before issue. The Services commander or designated
representative must approve the release of all WRM rations in coordination with the base War
Reserve Materiel Officer (WRMO) on AF Form 3516.
   6.4.1. Active duty Air Force units cannot use unit funds to purchase operational rations,
   except for survival packets and emergency drinking water. Active duty units must obtain
   rations through food service. Food service will then issue rations to the unit with accountable
   forms and guidance for control of ESM funds when the rations are used. Survival packets and
   drinking water will not be stored in the food service warehouse. Storage of these items is the
   unit’s responsibility.
   6.4.2. Issue all operational rations in full case lots only.
   6.4.3. Include date-of-pack and lot number of the rations issued on AF Form 3516.

   provide DD Form 1222, Request for and Results of Tests, to food service personnel for the
   quantity of destroyed rations during inspection.
   6.4.5. Return operational rations only to food service activities if there is a recurring demand
   for them. Accept full cases only and have Military Public Health inspectors to inspect the
   rations for serviceability before acceptance.
   6.4.6. For support of exercises and contingencies, transfer operational rations from one base
   to another using DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document. A
   document number must be obtained from HQ AFSVA/SVOHF and rations must be inspected
   by Military Public Health inspectors prior to shipment in accordance with DSCP Handbook
   4155.2, Inspection of Meal, Ready-To-Eat (MRE) Rations (Appendix A). A copy of the
   inspection report will accompany the shipment.
6.5. Rotation. MAJCOM/SVX develops and monitors rotation of all pre-positioned WRM
assets including those stored in food service. Rotate MREs annually. Program and requisition
one-third of all WRM-funded levels of MREs annually (in November) based on storage
AFI34-239_BEALEAFBSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2012                                                       15


conditions. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF will also inform the MAJCOM/SVX of the quantities and types
of WRM stocks stored by DSCP in CONUS that require rotation.
   6.5.1. Identify rations not used in local exercises, to the MAJCOM/SVX for redistribution to

   number and date-of-pack in the WRM account monthly. Refer to Attachment 8 for
   additional guidance on reporting periods.
6.6. Inventory. Conduct inventories to determine the monetary value of WRM assets, physical
quantities on hand by date-of-pack, and lot number, to prepare inventory adjustments, or to
certify the financial status of the WRM account. WRM assets will not exceed the funded-level
established by HQ AFSVA. Perform a inventory on the last workday of each month.
   6.6.1. Self-sustaining units will inventory rations issued on an AF Form 3516 monthly, and
   report the results to food service personnel. Include these rations on all physical inventories
   and reports.
6.7. Revaluation. Each fiscal year when the case price of MREs changes, food service will
revalue MRE inventories to account for the unit price change. Two AF Forms 28 will be
submitted. Food Service will conduct an end of fiscal year inventory on 30 September at the old
case price. The quantity will be transferred to a new AF Form 28 for the next fiscal year on 1
October, with the new fiscal year case price.
