12                                                    RAMSTEINABI13-204 31 JULY 2014


     1.9.1.2. Ramp 2 is operated by 86 AMXS. 12 aircraft parking spots numbered 2-1
     through 2-12 are designed to accommodate base assigned C-130s facing to the north.
     Taxilanes oriented east/west are designed to accommodate aircraft with a wingspan of
     130 feet or less; if taxilanes are utilized to accommodate C-130 parking, prior
     coordination with AM is required to ensure appropriate wingtip restrictions are imposed
     for Twy D. Spots 2-1 through 2-8 will be used for normal operations. Spots 2-9 through
     2-12 will only be utilized when use of other available parking spots will impede
     operations. To the maximum extent possible, the remaining aircraft parking spots on
     Ramps 1, 2, and 4 will be fully utilized prior to Spots 2-9 through 2-12 being utilized by
     transient aircraft; all parking spots on Ramp 3 should be utilized prior to use by
     distinguished visitors (DV) support aircraft. See Attachment 5, Airfield Parking Ramp
     1, 2, 3, 4.
     1.9.1.3. Ramp 3 is operated by TA. Four aircraft parking spots are numbered 3-1 through

     aircraft with a wingspan of 132 feet, 7 inches or less; Spots 3-3 through 3-4 are marked to
     accommodate aircraft with a wingspan of 117 feet, 5 inches or less. When requested, TA
     will inform Tower of parking locations for all transient aircraft and base assigned aircraft
     transporting DVs. Note: Spot 3-1 will normally only be utilized to enplane and deplane
     passengers or the time it takes to service the aircraft. The maximum amount of time
     should normally not exceed 1 hour and 15 minutes. If mission requirements dictate
     additional time, users will coordinate with TA for parking at an alternate location and
     then will double-block back to Ramp 3 as necessary. See Attachment 5, Airfield
     Parking Ramp 1, 2, 3, 4.
     1.9.1.4. Ramp 4 is operated by TA; six aircraft parking spots are numbered 4-1 through

     munitions. 4-1 through 4-5 are designed to accommodate C-130s facing south; Spot 4-6
     is designed to accommodate aircraft with a wingspan of 117 feet 5 inches or less (C-40).
     A variety of transient aircraft may park on the ramp, however, marshallers and
     wingwalkers must be provided as necessary. See Attachment 5, Airfield Parking
     Ramp 1, 2, 3, 4.
     1.9.1.5. Ramp 5 is operated by 521 AMOW (AMC) through 721 AMOG. 721 AMXS
     Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) is the ramp coordinating authority for its use.
     Ramp 5 is intended for the primary use of 18 AF (AMC) controlled missions. Transient
     aircraft operating other than 18 AF (AMC) controlled missions may be accommodated on
     a space available basis with appropriate prior coordination through 721 AMXS/MOC.
     Servicing of non-18 AF (AMC) aircraft shall be IAW local maintenance directives.
     Ramp 5’s air terminal jetway parking spots are designated T1 and T2. Power-back taxi is
     not authorized from T1 or T2. Departing aircraft must be pushed back onto a designated
     east/west parking spot for engine start and taxi. Ramp 5 engine run spots R1 and R2
     require aircraft to be towed into place. Aircraft may taxi under power when departing R1
     and R2. See Attachment 6, Airfield Parking Ramp 5.
     1.9.1.6. Ramp 7 (Southwest Area) is controlled by 76th Airlift Squadron (76 AS); there
     are 8 aircraft parking spots, 2 for C-20s and 6 for C-21s. Additional aircraft parking is
     available utlizing hangars and dispersed aircraft shelters. See Attachment 7, Airfield

RAMSTEINABI13-204 31 JULY 2014                                                             13


          1.9.1.6.1. Ramp 7, Spots 7-1 and 7-2 are designed to accommodate C-20s. See
          Attachment 7, Airfield Parking Ramp 7, 8.
          1.9.1.6.2. Ramp 7, Spots 7-3 through 7-8 are designed to accommodate C-21s. Note:
          Spot 7-7 is closed. See Attachment 7, Airfield Parking Ramp 7, 8.
      1.9.1.7. Ramp 8 - Ramp 8 - Hot Cargo Pad (HCP), located on the south side of Runway
      08/26 at the mid-field Taxiway E, is operated by 521 AMOW (AMC) through 721
      AMOG. 721 APS/TROC (Cape Forecasting) is the ramp coordinating authority. There
      are four total aircraft parking spots, but only three are usable at any one time. Ramp 8
      can accommodate up to three C-17 or smaller aircraft for simultaneous operations OR up
      to two commercial wide-body/C-5 type aircraft for simultaneous hot cargo operations.
      Parking is limited to two aircraft (any type), if a commercial wide-body or a C-5 are
      present. See Attachment 7, Airfield Parking Ramp 7, 8.
          1.9.1.7.1. Aircraft with Hazardous Class 1.1, 1.2 or greater than 1,000 pounds net
          explosive weight (NEW) of 1.3 are required to use Ramp 8 when transiting, loading
          or unloading at Ramstein, unless specifically waived by an appropriate authority.
          1.9.1.7.2. Use of Ramp 8 requires a specific Prior Permision Required (PPR) from
          721 APS/TROC. This PPR is in addition to the PPR required/issued by 86
          OSS/OSAA for general use of Ramstein Air Base. Ramp 8 PPRs are approved using
          JCS priority, munitions load and projected availability at the time of the request.
          Higher priority munitions missions may subsequently bump lower priority missions
          or non-munitions missions after PPRs are issued. In such cases, requestors will
          generally be notified for mitigation. In some cases aircraft may be required to be
          downloaded and/or towed to accommodate higher priority munitions movements.
          Failure to coordinate a PPR with 721 APS/TROC may result in denied access during
          mission execution.
          1.9.1.7.3. Aircraft block in/block out activities are controlled through 721
          AMXS/MOC. Inbound aircraft, regardless of type, with a PPR for the HCP shall
          contact Ramstein AMCC NLT 30 minutes prior to arrival for final parking
          coordination. Unexpected aircraft diverts may be accommodated on a space available
          basis. However, divert aircraft may encounter parking delay until appropriate
          coordination can be accomplished and/or space becomes available. As much advance
          notice/coordination as possible will ensure the best possible success.
      1.9.1.8. Building 2525, 2526, 2524 (the Three Amigos) are controlled by 86th Munitions
      Squadron (86 MUNS). There are two aircraft shelters (HS-131 & HS-132) designated to
      accommodate aircraft with forward firing munitions.
   1.9.2. Deviation from marked parking plans should be forwarded to the Airfield Manager
   (AFM) for coordination and approval at least 48 hours prior to planned deviation. AM will
   inform Tower of parking deviations.
1.10. Air Traffic Control Facilities. Ramstein AB has a VFR Control Tower and a GCA
facility.

        west, in alignment with nose wheel block/centerline. (See Notes 1 and 2)

 Note 1: Safety spotters will be positioned to ensure nothing passes within 1,000 feet behind
 the aircraft.

 Note 2: Any maintenance runs on these spots must be coordinated through 86 MXG/MOC,
 721AMXS/MOC, and the Air Terminal Operations Center.

 SOUTH WEST AREA (Ramp 7)

   1     C-21 engine runs authorized at HS-91 only.

 Note 3: All aircraft are authorized engine runs to include full power on the hammerheads for minor
 maintenance problems only.

 Note 4: C-130 engine compressor washes can only be accomplished on Ramp 1 using a wash
 containment system. If a wash containment system is not available, engine compressor
 washes are prohibited.

 Note 5: All engine run procedures to include power and direction, are the responsibility of
 the 86 MXG. Aircrew members or engine run supervisors assume full responsibility for the
 safety of all surround personnel and equipment. Tower serves only to approve engine runs for
 anti-hijack purposes. 86 OSS/OSA takes no responsibility for incorrect engine run
 procedures.

1.24. Noise Abatement Procedures. To minimize noise pollution for the Ramstein AB
workforce and surrounding communities, the following procedures and restrictions apply:
   1.24.1. Reverse thrust. Aircrews will use powered reverse thrust to the minimum extent
   necessary for safe operations.
   1.24.2. Approach procedures. Aircrews will utilize German civil airfield approach
   procedures as specified in FLIP AP/2 to the maximum extent possible. For ILS approaches,
   crews should establish final configuration by the final approach fix as depicted for the
   localizer approach.
   1.24.3. Visual approaches should avoid overflight of towns and villages. When approaching
   from the east, execute the Autobahn 6 Visual Approach for Rwy 26 or 27 (See FLIPS) to
   avoid overflight of the city center.
   1.24.4. Quiet hours. Ramstein AB quiet hours are defined as periods when only mission-
   essential arrivals/departures/engine runs will be authorized. Authorization is granted on a
   case-by-case basis.
       1.24.4.1. Established quiet hours for arrivals and departures at Ramstein AB are in effect
       Monday through Saturday, 2200L to 0600L. Engine start is not authorized prior to
       0600L without a quiet hour waiver. Note: Tower personnel have approval authority to
       taxi aircraft to parking that land at or before 2200L.
RAMSTEINABI13-204 31 JULY 2014                                                                23


       1.24.4.2. On Sundays and German holidays, quiet hours remain in effect until 1300L.
       Engine start is approved 30 minutes prior to the end of quiet hours, but aircraft cannot
       depart prior to 1300L.
   1.24.5. Quiet hour waivers.
       1.24.5.1. Requesting agencies will contact 86 AW/CP to coordinate quiet hour waivers
       (QHW).
       1.24.5.2. 86 AW/CP processes requests with 86 OG/CC/CD and notifies the requesting
       agency of final approval/disapproval; 86 AW/CP will notify tower and AM of any
       approvals daily.
       1.24.5.3. Quiet hour waivers (QHW) are approved for the following missions:
          1.24.5.3.1. TACC may expect QHW approval for any aircraft carrying human
          remains (HR), conducting aeromedical evacuations (AE), or those on WX diverts or
          in-flight emergencies (IFE). Moreover, TACC may plan for an additional six QHWs
          per day (above those granted for HR, AE, WX, and IFEs) for aircraft flying critical
          contingency movements. These six QHWs are tracked by 86 AW/CP. Note: If
          TACC identifies a surge requirement, the number of planned QHWs may be
          increased for the duration of the surge.
          1.24.5.3.2. All aircraft maintenance engine runs at idle power 1900L-2200L.
          1.24.5.3.3. C-17 maintenance engine runs at idle power 2200L-0700L for 1B1 or
          higher missions departing ETAR for contingency deployments, but not for de-
          positioning legs to CONUS.
          1.24.5.3.4. Maintenance engine runs up to takeoff power for aircraft supporting the
          following missions:
              1.24.5.3.4.1. 1A1, 1A2, 1A3 priority missions.
              1.24.5.3.4.2. Urgent and priority aeromedical evacuations
              1.24.5.3.4.3. Repatriatrion of human remains
Note: Takeoff power engine runs will be IAW 86 AW policy and German ATAP (i.e.- no
more than two engines at a time). 1.24.5.3.5. Take-offs/landings during quiet hours for all
aircraft types for the following missions:
              1.24.5.3.5.1. 1A1, 1A2, 1A3 missions
              1.24.5.3.5.2. Urgent and priority aeromedical evacuations
              1.24.5.3.5.3. Repatriatrion of human remains
              1.24.5.3.5.4. Weather diverts
              1.24.5.3.5.5. IFEs (follow QRC guidance for notification)
   1.24.6. Aircraft operations during quiet hours. The following general guidance will be
   applied to reduce noise pollution during quiet hours without negatively impacting the
   mission:
 24                                                    RAMSTEINABI13-204 31 JULY 2014


      1.24.6.1. Aircrews and maintainers will operate their aircraft/engines so as to produce
      the least amount of noise consistent with safety of flight/mission accomplishment.
      1.24.6.2. During quiet hours, pilots with quiet hour approval are only authorized one
      instrument approach to a full stop landing and/or one departure.
      1.24.6.3. Aircraft are not authorized VFR patterns on weekends and German holidays
      except in emergency situations or upon approval by the 86 OG/CC.
      1.24.6.4. When quiet hour operations are authorized, Tower will advise pilots to avoid
      overflight of populated areas.
   1.24.7. Avoidance of populated areas. Aircraft will avoid overflying villages to the
   maximum extent possible, except as required in an emergency, or when executing a
   departure procedure (DP). Note: If VMC on a DP/ATC instructions, course corrections are
   approved until leaving the class D airspace.
   1.24.8. Avoidance of USAFE HQ and CC Air Ramstein area. To the maximum extent
   possible, aircraft will avoid over flight of the areas on Ramstein Air Base encompassing
   USAFE headquarters and CC Air Ramstein buildings below 3,600 ft. Arriving VFR aircraft
   will be instructed to land via runway or taxiways in such a manner that avoids this area.
   Transient VFR aircraft when crossing the airport north/south bound will be instructed to
   cross the east or west ends of the runway and avoid mid field over flight. Transient VFR
   aircraft crossing the class delta surface area east/west bound will remain south of the runway
   or four miles north until past the end of the runway for their direction of flight. Pipeline
   inspection helicopters, federal agency and emergency response operations aircraft are exempt
   from this restriction.
1.25. Procedures for Protecting Precision Approach Critical Areas- ILS CAT I/II/IIIa.
   1.25.1. No aircraft, vehicle, or personnel shall be allowed in, or be allowed to enter into the
   ILS critical area when an ILS approach is in progress. See Attachment 10, ILS CAT II/IIIa
   Critical Areas.
      1.25.1.1. All aircraft, vehicles and personnel will stop at the appropriate ILS Category
      instrument hold lines and contact Tower for permission to enter the CMA/runways.
      Exception: Separation between one approaching aircraft and another approaching or
      departing aircraft shall be provided in such a way as to ensure that approaching and
      departing aircraft, taxiing aircraft or vehicles do not cause any ILS signal interference
      when the approaching aircraft is within 2 NM of the runway threshold.
      1.25.1.2. Locally assigned aircraft are authorized to taxi to/from Runway 08/26 to
      Ramps 3, 4, and 7 when the RVR is at or above 200m. “Follow Me” service is available
      upon pilot request. In the event RVR falls below 200m, “Follow-Me” service is required.
      Exception to this policy requires 86 OG/CC approval.
      1.25.1.3. When operating in CAT II/IIIa, certain outages to airfield lighting systems may
      result in a downgrade to the ILS Category IAW BesAnMilFS 2-100. In such instances,
      AM will publish a NOTAM informing aircrews and will ring out the secondary crash net
      informing base agencies of the downgrade to available service.

                                    FLYING AREAS

2.1. Local Flying Area/Designation of Airspace
   2.1.1. Ramstein Class D airspace. Airspace measuring 14 nautical miles (NM) by 7 NM
   from the surface up to and including 3600 ft MSL: 4 NM north and 3 NM south of Rwy
   09/27 centerline, 7 NM east and 7 NM west centered on Rwy 09/27. See Attachment 9,
   Class D Airspace/VFR Overhead/Inside Closed Pattern for depiction.
   2.1.2. Ramstein GCA airspace. Class E airspace from the surface up to and including 5000
   feet MSL, approximately 20 NM by 40 NM total, only about 20 NM by 25 NM controlled by
   Ramstein at any time, depending on active runway. See Attachment 8, Class E
   Airspace/Radar Pattern for depiction. Note: See DoD FLIP VFR ARRIVAL/
   DEPARTURE ROUTES EUROPE for additional information.
2.2. VFR Local Training Areas.
      2.2.1.1. Aircrews are restricted from conducting full procedure approaches from MAPIG
      and/or holding at MAPIG during VMC, unless flying in VMC conditions above a ceiling
      that is prohibitive to glider activity.
      2.2.1.2. Aircrews receiving vectors to RWY 08/09 should expect and request short
      vectors to maintain maximum separation from MAPIG.
RAMSTEINABI13-204 31 JULY 2014                                                                29

                                    VFR PROCEDURES

3.1. VFR Weather Minimums.
   3.1.1. IAW FAAO 7110.65, visual flight rules are in effect when observed weather is equal
   to or greater than 1,000 ft ceiling and/or equal to or greater than 5,000 meters prevailing
   visibility. For noise abatement purposes, fighter aircraft will not depart VFR with ceiling
   less than 3,700 ft and prevailing visibility less than 5,000 meters.
3.2. VFR Traffic Patterns. See Attachment 9, Class D Airspace/VFR Overhead/Inside
Closed Pattern
   3.2.1. Class D airspace entry procedures, standard Tower frequency/VFR reporting points.
      3.2.1.1. Pilots must establish two-way radio communication with the Tower and obtain
      approval for the requested pattern to be flown prior to entering class D airspace.
      3.2.1.2. The primary Tower radio frequency for all aircraft conducting operations in
      class D airspace is VHF 133.2.
      3.2.1.3. The VFR reporting points are ECHO (062-R/5.2 DME), WISKY (291-R/6.6
      DME) and PIVOT (352-R/6.6 DME). All radials and DME are from Ramstein’s
      TACAN. Note 1: Pilots must be familiar with the VFR entry/reporting points listed in
      Attachment 9, Class D Airspace/VFR Overhead/Inside Closed Pattern prior to
      working in class D airspace. Unless otherwise coordinated, enter class D airspace and
      proceed to the approved reporting point at or below 3,000 MSL. Note 2: Expect
      extensive glider activities in the vicinity of Ramstein AB during VFR conditions. Local
      gliders are not in communication with Ramstein GCA and are not transponder equipped
      to provide traffic alert and collision avoidance system guidance. Aircrews should be
      extremely vigilant when operating in the vicinity of Ramstein. Note 3: All local
      assigned aircraft will exercise caution when traversing points WISKY, PIVOT, and
      ECHO in the local pattern. The Potzberg Hotel (Castle) performs aviary shows at their
      location. The risk of striking a very large predatory bird is increased over the area and
      aircrews must avoid direct over-flight. Crews should plan to avoid the area (49˚31.20’ N
      and 7˚28.80’ E) by at least ½ NM.
   3.2.2. Pattern use/deviations.
      3.2.2.1. VFR patterns are authorized for use by all locally assigned 86 AW aircraft only,
      unless otherwise specified. Transient aircraft may fly the VFR pattern when an abnormal
      or emergency situation exists or when authorized by the OG/CC.
      3.2.2.2. USAFE fighter aircraft are authorized to recover using the overhead pattern.
      However, aircraft desiring multiple approaches must execute their option back to the
      GCA radar pattern.
      3.2.2.3. VFR patterns are closed during quiet hours, weekends and German holidays.
   3.2.3. Pattern Profiles.
      3.2.3.1. Closed Traffic Patterns.

          3.2.3.1.1. Pattern altitude is 2,000 MSL.
          3.2.3.1.2. Weather criteria. Ceiling at or above 1,700 AGL and visibility at or above
          5,000 m.
          3.2.3.1.3. Pattern Profile. Aircraft must request and tower must specifically approve
          “inside” or “outside” closed traffic prior to the aircraft commencing the procedure.
          See Attachment 9, Class D Airspace/VFR Overhead/Inside Closed Pattern
              3.2.3.1.3.1. Outside closed traffic pattern profile. Remain outside Ramstein
              Village, Miesenbach, and Ramstein AB housing area, but inside Mackenbach.
              3.2.3.1.3.2. Inside closed traffic pattern profile (Runway 26/27 only). Remain
              inside Ramstein AB, avoiding Ramstein Village, Ramstein High School, and
              USAFE/NATO Headquarters buildings to the maximum extent possible. Note:
              Simulated engine-out pattern deviation requires Tower approval.
  3.2.4. Overhead pattern. See Attachment 9, Class D Airspace/VFR Overhead/Inside
  Closed Pattern for depiction.
      3.2.4.1. Pattern altitude is 3,000 MSL until either points WISKY or ECHO and 2,500
      MSL after passing points WISKY or ECHO.
      3.2.4.2. Weather criteria. Ceiling at or above 2,700 AGL and visibility at or above
      5,000m.
      3.2.4.3. Pattern profile. Proceed to points WISKY at 3,000 MSL for initial to Rwy 08/09
      or ECHO at 3,000 MSL for initial to Rwy 26/27, as directed by Tower. Only right breaks
      will be made to both runways and pilots will remain clear of all no-fly areas. Exception:
      If ATC requires C-21 aircraft to break past the approach end when Rwy 08/09 are in use,
      a left break will be used to avoid overflying Kindsbach village. Additionally, when a left
      break is used, C-21 aircraft will avoid overflying Ramstein village to the north and turn
      base around the water tower. Subsequent patterns will reenter initial avoiding villages for
      noise abatement (Attachment 9, Class D Airspace/VFR Overhead/Inside Closed
      Pattern).
  3.2.5. Vectors to initial.

  3.3.3. Paradrop Operations. Ramstein AB does not allow paradrop operations.
  3.3.4. Drop Zone (DZ) Procedures.
     3.3.4.1. The ATAP governs the establishment of the DZ. Ramstein Air Base sits on a
     biotope (nature preserve) which is a habitat for different protected insect breeds. As
     such, German law outlines specific restrictions to the dimensions and use (including
     approval) of the DZ:
     3.3.4.2. The number of flights for dropping purposes within the drop zone is limited to 8
     over flights per week, whereupon, as a rule, three over flights between departure and
     landing will take place. As a rule, each aircraft drops off a sandbag which is attached to a
     parachute and weighs approx. 7 kg. In addition to dropping off sandbags, groups of up to
     ten paratroopers will jump into the drop zone. The minimum altitude for over flights will
     be 500 ft (150 meters) and the maximum altitude will be 1500 ft (460 meters). The
     approach to the drop zone is conducted north of ILS 26 in an angle of 6.5º to the basic
     approach line 26 (track angle 256.9 º), directly towards the impact point, which is located
     in the center of runways 26 and 27 at a distance of 375 meters from the easterly edge of
     the drop zone. The user is enjoined to refrain from using the drop zone when the ground
     is predominantly damp or wet." (ATAP, 2006).
     3.3.4.3. Actual airdrops require the approval of 86 OG/CC and must be coordinated with
     the ATAP authority via the 86 AW Host Nation Office.

                                            Chapter 4

                  INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES (IFR) PROCEDURES

4.1. Radar Traffic Patterns. The radar traffic pattern will normally be flown at 4,000/5,000
feet, north downwind, and expect vectors from Ramstein GCA to the final approach course. See
Attachment 8, Class E Airspace/Radar Pattern.
4.2. Availability Restrictions for DASR Approaches and PAR                            Approaches/
Monitoring. Ramstein AB does not have DASR or PAR approaches available.
4.3. Local Departure Procedures. Tower is required by host nation agreement to request all
IFR departure clearances no earlier than 20 minutes prior to departure. Therefore, pilots can
expect their clearance with ground control after requesting taxi instructions. Standard instrument
departure procedures are listed in the DoD Flight Information Publication (Terminal) Vol-3,
High and Low Altitude Europe, North Africa and Middle East.
   4.3.1. Expect Toley 2 departure for Rwy 26/27.
   4.3.2. Expect Bolki 2 departure for Rwy 08/09.
4.4. Radar Vector to Initial Procedures. Radar vectors to initial and visual approaches are
available upon request, traffic permitting. For noise abatement, aircraft under control of
Ramstein GCA will be issued radar vectors to a point no closer than 7 NM straight-in final.
4.5. Standard Climb-out Instructions/Procedures. Only local aircraft are authorized to use
abbreviated IFR climb-out instructions. All transient aircraft must receive ATC instructions for
departures into the local IFR pattern or utilize the published departure procedure instructed by
ATC. Note: Transient aircraft shall not be issued local ATC instructions for departures into the
IFR pattern as a “work-around” for specified climb gradients published in the departure
procedures.
   4.5.1. Standard local climb-out procedures are listed below.
       4.5.1.1. ATC Phraseology: “AFTER COMPLETING (low approach, touch and go,
       option), EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT RUNWAY (designator), TRACK
       050/269/275 (if applicable).” Note: The use of “LOCAL CLIMBOUT” phraseology
       constitutes an abbreviated IFR clearance for locally assigned aircraft that are transitioning
       from Tower to the Ramstein radar pattern.
       4.5.1.2. Rwy 08 local climb-out:
               CLIMB ON TRACK 080 TO 4,000 UPON PASSING 1,300 FT AND 3 DME/2 NM
               FROM DER TURN LEFT TO TRACK 360.
       4.5.1.3. Rwy 09 local climb-out:
               CLIMB ON TRACK 080 TO 4,000, UPON PASSING 1,600 FT AND 3 DME/2
               NM FROM DER TURN LEFT TO TRACK 360. MINIMUM CLIMB GRADIENT
               240 FT/NM TO 1400 FT.
RAMSTEINABI13-204 31 JULY 2014                                                               41


      4.5.1.4. Rwy 26 local climb-out 050 track:
              CLIMB ON TRACK 275 TO 4,000 FT, UPON PASSING 1,200 FT AND 2 DME/
              2NM FROM DER TURN RIGHT TO 050. MINIMUM CLIMB GRADIENT 220
              FT/NM TO 4,000 FT.
      4.5.1.5. Rwy 26 local climb-out 275 track:
              CLIMB ON TRACK 275 TO 4,000.
      4.5.1.6. Rwy 27 local climb-out 050 track:
              CLIMB ON TRACK 270 TO 4,000 FT, UPON PASSING 1,400 FT AND 2 DME/2
              NM FROM DER TURN RIGHT TO 050. MINIMUM CLIMB GRADIENT 220
              FT/NM TO 4,000 FT.
      4.5.1.7. Rwy 27 local climb-out 270 track:
              CLIMB ON TRACK 270 TO 4,000. Note: During TACAN out procedures,
              aircraft will be given NM versus DME.
4.6. IFR Arrival Procedures.
   4.6.1. Unless otherwise requested, pilots should expect ILS approach.
   4.6.2. Reference speeds. C-130: 170 KIAS; C-21: 200 KIAS; C-20: 200 KIAS; and C-40:
   200 KIAS.
   4.6.3. Circling approaches. Available upon request, traffic permitting. Circling is not
   authorized south of Rwy 08/26 IAW DoD Terminal FLIP. Tower will instruct transient
   aircrews to avoid overflying local villages to the maximum extent possible. If executing an
   approach to Rwy 08 and circling to land 26, use CAT C mins and if executing an approach to
   Rwy 26 to circle to land 08, use CAT E mins (noise abatement).
   4.6.4. Full stop/stop and go operations. Aircraft that desire a full stop/stop and go landing
   shall advise both GCA and Tower on initial call-up to aid in sequencing other aircraft in the
   pattern.
   4.6.5. C-130 formation procedures. GCA should allow for 1 NM per aircraft in formation
   between turns/vectors (i.e., flight of four requires 4 NM between turns/vectors).
4.7. Breakout/Go-Around/Missed Approach Procedures.
   4.7.1. Breakout procedures. When an aircraft/flight is at 6 miles or farther: " FLY
   RUNWAY HEADING, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 5,000".
   4.7.2. Go-around procedures.
      4.7.2.1. When an aircraft/flight is less than 6 miles and the overhead is in use: "FLY
      RUNWAY HEADING, MAINTAIN 2,000 FEET UNTIL DEPARTURE END, THEN
      CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 5,000 ".
      4.7.2.2. In the event of an aircraft in departure position on the runway, Tower will issue
      “Go-around left (Rwys 26/27) or right (Rwys 08/09)”. Aircraft will offset 200 feet south
      of the runway, and then fly standard go-around procedures. Note: The 2,000 foot
      restriction is not required when no conflict exists with aircraft in the Tower overhead
      pattern.
 42                                                      RAMSTEINABI13-204 31 JULY 2014


   4.7.3. Missed approach procedures. Pilots will fly the missed approach procedure for the
   published approach they are executing, unless otherwise instructed by ATC. If no published
   missed approach procedure exists, pilots will execute go-around procedures and notify ATC.
4.8. Station Keeping Equipment (SKE) Procedures. C-130J aircraft are equipped with SKE
technology which allows pilots to maintain pre-set formation parameters using either manual or
automated flight. Standard SKE formation approaches into ETAR will include up to four
aircraft.
   4.8.1. Spacing and Airspeed. Pilots shall inform ATC when SKE procedures are in effect.
   Between 10 and 20 miles from the FAF, formations will establish standard spacing of 6,000
   feet in trail from the previous aircraft in preparation for the instrument approach. Formation
   aircraft will slow from their en-route airspeed to 150 knots within 10 miles of the FAF, and
   will slow to 135 knots within 1 mile of the FAF. Formation aircraft will maintain 135 knots
   until short final at which point they will transition to the appropriate approach speed based on
   individual aircraft weight and wind conditions. Speed restrictions for formation aircraft
   executing SKE procedures are not authorized.
   4.8.2. Vectors. Due to SKE technology limitations, GCA vectors of 90 degrees or less are
   preferred. If a turn of greater than 90 degrees is required, controllers will break the turn into
   two or more subsequent vectors, if able. In the interest of flight safety, pilots must comply
   with ATC instruction at all times and cannot resume their own headings without ATC
   approval. All vectors and headings will be situational based upon traffic.
   4.8.3. Holding. SKE formations are restricted in their maneuverability when entering a
   holding pattern. If holding is required as a result of a delay or cancellation of approach
   clearance, “large box” vectors are preferred. If unable to accommodate this request, expect
   that the lead aircraft to coordinate for formation split prior to holding pattern entry. Aircraft
   will continue the approach as separate elements.
   4.8.4. Altitudes. When traffic and airspace permit, the earliest possible descent from an en-
   route altitude to a FAF altitude is preferred, and will best set up the formation for an
   instrument approach. For example, clearing the formation to 5,000 feet no later than 10 NM
   prior to point FRANK allows the formation to capture the glideslope prior to the FAF while
   complying with approach restrictions. Altitude descent will be situational based upon traffic.

5.13. Alternate Facility Procedures. In the event of an evacuation of the Tower to the
alternate Control Tower, the following procedures apply:
   5.13.1. All aircraft will be transferred to GCA control (Langen ACC during GCA closures)
   until the ACT is operational, normally within 15 minutes. Mitchell Ave. and taxiway caution
   lights will not be activated during this time, personnel transiting these routes must use
   caution.
   5.13.2. ACT limitations. Visibility on the ground and in the pattern is limited, due to the
   position and height of the alternate facility. All northern taxiways, except Twy Echo, are not
   visible from the ACT. Note: VFR patterns will be closed, only full stops are authorized.
   5.13.3. . Tower will make the following transmission on all assigned frequencies including
   121.5 and 243.0, time permitting: “ATTENTION ALL AIRCRAFT, RAMSTEIN TOWER
   IS EVACUATING, CONTACT RAMSTEIN GCA ON 124.275/356.225 (OR LANGEN
   ACC 129.675/272.8/256.675) FOR INFORMATION AND ADVISORIES.”

                           FLIGHT PLANNING PROCEDURES

6.1. Responsibilities.
   6.1.1. Aircraft commanders:
       6.1.1.1. Ensure IFR flight plans are filed at least 4 hours prior to estimated time of
       departure (ETD), and VFR flight plans are filed 1 hour prior to ETD. Special operations
       and procedures may require earlier filing. Consult Area Planning 2 (AP2) for additional
       lead times.
       6.1.1.2. With the exception of AMC (Air Mobility Command) aircrews with a flight plan
       on file with MAJCOM flight planning cell, contracted air carriers, general aviation, and
       Army helicopters who have flight plans on file with Army Flight Operations Detachment
       (AFOD), all aircrews departing ETAR must have a flight plan on file with AMOPS.
           6.1.1.2.1. Use DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan IAW AFI 11-202v3,
           General Flight Rules and FLIP General Planning.
           6.1.1.2.2. Use DD Form 1801 or contact dispatch agency for all changes to flight
           plans prior to departing.
   6.1.2. AMC procedures.
       6.1.2.1. AMC aircrews will have flight plans pre-filed through the integrated flight
       manager.
       6.1.2.2. AMC aircrews or Air Mobility Control Center will coordinate any flight plan
       changes with the integrated flight manager or 603rd Air Operations Center/Air Mobility
       Division (603 AOC/AMD).
       6.1.2.3. Flight plans filed electronically shall be archived in GDSS2 IAW Air Force
       RDS, Table 13-07, Rule 3.00.
   6.1.3. Locally assigned aircrews:
       6.1.3.1. File flight plans IAW AFI 11-255v3 and local directives.
       6.1.3.2. Contact 603 AOC/AMD initiation cell to determine an alternate method when
       electronic filing is not possible.
       6.1.3.3. Contact flying squadron or 603 AOC/AMD for any flight plan changes needed
       while en route. Note: Transient aircrews must file all flight plans at AM Ops counter. If
       flight plan was filed at a previous location, AM personnel will determine existence of
       flight plan in GDSS2. If it cannot be located, transient aircrews must re-file.
   6.1.4. AM will:
       6.1.4.1. Review flight plans filed at AM for compliance with FLIP General Planning.
       6.1.4.2. Submit all flight plans for US and foreign aircrews not supported by AMD or
       AMC IAW FLIP General Planning,
       6.1.4.3. Maintain original flight plans IAW Air Force RDS, Table 13-07, Rule 3.00.
 50                                                    RAMSTEINABI13-204 31 JULY 2014


   6.1.5. The pilot in command is responsible to identify flight plan changes due to weather,
   ground aborts or other mission requirements as soon as possible. The pilot may submit
   requests for changes to ATC for coordination with AMD. Expect a delay, for identification,
   while AMD coordinates a new slot time for departure.
   6.1.6. Once an aircraft is airborne, any corrections or deviations to a flight plan must be
   coordinated through the air traffic control agency currently in contact with the aircraft.
   6.1.7. Problems with flight plans (i.e., route of flight, missing data) and air traffic flow
   management messaging will be handled by calling the affected flying squadron and
   coordinating with the on-duty operations officer to correct the problem. The on-duty
   operations officer shall be responsible for correcting or re-filing the flight plan for the
   aircrew to prevent mission delay.
   6.1.8. Electronic flight plan filing:
      6.1.8.1. Configure computers by downloading and following instructions posted on the
      DD Form 1801.
      6.1.8.2. Electronic flight plan and air traffic flow management messaging: Check FLIP
      Area Planning AP/2 and download instructions from the Form.
6.2. Slot Times and Flow Control.
   6.2.1. The two terms, slot time and flow control, are not controlled by AMD or the US
   government, but are flight restrictions imposed and controlled by several European air traffic
   control organizations.
      6.2.1.1. Flow control means that at a certain point or region (i.e., flight information
      region boundary) ATC authorities can and/or will only handle a certain number of
      aircraft per hour.
      6.2.1.2. Slot time, or calculated takeoff time (CTOT) is a 15-minute window, during
      which an aircraft can depart. Slot time is issued to Ramstein from Eurocontrol through
      GDSS2, and then passed to aircraft.
      6.2.1.3. To comply with European flow control restrictions, Tower controllers will not
      issue clearances allowing aircraft to depart more than 5 minutes before or 10 minutes
      after an assigned CTOT. Note: CTOTs are displayed in the GDSS2. Ground control
      will ensure aircrews have the correct slot time on initial contact. AMD cannot request
      slot times--they can delay, send "ready messages" or cancel the flight plan. Sending a
      ready message does not always mean the aircraft will get a better slot time. Departure
      will be slot time -5/+10 minutes.
   6.2.2. Flow control exempt flights. Flow control exemption shall be in accordance with
   FLIP Area Planning AP/2, Theater Supplementary Notices and Procedures.

                            LOW VISIBILITY PROCEDURES

8.1. Low Visibility Operations.
   8.1.1. Tower will notify AM when changes in weather create changes in low visibility
   conditions. AM will report changes in low visibility conditions via the secondary crash net.
   8.1.2. Ramp managers shall establish one central point of contact (POC) for their respective
   ramps.
   8.1.3. When RVR is less than 800 meters and the ceiling is less than 200 feet, the CMA is
   restricted to mission critical vehicles.
8.2. Low Visibility Conditions (VISCONs). When the RVR is at or below 400 meters, four
VISCONs exist as defined below.
   8.2.1. VISCON 1. VISCON 1 will be in effect when the RVR is between 200 meters and
   400 meters, inclusive. While in VISCON 1, all operators on the airfield will wear reflective
   gear and all drivers will turn on vehicle headlights and flashing lights.
      8.2.1.1. Vehicle operations. Only mission critical vehicles are authorized to operate in
      the CMA and must activate flashing/hazard lights at all times.

Terms
Category I (CAT I) operation—. A precision instrument approach and landing with a decision
height not lower than 60 m (200 ft) and with either a visibility not less than 800 m or a runway visual
range not less than 550 m.
Category II (CAT II) operation—. A precision instrument approach and landing with a decision
height lower than 60 m (200 ft), but not lower than 30 m (100 ft), and a runway visual range not less
than 350 m.
Category IIIa (CAT IIIa) operation.—A precision instrument approach and landing with:
a) a decision height lower than 30 m (100 ft) or no decision height; and
b) a runway visual range not less than 200 m.
All Weather Operations.—Any taxi, take-off or landing operations in conditions where visual
reference is limited by weather conditions.
ILS critical area.—An area of defined dimensions about the localizer and glide path antennas where
vehicles, including aircraft, are excluded during all ILS operations. The critical area is protected
because the presence of vehicles and/or aircraft inside its boundaries will cause unacceptable
disturbance to the ILS signal in-space.
ILS sensitive area.—An area extending beyond the critical area where the parking and/or movement
of vehicles, including aircraft, is controlled to prevent the possibility of unacceptable interference to
the ILS signal during ILS operations. The sensitive area is protected to provide normally within the
airfield boundary.

        AIRCRAFT ARRESTING BARRIER ENGAGEMENTS PROCEDURES

Table A4.1. Barrier Engagement Procedures.

INITIAL RESPONSE AND ASSEMBLY

This will be dictated by the type of barrier engagement.

Fire Department vehicles will be positioned at designated locations along the runway
according to the established response plan.

Barrier maintenance will report to the applicable aircraft arresting system. After normal
duty hours, barrier-qualified fire department personnel, if available, will report to the
aircraft arresting system.

The following agencies will assemble at the intersection of the road leading past Airfield
Management and the north crash access road.
Crash recovery
Ambulance
Airfield Management will position for immediate runway access.
TA will respond for fighter aircraft.

RUNWAY OPERATIONS SUSPENDED

When the aircraft has engaged the barrier, Airfield Management will notify Tower over
the ramp net that runway ops are suspended.

Airfield Management will notify 86 AW/CP and take appropriate NOTAM action.

Traffic and workload permitting, Tower will broadcast on guard frequency that ops are
suspended and the estimated time they will resume.

RUNWAY RESPONSE

Fire department and crash recovery vehicles will respond to the aircraft upon clearance
from the Tower.

Barrier maintenance will report to the pits. After normal duty hours and on weekends,
qualified fire department personnel will report to the barrier pit area.

Airfield Management will obtain clearance from the Tower and inspect the runway for
debris.

All other agencies will respond to the aircraft only at the direction of the incident
response commander.
RAMSTEINABI13-204 31 JULY 2014                                                                 69


The fire department official in command will ensure the aircraft is fire-safe and advise the
Tower of assistance requirements. The Tower will relay the requirement to the Airfield
Management representative. Vehicles not requested will remain at the assembly point.

The aircraft commander and the 86 OG/CC will determine if the aircraft is capable of
self extraction based on aircraft type and mechanical state.

AIRCRAFT EXTRACTION

Hand signals will be used by fire protection and crash recovery personnel.

Fire Department and/or Crash Recovery personnel will remove the aircraft from the
barrier cable and contact 786 CES service call for standby response to put the arresting
system back in service.

If the aircraft is damaged or disabled, routine priority will normally be used to remove
it.

If emergency (30 minutes) or urgent (1+30) priority criteria are to be used, the final
decision will be made by the 86 OG/CC.

Note: If prior to the engagement the aircraft commander notifies the Tower with intentions
to shut down or determines the situation will warrant shutdown, fire department and crash
recovery may proceed onto the runway after receiving clearance from the Tower.

RESUMING RUNWAY OPERATIONS

As the barrier engagement extraction progresses, the incident response commander will
pass estimates to the Tower of how long it will take to resume runway ops.

Tower will advise GCA of the anticipated opening time. Tower will advise the incident
response commander of any impending emergencies while the engagement clearance is
in progress.

As the aircraft is being removed (either by taxi or tow), the Airfield Management
representative will check the runway for debris and call the sweeper if necessary.

Power Production standby personnel will perform the post-engagement inspection and
notify Airfield Management/Control Tower when the system is operational. When all
vehicles are off the runway, the barrier tape rewound, and the runway clear, the Airfield
Management representative will notify AM Operations and Tower when runway ops can
be resumed. Only Power Production/Barrier Maintenance can return the system to
operational status, if they are not available the system will not, under any circumstance,
be returned to service. Emergency aircraft will be directed to remaining serviceable
arresting system. AM Ops will then notify the 86 AW/CP and take the appropriate
NOTAM action.
