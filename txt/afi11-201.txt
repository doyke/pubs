                                               Chapter 1

                                RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATIONS

1.1. AFFSA/A3I. Headquarters Air Force Flight Standards Agency, Instrument Procedures Center
manages the Air Force FLIP program, serves as the Air Force representative to the tri-service FLIP
Coordinating Committee (FCC) and its associated subgroups and, as chairman, acts as the coordinating
authority for the FLIP Maintenance Working Groups.
1.2. AFFSA/A3IF. The Aeronautical Information Branch (HQ AFFSA/A3IF) investigates, defines,
consolidates, assembles, validates, prioritizes and lists Air Force operational requirements for FLIP and
Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) items requiring tri-service FCC action.
AFFSA/A3IF is the Air Force point of contact with NGA on FLIP and DAFIF matters for non-
procedural issues. AFFSA/A3IF is also the point of contact to the National Aeronautical Charting
Group (NACG) for NACG aeronautical products. A3IF assumes the responsibility of FLIP account
super-user for those organizations not falling under MAJCOM oversight.
     1.2.1. AFFSA/A3IF carries out the following functions:
        1.2.1.1. Consolidates, validates and coordinates Air Force operational requirements for U.S. and
        International FLIP and digital aeronautical-related requirements. Prioritizes and approves
        recommended FLIP and digital aeronautical changes and requirements and, when necessary,
        coordinates with the Army, Navy, FAA and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
        for FCC action.
        1.2.1.2. Provides technical assistance to MAJCOMs (Major Commands) to assist in fulfilling
        responsibilities supporting subordinate units working within the FLIP distribution process.
        1.2.1.3. Validates and coordinates new or revised FLIP information requirements with the NGA,
        Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Flight Data Center (NFDC), NACG,
        Department of National Defence (Canada) (DND), NavCanada, ICAO, U.S. Army and U.S.
        Navy, as required.
        1.2.1.4. Maintains a list of MAJCOM OPRs for FLIP oversight. A3IF will forward current
        issues to the MAJCOM OPR for dissemination within the MAJCOM.
        1.2.1.5. Processes the Flight Information List (FIL) via the AFFSA FLIP REVISION REPORT
        (AF Form 3546), accessible on the e-publishing website, http://www.e-publishing.af.mil. The
        FIL is a compilation of DoD non-procedural FLIP data received from MAJCOMs, Airfield
        Managers, Airfield Management Operations and aircrew for FLIP changes, additions and
        deletions. The FIL is the official document for the submission of aeronautical data changes
        within DoD and shared FLIP products and is a mandatory, inherent function required to keep
        FLIP accurate and updated for safety of flight.
1.3. All MAJCOMs.         MAJCOMs will identify POCs responsible for monitoring MAJCOM unit
accounts, assisting account holders in acquisition of FLIP, establishment of additional accounts for
deployment and assuming responsibilities of super-user. POC information will be submitted to
AFFSA/A3IF for any changes.
1.4. OCONUS MAJCOMs.            Will designate theater representatives-Caribbean, Central and South
America, European and Pacific-to attend their respective Theater FLIP Maintenance Working Group

                                      ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

4.1. General.
     4.1.1. Flying units are responsible for ordering FLIP products in quantities according to the NGA
     published Catalog of Maps, Charts and Related Products CD-ROM, U.S. Air Force Basis of
     Distribution. The procedures for the establishment and management of a FLIP account are itemized
     in GP Chapter 11.
     4.1.2. Airfield Management. Normally, the Airfield Operations or Airfield Manager assumes
     responsibility for ordering FLIP products for base units. For deployed locations at fixed base
     locations, the Airfield Manager should assume responsibility for FLIP management for all units
     utilizing that location. At bare base airfields, aircrew should bring their own FLIP due to little or no
     support available.
4.2. Ordering FLIP products.
     4.2.1. Non-DoD FLIP Products. Organizations requiring non-DoD FLIP and not utilizing unit
     funding need to submit their requirements through their respective MAJCOM POC who will forward
     to AFFSA/A3IF for validation. Submissions should include mission supported, specific information
     not included in DoD FLIP and justification. Examples would include:
        4.2.1.1. Support of presidential flights.
        4.2.1.2. Support of flights to areas where DoD FLIP coverage does not exist.
        4.2.1.3. Support of urgent operational requirements.
        4.2.1.4. Support to areas where political sensitivity precludes publication in DoD FLIP.
4.3. Use of Non U.S. Government Terminal FLIP products. Approach, departure and arrival FLIP
products not published by the DoD or Department of Transportation (DOT) requires approval IAW AFI
11-202V3, General Flight Rules, Chapter 8.
AFI11-201 31 MARCH 2009                                                                          7
