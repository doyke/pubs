Section A—Program Purpose and Scope

1. Purpose. This publication establishes objectives, responsibilities, procedures, and guidance
for MAJCOM, managers and personnel administrators to assess the effectiveness of NAF
civilian personnel management and administration. It applies to MAJCOM commanders,
installation commanders, Force Support Squadron (FSS) commanders or directors, management
officials, and Chiefs of Human Resources who exercise responsibilities over NAF activities. Its
coverage includes US citizen employee programs located overseas.
2. Assessments.
     2.1. Dual-Track Assessments. In the context of this publication, personnel management
     differs from personnel administration. Although both are interrelated, the effective discharge
     of responsibilities in each area demands a distinction.
        2.1.1. Personnel management refers to the responsibilities and actions of managers and
        supervisors in dealing with their employees. It involves employee selection, basic human
AFMAN34-312 12 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                   3


       relations, and job design aimed at reducing or overcoming job dissatisfaction arising from
       repetitive and mechanistic tasks, work distribution, planning, training, labor relations,
       discipline, and motivational tasks.
       2.1.2. Personnel administration refers to the Chief, Human Resources’ responsibility to
       administer NAF personnel programs, to provide technical advice and guidance to
       managers, and to effectively aid management in the discharge of their personnel
       management tasks. Air Force NAF-Human Resources (HR) Section self-assessments
       focus on the status of administrative and advisory effectiveness.
3. Self-Assessment. An essential element in evaluating the effectiveness of authorities
delegated to managers, supervisors, and Chief, Human Resources at installation level is by self-
assessment of personnel management and administration. The most useful assessment of day-to-
day practices addresses how personnel system requirements help or hinder the mission. These
assessments improve local management and administration, and elevate those issues which
hinder the mission beyond local control to higher levels for resolution.
4. Assessment Objectives. Personnel management and administration assessments are used to
determine the effectiveness of operations, implement corrective measures when necessary, and
plan operational improvements. The assessment system:
   4.1. Evaluates the application of all legal, statutory, and regulatory requirements governing
   NAF civilian personnel administration and employee entitlements.
   4.2. Enhances the personnel management capabilities of managers and supervisors in dealing
   with their employees.
   4.3. Enhances the personnel administration expertise of human resource office specialists to
   ensure regulatory compliance in the discharge of their personnel management tasks.
   4.4. Identifies and eliminates ineffective NAF personnel administration practices, policies,
   and procedures.
   4.5. Measures progress in correcting problems and achieving personnel management goals.

Section C—Assessment Preparation and Measurement

6. Installation Assessments. Installation assessments cover both NAF human resource
management and NAF human resources administration.
   6.1. Personnel management assessments measure the effectiveness of organizational
   management in dealing with their subordinates. They may include the use of on-site
   interviews, local assessment teams, manager and supervisor guides, and personnel data the
   HR Section furnishes.
   6.2. Personnel administration assessments measure the effectiveness of internal HR Section
   operations and the administration of NAF personnel programs.
      6.2.1. These assessments must be conducted at least annually. Use the Air Force Quality
      Assessment Guides from AFPC/SVXH, DCPDS and BO products, and any other records
      reflecting the condition of internal HR Section operations, the condition of NAF
      personnel programs, and the effectiveness of advisory services provided to management
      to conduct the assessment.
      6.2.2. Determine an overall assessment of personnel administration effectiveness. As a
      minimum, if the assessment rates any program element "Not Met", it must include an
      improvement plan; if it rates a program element "Met", it must document such a rating.
7. How to Complete the Ratings.
   7.1. Assess NAF personnel program elements and areas by reference to a common set of
   terms. The program areas in the guides and checklists contained in the Air Force Personnel
   Center Quality Assessment Guide for Human Resources Management and Administration
   located                                                                                at:
   https://www.usafservices.com/Managers/HumanResources/Assessments/tabid/632/Defa
   ult.aspx    cover the major functions and activities of personnel management and
   administration. Assign each area an overall rating assignment according to the guidelines
   below. Program elements are part of a program area addressed by one or more questions in
   the guides. The elements are tasks and responsibilities, goals and accomplishments,
   regulatory compliance, etc. Rate each element separately, based on these guidelines:
      7.1.1. Met (M). Meets all or nearly all program element requirements in an exceptional
      manner. The majority of the elements in a program area are rated “M” and no element is
      rated “Not Met”.
      7.1.2. Partially Met (PM). Meets all or nearly all program element requirements.
      Deficiencies do not impede or limit program accomplishment. The majority of the
      elements in a program area are rated “PM” or better.
      7.1.3. Not Met (NM). Does not meet the majority of program element requirements.
      Deficiencies prevent program accomplishment. The majority of the elements in a
      program area are rated “NM”.
 6                                                        AFMAN34-312 12 FEBRUARY 2014


     7.2. The Human Resources Management and Administration Quality Assessment Rating
     Sheet in the Air Force Quality Assessment Guides lists the program areas and their elements
     to be rated during the assessment. Use it to document results.
        7.2.1. Note that the Chief, Human Resources conducts assessments and determines
        ratings for both personnel management and personnel administration.
        7.2.2. If an entire program area or an individual program element is not applicable at the
        installation, enter "N/A" or "Not Rated" in the rating column.
        7.2.3. Complete an improvement plan to address all elements rated “NM”. As a
        minimum, plans must identify the program element, deficiency, necessary corrective
        action, the action official, and a target date for completion.
        7.2.4. Include documentation for any element assigned "Met" or "Partially Met" ratings.
     7.3. Classification accuracy and regulatory compliance have prescribed percentage
     standards. Round percentages to the next higher whole percent (e.g., 96.1 percent will be 97
     percent). Use Figure 1 to convert to an adjective rating. Base the ratings on the findings of
     a random sample determined by using the sampling table at Attachment 2.

Figure 1. Percentage Conversion Chart
     ADJECTIVE RATING                  CLASSIFICATION                     REGULATORY
                                                                          COMPLIANCE
               Met                         95 – 100%                        90 – 100%
          Partially Met                     90 – 94%                         80 – 89%
            Not Met                       Less than 90%                    Less than 80%
8. Assessment Guides. AFPC/SVXH develops the assessment guides referenced in paragraph
5.5.2, and forwards them to AFPC/SVIRF and FSS Chiefs, Human Resources. Each guide
covers significant NAF personnel management and administration programs and responsibilities.
The guides include questions for use in assessing each element of a program. Negative or
unknown responses indicate a less-than-desirable situation depending on the number and
frequency of responses. Objective use and analysis are critical to success. Use these guides to
conduct assessments.
9. Standards for Measuring Effectiveness.
     9.1. Personnel Management. A "yes" response to an item in the guide will normally indicate
     satisfactory accomplishment of a management task or responsibility. "Yes" answers to all
     items under a program element normally warrant a “Met” rating for the element. An element
     may be rated “Met” with one or more negative responses to sub-element items when the
     deficiencies do not impede or limit accomplishment of the overall task; that is, the objective
     is fully “Met” in spite of the deficiencies. Managerial and supervisory responsibilities for
     program elements are in AFI 34-301, Nonappropriated Fund Personnel Management and
     Administration, which serves as a basis for the guides. Meeting these responsibilities is the
     standard for a satisfactory rating. Use percentage standards only where program
     accomplishments can be quantified to provide a meaningful measurement of program
     effectiveness.
AFMAN34-312 12 FEBRUARY 2014                                                             7


  9.2. Personnel Administration. A "yes" response to the guide items normally indicates
  satisfactory program conditions. Base ratings on a thorough analysis of program
  accomplishments compared to minimum regulatory and directed requirements. To determine
  when conditions are less than minimally acceptable, the HR Section must assess whether
  unmet goals and objectives for their individual deficiencies are sufficient in number and
  scope to pose actual or potential problems for management and installation employees.
  Where practical, the assessment guides establish specific percentage standards.

                 RANDOM SAMPLING INSTRUCTIONS AND TABLES

A2.1. Random sampling is an effective way of rapidly measuring group characteristics with a
high degree of confidence. It saves time and money when compared to total census or individual
product reviews, inspections, or audits. Random sampling uses the probability of chance
selection. To be valid, each member or unit that comprises a whole group, for example, people
in an organization, must have an equal chance of being selected. Draw the size of the
representative random sample using the whole group size. Table A2.1 and Table A2.2, reflect
those relationships for common group categories where random sampling can be used
advantageously.

A2.2. The easiest method is to obtain a whole group listing for sampling a category. Use
DCPDS and BO capabilities for most sampling purposes. Determine the sample size by
referring to Table A2.1, for example, a total group of 400 positions = 12 sample positions. A
sample selection may use a constant interval selection formula.
A2.3. The constant interval method is easy to use, and is considered sufficiently valid for
assessment purposes. When using the example cited above, the constant interval selection
method from the position roster could be every 33rd position (400 divided by 12). Each member
or unit must have the same probability of being selected. Therefore, the selection must be totally
random.

A2.4. The preferred method of sampling personnel actions involves these steps:
   A2.4.1. Determine the type of personnel actions selected for audit, for example, accessions,
   promotions and reassignments, pay adjustments, within grade increases, etc.
   A2.4.2. Obtain a BO name roster grouped by personnel action type for transactions
   occurring over the previous 12-month period.
   A2.4.3. Based on the total number of transactions listed, obtain the sample size from Table
   A2.2
   A2.4.4. Use the constant interval method to select the sample.
   A2.4.5. Obtain the individual official personnel folder (OPF) and complete audit using the
   applicable AF Form 2676, NAF Personnel Action Worksheet No. 1; AF Form 2677, NAF
   Personnel Action Worksheet No. 2; AF Form 2678, NAF Personnel Action Worksheet No. 3;
   and AF Form 2799, NAF Personnel Action Worksheet No. 4.
A2.5. The Random Sample Tables reflect minimum sample sizes sufficient to reflect program
conditions. Ensure the random sample selected includes a proportionate share of Crafts and
Trades (CT), Pay Band (NF), and Child and Youth Programs Employee pay plans. Treat the
sample size for other areas such as appeals, grievances, disciplinary actions, awards, etc., the
same as personnel actions.

                                          Attachment 3
      GUIDE FOR REVIEWING REGULATORY COMPLIANCE OF PERSONNEL
                              ACTIONS

A3.1. Regulatory compliance errors fall in two categories:
   A3.1.1. A violation is a serious error that invalidates the action, affects an employee’s rights,
   establishes an improper salary or wage payment, affects an employee’s retirement or
   insurance coverage or creates a security problem. Each violation which might routinely
   occur in a personnel action is pre-identified and given a weight based on the seriousness and
   impact of the violation. For violations not already identified, assessors are to use the
   following definitions to determine the weight. The Air Force standard requires 97 percent of
   the personnel action compliance items to be free of violations. Weights use a scale of one to
   five. Definitions are:
       A3.1.1.1. Five: The weight for a violation which normally requires extraordinary efforts
       to correct or is not correctable.
       A3.1.1.2. Four: The weight for a violation which is a serious error and is usually
       correctable.
       A3.1.1.3. Three: The weight for a violation which is a serious error but is relatively easy
       to correct.
       A3.1.1.4. Two: The weight for a violation which is not serious and is easy to correct.
       A3.1.1.5. One: The weight for a violation which does not adversely affect employee
       entitlements or a program condition, yet it still violates a law, regulation or instruction.
   A3.1.2. A discrepancy is an error of lesser consequence than a violation. It is attributable to
   improper or nonapplication of procedures, record keeping deficiencies, misfiling, etc.
A3.2. The accuracy rate is determined as follows:
   A3.2.1. Violations:
       A3.2.1.1. Determine the violation rate as follows:
          A3.2.1.1.1. Step 1: Identify in a spreadsheet column the total number of personnel
          actions by the nature of action (NOA).
          A3.2.1.1.2. Step 2: Using Table A3.1 through Table A3.5, determine the total
          possible number of violations for each NOA identified in Step 1.
          A3.2.1.1.3. Step 3: Multiply the total possible violations (Step 2) by the number of
          personnel actions by NOA (Step 1). Then, add the products. This becomes the total
          possible violations for sample I.
          A3.2.1.1.4. Step 4: Identify each violation and its weight. (Note: If a record has
          more than one violation, count each violation.) Add all weights for the total violation
          weight.
          A3.2.1.1.5. Step 5: Subtract the total weighted violations from the total possible
          violations. This becomes the adjusted total.
AFMAN34-312 12 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                 13


          A3.2.1.1.6. Step 6: Divide the adjusted total by the total possible violations. This
          becomes the violation rate.

Total Possible Violations in Sample: 213
Total Weight of Sample Violations: -12 (minus twelve total violation weights)
Adjusted Total: 201
201/213 = 94.4 Percent - Violation Rate
   A3.2.2. Discrepancies:
       A3.2.2.1. Step 1: Identify in a spreadsheet column the number of OPFs reviewed for
       regulatory compliance.
       A3.2.2.2. Step 2: Using table A3.6., determine the total number of discrepancies for
       each OPF.
       A3.2.2.3. Step 3: Divide the total number of discrepancies by the total number of OPFs
       reviewed to determine the average number of discrepancies per OPF.
       A3.2.2.4. Step 4: Determine the discrepancy impact outlined in Figure A3.2.

Figure A3.2. Discrepancy Impact
Average Number of Discrepancies                 Discrepancy Impact

4.6 - Above                                     -1.5
       A3.2.2.5. Step 5: Add or subtract, as appropriate, the discrepancy impact from the
       violation rate computed per paragraph A3.2.1.1.6. This becomes the combined violation
       and discrepancy rate.
       A3.2.2.6. Step 6: Determine the adjective rating by reference to paragraph 5.3.3., Figure
       1.

A3.3. Installations will conduct self-assessments periodically to determine the regulatory
compliance accuracy rates. Draw a random sampling of actions processed over a given period
according to instructions in attachment 2. Using the proper Personnel Action Worksheets, check
off compliance items as documentation is reviewed and found to be correct. Identify errors by
an "X" and mark nonapplicable items "N/A". Correct errors but leave the "X’s" on the
worksheets to ease computation of accuracy rates and trend analyses.
A3.4. The regulatory compliance sample will include the following Nature of Action Codes
(NOAC):

             GUIDE FOR DETERMINING CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY

A4.1. A classification error is one that invalidates an action, affects an employee’s rights, or
establishes an improper salary or wage payment. Each error which might routinely occur in the
classification process is pre-identified and given a weight based on the seriousness and impact of
the error. Errors are weighted on a scale from one to four. The Air Force standard requires 95
percent accuracy rate in position classification. Definitions are:
   A4.1.1. Four: The weight for an error in classification which results in a position being
   either over graded or under graded.
   A4.1.2. Three: The weight for an error in classification which results in a position being
   placed in an improper occupational series.
   A4.1.3. Two: The weight for an error in classification which results in a position being
   improperly titled.
   A4.1.4. One: The weight for an error in classification which results in the duties in the
   position guide or position description (PG/PD) not being reflected accurately. Correction of
   the duties will not affect the grade, occupational series or title of the position.
A4.2. The accuracy rate is determined as follows:
   A4.2.1. Step 1: Identify in a spreadsheet column the total number of positions audited for
   classification accuracy.
   A4.2.2. Step 2: Assign a maximum possible error weight of four to each position audited.
   A4.2.3. Step 3: Multiply the maximum possible weight (four) by the number of positions
   audited. This becomes the total possible error weight for Sample I.
   A4.2.4. Step 4: Identify each error found in the position audits, and its weight. Add all
   weights for the total error weight.
   A4.2.5. Step 5: Subtract the total error weight from the total possible error weight. This
   becomes the adjusted total.
   A4.2.6. Step 6: Divide the adjusted total by the total possible error weight. This becomes
   the classification error rate.
   A4.2.7. Step 7: Determine the adjective rating by reference to paragraph 5.3.3, figure 1.
