This instruction implements requirements of AFI 36-802, Pay Setting, and establishes policies
and procedures for the request and approval of civilian overtime and compensatory time at F. E.
Warren AFB (FEW). Overtime payment will be in accordance with pertinent statutes, applicable
decision of the Comptroller General, Department of Defense, and Air Force policies. It applies
to all units assigned or attached to FEW. This publication does not apply to Air Force Reserve
Command Units or Air National Guard. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Comply with AFI 33-332 Air Force Privacy

1. General: Overtime and compensatory time should be approved in writing and in advance,
whenever possible. Overtime should be utilized for urgent and unexpected workload surges,
 2                                                             90MWI36-802 23 MARCH 2012


such as when unusual, occasional, or seasonal workload must be accomplished within a given
time period and additional personnel are not available, or when performance of overtime work is
more economical than hiring temporary employees or paying for charges or damages that would
otherwise be incurred. Compensatory time is time off in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or
occasional overtime work. Compensatory time off for travel is a separate form of compensatory
time off that may be earned by an employee for time spent in a travel status away from the
employee's official duty station.
2. Policies:
     2.1. It is mandatory for all Appropriated Funds (APF) civilians, certifiers, supervisors, and
     commanders to complete a computer based training. (Procedures clarified in paragraph 4.)
     This computer based training provides a step-by-step description of the civilian overtime
     request and approval process.
     2.2. All employees who complete their timecards through the Electronic Management
     Tracking System (eMTS) must complete the AF Form 428, Request for Overtime, Holiday
     Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time through eMTS as well. If the employee does not
     normally input their timecard electronically through eMTS, they must do a hard copy AF
     Form 428.
     2.3. The AF Form 428 must be completed and approved before the time is worked.
     (Reference AFI 36-802, para 3.1.2) EXCEPTION: In an emergency, the supervisor may
     order overtime without authorization but must document the overtime no later than the
     following workday on the AF Form 428.
        2.3.1. The AF Form 428 in eMTS must be approved before timecards are processed on
        Friday morning.
        2.3.2. The “Justification” block on the AF Form 428 must contain a statement that is
        both clear and specific before approval from the supervisor. A justification must answer
        the question, “Why could work not be completed during normal work hours?”
        Unacceptable justifications include but are not limited to, “Worked in Building 1248” or
        “Finished up work.” A general definition of overtime is defined in paragraph 1.
     2.4. According to AFI 36-802, paragraph 3.1.1, it is mandatory for commanders to ensure
     that overtime work occurs only pursuant to mission needs.
        2.4.1. Commanders must review all overtime requested versus overtime taken on a
        quarterly basis.
        2.4.2. Reports will be sent to each timekeeper by the base level customer service
        representative for commanders’ review.
     2.5. If the employee has their timecard input in the Defense Civilian Payroll System or
     another system other than eMTS, the AF Form 428 must be maintained for six years.
3. Blanket AF Form 428. A unit may only use blanket AF Forms 428 when approved by the
base level Customer Service Representative. The blanket AF Form 428 will be completed
similar to an individual’s AF Form 428. The only difference between a blanket and individual
form will be the projected approval period. The max timeframe a “blanket” AF Form 428 may
be approved is two pay periods. The timekeepers must review all blanket AF Forms 428 to
90MWI36-802 23 MARCH 2012                                                                  3


ensure compliance. A corrected AF Form 428 must be completed after the blanket AF Form 428
expires to show actual amount of overtime/compensatory time worked.
4. Procedures:
   4.1. All users must take a step-by-step AF Form 428 training. The website for the training
   may be found at this address: https://eis.afspc.af.mil/unit/hq/FM/eMTS/default.aspx.
      4.1.1. Members must take the “Leave and Overtime – Captioned” computer based
      training.
      4.1.2. Choose “Overtime Requests” and watch the video through the “Audit” phase.
   4.2. When completed, each member must notify their timekeeper that they completed the
   aforementioned training.
   4.3. New employees are required to complete the training within 30 days of assumption of
   duties.
