                 VANDENBERG AIRFIELD AND AREA DESCRIPTION

2.1. Location.
   2.1.1. Vandenberg AFB is located adjacent to Lompoc California, at N 34 44.24’ and W120
   35.06’. The airport identifier is KVBG. The field elevation is 369’ MSL. Runway 30
   threshold elevation is 369’ MSL. Runway 12 threshold elevation is 237’ MSL.
2.2. Airfield Operations and Air Traffic Control Facilities.
   2.2.1. The Air Traffic Control facilities at Vandenberg AFB consists of a Visual Flight Rules
   (VFR) Tower. The Tower, Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS) and Transient
   Aircraft Maintenance Aerospace Ground Equipment (TAMAGE) shall operate during
   published airfield hours (0800L to 1700L, Monday through Friday), unless otherwise
   published in a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). The facilities are closed weekends and holidays.
   After-hour operations are approved on an individual basis by the 30 OSS/CC.
   2.2.2. The Weather Operations Center and AMOPS are not collocated. A direct line is
   provided in the AMOPS mission planning room for access to the duty forecaster. A
   representative observation site (ROS) is located at Bldg 1764; observations are taken during
   normal airfield operating hours and when the airfield is open for after-hour operations (by
   request). Terminal forecasts are issued 24 hours a day and amended during hours when
   official observations are taken (e.g. when the airfield is open). During hours when no official
   observations are taken, the forecasts will have the remark ―LIMITED MET WATCH‖
   appended to it. These forecasts will only be amended for weather warning criteria at the
   airfield. Pilot to Metro Service (PMSV) may provide useful planning information concerning
   the forecast and current weather trends. All other weather services, except NOTAMs, are
   available from PMSV. See the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Supplement for details.
   2.2.3. Frontier Control’s normal operating hours are 0745L to 1545L, Monday through
   Friday. Frontier Control is closed weekends and holidays. During launch operations,
   Frontier Control provides guidance to support aircraft for hazard area surveillance and aerial
   photographic staging; provides precision vectoring to instrumentation support aircraft; directs
   airborne launch platforms to the launch point; and also supports any other airborne asset to
   meet the needs of the range user. On a daily basis, Frontier Control supports aeronautical
   operations. The Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB utilizes Western Range assets
   (radar, telemetry, ground control, etc.) to conduct low-level and high-altitude flight tests in
   the airspace offshore VAFB. Other programs include training support for air defense fighter
   aircraft from Air Combat Command and the US Navy.
2.3. Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) Procedures.
   2.3.1. The Tower will broadcast ATIS messages anytime the facility is operational IAW
   FAA JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control. During other hours, a message indicating the airfield
   is closed will be broadcasted. Additional information may be included as deemed necessary
   by ATC.
2.4. Navigation Aids (NAVAIDs). The following terminal NAVAIDs are available:
 12                                                             30SWI13-201 31 OCTOBER 2011


   2.4.1. TACAN--Channel 59Y, Identifier-VBG (USAF operated and maintained, monitored
   by the Tower, and equipped with emergency generator power).
   2.4.2. ILS (USAF operated and maintained, monitored by the Tower, and equipped with
   internal monitors and emergency generator power).
NOTE: All NAVAIDS, ASOS, and FMQ-13 systems are provided back-up power initially from
the airfield lighting vault generator. In the event the lighting vault generator fails, the individual
generators provide power where installed.
   2.4.3. RWY 12--Frequency: 110.1 Identifier: I-BVD
   2.4.4. RWY 30--Frequency: 110.1 Identifier: I-VBG
   2.4.5. Preventative Maintenance Inspection (PMI) Schedule. Scheduled (No-NOTAM) PMI
   for the TACAN is Mondays, 0600-0800L. Scheduled (No-NOTAM) PMI for the ILS
   systems is Tuesday- Friday, 0600-0800L.
2.5. ATCALS and Auxiliary Power Operation. ATC services must continue during severe
weather or other power outages. The following procedures apply to ensure that continuous
power is supplied to ATC facilities and NAVAIDs:
   2.5.1. All Vandenberg ATCALS facilities will operate on commercial power as long as
   commercial power is reliable. If the auto-start capability for any ATCALS equipment is
   determined to be inoperative, Power Production shall notify the Tower and the ATCALS
   facility will be placed on back-up power 30 minutes prior to the observed or forecast arrival
   of severe weather. For the purpose of this requirement, severe weather is defined as
   thunderstorms or lightning within 10 NM of the airport as reported by the base weather
   station or observed by the Tower. The Tower Watch Supervisor and AMOPS must be
   notified by maintenance personnel prior to any planned power outages or when transferring
   to generator.
   2.5.2. All ATCALS placed on generator power will remain on generator until the severe
   weather advisory has been terminated by the base weather station.

   support prior to requesting approval. Mission impact and ability to support recommendation
   shall be included with request.
   2.7.3. If after-hour support request is approved, AMOPS will execute applicable Quick
   Reaction Checklist (QRC) and coordinate support effort.
   2.7.4. Procedures.
      2.7.4.1. Transient aircraft will be supported by a controlled (open) airfield. A transient
      aircraft is defined as any aircraft other than those locally assigned to Vandenberg
      agencies. As a minimum, the Tower, a weather forecaster and observer, AMOPS, and
      Transient Aircraft Maintenance shall be scheduled to support. All personnel will report
      one hour prior to the scheduled aerodrome opening. The aerodrome will open 30 minutes
      prior to scheduled arrivals and departures.
      2.7.4.2. The aircraft scheduler, manager, or pilot must contact AMOPS and identify the
      need or potential need for extended operating hours as early as possible. Requests should
      be received at least 24 hours in advance to coordinate support. Call AMOPS (DSN 276-
      6941) during airfield operating hours. After airfield operating hours, call the Vandenberg
      Command Post (CP) (DSN 276-9961). The 30 SW/CP shall relay all information to
      AMOPS personnel.
      2.7.4.3. Requestor shall communicate any changes to arrival time through Vandenberg
      Command Post (DSN 276-9961). NOTAM shall reflect airfield hours based on after
      hours request and direct aircrew to contact Command Post (Space Port) 30 minutes out or
      earlier on frequencies VHF 126.2 or UHF 311.0 or 321.0.
      2.7.4.4. If reimbursement of services is required, the POC shall provide an AF Form 185
      and project work order. Fund site or Job Order Number (JON) information may also be
      required. All accounting or payment requirements shall be coordinated through the 30th
      Comptroller Squadron (30 CPTS/FMA, DSN 276-5962) or the 30th Contracting
      Squadron (30 CONS/LGC, DSN 275-0496).

   2.8.1. Local Flying and VFR Local Training Areas. VFR local training areas are any areas,
   routes, or airports within a 150 NM radius of the VBG TACAN which are used to conduct
   operations and training. The local flying areas are designated as the portion of Central
   California, bordered on the south by a straight line starting at Monterey, northeast to Lee
   Vining Airport (Mono Lake), northwest to the northern tip of Eagle Lake, west to Eureka,
   south to Point Arena, and southeast to the point of origin (See Attachments 10, 11 and 12).
NOTE: Full stop landings at airports other than VBG followed by a return to VBG are not
considered a VFR local flight plan.
   2.8.2. Adjacent Airports. There are civil airports with numerous general aviation aircraft
   operating VFR and IFR at various altitudes near Vandenberg AFB (See Attachment 11). The
   following list gives the names, identifier, locations of the airports (From Vandenberg
   TACAN, VBG), and type of air traffic to expect. Pilots should use caution while operating
   within the vicinity of Vandenberg AFB; civil traffic may not be in contact with Tower.
       2.8.2.1. Santa Maria Airport (SMX). Located at 013R/12 DME; VFR and light IFR
       traffic serving commercial passengers.
       2.8.2.2. Santa Barbara Metro Airport (SBA).       Located at 100R/41 DME; medium
       VFR/IFR traffic serving commercial passengers.
       2.8.2.3. Lompoc Airport (LPC). Located at 110R/06DME; general aviation airport,
       serving primarily small, personal aircraft, helicopters and some small business jets. The
       208-acre airport is not equipped to serve commercial passengers like the Santa Maria and
       Santa Barbara airports, but does operate a parachute jump school. Jump operations are
       typically conducted over the field at or below 13,000’.
       2.8.2.4. San Luis Obispo Airport (SBP). Located at 338R/30DME; VFR and light IFR
       traffic serving commercial passengers.

       serving primarily small, personal aircraft, helicopters some small business /experimental
       jets and gliders.
2.9. Air Traffic Control Facilities.
   2.9.1. Santa Barbara Approach Control (SBA Approach) is Vandenberg’s terminal radar
   facility from 0600L-2300L, Monday through Sunday, and is responsible for controlling IFR
   traffic and basic radar services to VFR aircraft within the local flying area.
   2.9.2. Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZLA ARTCC) will provide approach
   control services in the event Vandenberg’s airfield is open outside SBA’s operating hours.
   2.9.3. Vandenberg Tower is responsible for VFR operations within the Class D airspace.
2.10. Tie-In Flight Service Station (FSS) for Vandenberg AFB. The FAA’s Hawthorne
Automated FSS provides this service 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
   2.10.1. AMOPS enters all outbound flight information into the Aeronautical Information
   System Replacement (AISR). AMOPS flight follows inbound flights during operating hours.
   Before closing each day, AMOPS transfers flight following responsibility to the FAA Flight
   Service Station (FSS).
30SWI13-201 31 OCTOBER 2011                                                                     15


   2.10.2. Flight following by any agency other than AMOPS or an FAA agency does not
   guarantee automatic initiation of search and rescue, should it be required. If a local flight
   being followed by its parent unit becomes overdue, the parent unit must contact FAA FSS to
   start search and rescue. If such an aircraft becomes overdue, AMOPS will initiate procedures
   as outlined in AFJM 11-213, Military Flight Data Telecommunications System.
2.11. Controlled Airspace and Restricted/Warning Areas.
   2.11.1. General.
      2.11.1.1. R-2516 and R-2517 are continuous use restricted areas. Frontier Control,
      located on Vandenberg AFB, is the controlling agency for these restricted areas. R-2517
      is closed continuously to all air traffic, except aircraft under Tower control conducting
      operations within the Vandenberg Class D airspace, any aircraft supporting an approved
      range operation, and aircraft authorized by Frontier Control on a case-by-case basis. Use
      of R-2516, which contains the airfield, is granted to air traffic control (Vandenberg
      Tower, SBA Approach and ZLA ARTCC) by the using agency for the purpose of
      conducting flight and airfield operations. Joint-use restricted areas R-2534A and R-
      2534B also affect the local flying area. Over-water flights may be affected by activation
      of intermittent warning areas W-532 and W-537. FLIP AP/1A and enroute charts
      describe these areas in detail.
   2.11.2. Tower will:
      2.11.2.1. Provide ATC services within Vandenberg Class D airspace.
      2.11.2.2. Maintain current status of R-2516 and R-2517.
      2.11.2.3. Verify airspace assignment at the start of each duty day with Frontier Control.
      2.11.2.4. Vacate the airspace of all transient aircraft and relinquish control of Class D
      airspace to Frontier Control within 15 minutes of recall.
   2.11.3. Frontier Control will:
      2.11.3.1. Notify Tower as soon as possible, but not less than one hour prior, of any
      launch or other scheduled test operations that may affect ATC operations. For short
      notice or unscheduled operations, the airspace can be closed with 15 minutes notice.
      2.11.3.2. Provide Tower by direct line on a daily basis, scheduled airspace assignments
      and operating times of R-2516 and R-2517 for the ensuing 24 hour period.
      2.11.3.3. Grant approval, as the situation permits, for aircraft to transit areas under their
      control upon request by Tower.
      2.11.3.4. Obtain approval from Tower prior to authorizing aircraft to transit through
      areas released to Tower.
   2.11.4. Access Procedures.
      2.11.4.1. To enter, depart, or operate in R-2516 for the purpose of conducting airfield
      operations when the Tower is open, pilots must have an active IFR or VFR flight plan on
      file and clearance from the Tower.
 16                                                         30SWI13-201 31 OCTOBER 2011


       2.11.4.2. When Tower is closed, aircraft may not land, takeoff, or operate on
       Vandenberg’s airfield.
       2.11.4.3. To conduct a full stop landing, takeoff, or operate on Vandenberg's airfield,
       pilots must have clearance from the Tower. Clearance for full stop or departing aircraft is
       based on notification from AMOPS of a valid flight plan on file which comes through the
       Aeronautical Information System (AIS). An automated flight progress strip from the
       Tower's Flight Data Input Output (FDIO) equipment must be verified with AMOPS for
       full stop and departing aircraft.
NOTE: This does not apply to transient aircraft conducting practice approaches that will not full
stop land and receive airfield services.
       2.11.4.4. Contractor or other civilian aircraft intending to land at Vandenberg must have
       on board the aircraft a valid civil aircraft landing permit issued IAW AFI 10-1001, Civil
       Aircraft Landing Permits. Conditions of the permit require the contractor or other
       civilian user to contact AMOPS at least 24 hours prior to planned landing to confirm
       permission to land.
       2.11.4.5. Civilian aircraft transition of R-2516 is authorized only for aircraft in contact
       with Tower, Frontier Control, SBA Approach or ZLA ARTCC. Civilian aircraft may
       perform transition work at the Vandenberg airfield only during airfield operating hours.
       Civilian transition operations are restricted to low approaches only. The Tower may
       withdraw approval for transition work when traffic situations dictate.
2.12. Vandenberg Class D Airspace.
   2.12.1. That airspace from the surface to 2,900 ft MSL within a 4.3 NM radius of the airport
   (N34o 43.47’ W120o 34.37’) within R-2516 and R-2517 (See Attachment 11).
   2.12.2. During the hours that the Tower is operational, Tower is authorized to conduct
   aircraft operations within the Class D airspace without prior coordination with Frontier
   Control.
   2.12.3. When controlling operations within the Class D airspace, Tower will instruct aircraft
   to avoid over-flying the area between the VBG R-155 and R-185 beyond a 3.5 NM radius
   from the TACAN and to remain north of the railroad spur line on the south side of the Santa
   Ynez River.
       2.12.3.1. These restrictions ensure avoidance of the TPQ-18 radar exclusion area (R-
       164/4 DME) and the Hypergolic Fuels Storage Facility (R-174/3.6 DME). Aircraft
       overflight requests will be coordinated on a case-by-case basis.
       2.12.3.2. Vandenberg Class D airspace reverts to Class E when the Tower is closed.
2.13. Airfield Description. NOTE: Information concerning maximum gross weight allowed
per aircraft type and landing gear configuration is located in Tab C-5 of the Base Comprehensive
Plan and is published in appropriate Flight Information Publication (FLIP) documents.
Additional information is available from the Airfield Manager (AFM) or Civil Engineering
Pavements Engineer.
   2.13.1. The airfield elevation is 369 feet (ft) mean sea level (MSL).

   2.13.2. The runway (RWY 12/30) is 15,000 ft long and 200 ft wide. From the approach end
   of RWY 30, the runway has a downward gradient of 0.9%. The entire runway is grooved
   (See Attachment 2).
   2.13.3. The parallel Taxiway (Taxiway), Taxiway A, and portion of Taxiway D between the
   runway and Taxiway A, are 75 ft wide (concrete) with 50 ft stabilized asphalt shoulders on
   each side. Taxiways B, C and the portion of Taxiway D between Taxiway A and the aircraft
   parking ramp are 75 ft wide (concrete) with 25 ft stabilized asphalt shoulders on each side.
   2.13.4. Emergency bypass roads are available to circumnavigate an aircraft parked on the
   Orbital Sciences pad on Taxiway A. These asphalt roads are 925 ft long and 14 ft wide, and
   delineated by white lines and amber edge lights. This bypass road is only for small vehicle
   traffic.
2.14. Aircraft Maneuvering Areas.
   2.14.1. A 200 ft radius turnaround is provided at the approach end of RWY 12 to assist
   aircraft in maneuvering for RWY 12 departures. There is insufficient space in this area for
   any aircraft to hold while another aircraft simultaneously departs or lands.
   2.14.2. A hammerhead approximately 575 ft long by 200 ft wide (at its widest point) is
   located at the approach end of RWY 30, on Taxiway A.
   2.14.3. Runway 12 full-runway departure. Aircraft which cannot accept an intersection
   departure are required to back-taxi and may experience departure delays.
   2.14.4. Airfield Controlled Area (ACA). The ACA is defined as that area surrounding the
   runway, bordered by the electrobraid fence up to the Aero Club hangar (Building 1755).
   2.14.5. Controlled Movement Area (CMA). The CMA includes the runway, runway
   overruns, area within 100 ft of the runway and runway overruns, all taxiways, grassy areas
   enclosed by the runway and/or taxiways, and the Instrument Landing System (ILS) Critical
   Areas and Precision Obstacle Free Zones (POFZ) (See Attachments 7, 8, and 9). CMA hold
   lines are located at the intersections of TWYs B, C, and D with TWY A. They are a single
   unbroken line; alternating yellow and black, painted across the taxiway, flanked by signs
   directing you to contact the Tower (See Attachment 3). The Tower shall issue specific
   instructions by two-way radio to control the movement of aircraft, vehicles, equipment, or
   personnel in the CMA. In the event two-way radio communications fail, the tower will
   control vehicular movements with standard light signals.
   2.14.6. The airfield includes the CMA, the aircraft parking ramp (including old Aero Club
   ramp), and Airfield Road. There are four primary airfield gates used to access the airfield
   CMA.
      2.14.6.1. To operate a vehicle in this area, a vehicle operator must be trained,
      appropriately licensed, and use access procedures IAW 30 SWI 13-204, Airfield Driving.
      AMOPS personnel will deny access to the airfield for personnel who do not meet these
      requirements. Contact the Deputy Airfield Manager (DAFM) (DSN 276-6941) to
      schedule training. Wing walkers will be used for aircraft taxiing/towing in and out of the
      apron on the North side of the hanger (Building 1735). The apron is limited to C20
      aircraft and smaller. Aircrews will obtain approval from the AMOPS and Transient
      Aircraft Maintenance prior to operating on the apron.
 18                                                        30SWI13-201 31 OCTOBER 2011


       2.14.6.2. The AFM, in coordination with 30 OSS/OSA, may adjust the boundaries of the
       CMA based on the requirements of a specific event or operation. To operate a vehicle in
       this area, a vehicle operator must be trained and appropriately licensed.
       2.14.6.3. Wing walkers shall be used for aircraft taxiing/towing in and out of the apron
       on the North side of Hangar (Bldg 1735). The apron is limited to C20 aircraft and
       smaller. Aircrews will obtain approval from the AMOPS and Transient Airfield
       Maintenance prior to operating on the apron.
2.15. Vehicle/Pedestrian Operations on Airfield. All vehicle and pedestrian operations on the
ACA, airfield, and CMA shall be conducted IAW this instruction and 30 SWI 13-204, Volume 3,
Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs.
   2.15.1. CMA Control Procedures When Airfield is Open. Tower controls and directs all
   ground traffic and vehicles in the CMA. To achieve this control, the following must be
   obeyed.
   2.15.2. No one may proceed into the CMA (including NAVAID critical areas and ILS/POFZ
   areas) without establishing and maintaining two-way radio communications with, and
   approval from the Tower. All vehicle operators must possess a valid AF Form 483,
   Certificate of Competency and fully understand airfield signs and markings. Vehicle
   operators must provide their own radios; however, AMOPS may loan a radio if one is
   available.
NOTE: Tower light-gun signals will not be used as a substitute for the two-way radio
requirement except in emergency situations such as radio failure.
   2.15.3. Use the Tower, Fire, and Security Forces FM Nets, or Ground Control frequencies
   (275.8/121.75) to communicate with Tower. Tower does not continuously monitor the
   Security Forces or Crash FM Nets. Security Forces and Fire Department vehicle operators
   who require communications with Tower on these frequencies must coordinate through
   Security Forces Control Center (SFCC) and Fire Dispatch to have them notify Tower of the
   request. SFCC, Fire Dispatch, or the vehicle operator(s) will inform the Tower when
   communication is no longer required.
   2.15.4. Vehicle operators on the CMA (including critical areas and ILS/POFZ areas) prior to
   the airfield opening will notify Tower of their position via radio call not later than (NLT)
   0755L (or five minutes prior to airfield opening, if other than regularly scheduled). If radio
   contact cannot be established, the vehicle operator will exit the CMA, ensuring all personnel
   and vehicles are clear NLT 0800L (or such time as the airfield opens, if other than regularly
   scheduled). Failure to either notify Tower or exit the CMA will be documented as a CMA
   violation or runway intrusion, as the situation dictates.
       2.15.4.1. DO NOT cross a runway hold line without explicit permission from the Tower.
       2.15.4.2. Tower approval to cross the runway is a one-time approval only. Once your
       vehicle has exited the runway beyond the runway hold line, Tower approval is required to
       re-enter or cross the runway.
       2.15.4.3. Repeat instructions back to the Tower verbatim.
       2.15.4.4. Report departing the CMA.
30SWI13-201 31 OCTOBER 2011                                                                     19


       2.15.4.5. If you are operating a vehicle on the runway or runway overrun and Tower
       directs you to exit the runway, exit the runway at any of the Taxiway intersections with
       the runway or position yourself at least 100 ft from the edge of the runway or runway
       overrun. As a guide, the runway distance remaining markers (large black signs with large
       white numbers), located in the grass on both sides of the runway, are approximately 75 ft
       from the runway edge.
       2.15.4.6. If radio communication with the Tower is lost:
          2.15.4.6.1. On the runway. If the Tower loses radio contact as a result of radio
          failure, Tower will signal for vehicles to exit the runway by turning the runway lights
          on and off or ATC light gun signals until all vehicles have exited the runway.
          Vehicles should be alert for these signals at all times. Exit the runway and then report
          to AMOPS. Remain vigilant for aircraft, do not reenter or cross the runway. As a last
          resort, continue to drive along the runway until you reach a Taxiway or access road
          that leaves the runway area. If you make it to an access road, depart the runway and
          contact AMOPS as soon as possible.
   2.15.5. Vehicle and Pedestrian Operations When Airfield is Closed. During after duty hours
   and when the Tower or AMOPS are not operational, vehicles and/or pedestrians must contact
   the Vandenberg Command Post prior to and after driving on the airfield. Personnel
   authorized to drive on runways and Taxiways must fully understand airfield signs and
   markings. All vehicle and pedestrian operations on the airfield when the airfield is closed
   shall be conducted IAW this instruction and specific procedures in 30 SWI 13-204, Airfield
   Driving.
2.16. Airfield Lighting Systems.
   2.16.1. The runway is equipped with High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRL), Precision
   Approach Path Indicators (PAPI) (both ends), High Intensity Approach Lighting System
   Category I with sequenced Flashers (ALSF-2) (both ends), and threshold lights (both ends).
2.17. Contingency Control of Airfield Lighting.
   2.17.1. In the event that the airfield lighting or Tower lighting panel fail:
       2.17.1.1. Tower shall advise AMOPS of the outage and provide lighting requirements.
       2.17.1.2. AMOPS shall immediately advise civil engineering airfield lighting personnel
       of lighting outage, and post applicable NOTAM.
2.18. Airfield Lighting Inspections and Maintenance.
   2.18.1. Civil engineer airfield lighting crews will complete all routine daily airfield lighting
   inspections and maintenance as soon as practical each day. Airfield lighting crews shall
   acquire a list of current outages from AMOPS prior to conducting their daily routine
   maintenance.
   2.18.2. Airfield lighting crews can complete emergency repairs at any time with the
   concurrence of the AMOPS supervisor and Tower Watch Supervisor (WS).
   2.18.3. The 30th Civil Engineering (CE) Squadron is responsible for airfield lighting if the
   Tower closes. The AMOPS Operations Supervisor (AMOS) will notify airfield lighting shop
 20                                                          30SWI13-201 31 OCTOBER 2011


   to take control of airfield lights in the event the Tower is closed or the lighting control panel
   becomes inoperative.
      2.18.3.1. The 30th Civil Engineer Production Management Unit (PMU) at 606-
      0010/Customer Service operates Monday – Friday from 0700 – 1545. After duty hour
      emergency service calls will be reported to the 30 CES Damage Control Center (DCC)
      (DSN 276-1856).
   2.18.4. The AFM will ensure:
      2.18.4.1. AMOPS personnel conduct a lighting check once per day. Annotate the results
      of this check on the airfield lighting check form. A copy of the airfield lighting check
      form will be provided to CE Exterior Electric. Notify the Tower of airfield lighting
      outages.
      2.18.4.2. Communications Squadron, Airfield Systems office is notified of any
      obstruction light outages associated with meteorological and navigational equipment.
      2.18.4.3. AMOPS personnel will conduct a lighting check during the hours of darkness
      at least once per month or any time an after duty hour operation allows.
      2.18.4.4. AMOPS tracks all lighting discrepancies and coordinates repairs.
   2.18.5. The CES/CEO Electric Shop will ensure:
      2.18.5.1. Airfield lighting check form is obtained from the AMOPS.
      2.18.5.2. Airfield lighting system inspections are conducted twice a week to ensure
      system reliability.
   2.18.6. AMOPS is notified of status of lighting outages (repairs, awaiting parts, etc) and
   completion of lighting inspection.
   2.18.7. When there is a failure of approach lighting, Tower shall advise pilots of the
   approach light outage and no approach lighting minimums are in effect.
   2.18.8. When runway markings are obscured, approach light out minimums will apply.
   2.18.9. When the Tower is operational, Tower personnel operate all airfield lighting IAW
   FAA JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control. Before closing the Tower, Tower personnel will
   ensure the airfield lighting panel is turned to the automatic-on setting. (During airfield
   inspections conducted before the opening of the Tower, AMOPS personnel may turn on and
   check all airfield lights by using the pilot controlled lighting feature). Tower is not
   responsible for the operation of the airfield lighting system when the airfield is closed.
   2.18.10. When Tower is closed, emergency aircraft requiring airfield lighting may activate
   the lights by keying a transmitter 3 times in quick succession on the VHF Local Control
   frequency (124.95 MHz). This will turn on the runway, Taxiway, approach, PAPI, and
   sequenced flashing lights (SFL). The runway, approach, and PAPI lights can be increased to
   medium intensity by keying the transmitter 5 times and to high intensity by keying the
   transmitter 7 times. The airfield lighting will turn off automatically after 15 minutes.
2.19. Airfield Sweeper Operations.
30SWI13-201 31 OCTOBER 2011                                                                  21

      2.19.1.5. Friday - Flight line Road and access gates 1, 2, 3 and 4.
   2.19.2. The AFM and/or AMOPs personnel will brief the sweeper of other areas needing to
   be swept each morning upon check in. After AMOPS personnel have completed their
   morning inspection/check, the above weekly schedule will b e swept as needed (except both
   overruns, Tow Road, Taxiway Delta, Bravo and Charlie access gates 1, 2, 3 and 4 will be
   swept regardless).
   2.19.3. If an emergency occurs and the sweeper is needed, AMOPs will notify the
   Horizontal Shop at 606-6165. The sweeper will arrive within one half hour after being
   notified. If there is no answer at the Horizontal shop, or it's after duty hours, then AMOPs
   will contact the Disaster Control Center (DCC) at 276-1856 to have a sweeper dispatched.
   2.19.4. Sweeper is available on all weekends, down days and holidays on a 30 minute
   standby basis and can be requested via the DCC. Any questions or concerns can contact the
   Chief, Horizontal Construction.
2.20. Airfield Mowing Operations.
   2.20.1. Areas around Taxiways and runways will be mowed to a height of 7 to 14 inches.
   AMOPS will coordinate specific requirements with 30 CES/CEOSS via submission of an AF
   FORM 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request.
   2.20.2. Contract mowing operations are conducted on an as-required basis.
   2.20.3. Mower operators will check in with AMOPS before and after mowing activities for
   the day.
   2.20.4. AMOPS will issue a radio to the mowers. Mowers will maintain radio contact with
   the Tower at all times when mowing on the airfield. Radio contact with Tower is not
   required for mowing in other areas.
2.21. Emergency Generator Systems.
   2.21.1. All airfield operations personnel assigned shall be trained and documented to
   manually start and operate back-up generator systems. The Tower Controllers, Airfield
   Operations personnel, Facility Manager, and Staff personnel will be fully trained to manually
   restart generator systems located in facility 1748 when automatic generator systems fail to
   function during an unscheduled power outage. Training will be conducted and records
   maintained by the 30 CES.
   2.21.2. The 30 CES/CEO and CEOF will participate in meetings or inspections with the
   AFM/Representative/Facility Manager when applicable.
 22                                                          30SWI13-201 31 OCTOBER 2011


   2.21.3. The 30 CES/CEO and CEOF will participate in a monthly or quarterly meeting or
   inspection with the Airfield Manager/Representative/Facility Manager when there is an
   agenda.
2.22. Airfield hazards.
   2.22.1. AMOPS will notify the Tower, command post and transient pilots of any changes in
   airfield conditions.
2.23. Local Bird/Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program. This program is managed by
Flight Safety (30 SW/SEF) IAW AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
Management Techniques. Specific guidelines, roles, and responsibilities are contained in 30 SW
Plan 91-202, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard.
   2.23.1. Bird Watch Conditions (BWC) inform aircrews of dangerous bird activity around the
   airfield and establish operational limitations to maintain the proper level of safety (AMOPS
   personnel and Flight Safety are responsible for declaring the BWC). AMOPS personnel are
   responsible for harassment of birds on the airfield. The BWCs are defined as follows:
       2.23.1.1. Low: Normal bird activity on and above the airfield with a low probability of
       hazard.
       2.23.1.2. Moderate: Increased bird population in locations which represents an increased
       potential for strike. This condition requires increased vigilance by all agencies and
       supervisors and caution by aircrews.
       2.23.1.3. Severe: High bird population on or immediately above the active runway or
       other specific location that represents a high potential for strike. Supervisors and
       aircrews must thoroughly evaluate mission needs before conducting operations in areas
       under condition SEVERE.
   2.23.2. Operating restrictions during increased wildlife and bird activities will be tailored to
   the observed bird activities. Although restrictions will vary dependent upon the type and
   location of wildlife and bird activity.
       2.23.2.1. At any time, if deer are seen near the runway, AMOPS personnel will attempt
       to herd them away. Tower will delay take-off and landing for fixed-wing aircraft until
       the runway environment can be cleared. Helicopter operations will not be restricted, but
       helicopter crews will be advised of the areas of deer activity.
       2.23.2.2. During BWC low, there are no restrictions to aircraft operations.
       2.23.2.3. During BWC moderate:
          2.23.2.3.1. Local pattern and transitional work will be kept to a minimum.
          2.23.2.3.2. For low level flight, change flight altitudes to minimize bird hazards.
          2.23.2.3.3. During low level flight, specific areas and altitudes will be specified and
          avoided.
(EXAMPLE: Santa Ynez River area below 1,000’ – avoid). Alternate routes will be chosen if
available.
       2.23.2.4. During BWC severe:
30SWI13-201 31 OCTOBER 2011                                                                  23


           2.23.2.4.1. Only straight-in approaches to full stop landings are permitted.
           2.23.2.4.2. Operational commanders will consider delaying departures and arrivals
           and diverting aircraft.
2.24. Runway Surface Condition (RSC). During rapid changing conditions (e.g., rain showers
in vicinity, thunderstorms within 10 NM) AMOPS will increase RSC checks as conditions
warrant to ensure aircrews are provided with the most timely and accurate information. Only
AMOPS may close portions or all of the movement areas. Tower may suspend air traffic
operations to any portion of the movement areas when conditions warrant.
   2.24.1. AMOPS is responsible for determining RSC.
   2.24.2. AMOPS will determine the RSC (either wet or dry), and if able will estimate and
   report RSC to the nearest 1/10 of an inch.
   2.24.3. AMOPS will Disseminate RSC data to Tower, command post, send applicable
   NOTAMs, and update the Airfield Automation System IDS5 (AFAS).
2.25. Runway Condition Reading (RCR). RCRs are not available at Vandenberg.
2.26. Tower Visual and Radio Blind Spots.
   2.26.1. The following areas are not visible from the Tower:
   2.26.2. Area directly above and below the Tower.
   2.26.3. The ramp area South of Building 1735 hangar is a visual and radio blind spot from
   the Tower.
   2.26.4. The last 6000 feet of Runway 30 (first 6000 feet of Runway 12) and overrun, and
   surrounding airfield areas are visual blind spots due to siting of the Tower. Small-medium
   sized aircraft, vehicles, equipment and personnel are often difficult to see and, at times,
   cannot be seen in these areas.
2.27. Instrument Landing System (ILS) Critical Areas. ILS Critical Areas consist of the
Runway 30 Localizer Critical Area, the Runway 30 Glide Slope Critical Area, the Runway 12
Localizer Critical Area, and the Runway 12 glideslope Critical Area. ILS Critical areas are part
of the CMA. See Attachment 8 for depiction of Runway 30 Localizer and Runway 12 glideslope
Critical Areas. See Attachment 9 for depiction of Runway 12 Localizer and Runway 30
Glideslope Critical Areas.
   2.27.1. Runway 12 Localizer Critical Area (USAF standard). This rectangular area extends
   from the localizer transmitting antenna 2,000 feet toward the approach end of the runway and
   150 feet on each side of the runway centerline. It includes a 50-feet extension behind the
   localizer antenna.
   2.27.2. Runway 12 Glide Slope Critical Area (USAF standard). This is a fan-shaped area
   that extends from the runway 12 glideslope antenna 1,300 feet towards the approach end of
   runway 12. It covers an area 30 degrees each side of a line drawn through the glideslope
   antenna and parallel to the runway centerline.
   2.27.3. Runway 30 Localizer Critical Area (FAA standard). This mostly rectangular area
   begins 50 feet behind the localizer transmitting antenna and extends outward laterally to a
   distance of 75 feet from each side of the runway extended centerline. It is then angled,
 24                                                         30SWI13-201 31 OCTOBER 2011


   extending outward towards the approach end of the runway at 45 degrees from the runway
   centerline on each side of the runway centerline until reaching a distance of 300 feet from the
   runway centerline on each side. It then extends parallel to the runway towards the approach
   end to equal a total length of 2,050 feet.
   2.27.4. Runway 30 Glide Slope Critical Area (FAA standard). This mostly rectangular area
   extends parallel to the runway from the 30 glideslope antenna 3,100 feet towards the
   approach end of runway 30 and extends in width from the glideslope antenna up to the edge
   of the runway and 200 feet south of the glideslope antenna for a total width of 600 feet.
2.28. Precision Obstacle Free Zones (POFZ).
   2.28.1. Runway 30 and 12 Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ). The POFZ area is a 200
   feet long by 800 feet wide rectangular shaped area that begins at the runway 30 threshold and
   extends laterally 400 feet on each side of the runway centerline and extends 200 feet towards
   and into the overruns and surrounding areas.
NOTE: The Runway 30 POFZ hold line sign is identified as the ―ILS‖ hold line.
2.29. Protection of NAVAID Critical and POFZ Areas.
   2.29.1. When the airfield is open, Tower will apply procedures in AFI 13-204 Volume 3,
   FAA JO 6750.16D, Siting Criteria for Instrument Landing Systems and FAA JO 7110.65, Air
   Traffic Control, to protect ILS Critical Areas (AF standard for Runway 12 Localizer and
   Glideslope Critical Areas and FAA standard for Runway 30 Localizer and Glideslope
   Critical Areas) and control vehicle/aircraft access to these areas. When the airfield is open,
   vehicles must request approval from Tower prior to entering these areas.
   2.29.2. When the airfield is closed, ILS Critical Areas and POFZs are not protected. If
   vehicles, personnel, or equipment are in the ILS Critical Areas and POFZs, aircraft on
   approach may receive erroneous azimuth or glideslope indications. Persons needing to enter
   ILS Critical Areas when airfield is closed must first contact Command Post. Contact
   Command Post again when leaving these areas.
2.30. Inertial Navigation System (INS) Checkpoints. Three INS checkpoints are available on
the airfield. Specifications are posted in AMOPS or available through pilot to dispatch radio.
The designated INS checkpoints are:
   2.30.1. INS 1 – DV aircraft parking spot in front of the Tower. Coordinates: 34°44.0’ N,
   120°34.2’ W. Magnetic Variation: 14.1° E. Elevation: 344 ft MSL.

2.32. Runway Selection Procedures.
   2.32.1. Runway 30 is designated as the calm wind and primary instrument runway.
   2.32.2. Use runway 30 when wind is less than 5 knots unless use of another runway will be
   operationally advantageous, or is requested by the pilot.
   2.32.3. Tower will designate the active runway as the runway most nearly aligned with the
   wind when 5 knots or more, or the calm wind runway (RWY 30) when less than 5 knots,
   unless use of another runway will be operationally advantageous or is requested by the pilot
   IAW FAA JO 7110.65 Air Traffic Control. Tower will notify the following agencies of the
   active runway in use when opening the airfield and when changing the active runway.
       2.32.3.1. Santa Barbara Approach (SBA Approach) or Los Angeles Air Route Traffic
       Control Center (ZLA ARTCC) (depending on which facility is providing service).

                                      EMERGENCIES

3.1. In-Flight and Ground Emergencies.
   3.1.1. During periods when the airfield is open:
       3.1.1.1. Tower will:
          3.1.1.1.1. Gather information; activate the Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS) and
          provide follow-up information.
          3.1.1.1.2. Advise on-scene commander when the aircraft is 10 miles out and when it
          is the next aircraft to land.
NOTES: The on-scene commander will be the senior fire official unless and until relieved by
the designated representative of the installation commander, IAW VAFB CEMP 10-2,
Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan. During actual emergencies all first responders
(i.e. FD, AMOPS, SFS etc.) may exceed established speed limits, taking into account driving
conditions. First responders are exempt from conducting a FOD check when responding to an
actual emergency until emergency terminates. All drivers MUST obtain approval from the
Tower prior to entering the controlled movement area and/or runway.
          3.1.1.1.3. Give priority to emergency vehicles and suspend runway operations except
          for rescue and emergency aircraft when:
              3.1.1.1.3.1. An emergency aircraft is within 7 miles of the runway.
              3.1.1.1.3.2. An aircraft accident occurs on the runway or in the immediate
              vicinity of the runway.
              3.1.1.1.3.3. A hazardous situation exists in the airfield environment that poses a
              hazard to flight operations.
          3.1.1.1.4. Relinquish control of the runway to the on-scene commander once the
          aircraft has landed and been brought to a stop unless circumstances prevent this (e.g.,
          additional emergency aircraft that require landing).
          3.1.1.1.5. Resume normal runway operations after the Airfield Manager or
          designated representative reopens the runway.
       3.1.1.2. AMOPS will:
          3.1.1.2.1. Activate the Secondary Crash Network (SCN).
          3.1.1.2.2. Advise Tower when runway operations are suspended or may be resumed.
          3.1.1.2.3. Dispatch AMOPS personnel to the airfield to suspend runway/airfield ops
          as needed.
          3.1.1.2.4. Plot grid coordinates/cordon/ECPs and send NOTAMS as applicable.
          3.1.1.2.5. Prior to resuming runway operations, AMOPS personnel must conduct an
          airfield check of all affected areas.
 28                                                           30SWI13-201 31 OCTOBER 2011


       3.1.1.3. The on-scene commander will:
           3.1.1.3.1. Determine the level of emergency response consistent with the nature of
           the emergency.
           3.1.1.3.2. Assume control of the runway upon notification from Tower and return
           control to the Tower when emergency access is no longer needed.
   3.1.2. During periods when the airfield is closed:
NOTE: The CP will likely be the first agency to be notified of an in-flight or ground emergency
when the airfield is closed. Due to the time required for personnel to arrive and conduct airfield
inspections, it is highly unlikely that the airfield can be opened in time to provide normal ATC
and AMOPS services.
       3.1.2.1. Upon initial contact with the emergency aircraft (if in-flight emergency), CP
       may advise the aircrew of the following:
           3.1.2.1.1. The airfield is closed and that Tower, AMOPS, and Transient Aircraft
           Maintenance will not be immediately available.
           3.1.2.1.2. That a wildlife hazard exists and that the runway cannot be checked prior
           to the aircraft landing.
           3.1.2.1.3. The ILS is unmonitored and that the ILS Critical Area is not protected.
           3.1.2.1.4. The airfield is uncontrolled and that personnel or vehicles may be on the
           landing surface.
       3.1.2.2. If, after receiving this information, the pilot elects to land at Vandenberg, CP
       will:
           3.1.2.2.1. Acquire pertinent emergency information such landing runway and nature
           of emergency.
           3.1.2.2.2. Initiate the Secondary Crash Network.
           3.1.2.2.3. Inform AMOPS, Transient Aircraft Maintenance, and 30 SW/SEF standby
           personnel.
           3.1.2.2.4. Inform the 30 OSS/CC.
       3.1.2.3. The on-scene commander will:
           3.1.2.3.1. Take control of the runway and movement area when released by the
           Tower.
           3.1.2.3.2. Determine whether to request ambulance support.
           3.1.2.3.3. Once the aircraft has landed and is determined fire safe, have the pilot shut
           down the engines, then chock the aircraft.
       3.1.2.4. AMOPS will respond to the airfield as soon as practical to determine runway
       condition and whether or not the aircraft needs to be repositioned.
       3.1.2.5. TAMAGE will respond to ensure the aircraft is safely parked and/or moved as
       deemed necessary by the Airfield Manager.
30SWI13-201 31 OCTOBER 2011                                                                 29


       3.1.2.6. 30 SW/SEF will respond as required to begin a safety investigation.
3.2. Crash Phone and Emergency Notification.
   3.2.1. The PCAS provides the Tower with an immediate means of relaying emergency
   information. Tower shall activate the primary PCAS for the following:
       3.2.1.1. Pilot declares an emergency or an aircraft mishap occurs in the base response
       jurisdiction.
       3.2.1.2. 30 OG/CC or designated representative declares an emergency.
       3.2.1.3. Tower declares an emergency IAW FAA JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control.

                     AIRCRAFT REQUIRING SPECIAL HANDLING

6.1. Hazardous Cargo/Hot Armament Operations.
   6.1.1. Any base agency receiving information on hazardous cargo airlift or aircraft mission
   information requiring hot armament support is required to pass the information to AMOPS as
   soon as practical.
   6.1.2. When transient aircraft carrying hazardous cargo arrive at Vandenberg AFB, AMOPS
   and Tower will coordinate necessary changes in airfield status. Hazardous cargo loading or
   unloading will require closure of appropriate portions of the airfield to protect unrelated
   personnel and property. 30 SW Weapons Safety personnel notified be notified/consulted
   concerning appropriate actions for hazardous cargo.
   6.1.3. There are two hazardous cargo pads located on Vandenberg’s airfield. The primary
   pad is located on the northwest end of Taxiway A, while the alternate pad is located on the
   opposite end of Taxiway A (See Attachments 6 and 7). The pads are located to allow
   simultaneous hazardous cargo loading or unloading operations, if required. These pads are
   sited for 1.1 thru 1.3 each, IAW AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards, with varying
   Net Explosive Weights. When an aircraft carrying hazardous cargo is parked on one of the
   pads, no vehicles or persons will enter the closed area unless directly involved with the
   operation.
   6.1.4. If the primary hazardous cargo pad is used, Taxiway A from Taxiway D north to the
   runway hold line will be closed. If the alternate pad is used, Taxiway A from the helipad
   south to the runway hold line, and the helicopter slide area, will be closed. Aircraft
   operations on the runway are unaffected by these restrictions.
   6.1.5. Following coordination with TAMAGE, Tower directs aircraft with hazardous cargo
   to the primary or alternate hazardous cargo parking area. Aircraft are normally directed to
   park facing northwest on the primary pad and southeast on the alternate pad to simplify
   convoy operations and loading or unloading of hazardous cargo.
   6.1.6. Hot armament areas are located on either end of Taxiway A (See Attachment 1).

   request is relayed to AMOPS who will coordinate with the law enforcement desk to
   determine if they can provide assistance.
   6.6.2. AMOPS will notify Command Post of the situation, if not already relayed via the
   crash net.
6.7. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Notification Procedures.
   6.7.1. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Lounge. Maintenance of the DV Lounge located in
   building 1746 with the exception of routine janitorial service provided by contractor
   personnel, is the responsibility of the wing Protocol office (30 SW/CCP).
   6.7.2. Airfield Flags and Marquee.
      6.7.2.1. Requests for airfield flags shall be made to 30 OSS/OSA. It is preferred that
      notification occurs no later than 48 hours prior to the scheduled event. Flags will be
      raised for all three-stars/equivalent and above. Flags will be raised NLT one hour prior to
      the scheduled arrival of DV aircraft. Flags will not be raised during weather warnings or
      advisories where wind gusts exceed 25 knots.
      6.7.2.2. 30 SW/CCP is responsible for marquee input, content and approval. 30
      OSS/OSAA maintains a connection for updating the marquee. All AMOPS personnel
      shall be trained to input messages.

following restrictions within R-2516 and R-2517 ensure base compliance with federal laws and
regulations protecting these species and their habitats. Waivers must be coordinated through the
30th Civil Engineer Environmental Flight (30 CES/CEANC).
   7.7.1. Description of Area and Operational Restrictions.
       7.7.1.1. Point Sal/Lion Rock supports pinnipeds (harbor seals, California sea lions) that
       are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. This area must be avoided year-
       round by a minimum 1,000 ft slant range. The pinnipeds haul out at Lion’s Head is also
       subject to the 1,000 foot minimum altitude area.
       7.7.1.2. Purisima Point (VBG R-283/3 DME) and the neighboring terrain along the
       shoreline to SLC 57606-E is the nesting area for the endangered California Least Tern
       and the threatened Western Snowy Plover. All aircraft will avoid overflight of this area
       at a slant range less than 1,900 ft MSL from 1 March through 30 September each year.
       The Federal Endangered Species Act prohibits disrupting the nesting birds during this
       time. From October through February, a 1,000 ft minimum altitude applies due to marine
       mammal haul-out in this area. Marine mammals are protected from unauthorized
       harassment under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
       7.7.1.3. The following areas provide habitat for the threatened Western Snowy Plover
       and must be avoided year-round by a minimum 500 ft slant range: Minuteman Beach to
       Purisima Point; from 1.1 mile north to 3.7 miles south of the Santa Ynez River mouth
       (Wall and Surf Beach); and Jalama Beach.
NOTE: 2 ROPS/DON is exempt from this requirement per MOU between Vandenberg AFB
and the California Department of Fish and Game regarding Air Force Activities in Vandenberg
Marine Resources Protection Act (MRPA) Ecological Reserve.
       7.7.1.4. The Vandenberg Marine Ecological Reserve protects the shoreline between
       Point Pedernales/Honda Point and Oil Well Canyon (just northwest of the Boathouse).
       Protected resources along this 3-mile section of the shoreline include marine mammals
       and nesting seabirds. A minimum 1,000 ft slant range restriction applies year-round.
   7.7.2. Procedures.
       7.7.2.1. Aircraft are likely to cause disruptions in the area of Purisima Point during
       standard (southwest of runway) VFR traffic pattern operations. Therefore, the Tower
       will enforce the following procedures from 1 March to 30 September each year (or when
       notified by Installation CC that plover nesting season has started or completed):
           7.7.2.1.1. Circling approaches to the southwest are prohibited unless an operational
           necessity dictates otherwise.

          7.7.2.1.2. For right traffic to Runway 12, aircraft conducting rectangular/closed
          traffic patterns will be advised to delay base turn until abeam Point Purisima or 3
          DME.
          7.7.2.1.3. For left traffic to Runway 30, aircraft conducting rectangular/closed traffic
          patterns will be advised to execute crosswind turn prior to the departure end of the
          runway. If unable to execute crosswind turn prior to the departure end of the runway,
          fly runway heading and climb to 1,900 ft MSL before turning crosswind.
7.8. Cooperative Weather Reporting.
   7.8.1. Tower personnel will advise the weather observer if on-duty or duty forecaster (24
   hours, at Weather Operations Center) of any unusual weather activity as defined in 30 SWI
   15-101, Weather Support Procedures. Tower personnel will also advise any affected
   aircraft.
7.9. Airfield Activities during Lightning Warnings.
   7.9.1. During weather warnings for observed lightning within 10 miles of the airfield, all
   routine outdoor activity on the airfield will cease. Aircraft departures and arrivals will be at
   the discretion of the aircraft commander or operator.
7.10. Transient Helicopter and Aircraft Operations.
   7.10.1. During Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC), transient helicopters can use the
   runway or other areas as approved or directed by Tower.
   7.10.2. During Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC), transient helicopters will use
   the runway. Operations at other locations on the airfield may be approved by the Tower
   upon pilot request.
